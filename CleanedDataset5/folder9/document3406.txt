RAGGED LADY

By William Dean Howells




Part 2



XV

Mrs Lander went to a hotel in New York where she had been in the habit
of staying with her husband on their way South or North The clerk knew
her and shook hands with her across the register and said she could
have her old rooms if she wanted them the bellboy who took up their
handbaggage recalled himself to her the elevatorboy welcomed her with
a smile of remembrance

Since she was already up from coming off the sleepingcar she had no
excuse for not going to breakfast like other people and she went with
Clementina to the diningroom where the headwaiter who found them
places spoke with an outlandish accent and the waiter who served them
had a parlance that seemed superficially English but was inwardly
something else there was even a touch in the cooking of the familiar
dishes that needed translation for the girls inexperienced palate She
was finding a refuge in the strangeness of everything when she was
startled by the sound of a familiar voice calling Clementina Claxon
Well I was sure all along it was you and I determined I wouldnt stand
it another minute Why child how you have changed Why I declare you
are quite a woman When did you come How pretty you are Mrs Milray took
Clementina in her arms and kissed her in proof of her admiration before
the whole breakfast room She was very nice to Mrs Lander too who
when Clementina introduced them made haste to say that Clementina was
there on a visit with her Mrs Milray answered that she envied her such
a visitor as Miss Claxon and protested that she should steal her away
for a visit to herself if Mr Milray was not so much in love with her
that it made her jealous Mr Milray has to have his breakfast in his
room she explained to Clementina Hes not been so well since he lost
his mother Yes she said with decorous solemnity Im still in
mourning for her and Clementina saw that she was in a tempered black
She died last year and now Im taking Mr Milray abroad to see if it
wont cheer him up a little Are you going South for the winter she
inquired politely of Mrs Lander I wish I was going she said when
Mrs Lander guessed they should go later on Well you must come in and
see me all you can Clementina and I shall have the pleasure of calling
upon you she added to Mrs Lander with state that was lost in the
soubrettelike volatility of her flight from them the next moment
Goodness I forgot all about Mr Milrays breakfast She ran back to
the table she had left on the other side of the room

Who is that Clementina asked Mrs Lander on their way to their
rooms Clementina explained as well as she could and Mrs Lander summed
up her feeling in the verdict Well shes a lady if ever I saw a lady
and you dont see many of em nowadays

The girl remembered how Mrs Milray had once before seemed very fond of
her and had afterwards forgotten the pretty promises and professions she
had made her But she went with Mrs Lander to see her and she saw Mr
Milray too for a little while He seemed glad of their meeting but
still depressed by the bereavement which Mrs Milray supported almost
with gayety When he left them she explained that he was a good deal away
from her with his family as she approved of his being though she had
apparently no wish to join him in all the steps of the reconciliation
which the mothers death had brought about among them Sometimes his
sisters came to the hotel to see her but she amused herself perfectly
without them and she gave much more of her leisure to Clementina and
Mrs Lander

She soon knew the whole history of the relation between them and the
first time that Clementina found her alone with Mrs Lander she could
have divined that Mrs Lander had been telling her of the Fane affair
even if Mrs Milray had not at once called out to her I know all about
it and Ill tell you what Clementina Im going to take you over with
me and marry you to an English Duke Mrs Lander and I have been planning
it all out and Im going to send down to the steamer office and engage
your passage Its all settled

When she was gone Mrs Lander asked What do you spose your folks
would say to your goin to Europe anyway Clementina as if the matter
had been already debated between them

Clementina hesitated I should want to be sua Mrs Milray really wanted
me to go ova with her

Why didnt you hear her say so demanded Mrs Lander

Yes sighed Clementina Mrs Lander I think Mrs Milray means what
she says at the time but she is one that seems to forget

She thinks the wold of you Mrs Lander urged

She was very nice to me that summer at Middlemount I guess maybe she
would like to have us go with her the girl relented

I guess well wait and see said Mrs Lander I shouldnt want she
should change her mind when it was too late as you say They were both
silent for a time and then Mrs Lander resumed But I presume she
hant got the only steams thats crossin What should you say about
goin over on some otha steams I been South a good many wintas and I
should feel kind of lonesome goin round to the places where I been with
Mr Landa I felt it since I been here in this hotel some and I cant
seem to want to go ova the same ground again well not right away

Clementina said Why of couse Mrs Landa

Should you be willin asked Mrs Lander after another little pause
if your folks was willin to go ova thea to some of them European
countries to spend the winta

Oh yes indeed said Clementina

They discussed the matter in one of the full talks they both liked At
the end Mrs Lander said Well I guess you betta write home and ask
your motha whetha you can go sot if we take the notion we can go any
time Tell her to telegraph if shell let you and do write all the ifs
and ands sot shell know just how to answa without havin to have you
write again

That evening Mrs Milray came to their table from where she had been
dining alone and asked in banter Well have you made up your minds to
go over with me

Mrs Lander said bluntly We cant hadly believe you really want us to
Mrs Milray

I dont want you Who put such an idea into your head Oh I know She
threatened Clementina with the doorkey which she was carrying in her
hand It was you was it What an artful suspicious thing Whats got
into you child Do you hate me She did not give Clementina time to
protest Well now I can just tell you I do want you and Ill be quite
heartbroken if you dont come

Well she wrote to her friends this mohning Mrs Lander said but I
guess she wont git an answa in time for youa steamer even if they do
let her go

Oh yes she will Mrs Milray protested Its all right now youve
got to go and theres no use trying to get out of it

She came to them whenever she could find them in the diningroom and she
knocked daily at their door till she knew that Clementina had heard from
home The girls mother wrote without a punctuation mark in her letter
but with a great deal of sense that such a thing as her going to Europe
could not be settled by telegraph She did not think it worth while to
report all the facts of a consultation with the rector which they had
held upon getting Clementinas request and which had renewed all the
original question of her relations with Mrs Lander in an intensified
form He had disposed of this upon much the same terms as before and
they had yielded more readily because the experiment had so far
succeeded Clementina had apparently no complaint to make of Mrs Lander
she was eager to go and the rector and his wife who had been invited to
be of the council were both of the opinion that a course of European
travel would be of the greatest advantage to the girl if she wished to
fit herself for teaching It was an opportunity that they must not think
of throwing away If Mrs Lander went to Florence as it seemed from
Clementinas letter she thought of doing the girl would pass a
delightful winter in study of one of the most interesting cities in the
world and she would learn things which would enable her to do better for
herself when she came home than she could ever hope to do otherwise She
might never marry Mr Richling suggested and it was only right and fair
that she should be equipped with as much culture as possible for the
struggle of life Mrs Richling agreed with this rather vague theory but
she was sure that Clementina would get married to greater advantage in
Florence than anywhere else They neither of them really knew anything at
first hand about Florence the rectors opinion was grounded on the
thought of the joy that a sojourn in Italy would have been to him his
wife derived her hope of a Florentine marriage for Clementina from
several romances in which love and travel had gone hand in hand to the
lasting credit of triumphant American girlhood

The Claxons were not able to enter into their view of the case but if
Mrs Lander wanted to go to Florence instead of Florida they did not see
why Clementina should not go with her to one place as well as the other
They were not without a sense of flattery from the fact that their
daughter was going to Europe but they put that as far from them as they
could the mother severely and the father ironically as something too
silly and they tried not to let it weigh with them in making up their
mind but to consider only Clementinas best good and not even to regard
her pleasure Her mother put before her the most crucial questions she
could think of in her letter and then gave her full leave from her
father as well as herself to go if she wished

Clementina had rather it had been too late to go with the Milrays but
she felt bound to own her decision when she reached it and Mrs Milray
whatever her real wish was made it a point of honor to help get Mrs
Lander berths on her steamer It did not require much effort there are
plenty of berths for the latestcomers on a winter passage and
Clementina found herself the fellow passenger of Mrs Milray




XVI

As soon as Mrs Lander could make her way to her stateroom she got into
her berth and began to take the different remedies for seasickness
which she had brought with her Mrs Milray said that was nice and that
now she and Clementina could have a good time But before it came to that
she had taken pity on a number of lonely young men whom she found on
board She cheered them up by walking round the ship with them but if
any of them continued dull in spite of this she dropped him and took
another and before she had been two days out she had gone through with
nearly all the lonely young men on the list of cabin passengers She
introduced some of them to Clementina but at such times as she had them
in charge and for the most part she left her to Milray Once as the
girl sat beside him in her steamerchair Mrs Milray shed a wrap on his
knees in whirring by on the arm of one of her young men with some
laughed and shouted charge about it

What did she say he asked Clementina slanting the downpulled brim of
his soft hat purblindly toward her

She said she had not understood and then Milray asked What sort of
person is that Boston youth of Mrs Milrays Is he a donkey or a lamb

Clementina said ingenuously Oh shes walking with that English
gentleman nowthat lod

Ah yes said Milray Hes not very much to look at I hear

Well not very much Clementina admitted she did not like to talk
against people

Lords are sometimes disappointing Clementina Milray said but then
so are other great men Ive seen politicians on our side who were
disappointing and there are clergymen and gamblers who dont look it
He laughed sadly Thats the way people talk who are a little
disappointing themselves I hope you dont expect too much of yourself
Clementina

I dont know what you mean she said stiffening with a suspicion that
he might be going to make fun of her

He laughed more gayly Well I mean we must hold the other fellows up to
their duty or we cant do our own We need their example Charity may
begin at home but duty certainly begins abroad He went on as if it
were a branch of the same inquiry Did you ever meet my sisters They
came to the hotel in New York to see Mrs Milray

Yes I was in the room once when they came in

Did you like them

YesI scacely spoke to themI only stayed a moment

Would you like to see any more of the family

Why of couse Clementina was amused at his asking but he seemed in
earnest

One of my sisters lives in Florence and Mrs Milray says you think of
going there too

Mrs Landa thought it would be a good place to spend the winter Is it a
pleasant place

Oh delightful Do you know much about Italy

Not very much I dont believe

Well my sister has lived a good while in Florence I should like to
give you a letter to her

Oh thank you said Clementina

Milray smiled at her spare acknowledgment but inquired gravely What do
you expect to do in Florence

Why I presume whateva Mrs Landa wants to do

Do you think Mrs Lander will want to go into society

This question had not occurred to Clementina I dont believe she will
she said thoughtfully

Shall you

Clementina laughed Why do you think she ventured that society
would want me to

Yes I think it would if youre as charming as youve tried to make me
believe Oh I dont mean to your own knowledge but some people have
ways of being charming without knowing it If Mrs Lander isnt going
into society and there should be a way found for you to go dont
refuse will you

I shall wait and see if Im asked fust

Yes that will be best said Milray But I shall give you a letter to
my sister She and I used to be famous cronies and we went to a great
many parties together when we were young people We thought the world was
a fine thing then But it changes

He fell into a muse and they were both sitting quite silent when Mrs
Milray came round the corner of the music room in the course of her
twentieth or thirtieth compass of the deck and introduced her lord to
her husband and to Clementina He promptly ignored Milray and devoted
himself to the girl leaning over her with his hand against the bulkhead
behind her and talking down upon her

Lord Lioncourt must have been about thirty but he had the heated and
broken complexion of a man who has taken more than is good for him in
twice that number of years This was one of the wrongs nature had done
him in apparent resentment of the social advantages he was born to for
he was rather abstemious as Englishmen go He looked a very shy person
till he spoke and then you found that he was not in the least shy He
looked so English that you would have expected a strong English accent of
him but his speech was more that of an American without the nasality
This was not apparently because he had been much in America he was
returning from his first visit to the States which had been spent
chiefly in the Territories after a brief interval of Newport he had
preferred the West he liked rather to hunt than to be hunted though
even in the West his main business had been to kill time which he found
more plentiful there than other game The natives everywhere were much
the same thing to him if he distinguished it was in favor of those who
did not suppose themselves cultivated If again he had a choice it was
for the females they seemed to him more amusing than the males who
struck him as having an exaggerated reputation for humor He did not care
much for Clementinas past as he knew it from Mrs Milray and if it did
not touch his fancy it certainly did not offend his taste A real
artistocracy is above social prejudice when it will he had known some
of his order choose the mothers of their heirs from the music halls and
when it came to a question of distinctions among Americans he could not
feel them They might be richer or poorer but they could not be more
patrician or more plebeian

The passengers he told Clementina were getting up at this point of the
ships run an entertainment for the benefit of the seamans hospital in
Liverpool that wellknown convention of oceantravel which is sure at
some time or other to enlist all the talent on board every English
steamer in some sort of public appeal He was not very clear how he came
to be on the committee for drumming up talent for the occasion his
distinction seemed to have been conferred by a popular vote in the
smoking room as nearly as he could make out but here he was and he was
counting upon Miss Claxon to help him out He said Mrs Milray had told
him about that charming affair they had got up in the mountains and he
was sure they could have something of the kind again Perhaps not a
coaching party that mightnt be so easy to manage at sea But isnt
there something elsesome tableaux or something If we couldnt have the
months of the year we might have the points of the compass and you could
take your choice

He tried to get something out of the notion but nothing came of it that
Mrs Milray thought possible She said across her husband on whose
further side she had sunk into a chair that they must have something
very informal everybody must do what they could separately I know you
can do anything you like Clementina Cant you play something or sing
At Clementinas look of utter denial she added desperately Or dance
something A light came into the girls face at which she caught I
know you can dance something Why of course Now what is it

Clementina smiled at her vehemence Why its nothing And I dont know
whether I should like to

Oh yes urged Lord Lioncourt Such a good cause you know

What is it Mrs Milray insisted Is it something you could do alone

Its just a dance that I learned at Woodlake The teacha said that all
the young ladies wee leaning it Its a skutdance

The very thing Mrs Milray shouted Itll be the hit of the evening

But Ive never done it before any one Clementina faltered

Theyll all be doing their turns the Englishman said Speaking and
singing and playing

Clementina felt herself giving way and she pleaded in final reluctance
But I havent got a pleated skut in my steama trunk

No matter We can manage that Mrs Milray jumped to her feet and took
Lord Lioncourts arm Now we must go and drum up somebody else He did
not seem eager to go but he started Then thats all settled she
shouted over her shoulder to Clementina

No no Mrs Milray Clementina called after her The ship tilts so

Nonsense Its the smoothest run she ever made in December And Ill
engage to have the sea as steady as a rock for you Remember now youve
promised

Mrs Milray whirled her Englishman away and left Clementina sitting
beside her husband

Did you want to dance for them Clementina he asked

I dont know she said with the vague smile of one to whom a pleasant
hope has occurred

I thought perhaps you were letting Mrs Milray bully you into it Shes
a frightful tyrant

Oh I guess I should like to do it if you think it would benice

I dare say it will be the nicest thing at their ridiculous show Milray
laughed as if her willingness to do the dance had defeated a sentimental
sympathy in him

I dont believe it will be that said Clementina beaming joyously
But I guess I shall try it if I can find the right kind of a dress

Is a pleated skirt absolutely necessary asked Milray gravely

I dont see how I could get on without it said Clementina

She was so serious still when she went down to her stateroom that Mrs
Lander was distracted from her potential ailments to ask What is it
Clementina

Oh nothing Mrs Milray has got me to say that I would do something at
a concert they ah going to have on the ship She explained Its that
skut dance I learnt at Woodlake of Miss Wilson

Well I guess if youre worryin about that you neednt to

Oh Im not worrying about the dance I was just thinking what I should
wear If I could only get at the trunks

It wont make any matte what you wear said Mrs Lander Itll be the
greatest thing and if t want for this seasickness that I have to
keep fightin off hea night and day I should come up and see you
myself You ah just lovely in that dance Clementina

Do you think so Mrs Landa asked the girl gratefully Well Mr
Milray didnt seem to think that I need to have a pleated skut Any rate
Im going to look over my things and see if I cant make something else
do




XVII

The entertainment was to be the second night after that and Mrs Milray
at first took the whole affair into her own hands She was willing to let
the others consult with her but she made all the decisions and she
became so prepotent that she drove Lord Lioncourt to rebellion in the
case of some theatrical people whom he wanted in the programme He wished
her to let them feel that they were favoring rather than favored and she
insisted that it should be quite the other way She professed a scruple
against having theatrical people in the programme at all which she might
not have felt if her own past had been different and she spoke with an
abhorrence of the stage which he could by no means tolerate in the case
She submitted with dignity when she could not help it Perhaps she
submitted with too much dignity Her concession verged upon hauteur and
in her arrogant meekness she went back to another of her young men whom
she began to post again as the companion of her promenades

He had rather an anxious air in the enjoyment of the honor but the
Englishman seemed unconscious of its loss or else he chose to ignore it
He frankly gave his leisure to Clementina and she thought he was very
pleasant There was something different in his way from that of any of
the other men she had met something very natural and simple a way of
being easy in what he was and not caring whether he was like others or
not he was not ashamed of being ignorant of anything he did not know
and she was able to instruct him on some points He took her quite
seriously when she told him about Middlemount and how her family came to
settle there and then how she came to be going to Europe with Mrs
Lander He said Mrs Milray had spoken about it but he had not
understood quite how it was before and he hoped Mrs Lander was coming
to the entertainment

He did not seem aware that Mrs Milray was leaving the affair more and
more to him He went forward with it and was as amiable with her as she
would allow He was so amiable with everybody that he reconciled many
true Americans to his leadership who felt that as nearly all the
passengers were Americans the chief patron of the entertainment ought to
have been some distinguished American The want of an American who was
very distinguished did something to pacify them but the behavior of an
English lord who put on no airs was the main agency When the night came
they filled the large music room of the Asia Minor and stood about in
front of the sofas and chairs so many deep that it was hard to see or
hear through them

They each paid a shilling admittance they were prepared to give
munificently besides when the hat came round and after the first burst
of blundering from Lord Lioncourt they led the magnanimous applause He
said he never minded making a bad speech in a good cause and he made as
bad a one as very well could be He closed it by telling Mark Twains
whistling story so that those who knew it by heart missed the point but
that might have been because he hurried it to get himself out of the way
of the others following When he had done one of the most ardent of the
Americans proposed three cheers for him

The actress whom he had secured in spite of Mrs Milray appeared in
womans dress contrary to her inveterate professional habit and followed
him with great acceptance in her favorite varietystage song and then
her husband gave imitations of Sir Henry Irving and of Miss Maggie Kline
in Trow him down McCloskey with a cockney accent A frightened
little girl whose mother had volunteered her talent gasped a ballad to
her mothers accompaniment and two young girls played a duet on the
mandolin and guitar A gentleman of cosmopolitan military tradition who
sold the pools in the smokingroom and was the friend of all the men
present and the acquaintance of several gave selections of his
autobiography prefatory to bellowing in a deep bass voice Theyre
hanging Danny Deaver and then a lady interpolated herself into the
programme with a kindness which Lord Lioncourt acknowledged in saying
The more the merrier and sang Bonnie Dundee thumping the piano out of
all proportion to her size and apparent strength

Some advances which Clementina had made for Mrs Milrays help about the
dress she should wear in her dance met with bewildering indifference and
she had fallen back upon her own devices She did not think of taking
back her promise and she had come to look forward to her part with a
happiness which the good weather and the even sway of the ship
encouraged But her pulses fluttered as she glided into the music room
and sank into a chair next Mrs Milray She had on an accordion skirt
which she had been able to get out of her trunk in the hold and she felt
that the glance of Mrs Milray did not refuse it approval

That will do nicely Clementina she said She added in careless
acknowledgement of her own failure to direct her choice I see you
didnt need my help after all and the thorny point which Clementina
felt in her praise was rankling when Lord Lioncourt began to introduce
her

He made rather a mess of it but as soon as he came to an end of his
wellmeant blunders she stood up and began her poses and paces It was
all very innocent with something courageous as well as appealing She
had a kind of tender dignity in her dance and the delicate beauty of her
face translated itself into the grace of her movements It was not
impersonal there was her own quality of sylvan of elegant in it but it
was unconscious and so far it was typical it was classic Mrs Milrays
Bostonian achieved a snub from her by saying it was like a Botticelli
and in fact it was merely the skirtdance which society had borrowed from
the stage at that period leaving behind the footlights its more
acrobatic phases but keeping its pretty turns and bows and bends
Clementina did it not only with tender dignity but when she was fairly
launched in it with a passion to which her sense of Mrs Milrays
strange unkindness lent defiance The dance was still so new a thing
then that it had a surprise to which the girls gentleness lent a
curious charm and it had some adventitious fascinations from the
necessity she was in of weaving it in and out among the stationary
armchairs and sofas which still further cramped the narrow space where
she gave it Her own delight in it shone from her smiling face which was
appealingly happy Just before it should have ended one of those
wandering waves that roam the smoothest sea struck the ship and
Clementina caught herself skilfully from falling and reeled to her seat
while the room rang with the applause and sympathetic laughter for the
mischance she had baffled There was a storm of encores but Clementina
called out The ship tilts so and her naivete won her another burst of
favor which was at its height when Lord Lioncourt had an inspiration

He jumped up and said Miss Claxon is going to oblige us with a little
bit of dramatics now and Im sure youll all enjoy that quite as much
as her beautiful dancing Shes going to take the principal part in the
laughable afterpiece of Passing round the Hat and I hope the audience
willaaado the rest Shes consented on this occasion to use a
hator cap ratherof her own the charming Tam OShanter in which
weve all seen her andaadmired her about the ship for the week
past

He caught up the flat woolen steamercap which Clementina had left in her
seat beside Mrs Milray when she rose to dance and held it aloft Some
one called out Chorus For hes a jolly good fellow and led off in
his praise Lord Lioncourt shouted through the uproar the announcement
that while Miss Claxon was taking up the collection Mr Ewins of
Boston would sing one of the student songs of Cambridgeno
HarvardUniversity the music being his own

Everyone wanted to make some joke or some compliment to Clementina about
the cap which grew momently heavier under the sovereigns and half
sovereigns half crowns and half dollars shillings quarters greenbacks
and every fraction of English and American silver and the actor who had
given the imitations made bold as he said to ask his lordship if the
audience might not hope before they dispersed for something more from
Miss Claxon He was sure she could do something more he for one would be
glad of anything and Clementina turned from putting her cap into Mrs
Milrays lap to find Lord Lioncourt bowing at her elbow and offering
her his arm to lead her to the spot where she had stood in dancing

The joy of her triumph went to her head she wished to retrieve herself
from any shadow of defeat

She stood panting a moment and then if she had had the professional
instinct she would have given her admirers the surprise of something
altogether different from what had pleased them before That was what the
actor would have done but Clementina thought of how her dance had been
brought to an untimely close by the rolling of the ship she burned to do
it all as she knew it no matter how the sea behaved and in another
moment she struck into it again This time the sea behaved perfectly and
the dance ended with just the swoop and swirl she had meant it to have at
first The spectators went generously wild over her they cheered and
clapped her and crowded upon her to tell how lovely it was but she
escaped from them and ran back to the place where she had left Mrs
Milray She was not there and Clementinas cap full of alms lay
abandoned on the chair Lord Lioncourt said he would take charge of the
money if she would lend him her cap to carry it in to the purser and
she made her way into the saloon In a distant corner she saw Mrs Milray
with Mr Ewins

She advanced in a vague dismay toward them and as she came near Mrs
Milray said to Mr Ewins I dont like this place Lets go over
yonder She rose and rushed him to the other end of the saloon

Lord Lioncourt came in looking about Ah have you found her he asked
gayly There were twenty pounds in your cap and two hundred dollars

Yes said Clementina shes over thea She pointed and then shrank
and slipped away




XVIII

At breakfast Mrs Milray would not meet Clementinas eye she talked to
the people across the table in a loud lively voice and then suddenly
rose and swept past her out of the saloon

The girl did not see her again till Mrs Milray came up on the promenade
at the hour when people who have eaten too much breakfast begin to spoil
their appetite for luncheon with the tea and bouillon of the
deckstewards She looked fiercely about and saw Clementina seated in
her usual place but with Lord Lioncourt in her own chair next her
husband and Ewins on foot before her They were both talking to
Clementina whom Lord Lioncourt was accusing of being in low spirits
unworthy of her last nights triumphs He jumped up and offered his
place Ive got your chair Mrs Milray

Oh no she said coldly I was just coming to look after Mr Milray
But I see hes in good hands

She turned away as if to make the round of the deck and Ewins hurried
after her He came back directly and said that Mrs Milray had gone into
the library to write letters He stayed uneasily trying to talk but
with the air of a man who has been snubbed and has not got back his
composure

Lord Lioncourt talked on until he had used up the incidents of the night
before and the probabilities of their getting into Queenstown before
morning then he and Mr Ewins went to the smokingroom together and
Clementina was left alone with Milray

Clementina he said gently I dont see everything but isnt there
some trouble between you and Mrs Milray

Why I dont know what it can be answered the girl with trembling
lips Ive been trying to find out and I cant undastand it

Ah those things are often very obscure said Milray with a patient
smile

Clementina wanted to ask him if Mrs Milray had said anything to him
about her but she could not and he did not speak again till he heard
her stir in rising from her chair Then he said I havent forgotten
that letter to my sister Clementina I will give it to you before we
leave the steamer Are you going to stay in Liverpool over night or
shall you go up to London at once

I dont know It will depend upon how Mrs Landa feels

Well we shall see each other again Dont be worried He looked up at
her with a smile and he could not see how forlornly she returned it

As the day passed Mrs Milrays angry eyes seemed to search her out for
scorn whenever Clementina found herself the centre of her last nights
celebrity Many people came up and spoke to her at first with a certain
expectation of knowingness in her which her simplicity baffled Then
they either dropped her and went away or stayed and tried to make
friends with her because of this an elderly English clergyman and his
wife were at first compassionately anxious about her and then
affectionately attentive to her in her obvious isolation Clementinas
simplehearted response to their advances appeared to win while it
puzzled them and they seemed trying to divine her in the strange double
character she wore to their more single civilization The theatrical
people thought none the worse of her for her simpleheartedness
apparently they were both very sweet to her and wanted her to promise
to come and see them in their little box in St Johns Wood Once
indeed Clementina thought she saw relenting in Mrs Milrays glance but
it hardened again as Lord Lioncourt and Mr Ewins came up to her and
began to talk with her She could not go to her chair beside Milray for
his wife was now keeping guard of him on the other side with unexampled
devotion Lord Lioncourt asked her to walk with him and she consented
She thought that Mr Ewins would go and sit by Mrs Milray of course
but when she came round in her tour of the ship Mrs Milray was sitting
alone beside her husband

After dinner she went to the library and got a book but she could not
read there every chair was taken by people writing letters to send back
from Queenstown in the morning and she strayed into the ladies sitting
room where no ladies seemed ever to sit and lost herself in a miserable
muse over her open page

Some one looked in at the door and then advanced within and came
straight to Clementina she knew without looking up that it was Mrs
Milray I have been hunting for you Miss Claxon she said in a voice
frostily fierce and with a bearing furiously formal I have a letter to
Miss Milray that my busband wished me to write for you and give you with
his compliments

Thank you said Clementina She rose mechanically to her feet and at
the same time Mrs Milray sat down

You will find Miss Milray she continued with the same glacial
hauteur a very agreeable and cultivated lady

Clementina said nothing and Mrs Milray added

And I hope she may have the happiness of being more useful to you than I
have

What do you mean Mrs Milray Clementina asked with unexpected spirit
and courage

I mean simply this that I have not succeeded in putting you on your
guard against your love of admirationespecially the admiration of
gentlemen A young girl cant be too careful how she accepts the
attentions of gentlemen and if she seems to invite them

Mrs Milray cried Clementina How can you say such a thing to me

How I shall have to be plain with you I see Perhaps I have not
considered that after all you know nothing about life and are not to
blame for things that a person born and bred in the world would
understand from childhood If you dont know already I can tell you that
the way you have behaved with Lord Lioncourt during the last two or three
days and the way you showed your pleasure the other night in his
ridiculous flatteries of you was enough to make you the talk of the
whole steamer I advise you for your own sake to take my warning in time
You are very young and inexperienced and ignorant but that will not
save you in the eyes of the world if you keep on Mrs Milray rose And
now I will leave you to think of what I have said Here is the letter for
Miss Milray

Clementina shook her head I dont want it

You dont want it But I have written it at Mr Milrays request and I
shall certainly leave it with you

If you do said Clementina I shall not take it

And what shall I say to Mr Milray

What you have just said to me

What have I said to you

That Im a bold girl and that Ive tried to make men admia me

Mrs Milray stopped as if suddenly daunted by a fact that had not
occurred to her before Did I say that

The same as that

I didnt mean thatImerely meant to put you on your guard It may be
because you are so innocent yourself that you cant imagine what others
think andI did it out of my regard for you

Clementina did not answer

Mrs Milray went on That was why I was so provoked with you I think
that for a young girl to stand up and dance alone before a whole steamer
full of strangersClementina looked at her without speaking and Mrs
Milray hastened to say To be sure I advised you to do it but I
certainly was surprised that you should give an encore But no matter
now This letter

I cant take it Mrs Milray said Clementina with a swelling heart

Now listen urged Mrs Milray You think Im just saying it because
if you dont take it I shall have to tell Mr Milray I was so hateful to
you you couldnt Well I should hate to tell him that but that isnt
the reason There She tore the letter in pieces and threw it on the
floor Clementina did not make any sign of seeing this and Mrs Milray
dropped upon her chair again Oh how hard you are Cant you say
something to me

Clementina did not lift her eyes I dont feel like saying anything just
now

Mrs Milray was silent a moment Then she sighed Well you may hate me
but I shall always be your friend What hotel are you going to in
Liverpool

I dont know said Clementina

You had better come to the one where we go Im afraid Mrs Lander wont
know how to manage very well and weve been in Liverpool so often May I
speak to her about it

If you want to Clementina coldly assented

I see said Mrs Milray You dont want to be under the same roof with
me Well you neednt But Ill tell you a good hotel the one that the
trains start out of and Ill send you that letter for Miss Milray
Clementina was silent Well Ill send it anyway

Mrs Milray went away in sudden tears but the girl remained dryeyed




XIX

Mrs Lander realized when the ship came to anchor in the stream at
Liverpool that she had not been seasick a moment during the voyage In
the brisk cold of the winter morning as they came ashore in the tug she
fancied a property of health in the European atmosphere which she was
sure would bring her right up if she stayed long enough and a regret
that she had never tried it with Mr Lander mingled with her new hopes
for herself

But Clementina looked with homesick eyes at the strangeness of the alien
scene the pale low heaven which seemed not to be clouded and yet was so
dim the flat shores with the little railroad trains running in and out
over them the grimy bulks of the city and the shipping in the river
sparse and sombre after the gay forest of sails and stacks at New York

She did not see the Milrays after she left the tug in the rapid
dispersal of the steamers passengers They both took leave of her at the
dock and Mrs Milray whispered with penitence in her voice and eyes I
will write but the girl did not answer

Before Mrs Landers trunks and her own were passed she saw Lord
Lioncourt going away with his heavily laden man at his heels Mr Ewins
came up to see if he could help her through the customs but she believed
that he had come at Mrs Milrays bidding and she thanked him so
prohibitively that he could not insist The English clergyman who had
spoken to her the morning after the charity entertainment left his wife
with Mrs Lander and came to her help and then Mr Ewins went his way

The clergyman who appeared to feel the friendlessness of the young girl
and the old woman a charge laid upon him bestowed a sort of fatherly
protection upon them both He advised them to stop at a hotel for a few
hours and take the later train for London that he and his wife were going
up by they drove to the hotel together where Mrs Lander could not be
kept from paying the omnibus and made them have luncheon with her She
allowed the clergyman to get her tickets and she could not believe that
he had taken second class tickets for himself and his wife She said that
she had never heard of anyone travelling second class before and she
assured him that they never did it in America She begged him to let her
pay the difference and bring his wife into her compartment which the
guard had reserved for her She urged that the money was nothing to her
compared with the comfort of being with some one you knew and the
clergyman had to promise that as they should be neighbors he would look
in upon her whenever the train stopped long enough

Before it began to move Clementina thought she saw Lord Lioncourt
hurrying past their carriagewindow At Rugby the clergyman appeared but
almost before he could speak Lord Lioncourts little red face showed at
his elbow He asked Clementina to present him to Mrs Lander who pressed
him to get into her compartment the clergyman vanished and Lord
Lioncourt yielded

Mrs Lander found him able to tell her the best way to get to Florence
whose situation he seemed to know perfectly he confessed that he had
been there rather often He made out a little itinerary for going
straight through by sleepingcar as soon as you crossed the Channel she
had said that she always liked a through train when she could get it and
the less stops the better She bade Clementina take charge of the plan
and not lose it without it she did not see what they could do She
conceived of him as a friend of Clementinas and she lost in the strange
environment the shyness she had with most people She told him how Mr
Lander had made his money and from what beginnings he rose to be
ignorant of what he really was worth when he died She dwelt upon the
diseases they had suffered and at the thought of his death so
unnecessary in view of the good that the air was already doing her in
Europe she shed tears

Lord Lioncourt was very polite but there was no resumption of the ships
comradery in his manner Clementina could not know how quickly this
always drops from people who have been fellowpassengers and she
wondered if he were guarding himself from her because she had danced at
the charity entertainment The poison which Mrs Milray had instilled
worked in her thoughts while she could not help seeing how patient he was
with all Mrs Landers questions he answered them with a simplicity of
his own or laughed and put them by when they were quite impossible
Many of them related to the comparative merits of English and American
railroads and what he thought himself of these Mrs Lander noted the
difference of the English stations but she did not see much in the
landscape to examine him upon She required him to tell her why the rooks
they saw were not crows and she was not satisfied that he should say the
country seat she pointed out was a castle when it was plainly deficient
in battlements She based upon his immovable confidence in respect to it
an inquiry into the structure of English society and she made him tell
her what a lord was and a commoner and how the royal family differed
from both She asked him how he came to be a lord and when he said that
it was a peerage of George the Thirds creation she remembered that
George III was the one we took up arms against She found that Lord
Lioncourt knew of our revolution generally but was ignorant of such
particulars as the Battle of Bunker Hill and the Surrender of
Cornwallis as well as the throwing of the Tea into Boston Harbor he was
much struck by this incident and said And quite right he was sure

He told Clementina that her friends the Milrays had taken the steamer for
London in the morning He believed they were going to Egypt for the
winter Cairo he said was great fun and he advised Mrs Lander if she
found Florence a bit dull to push on there She asked if it was an easy
place to get to and he assured her that it was very easy from Italy

Mrs Lander was again at home in her world of railroads and hotels but
she confessed after he left them at the next station that she should
have felt more at home if he had been going on to London with them She
philosophized him to the disadvantage of her own countrymen as much less
offish than a great many New York and Boston people He had given her a
good opinion of the whole English nation and the clergyman who had been
so nice to them at Liverpool confirmed her friendly impressions of
England by getting her a small omnibus at the station in London before he
got a cab for himself and his wife and drove away to complete his own
journey on another road She celebrated the omnibus as if it were an
effect of his goodness in her behalf She admired its capacity for
receiving all their trunks and saving the trouble and delay of the
express which always vexed her so much in New York and which had nearly
failed in getting her baggage to the steamer in time

The omnibus remained her chief association with London for she decided
to take the first through train for Italy in the morning She wished to
be settled by which she meant placed in a Florentine hotel for the
winter That lord as she now began and always continued to call
Lioncourt had first given her the name of the best little hotel in
Florence but as it had neither elevator nor furnace heat in it he
agreed in the end that it would not do for her and mentioned the most
modern and expensive house on the Lungarno He told her he did not think
she need telegraph for rooms but she took this precaution before leaving
London and was able to secure them at a price which seemed to her quite
as much as she would have had to pay for the same rooms at a first class
hotel on the Back Bay

The manager had reserved for her one of the best suites which had just
been vacated by a Russian princess I guess you better cable to your
folks where you ah Clementina she said Because if youre satisfied
I am and I presume we shant want to change as long as we stay in
Florence My but its sightly She joined Clementina a moment at the
windows looking upon the Arno and the hills beyond it I guess youll
spend most of your time settin at this winder and I shant blame you

They had arrived late in the dull soft winter afternoon The landlord
led the way himself to their apartment and asked if they would have
fire a facchino came in and kindled roaring blazes on the hearths at
the same time a servant lighted all the candles on the tables and
mantels They both gracefully accepted the fees that Mrs Lander made
Clementina give them the facchino kissed the girls hand My said
Mrs Lander I guess you never had your hand kissed before

The hotel developed advantages which if not those she was used to were
still advantages The halls were warmed by a furnace and she came to
like the little logs burning in her rooms In the care of her own fire
she went back to the simple time of her life in the country and chose to
kindle it herself when it died out with the fagots of broom that blazed
up so briskly

In the first days of her stay she made inquiry for the best American
doctor in Florence and she found him so intelligent that she at once put
her liver in his charge with a history of her diseases and symptoms of
every kind She told him that she was sure that he could have cured Mr
Lander if he had only had him in time she exacted a new prescription
from him for herself and made him order some quinine pills for
Clementina against the event of her feeling debilitated by the air of
Florence




XX

In these first days a letter came to Clementina from Mrs Landers
banker enclosing the introduction which Mrs Milray had promised to her
sisterinlaw It was from Mr Milray as before and it was in Mrs
Milrays handwriting but no message from her came with it To Clementina
it explained itself but she had to explain it to Mrs Lander She had to
tell her of Mrs Milrays behavior after the entertainment on the
steamer and Mrs Lander said that Clementina had done just exactly
right and they both decided against some impulses of curiosity in
Clementinas heart that she should not make use of the introduction

The Hotel des Financieres was mainly frequented by rich Americans full
of ready money and by rich Russians of large credit Better Americans
and worse went like the English to smaller and cheaper hotels and
Clementinas acquaintance was confined to mothers as shy and
ungrammatical as Mrs Lander herself and daughters blankly indifferent
to her Mrs Lander drove out every day when it did not rain and she
took Clementina with her because the doctor said it would do them both
good but otherwise the girl remained pent in their apartment The doctor
found her a teacher and she kept on with her French and began to take
lessons in Italian she spoke with no one but her teacher except when
the doctor came At the table dhote she heard talk of the things that
people seemed to come to Florence for pictures statues palaces famous
places and it made her ashamed of not knowing about them But she could
not go to see these things alone and Mrs Lander in the content she
felt with all her circumstances seemed not to suppose that Clementina
could care for anything but the comfort of the hotel and the doctors
visits When the girl began to get letters from home in answer to the
first she had written back boasting how beautiful Florence was they
assumed that she was very gay and demanded full accounts of her
pleasures Her brother Jim gave something of the village news but he
said he supposed that she would not care for that and she would probably
be too proud to speak to them when she came home The Richlings had
called in to share the family satisfaction in Clementinas first
experiences and Mrs Richling wrote her very sweetly of their happiness
in them She charged her from the rector not to forget any chance of
selfimprovement in the allurements of society but to make the most of
her rare opportunities She said that they had got a guidebook to
Florence with a plan of the city and were following her in the
expeditions they decided she must be making every day they were reading
up the Florentine history in Sismondis Italian Republics and she bade
Clementina be sure and see all the scenes of Savonarolas martyrdom so
that they could talk them over together when she returned

Clementina wondered what Mrs Richling would think if she told her that
all she knew of Florence was what she overheard in the talk of the girls
in the hotel who spoke before her of their dances and afternoon teas
and evenings at the opera and drives in the Cascine and parties to
Fiesole as if she were not by

The days and weeks passed until Carnival was half gone and Mrs Lander
noticed one day that Clementina appeared dull You dont seem to get
much acquainted she suggested

Oh thees plenty of time said Clementina

I wish thee was somebody you could go round with and see the place
Shouldnt you like to see the place Mrs Lander pursued

Theres no hurry about it Mrs Lander It will stay as long as we do

Mrs Lander was thoughtfully silent Then she said I declare Ive got
half a mind to make you send that letta to Miss Milray after all What
difference if Mrs Milray did act so ugly to you He never did and shes
his sista

Oh I dont want to send it Mrs Landa you mustnt ask me to I shall
get along said Clementina The recognition of her forlornness deepened
it but she was cheerfuller for no reason the next morning and that
afternoon the doctor unexpectedly came upon a call which he made haste
to say was not professional

Ive just come from another patient of mine and I promised to ask if
you had not crossed on the same ship with a brother of hersMr
Milray

Celementina and Mrs Lander looked guiltily at each other I guess we
did Mrs Lander owned at last with a reluctant sigh

Then she says you have a letter for her

The doctor spoke to both but his looks confessed that he was not
ignorant of the fact when Mrs Lander admitted Well Clementina hee
has

She wants to know why you havent delivered it the doctor blurted out

Mrs Lander looked at Clementina I guess she hant quite got round to
it yet have you Clementina

The doctor put in Well Miss Milray is rather a dangerous person to
keep waiting If you dont deliver it pretty soon I shouldnt be
surprised if she came to get it Dr Welwright was a young man in the
early thirties with a laugh that a great many ladies said had done more
than any one thing for them and he now prescribed it for Clementina But
it did not seem to help her in the trouble her face betrayed

Mrs Lander took the word Well I wouldnt say it to everybody But
youre our doctor and I guess you wont mind it We dont like the way
Mrs Milray acted to Clementina in the ship and we dont want to be
beholden to any of her folks I dont know as Clementina wants me to tell
you just what it was and I wont but thats the long and shot of it

Im sorry the doctor said Ive never met Mrs Milray but Miss
Milray has such a pleasant house and likes to get young people about
her There are a good many young people in your hotel though and I
suppose you all have a very good time here together He ended by
speaking to Clementina and now he said he had done his errand and must
be going

When he was gone Mrs Lander faltered I dont know but what we made a
mistake Clementina

Its too late to worry about it now said the girl

We hant bound to stay in Florence said Mrs Lander thoughtfully I
only took the rooms by the week and we can go any time Clementina if
you are uncomftable bein here on Miss Milrays account We could go to
Rome they say Romes a nice place or to Egypt

Mrs Milrays in Egypt Clementina suggested

Thats true Mrs Lander admitted with a sigh After a while she went
on I dont know as weve got any right to keep the letter It belongs
to her dont it

I guess it belongs to me as much as it does to her said Clementina
If its to her its for me I am not going to send it Mrs Landa

They were still in this conclusion when early in the following afternoon
Miss Milrays cards were brought up for Mrs Lander and Miss Claxon

Well I declae cried Mrs Lander That docta must have gone
straight and told her what we said

He had no right to said Clementina but neither of them was
displeased and after it was over Mrs Lander said that any one would
have thought the call was for her instead of Clementina from the way
Miss Milray kept talking to her She formed a high opinion of her and
Miss Milray put Clementina in mind of Mr Milray she had the same hair
of chiseled silver and the same smile she moved like him and talked
like him but with a greater liveliness She asked fondly after him and
made Clementina tell her if he seemed quite well and in good spirits
she was civilly interested in Mrs Milrays health At the embarrassment
which showed itself in the girl she laughed and said Dont imagine I
dont know all about it Miss Claxon My sisterinlaw has owned up very
handsomely she isnt half bad as the English say and I think she likes
owning up if she can do it safely

And you dont think asked Mrs Lander that Clementina done wrong to
dance that way

Clementina blushed and Miss Milray laughed again If youll let Miss
Claxon come to a little party Im giving she may do her dance at my
house but she shant be obliged to do it or anything she doesnt like
Dont say she hasnt a gown ready or something of that kind You dont
know the resources of Florence and how the dress makers here doat upon
doing impossible things in no time at all and being ready before they
promise If youll put Miss Claxon in my hands Ill see that shes
dressed for my dance I live out on one of the hills over there that you
see from your windowsshe nodded toward themin a beautiful villa
too cold for winter and too hot for summer but I think Miss Claxon can
endure its discomfort for a day if you can spare her and she will
consent to leave you to the tender mercies of your maid and Miss Milray
paused at the kind of unresponsive blank to which she found herself
talking and put up her lorgnette to glance from Mrs Lander to
Clementina The girl said with embarrassment I dont think I ought to
leave Mrs Landa just now She isnt very well and I shouldnt like to
leave her alone

But were just as much obliged to you as if she could come Mrs Lander
interrupted and later on maybe she can You see we hant got any
maid yit Well we did have one at Woodlake but she made us do so many
things for her that we thought we should like to do a few things for
ouaselves awhile

If Miss Milray perhaps did not conceive the situation exactly she said
Oh they were quite right in that but she might count upon Miss Claxon
for her dance might not she and might not she do anything in her power
for them She rose to go but Mrs Lander took her at her word so far as
to say Why yes if she could tell Clementina the best place to get a
dress she guessed the child would be glad enough to come to the dance

Tell her Miss Milray cried Ill take her Put on your hat my dear
she said to Clementina and come with me now My carriage is at your
door

Clementina looked at Mrs Lander who said Go of couse child I wish
I could go too

Do come too Miss Milray entreated

No no said Mrs Lander flattered I ant feeling very well
today I guess Im better off at home But dont you hurry back on my
account Clementina While the girl was gone to put on her hat she
talked on about her Shes the best gul in the wold and she wont be
one of the poorest and I shall feel that Im doin just what Mr Landa
would have wanted I should He picked her out himself moa than three
yeas ago when we was drivin past her house at Middlemount and it was
to humor him afta he was gone moa than anything else that I took her
Well she want so very easy to git either I can tell you She cut
short her history of the affair to say when Clementina came back I want
you should do the odderin yourself Miss Milray and not let her scrimp
with the money She wants to git some visitin cahds and if you miss
anything about her that shed ought to have or that any otha yong ladys
got wont you just git it for her

As soon as she imagined the case Miss Milray set herself to overcome
Mrs Landers reluctance from a maid She prevailed with her to try the
Italian woman whom she sent her and in a day the genial Maddalena had
effaced the whole tradition of the bleak Ellida It was not essential to
the understanding which instantly established itself between them that
they should have any language in common They babbled at each other Mrs
Lander in her Bostonized Yankee and Maddalena in her gutteral
Florentine and Mrs Lander was flattered to find how well she knew
Italian

Miss Milray had begun being nice to Clementina in fealty to her brother
who so seldom made any proof of her devotion to him and to whom she had
remained passionately true through his shady past She was eager to humor
his whim for the little country girl who had taken his fancy because it
was his whim and not because she had any hopes that Clementina would
justify it She had made Dr Welwright tell her all he knew about her
and his report of her grace and beauty had piqued her curiosity his
account of the forlorn dullness of her life with Mrs Lander in their
hotel had touched her heart But she was still skeptical when she went to
get her letter of introduction when she brought Clementina home from the
dressmakers she asked if she might kiss her and said she was already in
love with her

Her love might have made her wish to do everything for her that she now
began to do but it simplified the situation to account for her to the
world as the ward of Mrs Lander who was as rich as she was vulgar and
it was with Clementina in this character that Miss Milray began to make
the round of afternoon teas and inspired invitations for her at pleasant
houses by giving a young ladies lunch for her at her own Before the
night of her little dance she had lost any misgiving she had felt at
first in the delight of seeing Clementina take the world as if she had
thought it would always behave as amiably as that and as if she had
forgotten her unkind experiences to the contrary She knew from Mrs
Lander how the girls at their hotel had left her out but Miss Milray
could not see that Clementina met them with rancor when her authority
brought them together If the child was humiliated by her past in the
gross lonely luxury of Mrs Landers life or the unconscious poverty of
her own home she did not show it in the presence of the world that now
opened its arms to her She remained so tranquil in the midst of all the
novel differences that it made her friend feel rather vulgar in her
anxieties for her and it was not always enough to find that she had not
gone wrong simply because she had hold still and had the gift of waiting
for things to happen Sometimes when Miss Milray had almost decided that
her passivity was the calm of a savage she betrayed so sweet and
grateful a sense of all that was done for her that her benefactress
decided that she was not rustic but was sylvan in a way of her own and
not so much ignorant as innocent She discovered that she was not
ignorant even of books but with no literary effect from them she had
transmitted her reading into the substance of her native gentleness and
had both ideas and convictions When Clementina most affected her as an
untried wilderness in the conventional things she most felt her equality
to any social fortune that might befall her and then she would have
liked to see her married to a title and taking the glory of this world
with an unconsciousness that experience would never wholly penetrate But
then again she felt that this would be somehow a profanation and she
wanted to pack her up and get her back to Middlemount before anything of
the kind should happen She gave Milray these impressions of Clementina
in the letter she wrote to thank him for her and to scold him for
sending the girl to her She accused him of wishing to get off on her a
riddle which he could not read himself but she owned that the charm of
Clementinas mystery was worth a thousand times the fatigue of trying to
guess her out and that she was more and more infatuated with her every
day

In the meantime Miss Milrays little dance grew upon her till it became
a very large one that filled her villa to overflowing when the time came
for it She lived on one of the fine avenues of the Oltrarno region laid
out in the brief period of prosperity which Florence enjoyed as the
capital of Italy The villa was built at that time and it was much newer
than the house on Seventeenth street in New York where she spent the
girlhood that had since prolonged itself beyond middle life with her She
had first lived abroad in the Paris of the Second Empire and she had
been one winter in Rome but she had settled definitely in Florence
before London became an American colony so that her friends were chiefly
Americans though she had a wide international acquaintance Perhaps her
habit of taking her brothers part when he was a black sheep inclined
her to mercy with people who had not been so blameless in their morals as
they were in their minds and manners She exacted that they should be
interesting and agreeable and not too threadbare but if they had
something that decently buttoned over the frayed places she did not
frown upon their poverty Bohemians of all kinds liked her Philistines
liked her too and in such a place as Florence where the Philistines
themselves are a little Bohemian she might be said to be very popular
You met persons whom you did not quite wish to meet at her house but if
these did not meet you there it was your loss




XI

On the night of the dance the line of private carriages remises and
cabs lined the Viale Ariosto for a mile up and down before her gates
where young artists of both sexes arrived on foot By this time her
passion for Clementina was at its height She had Maddalena bring her out
early in the evening and made her dress under her own eye and her French
maids while Maddalena went back to comfort Mrs Lander

I hated to leave her said Clementina I dont believe shes very
well

Isnt she always ill demanded Miss Milray She embraced the girl
again as if once were not enough Clementina if Mrs Lander wont give
you to me Im going to steal you Do you know what I want you to do
tonight I want you to stand up with me and receive till the dancing
begins as if it were your comingout I mean to introduce everybody to
you Youll be easily the prettiest girl there and youll have the
nicest gown and I dont mean that any of your charms shall be thrown
away You wont be frightened

No I dont believe I shall said Clementina You can tell me what to
do

The dress she wore was of pale green like the light seen in thin woods
out of it shone her white shoulders and her young face as if rising
through the verdurous light The artists to a man and woman wished to
paint her and severally told her so during the evening which lasted
till morning She was not surprised when Lord Lioncourt appeared toward
midnight and astonished Miss Milray by claiming acquaintance with
Clementina He asked about Mrs Lander and whether she had got to
Florence without losing the way he laughed but he seemed really to care
He took Clementina out to supper when the time came and she would have
topped him by half a head as she leaned on his arm if she had not
considerately drooped and trailed a little after him

She could not know what a triumph he was making for her and it was
merely part of the magic of the time that Mr Ewins should come in
presently with one of the ladies He had arrived in Florence that day
and had to be brought unasked He put on the effect of an old friend with
her but Clementinas curiosity was chiefly taken with a tall American
whom she thought very handsome His light yellow hair was brushed smooth
across his forehead like a wellbehaving boys he was dressed like the
other men but he seemed not quite happy in his evening coat and his
gloves which he smote together uneasily from time to time He appeared to
think that somehow the radiant Clementina would know how he felt he did
not dance and he professed to have found himself at the party by a
species of accident He told her that he was out in Europe looking after
a patent right that he had just taken hold of and was having only a
middling good time He pretended surprise to hear her say that she was
having a firstrate time and he tried to reason her out of it He
confessed that from the moment he came into the room he had made up his
mind to take her to supper and had never been so disgusted in his life
as when he saw that little lord toddling off with her and trying to look
as large as life He asked her what a lord was like anyway and he made
her laugh all the time

He told her his name G W Hinkle and asked whether she would be likely
to remember it if they ever met again

Another man who interested her very much was a young Russian with
curling hair and neat small features who spoke better English than she
did and said he was going to be a writer but had not yet decided
whether to write in Russian or French she supposed he had wanted her
advice but he did not wait for it or seem to expect it He was very
much in earnest while he fanned her and his earnestness amused her as
much as the Americans irony He asked which city of America she came
from and when she said none he asked which part of America She
answered New England and he said Oh yes that is where they have the
conscience She did not know what he meant and he put before her the
ideal of New England girlhood which he had evolved from reading American
novels Are you like that he demanded

She laughed and said Not a bit and asked him if he had ever met such
an American girl and he said frankly No the American girls were all
mercenary and cared for nothing but money or marrying titles He added
that he had a title but he would not wear it

Clementina said she did not believe she cared for titles and then he
said But you care for money She denied it but as if she had
confessed it he went on The only American that I have seen with that
conscience was a man I will tell you of him if you wish

He did not wait for her answer It was in Naplesat Pompeii I saw at
the first glance that he was different from other Americans and I
resolved to know him He was there in company with a stupid boy whose
tutor he was and he told me that he was studying to be a minister of the
Protestant church Next year he will go home to be consecrated He
promised to pass through Florence in the spring and he will keep his
word Every act every word every thought of his is regulated by
conscience It is terrible but it is beautiful All the time the
Russian was fanning Clementina with every outward appearance of
flirtation Will you dance again No I should like to draw such a
character as his in a romance




XXII

It was six oclock in the morning before Miss Milray sent Clementina home
in her carriage She would have kept her to breakfast but Clementina
said she ought to go on Mrs Landers account and she wished to go on
her own

She thought she would steal to bed without waking her but she was
stopped by the sound of groans when she entered their apartment the
light gushed from Mrs Landers door Maddalena came out and blessed the
name of her Latin deity so much more familiar and approachable than the
AngloSaxon divinity that Clementina had come at last and poured upon
her the story of a night of suffering for Mrs Lander Through her story
came the sound of Mrs Landers voice plaintively reproachful summoning
Clementina to her bedside Oh how could you go away and leave me Ive
been in such misery the whole night long and the docta didnt do a thing
for me Im puffectly wohn out and I couldnt make my wants known with
that Italian crazyhead If it hadnt been for the portyary comin in and
interpretin when the docta left I dont know what I should have done
I want you should give him a twentyleary note just as quick as you see
him and oh isnt the docta comin

Clementina set about helping Maddalena put the room which was in an
impassioned disorder to rights and she made Mrs Lander a cup of her
own tea which she had brought from S S Pierces in passing through
Boston it was the first thing the sufferer said that had saved her
life Clementina comforted her and promised her that the doctor should
be there very soon and before Mrs Lander fell away to sleep she was so
far out of danger as to be able to ask how Clementina had enjoyed
herself and to be glad that she had such a good time

The doctor would not wake her when he came he said that she had been
through a pretty sharp gastric attack which would not recur if she ate
less of the most unwholesome things she could get and went more into the
air and walked a little He did not seem alarmed and he made Clementina
tell him about the dance which he had been called from to Mrs Landers
bed of pain He joked her for not having missed him in the midst of
their fun she caught herself in the act of yawning and the doctor
laughed and went away

Maddalena had to call her just before dinner when Mrs Lander had been
awake long enough to have sent for the doctor to explain the sort of gone
feeling which she was now the victim of It proved when he came to be
hunger and he prescribed tea and toast and a small bit of steak Before
he came she had wished to arrange for going home at once and dying in
her own country But his opinion so far prevailed with her that she
consented not to telegraph for berths I presume she said itll do
any time before the icebugs begin to run But I d know afta this
Clementina as I can let you leave me quite as you ben doin There was
a lot of flowas come for you this aftanoon but I made Maddalena put em
on the balcony for I dont want you should get poisoned with em in your
sleep I always head they was dangerous in a persons bed room I d
know as they are eitha

Maddalena seemed to know that Mrs Lander was speaking of the flowers
She got them and gave them to Clementina who found they were from some
of the men she had danced with Mr Hinkle had sent a vast bunch of
violets which presently began to give out their sweetness in the warmth
of the room and the odor brought him before her with his yellow hair
scrupulously parted at the side and smoothly brushed showing his
forehead very high up Most of the gentlemen wore their hair parted in
the middle or falling in a fringe over their brows the Russians was
too curly to part and Lord Lioncourt had none except at the sides

She laughed and Mrs Lander said Tell about it Clementina and she
began with Mr Hinkle and kept coming back to him from the others Mrs
Lander wished most to know how that lord had got down to Florence and
Clementina said he was coming to see her

Well I hope to goodness he wont come today I ant fit to see
anybody

Oh I guess he wont come till tomorrow said Clementina she repeated
some of the compliments she had got and she told of all Miss Milrays
kindness to her but Mrs Lander said Well the next time Ill thank
her not to keep you so late She was astonished to hear that Mr Ewins
was there and Any of the nasty things out of the hotel thee she
asked

Yes Clementina said thee wee and some of them wee very nice
They wanted to know if I wouldnt join them and have an aftanoon of our
own here in the hotel so that people could come to us all at once

She went back to the party and described the rest of it When she came
to the part about the Russian she told what he had said of American
girls being fond of money and wanting to marry foreign noblemen

Mrs Lander said Well I hope you ant a going to get married in a
hurry anyway and when you do I hope youll pick out a nice American

Oh yes said Clementina

Mrs Lander had their dinner brought to their apartment She cheered up
and she was in some danger of eating too much but with Clementinas help
she denied herself Their short evening was one of the gayest Clementina
declared she was not the least sleepy but she went to bed at nine and
slept till nine the next day

Mrs Lander the doctor confessed the second morning was more shaken up
by her little attack than he had expected but she decided to see the
gentleman who had asked to call on Clementina Lord Lioncourt did not
come quite so soon as she was afraid he might and when he came he talked
mostly to Clementina He did not get to Mrs Lander until just before he
was going She hospitably asked him what his hurry was and then he said
that he was off for Rome that evening at seven He was nice about hoping
she was comfortable in the hotel and he sympathized with her in her wish
that there was a setbowl in her room she told him that she always tried
to have one and he agreed that it must be very convenient where any one
was as she said sick so much

Mr Hinkle came a day later and then it appeared that he had a mother
whose complaints almost exactly matched Mrs Landers He had her
photograph with him and showed it he said if you had no wife to carry
round a photograph of you had better carry your mothers and Mrs
Lander praised him for being a good son A good son she added always
made a good husband and he said that was just what he told the young
ladies himself but it did not seem to make much impression on them He
kept Clementina laughing and he pretended that he was going to bring a
diagram of his patent right for her to see because she would be
interested in a gleaner like that and he said he wished her father could
see it for it would be sure to interest the kind of man Mrs Lander
described him to be Ill be along up there just about the time you get
home Miss Clementina When did you say it would be

I dont know pretty ealy in the spring I guess

She looked at Mrs Lander who said Well it depends upon how I git up
my health I couldnt bea the voyage now

Mr Hinkle said No best look out for your health if it takes all
summer I shouldnt want you to hurry on my account Your time is my
time All I want is for Miss Clementina here to personally conduct me
to her father If I could get him to take hold of my gleaner in New
England we could make the blueberry crop worth twice what it is

Mrs Lander perceived that he was joking and she asked what he wanted to
run away for when the young Russians card came up He said Oh give
every man a chance and he promised that he would look in every few
days and see how she was getting along He opened the door after he had
gone out and put his head in to say in confidence to Mrs Lander but so
loud that Clementina could hear I suppose shes told you who the belle
of the ball was the other night Went out to supper with a lord He
seemed to think a lord was such a good joke that if you mentioned one you
had to laugh

The Russians card bore the name Baron Belsky with the baron crossed out
in pencil and he began to attack in Mrs Lander the demerits of the
American character as he had divined them He instructed her that her
countrymen existed chiefly to make money that they were more shopkeepers
than the English and worse snobs that their women were trivial and their
men sordid that their ambition was to unite their families with the
European aristocracies and their doctrine of liberty and equality was a
shameless hypocrisy This followed hard upon her asking as she did very
promptly why he had scratched out the title on his card He told her
that he wished to be known solely as an artist and he had to explain to
her that he was not a painter but was going to be a novelist She taxed
him with never having been in America but he contended that as all
America came to Europe he had the materials for a study of the national
character at hand without the trouble of crossing the ocean In return
she told him that she had not been the least seasick during the voyage
and that it was no trouble at all then he abruptly left her and went
over to beg a cup of tea from Clementina who sat behind the kettle by
the window

I have heard this morning from that American I met in Pompeii he began
He is coming northward and I am going down to meet him in Rome

Mrs Lander caught the word and called across the room Why ant that
whee that lods gone

Clementina said yes and while the kettle boiled she asked if Baron
Belsky were going soon

Oh in a week or ten days perhaps I shall know when he arrives Then I
shall go We write to each other every day He drew a letter from his
breast pocket This will give you the idea of his character and he
read If we believe that the hand of God directs all our actions how
can we set up our theories of conduct against what we feel to be his
inspiration

What do you think of that he demanded

I dont believe that God directs our wrong actions said Clementina

How Is there anything outside of God

I dont know whether there is or not But there is something that tempts
me to do wrong sometimes and I dont believe that is God

The Russian seemed struck I will write that to him

No said Clementina I dont want you to say anything about me to
him

No no said Baron Belsky waving his band reassuringly I would not
mention your name

Mr Ewins came in and the Russian said he must go Mrs Lander tried to
detain him too as she had tried to keep Mr Hinkle but he was
inexorable Mr Ewins looked at the door when it had closed upon him
Mrs Lander said That is one of the gentlemen that Clementina met the
otha night at the dance He is a baron but he scratches it out Youd
ought to head him go on about Americans

Yes said Mr Ewins coldly Hes at our hotel and he airs his
peculiar opinions at the table dhote pretty freely Hes a revolutionist
of some kind I fancy He pronounced the epithet with an abhorrence
befitting the citizen of a state born of revolution and a city that had
cradled the revolt Hes a Nihilist I believe

Mrs Lander wished to know what that was and he explained that it was a
Russian who wanted to overthrow the Czar and set up a government of the
people when they were not prepared for liberty

Then maybe he isnt a baron at all said Mrs Lander

Oh I believe he has a right to his title Ewins answered Its a
German one

He said he thought that sort of man was all the more mischievous on
account of his sincerity He instanced a Russian whom a friend of his
knew in Berlin a man of rank like this fellow he got to brooding upon
the condition of working people and that kind of thing till he renounced
his title and fortune and went to work in an iron foundry

Mr Ewins also spoke critically of Mrs Milray He had met her in Egypt
but you soon exhausted the interest of that kind of woman He professed a
great concern that Clementina should see Florence in just the right way
and he offered his services in showing her the place

The Russian came the next day and almost daily after that in the
interest with which Clementinas novel difference from other American
girls seemed to inspire him His imagination had transmuted her simple
Yankee facts into something appreciable to a Slav of his temperament He
conceived of her as the daughter of a peasant whose beauty had charmed
the widow of a rich citizen and who was to inherit the wealth of her
adoptive mother He imagined that the adoption had taken place at a much
earlier period than the time when Clementinas visit to Mrs Lander
actually began and that all which could be done had been done to efface
her real character by indulgence and luxury

His curiosity concerning her childhood her home her father and mother
her brothers and sisters and his misunderstanding of everything she told
him amused her But she liked him and she tried to give him some notion
of the things he wished so much to know It always ended in a
dissatisfaction more or less vehement with the outcome of American
conditions as he conceived them

But you he urged one day you who are a daughter of the fields and
woods why should you forsake that pure life and come to waste yourself
here

Why dont you think its very nice in Florence she asked with eyes
of innocent interest

Nice Nice Do we live for what is nice Is it enough that you have what
you Americans call a nice time

Clementina reflected I wasnt doing much of anything at home and I
thought I might as well come with Mrs Lander if she wanted me so much
She thought in a certain way that he was meddling with what was not his
affair but she believed that he was sincere in his zeal for the ideal
life he wished her to lead and there were some things she had heard
about him that made her pity and respect him his selfexile and his
renunciation of home and country for his principles whatever they were
she did not understand exactly She would not have liked never being able
to go back to Middlemount or to be cut off from all her friends as this
poor young Nihilist was and she said now I didnt expect that it was
going to be anything but a visit and I always supposed we should go back
in the spring but now Mrs Lander is beginning to think she wont be
well enough till fall

And why need you stay with her

Because shes not very well answered Clementina and she smiled a
little triumphantly as well as tolerantly

She could hire nurses and doctors all she wants with her money

I dont believe it would be the same thing exactly and what should I
do if I went back

Do Teach Uplift the lives about you

But you say it is better for people to live simply and not read and
think so much

Then labor in the fields with them

Clementina laughed outright I guess if anyone saw me woking in the
fields they would think I was a disgrace to the neighbahood

Belsky gave her a stupified glare through his spectacles I cannot
undertand you Americans

Well you must come ova to America then Mr Belskyhe had asked her
not to call him by his titleand then you would

No I could not endure the disappointment You have the great
opportunity of the earth You could be equal and just and simple and
kind There is nothing to hinder you But all you try to do is to get
more and more money

Now that isnt faia Mr Belsky and you know it

Well then you joke jokealways joke Like that Mr Hinkle He wants
to make money with his patent of a gleaner that will take the last grain
of wheat from the poor and he wants to jokejoke

Clementina said I wont let you say that about Mr Hinkle You dont
know him or you wouldnt If he jokes why shouldnt he

Belsky made a gesture of rejection Oh you are an American too

She had not grown less American certainly since she had left home even
the little conformities to Europe that she practiced were traits of
Americanism Clementina was not becoming sophisticated but perhaps she
was becoming more conventionalized The knowledge of good and evil in
things that had all seemed indifferently good to her once had crept upon
her and she distinguished in her actions She sinned as little as any
young lady in Florence against the superstitions of society but though
she would not now have done a skirtdance before a shipful of people she
did not afflict herself about her past errors She put on the world but
she wore it simply and in most matters unconsciously Some things were
imparted to her without her asking or wishing and merely in virtue of
her youth and impressionability She took them from her environment
without knowing it and in this way she was coming by an English manner
and an English tone she was only the less American for being rather
English without trying when other Americans tried so hard In the region
of harsh nasals Clementina had never spoken through her nose and she
was now as unaffected in these alien inflections as in the tender cooings
which used to rouse the misgivings of her brother Jim When she was with
English people she employed them involuntarily and when she was with
Americans she measurably lost them so that after half an hour with Mr
Hinkle she had scarcely a trace of them and with Mrs Lander she always
spoke with her native accent

One Sunday night toward the end of Lent Mrs Lander had another of her
attacks she now began to call them so as if she had established an
ownership in them It came on from her cumulative overeating again but
the doctor was not so smiling as he had been with regard to the first
Clementina had got ready to drive out to Miss Milrays for one of her
Sunday teas but she put off her things and prepared to spend the night
at Mrs Landers bedside Well I should think you would want to said
the sufferer Im goin to do everything for you and youd ought to be
willing to give up one of youa junketins for me Im sure I dont know
what you see in em anyway

Oh I am willing Mrs Lander Im glad I hadnt stahted before it
began Clementina busied herself with the pillows under Mrs Landers
dishevelled head and the bedclothes disordered by her throes while Mrs
Lander went on

I dont see whats the use of so much gaddin anyway I dont see as
anything comes of it but just to get a passal of wothless fellas afta
you that think youa going to have money Theres such a thing as two
sides to everything and if the favas is goin to be all on one side I
guess thered betta be a clear undastandin about it I think I got a
right to a little attention as well as them that hant done anything
and if Im goin to be left alone hee to die among strangers every time
one of my attacks comes on

The doctor interposed I dont think youre going to have a very bad
attack this time Mrs Lander

Oh thank you thank you docta But you can undastand cant you how I
shall want to have somebody around that can undastand a little English

The doctor said Oh yes And Miss Claxon and I can understand a good
deal between us and were going to stay and see how a little morphine
behaves with you

Mrs Lander protested Oh I cant bea mophine docta

Did you ever try it he asked preparing his little instrument to
imbibe the solution

No but Mr Landa did and it most killed him it made him sick

Well youre about as sick as you can be now Mrs Lander and if you
dont die of this pinprickhe pushed the needlepoint under the skin
of her massive forearmI guess youll live through it

She shrieked but as the pain began to abate she gathered courage and
broke forth joyfully Why its beautiful ant it I declare it woks
like a cham Well I shall always keep mophine around after this and
when I feel one of these attacks comin on

Send for a physician Mrs Lander said Dr Welwright and hell know
what to do

I ant so sure of that returned Mrs Lander fondly He would if you
was the one I declare I believe I could get up and walk right off I
feel so well

Thats good If youll take a walk day after tomorrow it will help you a
great deal more

Well I shall always say that youve saved my life this time doctor
and Clementina shes stood by nobly Ill say that for her She twisted
her big head round on the pillow to get sight of the girl Im all
right now and dont you mind what I said Its just my misery talkin
I dont know what I did say I felt so bad But Im fustrate now and I
believe I could drop off to sleep this minute Why dont you go to your
tea You can just as well as not

Oh I dont want to go now Mrs Lander Id ratha stay

But there ant any more danger now is thee docta Mrs Lander
appealed

No There wasnt any danger before But when youre quite yourself I
want to have a little talk with you Mrs Lander about your diet We
must look after that

Why docta thats what I do do now I eat all the healthy things I lay
my hands on dont I Clementina And hant you always at me about it

Clementina did not answer and the doctor laughed Well I should like to
know what more I could do

Perhaps you could do less Well see about that Better go to sleep
now if you feel like it

Well I will if youll make this silly child go to her tea I spose
she wont because I scolded her Shes an awful hand to lay anything up
against you You know you ah Clementina But I can say this doctor a
betta child dont breathe and I just couldnt live without her Come
hee Clementina I want to kiss you once before I go to sleep sos to
make sua you dont bea malice She pulled Clementina down to kiss her
and babbled on affectionately and optimistically till her talk became
the voice of her dreams and then ceased altogether

You could go perfectly well Miss Claxon said the doctor

No I dont cae to go answered Clementina Id ratha stay If she
should wake

She wont wake until long after youve got back Ill answer for that
Im going to stay here awhile Go Ill take the responsibility

Clementinas face brightened She wanted very much to go She should meet
some pleasant people she always did at Miss Milrays Then the light
died out of her gay eyes and she set her lips No I told her I
shouldnt go

I didnt hear you said Dr Welwright A doctor has no eyes and ears
except for the symptoms of his patients

Oh I know said Clementina She had liked Dr Welwright from the
first and she thought it was very nice of him to stay on after he left
Mrs Landers bedside and help to make her lonesome evening pass
pleasantly in the parlor He jumped up finally and looked at his watch
Bless my soul he said and he went in for another look at Mrs Lander
When he came back he said Shes all right But youve made me break an
engagement Miss Claxon I was going to tea at Miss Milrays She
promised me I should meet you there

It seemed a great joke and Clementina offered to carry his excuses to
Miss Milray when she went to make her own

She went the next morning Mrs Lander insisted that she should go she
said that she was not going to have Miss Milray thinking that she wanted
to keep her all to herself

Miss Milray kissed the girl in full forgiveness but she asked Did Dr
Welwright think it a very bad attack

Has he been hea returned Clementina

Miss Milray laughed Doctors dont betray their patientsgood doctors
No he hasnt been here if that will help you I wish it would help me
but it wont quite I dont like to think of that old woman using you
up Clementina

Oh she doesnt Miss Milray You mustnt think so You dont know how
good she is to me

Does she ever remind you of it

Clementinas eyes fell She isnt like herself when she doesnt feel
well

I knew it Miss Milray triumphed I always knew that she was a
dreadful old tabby I wish you were safely out of her clutches Come and
live with me my dear when Mrs Lander gets tired of you But shell
never get tired of you Youre just the kind of helpless mouse that such
an old tabby would make her natural prey But she shant even if
another sort of cat has to get you Im sorry you couldnt come last
night Your little Russian was here and went away early and very
bitterly because you didnt come He seemed to think there was nobody
and said so in everything but words

Oh said Clementina Dont you think hes very nice Miss Milray

Hes very mystical or else so very simple that he seems so I hope you
can make him out

Dont you think hes very much in eanest

Oh as the grave or the asylum I shouldnt like him to be in earnest
about me if I were you

But thats just what he is Clementina told how the Russian had
lectured her and wished her to go back to the country and work in the
fields

Oh if thats all cried Miss Milray I was afraid it was another kind
of earnestness the kind I shouldnt like if I were you

Theres no danger of that I guess Clementina laughed and Miss Milray
went on

Another of your admirers was here but he was not so inconsolable or
else he found consolation in staying on and talking about you or
joking

Oh yes Mr Hinkle cried Clementina with the smile that the thought
of him always brought Hes lovely

Lovely Well I dont know why it isnt the word It suits him a great
deal better than some insipid girls that people give it to Yes I could
really fall in love with Mr Hinkle Hes the only man I ever saw who
would know how to break the fall

It was lunchtime before their talk had begun to run low and it swelled
again over the meal Miss Milray returned to Mrs Lander and she made
Clementina confess that she was a little trying sometimes But she
insisted that she was always good and in remorse she went away as soon
as Miss Milray rose from table

She found Mrs Lander very much better and willing to have had her stay
the whole afternoon with Miss Milray I dont want she should have
anything to say against me to you Clementina shed be glad enough to
But I guess its just as well youa back That scratchedout baron has
been hee twice and hes waitin for you in the pahla now I presume
hell keep comin till you do see him I guess you betta have it ova
whatever it is

I guess youre right Mrs Lander

Clementina found the Russian walking up and down the room and as soon as
their greeting was over he asked leave to continue his promenade but he
stopped abruptly before her when she had sunk upon a sofa

I have come to tell you a strange story he said

It is the story of that American friend of mine I tell it to you
because I think you can understand and will know what to advise what to
do

He turned upon his heel and walked the length of the room and back
before he spoke again

Since several years he said growing a little less idiomatic in his
English as his excitement mounted he met a young girl a child when he
was still not a mans full age It was in the country in the mountains
of America andhe loved her Both were very poor he a student
earning the means to complete his education in the university He had
dedicated himself to his church and with the temperament of the
Puritans he forbade himself all thoughts of love But he was of a
passionate and impulsive nature and in a moment of abandon he confessed
his love The child was bewildered frightened she shrank from his
avowal and he filled with remorse for his selfbetrayal bade her let
it be as if it had not been he bade her think of him no more

Clementina sat as if powerless to move staring at Belsky He paused in
his walk and allowed an impressive silence to ensue upon his words

Time passed days months years and he did not see her again He
pursued his studies in the university at their completion he entered
upon the course of divinity and he is soon to be a minister of his
church In all that time the image of the young girl has remained in his
heart and has held him true to the only love he has ever known He will
know no other while he lives

Again he stopped in front of Clementina she looked helplessly up at him
and he resumed his walk

He with his dreams of renunciation of abnegation had thought some day
to return to her and ask her to be his He believed her capable of equal
sacrifice with himself and he hoped to win her not for himself alone
but for the religion which he put before himself He would have invited
her to join her fate with his that they might go together on some mission
to the paganin the South Seas in the heart of Africa in the jungle of
India He had always thought of her as gay but good unworldly in soul
and exalted in spirit She has remained with him a vision of angelic
loveliness as he had seen her last in the moonlight on the banks of a
mountain torrent But he believes that he has disgraced himself before
her that the very scruple for her youth her ignorance which made him
entreat her to forget him must have made her doubt and despise him He
has never had the courage to write to her one word since all those years
but he maintains himself bound to her forever He stopped short before
Clementina and seized her hands If you knew such a girl what would you
have her do Should she bid him hope again Would you have her say to him
that she too had been faithful to their dream and that she too

Let me go Mr Belsky let me go I say Clementina wrenched her hands
from him and ran out of the room Belsky hesitated then he found his
hat and after a glance at his face in the mirror left the house

The tide of travel began to set northward in April Many English many
Americans appeared in Florence from Naples and Rome many who had
wintered in Florence went on to Venice and the towns of northern Italy
on their way to Switzerland and France and Germany

The spring was cold and rainy and the irresolute Italian railroads were
interrupted by the floods A tawny deluge rolled down from the mountains
through the bed of the Arno and kept the Florentine firedepartment on
the alert night and day It is a curious thing about this country said
Mr Hinkle encountering Baron Belsky on the Ponte Trinita that the
only thing they ever have here for a fire company to put out is a
freshet If they had a real conflagration once I reckon they would want
to bring their lifepreservers

The Russian was looking down over the parapet at the boiling river He
lifted his head as if he had not heard the American and stared at him a
moment before he spoke It is said that the railway to Rome is broken at
Grossetto

Well Im not going to Rome said Hinkle easily Are you

I was to meet a friend there but he wrote to me that he was starting to
Florence and now

Hes resting on the way Well hell get here about as quick as he would
in the ordinary course of travel One good thing about Italy is you
dont want to hurry if you did youd get left

Belsky stared at him in the stupefaction to which the American humor
commonly reduced him If he gets left on the Grossetto line he can go
back and come up by Orvieto no

He can if he isnt in a hurry Hinkle assented

Its a good way if youve got time to burn

Belsky did not attempt to explore the Americans meaning Do you know
he asked whether Mrs Lander and her young friend are still in
Florence

I guess they are

It was said they were going to Venice for the summer

Thats what the doctor advised for the old lady But they dont start
for a week or two yet

Oh

Are you going to Miss Milrays Sunday night Last of the season I
believe

Belsky seemed to recall himself from a distance

Nono he said and he moved away forgetful of the ceremonious
salutation which he commonly used at meeting and parting Hinkle looked
after him with the impression people have of a difference in the
appearance and behavior of some one whose appearance and behavior do not
particularly concern them

The day that followed Belsky haunted the hotel where Gregory was to
arrive with his pupil and where the pupils family were waiting for
them That night long after their belated train was due they came the
pupil was with his father and mother and Gregory was alone when Belsky
asked for him the fourth or fifth time

You are not well he said as they shook hands You are fevered

Im tired said Gregory Weve bad a bad time getting through

I come inconveniently You have not dined perhaps

Yes Yes Ive had dinner Sit down How have you been yourself

Oh always well Belsky sat down and the friends stared at each other
I have strange news for you

For me

You She is here

She

Yes The young girl of whom you told me If I had not forbidden myself by
my loyalty to youif I had not said to myself every moment in her
presence No it is for your friend alone that she is beautiful and
goodBut you will have nothing to reproach me in that regard

What do you mean demanded Gregory

I mean that Miss Claxon is in Florence with her protectress the rich
Mrs Lander The most admired young lady in society going everywhere
and everywhere courted and welcomed the favorite of the fashionable Miss
Milray But why should this surprise you

You said nothing about it in your letters You

I was not sure it was she you never told me her name When I had
divined the fact I was so soon to see you that I thought best to keep
it till we met

Gregory tried to speak but he let Belsky go on

If you think that the world has spoiled her that she will be different
from what she was in her home among your mountains let me reassure you
In her you will find the miracle of a woman whom no flattery can turn the
head I have watched her in your interest I have tested her She is what
you saw her last

Surely asked Gregory in an anguish for what he now dreaded you
havent spoken to her of me

Not by name no I could not have that indiscretion

The name is nothing Have you said that you knew meOf course not But
have you hinted at any knowledgeBecause

You will hear said Belsky and he poured out upon Gregory the story of
what he had done She did not deny anything She was greatly moved but
she did not refuse to let me bid you hope

Oh Gregory took his head between his hands You have spoiled my
life

Spoiled Belsky stopped aghast

I told you my story in a moment of despicable weaknessof impulsive
folly But how could I dream that you would ever meet her How could I
imagine that you would speak to her as you have done He groaned and
began to creep giddily about the room in his misery Oh oh oh What
shall I do

But I do not understand Belsky began If I have committed an error

Oh an error that never could be put right in all eternity

Then let me go to herlet me tell her

Keep away from her shouted Gregory Do you hear Never go near her
again

Gregory

Ah I beg your pardon I dont know what Im doingsaying What will she
thinkwhat will she think of me He had ceased to speak to Belsky he
collapsed into a chair and hid his face in his arms stretched out on the
table before him

Belsky watched him in the stupefaction which the artistic nature feels
when life proves sentient under its hand and not the mere material of
situations and effects He could not conceive the full measure of the
disaster he had wrought the outrage of his own behavior had been lost to
him in his preoccupation with the romantic end to be accomplished He had
meant to be the friend the prophet to these American lovers whom he
was reconciling and interpreting to each other but in some point he must
have misunderstood Yet the error was not inexpiable and in his
expiation he could put the seal to his devotion He left the room where
Gregory made no effort to keep him

He walked down the street from the hotel to the Arno and in a few
moments he stood on the bridge where he had talked with that joker in
the morning as they looked down together on the boiling river He had a
strange wish that the joker might have been with him again to learn that
there were some things which could not be joked away

The night was blustering and the wind that blew the ragged clouds across
the face of the moon swooped in sudden gusts upon the bridge and the
deluge rolling under it and hoarsely washing against its piers Belsky
leaned over the parapet and looked down into the eddies and currents as
the fitful light revealed them He had a fantastic pleasure in studying
them and choosing the moment when he should leap the parapet and be lost
in them The incident could not be used in any novel of his and no one
else could do such perfect justice to the situation but perhaps
afterwards when the facts leading to his death should be known through
the remorse of the lovers whom he had sought to serve some other
artistnature could distil their subtlest meaning in a memoir delicate as
the aroma of a faded flower

He was willing to make this sacrifice too and he stepped back a pace
from the parapet when the fitful blast caught his hat from his head and
whirled it along the bridge The whole current of his purpose changed
and as if it had been impossible to drown himself in his bare head he
set out in chase of his hat which rolled and gamboled away and escaped
from his clutch whenever he stooped for it till a final whiff of wind
flung it up and tossed it over the bridge into the river where he
helplessly watched it floating down the flood till it was carried out of
sight

Gregory did not sleep and he did not find peace in the prayers he put up
for guidance He tried to think of some one with whom he might take
counsel but he knew no one in Florence except the parents of his pupil
and they were impossible He felt himself abandoned to the impulse which
he dreaded in going to Clementina and he went without hope willing to
suffer whatever penalty she should visit upon him after he had disavowed
Belskys action and claimed the responsibility for it

He was prepared for her refusal to see him he had imagined her wounded
and pathetic he had fancied her insulted and indignant but she met him
eagerly and with a mystifying appeal in her welcome He began at once
without attempting to bridge the time since they had met with any
formalities

I have come to speak to you aboutthatRussian about Baron Belsky

Yes yes she returned anxiously Then you have head

He came to me last night andI want to say that I feel myself to blame
for what he has done

You

Yes I I never spoke of you by name to him I didnt dream of his ever
seeing you or that he would dare to speak to you of what I told him But
I believe he meant no wrong and it was I who did the harm whether I
authorized it or not

Yes yes she returned with the effect of putting his words aside as
something of no moment Have they head anything more

How anything more he returned in a daze

Then dont you know About his falling into the river I know he didnt
drown himself

Gregory shook his head Whenwhat makes them thinkHe stopped and
stared at her

Why they know that he went down to the Ponte Trinity last night
somebody saw him going And then that peasant found his hat with his name
in it in the driftwood below the Cascine

Yes said Gregory lifelessly He let his arms drop forward and his
helpless hands hang over his knees his gaze fell from her face to the
floor

Neither spoke for a time that seemed long and then it was Clementina who
spoke But it isnt true

Oh yes it is said Gregory as before

Mr Hinkle doesnt believe it is she urged

Mr Hinkle

Hes an American whos staying in Florence He came this moning to tell
me about it Even if hes drowned Mr Hinkle believes he didnt mean to
he must have just fallen in

What does it matter demanded Gregory lifting his heavy eyes Whether
he meant it or not I caused it I drove him to it

You drove him

Yes He told me what he had said to you and Isaid that he had spoiled
my lifeI dont know

Well he had no right to do it but I didnt blame you Clementina
began compassionately

Its too late It cant be helped now Gregory turned from the mercy
that could no longer save him He rose dizzily and tried to get himself
away

You mustnt go she interposed I dont believe you made him do it
Mr Hinkle will be back soon and he will

If he should bring word that it was true Gregory asked

Well said Clementina then we should have to bear it

A sense of something finer than the surface meaning of her words pierced
his morbid egotism Im ashamed he said Will you let me stay

Why yes you must she said and if there was any censure of him at
the bottom of her heart she kept it there and tried to talk him away
from his remorse which was in his temperament perhaps rather than his
conscience she made the time pass till there came a knock at the door
and she opened it to Hinkle

I didnt send up my name I thought I wouldnt stand upon ceremony just
now he said

Oh no she returned Mr Hinkle this is Mr Gregory Mr Gregory
knew Mr Belsky and he thinks

She turned to Gregory for prompting and he managed to say I dont
believe he was quite the sort of person toAnd yet he mighthe was in
trouble

Money trouble asked Hinkle They say these Russians have a perfect
genius for debt I had a little inspiration since I saw you but there
doesnt seems to be anything in it so far He addressed himself to
Clementina but he included Gregory in what he said It struck me that
he might have been running his board and had used this drowning episode
as a blind But Ive been around to his hotel and hes settled up all
fair and square enough The landlord tried to think of something he
hadnt paid but he couldnt and I never saw a man try harder either
Clementina smiled she put her hand to her mouth to keep from laughing
but Gregory frowned his distress in the untimely droning

I dont give up my theory that its a fake of some kind though He
could leave behind a good many creditors besides his landlord The
authorities have sealed up his effects and theyve done everything but
call out the fire department thats on duty looking after the freshet
and it couldnt be spared Ill go out now and slop round a little more
in the cause Hinkle looked down at his shoes and his drabbled trousers
and wiped the perspiration from his face but I thought Id drop in and
tell you not to worry about it Miss Clementina I would stake anything
you pleased on Mr Belskys safety Mr Gregory here looks like he
would be willing to take odds he suggested

Gregory commanded himself from his misery to say I wish I could
believeI mean

Of course we dont want to think that the mans a fraud any more than
that hes dead Perhaps we might hit upon some middle course At any
rate its worth trying

May Ido you object to my joining you Gregory asked

Why come Hinkle hospitably assented Glad to have you Ill be back
again Miss Clementina

Gregory was going away without any form of leavetaking but he turned
back to ask Will you let me come back too

Why suttainly Mr Gregory said Clementina and she went to find Mrs
Lander whom she found in bed

I thought Id lay down she explained I dont believe Im goin to be
sick but its one of my pooa days and I might just as well be in bed as
not Clementina agreed with her and Mrs Lander asked You head
anything moa

No Mr Hinkle has just been hea but he hadnt any news

Mrs Lander turned her face toward the wall Next thing hell be
drownin himself I neva wanted you should have anything to do with the
fellas that go to that womans There aint any of em to be depended
on

It was the first time that her growing jealousy of Miss Milray had openly
declared itself but Clementina had felt it before without knowing how
to meet it As an escape from it now she was almost willing to say Mrs
Lander I want to tell you that Mr Gregory has just been hea too

Mr Gregory

Yes Dont you remember At the Middlemount The first summa He was the
headwaitathat student

Mrs Lander jerked her head round on the pillow Well of all theWhat
does he want over hea

Nothing That ishes travelling with a pupil that hes preparing for
college andhe came to see us

Dyou tell him I couldnt see him

Yes

I guess hed think I was a pretty changed pusson Now I want you should
stay with me Clementina and if anybody else comes

Maddalena entered the room with a card which she gave to the girl

Who is it Mrs Lander demanded

Miss Milray

Of couse Well you may just send wod that you cantOr no you
must Shed have it all ova the place by night that I wouldnt let you
see her But dont you make any excuse for me If she asks after me
dont you say Im sick You say Im not at home

Ive come about that little wretch Miss Milray began after kissing
Clementina I didnt know but you had heard something I hadnt or I had
heard something you hadnt You know I belong to the Hinkle persuasion I
think Belskys run his boardas Mr Hinkle calls it

Clementina explained how this part of the Hinkle theory had failed and
then Miss Milray devolved upon the belief that he had run his tailors
bill or his shoemakers They are delightful those Russians but
theyre born insolvent I dont believe hes drowned himself How she
broke off to ask in a burlesque whisper istheoldtabby She
laughed for answer to her own question and then with another sudden
diversion she demanded of a look in Clementinas face which would not be
laughed away Well my dear what is it

Miss Milray said the girl should you think me very silly if I told
you somethingsilly

Not in the least cried Miss Milray joyously Its the final proof of
your wisdom that Ive been waiting for

Its because Mr Belsky is all mixed up in it said Clementina as if
some excuse were necessary and then she told the story of her love
affair with Gregory Miss Milray punctuated the several facts with vivid
nods but at the end she did not ask her anything and the girl somehow
felt the freer to add I believe I will tell you his name It is Mr
GregoryFrank Gregory

And hes been in Egypt

Yes the whole winta

Then hes the one that my sisterinlaw has been writing me about

Oh did he meet her thea

I should think so And hell meet her here very soon Shes coming
with my poor brother I meant to tell you but this ridiculous Belsky
business drove it out of my head

And do you think Clementina entreated that he was to blame

Why I dont believe hes done it you know

Oh I didnt mean Mr Belsky I meantMr Gregory For telling Mr
Belsky

Certainly not Men always tell those things to some one I suppose
Nobody was to blame but Belsky for his meddling

Miss Milray rose and shook out her plumes for flight as if she were
rather eager for flight but at the little sigh with which Clementina
said Yes that is what I thought she faltered

I was going to run away for I shouldnt like to mix myself up in your
affairits certainly a very strange oneunless I was sure I could help
you But if you think I can

Clementina shook her head I dont believe you can she said with a
candor so wistful that Miss Milray stopped quite short How does Mr
Gregory take this Belsky business she asked

I guess he feels it moa than I do said the girl

He shows his feeling more

YesnoHe believes he drove him to it

Miss Milray took her hand for parting but did not kiss her I wont
advise you my dear In fact you havent asked me to Youll know what
to do if you havent done it already girls usually have when they want
advice Was there something you were going to say

Oh no Nothing Do you think she hesitated appealingly do you
think we areengaged

If hes anything of a man at all he must think he is

Yes said Clementina wistfully I guess he does

Miss Milray looked sharply at her And does he think you are

I dont knowhe didnt say

Well said Miss Milray rather dryly then its something for you to
think over pretty carefully




XXVI

Hinkle came back in the afternoon to make a hopeful report of his failure
to learn anything more of Belsky but Gregory did not come with him He
came the next morning long before Clementina expected visitors and he
was walking nervously up and down the room when she appeared As if he
could not speak he held toward her without speaking a telegram in
English dated that day in Rome

 Deny report of my death Have written

 Belsky

She looked up at Gregory from the paper when she had read it with
joyful eyes Oh I am so glad for you I am so glad he is alive

He took the dispatch from her hand I brought it to you as soon as it
came

Yes yes Of couse

I must go now and do what he saysI dont know how yet He stopped
and then went on from a different impulse Clementina it isnt a
question now of that wretchs life and death and I wish I need never
speak of him again But what he told you was true He looked steadfastly
at her and she realized how handsome he was and how well dressed His
thick red hair seemed to have grown darker above his forehead his
moustache was heavier and it curved in at the corners of his mouth he
bore himself with a sort of selfdisdain that enhanced his splendor I
have never changed toward you I dont say it to make favor with you I
dont expect to do that now but it is true That night there at
Middlemount I tried to take back what I said because I believed that I
ought

Oh yes I knew that said Clementina in the pause he made

We were both too young I had no prospect in life I saw the instant
after I had spoken that I had no right to let you promise anything I
tried to forget you I couldnt I tried to make you forget me He
faltered and she did not speak but her head drooped a little I wont
ask how far I succeeded I always hoped that the time would come when I
could speak to you again When I heard from Fane that you were at
Woodlake I wished to come out and see you but I hadnt the courage I
hadnt the right Ive had to come to you without either now Did he
speak to you about me

I thought he was beginning to once but he neva did

It didnt matter it could only have made bad worse It cant help me to
say that somehow I was wishing and trying to do what was right but I
was

Oh I know that Mr Gregory said Clementina generously

Then you didnt doubt me in spite of all

I thought you would know what to do No I didnt doubt you exactly

I didnt deserve your trust he cried How came that man to mention
me he demanded abruptly after a moments silence

Mr Belsky It was the first night I saw him and we were talking about
Americans and he began to tell me about an American friend of his who
was very conscientious I thought it must be you the fust moment said
Clementina smiling with an impersonal pleasure in the fact

From the conscientiousness he asked in bitter selfirony

Why yes she returned simply That was what made me think of you
And the last time when he began to talk about you I couldnt stop him
although I knew he had no right to

He had no right But I gave him the power to do it He meant no harm
but I enabled him to do all the harm

Oh if hes only alive now there is no harm

He looked into her eyes with a misgiving from which he burst impetuously
Then you do care for me still after all that I have done to make you
detest me He started toward her but she shrank back

I didnt mean that she hesitated

You know that I love youthat I have always loved you

Yes she assented But you might be sorry again that you had said it
It sounded like coquetry but he knew it was not coquetry

Never Ive wished to say it again ever since that night at
Middlemount I have always felt bound by what I said then though I took
back my words for your sake But the promise was always there and my
life was in it You believe that

Why I always believed what you said Mr Gregory

Well

Clementina paused with her head seriously on one side I should want to
think about it before I said anything

You are right he submitted dropping his outstretched arms to his
side I have been thinking only of myself as usual

No she protested compassionately But doesnt it seem as if we ought
to be sua this time I did cae for you then but I was very young and
I dont know yetI thought I had always felt just as you did but
nowDont you think we had both betta wait a little while till we ah
moa suttain

They stood looking at each other and he said with a kind of passionate
selfdenial Yes think it over for me too I will come back if you
will let me

Oh thank you she cried after him gratefully as if his forbearance
were the greatest favor

When he was gone she tried to release herself from the kind of abeyance
in which she seemed to have gone back and been as subject to him as in
the first days when he had awed her and charmed her with his superiority
at Middlemount and he again older and freer as she had grown since

He came back late in the afternoon looking jaded and distraught Hinkle
who looked neither was with him Well he began this is the greatest
thing in my experience Belskys not only alive and well but Mr Gregory
and I are both at large I did think one time that the police would
take us into custody on account of our morbid interest in the thing and
I dont believe we should have got off if the Consul hadnt gone bail
for us so to speak I thought we had better take the Consul in on our
way and it was lucky we did

Clementina did not understand all the implications but she was willing
to take Mr Hinkles fun on trust I dont believe youll convince Mrs
Landa that Mr Belskys alive and well till you bring him back to say
so

Is that so said Hinkle Well we must have him brought back by the
authorities then Perhaps theyll bring him anyway They cant try him
for suicide but as I understand the police here a man cant lose his
hat over a bridge in Florence with impunity especially in a time of high
water Anyway theyre identifying Belsky by due process of law in Rome
now and I guess Mr Gregoryhe nodded toward Gregory who sat silent
and absent will be kept under surveillance till the whole mystery is
cleared up

Clementina responded gayly still but with less and less sincerity and
she let Hinkle go at last with the feeling that he knew she wished him to
go He made a brave show of not seeing this and when he was gone she
remembered that she had not thanked him for the trouble he had taken on
her account and her heart ached after him with a sense of his sweetness
and goodness which she had felt from the first through his quaint
drolling It was as if the door which closed upon him shut her out of the
life she had been living of late and into the life of the past where she
was subject again to the spell of Gregorys mood it was hardly his will

He began at once I wished to make you say something this morning that I
have no right to hear you say yet and I have been trying ever since to
think how I could ask you whether you could share my life with me and
yet not ask you to do it But I cant do anything without knowingYou
may not care for what my life is to be at all

Clementinas head drooped a little but she answered distinctly I do
cae Mr Gregory

Thank you for that much I dont count upon more than you have said
Clementina I am going to be a missionary I think I shall ask to be sent
to China Ive not decided yet My life will be hard it will be full of
danger and privation it will be exile You will have to think of sharing
such a life if you think

He stopped the time had come for her to speak and she said I knew you
wanted to be a missionary

Andandyou would go with me You wouldHe started toward her and
she did not shrink from him now but he checked himself But you
mustnt you know for my sake

I dont believe I quite undastand she faltered

You must not do it for me but for what makes me do it Without that our
life our work could have no consecration

She gazed at him in patient faintly smiling bewilderment as if it were
something he would unriddle for her when he chose

We mustnt err in this it would be worse than error it would be sin
He took a turn about the room and then stopped before her Will
youwill you join me in a prayer for guidance Clementina

II dont know she hesitated I will butdo you think I had
betta

He began Why surelyAfter a moment he asked gravely You believe
that our actions will be guided aright if we seek help

Oh yesyes

And that if we do not we shall stumble in our ignorance

I dont know I never thought of that

Never thought of it

We never did it in our family Father always said that if we really
wanted to do right we could find the way Gregory looked daunted and
then he frowned darkly Are you provoked with me Do you think what I
have said is wrong

No no You must say what you believe It would be double hypocrisy in
me if I prevented you

But I would do it if you wanted me to she said

Oh for me for ME he protested I will try to tell you what I mean
and why you must not for that very reason But he had to speak of
himself of the miracle of finding her again by the means which should
have lost her to him forever and of the significance of this Then it
appeared to him that he could not reject such a leading without error
without sin Such a thing could not have merely happened

It seemed so to Clementina too she eagerly consented that this was
something they must think of as well But the light waned the dark
thickened in the room before he left her to do so Then he said
fervently We must not doubt that everything will come right and his
words seemed an effect of inspiration to them both




XXVII

After Gregory was gone a misgiving began in Clementinas mind which grew
more distinct through all the difficulties of accounting to Mrs Lander
for his long stay The girl could see that it was with an obscure
jealousy that she pushed her questions and said at last That Mr
Hinkle is about the best of the lot Hes the only one thats eva had the
mannas to ask after me except that lod He did

Clementina could not pretend that Gregory had asked but she could not
blame him for a forgetfulness of Mrs Lander which she had shared with
him This helped somehow to deepen the misgiving which followed her from
Mrs Landers bed to her own and haunted her far into the night She
could escape from it only by promising herself to deal with it the first
thing in the morning She did this in terms much briefer than she thought
she could have commanded She supposed she would have to write a very
long letter but she came to the end of all she need say in a very few
lines

 DEAR MR GREGORY

 I have been thinking about what you said yesterday and I have to
 tell you something Then you can do what is right for both of us
 you will know better than I can But I want you to understand that
 if I go with you in your missionary life I shall do it for you and
 not for anything else I would go anywhere and live anyhow for you
 but it would be for you I do not believe that I am religious and I
 know that I should not do it for religion

 That is all but I could not get any peace till I let you know just
 how I felt

 CLEMENTINA CLAXON

The letter went early in the morning though not so early but it was put
in Gregorys hand as he was leaving his hotel to go to Mrs Landers He
tore it open and read it on the way and for the first moment it seemed
as if it were Providence leading him that he might lighten Clementinas
heart of its doubts with the least delay He had reasoned that if she
would share for his sake the life that he should live for righteousness
sake they would be equally blest in it and it would be equally
consecrated in both But this luminous conclusion faded in his thought as
he hurried on and he found himself in her presence with something like a
hope that she would be inspired to help him

His soul lifted at the sound of the gay voice in which she asked Did
you get my letta and it seemed for the instant as if there could be no
trouble that their love could not overcome

Yes he said and he put his arms around her but with a provisionality
in his embrace which she subtly perceived

And what did you think of it she asked Did you think I was silly

He was aware that she had trusted him to do away her misgiving No no
he answered guiltily Wiser than I am always II want to talk with
you about it Clementina I want you to advise me

He felt her shrink from him and with a pang he opened his arms to free
her But it was right he must She had been expecting him to say that
there was nothing in her misgiving and he could not say it

Clementina he entreated why do you think you are not religious

Why I have never belonged to chuch she answered simply He looked so
daunted that she tried to soften the blow after she had dealt it Of
course I always went to chuch though father and motha didnt I went
to the Episcopalto Mr Richlings But I neva was confirmed

Butyou believe in God

Why certainly

And in the Bible

Why of couse

And that it is our duty to bear the truth to those who have never heard
of it

I know that is the way you feel about it but I am not certain that I
should feel so myself if you didnt want me to Thats what I got to
thinking about last night She added hopefully But perhaps it isnt so
great a thing as I

Its a very great thing he said and from standing in front of her he
now sat down beyond a little table before her sofa How can I ask you to
share my life if you dont share my faith

Why I should try to believe everything that you do of couse

Because I do

Wellyes

You wring my heart Are you willing to studyto look into these
questionstotoIt all seemed very hopeless very absurd but she
answered seriously

Yes but I believe it would all come back to just where it is now

What you say Clementina makes me so happy but it ought to make
memiserable And you would do all this be all this for me a wretched
and erring creature of the dust and yet not do it forGod

Clementina could only say Perhaps if He meant me to do it for Him He
would have made me want to He made you

Yes said Gregory and for a long time he could not say any more He
sat with his elbow on the table and his head against his lifted hand

You see she began gently I got to thinking that even if I eva came
to believe what you wanted me to I should be doing it after all because
you wanted me to

Yes yes he answered desolately There is no way out of it If you
only hated me Clementina despised meI dont mean that But if you
were not so good I could have a more hope for youfor myself Its
because you are so good that I cant make myself wish to change you and
yet I knowI am afraid that if you told me my life and objects were
wrong I should turn from them and be whatever you said Do you tell me
that

No indeed cried Clementina with abhorrence Then I should despise
you

He seemed not to heed her He moved his lips as if he were talking to
himself and he pleaded What shall we do

We must try to think it out and if we cantif you cant let me give
up to you unless I do it for the same reason that you do and if I cant
let you give up for me and I know I could neva do that thenwe
mustnt

Do you mean we must part Not see each other again

What use would it be

None he owned She had risen and he stood up perforce May Imay I
come back to tell you

Tell me what she asked

You are right If I cant make it right I wont come But I wont say
good bye Icant

She let him go and Maddalena came in at the door Signorina she said
the signora is not well Shall I send for the doctor

Yes yes Maddalena Run cried Clementina distractedly She hurried
to Mrs Landers room where she found her too sick for reproaches for
anything but appeals for help and pity The girl had not to wait for
Doctor Welwrights coming to understand that the attack was severer than
any before

It lasted through the day and she could see that he was troubled It had
not followed upon any imprudeuce as Mrs Lander pathetically called
Clementina to witness when her pain had been so far quelled that she
could talk of her seizure

He found her greatly weakened by it the next day and he sat looking
thoughtfully at her before he said that she needed toning up She caught
at the notion Yes yes Thats what I need docta Toning up Thats
what I need

He suggested How would you like to try the sea air and the bathsat
Venice

Oh anything anywhere to get out of this dreadful hole I hant had a
well minute since I came And Clementina the sick woman whimpered is
so taken up all the time hea that I cant get the right attention

The doctor looked compassionately away from the girl and said Well we
must arrange about getting you off then

But I want you should go with me doctor and see me settled all right
You can cant you I shant cae how much it costs

The doctor said gravely he thought he could manage it and he ignored the
long unconscious sigh of relief that Clementina drew

In all her confusing anxieties for Mrs Lander Gregory remained at the
bottom of her heart a dumb ache When the pressure of her fears was taken
from her she began to suffer for him consciously then a letter came from
him

 I cannot make it right It is where it was and I feel that I must
 not see you again I am trying to do right but with the fear that
 I am wrong Send some word to help me before I go away tomorrow
 F G

It was what she had expected she knew now but it was none the less to
be borne because of her expectation She wrote back

 I believe you are doing the best you can and I shall always
 believe that

Her note brought back a long letter from him He said that whatever he
did or wherever he went he should try to be true to her ideal of him
If they renounced their love now for the sake of what seemed higher than
their love they might suffer but they could not choose but do as they
were doing

Clementina was trying to make what she could of this when Miss Milrays
name came up and Miss Milray followed it

I wanted to ask after Mrs Lander and I want you to tell her I did
Will you Dr Welwright says hes going to take her to Venice Well Im
sorrysorry for your going Clementina and Im truly sorry for the
cause of it I shall miss you my dear I shall indeed You know I always
wanted to steal you but youll do me the justice to say I never did and
I wont try now

Perhaps I wasnt worth stealing Clementina suggested with a
ruefulness in her smile that went to Miss Milrays heart

She put her arms round her and kissed her I wasnt very kind to you the
other day Clementina was I

I dont know Clementina faltered with halfaverted face

Yes you do I was trying to makebelieve that I didnt want to meddle
with your affairs but I was really vexed that you hadnt told me your
story before It hasnt taken me all this time to reflect that you
couldnt but it has to make myself come and confess that I had been dry
and cold with you She hesitated Its come out all right hasnt it
Clementina she asked tenderly You see I want to meddle now

We ah trying to think so sighed the girl

Tell me about it Miss Milray pulled her down on the sofa with her and
modified her embrace to a clasp of Clementinas bands

Why there isnt much to tell she began but she told what there was
and Miss Milray kept her countenance concerning the scruple that had
parted Clementina and her lover Perhaps he wouldnt have thought of
it she said in a final selfreproach if I hadnt put it into his
head

Well then Im not sorry you put it into his head cried Miss Milray
Clementina may I say what I think of Mr Gregorys performance

Why certainly Miss Milray

I think hes not merely a gloomy little bigot but a very hardhearted
little wretch and Im glad youre rid of him No stop Let me go on
You said I might she persisted at a protest which imparted itself from
Clementinas restive hands It was selfish and cruel of him to let you
believe that he had forgotten you It doesnt make it right now when an
accident has forced him to tell you that he cared for you all along

Why do you look at it that way Miss Milray If he was doing it on my
account

He may think he was doing it on your account but I think he was doing
it on his own In such a thing as that a man is bound by his mistakes
if he has made any He cant go back of them by simply ignoring them It
didnt make it the same for you when he decided for your sake that he
would act as if he had never spoken to you

I presume he thought that it would come right sometime Clementina
urged I did

Yes that was very well for you but it wasnt at all well for him He
behaved cruelly theres no other word for it

I dont believe he meant to be cruel Miss Milray said Clementina

Youre not sorry youve broken with him demanded Miss Milray
severely and she let go of Clementinas hands

I shouldnt want him to think I hadnt been faia

I dont understand what you mean by not being fair said Miss Milray
after a study of the girls eyes

I mean Clementina explained that if I let him think the religion was
all thee was it wouldnt have been faia

Why werent you sincere about that

Of couse I was returned the girl almost indignantly But if thee
was anything else I ought to have told him that too and I couldnt

Then you cant tell me of course Miss Milray rose in a little pique

Perhaps some day I will the girl entreated And perhaps that was
all

Miss Milray laughed Well if that was enough to end it Im satisfied
and Ill let you keep your mysteryif it is onetill we meet in Venice
I shall be there early in June Good bye dear and say good bye to Mrs
Lander for me

Dr Welwright got his patient a lodging on the Grand Canal in Venice and
decided to stay long enough to note the first effect of the air and the
baths and to look up a doctor to leave her with

This took something more than a week which could not all be spent in
Mrs Landers company much as she wished it There were hours which he
gave to going about in a gondola with Clementina whom he forbade to be
always at the invalids side He tried to reassure her as to Mrs
Landers health when he found her rather mute and absent while they
drifted in the silvery sun of the late April weather just beginning to
be warm but not warm enough yet for the tent of the open gondola He
asked her about Mrs Landers family and Clementina could only tell him
that she had always said she had none She told him the story of her own
relation to her and he said Yes I heard something of that from Miss
Milray After a moment of silence during which he looked curiously into
the girls eyes Do you think you can bear a little more care Miss
Claxon

I think I can said Clementina not very courageously but patiently

Its only this and I wouldnt tell you if I hadnt thought you equal to
it Mrs Landers case puzzles me But I shall leave Dr Tradonico
watching it and if it takes the turn that theres a chance it may take
he will tell you and youd better find out about her friends andlet
them know Thats all

Yes said Clementina as if it were not quite enough Perhaps she did
not fully realize all that the doctor had intended life alone is
credible to the young life and the expectation of it

The night before he was to return to Florence there was a full moon and
when he had got Mrs Lander to sleep he asked Clementina if she would not
go out on the lagoon with him He assigned no peculiar virtue to the
moonlight and he had no new charge to give her concerning his patient
when they were embarked He seemed to wish her to talk about herself and
when she strayed from the topic he prompted her return Then he wished
to know how she liked Florence as compared with Venice and all the
other cities she had seen and when she said she had not seen any but
Boston and New York and London for one night he wished to know whether
she liked Florence as well She said she liked it best of all and he
told her he was very glad for he liked it himself better than any place
he had ever seen He spoke of his family in America which was formed of
grownup brothers and sisters so that he had none of the closest and
tenderest ties obliging him to return there was no reason why he should
not spend all his days in Florence except for some brief visits home It
would be another thing with such a place as Venice he could never have
the same settled feeling there it was beautiful but it was unreal it
would be like spending ones life at the opera Did not she think so

She thought so oh yes she never could have the homefeeling at Venice
that she had at Florence

Exactly thats what I meanta homefeeling Im glad you had it He
let the gondola dip and slide forward almost a minute before he added
with an effect of pulling a voice up out of his throat somewhere How
would you like to live therewith meas my wife

Why what do you mean Dr Welwright asked Clementina with a vague
laugh

Dr Welwright laughed too but not vaguely there was a mounting
cheerfulness in his laugh What I say I hope it isnt very surprising

No but I never thought of such a thing

Perhaps you will think of it now

But youre not in eanest

Im thoroughly in earnest said the doctor and he seemed very much
amused at her incredulity

Then Im sorry she answered I couldnt

No he said still with amusement or with a courage that took that
form Why not

Because I amnot free

For an interval they were so silent that they could hear each other
breathe Then after he had quietly bidden the gondolier go back to their
hotel he asked If you had been free you might have answered me
differently

I dont know said Clementina candidly I never thought of it

It isnt because you disliked me

Oh no

Then I must get what comfort I can out of that I hope with all my
heart that you may be happy

Why Dr Welwright said Clementina Dont you suppose that I should
be glad to do it if I could Any one would

It doesnt seem very probable just now he answered humbly But Ill
believe it if you say so

I do say so and I always shall

Thank you

Dr Welwright professed himself ready for his departure at breakfast
next morning and he must have made his preparations very late or very
early He was explicit in his charges to Clementina concerning Mrs
Lander and at the end of them he said She will not know when she is
asking too much of you but you will and you must act upon your
knowledge And remember if you are in need of help of any kind youre
to let me know Will you

Yes I will Dr Welwright

People will be going away soon and I shall not be so busy I can come
back if Dr Tradonico thinks it necessary

He left Mrs Lander full of resolutions to look after her own welfare in
every way and she went out in her gondola the same morning She was not
only to take the air as much as possible but she was to amuse herself
and she decided that she would have her second breakfast at the Caffe
Florian Venice was beginning to fill up with arrivals from the south
and it need not have been so surprising to find Mr Hinkle there over a
cup of coffee He said he had just that moment been thinking of her and
meaning to look her up at the hotel He said that he had stopped at
Venice because it was such a splendid place to introduce his gleaner he
invited Mrs Lander to become a partner in the enterprise he promised
her a return of fifty per cent on her investment If he could once
introduce his gleaner in Venice he should be a made man He asked Mrs
Lander with real feeling how she was as for Miss Clementina he need
not ask

Oh indeed the docta thinks she wants a little lookin after too
said Mrs Lander

Well about as much as you do Mrs Lander Hinkle allowed tolerantly
I dont know how it affects you maam such a meeting of friends in
these strange waters but its building me right up Its made another
man of me already and Ive got the other mans appetite too Mind my
letting him have his breakfast here with me at your table He bade the
waiter just fetch his plate He attached himself to them he spent the
day with them Mrs Lander asked him to dinner at her lodgings and left
him to Clementina over the coffee

Shes looking fine doesnt the doctor think This air will do
everything for her

Oh yes shes a great deal betta than she was befoe we came

Thats right Well now youve got me here you must let me make myself
useful any way I can Ive got a spare month that I can put in here in
Venice just as well as not I shant want to push north till the
frosts out of the ground They wouldnt have a chance to try my gleaner
on the other side of the Alps much before September anyway Now in
Ohio the part I come from we cut our wheat in June When is your wheat
harvest at Middlemount

Clementina laughed I dont believe weve got any I guess its all
grass

I wish you could see our country out there once

Is it nice

Nice Were right in the centre of the state measuring from north to
south on the old National Road Clementina had never heard of this
road but she did not say so About five miles back from the Ohio River
where the coal comes up out of the ground because theres so much of it
theres no room for it below Our farms in a valley along a creek
bottom what you Yankees call an intervals weve got three hundred
acres My grandfather took up the land and then he went back to
Pennsylvania to get the girl hed left therewe were Pennsylvania Dutch
thats where I got my romantic namethey drove all the way out to Ohio
again in his buggy and when he came in sight of our valley with his
bride he stood up in his buggy and pointed with his whip There As far
as the sky is blue its all ours

Clementina owned the charm of his story as he seemed to expect but when
he said Yes I want you to see that country some day she answered
cautiously

It must be lovely But I dont expect to go West eva

I like your Eastern way of saying everr said Hinkle and he said it in
his Western way I like New England folks

Clementina smiled discreetly They have their faults like everybody
else I presume

Ah thats a regular Yankee word presume said Hinkle Our teacher
my first one always said presume She was from your State too




XXIX

In the time of provisional quiet that followed for Clementina she was
held from the remorses and misgivings that had troubled her before Hinkle
came She still thought that she had let Dr Welwright go away believing
that she had not cared enough for the offer which had surprised her so
much and she blamed herself for not telling him how doubly bound she was
to Gregory though when she tried to put her sense of this in words to
herself she could not make out that she was any more bound to him than
she had been before they met in Florence unless she wished to be so Yet
somehow in this time of respite neither the regret for Dr Welwright nor
the question of Gregory persisted very strongly and there were whole
days when she realized before she slept that she had not thought of
either

She was in full favor again with Mrs Lander whom there was no one to
embitter in her jealous affection Hinkle formed their whole social
world and Mrs Lander made the most of him She was always having him to
the dinners which her landlord served her from a restaurant in her
apartment and taking him out with Clementina in her gondola He came
into a kind of authority with them both which was as involuntary with him
as with them and was like an effect of his constant wish to be doing
something for them

One morning when they were all going out in Mrs Landers gondola she
sent Clementina back three times to their rooms for outer garments of
differing density When she brought the last Mrs Lander frowned

This wont do Ive got to have something elsesomething lighter and
warma

I cant go back any moa Mrs Landa cried the girl from the
exasperation of her own nerves

Then I will go back myself said Mrs Lander with dignity and we
shant need the gondoler any more this moning she added unless you
and Mr Hinkle wants to ride

She got ponderously out of the boat with the help of the gondoliers
elbow and marched into the house again while Clementina followed her
She did not offer to help her up the stairs Hinkle had to do it and he
met the girl slowly coming up as he returned from delivering Mrs Lander
over to Maddalena

Shes all right now he ventured to say tentatively

Is she Clementina coldly answered

In spite of her repellent air he persisted Shes a pretty sick woman
isnt she

The docta doesnt say

Well I think it would be safe to act on that supposition Miss
ClementinaI think she wants to see you

Im going to her directly

Hinkle paused rather daunted She wants me to go for the doctor

Shes always wanting the docta Clementina lifted her eyes and looked
very coldly at him

If I were you Id go up right away he said boldly

She felt that she ought to resent his interference but the mild entreaty
of his pale blue eyes or the elderbrotherly injunction of his smile
forbade her Did she ask for me

No

Ill go to her she said and she kept herself from smiling at the long
sigh of relief he gave as she passed him on the stairs

Mrs Lander began as soon as she entered her room Well I was just
wonderin if you was goin to leave me here all day alone while you
staid down thee carryin on with that simpleton I dont know whats
got into the men

Mr Hinkle has gone for the docta said Clementina trying to get into
her voice the kindness she was trying to feel

Well if I have one of my attacks now youll have yourself to thank
for it

By the time Dr Tradonico appeared Mrs Lander was so much better that in
her revulsion of feeling she was all day rather tryingly affectionate in
her indirect appeals for Clementinas sympathy

I dont want you should mind what I say when I ant feelin just
right she began that evening after she had gone to bed and Clementina
sat looking out of the open window on the moonlit lagoon

Oh no the girl answered wearily

Mrs Lander humbled herself farther Im real sorry I plagued you so
today and I know Mr Hinkle thought I was dreadful but I couldnt help
it I should like to talk with you Clementina about something thats
worryin me if you ant busy

Im not busy now Mrs Lander said Clementina a little coldly and
relaxing the clasp of her hands to knit her fingers together had been
her sole business and she put even this away

She did not come nearer the bed and Mrs Lander was obliged to speak
without the advantage of noting the effect of her words upon her in her
face Its like this What am I agoin to do for them relations of Mr
Landas out in Michigan

I dont know What relations

I told you about em the only ones hes got his halfsistas children
He neva saw em and he neva wanted to but theyre his kin and it was
his money It dont seem right to pass em ova Do you think it would
yourself Clementina

Why of couse not Mrs Lander It wouldnt be right at all

Mrs Lander looked relieved and she said as if a little surprised Im
glad you feel that way I should feel just so myself I mean to do by
you just what I always said I should I shant forget you but whee
thees so much I got to thinkin theed ought to some of it go to his
folks whetha he caed for em or not Its worried me some and I guess
if anything its that thats made me wose lately

Why by Mrs Landa said the girl Why dont you give it all to them

You dont know what youa talkin about said Mrs Lander severely
I guess if I give em five thousand or so amongstem its full moa than
they eve thought of havin and its moa than they got any right to
Well thats all right then and we dont need to talk about it any moa
Yes she resumed after a moment thats what I shall do I hunt eva
felt just satisfied with that last will I got made and I guess I shall
tear it up and get the fust American lawyer that comes along to make me
a new one The proptys all goin to you but I guess I shall leave five
thousand apiece to the two families out thee You wont miss it any
and I presume its what Mr Landa would expect I should do though why he
didnt do it himself I cant undastand unless it was to show his
confidence in me

She began to ask Clementina how she felt about staying in Venice all
summer she said she had got so much better there already that she
believed she should be well by fall if she stayed on She was certain
that it would put her all back if she were to travel now and in Europe
where it was so hard to know how to get to places she did not see how
they could pick out any that would suit them as well as Venice did

Clementina agreed to it all more or less absentmindedly as she sat
looking into the moonlight and the day that had begun so stormily ended
in kindness between them

The next morning Mrs Lander did not wish to go out and she sent
Clementina and Hinkle together as a proof that they were all on good
terms again She did not spare the girl this explanation in his presence
and when they were in the gondola he felt that he had to say I was
afraid you might think I was rather meddlesome yesterday

Oh no she answered I was glad you did

Yes he returned I thought you would be afterwards He looked at her
wistfully with his slanted eyes and his odd twisted smile and they both
gave way in the same conscious laugh What I like he explained
further is to be understood when Ive said something that doesnt mean
anything dont you You know anybody can understand you if you really
mean something but most of the time you dont and thats when a friend
is useful I wish youd call on me if youre ever in that fix

Oh I will Mr Hinkle Clementina promised gayly

Thank you he said and her gayety seemed to turn him graver Miss
Clementina might I go a little further in this direction without
danger

What direction she added with a flush of sudden alarm

Mrs Lander

Why suttainly she answered in quick relief

I wish youd let me do some of the worrying about her for you while Im
here You know I havent got anything else to do

Why I dont believe I worry much Im afraid I foget about her when
Im not with her Thats the wost of it

No no he entreated thats the best of it But I want to do the
worrying for you even when youre with her Will you let me

Why if you want to so very much

Then its settled he said dismissing the subject

But she recurred to it with a lingering compunction

I presume that I dont remember how sick she is because Ive neva been
sick at all myself

Well he returned You neednt be sorry for that altogether There are
worse things than being well though sick people dont always think so
Ive wasted a good deal of time the other way though Ive reformed
now

They went on to talk about themselves sometimes they talked about
others in excursions which were more or less perfunctory and were
merely in the way of illustration or instance She got so far in one of
these as to speak of her family and he seemed to understand them He
asked about them all and he said he believed in her fathers unworldly
theory of life He asked her if they thought at home that she was like
her father and he added as if it followed Im the worldling of my
family I was the youngest child and the only boy in a flock of girls
That always spoils a boy

Are you spoiled she asked

Well Im afraid theyd be surprised if I didnt come to grief
somehowall butmother she expects Ill be kept from harm

Is she religious

Yes shes a Moravian Did you ever hear of them Clementina shook her
head Theyre something like the Quakers and something like the
Methodists They dont believe in war but they have bishops

And do you belong to her church

No said the young man I wish I did for her sake I dont belong to
any Do you

No I go to the Episcopal at home Perhaps I shall belong sometime But
I think that is something everyone must do for themselves He looked a
little alarmed at the note of severity in her voice and she explained
I mean that if you try to be religious for anything besides religion it
isnt being religiousand no one else has any right to ask you to be

Oh thats what I believe too he said with comic relief I didnt
know but Id been trying to convert you without knowing it They both
laughed and were then rather seriously silent

He asked after a moment in a fresh beginning Have you heard from Miss
Milray since you left Florence

Oh yes didnt I tell you Shes coming here in June

Well she wont have the pleasure of seeing me then Im going the last
of May

I thought you were going to stay a month she protested

That will be a month and more too

So it will she owned

Im glad it doesnt seem any longersay a yearMiss Clementina

Oh not at all she returned Miss Milrays brother and his wife are
coming with her Theyve been in Egypt

I never saw them said Hinkle He paused before he added Well it
would seem rather crowded after they get here I suppose and he
laughed while Clementina said nothing




XXX

Hinkle came every morning now to smoothe out the doubts and difficulties
that had accumulated in Mrs Landers mind over night and incidentally
to propose some pleasure for Clementina who could feel that he was
pitying her in her slavery to the sick womans whims and yet somehow
entreating her to bear them He saw them together in what Mrs Lander
called her well days but there were other days when he saw Clementina
alone and then she brought him word from Mrs Lander and reported his
talk to her after he went away On one of these she sent him a
cheerfuller message than usual and charged the girl to explain that she
was ever so much better but had not got up because she felt that every
minute in bed was doing her good Clementina carried back his regrets and
congratulation and then told Mrs Lander that he had asked her to go out
with him to see a church which he was sorry Mrs Lander could not see
too He professed to be very particular about his churches for he said
he had noticed that they neither of them had any great gift for sights
and he had it on his conscience to get the best for them He told
Clementina that the church he had for them now could not be better if it
had been built expressly for them instead of having been used as a place
of worship for eight or ten generations of Venetians before they came
She gave his invitation to Mrs Lander who could not always be trusted
with his jokes and she received it in the best part

Well you go she said Maddalena can look after me I guess Hes the
only one of the fellas except that lod that Id give a cent for She
added with a sudden lapse from her pleasure in Hinkle to her severity
with Clementina But you want to be caeful what you doin

Caeful

YesAbout Mr Hinkle I ant agoin to have you lead him on and then
say you didnt know where he was goin I cant keep runnin away
everywhee fo you the way I done at Woodlake

Clementinas heart gave a leap whether joyful or woeful but she
answered indignantly How can you say such a thing to me Mrs Lander
Im not leading him on

I dont know what you call it Youre round with him in the gondoler
night and day and when hes hee youa settin with him half the time
on the balcony and its talk talk the whole while Clementina took in
the fact with silent recognition and Mrs Lander went on I aint
sayin anything against it Hes the only one I dont believe is afta the
money he thinks youa goin to have but if you dont want him you want
to look what youre about

The girl returned to Hinkle in the embarrassment which she was helpless
to hide and without the excuse which she could not invent for refusing
to go with him Is Mrs Lander worseor anything he asked

Oh no Shes quite well said Clementina but she left it for him to
break the constraint in which they set out He tried to do so at
different points but it seemed to close upon themthe more inflexibly
At last he asked as they were drawing near the church Have you ever
seen anything of Mr Belsky since you left Florence

No she said with a nervous start What makes you ask

I dont know But you see nearly everybody again that you meet in your
travels That friend of histhat Mr Gregoryhe seems to have dropped
out too I believe you told me you used to know him in America

Yes she answered briefly she could not say more and Hinkle went on
It seemed to me that as far as I could make him out he was about as
much of a crank in his way as the Russian Its curious but when you
were talking about religion the other day you made me think of him
The blood went to Clementinas heart I dont suppose you had him in
mind but what you said fitted him more than anyone I know of I could
have almost believed that he had been trying to convert you She stared
at him and he laughed He tackled me one day there in Florence all of a
sudden and I didnt know what to say exactly Of course I respected
his earnestness but I couldnt accept his view of things and I tried to
tell him so I had to say just where I stood and why and I mentioned
some books that helped to get me there He said he never read anything
that went counter to his faith and I saw that he didnt want to save me
so much as he wanted to convince me He didnt know it and I didnt tell
him that I knew it but I got him to let me drop the subject He seems to
have been left over from a time when people didnt reason about their
beliefs but only argued I didnt think there was a man like that to be
found so late in the century especially a young man But that was just
where I was mistaken If there was to be a man of that kind at all it
would have to be a young one Hell be a good deal openerminded when
hes older He was conscientious I could see that and he did take the
Russians death to heart as long as he was dead But Id like to talk
with him ten years from now he wouldnt be where he is

Clementina was still silent and she walked up the church steps from the
gondola without the power to speak She made no show of interest in the
pictures and statues she never had really cared much for such things
and now his attempts to make her look at them failed miserably When they
got back again into the boat he began Miss Clementina Im afraid I
oughtnt to have spoken as I did of that Mr Gregory If he is a friend
of yours

He is she made herself answer

I didnt mean anything against him I hope you dont think I wanted to
be unfair

You were not unfair But I oughtnt to have let you say it Mr Hinkle
I want to tell you somethingI mean I mustShe found herself panting
and breathless You ought to know itMr Gregory isI mean we are

She stopped and she saw that she need not say more

In the days that followed before the time that Hinkle had fixed to leave
Venice he tried to come as he had been coming to see Mrs Lander but
he evaded her when she wished to send him out with Clementina His
quaintness had a heartache in it for her and he was boyishly simple in
his failure to hide his suffering He had no explicit right to suffer
for he had asked nothing and been denied nothing but perhaps for this
reason she suffered the more keenly for him

A senseless resentment against Gregory for spoiling their happiness crept
into her heart and she wished to show Hinkle how much she valued his
friendship at any risk and any cost When this led her too far she took
herself to task with a severity which hurt him too In the midst of the
impulses on which she acted there were times when she had a confused
longing to appeal to him for counsel as to how she ought to behave toward
him

There was no one else whom she could appeal to Mrs Lander after her
first warning had not spoken of him again though Clementina could feel
in the grimness with which she regarded her variable treatment of him
that she was silently hoarding up a sum of inculpation which would crush
her under its weight when it should fall upon her She seemed to be
growing constantly better now and as the interval since her last attack
widened behind her she began to indulge her appetite with a recklessness
which Clementina in a sense of her own unworthiness was helpless to
deal with When she ventured to ask her once whether she ought to eat of
something that was very unwholesome for her Mrs Lander answered that
she had taken her case into her own hands now for she knew more about
it than all the doctors She would thank Clementina not to bother about
her she added that she was at least not hurting anybody but herself and
she hoped Clementina would always be able to say as much

Clementina wished that Hinkle would go away but not before she had
righted herself with him and he lingered his month out and seemed as
little able to go as she to let him She had often to be cheerful for
both when she found it too much to be cheerful for herself In his
absence she feigned free and open talks with him and explained
everything and experienced a kind of ghostly comfort in his imagined
approval and forgiveness but in his presence nothing really happened
except the alternation of her kindness and unkindness in which she was
too kind and then too unkind

The morning of the day he was at last to leave Venice he came to say
good bye He did not ask for Mrs Lander when the girl received him and
he did not give himself time to lose courage before he began Miss
Clementina I dont know whether I ought to speak to you after what I
understood you to mean about Mr Gregory He looked steadfastly at her
but she did not answer and he went on Theres just one chance in a
million though that I didnt understand you rightly and Ive made up
my mind that I want to take that chance May I She tried to speak but
she could not If I was wrongif there was nothing between you and
himcould there ever be anything between you and me

His pleading looks entreated her even more than his words

There was something she answered with him

And I mustnt know what the young man said patiently

Yesyes she returned eagerly Oh yes I want you to knowI want to
tell you I was only sixteen yeas old and he said that he oughtnt to
have spoken we were both too young But last winta he spoke again He
said that he had always felt boundShe stopped and he got infirmly to
his feet I wanted to tell you from the fust but

How could you You couldnt I havent anything more to say if you are
bound to him

He is going to be a missionary and he wanted me to say that I would
believe just as he did and I couldnt But I thought that it would come
right andyes I felt bound to him too That is allI cant explain
it

Oh I understand he returned listlessly

And do you blame me for not telling before She made an involuntary
movement toward him a pathetic gesture which both entreated and
compassionated

Theres nobody to blame You have tried to do just right by me as well
as him Well Ive got my answer Mrs Landercan I

Why she isnt up yet Mr Hinkle Clementina put all her pain for him
into the expression of their regret

Then Ill have to leave my goodbye for her with you I dont believe I
can come back again He looked round as if he were dizzy Goodbye he
said and offered his hand It was cold as clay

When he was gone Clementina went into Mrs Landers room and gave her
his message

Couldnt he have come back this aftanoon to see me if he aint goin
till five she demanded jealously

He said he couldnt come back Clementina answered sadly

The woman turned her head on her pillow and looked at the girls face
Oh she said for all comment




XXXI

The Milrays came a month later to seek a milder sun than they had left
burning in Florence The husband and wife had been sojourning there since
their arrival from Egypt but they had not been his sisters guests and
she did not now pretend to be of their party though the same train even
the same carriage had brought her to Venice with them They went to a
hotel and Miss Milray took lodgings where she always spent her Junes
before going to the Tyrol for the summer

You are wonderfully improved every way Mrs Milray said to Clementina
when they met I knew you would be if Miss Milray took you in hand and
I can see she has What she doesnt know about the world isnt worth
knowing I hope she hasnt made you too worldly But if she has shes
taught you how to keep from showing it youre just as innocentlooking
as ever and thats the main thing you oughtnt to lose that You
wouldnt dance a skirt dance now before a ships company but if you did
no one would suspect that you knew any better Have you forgiven me yet
Well I didnt use you very well Clementina and I never pretended I
did Ive eaten a lot of humble pie for that my dear Did Miss Milray
tell you that I wrote to her about it Of course you wont say how she
told you but she ought to have done me the justice to say that I tried
to be a friend at court with her for you If she didnt she wasnt
fair

She neva said anything against you Mrs Milray Clementina answered

Discreet as ever my dear I understand And I hope you understand about
that old affair too by this time It was a complication I had to get
back at Lioncourt somehow and I dont honestly think now that his
admiration for a young girl was a very wholesome thing for her But never
mind You had that Boston goose in Florence too last winter and I
suppose he gobbled up what little Miss Milray had left of me But shes
charming I could go down on my knees to her art when she really tries to
finish any one

Clementina noticed that Mrs Milray had got a new way of talking She had
a chirpiness and a lift in her inflections which if it was not exactly
English was no longer Western American Clementina herself in her
association with Hinkle had worn off her English rhythm and in her long
confinement to the conversation of Mrs Lander she had reverted to her
clipped Yankee accent Mrs Milray professed to like it and said it
brought back so delightfully those pleasant days at Middlemount when
Clementina really was a child I met somebody at Cairo who seemed very
glad to hear about you though he tried to seem not Can you guess who it
was I see that you never could in the world We got quite chummy one
day when we were going out to the pyramids together and he gave himself
away finely Hes a simple soul But when theyre in love theyre all
so It was a little queer colloguing with the exheadwaiter on society
terms but the headwaitership was merely an episode and the main thing
is that he is very talented and is going to be a minister Its a pity
hes so devoted to his crazy missionary scheme Some one ought to get
hold of him and point him in the direction of a rich New York
congregation Hed find heathen enough among them and he could do the
greatest amount of good with their money I tried to talk it into him I
suppose you saw him in Florence this spring she suddenly asked

Yes Clementina answered briefly

And you didnt make it up together I got that much out of Miss Milray
Well if he were here I should find out why But I dont suppose you
would tell me She waited a moment to see if Clementina would and then
she said Its a pity for Ive a notion I could help you and I think I
owe you a good turn for the way I behaved about your dance But if you
dont want my help you dont

I would say so if I did Mrs Milray said Clementina I was hut at
the time but I dont care anything for it now I hope you wont think
about it any more

Thank you said Mrs Milray Ill try not to and she laughed But I
should like to do something to prove my repentance

Clementina perceived that for some reason she would rather have more than
less cause for regret and that she was mocking her but she was without
the wish or the power to retaliate and she did not try to fathom Mrs
Milrays motives Most motives in life even bad motives lie nearer the
surface than most people commonly pretend and she might not have had to
dig deeper into Mrs Milrays nature for hers than that layer of her
consciousness where she was aware that Clementina was a pet of her
sisterinlaw For no better reason she herself made a pet of Mrs
Lander whose dislike of Miss Milray was not hard to divine and whose
willingness to punish her through Clementina was akin to her own The
sick woman was easily flattered back into her first belief in Mrs Milray
and accepted her large civilities and small services as proof of her
virtues She began to talk them into Clementina and to contrast them
with the wicked principles and actions of Miss Milray

The girl had forgiven Mrs Milray but she could not go back to any trust
in her and she could only passively assent to her praise When Mrs
Lander pressed her for anything more explicit she said what she thought
and then Mrs Lander accused her of hating Mrs Milray who was more her
friend than some that flattered her up for everything and tried to make
a fool of her

I undastand now she said one day what that recta meant by wantin me
to make life bad for you he saw how easy you was to spoil Miss Milray
is one to praise you to your face and disgrace you be hind your back
and so I tell you When Mrs Milray thought you done wrong she come and
said so and you cant forgive her

Clementina did not answer She had mastered the art of reticence in her
relations with Mrs Lander and even when Miss Milray tempted her one day
to give way she still had strength to resist But she could not deny
that Mrs Lander did things at times to worry her though she ended
compassionately with the reflection Shes sick

I dont think shes very sick now retorted her friend

No thats the reason shes so worrying When shes really sick shes
betta

Because shes frightened I suppose And how long do you propose to
stand it

I dont know Clementina listlessly answered

She couldnt get along without me I guess I can stand it till we go
home she says she is going home in the fall

Miss Milray sat looking at the girl a moment

Shall you be glad to go home

Oh yes indeed

To that place in the woods

Why yes What makes you ask

Nothing But Clementina sometimes I think you dont quite understand
yourself Dont you know that you are very pretty and very charming Ive
told you that often enough But shouldnt you like to be a great success
in the world Havent you ever thought of that Dont you care for
society

The girl sighed Yes I think thats all very nice I did cae one
while there in Florence last winter

My dear you dont know how much you were admired I used to tell you
because I saw there was no spoiling you but I never told you half If
you had only had the time for it you could have been the greatest sort of
success you were formed for it It wasnt your beauty alone lots of
pretty girls dont make anything of their beauty it was your
temperament You took things easily and naturally and thats what the
world likes It doesnt like your being afraid of it and you were not
afraid and you were not bold you were just right Miss Milray grew
more and more exhaustive in her analysis and enjoyed refining upon it
All that you needed was a little hardheartedness and that would have
come in time you would have learned how to hold your own but the chance
was snatched from you by that old cat I could weep over you when I think
how you have been wasted on her and now youre actually willing to go
back and lose yourself in the woods

I shouldnt call it being lost Miss Milray

I dont mean that and you must excuse me my dear But surely your
peopleyour father and motherwould want to have you get on in the
worldto make a brilliant match

Clementina smiled to think how far such a thing was from their
imaginations I dont believe they would cae You dont undastand about
them and I couldnt make you Fatha neva liked the notion of my being
with such a rich woman as Mrs Lander because it would look as if we
wanted her money

I never could have imagined that of you Clementina

I didnt think you could said the girl gratefully But now if I left
her when she was sick and depended on me it would look wohse yetas if
I did it because she was going to give her money to Mr Landas family
She wants to do that and I told her to I think that would be right
dont you

It would be right for you Clementina if you preferred itandI
should prefer it But it wouldnt be right for her She has given you
hopesshe has made promisesshe has talked to everybody

I dont cae for that I shouldnt like to feel beholden to any one and
I think it really belongs to his relations it was HIS

Miss Milray did not say anything to this She asked And if you went
back what would you do there Labor in the fields as poor little Belsky
advised

Clementina laughed No but I expect youll think its almost as crazy
You know how much I like dancing Well I think I could give dancing
lessons at the Middlemount There are always a good many children and
girls that have not grown up and I guess I could get pupils enough as
long as the summa lasted and come winter Im not afraid but what I
could get them among the young folks at the Center I used to teach them
before I left home

Miss Milray sat looking at her I dont know about such things but it
sounds sensiblelike everything about you my dear It sounds queer
perhaps because youre talking of such a White Mountain scheme here in
Venice

Yes dont it said Clementina sympathetically I was thinking of
that myself But I know I could do it I could go round to different
hotels different days Yes I should like to go home and they would be
glad to have me You cant think how pleasantly we live and were
company enough for each other I presume I should miss the things Ive
got used to ova here at fust but I dont believe I should care a great
while I dont deny but what the wold is nice but you have to pay for
it I dont mean that you would make me

No no We understand each other Go on

Miss Milray leaned towards her and pressed the girls arm reassuringly

As often happens with people when they are told to go on Clementina
found that she had not much more to say I think I could get along in
the wold well enough Yes I believe I could do it But I wasnt bohn
to it and it would be a great deal of troublea great deal moa than if
I had been bohn to it I think it would be too much trouble I would
rather give it up and go home when Mrs Landa wants to go back

Miss Milray did not speak for a time I know that you are serious
Clementina and youre wise always and good

It isnt that exactly said Clementina But is itI dont know how
to express it very wellis it woth while

Miss Milray looked at her as if she doubted the girls sincerity Even
when the world in return for our making it our whole life disappoints
and defeats us with its prizes we still question the truth of those who
question the value of these prizes we think they must be hopeless of
them or must be governed by some interest momentarily superior

Clementina pursued I know that you have had all you wanted of the
wold

Oh no the woman broke out almost in anguish Not what I wanted
What I tried for It never gave me what I wanted Itcouldnt

Well

It isnt worth while in that sense But if you cant have what you
wantif theres been a hollow left in your lifewhy the world goes a
great way towards filling up the aching void The tone of the last words
was lighter than their meaning but Clementina weighed them aright

Miss Milray she said pinching the edge of the table by which she sat
a little nervously and banging her head a little I think I can have
what I want 

Then give the whole world for it child

There is something I should like to tell you

Yes

For you to advise me about

I will my dear gladly and truly

He was here before you came He asked me

Miss Milray gave a start of alarm She said to gain time How did he
get here I supposed he was in Germany with his

No he was here the whole of May

Mr Gregory

Mr Gregory Clementinas face flushed and drooped Still lower I
meant Mr Hinkle But if you think I oughtnt

I dont think anything Im so glad I supposed from what you said about
the world that it must beBut if it isnt all the better If its Mr
Hinkle that you can have

Im not sure I can I should like to tell you just how it is and then
you will know It needed fewer words for this than she expected and
then Clementina took a letter from her pocket and gave it to Miss
Milray He wrote it on the train going away and its not very plain
but I guess you can make it out

Miss Milray received the penciled leaves which seemed to be pages torn
out of a notebook They were dated the day Hinkle left Venice and the
envelope bore the postmark of Verona They were not addressed but began
abruptly I believe I have made a mistake I ought not to have given you
up till I knew something that no one but you can tell me You are not
bound to any body unless you wish to be so That is what I see now and I
will not give you up if I can help it Even if you had made a promise
and then changed your mind you would not be bound in such a thing as
this I say this and I know you will not believe I say it because I want
you I do want you but I would not urge you to break your faith I only
ask you to realize that if you kept your word when your heart had gone
out of it you would be breaking your faith and if you broke your word
you would be keeping your faith But if your heart is still in your word
I have no more to say Nobody knows but you I would get out and take the
first train back to Venice if it were not for two things I know it would
be hard on me and I am afraid it might be hard on you But if you will
write me a line at Milan when you get this or if you will write to me
at London before July or at New York at any timefor I expect to wait
as long as I live

The letter ended here in the local addresses which the writer gave

Miss Milray handed the leaves back to Clementina who put them into her
pocket and apparently waited for her questions

And have you written

No said the girl slowly and thoughtfully I havent I wanted to at
fust and then I thought that if he truly meant what he said he would be
willing to wait

And why did you want to wait

Clementina replied with a question of her own Miss Milray what do you
think about Mr Gregory

Oh you mustnt ask me that my dear I was afraid I had told you too
plainly the last time

I dont mean about his letting me think he didnt cae for me so long
But dont you think he wants to do what is right Mr Gregory I mean

Well if you put me on my honor Im afraid I do

You see Clementina resumed He was the fust one and I did cae for
him a great deal and I might have gone on caring for him ifWhen I
found out that I didnt care any longer or so much it seemed to me as
if it must be wrong Do you think it was

Nono

When I got to thinking about some one else at fust it was only not
thinking about himI was ashamed Then I tried to make out that I was
too young in the fust place to know whether I really caed for any one
in the right way but after I made out that I was I couldnt feel
exactly easyand Ive been wanting to ask you Miss Milray

Ask me anything you like my dear

Why its only whether a person ought eva to change

We change whether we ought or not It isnt a matter of duty one way
or another

Yes but ought we to stop caring for somebody when perhaps we shouldnt
if somebody else hadnt come between That is the question

No Miss Milray retorted that isnt at all the question The question
is which you want and whether you could get him Whichever you want most
it is right for you to have

Do you truly think so

I do indeed This is the one thing in life where one may choose safest
what one likes best I mean if there is nothing bad in the man himself

I was afraid it would be wrong That was what I meant by wanting to be
faia with Mr Gregory when I told you about him there in Florence I
dont believe but what it had begun then

What had begun

About Mr Hinkle

Miss Milray burst into a laugh Clementina youre delicious The girl
looked hurt and Miss Milray asked seriously Why do you like Mr Hinkle
bestif you do

Clementina sighed Oh I dont know Hes so resting

Then that settles it From first to last what we poor women want is
rest It would be a wicked thing for you to throw your life away on some
one who would worry you out of it I dont wish to say any thing against
Mr Gregory I dare say he is goodand conscientious but life is a
struggle at the best and its your duty to take the best chance for
resting

Clementina did not look altogether convinced whether it was Miss
Milrays logic or her morality that failed to convince her She said
after a moment I should like to see Mr Gregory again

What good would that do

Why then I should know

Know what

Whether I didnt really cae for him any moreor so much

Clementina said Miss Milray you mustnt make me lose patience with
you

No But I thought you said that it was my duty to do what I wished

Well yes That is what I said Miss Milray consented But I supposed
that you knew already

No said Clementina candidly I dont believe I do

And what if you dont see him

I guess I shall have to wait till I do Thee will be time enough

Miss Milray sighed and then she laughed You ARE young




XXXII

Miss Milray went from Clementina to call upon her sisterinlaw and
found her brother which was perhaps what she hoped might happen

Do you know she said that that old wretch is going to defraud that
poor thing after all and leave her money to her husbands halfsisters
children

You wish me to infer the Mrs LanderClementina situation Milray
returned

Yes

Im glad you put it in terms that are not actionable then for your
words are decidedly libellous

What do you mean

Ive just been writing Mrs Landers will for her and shes left all
her property to Clementina except five thousand apiece to the
halfsisters three children

I cant believe it

Well said Milray with his gentle smile I think thats safe ground
for you Mrs Lander will probably have time enough to change her will as
well as her mind several times yet before she dies The halfsisters
children may get their rights yet

I wish they might said Miss Milray with an impassioned sigh Then
perhaps I should get Clementinafor a while

Her brother laughed Isnt there somebody else wants Clementina

Oh plenty But shes not sure she wants anybody else

Does she want you

No I cant say she does She wants to go home

Thats not a bad scheme I should like to go home myself if I had one
What would you have done with Clementina if you had got her Jenny

What would any one have done with her Married her brilliantly of
course

But you say she isnt sure she wishes to be married at all

Miss Milray stated the case of Clementinas divided mind and her belief
that she would take Hinkle in the end together with the fear that she
might take Gregory Shes very odd Miss Milray concluded She puzzles
me Why did you ever send her to me

Milray laughed I dont know I thought she would amuse you and I
thought it would be a pleasure to her

They began to talk of some affairs of their own from which Miss Milray
returned to Clementina with the ache of an imperfectly satisfied
intention If she had meant to urge her brother to seek justice for the
girl from Mrs Lander she was not so well pleased to have found justice
done already But the will had been duly signed and witnessed before the
American viceconsul and she must get what good she could out of an
accomplished fact It was at least a consolation to know that it put an
end to her sisterinlaws patronage of the girl and it would be
interesting to see Mrs Milray adapt her behavior to Clementinas
fortunes She did not really dislike her sisterinlaw enough to do her a
wrong she was only willing that she should do herself a wrong But one
of the most disappointing things in all hostile operations is that you
never can know what the enemy would be at and Mrs Milrays manoeuvres
were sometimes dictated by such impulses that her strategy was peculiarly
baffling The thought of her past unkindness to Clementina may still have
rankled in her or she may simply have felt the need of outdoing Miss
Milray by an unapproachable benefaction It is certain that when Baron
Belsky came to Venice a few weeks after her own arrival they began to
pose at each other with reference to Clementina she with a measure of
consciousness he with the singleness of a nature that was all pose In
his forbearance to win Clementina from Gregory he had enjoyed the
distinction of an unique suffering and in allowing the fact to impart
itself to Mrs Milray he bathed in the warmth of her flattering
sympathy Before she withdrew this as she must when she got tired of
him she learned from him where Gregory was for it seemed that Gregory
had so far forgiven the past that they had again written to each other

During the fortnight of Belskys stay in Venice Mrs Lander was much
worse and Clementina met him only once very brieflyShe felt that he
had behaved like a very silly person but that was all over now and she
had no wish to punish him for it At the end of his fortnight he went
northward into the Austrian Tyrol and a few days later Gregory came down
from the Dolomites to Venice

It was in his favor with Clementina that he yielded to the impulse he had
to come directly to her and that he let her know with the first words
that he had acted upon hopes given him through Belsky from Mrs Milray
He owned that he doubted the authority of either to give him these hopes
but he said he could not abandon them without a last effort to see her
and learn from her whether they were true or false

If she recognized the design of a magnificent reparation in what Mrs
Milray had done she did not give it much thought Her mind was upon
distant things as she followed Gregorys explanation of his presence and
in the muse in which she listened she seemed hardly to know when he
ceased speaking

I know it must seem to take something for granted which Ive no right to
take for granted I dont believe you could think that I cared for
anything but you or at all for what Mrs Lander has done for you

Do you mean her leaving me her money asked Clementina with that
boldness her sex enjoys concerning matters of finance and affection

Yes said Gregory blushing for her As far as I should ever have a
right to care I could wish there were no money It could bring no
blessing to our life We could do no good with it nothing but the
sacrifice of ourselves in poverty could be blessed to us

That is what I thought too Clementina replied

Oh then you did think

But afterwards I changed my Mind If she wants to give me her money I
shall take it

Gregory was blankly silent again

I shouldnt know how to refuse and I dont know as I should have any
right to Gregory shrank a little from her reyankeefied English as well
as from the apparent cynicism of her speech but he shrank in silence
still She startled him by asking with a kindness that was almost
tenderness Mr Gregory how do you think anything has changed

Changed

You know how it was when you went away from Florence Do you think
differently now I dont I dont think I ought to do something for you
and pretend that I was doing it for religion I dont believe the way you
do and I know I neva shall Do you want me in spite of my saying that I
can neva help you in your work because I believe in it

But if you believe in me

She shook her head compassionately You know we ahgued that out before
We are just whee we were I am sorry Nobody had any right to tell you
to come hee But I am glad you came She saw the hope that lighted up
his face but she went on unrelentinglyI think we had betta be free

Free

Yes from each other I dont know how you have felt but I have not
felt free It has seemed to me that I promised you something If I did I
want to take my promise back and be free

Her frankness appealed to his own You are free I never held you bound
to me in my fondest hopes You have always done right

I have tried to And I am not going to let you go away thinking that the
reason I said is the only reason It isnt I wish to be free
becausethere is some one else now It was hard to tell him this but
she knew that she must not do less and the train that carried him from
Venice that night bore a letter from her to Hinkle




XXXIII

Clementina told Miss Milray what had happened but with Mrs Milray the
girl left the sudden departure of Gregory to account for itself

They all went a week later and Mrs Milray having now done her whole
duty to Clementina had the easiest mind concerning her Miss Milray felt
that she was leaving her to greater trials than ever with Mrs Lander
but since there was nothing else she submitted as people always do with
the trials of others and when she was once away she began to forget her

By this time however it was really better for her With no one to
suspect of tampering with her allegiance Mrs Lander returned to her
former fondness for the girl and they were more peaceful if not happier
together again They had long talks such as they used to have and in
the first of these Clementina told her how and why she had written to Mr
Hinkle Mrs Lander said that it suited her exactly

There hant but just two men in Europe behaved like gentlemen to me
and one is Mr Hinkle and the other is that lod and between the two I
ratha youd have Mr Hinkle I dont know as I believe much in American
guls marryin lods the best of em

Clementina laughed Why Mrs Landa Lod Lioncout never thought of me
in the wold

You cant eva know Mrs Milray was tellin that hes what they call a
pooa lod and that he was carryin on with the American girls like
everything down there in Egypt last winta I guess if it comes to money
youd have enough to buy him and sell him again

The mention of money cast a chill upon their talk and Mrs Lander said
gloomily I dont know as I cae so much for that will Mr Milray made
for me after all I did want to say ten thousand apiece for Mr Landas
relations but I hated to befoe him Id told the whole kit of em so
much about you and I knew what they would think

She looked at Clementina with recurring grudge and the girl could not
bear it

Then why dont you tear it up and make another I dont want anything
unless you want me to have it and Id ratha not have anything

Yes and what would folks say afta youa taken care of me

Do you think I do it fo that

What do you do it fo

What did you want me to come with you fo

Thats true Mrs Lander brightened and warmed again I guess its all
right I guess I done right and I got to be satisfied I presume I could
get the consul to make me a will any time

Clementina did not relent so easily Mrs Landa whateva you do I dont
cae to know it and if you talk to me again about this I shall go home
I would stay with you as long as you needed me but I cant if you keep
bringing this up

I suppose you think you dont need me any moa Betta not be too sua

The girl jumped to her feet and Mrs Lander interposed Well thea I
didnt mean anything and I wont pesta you about it any moa But I think
its pretty had Who am I going to talk it ova with then

You can talk it ova with the viceconsul paid Clementina at random

Well thats so Mrs Lander let Clementina get her ready for the
night in sign of returning amity when she was angry with her she always
refused her help and made her send Maddalena

The summer heat increased and the sick woman suffered from it but she
could not be persuaded that she had strength to get away though the
viceconsul whom she advised with used all his logic with her He was a
gaunt and weary widower who described himself as being officially
between hay and grass the consul who appointed him had resigned after
going home and a new consul had not yet been sent out to remove him On
what she called her well days Mrs Lander went to visit him and she did
not mind his being in his shirtsleeves in the bit of garden where she
commonly found him with his collar and cravat off and clouded in his
own smoke when she was sick she sent for him to visit her He made
excuses as often as he could and if he saw Mrs Landers gondola coming
down the Grand Canal to his house he hurried on his cast clothing and
escaped to the Piazza at whatever discomfort and risk from the heat

I dont know how you stand it Miss Claxon he complained to
Clementina as soon as he learned that she was not a blood relation of
Mrs Landers and divined that she had her own reservations concerning
her But that woman will be the death of me if she keeps this up What
does she think Im here for If this goes on much longer Ill resign The
salary wont begin to pay for it What am I going to do I dont want to
hurt her feelings or not to help her but I know ten times as much about
Mrs Landers liver as I do about my own now

He treated Clementina as a person of mature judgment and a sage
discretion and he accepted what comfort she could offer him when she
explained that it was everything for Mrs Lander to have him to talk
with She gets tied of talking to me she urged and theres nobody
else now

Why dont she hire a valet de place and talk to him Id hire one
myself for her It would be a good deal cheaper for me Its as much as I
can do to stand this weather as it is

The viceconsul laughed forlornly in his exasperation but he agreed with
Clementina when she said in further excuse that Mrs Lander was really
very sick He pushed back his hat and scratched his head with a grimace

Of course weve got to remember shes sick and I shall need a little
sympathy myself if she keeps on at me this way I believe Ill tell her
about my liver next time and see how she likes it Look here Miss
Claxon Couldnt we get her off to some of those German watering places
that are good for her complaints I believe it would be the best thing
for hernot to mention me

Mrs Lander was moved by the suggestion which he made in person
afterwards it appealed to her old nomadic instinct but when the consul
was gone she gave it up We couldnt git thee Clementina I got to
stay hee till I git up my strenth I suppose youd be glad enough to
have me stat now thees nobody hee but me she added suspiciously
You git this scheme up or him

Clementina did not defend herself and Mrs Lander presently came to her
defence I dont believe but what he meant it fo the bestor you
whichever it was and I appreciate it but all is I couldnt git off I
guess this aia will do me as much good as anything come to have it a
little coola

They went every afternoon to the Lido where a wheeled chair met them
and Mrs Lander was trundled across the narrow island to the beach In
the evenings they went to the Piazza where their faces and figures had
become known and the Venetians gossipped them down to the last fact of
their relation with an accuracy creditable to their ingenuity in the
affairs of others To them Mrs Lander was the sick American very rich
and Clementina was her adoptive daughter who would have her millions
after her Neither knew the character they bore to the amiable and
inquisitive public of the Piazza or cared for the fine eyes that aimed
their steadfast gaze at them along the tubes of strawbarreled Virginia
cigars or across little cups of coffee Mrs Lander merely remarked that
the Venetians seemed great for gaping and Clementina was for the most
part innocent of their stare

She rested in the choice she had made in a content which was qualified by
no misgiving She was sorry for Gregory when she remembered him but her
thought was filled with some one else and she waited in faith and
patience for the answer which should come to the letter she had written
She did not know where her letter would find him or when she should hear
from him she believed that she should hear and that was enough She
said to herself that she would not lose hope if no answer came for
months but in her heart she fixed a date for the answer by letter and
an earlier date for some word by cable but she feigned that she did not
depend upon this and when no word came she convinced herself that she
had not expected any

It was nearing the end of the term which she had tacitly given her lover
to make the first sign by letter when one morning Mrs Lander woke her
She wished to say that she had got the strength to leave Venice at last
and she was going as soon as their trunks could be packed She had
dressed herself and she moved about restless and excited Clementina
tried to reason her out of her haste but she irritated her and fixed
her in her determination I want to get away I tell you I want to get
away she answered all persuasion and there seemed something in her
like the wish to escape from more than the oppressive environment though
she spoke of nothing but the heat and the smell of the canal I believe
its that moa than any one thing thats kept me sick hee she said
I tell you its the malariar and youll be down too if you stay

She made Clementina go to the bankers and get money to pay their
landlords bill and she gave him notice that they were going that
afternoon Clementina wished to delay till they had seen the viceconsul
and the doctor but Mrs Lander broke out I dont want to see em
either of em The docta wants to keep me hee and make money out of me
I undastand him and I dont believe that consuls a bit too good to take
a pussentage Now dont you say a wod to either of em If you dont do
exactly what I tell you Ill go away and leave you hee Now will you

Clementina promised and broke her word She went to the viceconsul and
told him she had broken it and she agreed with him that he had better
not come unless Mrs Lander sent for him The doctor promptly imagined
the situation and said he would come in casually during the morning so
as not to alarm the invalids suspicions He owned that Mrs Lander was
getting no good from remaining in Venice and if it were possible for her
to go he said she had better go somewhere into cooler and higher air

His opinion restored him to Mrs Landers esteem when it was expressed
to her and as she was left to fix the sum of her debt to him she made
it handsomer than anything he had dreamed of She held out against seeing
the viceconsul till the landlord sent in his account This was for the
whole month which she had just entered upon and it included fantastic
charges for things hitherto included in the rent not only for the
current month but for the months past when the landlord explained he
had forgotten to note them Mrs Lander refused to pay these demands for
they touched her in some of those economies which the gross rich practice
amidst their profusion The landlord replied that she could not leave his
house either with or without her effects until she had paid He
declared Clementina his prisoner too and he would not send for the
viceconsul at Mrs Landers bidding How far he was within his rights in
all this they could not know but he was perhaps himself doubtful and he
consented to let them send for the doctor who when he came behaved
like anything but the steadfast friend that Mrs Lander supposed she had
bought in him He advised paying the account without regard to its
justice as the shortest and simplest way out of the trouble but Mrs
Lander who saw him talking amicably and even respectfully with the
landlord when he ought to have treated him as an extortionate scamp
returned to her former ill opinion of him and the viceconsul now
appeared the friend that Doctor Tradonico had falsely seemed The doctor
consented in leaving her to her contempt of him to carry a message to
the viceconsul though he came back with his finger at the side of his
nose to charge her by no means to betray his bold championship to the
landlord

The viceconsul made none of those shows of authority which Mrs Lander
had expected of him She saw him even exchanging the common decencies
with the landlord when they met but in fact it was not hard to treat
the smiling and courteous rogue well In all their disagreement he had
looked as constantly to the comfort of his captives as if they had been
his chosen guests He sent Mrs Lander a much needed refreshment at the
stormiest moment of her indignation and he deprecated without retort the
denunciations aimed at him in Italian which did not perhaps carry so far
as his conscience The consul talked with him in a calm scarcely less
shameful than that of Dr Tradonico and at the end of their parley which
she had insisted upon witnessing he said

Well Mrs Lander youve got to stand this gouge or youve got to stand
a law suit I think the gouge would be cheaper in the end You see hes
got a right to his months rent

It aint the rent I cae for its the candles and the suvvice and the
things he says we broke It was undastood that everything was to be in
the rent and his two old chaias went to pieces of themselves when we
tried to pull em out from the wall and Ill neva pay for em in the
wold

Why the viceconsul pleaded its only about forty francs for the
whole thing

I dont care if its only fotty cents And I must say Mr Bennam
youre about the strangest viceconsul to want me to do it that I eva
saw

The viceconsul laughed unresentfully Well shall I send you a lawyer

No Mrs Lander retorted and after a moments reflection she added
Im goin to stay my month and so you may tell him and then Ill see
whetha he can make me pay for that breakage and the candles and suvvice
Im all wore out as it is and I aint fit to travel now and I dont
know when I shall be Clementina you can go and tell Maddalena to stop
packin Or no Ill do it

She left the room without further notice of the consul who said ruefully
to Clementina Well Ive missed my chance Miss Claxon but I guess
shes done the wisest thing for herself

Oh yes shes not fit to go She must stay now till its coola Will
you tell the landlod or shall

Ill tell him said the viceconsul and he had in the landlord He
received her message with the pleasure of a host whose cherished guests
have consented to remain a while longer and in the rush of his good
feeling he offered if the charge for breakage seemed unjust to the
viceconsul to abate it and since the signora had not understood that
she was to pay extra for the other things he would allow the viceconsul
to adjust the differences between them it was a trifle and he wished
above all things to content the signora for whom he professed a cordial
esteem both on his own part and the part of all his family

Then that lets me out for the present said the viceconsul when
Clementina repeated Mrs Landers acquiescence in the landlords
proposals and he took his straw hat and called a gondola from the
nearest traghetto and bargained at an expense consistent with his
salary to have himself rowed back to his own gardengate

The rest of the day was an era of better feeling between Mrs Lander and
her host than they had ever known and at dinner he brought in with his
own hand a dish which he said he had caused to be specially made for her
It was so tempting in odor and complexion that Mrs Lander declared she
must taste it though as she justly said she had eaten too much already
when it had once tasted it she ate it all against Clementinas
protestations she announced at the end that every bite had done her
good and that she never felt better in her life She passed a happy
evening with renewed faith in the air of the lagoon her sole regret now
was that Mr Lander had not lived to try it with her for if he had she
was sure he would have been alive at that moment

She allowed herself to be got to bed rather earlier than usual before
Clementina dropped asleep she heard her breathing with long easy quiet
respirations and she lost the fear of the landlords dish which had
haunted her through the evening She was awakened in the morning by a
touch on her shoulder Maddalena hung over her with a frightened face
and implored her to come and look at the signora who seemed not at all
well Clementina ran into her room and found her dead She must have
died some hours before without a struggle for the face was that of
sleep and it had a dignity and beauty which it had not worn in her life
of selfindulgent wilfulness for so many years that the girl had never
seen it look so before




XXXIV

The viceconsul was not sure how far his powers went in the situation
with which Mrs Lander had finally embarrassed him But he met the new
difficulties with patience and he agreed with Clementina that they ought
to see if Mrs Lander had left any written expression of her wishes
concerning the event She had never spoken of such a chance but had
always looked forward to getting well and going home so far as the girl
knew and the most careful search now brought to light nothing that bore
upon it In the absence of instructions to the contrary they did what
they must and the body emptied of its life of senseless worry and
greedy care was laid to rest in the island cemetery of Venice

When all was over the viceconsul ventured an observation which he had
hitherto delicately withheld The question of Mrs Landers kindred had
already been discussed between him and Clementina and he now felt that
another question had duly presented itself You didnt notice he
suggested anything like a will when we went over the papers He had
looked carefully for it expecting that there might have been some
expression of Mrs Landers wishes in it Because he added I happen
to know that Mr Milray drew one up for her I witnessed it

No said Clementina I didnt see anything of it She told me she had
made a will but she didnt quite like it and sometimes she thought she
would change it She spoke of getting you to do it I didnt know but she
had

The viceconsul shook his head No And these relations of her husbands
up in Michigan you dont know where they live exactly

No She neva told me she wouldnt she didnt like to talk about them
I dont even know their names

The viceconsul thoughtfully scratched a corner of his chin through his
beard If there isnt any will theyre the heirs I used to be a sort
of wildcat lawyer and I know that much law

Yes said Clementina She left them five thousand dollas apiece She
said she wished she had made it ten

I guess shes made it a good deal more if shes made it anything Miss
Claxon dont you understand that if no will turns up they come in for
all her money

Well thats what I thought they ought to do said Clementina

And do you understand that if thats so you dont come in for anything
You must excuse me for mentioning it but she has told everybody that you
were to have it and if there is no will

He stopped and bent an eye of lacklustre compassion on the girl who
replied Oh yes I know that its what I always told her to do I
didnt want it

You didnt want it

No

Well The viceconsul stared at her but he forbore the comment that
her indifference inspired He said after a pause Then what weve got to
do is to advertise for the Michigan relations and let em take any
action they want to

Thats the only thing we could do I presume

This gave the viceconsul another pause At the end of it he got to his
feet Is there anything I can do for you Miss Claxon

She went to her portfolio and produced Mrs Landers letter of credit It
had been made out for three thousand pounds in Clementinas name as well
as her own but she had lived wastefully since she had come abroad and
little money remained to be taken up With the letter Clementina handed
the viceconsul the roll of Italian and Austrian banknotes which she had
drawn when Mrs Lander decided to leave Venice they were to the amount
of several thousand lire and golden She offered them with the
insensibility to the quality of money which so many women have and which
is always so astonishing to men What must I do with these she asked

Why keep them returned the viceconsul on the spur of his surprise

I dont know as I should have any right to said Clementina They were
hers

Why butThe viceconsul began his protest but he could not end it
logically and he did not end it at all He insisted with Clementina that
she had a right to some money which Mrs Lander had given her during her
life he took charge of the banknotes in the interest of the possible
heirs and gave her his receipt for them In the meantime he felt that he
ought to ask her what she expected to do

I think she said I will stay in Venice awhile

The viceconsul suppressed any surprise he might have felt at a decision
given with mystifying cheerfulness He answered Well that was right
and for the second time he asked her if there was anything he could do
for her

Why yes she returned I should like to stay on in the house here if
you could speak for me to the padrone

I dont see why you shouldnt if we can make the padrone understand
its different

You mean about the price The viceconsul nodded Thats what I want
you should speak to him about Mr Bennam if you would Tell him that I
havent got but a little money now and he would have to make it very
reasonable That is if you think it would be right for me to stay afta
the way he tried to treat Mrs Lander

The viceconsul gave the point some thought and decided that the
attempted extortion need not make any difference with Clementina if she
could get the right terms He said he did not believe the padrone was a
bad fellow but he liked to take advantage of a stranger when he could
we all did When he came to talk with him he found him a man of heart if
not of conscience He entered into the case with the prompt intelligence
and vivid sympathy of his race and he made it easy for Clementina to
stay till she had heard from her friends in America For himself and for
his wife he professed that she could not stay too long and they
proposed that if it would content the signorina still further they would
employ Maddalena as chambermaid till she wished to return to Florence
she had offered to remain if the signorina stayed

Then that is settled said Clementina with a sigh of relief and she
thanked the viceconsul for his offer to write to the Milrays for her
and said that she would rather write herself

She meant to write as soon as she heard from Mr Hinkle which could not
be long now for then she could be independent of the offers of help
which she dreaded from Miss Milray even more than from Mrs Milray it
would be harder to refuse them and she entered upon a passage of her
life which a nature less simple would have found much more trying But
she had the power of taking everything as if it were as much to be
expected as anything else If nothing at all happened she accepted the
situation with implicit resignation and with a gayety of heart which
availed her long and never wholly left her

While the suspense lasted she could not write home as frankly as before
and she sent off letters to Middlemount which treated of her delay in
Venice with helpless reticence They would have set another sort of
household intolerably wondering and suspecting but she had the comfort
of knowing that her father would probably settle the whole matter by
saying that she would tell what she meant when she got round to it and
apart from this she had mainly the comfort of the viceconsuls society
He had little to do besides looking after her and he employed himself
about this in daily visits which the padrone and his wife regarded as
official and promoted with a serious respect for the viceconsular
dignity If the visits ended as they often did in a turn on the Grand
Canal and an ice in the Piazza they appealed to the imagination of more
sophisticated witnesses who decided that the young American girl had
inherited the millions of the sick lady and become the betrothed of the
viceconsul and that they were thus passing the days of their engagement
in conformity to the American custom however much at variance with that
of other civilizations

This view of the affair was known to Maddalena but not to Clementina
who in those days went back in many things to the tradition of her life
at Middlemount The viceconsul was of a tradition almost as simple and
his longer experience set no very wide interval between them It quickly
came to his telling her all about his dead wife and his married
daughters and how after his home was broken up he thought he would
travel a little and see what that would do for him He confessed that it
had not done much he was always homesick and he was ready to go as soon
as the President sent out a consul to take his job off his hands He said
that he had not enjoyed himself so much since he came to Venice as he was
doing now and that he did not know what he should do if Clementina first
got her call home He betrayed no curiosity as to the peculiar
circumstances of her stay but affected to regard it as something quite
normal and he watched over her in every way with a fatherly as well as
an official vigilance which never degenerated into the semblance of any
other feeling Clementina rested in his care in entire security The
world had quite fallen from her or so much of it as she had seen at
Florence and in her indifference she lapsed into life as it was in the
time before that with a tender renewal of her allegiance to it There was
nothing in the conversation of the viceconsul to distract her from this
and she said and did the things at Venice that she used to do at
Middlemount as nearly as she could to make the days of waiting pass
more quickly she tried to serve herself in ways that scandalized the
proud affection of Maddalena It was not fit for the signorina to make
her bed or sweep her room she might sew and knit if she would but these
other things were for servants like herself She continued in the faith
of Clementinas gentility and saw her always as she had seen her first
in the brief hour of her social splendor in Florence Clementina tried to
make her understand how she lived at Middlemount but she only brought
before Maddalena the humiliating image of a contadina which she rejected
not only in Clementinas behalf but that of Miss Milray She told her
that she was laughing at her and she was fixed in her belief when the
girl laughed at that notion Her poverty she easily conceived of plenty
of signorine in Italy were poor and she protected her in it with the
duty she did not divide quite evenly between her and the padrone

The date which Clementina had fixed for hearing from Hinkle by cable had
long passed and the time when she first hoped to hear from him by letter
had come and gone Her address was with the viceconsul as Mrs Landers
had been and he could not be ignorant of her disappointment when he
brought her letters which she said were from home On the surface of
things it could only be from home that she wished to hear but beneath
the surface he read an anxiety which mounted with each gratification of
this wish He had not seen much of the girl while Hinkle was in Venice
Mrs Lander had not begun to make such constant use of him until Hinkle
had gone Mrs Milray had told him of Clementinas earlier romance and
it was to Gregory that the viceconsul related the anxiety which he knew
as little in its nature as in its object

Clementina never doubted the good faith or constancy of her lover but
her heart misgave her as to his wellbeing when it sank at each failure
of the viceconsul to bring her a letter from him Something must have
happened to him and it must have been something very serious to keep him
from writing or there was some mistake of the postoffice The
viceconsul indulged himself in personal inquiries to make sure that the
mistake was not in the Venetian postoffice but he saw that he brought
her greater distress in ascertaining the fact He got to dreading a look
of resolute cheerfulness that came into her face when he shook his head
in sign that there were no letters and he suffered from the covert
eagerness with which she glanced at the superscriptions of those he
brought and failed to find the hopedfor letter among them Ordeal for
ordeal he was beginning to regret his trials under Mrs Lander In them
he could at least demand Clementinas sympathy but against herself this
was impossible Once she noted his mute distress at hers and broke into
a little laugh that he found very harrowing

I guess you hate it almost as much as I do Mr Bennam

I guess I do Ive half a mind to write the letter you want myself

Ive half a mind to let youor the letter Id like to write

It had come to her thinking she would write again to Hinkle but she
could not bring herself to do it She often imagined doing it she had
every word of such a letter in her mind and she dramatized every fact
concerning it from the time she should put pen to paper to the time when
she should get back the answer that cleared the mystery of his silence
away The fond reveries helped her to bear her suspense they helped to
make the days go by to ease the doubt with which she lay down at night
and the heartsick hope with which she rose up in the morning

One day at the hour of his wonted visit she saw the viceconsul from
her balcony coming as it seemed to her with another figure in his
gondola and a thousand conjectures whirled through her mind and then
centred upon one idea After the first glance she kept her eyes down and
would not look again while she told herself incessantly that it could not
be and that she was a fool and a goose and a perfect coot to think of
such a thing for a single moment When she allowed herself or forced
herself to look a second time as the boat drew near she had to cling
to the balcony parapet for support in her disappointment

The person whom the viceconsul helped out of the gondola was an elderly
man like himself and she took a last refuge in the chance that he might
be Hinkles father sent to bring her to him because he could not come to
her or to soften some terrible news to her Then her fancy fluttered and
fell and she waited patiently for the fact to reveal itself There was
something countrified in the figure of the man and something clerical in
his face though there was nothing in his uncouth best clothes that
confirmed this impression In both face and figure there was a vague
resemblance to some one she had seen before when the viceconsul said

Miss Claxon I want to introduce the Rev Mr James B Orson of
Michigan Mr Orson took Clementinas hand into a dry rough grasp
while he peered into her face with small shy eyes The viceconsul added
with a kind of official formality Mr Orson is the halfnephew of Mr
Lander and then Clementina now knew whom it was that he resembled He
has come to Venice continued the viceconsul at the request of Mrs
Lander and he did not know of her death until I informed him of the
fact I should have said that Mr Orson is the son of Mr Landers
halfsister He can tell you the balance himself The viceconsul
pronounced the concluding word with a certain distaste and the effect of
gladly retiring into the background

Wont you sit down said Clementina and she added with one of the
remnants of her Middlemount breeding Wont you let me take your hat

Mr Orson in trying to comply with both her invitations knocked his well
worn silk hat from the hand that held it and sent it rolling across the
room where Clementina pursued it and put it on the table

I may as well say at once he began in a flat irresonant voice that I
am the representative of Mrs Landers heirs and that I have a letter
from her enclosing her last will and testament which I have shown to the
consul here

Viceconsul the dignitary interrupted with an effect of rejecting any
part in the affair

Viceconsul I should sayand I wish to lay them both before you in
order that

Oh that is all right said Clementina sweetly Im glad there is a
will I was afraid there wasnt any at all Mr Bennam and I looked for
it everywhee She smiled upon the Rev Mr Orson who silently handed
her a paper It was the will which Milray had written for Mrs Lander
and which with whatever crazy motive she had sent to her husbands
kindred It provided that each of them should be given five thousand
dollars out of the estate and that then all should go to Clementina It
was the will Mrs Lander told her she had made but she had never seen
the paper before and the legal forms hid the meaning from her so that
she was glad to have the viceconsul make it clear Then she said
tranquilly Yes that is the way I supposed it was

Mr Orson by no means shared her calm He did not lift his voice but on
the level it had taken it became agitated Mrs Lander gave me the
address of her lawyer in Boston when she sent me the will and I made a
point of calling on him when I went East to sail I dont know why she
wished me to come out to her but being sick I presume she naturally
wished to see some of her own family

He looked at Clementina as if he thought she might dispute this but she
consented at her sweetest Oh yes indeed and he went on

I found her affairs in a very different condition from what she seemed
to think The estate was mostly in securities which had not been properly
looked after and they had depreciated until they were some of them not
worth the paper they were printed on The house in Boston is mortgaged up
to its full value I should say and I should say that Mrs Lander did
not know where she stood She seemed to think that she was a very rich
woman but she lived high and her lawyer said he never could make her
understand how the money was going Mr Lander seemed to lose his grip
the year he died and engaged in some very unfortunate speculations I
dont know whether he told her I might enter into details

Oh that is not necessary said Clementina politely witless of the
disastrous quality of the facts which Mr Orson was imparting

But the sum and substance of it all is that there will not be more than
enough to pay the bequests to her own family if there is that

Clementina looked with smiling innocence at the viceconsul

That is to say he explained there wont be anything at all for you
Miss Claxon

Well thats what I always told Mrs Lander I ratha when she brought it
up I told her she ought to give it to his family said Clementina with
a satisfaction in the event which the viceconsul seemed unable to share
for he remained gloomily silent There is that last money I drew on the
letter of credit you can give that to Mr Orson

I have told him about that money said the viceconsul dryly It will
be handed over to him when the estate is settled if there isnt enough
to pay the bequests without it

And the money which Mrs Landa gave me before that she pursued
eagerly Mr Orson had the effect of pricking up his ears though it was
in fact merely a gleam of light that came into his eyes

Thats yours said the viceconsul sourly almost savagely She
didnt give it to you without she wanted you to have it and she didnt
expect you to pay her bequests with it In my opinion he burst out in
a wrathful recollection of his own sufferings from Mrs Lander she
didnt give you a millionth part of your due for all the trouble she made
you and I want Mr Orson to understand that right here

Clementina turned her impartial gaze upon Mr Orson as if to verify the
impression of this extreme opinion upon him he looked as if he neither
accepted nor rejected it and she concluded the sentence which the
viceconsul had interrupted Because I ratha not keep it if there isnt
enough without it

The viceconsul gave way to violence Its none of your business whether
theres enough or not What youve got to do is to keep what belongs to
you and Im going to see that you do Thats what Im here for If this
assumption of official authority did not awe Clementina at least it put
a check upon her headlong selfsacrifice The viceconsul strengthened
his hold upon her by asking What would you do I should like to know
if you gave that up

Oh I should get along she returned lightheartedly but upon
questioning herself whether she should turn to Miss Milray for help or
appeal to the viceconsul himself she was daunted a little and she
added But just as you say Mr Bennam

I say keep what fairly belongs to you Its only two or three hundred
dollars at the outside he explained to Mr Orsons hungry eyes but
perhaps the sum did not affect the country ministers imagination as
trifling his yearly salary must sometimes have been little more

The whole interview left the viceconsul out of humor with both parties
to the affair and as to Clementina between the ideals of a perfect
little saint and a perfect little simpleton he remained for the present
unable to class her




XXXV

Clementina and the ViceConsul afterwards agreed that Mrs Lander must
have sent the will to Mr Orson in one of those moments of suspicion when
she distrusted everyone about her or in that trouble concerning her
husbands kindred which had grown upon her more and more as a means of
assuring them that they were provided for

But even then the viceconsul concluded I dont see why she wanted
this man to come out here The only explanation is that she was a little
off her base towards the last Thats the charitable supposition

I dont think she was herself some of the time Clementina assented in
acceptance of the kindly construction

The viceconsul modified his good will toward Mrs Landers memory so far
as to say Well if shed been somebody else most of the time it would
have been an improvement

The talk turned upon Mr Orson and what he would probably do The
viceconsul had found him a cheap lodging at his request and he seemed
to have settled down at Venice either without the will or without the
power to go home but the viceconsul did not know where he ate or what
he did with himself except at the times when he came for letters Once or
twice when he looked him up he found him writing and then the minister
explained that he had promised to correspond for an organ of his sect
in the Northwest but he owned that there was no money in it He was
otherwise reticent and even furtive in his manner He did not seem to go
much about the city but kept to his own room and if he was writing of
Venice it must have been chiefly from his acquaintance with the little
court into which his windows looked He affected the viceconsul as
forlorn and helpless and he pitied him and rather liked him as a
fellowvictim of Mrs Lander

One morning Mr Orson came to see Clementina and after a brief passage
of opinion upon the weather he fell into an embarrassed silence from
which he pulled himself at last with a visible effort I hardly know how
to lay before you what I have to say Miss Claxon he began and I must
ask you to put the best construction upon it I have never been reduced
to a similar distress before You would naturally think that I would turn
to the viceconsul on such an occasion but I feel through our relation
to theto Mrs Landerahsomewhat more at home with you

He stopped as if he wished to be asked his business and she entreated
him Why what is it Mr Osson Is there something I can do There
isnt anything I wouldnt

A gleam watery and faint which still could not be quite winked away
came into his small eyes Why the fact is could youahadvance me
about five dollars

Why Mr Orson she began and he seemed to think she wished to
withdraw her offer of help for he interposed

I will repay it as soon as I get an expected remittance from home I
came out on the invitation of Mrs Lander and as her guest and I
supposed

Oh dont say a wod cried Clementina but now that he had begun he
was powerless to stop

I would not ask but my landlady has pressed me for her rentI suppose
she needs itand I have been reduced to the last copper

The girl whose eyes the tears of self pity so rarely visited broke into
a sob that seemed to surprise her visitor But she checked herself as
with a quick inspiration Have you been to breakfast

Wellahnot this morning Mr Orson admitted as if to imply that
having breakfasted some other morning might be supposed to serve the
purpose

She left him and ran to the door Maddalena Maddalena she called and
Maddalena responded with a frightened voice from the direction of the
kitchen

Vengo subito

She hurried out with the coffeepot in her hand as if she had just taken
it up when Clementina called and she halted for the whispered colloquy
between them which took place before she set it down on the table already
laid for breakfast then she hurried out of the room again She came back
with a cantaloupe and grapes and cold ham and put them before
Clementina and her guest who both ignored the hunger with which he swept
everything before him When his famine had left nothing he said in
decorous compliment

That is very good coffee I should think the genuine berry though I am
told that they adulterate coffee a great deal in Europe

Do they asked Clementina I didnt know it

She left him still sitting before the table and came back with some
banknotes in her hand Are you sure you hadnt betta take moa she
asked

I think that five dollars will be all that I shall require he
answered with dignity I should be unwilling to accept more I shall
undoubtedly receive some remittances soon

Oh I know you will Clementina returned and she added I am waiting
for lettas myself I dont think any one ought to give up

The preacher ignored the appeal which was in her tone rather than her
words and went on to explain at length the circumstances of his having
come to Europe so unprovided against chances When he wished to excuse
his imprudence she cried out Oh dont say a wod Its just like my
own fatha and she told him some things of her home which apparently did
not interest him very much He had a kind of dull cold selfabsorption
in which he was indeed so little like her father that only her kindness
for the lonely man could have justified her in thinking there was any
resemblance

She did not see him again for a week and meantime she did not tell the
viceconsul of what had happened But an anxiety for the minister began
to mingle with her anxieties for herself she constantly wondered why she
did not hear from her lover and she occasionally wondered whether Mr
Orson were not falling into want again She had decided to betray his
condition to the viceconsul when he came bringing the money she had
lent him He had received a remittance from an unexpected source and he
hoped she would excuse his delay in repaying her loan She wished not to
take the money at least till he was quite sure he should not want it
but he insisted

I have enough to keep me now till I hear from other sources with the
means for returning home I see no object in continuing here under the
circumstances

In the relief which she felt for him Clementinas heart throbbed with a
pain which was all for herself Why should she wait any longer either
For that instant she abandoned the hope which had kept her up so long a
wave of homesickness overwhelmed her

I should like to go back too she said I dont see why Im staying

Mr Osson why cant you let meshe was going to saygo home with
you But she really said what was also in her heart Why cant you let
me give you the money to go home It is all Mrs Landas money anyway

There is certainly that view of the matter he assented with a
promptness that might have suggested a lurking grudge for the
viceconsuls decision that she ought to keep the money Mrs Lander had
given her

But Clementina urged unsuspiciously Oh yes indeed And I shall feel
better if you take it I only wish I could go home too

The minister was silent while he was revolving with whatever scruple or
reluctance a compromise suitable to the occasion Then he said Why
should we not return together

Would you take me she entreated

That should be as you wished I am not much acquainted with the usages
in such matters but I presume that it would be entirely practicable We
could ask the viceconsul

Yes

He must have had considerable experience in cases of the kind Would
your friends meet you in New York or

I dont know said Clementina with a pang for the thought of a meeting
she had sometimes fancied there when her lover had come out for her and
her father had been told to come and receive them No she sighed
thee wouldnt be time to let them know But it wouldnt make any
difference I could get home from New Yok alone she added listlessly
Her spirits had fallen again She saw that she could not leave Venice
till she had heard in some sort from the letter she had written Perhaps
it couldnt be done after all But I will see Mr Bennam about it Mr
Osson and I know he will want you to have that much of the money He
will be coming hee soon

He rose upon what he must have thought her hint and said I should not
wish to have him swayed against his judgment

The viceconsul came not long after the minister had left her and she
began upon what she wished to do for him

The viceconsul was against it I would rather lend him the money out of
my own pocket How are you going to get along yourself if you let him
have so much

She did not answer at once Then she said hopelessly Ive a great mind
to go home with him I dont believe theres any use waiting here any
longa The viceconsul could not say anything to this She added Yes
I believe I will go home We wee talking about it the other day and he
is willing to let me go with him

I should think he would be the viceconsul retorted in his indignation
for her Did you offer to pay for his passage

Yes she owned I did and again the viceconsul could say nothing
If I went it wouldnt make any difference whether it took it all or
not I should have plenty to get home from New York with

Well the viceconsul assented dryly its for you to say

I know you dont want me to do it

Well I shall miss you he answered evasively

And I shall miss you too Mr Bennam Dont you believe it But if I
dont take this chance to get home I dont know when I shall eva have
anotha And there isnt any use waitingno there isnt

The viceconsul laughed at the sort of imperative despair in her tone
How are you going Which way I mean

They counted up Clementinas debts and assets and they found that if she
took the next steamer from Genoa which was to sail in four days she
would have enough to pay her own way and Mr Orsons to New York and
still have some thirty dollars over for her expenses home to
Middlemount They allowed for a second cabinpassage which the
viceconsul said was perfectly good on the Genoa steamers He rather
urged the gentility and comfort of the second cabinpassage but his
reasons in favor of it were wasted upon Clementinas indifference she
wished to get home now and she did not care how She asked the
viceconsul to see the minister for her and if he were ready and
willing to telegraph for their tickets He transacted the business so
promptly that he was able to tell her when he came in the evening that
everything was in train He excused his coming he said that now she was
going so soon he wanted to see all he could of her He offered no excuse
when he came the next morning but he said he had got a letter for her
and thought she might want to have it at once

He took it out of his hat and gave it to her It was addressed in
Hinkles writing her answer had come at last she stood trembling with
it in her hand

The viceconsul smiled Is that the one

Yes she whispered back

All right He took his hat and set it on the back of his head before
he left her without other salutation

Then Clementina opened her letter It was in a womans hand and the
writer made haste to explain at the beginning that she was George W
Hinkles sister and that she was writing for him for though he was now
out of danger he was still very weak and they had all been anxious
about him A month before he had been hurt in a railroad collision and
had come home from the West where the accident happened suffering
mainly from shock as his doctor thought he had taken to his bed at
once and had not risen from it since He had been out of his head a
great part of the time and had been forbidden everything that could
distress or excite him His sister said that she was writing for him now
as soon as he had seen Clementinas letter it had been forwarded from
one address to another and had at last found him there at his home in
Ohio He wished to say that he would come out for Clementina as soon as
he was allowed to undertake the journey and in the meantime she must let
him know constantly where she was The letter closed with a few words of
love in his own handwriting

Clementina rose from reading it and put on her hat in a bewildered
impulse to go to him at once she knew in spite of all the cautions and
reserves of the letter that he must still be very sick When she came out
of her daze she found that she could only go to the viceconsul She put
the letter in his hands to let it explain itself Youll undastand
now she said What shall I do

When he had read it he smiled and answered I guess I understood pretty
well before though I wasnt posted on names Well I suppose youll want
to layout most of your capital on cables now

Yes she laughed and then she suddenly lamented Why didnt they
telegraph

Well I guess he hadnt the head for it said the viceconsul and the
rest wouldnt think of it They wouldnt in the country

Clementina laughed again in joyous recognition of the fact No my
fatha wouldnt eitha

The viceconsul reached for his hat and he led the way to Clementinas
gondola at his garden gate in greater haste than she At the telegraph
office he framed a dispatch which for expansive fullness and precision
was apparently unexampled in the experience of the clerk who took it and
spelt over its English with them It asked an answer in the viceconsuls
care and Ill tell you what Miss Claxon he said with a husky
weakness in his voice I wish youd let this be my treat

She understood Do you really Mr Bennam

I do indeed

Well then I will she said but when he wished to include in his
treat the dispatch she sent home to her father announcing her coming she
would not let him

He looked at his watch as they rowed away Its eight oclock here
now and it will reach Ohio about six hours earlier but you cant expect
an answer tonight you know

NoShe had expected it though he could see that

But whenever it comes Ill bring it right round to you Now its all
going to be straight dont you be afraid and youre going home the
quickest way you can get there Ive been looking up the sailings and
this Genoa boat will get you to New York about as soon as any could from
Liverpool Besides theres always a chance of missing connections and
losing time between here and England I should stick to the Genoa boat

Oh I shall said Clementina far less fidgetted than he She was in
fact resting securely again in the faith which had never really deserted
her and had only seemed for a little time to waver from her when her
hope went Now that she had telegraphed her heart was at peace and she
even laughed as she answered the anxious viceconsul




XXXVI

The next morning Clementina watched for the viceconsul from her balcony
She knew he would not send she knew he would come but it was nearly
noon before she saw him coming They caught sight of each other almost at
the same moment and he stood up in his boat and waved something white
in his hand which must be a dispatch for her

It acknowledged her telegram and reported George still improving his
father would meet her steamer in New York It was very reassuring it was
every thing hopeful but when she had read it she gave it to the
viceconsul for encouragement

Its all right Miss Claxon he said stoutly Dont you be troubled
about Mr Hinkles not coming to meet you himself He cant keep too
quiet for a while yet

Oh yes said Clementina patiently

If you really want somebody to worry about you can help Mr Orson to
worry about himself the viceconsul went on with the grimness he had
formerly used in speaking of Mrs Lander Hes sick or he thinks hes
going to be He sent round for me this morning and I found him in bed
You may have to go home alone But I guess hes more scared than hurt

Her heart sank and then rose in revolt against the mere idea of delay
I wonder if I ought to go and see him she said

Well it would be a kindness returned the viceconsul with a
promptness that unmasked the apprehension he felt for the sick man

He did not offer to go with her and she took Maddalena She found the
minister seated in his chair beside his bed A three days beard
heightened the gauntness of his face he did not move when his padrona
announced her

I am not any better he answered when she said that she was glad to see
him up I am merely resting the bed is hard I regret to say he
added with a sort of formal impersonality that I shall be unable to
accompany you home Miss Claxon That is if you still think of taking
the steamer this week

Her whole being had set homeward in a tide that already seemed to drift
the vessel from its moorings Whatwhat do you mean she gasped

I didnt know he returned but that in view of the circumstancesall
the circumstancesyou might be intending to defer your departure to some
later steamer

No no no I must go now I couldnt wait a day an hour a minute
after the first chance of going You dont know what you are saying He
might die if I told him I was not coming and then what should I do
This was what Clementina said to herself but what she said to Mr Orson
with an inspiration from her terror at his suggestion was Dont you
think a little chicken broth would do you good Mr Osson I dont
believe but what it would

A wistful gleam came into the preachers eyes It might he admitted
and then she knew what must be his malady She sent Maddalena to a
trattoria for the soup and she did not leave him even after she had
seen its effect upon him It was not hard to persuade him that he had
better come home with her and she had him there tucked away with his
few poor belongings in the most comfortable room the padrone could
imagine when the viceconsul came in the evening

He says he thinks he can go now she ended when she had told the
viceconsul And I know he can It wasnt anything but poor living

It looks more like no living said the viceconsul Why didnt the old
fool let some one know that he was short of money He went on with a
partial transfer of his contempt of the preacher to her I suppose if
hed been sick instead of hungry youd have waited over till the next
steamer for him

She cast down her eyes I dont know what youll think of me I should
have been sorry for him and I should have wanted to stay She lifted
her eyes and looked the viceconsul defiantly in the face But he hadnt
the fust claim on me and I should have goneI couldnt have helped
itI should have gone if he had been dying

Well youve got more horsesense said the viceconsul than any ten
men I ever saw and he testified his admiration of her by putting his
arms round her where she stood before him and kissing her Dont you
mind he explained If my youngest girl had lived she would have been
about your age

Oh its all right Mr Bennam said Clementina

When the time came for them to leave Venice Mr Orson was even eager to
go The viceconsul would have gone with them in contempt of the official
responsibilities which he felt to be such a thankless burden but there
was really no need of his going and he and Clementina treated the
question with the matteroffact impartiality which they liked in each
other He saw her off at the station where Maddalena had come to take the
train for Florence in token of her devotion to the signorina whom she
would not outstay in Venice She wept long and loud upon Clementinas
neck so that even Clementina was once moved to put her handkerchief to
her tearless eyes

At the last moment she had a question which she referred to the vice
consul Should you tell him she asked

Tell who what he retorted

Mr Ossonthat I wouldnt have stayed for him

Do you think it would make you feel any better asked the consul upon
reflection

I believe he ought to know

Well then I guess I should do it

The time did not come for her confession till they had nearly reached the
end of their voyage It followed upon something like a confession from
the minister himself which he made the day he struggled on deck with her
help after spending a week in his berth

Here is something he said which appears to be for you Miss Claxon
I found it among some letters for Mrs Lander which Mr Bennam gave me
after my arrival and I only observed the address in looking over the
papers in my valise this morning He handed her a telegram I trust
that it is nothing requiring immediate attention

Clementina read it at a glance No she answered and for a while she
could not say anything more it was a cable message which Hinkles sister
must have sent her after writing No evil had come of its failure to
reach her and she recalled without bitterness the suffering which would
have been spared her if she had got it before It was when she thought of
the suffering of her lover from the silence which must have made him
doubt her that she could not speak As soon as she governed herself
against her first resentment she said with a little sigh It is all
right now Mr Osson and her stress upon the word seemed to trouble
him with no misgiving Besides if youre to blame for not noticing so
is Mr Bennam and I dont want to blame any one She hesitated a moment
before she added I have got to tell you something now because I think
you ought to know it I am going home to be married Mr Osson and this
message is from the gentleman I am going to be married to He has been
very sick and I dont know yet as hell be able to meet me in New Yok
but his fatha will

Mr Orson showed no interest in these facts beyond a silent attention to
her words which might have passed for an open indifference At his time
of life all such questions which are of permanent importance to women
affect men hardly more than the angels who neither marry nor are given in
marriage Besides as a minister he must have had a surfeit of all
possible qualities in the love affairs of people intending matrimony As
a casuist he was more reasonably concerned in the next fact which
Clementina laid before him

And the otha day there in Venice when you wee sick and you seemed to
think that I might put off stahting home till the next steamer I dont
know but I let you believe I would

I supposed that the delay of a week or two could make no material
difference to you

But now you see that it would And I feel as if I ought to tell youI
spoke to Mr Bennam about it and he didnt tell me not tothat I
shouldnt have staid no not for anything in the wold I had to do what
I did at the time but eva since it has seemed as if I had deceived you
and I dont want to have it seem so any longer It isnt because I dont
hate to tell you I do but I guess if it was to happen over again I
couldnt feel any different Do you want I should tell the deckstewahd
to bring you some beeftea

I think I could relish a small portion said Mr Orson cautiously and
he said nothing more

Clementina left him with her nerves in a flutter and she did not come
back to him until she decided that it was time to help him down to his
cabin He suffered her to do this in silence but at the door he cleared
his throat and began

I have reflected upon what you told me and I have tried to regard the
case from all points I believe that I have done so without personal
feeling and I think it my duty to say fully and freely that I believe
you would have done perfectly right not to remain

Yes said Clementina I thought you would think so

They parted emotionlessly to all outward effect and when they met again
it was without a sign of having passed through a crisis of sentiment
Neither referred to the matter again but from that time the minister
treated Clementina with a deference not without some shadows of
tenderness such as her helplessness in Venice had apparently never
inspired She had cast out of her mind all lingering hardness toward him
in telling him the hard truth and she met his faint relentings with a
grateful gladness which showed itself in her constant care of him

This helped her a little to forget the strain of the anxiety that
increased upon her as the time shortened between the last news of her
lover and the next and there was perhaps no more exaggeration in the
import than in the terms of the formal acknowledgment which Mr Orson
made her as their steamer sighted Fire Island Light and they both knew
that their voyage had ended I may not be able to say to you in the
hurry of our arrival in New York that I am obliged to you for a good many
little attentions which I should be pleased to reciprocate if
opportunity offered I do not think I am going too far in saying that
they are such as a daughter might offer a parent

Oh dont speak of it Mr Osson she protested I havent done
anything that any one wouldnt have done

I presume said the minister thoughtfully as if retiring from an
extreme position that they are such as others similarly circumstanced
might have done but it will always be a source of satisfaction for you
to reflect that you have not neglected them




XXXVII

In the crowd which thronged the steamers dock at Hoboken Clementina
strained her eyes to make out some one who looked enough like her lover
to be his father and she began to be afraid that they might miss each
other when she failed She walked slowly down the gangway with the
people that thronged it glad to be hidden by them from her failure but
at the last step she was caught aside by a small blackeyed blackhaired
woman who called out Isnt this Miss Claxon Im Georrges sisterr Oh
yourre just like what he said I knew it I knew it and then hugged
her and kissed her and passed her to the little lean dark old man next
her This is fatherr I knew you couldnt tell us because I take afterr
him and Georrge is exactly like motherr

Georges father took her hand timidly but found courage to say to his
daughter Hadnt you betterr let her own fatherr have a chance at herr
and amidst a tempest of apologies and self blame from the sister Claxon
showed himself over the shoulders of the little man

Why there want no hurry as long as shes hea he said in prompt
enjoyment of the joke and he and Clementina sparely kissed each other

Why fatha she said I didnt expect you to come to New Yok to meet
me

Well I didnt hadly expect it myself but Id neva been to Yok and I
thought I might as well come Things ah ratha slack at home just now
anyway

She did not heed his explanation Wee you scaed when you got my
dispatch

No we kind of expected youd come any time the way you wrote afta Mrs
Landa died We thought something must be up

Yes she said absently Then Whees motha she asked

Well I guess she thought she couldnt get round to it exactly said
the father Shes all right Neednt ask you

No Im fustrate Clementina returned with a silent joy in her
fathers face and voice She went back in it to the girl of a year ago
and the world which had come between them since their parting rolled away
as if it had never been there

Neither of them said anything about that She named over her brothers and
sisters and he answered Yes yes in assurance of their wellbeing
and then he explained as if that were the only point of real interest
I see your folks waitin hee fo somebody and I thought Id see if it
want the same one and we kind of struck up an acquaintance on your
account befoe you got hee Clem

Your folks she silently repeated to herself Yes they ah mine and
she stood trying to realize the strange fact while Georges sister
poured out a voluminous comment upon Claxons spare statement and
Georges father admired her volubility with the shut smile of toothless
age She spoke with the burr which the ScotchIrish settlers have
imparted to the whole middle West but it was music to Clementina who
heard now and then a tone of her lover in his sisters voice In the
midst of it all she caught sight of a mute unfriended figure just without
their circle his traveling shawl hanging loose upon his shoulders and
the valise which had formed his sole baggage in the voyage to and from
Europe pulling his long hand out of his coat sleeve

Oh yes she said here is Mr Osson that came ova with me fatha
hes a relation of Mr Landas and she presented him to them all

He shifted his valise to the left hand and shook hands with each
asking What name and then fell motionless again

Well said her father I guess this is the end of this paht of the
ceremony and Im goin to see your baggage through the customhouse
Clementina Ive read about it and I want to know how its done I want
to see what you ah tryin to smuggle in

I guess you wont find much she said But youll want the keys wont
you She called to him as he was stalking away

Well I guess that would be a good idea Want to help Miss Hinkle

I guess we might as well all help said Clementina and Mr Orson
included himself in the invitation He seemed unable to separate himself
from them though the passage of Clementinas baggage through the
customs and its delivery to an expressman for the hotel where the
Hinkles said they were staying might well have severed the last tie
between them

Ah you going straight home Mr Osson she asked to rescue him from
the forgetfulness into which they were all letting him fall

I think I will remain over a day he answered I may go on to Boston
before starting West

Well thats right said Clementinas father with the wish to approve
everything native to him and an instinctive sense of Clementinas wish
to befriend the minister Betta come to oua hotel Were all goin to
the same one

I presume it is a good one Mr Orson assented

Well said Claxon you must make Miss Hinkle hea stand it if it
aint Shes got me to go to it

Mr Orson apparently could not enter into the joke but he accompanied
the party which again began to forget him across the ferry and up the
elevated road to the street car that formed the last stage of their
progress to the hotel At this point Georges sister fell silent and
Clementinas father burst out Look hea I guess we betta not keep this
up any longa I dont believe much in supprises and I guess she betta
know it now

He looked at Georges sister as if for authority to speak further and
Clementina looked at her too while Georges father nervously moistened
his smiling lips with the tip of his tongue and let his twinkling eyes
rest upon Clementinas face

Is he at the hotel she asked

Yes said his sister monosyllabic for once

I knew it said Clementina and she was only half aware of the fullness
with which his sister now explained how he wanted to come so much that
the doctor thought he had better but that they had made him promise he
would not try to meet her at the steamer lest it should be too great a
trial of his strength

Yes Clementina assented when the story came to an end and was
beginning over again

She had an inexplicable moment when she stood before her lover in the
room where they left her to meet him alone She faltered and he waited
constrained by her constraint

Is it all a mistake Clementina he asked with a piteous smile

No no

Am I so much changed

No you are looking better than I expected

And you are not sorryfor anything

No I amPerhaps I have thought of you too much It seems so strange

I understand he answered We have been like spirits to each other
and now we find that we are alive and on the earth like other people and
we are not used to it

It must be something like that

But if its something elseif you have the least regretif you would
ratherHe stopped and they remained looking at each other a moment
Then she turned her head and glanced out of the window as if something
there had caught her sight

Its a very pleasant view isnt it she said and she lifted her hands
to her head and took off her hat with an effect of having got home
after absence to stay




XXXVIII

It was possibly through some sense finer than any cognition that
Clementina felt in meeting her lover that she had taken up a new burden
rather than laid down an old one Afterwards when they once recurred to
that meeting and she tried to explain for him the hesitation which she
had not been able to hide she could only say I presume I didnt want
to begin unless I was sure I could carry out It would have been silly

Her confession if it was a confession was made when one of his returns
to health or rather one of the arrests of his unhealth flushed them
with hope and courage but before that first meeting was ended she knew
that he had overtasked his strength in coming to New York and he must
not try it further Fatha she said to Claxon with the authority of a
woman doing her duty Im not going to let Geoge go up to Middlemount
with all the excitement It will be as much as he can do to get home You
can tell mother about it and the rest I did suppose it would be Mr
Richling that would marry us and I always wanted him to but I guess
somebody else can do it as well

Just as you say Clem her father assented Why not Brother Osson
hea he suggested with a pleasure in the joke whatever it was that
the ministers relation to Clementina involved I guess he can put off
his visit to Boston long enough

Well I was thinking of him said Clementina Will you ask him

Yes Ill get round to it in the mohning

Nonow right away Ive been talking with Geoge about it and thees
no sense in putting it off I ought to begin taking care of him at once

Well I guess when I tell your motha how youre layin hold she wont
think its the same pusson said her father proudly

But it is I havent changed a bit

You hant changed for the wohse anyway

Didnt I always try to do what I had to

I guess you did Clem

Well then

Mr Orson after a decent hesitation consented to perform the ceremony
It took place in a parlor of the hotel according to the law of New York
which facilitates marriage so greatly in all respects that it is strange
any one in the State should remain single He had then a luxury of choice
between attaching himself to the bridal couple as far as Ohio on his
journey home to Michigan or to Claxon who was going to take the boat for
Boston the next day on his way to Middlemount He decided for Claxon
since he could then see Mrs Landers lawyer at once and arrange with
him for getting out of the viceconsuls hands the money which he was
holding for an authoritative demand He accepted without open reproach
the handsome fee which the elder Hinkle gave him for his services and
even went so far as to say If your son should ever be blest with a
return to health he has got a helpmeet such as there are very few of
He then admonished the young couple in whatever trials life should have
in store for them to be resigned and always to be prepared for the
worst When he came later to take leave of them he was apparently not
equal to the task of fitly acknowledging the return which Hinkle made him
of all the money remaining to Clementina out of the sum last given her by
Mrs Lander but he hid any disappointment he might have suffered and
with a brief Thank you put it in his pocket

Hinkle told Clementina of the apathetic behavior of Mr Orson he added
with a laugh like his old self Its the best that he doesnt seem
prepared for

Yes she assented He wasnt very cheeful But I presume that he
meant well It must be a trial for him to find out that Mrs Landa wasnt
rich after all

It was apparently never a trial to her She went to Ohio with her husband
and took up her life on the farm where it was wisely judged that he had
the best chance of working out of the wreck of his health and strength
There was often the promise and always the hope of this and their love
knew no doubt of the future Her sistersinlaw delighted in all her
strangeness and difference while they petted her as something not to be
separated from him in their petting of their brother to his mother she
was the darling which her youngest had never ceased to be Clementina
once went so far as to say to him that if she was ever anything she would
like to be a Moravian

The question of religion was always related in their minds to the
question of Gregory to whom they did justice in their trust of each
other It was Hinkle himself who reasoned out that if Gregory was narrow
his narrowness was of his conscience and not of his heart or his mind
She respected the memory of her first lover but it was as if he were
dead now as well as her young dream of him and she read with a curious
sense of remoteness a paragraph which her husband found in the religious
intelligence of his Sunday paper announcing the marriage of the Rev
Frank Gregory to a lady described as having been a frequent and bountiful
contributor to the foreign missions She was apparently a widow and they
conjectured that she was older than he His departure for his chosen
field of missionary labor in China formed part of the news communicated
by the rather exulting paragraph

Well that is all right said Clementinas husband He is a good man
and he is where he can do nothing but good I am glad I neednt feel
sorry for him any more

Clementinas father must have given such a report of Hinkle and his
family that they felt easy at home in leaving her to the lot she had
chosen When Claxon parted from her he talked of coming out with her
mother to see her that fall but it was more than a year before they got
round to it They did not come till after the birth of her little girl
and her father then humorously allowed that perhaps they would not have
got round to it at all if something of the kind had not happened The
Hinkles and her father and mother liked one another so much that in the
first glow of his enthusiasm Claxon talked of settling down in Ohio and
the older Hinkle drove him about to look at some places that were for
sale But it ended in his saying one day that he missed the hills and he
did not believe that he would know enough to come in when it rained if he
did not see old Middlemount with his nightcap on first His wife and he
started home with the impatience of their years rather earlier than they
had meant to go and they were silent for a little while after they left
the flagstation where Hinkle and Clementina had put them aboard their
train

Well said Claxon at last

Well echoed his wife and then she did not speak for a little while
longer At last she asked

Dhe look that way when you fust see him in New Yok

Claxon gave his honesty time to get the better of his optimism Even then
he answered evasively He doos look pootty slim

The way I cypher it out said his wife he no business to let her
marry him if he want goin to get well It was throwin of herself
away as you may say

I dont know about that said Claxon as if the point had occurred to
him too and had been already argued in his mind I guess they must a
had it out there in New York before they got marriedor she had I
dont believe but what he expected to get well right away Its the kind
of a thing that lingas along and lingas along As fah foth as Clem
went I guess there want any let about it I guess shed made up her
mind from the staht and she was goin to have him if she had to hold him
on his feet to do it Look hea What would you done

Oh I presume were all fools said Mrs Claxon impatient of a sex not
always so frank with itself But that dont excuse him

I dont say it doos her husband admitted But I presume he was
expectin to get well right away then And I dont believe he added
energetically but what he will yet As I undastand there aint
anything ogganic about him Its just this hee nuvvous prostration
resultin from shock his docta tells me and hell wok out of that all
right

They said no more and Mrs Claxon did not recur to any phase of the
situation till she undid the lunch which the Hinkles had put up for them
and laid out on the napkin in her lap the portions of cold ham and cold
chicken the buttered biscuit and the little pot of applebutter with
the large bottle of cold coffee Then she sighed They live well

Yes said her husband glad of any concession and they ah good
folks And Clems as happy as a bud with em you can see that

Oh she was always happy enough if thats all you want I presume she
was happy with that hectorin old thing that fooled her out of her
money

I hant ever regretted that money Rebecca said Claxon stiffly
almost sternly and I guess you ant eitha

I dont say I have retorted Mrs Claxon But I dont like to be made
a fool of I presume she added remotely but not so irrelevantly
Clem could ha got most anybody ova thea

Well said Claxon taking refuge in the joke I shouldnt want her to
marry a crowned head myself

It was Clementina who drove the claybank colt away from the station
after the train had passed out of sight Her husband sat beside her and
let her take the reins from his nerveless grasp and when they got into
the shelter of the piece of woods that the road passed through he put up
his hands to his face and broke into sobs She allowed him to weep on
though she kept saying Geoge Geoge softly and stroking his knee
with the hand next him When his sobbing stopped she said I guess
theyve had a pleasant visit but Im glad wea together again He took
up her hand and kissed the back of it and then clutched it hard but did
not speak Its strange she went on how I used to be homesick for
father and mothashe had sometimes lost her Yankee accent in her
association with his people and spoke with their Western burr but she
found it in moments of deeper feelingwhen I was there in Europe and
now Im glad to have them go I dont want anybody to be between us and
I want to go back to just the way we wee befoe they came Its been a
strain on you and now you must throw it all off and rest and get up
your strength One thing I could see that fatha noticed the gain you had
made since he saw you in New Yok He spoke about it to me the fust
thing and he feels just the way I do about it He dont want you to
hurry and get well but take it slowly and not excite yourself He
believes in your gleaner and he knows all about machinery He says the
patent makes it puffectly safe and you can take your own time about
pushing it its sua to go And motha liked you Shes not one to talk a
great dealshe always leaves that to father and mebut shes got deep
feelings and she just worshipped the baby I neva saw her take a child
in her ahms before but she seemed to want to hold the baby all the
time She stopped and then added tenderly Now I know what you ah
thinking about Geoge and I dont want you to think about it any more
If you do I shall give up

They had come to a bad piece of road where a slough of thick mud forced
the wagonway over the stumps of a turnout in the woods You had better
let me have the reins Clementina he said He drove home over the
yellow leaves of the hickories and the crimson leaves of the maples that
heavy with the morning dew fell slanting through the still air and on
the way he began to sing his singing made her heart ache His father
came out to put up the colt for him and Hinkle would not have his help

He unhitched the colt himself while his father trembled by with bent
knees he clapped the colt on the haunch and started him through the
pasturebars with a gay shout and then put his arm round Clementinas
waist and walked her into the kitchen amidst the grins of his mother and
sisters who said he ought to be ashamed

The winter passed and in the spring he was not so well as he had been in
the fall It was the outdoor life which was best for him and he picked
up again in the summer When another autumn came it was thought best for
him not to risk the confinement of another winter in the North The
prolongation of the summer in the South would complete his cure and
Clementina took her baby and went with him to Florida He was very well
there and courageous letters came to Middlemount and Ohio boasting of
the gains he had made One day toward spring he came in languid from the
damp unnatural heat and the next day he had a fever which the doctor
would not in a resort absolutely free from malaria pronounce malarial
After it had once declared itself in compliance with this reluctance a
simple fever Hinkle was delirious and he never knew Clementina again
for the mother of his child They were once more at Venice in his
ravings and he was reasoning with her that Belsky was not drowned

The mystery of his malady deepened into the mystery of his death With
that his look of health and youth came back and as she gazed upon his
gentle face it wore to her the smile of quaint sweetness that she had
seen it wear the first night it won her fancy at Miss Milrays horse in
Florence




XXXIX

Six years after Miss Milray parted with Clementina in Venice she found
herself towards the close of the summer at Middlemount She had
definitely ceased to live in Florence where she had meant to die and
had come home to close her eyes She was in no haste to do this and in
the meantime she was now at Middlemount with her brother who had
expressed a wish to revisit the place in memory of Mrs Milray It was
the second anniversary of her divorce which had remained after a
married life of many vicissitudes almost the only experience untried in
that relation and which had been happily accomplished in the courts of
Dacotah upon grounds that satisfied the facile justice of that State
Milray had dealt handsomely with his widow as he unresentfully called
her and the money he assigned her was of a destiny perhaps as honored as
its origin She employed it in the negotiation of a second marriage in
which she redressed the balance of her first by taking a husband somewhat
younger than herself

Both Milray and his sister had a wish which was much more than a
curiosity to know what had become of Clementina they had heard that her
husband was dead and that she had come back to Middlemount and Miss
Milray was going to the office the afternoon following their arrival to
ask the landlord about her when she was arrested at the door of the
ballroom by a sight that she thought very pretty At the bottom of the
room clearly defined against the long windows behind her stood the
figure of a lady in the middle of the floor In rows on either side sat
little girls and little boys who left their places one after another and
turned at the door to make their manners to her In response to each
obeisance the lady dropped a curtsey now to this side now to that
taking her skirt between her finger tips on either hand and spreading it
delicately with a certain elegance of movement and a grace that was
full of poetry and to Miss Milray somehow full of pathos There
remained to the end a small mite of a girl who was the last to leave her
place and bow to the lady She did not quit the room then like the
others but advanced toward the lady who came to meet her and lifted her
and clasped her to her breast with a kind of passion She walked down
toward the door where Miss Milray stood gently drifting over the
polished floor as if still moved by the music that had ceased and as
she drew near Miss Milray gave a cry of joy and ran upon her Why
Clementina she screamed and caught her and the child both in her arms

She began to weep but Clementina smiled instead of weeping as she
always used to do She returned Miss Milrays affectionate greeting with
a tenderness as great as her own but with a sort of authority such as
sometimes comes to those who have suffered She quieted the older woman
with her own serenity and met the torrent of her questions with as many
answers as their rush permitted when they were both presently in Miss
Milrays room talking in their old way From time to time Miss Milray
broke from the talk to kiss the little girl whom she declared to be
Clementina all over again and then returned to her better behavior with
an effect of shame for her want of selfcontrol as if Clementinas mood
had abashed her Sometimes this was almost severe in its quiet that was
her mother coming to her share in her but again she was like her father
full of the sunny gayety of selfforgetfulness and then Miss Milray
said Now you are the old Clementina

Upon the whole she listened with few interruptions to the story which she
exacted It was mainly what we know After her husbands death Clementina
had gone back to his family for a time and each year since she had spent
part of the winter with them but it was very lonesome for her and she
began to be homesick for Middlemount They saw it and considered it
They ah the best people Miss Milray she said and her voice which
was firm when she spoke of her husband broke in the words of minor
feeling Besides being a little homesick she ended she was not willing
to live on there doing nothing for herself and so she had come back

And you are here doing just what you planned when you talked your life
over with me in Venice

Yes but life isnt eva just what we plan it to be Miss Milray

Ah dont I know it

Clementina surprised Miss Milray by adding In a great many thingsI
dont know but in mostits better I dont complain of mine

You poor child You never complained of anythingnot even of Mrs
Lander

But its different from what I expected and itsstrange

Yes life is very strange

I dont meanlosing him That had to be I can see now that it had to
be almost from the beginning It seems to me that I knew it had to be
from the fust minute I saw him in New Yok but he didnt and I am glad
of that Except when he was getting wohse he always believed he should
get well and he was getting well when he

Miss Milray did not violate the pause she made with any question though
it was apparent that Clementina had something on her mind that she wished
to say and could hardly say of herself

She began again I was glad through everything that I could live with
him so long If there is nothing moa here or anywhea that was
something But it is strange Sometimes it doesnt seem as if it had
happened

I think I can understand Clementina

I feel sometimes as if I hadnt happened myself She stopped with a
patient little sigh and passed her hand across the childs forehead in
a mothers fashion and smoothed her hair from it bending over to look
down into her face We think she has her fathas eyes she said

Yes she has Miss Milray assented noting the upward slant of the
childs eyes which gave his quaintness to her beauty He had
fascinating eyes

After a moment Clementina asked Do you believe that the looks are all
that ah left

Miss Milray reflected I know what you mean I should say character was
left and personalitysomewhere

I used to feel as if it wee left here at fustas if he must come
back But that had to go

Yes

Everything seems to go After a while even the loss of him seemed to
go

Yes losses go with the rest

Thats what I mean by its seeming as if it never any of it happened
Some things before it are a great deal more real

Little things

Not exactly But things when I was very young Miss Milray did not know
quite what she intended but she knew that Clementina was feeling her way
to something she wanted to say and she let her alone When it was all
over and I knew that as long as I lived he would be somewhere else I
tried to be paht of the wold I was left in Do you think that was
right

It was wise and yes it was best said Miss Milray and for relief
from the tension which was beginning to tell upon her own nerves she
asked I suppose you know about my poor brother Id better tell you to
keep you from asking for Mrs Milray though I dont know that its so
very painful with him There isnt any Mrs Milray now she added and
she explained why

Neither of them cared for Mrs Milray and they did not pretend to be
concerned about her but Clementina said vaguely as if in recognition
of Mrs Milrays latest experiment Do you believe in second marriages

Miss Milray laughed Well not that kind exactly

No Clementina assented and she colored a little

Miss Milray was moved to add But if you mean another kind I dont see
why not My own mother was married twice

Was she Clementina looked relieved and encouraged but she did not say
any more at once Then she asked Do you know what ever became of Mr
Belsky

Yes Hes taken his title again and gone back to live in Russia hes
made peace with the Czar I believe

Thats nice said Clementina and Miss Milray made bold to ask

And what has become of Mr Gregory

Clementina answered as Miss Milray thought tentatively and obliquely
You know his wife died

No I never knew that she lived

Yes They went out to China and she died thea

And is he there yet But of course He could never have given up being a
missionary

Well said Clementina he isnt in China His health gave out and he
had to come home Hes in Middlemount Centa

Miss Milray suppressed the Oh that all but broke from her lips
Preaching to the heathen there she temporized

To the summa folks Clementina explained innocent of satire They
have got a Union Chapel thea now and Mr Gregory has been preaching
all summa There seemed nothing more that Miss Milray could prompt her
to say but it was not quite with surprise that she heard Clementina
continue as if it were part of the explanation and followed from the
fact she had stated He wants me to marry him

Miss Milray tried to emulate her calm in asking And shall you

I dont know I told him I would see he only asked me last night It
would be kind of natural He was the fust You may think it is strange

Miss Milray in the superstition of her oldmaidenhood concerning love
really thought it coldblooded and shocking but she said Oh no

Clementina resumed And he says that if it was right for me to stop
caring for him when I did it is right now for me to cae for him again
where thees no one to be hut by it Do you think it is

Yes why not Miss Milray was forced to the admission against what she
believed the finer feelings of her nature

Clementina sighed I suppose hes right I always thought he was good
Women dont seem to belong very much to themselves in this wold do
they

No they seem to belong to the men either because they want the men or
the men want them it comes to the same thing I suppose you dont wish
me to advise you my dear

No I presume its something Ive got to think out for myself

But I think hes good too I ought to say that much for I didnt
always stand his friend with you If Mr Gregory has any fault its being
too scrupulous

You mean about that old troubleour not believing just the same Miss
Milray meant something much more temperamental than that but she allowed
Clementina to limit her meaning and Clementina went on Hes changed
all round now He thinks its all in the life He says that in China they
couldnt understand what he believed but they could what he lived And
he knows I neva could be very religious

It was in Miss Milrays heart to protest Clementina I think you are
one of the most religious persons I ever knew but she forebore because
the praise seemed to her an invasion of Clementinas dignity She merely
said Well I am glad he is one of those who grow more liberal as they
grow older That is a good sign for your happiness But I dare say its
more of his happiness you think

Oh I should like to be happy too There would be no sense in it if I
wasnt

No certainly not

Miss Milray said Clementina with a kind of abruptness do you eva
hear anything from Dr Welwright

No Why Miss Milray fastened her gaze vividly upon her

Oh nothing He wanted me to promise him there in Venice too

I didnt know it

Yes ButI couldnt then And nowhes written to me He wants me to
let him come ova and see me

Andand will you asked Miss Milray rather breathlessly

I dont know I dont know as Id ought I should like to see him so as
to be puffectly sua But if I let him come and then didntIt wouldnt
be right I always felt as if Id ought to have seen then that he caed
for me and stopped him but I didnt No I didnt she repeated
nervously I respected him and I liked him but I nevaShe stopped
and then she asked What do you think Id ought to do Miss Milray

Miss Milray hesitated She was thinking superficially that she had never
heard Clementina say had ought so much if ever before Interiorly she
was recurring to a sense of something like all this before and to the
feeling which she had then that Clementina was really coldblooded and
selfseeking But she remembered that in her former decision Clementina
had finally acted from her heart and her conscience and she rose from
her suspicion with a rebound She dismissed as unworthy of Clementina any
theory which did not account for an ideal of scrupulous and unselfish
justice in her

That is something that nobody can say but yourself Clementina she
answered gravely

Yes sighed Clementina I presume that is so

She rose and took her little girl from Miss Milrays knee Say
goodbye she bade looking tenderly down at her

Miss Milray expected the child to put up her lips to be kissed But she
let go her mothers hand took her tiny skirts between her fingertips
and dropped a curtsey

You little witch cried Miss Milray I want a hug and she crushed
her to her breast while the child twisted her face round and anxiously
questioned her mothers for her approval Tell her its all right
Clementina cried Miss Milray When shes as old as you were in
Florence Im going to make you give her to me

Ah you going back to Florence asked Clementina provisionally

Oh no You cant go back to anything Thats what makes New York so
impossible I think we shall go to Los Angeles




XL

On her way home Clementina met a man walking swiftly forward A sort of
impassioned abstraction expressed itself in his gait and bearing They
had both entered the shadow of the deep pine woods that flanked the way
on either side and the fallen needles helped with the velvety summer
dust of the roadway to hush their steps from each other She saw him far
off but he was not aware of her till she was quite near him

Oh he said with a start You filled my mind so full that I couldnt
have believed you were anywhere outside of it I was coming to get youI
was coming to get my answer

Gregory had grown distinctly older Sickness and hardship had left traces
in his wasted face but the full beard he wore helped to give him an
undue look of age

I dont know said Clementina slowly as Ive got an answa fo you
Mr Gregoryyet

No answer is better that the one I am afraid of

Oh Im not so sure of that she said with gentle perplexity as she
stood holding the hand of her little girl who stared shyly at the
intense face of the man before her

I am he retorted I have been thinking it all over Clementina Ive
tried not to think selfishly about it but I cant pretend that my wish
isnt selfish It is I want you for myself and because Ive always
wanted you and not for any other reason I never cared for any one but
you in the way I cared for you and

Oh she grieved I never caed at all for you after I saw him

I know it must be shocking to you I havent told you with any wretched
hope that it would commend me to you

I dont say it was so very bad said Clementina reflectively if it
was something you couldnt help

It was something I couldnt help Perhaps I didnt try 

Didshe know it

She knew it from the first I told her before we were married

Clementina drew back a little insensibly pulling her child with her I
dont believe I exactly like it

I knew you wouldnt If I could have thought you would I hope I
shouldnt have wishedand fearedso much to tell you

Oh I know you always wanted to do what you believed was right Mr
Gregory she answered But I havent quite thought it out yet You
mustnt hurry me

No no Heaven forbid He stood aside to let her pass

I was just going home she added

May I go with you

Yes if you want to I dont know but you betta we might as well I
want to talk with you Dont you think its something we ought to talk
aboutsensibly

Why of course And I shall try to be guided by you I should always
submit to be ruled by you if

Thats not what I mean exactly I dont want to do the ruling You
dont undastand me

Im afraid I dont he assented humbly

If you did you wouldnt say thatso He did not venture to make any
answer and they walked on without speaking till she asked Did you
know that Miss Milray was at the Middlemount

Miss Milray Of Florence

With her brother I didnt see him Mrs Milray is not hea they ah
divoced Miss Milray used to be very nice to me in Florence She isnt
going back there any moa She says you cant go back to anything Do you
think we can

She had left moments between her incoherent sentences where he might
interrupt her if he would but he waited for her question I hoped we
might but perhaps

No no We couldnt We couldnt go back to that night when you threw
the slippas into the riva no to that time in Florence when we gave up
no to that day in Venice when I had to tell you that I caed moa fo
some one else Dont you see

Yes I see he said in quick revulsion from the hope he had expressed
The past is full of the pain and shame of my errors

I dont want to go back to whats past eitha she reasoned without
gainsaying him

She stopped again as if that were all and he asked Then is that my
answer

I dont believe that even in the otha wold we shall want to go back to
the past much do you she pursued thoughtfully

Once Gregory would have answered confidently he even now checked an
impulse to do so I dont know he owned meekly

I do like you Mr Gregory she relented as if touched by his
meekness to the confession You know I domoa than I ever expected to
like anybody again But its not because I used to like you or because I
think you always acted nicely I think it was cruel of you if you caed
for me to let me believe you didnt afta that fust time I cant eva
think it wasnt no matta why you did it

It was atrocious I can see that now

I say it because I shouldnt eva wish to say it again I know that all
the time you wee betta than what you did and I blame myself a good deal
moa fo not knowing when you came to Florence that I had begun to cae
fo some one else But I did wait till I could see you again so as to be
sua which I caed for the most I tried to be faia before I told you
that I wanted to be free That is all she said gently and Gregory
perceived that the word was left definitely to him

He could not take it till he had disciplined himself to accept
unmurmuringly his sentence as he understood it At any rate he began
I can thank you for rating my motive above my conduct

Oh she said I dont think either of us acted very well I didnt
know till aftawads that I was glad to have you give up the way you did
in Florence I wasbewilded But I ought to have known and I want you
to undastand everything now I dont cae for you because I used to when
I was almost a child and I shouldnt want you to cae for me eitha
because you did then Thats why I wish you had neva felt that you had
always caed fo me

Yes said Gregory He let fall his head in despair

That is what I mean said Clementina If we ah going to begin
togetha now its got to be as if we had neva begun before And you
mustnt think or say or look as if thee had been anything in oua lives
but ouaselves Will you Do you promise She stopped and put her hand
on his breast and pushed against it with a nervous vehemence

No he said I dont promise for I couldnt keep my promise What you
ask is impossible The past is part of us it cant be ignored any more
than it can be destroyed If we take each other it must be for all that
we have been as well as all that we are If we havent the courage for
that we must part

He dropped the little ones hand which he had been holding and moved a
few steps aside Dont she said Theyll think Ive made you and he
took the childs hand again

They had emerged from the shadow of the woods and come in sight of her
fathers house Claxon was standing coatless before the door in full
enjoyment of the late afternoon air his wife beside him at sight of
Gregory quelled a natural impulse to run round the corner of the house
from the presence of strangers

I wonda what theya sayin she fretted

It looks some as if she was sayin yes said Claxon with an impersonal
enjoyment of his conjecture I guess she saw he was bound not to take no
for an answa

I dont know as I should like it very much his wife relucted Clems
doin very well as it is She no need to marry again

Oh I guess it ant that altogetha Hes a good man Claxon mused a
moment upon the figures which had begun to advance again with the little
one between them and then gave way in a burst of paternal pride And I
dont know as I should blame him so very much for wantin Clem She
always did want to be of moa useBut I guess she likes him too

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
