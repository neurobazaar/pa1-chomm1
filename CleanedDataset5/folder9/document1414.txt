SOMEBODYS LUGGAGE


CHAPTER IHIS LEAVING IT TILL CALLED FOR


The writer of these humble lines being a Waiter and having come of a
family of Waiters and owning at the present time five brothers who are
all Waiters and likewise an only sister who is a Waitress would wish to
offer a few words respecting his calling first having the pleasure of
hereby in a friendly manner offering the Dedication of the same unto
_Joseph_ much respected Head Waiter at the Slamjam Coffeehouse London
EC than which a individual more eminently deserving of the name of
man or a more amenable honour to his own head and heart whether
considered in the light of a Waiter or regarded as a human being do not
exist

In case confusion should arise in the public mind which it is open to
confusion on many subjects respecting what is meant or implied by the
term Waiter the present humble lines would wish to offer an explanation
It may not be generally known that the person as goes out to wait is
_not_ a Waiter It may not be generally known that the hand as is called
in extra at the Freemasons Tavern or the London or the Albion or
otherwise is _not_ a Waiter Such hands may be took on for Public
Dinners by the bushel and you may know them by their breathing with
difficulty when in attendance and taking away the bottle ere yet it is
half out but such are _not_ Waiters For you cannot lay down the
tailoring or the shoemaking or the brokering or the greengrocering
or the pictorialperiodicalling or the secondhand wardrobe or the
small fancy businessesyou cannot lay down those lines of life at your
will and pleasure by the halfday or evening and take up Waitering You
may suppose you can but you cannot or you may go so far as to say you
do but you do not Nor yet can you lay down the gentlemansservice
when stimulated by prolonged incompatibility on the part of Cooks and
here it may be remarked that Cooking and Incompatibility will be mostly
found united and take up Waitering It has been ascertained that what
a gentleman will sit meek under at home he will not bear out of doors
at the Slamjam or any similar establishment Then what is the inference
to be drawn respecting true Waitering You must be bred to it You must
be born to it

Would you know how born to it Fair Readerif of the adorable female
sex Then learn from the biographical experience of one that is a Waiter
in the sixtyfirst year of his age

You were conveyedere yet your dawning powers were otherwise developed
than to harbour vacancy in your insideyou were conveyed by
surreptitious means into a pantry adjoining the Admiral Nelson Civic
and General DiningRooms there to receive by stealth that healthful
sustenance which is the pride and boast of the British female
constitution Your mother was married to your father himself a distant
Waiter in the profoundest secrecy for a Waitress known to be married
would ruin the best of businessesit is the same as on the stage Hence
your being smuggled into the pantry and thatto add to the
inflictionby an unwilling grandmother Under the combined influence of
the smells of roast and boiled and soup and gas and malt liquors you
partook of your earliest nourishment your unwilling grandmother sitting
prepared to catch you when your mother was called and dropped you your
grandmothers shawl ever ready to stifle your natural complainings your
innocent mind surrounded by uncongenial cruets dirty plates
dishcovers and cold gravy your mother calling down the pipe for veals
and porks instead of soothing you with nursery rhymes Under these
untoward circumstances you were early weaned Your unwilling
grandmother ever growing more unwilling as your food assimilated less
then contracted habits of shaking you till your system curdled and your
food would not assimilate at all At length she was no longer spared
and could have been thankfully spared much sooner When your brothers
began to appear in succession your mother retired left off her smart
dressing she had previously been a smart dresser and her dark ringlets
which had previously been flowing and haunted your father late of
nights lying in wait for him through all weathers up the shabby court
which led to the back door of the Royal Old DustBin said to have been
so named by George the Fourth where your father was Head But the Dust
Bin was going down then and your father took but littleexcepting from
a liquid point of view Your mothers object in those visits was of a
housekeeping character and you was set on to whistle your father out
Sometimes he came out but generally not Come or not come however all
that part of his existence which was unconnected with open Waitering was
kept a close secret and was acknowledged by your mother to be a close
secret and you and your mother flitted about the court close secrets
both of you and would scarcely have confessed under torture that you
know your father or that your father had any name than Dick which
wasnt his name though he was never known by any other or that he had
kith or kin or chick or child Perhaps the attraction of this mystery
combined with your fathers having a damp compartment to himself behind
a leaky cistern at the DustBina sort of a cellar compartment with a
sink in it and a smell and a platerack and a bottlerack and three
windows that didnt match each other or anything else and no
daylightcaused your young mind to feel convinced that you must grow up
to be a Waiter too but you did feel convinced of it and so did all your
brothers down to your sister Every one of you felt convinced that you
was born to the Waitering At this stage of your career what was your
feelings one day when your father came home to your mother in open broad
daylightof itself an act of Madness on the part of a Waiterand took
to his bed leastwise your mother and familys bed with the statement
that his eyes were devilled kidneys Physicians being in vain your
father expired after repeating at intervals for a day and a night when
gleams of reason and old business fitfully illuminated his being Two
and two is five And three is sixpence Interred in the parochial
department of the neighbouring churchyard and accompanied to the grave
by as many Waiters of long standing as could spare the morning time from
their soiled glasses namely one your bereaved form was attired in a
white neckankecher and you was took on from motives of benevolence at
The George and Gridiron theatrical and supper Here supporting nature
on what you found in the plates which was as it happened and but too
often thoughtlessly immersed in mustard and on what you found in the
glasses which rarely went beyond driblets and lemon by night you
dropped asleep standing till you was cuffed awake and by day was set to
polishing every individual article in the coffeeroom Your couch being
sawdust your counterpane being ashes of cigars Here frequently hiding
a heavy heart under the smart tie of your white neckankecher or
correctly speaking lower down and more to the left you picked up the
rudiments of knowledge from an extra by the name of Bishops and by
calling platewasher and gradually elevating your mind with chalk on the
back of the cornerbox partition until such time as you used the
inkstand when it was out of hand attained to manhood and to be the
Waiter that you find yourself

I could wish here to offer a few respectful words on behalf of the
calling so long the calling of myself and family and the public interest
in which is but too often very limited We are not generally understood
No we are not Allowance enough is not made for us For say that we
ever show a little drooping listlessness of spirits or what might be
termed indifference or apathy Put it to yourself what would your own
state of mind be if you was one of an enormous family every member of
which except you was always greedy and in a hurry Put it to yourself
that you was regularly replete with animal food at the slack hours of one
in the day and again at nine pm and that the repleter you was the
more voracious all your fellowcreatures came in Put it to yourself
that it was your business when your digestion was well on to take a
personal interest and sympathy in a hundred gentlemen fresh and fresh
say for the sake of argument only a hundred whose imaginations was
given up to grease and fat and gravy and melted butter and abandoned to
questioning you about cuts of this and dishes of thateach of em
going on as if him and you and the bill of fare was alone in the world
Then look what you are expected to know You are never out but they
seem to think you regularly attend everywhere Whats this
Christopher that I hear about the smashed Excursion Train How are they
doing at the Italian Opera Christopher Christopher what are the
real particulars of this business at the Yorkshire Bank Similarly a
ministry gives me more trouble than it gives the Queen As to Lord
Palmerston the constant and wearing connection into which I have been
brought with his lordship during the last few years is deserving of a
pension Then look at the Hypocrites we are made and the lies white I
hope that are forced upon us Why must a sedentarypursuited Waiter be
considered to be a judge of horseflesh and to have a most tremendous
interest in horsetraining and racing Yet it would be half our little
incomes out of our pockets if we didnt take on to have those sporting
tastes It is the same inconceivable why with Farming Shooting
equally so I am sure that so regular as the months of August
September and October come round I am ashamed of myself in my own
private bosom for the way in which I make believe to care whether or not
the grouse is strong on the wing much their wings or drumsticks either
signifies to me uncooked and whether the partridges is plentiful
among the turnips and whether the pheasants is shy or bold or anything
else you please to mention Yet you may see me or any other Waiter of
my standing holding on by the back of the box and leaning over a
gentleman with his purse out and his bill before him discussing these
points in a confidential tone of voice as if my happiness in life
entirely depended on em

I have mentioned our little incomes Look at the most unreasonable point
of all and the point on which the greatest injustice is done us Whether
it is owing to our always carrying so much change in our righthand
trouserspocket and so many halfpence in our coattails or whether it
is human nature which I were loth to believe what is meant by the
everlasting fable that Head Waiters is rich How did that fable get into
circulation Who first put it about and what are the facts to establish
the unblushing statement Come forth thou slanderer and refer the
public to the Waiters will in Doctors Commons supporting thy malignant
hiss Yet this is so commonly dwelt uponespecially by the screws who
give Waiters the leastthat denial is vain and we are obliged for our
credits sake to carry our heads as if we were going into a business
when of the two we are much more likely to go into a union There was
formerly a screw as frequented the Slamjam ere yet the present writer had
quitted that establishment on a question of teaing his assistant staff
out of his own pocket which screw carried the taunt to its bitterest
height Never soaring above threepence and as often as not grovelling
on the earth a penny lower he yet represented the present writer as a
large holder of Consols a lender of money on mortgage a Capitalist He
has been overheard to dilate to other customers on the allegation that
the present writer put out thousands of pounds at interest in
Distilleries and Breweries Well Christopher he would say having
grovelled his lowest on the earth half a moment before looking out
for a House to open eh Cant find a business to be disposed of on a
scale as is up to your resources humph To such a dizzy precipice of
falsehood has this misrepresentation taken wing that the wellknown and
highlyrespected OLD CHARLES long eminent at the West Country Hotel and
by some considered the Father of the Waitering found himself under the
obligation to fall into it through so many years that his own wife for
he had an unbeknown old lady in that capacity towards himself believed
it And what was the consequence When he was borne to his grave on the
shoulders of six picked Waiters with six more for change six more
acting as pallbearers all keeping step in a pouring shower without a
dry eye visible and a concourse only inferior to Royalty his pantry and
lodgings was equally ransacked high and low for property and none was
found How could it be found when beyond his last monthly collection
of walkingsticks umbrellas and pockethandkerchiefs which happened to
have been not yet disposed of though he had ever been through life
punctual in clearing off his collections by the month there was no
property existing Such however is the force of this universal libel
that the widow of Old Charles at the present hour an inmate of the
Almshouses of the CorkCutters Company in Blue Anchor Road identified
sitting at the door of one of em in a clean cap and a Windsor
armchair only last Monday expects Johns hoarded wealth to be found
hourly Nay ere yet he had succumbed to the grisly dart and when his
portrait was painted in oils lifesize by subscription of the
frequenters of the West Country to hang over the coffeeroom chimney
piece there were not wanting those who contended that what is termed the
accessories of such a portrait ought to be the Bank of England out of
window and a strongbox on the table And but for betterregulated
minds contending for a bottle and screw and the attitude of drawingand
carrying their pointit would have been so handed down to posterity

I am now brought to the title of the present remarks Having I hope
without offence to any quarter offered such observations as I felt it my
duty to offer in a free country which has ever dominated the seas on
the general subject I will now proceed to wait on the particular
question

At a momentous period of my life when I was off so far as concerned
notice given with a House that shall be namelessfor the question on
which I took my departing stand was a fixed charge for waiters and no
House as commits itself to that eminently UnEnglish act of more than
foolishness and baseness shall be advertised by meI repeat at a
momentous crisis when I was off with a House too mean for mention and
not yet on with that to which I have ever since had the honour of being
attached in the capacity of Head 1 I was casting about what to do
next Then it were that proposals were made to me on behalf of my
present establishment Stipulations were necessary on my part
emendations were necessary on my part in the end ratifications ensued
on both sides and I entered on a new career

We are a bed business and a coffeeroom business We are not a general
dining business nor do we wish it In consequence when diners drop in
we know what to give em as will keep em away another time We are a
Private Room or Family business also but Coffeeroom principal Me and
the Directory and the Writing Materials and cetrer occupy a place to
ourselvesa place fended of up a step or two at the end of the Coffee
room in what I call the good oldfashioned style The good
oldfashioned style is that whatever you want down to a wafer you must
be olely and solely dependent on the Head Waiter for You must put
yourself a newborn Child into his hands There is no other way in which
a business untinged with Continental Vice can be conducted It were
bootless to add that if languages is required to be jabbered and English
is not good enough both families and gentlemen had better go somewhere
else

When I began to settle down in this rightprincipled and wellconducted
House I noticed under the bed in No 24 B which it is up a angle off
the staircase and usually put off upon the lowlyminded a heap of
things in a corner I asked our Head Chambermaid in the course of the
day

What are them things in 24 B

To which she answered with a careless air Somebodys Luggage

Regarding her with a eye not free from severity I says Whose Luggage

Evading my eye she replied

Lor How should _I_ know

Being it may be right to mention a female of some pertness though
acquainted with her business

A Head Waiter must be either Head or Tail He must be at one extremity
or the other of the social scale He cannot be at the waist of it or
anywhere else but the extremities It is for him to decide which of the
extremities

On the eventful occasion under consideration I give Mrs Pratchett so
distinctly to understand my decision that I broke her spirit as towards
myself then and there and for good Let not inconsistency be suspected
on account of my mentioning Mrs Pratchett as Mrs and having formerly
remarked that a waitress must not be married Readers are respectfully
requested to notice that Mrs Pratchett was not a waitress but a
chambermaid Now a chambermaid _may_ be married if Head generally is
marriedor says so It comes to the same thing as expressing what is
customary NB Mr Pratchett is in Australia and his address there is
the Bush

Having took Mrs Pratchett down as many pegs as was essential to the
future happiness of all parties I requested her to explain herself

For instance I says to give her a little encouragement who is
Somebody

I give you my sacred honour Mr Christopher answers Pratchett that
I havent the faintest notion

But for the manner in which she settled her capstrings I should have
doubted this but in respect of positiveness it was hardly to be
discriminated from an affidavit

Then you never saw him I followed her up with

Nor yet said Mrs Pratchett shutting her eyes and making as if she
had just took a pill of unusual circumferencewhich gave a remarkable
force to her denialnor yet any servant in this house All have been
changed Mr Christopher within five year and Somebody left his Luggage
here before then

Inquiry of Miss Martin yielded in the language of the Bard of A1
confirmation strong So it had really and truly happened Miss Martin
is the young lady at the bar as makes out our bills and though higher
than I could wish considering her station is perfectly wellbehaved

Farther investigations led to the disclosure that there was a bill
against this Luggage to the amount of two sixteen six The Luggage had
been lying under the bedstead of 24 B over six year The bedstead is a
fourposter with a deal of old hanging and valance and is as I once
said probably connected with more than 24 Bswhich I remember my
hearers was pleased to laugh at at the time

I dont know whywhen DO we know whybut this Luggage laid heavy on
my mind I fell a wondering about Somebody and what he had got and been
up to I couldnt satisfy my thoughts why he should leave so much
Luggage against so small a bill For I had the Luggage out within a day
or two and turned it over and the following were the itemsA black
portmanteau a black bag a desk a dressingcase a brownpaper parcel
a hatbox and an umbrella strapped to a walkingstick It was all very
dusty and fluey I had our porter up to get under the bed and fetch it
out and though he habitually wallows in dustswims in it from morning
to night and wears a closefitting waistcoat with black calimanco
sleeves for the purposeit made him sneeze again and his throat was
that hot with it that it was obliged to be cooled with a drink of
Allsopps draft

The Luggage so got the better of me that instead of having it put back
when it was well dusted and washed with a wet clothprevious to which
it was so covered with feathers that you might have thought it was
turning into poultry and would byandby begin to LayI say instead
of having it put back I had it carried into one of my places
downstairs There from time to time I stared at it and stared at it
till it seemed to grow big and grow little and come forward at me and
retreat again and go through all manner of performances resembling
intoxication When this had lasted weeksI may say months and not be
far outI one day thought of asking Miss Martin for the particulars of
the Two sixteen six total She was so obliging as to extract it from the
booksit dating before her timeand here follows a true copy

Mem January 1st 1857 He went out after dinner directing luggage to
be ready when he called for it Never called

    

So far from throwing a light upon the subject this bill appeared to me
if I may so express my doubts to involve it in a yet more lurid halo
Speculating it over with the Mistress she informed me that the luggage
had been advertised in the Masters time as being to be sold after such
and such a day to pay expenses but no farther steps had been taken I
may here remark that the Mistress is a widow in her fourth year The
Master was possessed of one of those unfortunate constitutions in which
Spirits turns to Water and rises in the illstarred Victim

My speculating it over not then only but repeatedly sometimes with the
Mistress sometimes with one sometimes with another led up to the
Mistresss saying to mewhether at first in joke or in earnest or half
joke and half earnest it matters not

Christopher I am going to make you a handsome offer

If this should meet her eyea lovely bluemay she not take it ill my
mentioning that if I had been eight or ten year younger I would have
done as much by her That is I would have made her a offer It is for
others than me to denominate it a handsome one

Christopher I am going to make you a handsome offer

Put a name to it maam

Look here Christopher Run over the articles of Somebodys Luggage
Youve got it all by heart I know

A black portmanteau maam a black bag a desk a dressingcase a
brownpaper parcel a hatbox and an umbrella strapped to a
walkingstick

All just as they were left Nothing opened nothing tampered with

You are right maam All locked but the brownpaper parcel and that
sealed

The Mistress was leaning on Miss Martins desk at the barwindow and she
taps the open book that lays upon the deskshe has a prettymade hand
to be sureand bobs her head over it and laughs

Come says she Christopher Pay me Somebodys bill and you shall
have Somebodys Luggage

I rather took to the idea from the first moment but

It maynt be worth the money I objected seeming to hold back

Thats a Lottery says the Mistress folding her arms upon the bookit
aint her hands alone thats pretty made the observation extends right
up her arms Wont you venture two pound sixteen shillings and sixpence
in the Lottery Why theres no blanks says the Mistress laughing and
bobbing her head again you _must_ win If you lose you must win All
prizes in this Lottery Draw a blank and remember GentlemenSportsmen
youll still be entitled to a black portmanteau a black bag a desk a
dressingcase a sheet of brown paper a hatbox and an umbrella
strapped to a walkingstick

To make short of it Miss Martin come round me and Mrs Pratchett come
round me and the Mistress she was completely round me already and all
the women in the house come round me and if it had been Sixteen two
instead of Two sixteen I should have thought myself well out of it For
what can you do when they do come round you

So I paid the moneydownand such a laughing as there was among em
But I turned the tables on em regularly when I said

My familyname is BlueBeard Im going to open Somebodys Luggage all
alone in the Secret Chamber and not a female eye catches sight of the
contents

Whether I thought proper to have the firmness to keep to this dont
signify or whether any female eye and if any how many was really
present when the opening of the Luggage came off Somebodys Luggage is
the question at present Nobodys eyes nor yet noses

What I still look at most in connection with that Luggage is the
extraordinary quantity of writingpaper and all written on And not our
paper neithernot the paper charged in the bill for we know our
paperso he must have been always at it And he had crumpled up this
writing of his everywhere in every part and parcel of his luggage
There was writing in his dressingcase writing in his boots writing
among his shavingtackle writing in his hatbox writing folded away
down among the very whalebones of his umbrella

His clothes wasnt bad what there was of em His dressingcase was
poornot a particle of silver stopperbottle apertures with nothing
in em like empty little dogkennelsand a most searching description
of toothpowder diffusing itself around as under a deluded mistake that
all the chinks in the fittings was divisions in teeth His clothes I
parted with well enough to a secondhand dealer not far from St
Clements Danes in the Strandhim as the officers in the Army mostly
dispose of their uniforms to when hard pressed with debts of honour if
I may judge from their coats and epaulets diversifying the window with
their backs towards the public The same party bought in one lot the
portmanteau the bag the desk the dressingcase the hatbox the
umbrella strap and walkingstick On my remarking that I should have
thought those articles not quite in his line he said No more ith a
manth grandmother Mithter Chrithtopher but if any man will bring hith
grandmother here and offer her at a fair trifle below what thell feth
with good luck when theth thcoured and turnedIll buy her

These transactions brought me home and indeed more than home for they
left a goodish profit on the original investment And now there remained
the writings and the writings I particular wish to bring under the
candid attention of the reader

I wish to do so without postponement for this reason That is to say
namely viz ie as follows thusBefore I proceed to recount the
mental sufferings of which I became the prey in consequence of the
writings and before following up that harrowing tale with a statement of
the wonderful and impressive catastrophe as thrilling in its nature as
unlooked for in any other capacity which crowned the ole and filled the
cup of unexpectedness to overflowing the writings themselves ought to
stand forth to view Therefore it is that they now come next One word
to introduce them and I lay down my pen I hope my unassuming pen
until I take it up to trace the gloomy sequel of a mind with something on
it

He was a smeary writer and wrote a dreadful bad hand Utterly
regardless of ink he lavished it on every undeserving objecton his
clothes his desk his hat the handle of his toothbrush his umbrella
Ink was found freely on the coffeeroom carpet by No 4 table and two
blots was on his restless couch A reference to the document I have
given entire will show that on the morning of the third of February
eighteen fiftysix he procured his no less than fifth pen and paper To
whatever deplorable act of ungovernable composition he immolated those
materials obtained from the bar there is no doubt that the fatal deed
was committed in bed and that it left its evidences but too plainly
long afterwards upon the pillowcase

He had put no Heading to any of his writings Alas Was he likely to
have a Heading without a Head and where was _his_ Head when he took such
things into it In some cases such as his Boots he would appear to
have hid the writings thereby involving his style in greater obscurity
But his Boots was at least pairsand no two of his writings can put in
any claim to be so regarded Here follows not to give more specimens
what was found in




CHAPTER IIHIS BOOTS


Eh well then Monsieur Mutuel What do I know what can I say I
assure you that he calls himself Monsieur The Englishman

Pardon But I think it is impossible said Monsieur Mutuela
spectacled snuffy stooping old gentleman in carpet shoes and a cloth
cap with a peaked shade a loose blue frockcoat reaching to his heels a
large limp white shirtfrill and cravat to correspondthat is to say
white was the natural colour of his linen on Sundays but it toned down
with the week

It is repeated Monsieur Mutuel his amiable old walnutshell
countenance very walnutshelly indeed as he smiled and blinked in the
bright morning sunlightit is my cherished Madame Bouclet I think
impossible

Hey with a little vexed cry and a great many tosses of her head
But it is not impossible that you are a Pig retorted Madame Bouclet a
compact little woman of thirtyfive or so See thenlook thereread
On the second floor Monsieur LAnglais Is it not so

It is so said Monsieur Mutuel

Good Continue your morning walk Get out Madame Bouclet dismissed
him with a lively snap of her fingers

The morning walk of Monsieur Mutuel was in the brightest patch that the
sun made in the Grande Place of a dull old fortified French town The
manner of his morning walk was with his hands crossed behind him an
umbrella in figure the express image of himself always in one hand a
snuffbox in the other Thus with the shuffling gait of the Elephant
who really does deal with the very worst trousersmaker employed by the
Zoological world and who appeared to have recommended him to Monsieur
Mutuel the old gentleman sunned himself daily when sun was to be hadof
course at the same time sunning a red ribbon at his buttonhole for was
he not an ancient Frenchman

Being told by one of the angelic sex to continue his morning walk and get
out Monsieur Mutuel laughed a walnutshell laugh pulled off his cap at
arms length with the hand that contained his snuffbox kept it off for a
considerable period after he had parted from Madame Bouclet and
continued his morning walk and got out like a man of gallantry as he
was

The documentary evidence to which Madame Bouclet had referred Monsieur
Mutuel was the list of her lodgers sweetly written forth by her own
Nephew and Bookkeeper who held the pen of an Angel and posted up at the
side of her gateway for the information of the Police Au second M
LAnglais Proprietaire On the second floor Mr The Englishman man
of property So it stood nothing could be plainer

Madame Bouclet now traced the line with her forefinger as it were to
confirm and settle herself in her parting snap at Monsieur Mutuel and so
placing her right hand on her hip with a defiant air as if nothing
should ever tempt her to unsnap that snap strolled out into the Place to
glance up at the windows of Mr The Englishman That worthy happening to
be looking out of window at the moment Madame Bouclet gave him a
graceful salutation with her head looked to the right and looked to the
left to account to him for her being there considered for a moment like
one who accounted to herself for somebody she had expected not being
there and reentered her own gateway Madame Bouclet let all her house
giving on the Place in furnished flats or floors and lived up the yard
behind in company with Monsieur Bouclet her husband great at billiards
an inherited brewing business several fowls two carts a nephew a
little dog in a big kennel a grapevine a countinghouse four horses
a married sister with a share in the brewing business the husband and
two children of the married sister a parrot a drum performed on by the
little boy of the married sister two billeted soldiers a quantity of
pigeons a fife played by the nephew in a ravishing manner several
domestics and supernumeraries a perpetual flavour of coffee and soup a
terrific range of artificial rocks and wooden precipices at least four
feet high a small fountain and halfadozen large sunflowers

Now the Englishman in taking his Appartementor as one might say on
our side of the Channel his set of chambershad given his name
correct to the letter LANGLEY But as he had a British way of not
opening his mouth very wide on foreign soil except at meals the Brewery
had been able to make nothing of it but LAnglais So Mr The Englishman
he had become and he remained

Never saw such a people muttered Mr The Englishman as he now looked
out of window Never did in my life

This was true enough for he had never before been out of his own
countrya right little island a tight little island a bright little
island a showfight little island and full of merit of all sorts but
not the whole round world

These chaps said Mr The Englishman to himself as his eye rolled over
the Place sprinkled with military here and there are no more like
soldiers Nothing being sufficiently strong for the end of his
sentence he left it unended

This again from the point of view of his experience was strictly
correct for though there was a great agglomeration of soldiers in the
town and neighbouring country you might have held a grand Review and
Fieldday of them every one and looked in vain among them all for a
soldier choking behind his foolish stock or a soldier lamed by his ill
fitting shoes or a soldier deprived of the use of his limbs by straps
and buttons or a soldier elaborately forced to be selfhelpless in all
the small affairs of life A swarm of brisk bright active bustling
handy odd skirmishing fellows able to turn cleverly at anything from
a siege to soup from great guns to needles and thread from the
broadsword exercise to slicing an onion from making war to making
omelets was all you would have found

What a swarm From the Great Place under the eye of Mr The Englishman
where a few awkward squads from the last conscription were doing the
goosestepsome members of those squads still as to their bodies in the
chrysalis peasantstate of Blouse and only military butterflies as to
their regimentallyclothed legsfrom the Great Place away outside the
fortifications and away for miles along the dusty roads soldiers
swarmed All day long upon the grassgrown ramparts of the town
practising soldiers trumpeted and bugled all day long down in angles of
dry trenches practising soldiers drummed and drummed Every forenoon
soldiers burst out of the great barracks into the sandy gymnasiumground
hard by and flew over the wooden horse and hung on to flying ropes and
dangled upsidedown between parallel bars and shot themselves off wooden
platformssplashes sparks coruscations showers of soldiers At
every corner of the townwall every guardhouse every gateway every
sentrybox every drawbridge every reedy ditch and rushy dike
soldiers soldiers soldiers And the town being pretty well all wall
guardhouse gateway sentrybox drawbridge reedy ditch and rushy
dike the town was pretty well all soldiers

What would the sleepy old town have been without the soldiers seeing
that even with them it had so overslept itself as to have slept its
echoes hoarse its defensive bars and locks and bolts and chains all
rusty and its ditches stagnant From the days when VAUBAN engineered it
to that perplexing extent that to look at it was like being knocked on
the head with it the stranger becoming stunned and stertorous under the
shock of its incomprehensibilityfrom the days when VAUBAN made it the
express incorporation of every substantive and adjective in the art of
military engineering and not only twisted you into it and twisted you
out of it to the right to the left opposite under here over there
in the dark in the dirt by the gateway archway covered way dry way
wet way fosse portcullis drawbridge sluice squat tower pierced
wall and heavy battery but likewise took a fortifying dive under the
neighbouring country and came to the surface three or four miles off
blowing out incomprehensible mounds and batteries among the quiet crops
of chicory and beetrootfrom those days to these the town had been
asleep and dust and rust and must had settled on its drowsy Arsenals and
Magazines and grass had grown up in its silent streets

On marketdays alone its Great Place suddenly leaped out of bed On
marketdays some friendly enchanter struck his staff upon the stones of
the Great Place and instantly arose the liveliest booths and stalls and
sittings and standings and a pleasant hum of chaffering and huckstering
from many hundreds of tongues and a pleasant though peculiar blending
of colourswhite caps blue blouses and green vegetablesand at last
the Knight destined for the adventure seemed to have come in earnest and
all the Vaubanois sprang up awake And now by long lowlying avenues
of trees jolting in whitehooded donkeycart and on donkeyback and in
tumbril and wagon and cart and cabriolet and afoot with barrow and
burdenand along the dikes and ditches and canals in little
peakprowed country boatscame peasantmen and women in flocks and
crowds bringing articles for sale And here you had boots and shoes
and sweetmeats and stuffs to wear and here in the cool shade of the
Townhall you had milk and cream and butter and cheese and here you had
fruits and onions and carrots and all things needful for your soup and
here you had poultry and flowers and protesting pigs and here new
shovels axes spades and billhooks for your farming work and here
huge mounds of bread and here your unground grain in sacks and here
your childrens dolls and here the cakeseller announcing his wares by
beat and roll of drum And hark fanfaronade of trumpets and here into
the Great Place resplendent in an open carriage with four gorgeously
attired servitors up behind playing horns drums and cymbals rolled
the Daughter of a Physician in massive golden chains and earrings and
bluefeathered hat shaded from the admiring sun by two immense umbrellas
of artificial roses to dispense from motives of philanthropy that
small and pleasant dose which had cured so many thousands Toothache
earache headache heartache stomachache debility nervousness fits
fainting fever ague all equally cured by the small and pleasant dose
of the great Physicians great daughter The process was thisshe the
Daughter of a Physician proprietress of the superb equipage you now
admired with its confirmatory blasts of trumpet drum and cymbal told
you so On the first day after taking the small and pleasant dose you
would feel no particular influence beyond a most harmonious sensation of
indescribable and irresistible joy on the second day you would be so
astonishingly better that you would think yourself changed into somebody
else on the third day you would be entirely free from disorder whatever
its nature and however long you had had it and would seek out the
Physicians Daughter to throw yourself at her feet kiss the hem of her
garment and buy as many more of the small and pleasant doses as by the
sale of all your few effects you could obtain but she would be
inaccessiblegone for herbs to the Pyramids of Egyptand you would be
though cured reduced to despair Thus would the Physicians Daughter
drive her trade and briskly too and thus would the buying and selling
and mingling of tongues and colours continue until the changing
sunlight leaving the Physicians Daughter in the shadow of high roofs
admonished her to jolt out westward with a departing effect of gleam and
glitter on the splendid equipage and brazen blast And now the enchanter
struck his staff upon the stones of the Great Place once more and down
went the booths the sittings and standings and vanished the
merchandise and with it the barrows donkeys donkeycarts and
tumbrils and all other things on wheels and feet except the slow
scavengers with unwieldy carts and meagre horses clearing up the rubbish
assisted by the sleek town pigeons better plumped out than on nonmarket
days While there was yet an hour or two to wane before the autumn
sunset the loiterer outside towngate and drawbridge and postern and
doubleditch would see the last whitehooded cart lessening in the
avenue of lengthening shadows of trees or the last country boat paddled
by the last marketwoman on her way home showing black upon the
reddening long low narrow dike between him and the mill and as the
paddleparted scum and weed closed over the boats track he might be
comfortably sure that its sluggish rest would be troubled no more until
next marketday

As it was not one of the Great Places days for getting out of bed when
Mr The Englishman looked down at the young soldiers practising the goose
step there his mind was left at liberty to take a military turn

These fellows are billeted everywhere about said he and to see them
lighting the peoples fires boiling the peoples pots minding the
peoples babies rocking the peoples cradles washing the peoples
greens and making themselves generally useful in every sort of
unmilitary way is most ridiculous Never saw such a set of
fellowsnever did in my life

All perfectly true again Was there not Private Valentine in that very
house acting as sole housemaid valet cook steward and nurse in the
family of his captain Monsieur le Capitaine de la Courcleaning the
floors making the beds doing the marketing dressing the captain
dressing the dinners dressing the salads and dressing the baby all
with equal readiness Or to put him aside he being in loyal attendance
on his Chief was there not Private Hyppolite billeted at the Perfumers
two hundred yards off who when not on duty volunteered to keep shop
while the fair Perfumeress stepped out to speak to a neighbour or so and
laughingly sold soap with his warsword girded on him Was there not
Emile billeted at the Clockmakers perpetually turning to of an
evening with his coat off winding up the stock Was there not Eugene
billeted at the Tinmans cultivating pipe in mouth a garden four feet
square for the Tinman in the little court behind the shop and
extorting the fruits of the earth from the same on his knees with the
sweat of his brow Not to multiply examples was there not Baptiste
billeted on the poor Watercarrier at that very instant sitting on the
pavement in the sunlight with his martial legs asunder and one of the
Watercarriers spare pails between them which to the delight and glory
of the heart of the Watercarrier coming across the Place from the
fountain yoked and burdened he was painting brightgreen outside and
brightred within Or to go no farther than the Barbers at the very
next door was there not Corporal Theophile

No said Mr The Englishman glancing down at the Barbers he is not
there at present Theres the child though

A mere mite of a girl stood on the steps of the Barbers shop looking
across the Place A mere baby one might call her dressed in the close
white linen cap which small French country children wear like the
children in Dutch pictures and in a frock of homespun blue that had no
shape except where it was tied round her little fat throat So that
being naturally short and round all over she looked behind as if she
had been cut off at her natural waist and had had her head neatly fitted
on it

Theres the child though

To judge from the way in which the dimpled hand was rubbing the eyes the
eyes had been closed in a nap and were newly opened But they seemed to
be looking so intently across the Place that the Englishman looked in
the same direction

O said he presently I thought as much The Corporals there

The Corporal a smart figure of a man of thirty perhaps a thought under
the middle size but very neatly madea sunburnt Corporal with a brown
peaked beardfaced about at the moment addressing voluble words of
instruction to the squad in hand Nothing was amiss or awry about the
Corporal A lithe and nimble Corporal quite complete from the
sparkling dark eyes under his knowing uniform cap to his sparkling white
gaiters The very image and presentment of a Corporal of his countrys
army in the line of his shoulders the line of his waist the broadest
line of his Bloomer trousers and their narrowest line at the calf of his
leg

Mr The Englishman looked on and the child looked on and the Corporal
looked on but the lastnamed at his men until the drill ended a few
minutes afterwards and the military sprinkling dried up directly and
was gone Then said Mr The Englishman to himself Look here By
George And the Corporal dancing towards the Barbers with his arms
wide open caught up the child held her over his head in a flying
attitude caught her down again kissed her and made off with her into
the Barbers house

Now Mr The Englishman had had a quarrel with his erring and disobedient
and disowned daughter and there was a child in that case too Had not
his daughter been a child and had she not taken angelflights above his
head as this child had flown above the Corporals

Hes a National Participledfool said the Englishman and shut
his window

But the windows of the house of Memory and the windows of the house of
Mercy are not so easily closed as windows of glass and wood They fly
open unexpectedly they rattle in the night they must be nailed up Mr
The Englishman had tried nailing them but had not driven the nails quite
home So he passed but a disturbed evening and a worse night

By nature a goodtempered man No very little gentleness confounding
the quality with weakness Fierce and wrathful when crossed Very and
stupendously unreasonable Moody Exceedingly so Vindictive Well
he had had scowling thoughts that he would formally curse his daughter
as he had seen it done on the stage But remembering that the real
Heaven is some paces removed from the mock one in the great chandelier of
the Theatre he had given that up

And he had come abroad to be rid of his repudiated daughter for the rest
of his life And here he was

At bottom it was for this reason more than for any other that Mr The
Englishman took it extremely ill that Corporal Theophile should be so
devoted to little Bebelle the child at the Barbers shop In an unlucky
moment he had chanced to say to himself Why confound the fellow he is
not her father There was a sharp sting in the speech which ran into
him suddenly and put him in a worse mood So he had National
Participled the unconscious Corporal with most hearty emphasis and had
made up his mind to think no more about such a mountebank

But it came to pass that the Corporal was not to be dismissed If he had
known the most delicate fibres of the Englishmans mind instead of
knowing nothing on earth about him and if he had been the most obstinate
Corporal in the Grand Army of France instead of being the most obliging
he could not have planted himself with more determined immovability plump
in the midst of all the Englishmans thoughts Not only so but he
seemed to be always in his view Mr The Englishman had but to look out
of window to look upon the Corporal with little Bebelle He had but to
go for a walk and there was the Corporal walking with Bebelle He had
but to come home again disgusted and the Corporal and Bebelle were at
home before him If he looked out at his back windows early in the
morning the Corporal was in the Barbers back yard washing and dressing
and brushing Bebelle If he took refuge at his front windows the
Corporal brought his breakfast out into the Place and shared it there
with Bebelle Always Corporal and always Bebelle Never Corporal
without Bebelle Never Bebelle without Corporal

Mr The Englishman was not particularly strong in the French language as
a means of oral communication though he read it very well It is with
languages as with peoplewhen you only know them by sight you are apt
to mistake them you must be on speaking terms before you can be said to
have established an acquaintance

For this reason Mr The Englishman had to gird up his loins considerably
before he could bring himself to the point of exchanging ideas with
Madame Bouclet on the subject of this Corporal and this Bebelle But
Madame Bouclet looking in apologetically one morning to remark that O
Heaven she was in a state of desolation because the lampmaker had not
sent home that lamp confided to him to repair but that truly he was a
lampmaker against whom the whole world shrieked out Mr The Englishman
seized the occasion

Madame that baby

Pardon monsieur That lamp

No no that little girl

But pardon said Madame Bonclet angling for a clew one cannot light
a little girl or send her to be repaired

The little girlat the house of the barber

Ahhh cried Madame Bouclet suddenly catching the idea with her
delicate little line and rod Little Bebelle Yes yes yes And her
friend the Corporal Yes yes yes yes So genteel of himis it
not

He is not

Not at all not at all He is not one of her relations Not at all

Why then he

Perfectly cried Madame Bouclet you are right monsieur It is so
genteel of him The less relation the more genteel As you say

Is she

The child of the barber Madame Bouclet whisked up her skilful little
line and rod again Not at all not at all She is the child ofin a
word of no one

The wife of the barber then

Indubitably As you say The wife of the barber receives a small
stipend to take care of her So much by the month Eh then It is
without doubt very little for we are all poor here

You are not poor madame

As to my lodgers replied Madame Bouclet with a smiling and a gracious
bend of her head no As to all things else soso

You flatter me madame

Monsieur it is you who flatter me in living here

Certain fishy gasps on Mr The Englishmans part denoting that he was
about to resume his subject under difficulties Madame Bouclet observed
him closely and whisked up her delicate line and rod again with
triumphant success

O no monsieur certainly not The wife of the barber is not cruel to
the poor child but she is careless Her health is delicate and she
sits all day looking out at window Consequently when the Corporal
first came the poor little Bebelle was much neglected

It is a curious began Mr The Englishman

Name That Bebelle Again you are right monsieur But it is a
playful name for Gabrielle

And so the child is a mere fancy of the Corporals said Mr The
Englishman in a gruffly disparaging tone of voice

Eh well returned Madame Bouclet with a pleading shrug one must
love something Human nature is weak

Devilish weak muttered the Englishman in his own language

And the Corporal pursued Madame Bouclet being billeted at the
barberswhere he will probably remain a long time for he is attached
to the Generaland finding the poor unowned child in need of being
loved and finding himself in need of lovingwhy there you have it
all you see

Mr The Englishman accepted this interpretation of the matter with an
indifferent grace and observed to himself in an injured manner when he
was again alone I shouldnt mind it so much if these people were not
such aNational Participledsentimental people

There was a Cemetery outside the town and it happened ill for the
reputation of the Vaubanois in this sentimental connection that he took
a walk there that same afternoon To be sure there were some wonderful
things in it from the Englishmans point of view and of a certainty in
all Britain you would have found nothing like it Not to mention the
fanciful flourishes of hearts and crosses in wood and iron that were
planted all over the place making it look very like a Fireworkground
where a most splendid pyrotechnic display might be expected after dark
there were so many wreaths upon the graves embroidered as it might be
To my mother To my daughter To my father To my brother To my
sister To my friend and those many wreaths were in so many stages of
elaboration and decay from the wreath of yesterday all fresh colour and
bright beads to the wreath of last year a poor mouldering wisp of
straw There were so many little gardens and grottos made upon graves
in so many tastes with plants and shells and plaster figures and
porcelain pitchers and so many odds and ends There were so many
tributes of remembrance hanging up not to be discriminated by the
closest inspection from little round waiters whereon were depicted in
glowing lines either a lady or a gentleman with a white
pockethandkerchief out of all proportion leaning in a state of the
most faultless mourning and most profound affliction on the most
architectural and gorgeous urn There were so many surviving wives who
had put their names on the tombs of their deceased husbands with a blank
for the date of their own departure from this weary world and there were
so many surviving husbands who had rendered the same homage to their
deceased wives and out of the number there must have been so many who
had long ago married again In fine there was so much in the place that
would have seemed more frippery to a stranger save for the consideration
that the lightest paper flower that lay upon the poorest heap of earth
was never touched by a rude hand but perished there a sacred thing

Nothing of the solemnity of Death here Mr The Englishman had been
going to say when this last consideration touched him with a mild
appeal and on the whole he walked out without saying it But these
people are he insisted by way of compensation when he was well
outside the gate they are soParticipledsentimental

His way back lay by the military gymnasiumground And there he passed
the Corporal glibly instructing young soldiers how to swing themselves
over rapid and deep watercourses on their way to Glory by means of a
rope and himself deftly plunging off a platform and flying a hundred
feet or two as an encouragement to them to begin And there he also
passed perched on a crowning eminence probably the Corporals careful
hands the small Bebelle with her round eyes wide open surveying the
proceeding like a wondering sort of blue and white bird

If that child was to die this was his reflection as he turned his back
and went his wayand it would almost serve the fellow right for making
such a fool of himselfI suppose we should have him sticking up a
wreath and a waiter in that fantastic buryingground

Nevertheless after another early morning or two of looking out of
window he strolled down into the Place when the Corporal and Bebelle
were walking there and touching his hat to the Corporal an immense
achievement wished him Goodday

Goodday monsieur

This is a rather pretty child you have here said Mr The Englishman
taking her chin in his hand and looking down into her astonished blue
eyes

Monsieur she is a very pretty child returned the Corporal with a
stress on his polite correction of the phrase

And good said the Englishman

And very good Poor little thing

Hah The Englishman stooped down and patted her cheek not without
awkwardness as if he were going too far in his conciliation And what
is this medal round your neck my little one

Bebelle having no other reply on her lips than her chubby right fist the
Corporal offered his services as interpreter

Monsieur demands what is this Bebelle

It is the Holy Virgin said Bebelle

And who gave it you asked the Englishman

Theophile

And who is Theophile

Bebelle broke into a laugh laughed merrily and heartily clapped her
chubby hands and beat her little feet on the stone pavement of the
Place

He doesnt know Theophile Why he doesnt know any one He doesnt
know anything Then sensible of a small solecism in her manners
Bebelle twisted her right hand in a leg of the Corporals Bloomer
trousers and laying her cheek against the place kissed it

Monsieur Theophile I believe said the Englishman to the Corporal

It is I monsieur

Permit me Mr The Englishman shook him heartily by the hand and
turned away But he took it mighty ill that old Monsieur Mutuel in his
patch of sunlight upon whom he came as he turned should pull off his
cap to him with a look of pleased approval And he muttered in his own
tongue as he returned the salutation Well walnutshell And what
business is it of _yours_

Mr The Englishman went on for many weeks passing but disturbed evenings
and worse nights and constantly experiencing that those aforesaid
windows in the houses of Memory and Mercy rattled after dark and that he
had very imperfectly nailed them up Likewise he went on for many weeks
daily improving the acquaintance of the Corporal and Bebelle That is to
say he took Bebelle by the chin and the Corporal by the hand and
offered Bebelle sous and the Corporal cigars and even got the length of
changing pipes with the Corporal and kissing Bebelle But he did it all
in a shamefaced way and always took it extremely ill that Monsieur
Mutuel in his patch of sunlight should note what he did Whenever that
seemed to be the case he always growled in his own tongue There you
are again walnutshell What business is it of yours

In a word it had become the occupation of Mr The Englishmans life to
look after the Corporal and little Bebelle and to resent old Monsieur
Mutuels looking after _him_ An occupation only varied by a fire in the
town one windy night and much passing of waterbuckets from hand to hand
in which the Englishman rendered good service and much beating of
drumswhen all of a sudden the Corporal disappeared

Next all of a sudden Bebelle disappeared

She had been visible a few days later than the Corporalsadly
deteriorated as to washing and brushingbut she had not spoken when
addressed by Mr The Englishman and had looked scared and had run away
And now it would seem that she had run away for good And there lay the
Great Place under the windows bare and barren

In his shamefaced and constrained way Mr The Englishman asked no
question of any one but watched from his front windows and watched from
his back windows and lingered about the Place and peeped in at the
Barbers shop and did all this and much more with a whistling and tune
humming pretence of not missing anything until one afternoon when
Monsieur Mutuels patch of sunlight was in shadow and when according to
all rule and precedent he had no right whatever to bring his red ribbon
out of doors behold here he was advancing with his cap already in his
hand twelve paces off

Mr The Englishman had got as far into his usual objurgation as What bu
si when he checked himself

Ah it is sad it is sad Helas it is unhappy it is sad Thus old
Monsieur Mutuel shaking his gray head

What businat least I would say what do you mean Monsieur Mutuel

Our Corporal Helas our dear Corporal

What has happened to him

You have not heard

No

At the fire But he was so brave so ready Ah too brave too ready

May the Devil carry you away the Englishman broke in impatiently I
beg your pardonI mean meI am not accustomed to speak Frenchgo
on will you

And a falling beam

Good God exclaimed the Englishman It was a private soldier who was
killed

No A Corporal the same Corporal our dear Corporal Beloved by all
his comrades The funeral ceremony was touchingpenetrating Monsieur
The Englishman your eyes fill with tears

What busi

Monsieur The Englishman I honour those emotions I salute you with
profound respect I will not obtrude myself upon your noble heart

Monsieur Mutuela gentleman in every thread of his cloudy linen under
whose wrinkled hand every grain in the quarter of an ounce of poor snuff
in his poor little tin box became a gentlemans propertyMonsieur
Mutuel passed on with his cap in his hand

I little thought said the Englishman after walking for several
minutes and more than once blowing his nose when I was looking round
that cemeteryIll go there

Straight he went there and when he came within the gate he paused
considering whether he should ask at the lodge for some direction to the
grave But he was less than ever in a mood for asking questions and he
thought I shall see something on it to know it by

In search of the Corporals grave he went softly on up this walk and
down that peering in among the crosses and hearts and columns and
obelisks and tombstones for a recently disturbed spot It troubled him
now to think how many dead there were in the cemeteryhe had not
thought them a tenth part so numerous beforeand after he had walked
and sought for some time he said to himself as he struck down a new
vista of tombs I might suppose that every one was dead but I

Not every one A live child was lying on the ground asleep Truly he
had found something on the Corporals grave to know it by and the
something was Bebelle

With such a loving will had the dead soldiers comrades worked at his
restingplace that it was already a neat garden On the green turf of
the garden Bebelle lay sleeping with her cheek touching it A plain
unpainted little wooden Cross was planted in the turf and her short arm
embraced this little Cross as it had many a time embraced the Corporals
neck They had put a tiny flag the flag of France at his head and a
laurel garland

Mr The Englishman took off his hat and stood for a while silent Then
covering his head again he bent down on one knee and softly roused the
child

Bebelle My little one

Opening her eyes on which the tears were still wet Bebelle was at first
frightened but seeing who it was she suffered him to take her in his
arms looking steadfastly at him

You must not lie here my little one You must come with me

No no I cant leave Theophile I want the good dear Theophile

We will go and seek him Bebelle We will go and look for him in
England We will go and look for him at my daughters Bebelle

Shall we find him there

We shall find the best part of him there Come with me poor forlorn
little one Heaven is my witness said the Englishman in a low voice
as before he rose he touched the turf above the gentle Corporals
breast that I thankfully accept this trust

It was a long way for the child to have come unaided She was soon
asleep again with her embrace transferred to the Englishmans neck He
looked at her worn shoes and her galled feet and her tired face and
believed that she had come there every day

He was leaving the grave with the slumbering Bebelle in his arms when he
stopped looked wistfully down at it and looked wistfully at the other
graves around It is the innocent custom of the people said Mr The
Englishman with hesitation I think I should like to do it No one
sees

Careful not to wake Bebelle as he went he repaired to the lodge where
such little tokens of remembrance were sold and bought two wreaths One
blue and white and glistening silver To my friend one of a soberer
red and black and yellow To my friend With these he went back to the
grave and so down on one knee again Touching the childs lips with the
brighter wreath he guided her hand to hang it on the Cross then hung
his own wreath there After all the wreaths were not far out of keeping
with the little garden To my friend To my friend

Mr The Englishman took it very ill when he looked round a street corner
into the Great Place carrying Bebelle in his arms that old Mutuel
should be there airing his red ribbon He took a world of pains to dodge
the worthy Mutuel and devoted a surprising amount of time and trouble to
skulking into his own lodging like a man pursued by Justice Safely
arrived there at last he made Bebelles toilet with as accurate a
remembrance as he could bring to bear upon that work of the way in which
he had often seen the poor Corporal make it and having given her to eat
and drink laid her down on his own bed Then he slipped out into the
barbers shop and after a brief interview with the barbers wife and a
brief recourse to his purse and cardcase came back again with the whole
of Bebelles personal property in such a very little bundle that it was
quite lost under his arm

As it was irreconcilable with his whole course and character that he
should carry Bebelle off in state or receive any compliments or
congratulations on that feat he devoted the next day to getting his two
portmanteaus out of the house by artfulness and stealth and to
comporting himself in every particular as if he were going to run
awayexcept indeed that he paid his few debts in the town and
prepared a letter to leave for Madame Bouclet enclosing a sufficient sum
of money in lieu of notice A railway train would come through at
midnight and by that train he would take away Bebelle to look for
Theophile in England and at his forgiven daughters

At midnight on a moonlight night Mr The Englishman came creeping forth
like a harmless assassin with Bebelle on his breast instead of a dagger
Quiet the Great Place and quiet the neverstirring streets closed the
cafes huddled together motionless their billiardballs drowsy the guard
or sentinel on duty here and there lulled for the time by sleep even
the insatiate appetite of the Office of Towndues

Mr The Englishman left the Place behind and left the streets behind
and left the civilianinhabited town behind and descended down among the
military works of Vauban hemming all in As the shadow of the first
heavy arch and postern fell upon him and was left behind as the shadow
of the second heavy arch and postern fell upon him and was left behind
as his hollow tramp over the first drawbridge was succeeded by a gentler
sound as his hollow tramp over the second drawbridge was succeeded by a
gentler sound as he overcame the stagnant ditches one by one and passed
out where the flowing waters were and where the moonlight so the dark
shades and the hollow sounds and the unwholesomely locked currents of his
soul were vanquished and set free See to it Vaubans of your own
hearts who gird them in with triple walls and ditches and with bolt and
chain and bar and lifted bridgeraze those fortifications and lay them
level with the allabsorbing dust before the night cometh when no hand
can work

All went prosperously and he got into an empty carriage in the train
where he could lay Bebelle on the seat over against him as on a couch
and cover her from head to foot with his mantle He had just drawn
himself up from perfecting this arrangement and had just leaned back in
his own seat contemplating it with great satisfaction when he became
aware of a curious appearance at the open carriage windowa ghostly
little tin box floating up in the moonlight and hovering there

He leaned forward and put out his head Down among the rails and wheels
and ashes Monsieur Mutuel red ribbon and all

Excuse me Monsieur The Englishman said Monsieur Mutuel holding up
his box at arms length the carriage being so high and he so low but I
shall reverence the little box for ever if your so generous hand will
take a pinch from it at parting

Mr The Englishman reached out of the window before complying
andwithout asking the old fellow what business it was of hisshook
hands and said Adieu God bless you

And Mr The Englishman God bless _you_ cried Madame Bouclet who was
also there among the rails and wheels and ashes And God will bless you
in the happiness of the protected child now with you And God will bless
you in your own child at home And God will bless you in your own
remembrances And this from me

He had barely time to catch a bouquet from her hand when the train was
flying through the night Round the paper that enfolded it was bravely
written doubtless by the nephew who held the pen of an Angel Homage
to the friend of the friendless

Not bad people Bebelle said Mr The Englishman softly drawing the
mantle a little from her sleeping face that he might kiss it though
they are so

Too sentimental himself at the moment to be able to get out that word
he added nothing but a sob and travelled for some miles through the
moonlight with his hand before his eyes




CHAPTER IIIHIS BROWNPAPER PARCEL


My works are well known I am a young man in the Art line You have
seen my works many a time though its fifty thousand to one if you have
seen me You say you dont want to see me You say your interest is in
my works and not in me Dont be too sure about that Stop a bit

Let us have it down in black and white at the first go off so that there
may be no unpleasantness or wrangling afterwards And this is looked
over by a friend of mine a ticket writer that is up to literature I
am a young man in the Art linein the FineArt line You have seen my
works over and over again and you have been curious about me and you
think you have seen me Now as a safe rule you never have seen me and
you never do see me and you never will see me I think thats plainly
putand its what knocks me over

If theres a blighted public character going I am the party

It has been remarked by a certain or an uncertain philosopher that
the world knows nothing of its greatest men He might have put it
plainer if he had thrown his eye in my direction He might have put it
that while the world knows something of them that apparently go in and
win it knows nothing of them that really go in and dont win There it
is again in another formand thats what knocks me over

Not that its only myself that suffers from injustice but that I am more
alive to my own injuries than to any other mans Being as I have
mentioned in the FineArt line and not the Philanthropic line I openly
admit it As to company in injury I have company enough Who are you
passing every day at your Competitive Excruciations The fortunate
candidates whose heads and livers you have turned upside down for life
Not you You are really passing the Crammers and Coaches If your
principle is right why dont you turn out tomorrow morning with the
keys of your cities on velvet cushions your musicians playing and your
flags flying and read addresses to the Crammers and Coaches on your
bended knees beseeching them to come out and govern you Then again
as to your public business of all sorts your Financial statements and
your Budgets the Public knows much truly about the real doers of all
that Your Nobles and Right Honourables are firstrate men Yes and so
is a goose a firstrate bird But Ill tell you this about the
gooseyoull find his natural flavour disappointing without stuffing

Perhaps I am soured by not being popular But suppose I AM popular
Suppose my works never fail to attract Suppose that whether they are
exhibited by natural light or by artificial they invariably draw the
public Then no doubt they are preserved in some Collection No they
are not they are not preserved in any Collection Copyright No nor
yet copyright Anyhow they must be somewhere Wrong again for they are
often nowhere

Says you At all events you are in a moody state of mind my friend
My answer is I have described myself as a public character with a blight
upon himwhich fully accounts for the curdling of the milk in _that_
cocoanut

Those that are acquainted with London are aware of a locality on the
Surrey side of the river Thames called the Obelisk or more generally
the Obstacle Those that are not acquainted with London will also be
aware of it now that I have named it My lodging is not far from that
locality I am a young man of that easy disposition that I lie abed
till its absolutely necessary to get up and earn something and then I
lie abed again till I have spent it

It was on an occasion when I had had to turn to with a view to victuals
that I found myself walking along the Waterloo Road one evening after
dark accompanied by an acquaintance and fellowlodger in the gasfitting
way of life He is very good company having worked at the theatres
and indeed he has a theatrical turn himself and wishes to be brought
out in the character of Othello but whether on account of his regular
work always blacking his face and hands more or less I cannot say

Tom he says what a mystery hangs over you

Yes Mr Clickthe rest of the house generally give him his name as
being first front carpeted all over his own furniture and if not
mahogany an outandout imitationyes Mr Click a mystery does hang
over me

Makes you low you see dont it says he eyeing me sideways

Why yes Mr Click there are circumstances connected with it that
have I yielded to a sigh a lowering effect

Gives you a touch of the misanthrope too dont it says he Well
Ill tell you what If I was you Id shake it of

If I was you I would Mr Click but if you was me you wouldnt

Ah says he theres something in that

When we had walked a little further he took it up again by touching me
on the chest

You see Tom it seems to me as if in the words of the poet who wrote
the domestic drama of The Stranger you had a silent sorrow there

I have Mr Click

I hope Tom lowering his voice in a friendly way it isnt coining
or smashing

No Mr Click Dont be uneasy

Nor yet forg Mr Click checked himself and added counterfeiting
anything for instance

No Mr Click I am lawfully in the Art lineFineArt linebut I can
say no more

Ah Under a species of star A kind of malignant spell A sort of a
gloomy destiny A cankerworm pegging away at your vitals in secret as
well as I make it out said Mr Click eyeing me with some admiration

I told Mr Click that was about it if we came to particulars and I
thought he appeared rather proud of me

Our conversation had brought us to a crowd of people the greater part
struggling for a front place from which to see something on the pavement
which proved to be various designs executed in coloured chalks on the
pavement stones lighted by two candles stuck in mud sconces The
subjects consisted of a fine fresh salmons head and shoulders supposed
to have been recently sent home from the fishmongers a moonlight night
at sea in a circle dead game scrollwork the head of a hoary hermit
engaged in devout contemplation the head of a pointer smoking a pipe
and a cherubim his flesh creased as in infancy going on a horizontal
errand against the wind All these subjects appeared to me to be
exquisitely done

On his knees on one side of this gallery a shabby person of modest
appearance who shivered dreadfully though it wasnt at all cold was
engaged in blowing the chalkdust off the moon toning the outline of the
back of the hermits head with a bit of leather and fattening the down
stroke of a letter or two in the writing I have forgotten to mention
that writing formed a part of the composition and that it alsoas it
appeared to mewas exquisitely done It ran as follows in fine round
characters An honest man is the noblest work of God 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 Pounds s d Employment in an office is humbly requested Honour
the Queen Hunger is a 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 sharp thorn Chip chop
cherry chop fol de rol de ri do Astronomy and mathematics I do this
to support my family

Murmurs of admiration at the exceeding beauty of this performance went
about among the crowd The artist having finished his touching and
having spoilt those places took his seat on the pavement with his
knees crouched up very nigh his chin and halfpence began to rattle in

A pity to see a man of that talent brought so low aint it said one
of the crowd to me

What he might have done in the coachpainting or housedecorating
said another man who took up the first speaker because I did not

Why he writesalonelike the Lord Chancellor said another man

Better said another I know his writing He couldnt support his
family this way

Then a woman noticed the natural fluffiness of the hermits hair and
another woman her friend mentioned of the salmons gills that you could
almost see him gasp Then an elderly country gentleman stepped forward
and asked the modest man how he executed his work And the modest man
took some scraps of brown paper with colours in em out of his pockets
and showed them Then a faircomplexioned donkey with sandy hair and
spectacles asked if the hermit was a portrait To which the modest man
casting a sorrowful glance upon it replied that it was to a certain
extent a recollection of his father This caused a boy to yelp out Is
the Pinter a smoking the pipe your mother who was immediately shoved
out of view by a sympathetic carpenter with his basket of tools at his
back

At every fresh question or remark the crowd leaned forward more eagerly
and dropped the halfpence more freely and the modest man gathered them
up more meekly At last another elderly gentleman came to the front
and gave the artist his card to come to his office tomorrow and get
some copying to do The card was accompanied by sixpence and the artist
was profoundly grateful and before he put the card in his hat read it
several times by the light of his candles to fix the address well in his
mind in case he should lose it The crowd was deeply interested by this
last incident and a man in the second row with a gruff voice growled to
the artist Youve got a chance in life now aint you The artist
answered sniffing in a very lowspirited way however Im thankful to
hope so Upon which there was a general chorus of You are all right
and the halfpence slackened very decidedly

I felt myself pulled away by the arm and Mr Click and I stood alone at
the corner of the next crossing

Why Tom said Mr Click what a horrid expression of face youve
got

Have I says I

Have you says Mr Click Why you looked as if you would have his
blood

Whose blood

The artists

The artists I repeated And I laughed frantically wildly
gloomily incoherently disagreeably I am sensible that I did I know
I did

Mr Click stared at me in a scared sort of a way but said nothing until
we had walked a streets length He then stopped short and said with
excitement on the part of his forefinger

Thomas I find it necessary to be plain with you I dont like the
envious man I have identified the cankerworm thats pegging away at
_your_ vitals and its envy Thomas

Is it says I

Yes it is says be Thomas beware of envy It is the greeneyed
monster which never did and never will improve each shining hour but
quite the reverse I dread the envious man Thomas I confess that I am
afraid of the envious man when he is so envious as you are Whilst you
contemplated the works of a gifted rival and whilst you heard that
rivals praises and especially whilst you met his humble glance as he
put that card away your countenance was so malevolent as to be terrific
Thomas I have heard of the envy of them that follows the FineArt line
but I never believed it could be what yours is I wish you well but I
take my leave of you And if you should ever got into trouble through
knifeingor say garottinga brother artist as I believe you will
dont call me to character Thomas or I shall be forced to injure your
case

Mr Click parted from me with those words and we broke off our
acquaintance

I became enamoured Her name was Henrietta Contending with my easy
disposition I frequently got up to go after her She also dwelt in the
neighbourhood of the Obstacle and I did fondly hope that no other would
interpose in the way of our union

To say that Henrietta was volatile is but to say that she was woman To
say that she was in the bonnettrimming is feebly to express the taste
which reigned predominant in her own

She consented to walk with me Let me do her the justice to say that she
did so upon trial I am not said Henrietta as yet prepared to
regard you Thomas in any other light than as a friend but as a friend
I am willing to walk with you on the understanding that softer
sentiments may flow

We walked

Under the influence of Henriettas beguilements I now got out of bed
daily I pursued my calling with an industry before unknown and it
cannot fail to have been observed at that period by those most familiar
with the streets of London that there was a larger supply But hold
The time is not yet come

One evening in October I was walking with Henrietta enjoying the cool
breezes wafted over Vauxhall Bridge After several slow turns Henrietta
gaped frequently so inseparable from woman is the love of excitement
and said Lets go home by Grosvenor Place Piccadilly and
Waterloolocalities I may state for the information of the stranger
and the foreigner well known in London and the last a Bridge

No Not by Piccadilly Henrietta said I

And why not Piccadilly for goodness sake said Henrietta

Could I tell her Could I confess to the gloomy presentiment that
overshadowed me Could I make myself intelligible to her No

I dont like Piccadilly Henrietta

But I do said she Its dark now and the long rows of lamps in
Piccadilly after dark are beautiful I _will_ go to Piccadilly

Of course we went It was a pleasant night and there were numbers of
people in the streets It was a brisk night but not too cold and not
damp Let me darkly observe it was the best of all nightsFOR THE
PURPOSE

As we passed the garden wall of the Royal Palace going up Grosvenor
Place Henrietta murmured

I wish I was a Queen

Why so Henrietta

I would make _you_ Something said she and crossed her two hands on my
arm and turned away her head

Judging from this that the softer sentiments alluded to above had begun
to flow I adapted my conduct to that belief Thus happily we passed on
into the detested thoroughfare of Piccadilly On the right of that
thoroughfare is a row of trees the railing of the Green Park and a fine
broad eligible piece of pavement

Oh my cried Henrietta presently Theres been an accident

I looked to the left and said Where Henrietta

Not there stupid said she Over by the Park railings Where the
crowd is Oh no its not an accident its something else to look at
Whats them lights

She referred to two lights twinkling low amongst the legs of the
assemblage two candles on the pavement

Oh do come along cried Henrietta skipping across the road with me I
hung back but in vain Do lets look

Again designs upon the pavement Centre compartment Mount Vesuvius
going it in a circle supported by four oval compartments severally
representing a ship in heavy weather a shoulder of mutton attended by
two cucumbers a golden harvest with distant cottage of proprietor and a
knife and fork after nature above the centre compartment a bunch of
grapes and over the whole a rainbow The whole as it appeared to me
exquisitely done

The person in attendance on these works of art was in all respects
shabbiness excepted unlike the former personage His whole appearance
and manner denoted briskness Though threadbare he expressed to the
crowd that poverty had not subdued his spirit or tinged with any sense
of shame this honest effort to turn his talents to some account The
writing which formed a part of his composition was conceived in a
similarly cheerful tone It breathed the following sentiments The
writer is poor but not despondent To a British 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
Public he Pounds s d appeals Honour to our brave Army And also 0 9
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 to our gallant Navy BRITONS STRIKE the A B C D E F G
writer in common chalks would be grateful for any suitable employment
HOME HURRAH The whole of this writing appeared to me to be
exquisitely done

But this man in one respect like the last though seemingly hard at it
with a great show of brown paper and rubbers was only really fattening
the downstroke of a letter here and there or blowing the loose chalk
off the rainbow or toning the outside edge of the shoulder of mutton
Though he did this with the greatest confidence he did it as it struck
me in so ignorant a manner and so spoilt everything he touched that
when he began upon the purple smoke from the chimney of the distant
cottage of the proprietor of the golden harvest which smoke was
beautifully soft I found myself saying aloud without considering of
it

Let that alone will you

Halloa said the man next me in the crowd jerking me roughly from him
with his elbow why didnt you send a telegram If we had known you was
coming wed have provided something better for you You understand the
mans work better than he does himself dont you Have you made your
will Youre too clever to live long

Dont be hard upon the gentleman sir said the person in attendance on
the works of art with a twinkle in his eye as he looked at me he may
chance to be an artist himself If so sir he will have a
fellowfeeling with me sir when Ihe adapted his action to his words
as he went on and gave a smart slap of his hands between each touch
working himself all the time about and about the compositionwhen I
lighten the bloom of my grapesshade off the orange in my rainbowdot
the i of my Britonsthrow a yellow light into my cowcum_ber_insinuate
another morsel of fat into my shoulder of muttondart another zigzag
flash of lightning at my ship in distress

He seemed to do this so neatly and was so nimble about it that the
halfpence came flying in

Thanks generous public thanks said the professor You will
stimulate me to further exertions My name will be found in the list of
British Painters yet I shall do better than this with encouragement I
shall indeed

You never can do better than that bunch of grapes said Henrietta Oh
Thomas them grapes

Not better than _that_ lady I hope for the time when I shall paint
anything but your own bright eyes and lips equal to life

Thomas did you ever But it must take a long time sir said
Henrietta blushing to paint equal to that

I was prenticed to it miss said the young man smartly touching up
the compositionprenticed to it in the caves of Spain and Portingale
ever so long and two year over

There was a laugh from the crowd and a new man who had worked himself in
next me said Hes a smart chap too aint he

And what a eye exclaimed Henrietta softly

Ah He need have a eye said the man

Ah He just need was murmured among the crowd

He couldnt come that ere burning mountain without a eye said the
man He had got himself accepted as an authority somehow and everybody
looked at his finger as it pointed out Vesuvius To come that effect in
a general illumination would require a eye but to come it with two
dipswhy its enough to blind him

That impostor pretending not to have heard what was said now winked to
any extent with both eyes at once as if the strain upon his sight was
too much and threw back his long hairit was very longas if to cool
his fevered brow I was watching him doing it when Henrietta suddenly
whispered Oh Thomas how horrid you look and pulled me out by the
arm

Remembering Mr Clicks words I was confused when I retorted What do
you mean by horrid

Oh gracious Why you looked said Henrietta as if you would have
his blood

I was going to answer So I would for twopencefrom his nose when I
checked myself and remained silent

We returned home in silence Every step of the way the softer
sentiments that had flowed ebbed twenty mile an hour Adapting my
conduct to the ebbing as I had done to the flowing I let my arm drop
limp so as she could scarcely keep hold of it and I wished her such a
cold goodnight at parting that I keep within the bounds of truth when I
characterise it as a Rasper

In the course of the next day I received the following document

 Henrietta informs Thomas that my eyes are open to you I must ever
 wish you well but walking and us is separated by an unfarmable abyss
 One so malignant to superiorityOh that look at himcan never never
 conduct

 HENRIETTA

 PSTo the altar

Yielding to the easiness of my disposition I went to bed for a week
after receiving this letter During the whole of such time London was
bereft of the usual fruits of my labour When I resumed it I found that
Henrietta was married to the artist of Piccadilly

Did I say to the artist What fell words were those expressive of what
a galling hollowness of what a bitter mockery IIIam the artist
I was the real artist of Piccadilly I was the real artist of the
Waterloo Road I am the only artist of all those pavementsubjects which
daily and nightly arouse your admiration I do em and I let em out
The man you behold with the papers of chalks and the rubbers touching up
the downstrokes of the writing and shading off the salmon the man you
give the credit to the man you give the money to hiresyes and I live
to tell ithires those works of art of me and brings nothing to em
but the candles

Such is genius in a commercial country I am not up to the shivering I
am not up to the liveliness I am not up to the wantingemploymentinan
office move I am only up to originating and executing the work In
consequence of which you never see me you think you see me when you see
somebody else and that somebody else is a mere Commercial character The
one seen by self and Mr Click in the Waterloo Road can only write a
single word and that I taught him and its MULTIPLICATIONwhich you
may see him execute upside down because he cant do it the natural way
The one seen by self and Henrietta by the Green Park railings can just
smear into existence the two ends of a rainbow with his cuff and a
rubberif very hard put upon making a showbut he could no more come
the arch of the rainbow to save his life than he could come the
moonlight fish volcano shipwreck mutton hermit or any of my most
celebrated effects

To conclude as I began if theres a blighted public character going I
am the party And often as you have seen do see and will see my
Works its fifty thousand to one if youll ever see me unless when the
candles are burnt down and the Commercial character is gone you should
happen to notice a neglected young man perseveringly rubbing out the last
traces of the pictures so that nobody can renew the same Thats me




CHAPTER IVHIS WONDERFUL END


It will have been ere now perceived that I sold the foregoing writings
From the fact of their being printed in these pages the inference will
ere now have been drawn by the reader may I add the gentle reader
that I sold them to One who never yet2

Having parted with the writings on most satisfactory termsfor in
opening negotiations with the present Journal was I not placing myself
in the hands of One of whom it may be said in the words of Another
2resumed my usual functions But I too soon discovered that peace
of mind had fled from a brow which up to that time Time had merely took
the hair off leaving an unruffled expanse within

It were superfluous to veil itthe brow to which I allude is my own

Yes over that brow uneasiness gathered like the sable wing of the fabled
bird asas no doubt will be easily identified by all rightminded
individuals If not I am unable on the spur of the moment to enter
into particulars of him The reflection that the writings must now
inevitably get into print and that He might yet live and meet with them
sat like the Hag of Night upon my jaded form The elasticity of my
spirits departed Fruitless was the Bottle whether Wine or Medicine I
had recourse to both and the effect of both upon my system was
witheringly lowering

In this state of depression into which I subsided when I first began to
revolve what could I ever say if Hethe unknownwas to appear in the
Coffeeroom and demand reparation I one forenoon in this last November
received a turn that appeared to be given me by the finger of Fate and
Conscience hand in hand I was alone in the Coffeeroom and had just
poked the fire into a blaze and was standing with my back to it trying
whether heat would penetrate with soothing influence to the Voice within
when a young man in a cap of an intelligent countenance though
requiring his hair cut stood before me

Mr Christopher the Head Waiter

The same

The young man shook his hair out of his visionwhich it impededto a
packet from his breast and handing it over to me said with his eye or
did I dream fixed with a lambent meaning on me THE PROOFS

Although I smelt my coattails singeing at the fire I had not the power
to withdraw them The young man put the packet in my faltering grasp
and repeatedlet me do him the justice to add with civility

THE PROOFS A Y R

With those words he departed

A Y R And You Remember Was that his meaning At Your Risk Were
the letters short for _that_ reminder Anticipate Your Retribution Did
they stand for _that_ warning Outdacious Youth Repent But no for
that a O was happily wanting and the vowel here was a A

I opened the packet and found that its contents were the foregoing
writings printed just as the reader may I add the discerning reader
peruses them In vain was the reassuring whisperAYR All the Year
Roundit could not cancel the Proofs Too appropriate name The
Proofs of my having sold the Writings

My wretchedness daily increased I had not thought of the risk I ran
and the defying publicity I put my head into until all was done and all
was in print Give up the money to be off the bargain and prevent the
publication I could not My family was down in the world Christmas was
coming on a brother in the hospital and a sister in the rheumatics could
not be entirely neglected And it was not only ins in the family that
had told on the resources of one unaided Waitering outs were not
wanting A brother out of a situation and another brother out of money
to meet an acceptance and another brother out of his mind and another
brother out at New York not the same though it might appear so had
really and truly brought me to a stand till I could turn myself round I
got worse and worse in my meditations constantly reflecting The
Proofs and reflecting that when Christmas drew nearer and the Proofs
were published there could be no safety from hour to hour but that He
might confront me in the Coffeeroom and in the face of day and his
country demand his rights

The impressive and unlookedfor catastrophe towards which I dimly pointed
the reader shall I add the highly intellectual reader in my first
remarks now rapidly approaches

It was November still but the last echoes of the Guy Foxes had long
ceased to reverberate We was slackseveral joints under our average
mark and wine of course proportionate So slack had we become at
last that Beds Nos 26 27 28 and 31 having took their six oclock
dinners and dozed over their respective pints had drove away in their
respective Hansoms for their respective Night Mailtrains and left us
empty

I had took the evening paper to No 6 tablewhich is warm and most to
be preferredand lost in the allabsorbing topics of the day had
dropped into a slumber I was recalled to consciousness by the
wellknown intimation Waiter and replying Sir found a gentleman
standing at No 4 table The reader shall I add the observant reader
will please to notice the locality of the gentleman_at No 4 table_

He had one of the newfangled uncollapsable bags in his hand which I am
against for I dont see why you shouldnt collapse while you are about
it as your fathers collapsed before you and he said

I want to dine waiter I shall sleep here tonight

Very good sir What will you take for dinner sir

Soup bit of codfish oyster sauce and the joint

Thank you sir

I rang the chambermaids bell and Mrs Pratchett marched in according
to custom demurely carrying a lighted flat candle before her as if she
was one of a long public procession all the other members of which was
invisible

In the meanwhile the gentleman had gone up to the mantelpiece right in
front of the fire and had laid his forehead against the mantelpiece
which it is a low one and brought him into the attitude of leapfrog
and had heaved a tremenjous sigh His hair was long and lightish and
when he laid his forehead against the mantelpiece his hair all fell in a
dusty fluff together over his eyes and when he now turned round and
lifted up his head again it all fell in a dusty fluff together over his
ears This give him a wild appearance similar to a blasted heath

O The chambermaid Ah He was turning something in his mind To
be sure Yes I wont go upstairs now if you will take my bag It
will be enough for the present to know my numberCan you give me 24 B

O Conscience what a Adder art thou

Mrs Pratchett allotted him the room and took his bag to it He then
went back before the fire and fell a biting his nails

Waiter biting between the words give me bite pen and paper and
in five minutes bite let me have if you please bite a bite
Messenger

Unmindful of his waning soup he wrote and sent off six notes before he
touched his dinner Three were City three WestEnd The City letters
were to Cornhill Ludgatehill and Farringdon Street The WestEnd
letters were to Great Marlborough Street New Burlington Street and
Piccadilly Everybody was systematically denied at every one of the six
places and there was not a vestige of any answer Our light porter
whispered to me when he came back with that report All Booksellers

But before then he had cleared off his dinner and his bottle of wine He
nowmark the concurrence with the document formerly given in
fullknocked a plate of biscuits off the table with his agitated elber
but without breakage and demanded boiling brandyandwater

Now fully convinced that it was Himself I perspired with the utmost
freedom When he became flushed with the heated stimulant referred to
he again demanded pen and paper and passed the succeeding two hours in
producing a manuscript which he put in the fire when completed He then
went up to bed attended by Mrs Pratchett Mrs Pratchett who was
aware of my emotions told me on coming down that she had noticed his
eye rolling into every corner of the passages and staircase as if in
search of his Luggage and that looking back as she shut the door of 24
B she perceived him with his coat already thrown off immersing himself
bodily under the bedstead like a chimleysweep before the application of
machinery

The next dayI forbear the horrors of that nightwas a very foggy day
in our part of London insomuch that it was necessary to light the Coffee
room gas We was still alone and no feverish words of mine can do
justice to the fitfulness of his appearance as he sat at No 4 table
increased by there being something wrong with the meter

Having again ordered his dinner he went out and was out for the best
part of two hours Inquiring on his return whether any of the answers
had arrived and receiving an unqualified negative his instant call was
for mulligatawny the cayenne pepper and orange brandy

Feeling that the mortal struggle was now at hand I also felt that I must
be equal to him and with that view resolved that whatever he took I
would take Behind my partition but keeping my eye on him over the
curtain I therefore operated on Mulligatawny Cayenne Pepper and Orange
Brandy And at a later period of the day when he again said Orange
Brandy I said so too in a lower tone to George my Second Lieutenant
my First was absent on leave who acts between me and the bar

Throughout that awful day he walked about the Coffeeroom continually
Often he came close up to my partition and then his eye rolled within
too evidently in search of any signs of his Luggage Halfpast six came
and I laid his cloth He ordered a bottle of old Brown I likewise
ordered a bottle of old Brown He drank his I drank mine as nearly as
my duties would permit glass for glass against his He topped with
coffee and a small glass I topped with coffee and a small glass He
dozed I dozed At last Waiterand he ordered his bill The
moment was now at hand when we two must be locked in the deadly grapple

Swift as the arrow from the bow I had formed my resolution in other
words I had hammered it out between nine and nine It was that I would
be the first to open up the subject with a full acknowledgment and would
offer any gradual settlement within my power He paid his bill doing
what was right by attendance with his eye rolling about him to the last
for any tokens of his Luggage One only time our gaze then met with the
lustrous fixedness I believe I am correct in imputing that character to
it of the wellknown Basilisk The decisive moment had arrived

With a tolerable steady hand though with humility I laid The Proofs
before him

Gracious Heavens he cries out leaping up and catching hold of his
hair Whats this Print

Sir I replied in a calming voice and bending forward I humbly
acknowledge to being the unfortunate cause of it But I hope sir that
when you have heard the circumstances explained and the innocence of my
intentions

To my amazement I was stopped short by his catching me in both his arms
and pressing me to his breastbone where I must confess to my face and
particular nose having undergone some temporary vexation from his
wearing his coat buttoned high up and his buttons being uncommon hard

Ha ha ha he cries releasing me with a wild laugh and grasping my
hand What is your name my Benefactor

My name sir I was crumpled and puzzled to make him out is
Christopher and I hope sir that as such when youve heard my ex

In print he exclaims again dashing the proofs over and over as if he
was bathing in themIn print O Christopher Philanthropist
Nothing can recompense youbut what sum of money would be acceptable to
you

I had drawn a step back from him or I should have suffered from his
buttons again

Sir I assure you I have been already well paid and

No no Christopher Dont talk like that What sum of money would be
acceptable to you Christopher Would you find twenty pounds acceptable
Christopher

However great my surprise I naturally found words to say Sir I am not
aware that the man was ever yet born without more than the average amount
of water on the brain as would not find twenty pounds acceptable
Butextremely obliged to you sir Im sure for he had tumbled it out
of his purse and crammed it in my hand in two banknotes but I could
wish to know sir if not intruding how I have merited this liberality

Know then my Christopher he says that from boyhoods hour I have
unremittingly and unavailingly endeavoured to get into print Know
Christopher that all the Booksellers aliveand several deadhave
refused to put me into print Know Christopher that I have written
unprinted Reams But they shall be read to you my friend and brother
You sometimes have a holiday

Seeing the great danger I was in I had the presence of mind to answer
Never To make it more final I added Never Not from the cradle to
the grave

Well says he thinking no more about that and chuckling at his proofs
again But I am in print The first flight of ambition emanating from
my fathers lowly cot is realised at length The golden bowhe was
getting onstruck by the magic hand has emitted a complete and
perfect sound When did this happen my Christopher

Which happen sir

This he held it out at arms length to admire itthis Perrint

When I had given him my detailed account of it he grasped me by the hand
again and said

Dear Christopher it should be gratifying to you to know that you are an
instrument in the hands of Destiny Because you _are_

A passing Something of a melancholy cast put it into my head to shake it
and to say Perhaps we all are

I dont mean that he answered I dont take that wide range I
confine myself to the special case Observe me well my Christopher
Hopeless of getting rid through any effort of my own of any of the
manuscripts among my Luggageall of which send them where I would
were always coming back to meit is now some seven years since I left
that Luggage here on the desperate chance either that the too too
faithful manuscripts would come back to me no more or that some one less
accursed than I might give them to the world You follow me my
Christopher

Pretty well sir I followed him so far as to judge that he had a weak
head and that the Orange the Boiling and Old Brown combined was
beginning to tell The Old Brown being heady is best adapted to
seasoned cases

Years elapsed and those compositions slumbered in dust At length
Destiny choosing her agent from all mankind sent You here Christopher
and lo the Casket was burst asunder and the Giant was free

He made hay of his hair after he said this and he stood atiptoe

But he reminded himself in a state of excitement we must sit up all
night my Christopher I must correct these Proofs for the press Fill
all the inkstands and bring me several new pens

He smeared himself and he smeared the Proofs the night through to that
degree that when Sol gave him warning to depart in a fourwheeler few
could have said which was them and which was him and which was blots
His last instructions was that I should instantly run and take his
corrections to the office of the present Journal I did so They most
likely will not appear in print for I noticed a message being brought
round from Beauford Printing House while I was a throwing this
concluding statement on paper that the ole resources of that
establishment was unable to make out what they meant Upon which a
certain gentleman in company as I will not more particularly namebut
of whom it will be sufficient to remark standing on the broad basis of a
wavegirt isle that whether we regard him in the light of3 laughed

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
