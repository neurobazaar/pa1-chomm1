CHAPTER I


GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF OUR VILLAGE AND THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE DIAMOND

When I came up to town for my second year my aunt Hoggarty made me a
present of a diamondpin that is to say it was not a diamondpin then
but a large oldfashioned locket of Dublin manufacture in the year 1795
which the late Mr Hoggarty used to sport at the Lord Lieutenants balls
and elsewhere He wore it he said at the battle of Vinegar Hill when
his club pigtail saved his head from being taken offbut that is
neither here nor there

In the middle of the brooch was Hoggarty in the scarlet uniform of the
corps of Fencibles to which he belonged around it were thirteen locks of
hair belonging to a bakers dozen of sisters that the old gentleman had
and as all these little ringlets partook of the family hue of brilliant
auburn Hoggartys portrait seemed to the fanciful view like a great fat
red round of beef surrounded by thirteen carrots These were dished up
on a plate of blue enamel and it was from the GREAT HOGGARTY DIAMOND as
we called it in the family that the collection of hairs in question
seemed as it were to spring

My aunt I need not say is rich and I thought I might be her heir as
well as another During my months holiday she was particularly pleased
with me made me drink tea with her often though there was a certain
person in the village with whom on those golden summer evenings I should
have liked to have taken a stroll in the hayfields promised every time
I drank her bohea to do something handsome for me when I went back to
townnay three or four times had me to dinner at three and to whist
or cribbage afterwards I did not care for the cards for though we
always played seven hours on a stretch and I always lost my losings
were never more than nineteenpence a night but there was some infernal
sour blackcurrant wine that the old lady always produced at dinner and
with the tray at ten oclock and which I dared not refuse though upon
my word and honour it made me very unwell

Well I thought after all this obsequiousness on my part and my aunts
repeated promises that the old lady would at least make me a present of
a score of guineas of which she had a power in the drawer and so
convinced was I that some such present was intended for me that a young
lady by the name of Miss Mary Smith with whom I had conversed on the
subject actually netted me a little green silk purse which she gave me
behind Hickss hayrick as you turn to the right up Churchyard
Lanewhich she gave me I say wrapped up in a bit of silver paper
There was something in the purse too if the truth must be known First
there was a thick curl of the glossiest blackest hair you ever saw in
your life and next there was threepence that is to say the half of a
silver sixpence hanging by a little necklace of blue riband Ah but I
knew where the other half of the sixpence was and envied that happy bit
of silver

The last day of my holiday I was obliged of course to devote to Mrs
Hoggarty My aunt was excessively gracious and by way of a treat
brought out a couple of bottles of the black currant of which she made
me drink the greater part At night when all the ladies assembled at her
party had gone off with their pattens and their maids Mrs Hoggarty who
had made a signal to me to stay first blew out three of the wax candles
in the drawingroom and taking the fourth in her hand went and unlocked
her escritoire

I can tell you my heart beat though I pretended to look quite
unconcerned

Sam my dear said she as she was fumbling with her keys take another
glass of Rosolio that was the name by which she baptised the cursed
beverage it will do you good I took it and you might have seen my
hand tremble as the bottle went clickclick against the glass By the
time I had swallowed it the old lady had finished her operations at the
bureau and was coming towards me the waxcandle bobbing in one hand and
a large parcel in the other

Nows the time thought I

Samuel my dear nephew said she your first name you received from
your sainted uncle my blessed husband and of all my nephews and nieces
you are the one whose conduct in life has most pleased me

When you consider that my aunt herself was one of seven married sisters
that all the Hoggarties were married in Ireland and mothers of numerous
children I must say that the compliment my aunt paid me was a very
handsome one

Dear aunt says I in a slow agitated voice I have often heard you
say there were seventythree of us in all and believe me I do think your
high opinion of me very complimentary indeed Im unworthy of itindeed
I am

As for those odious Irish people says my aunt rather sharply dont
speak of them I hate them and every one of their mothers the fact is
there had been a lawsuit about Hoggartys property but of all my other
kindred you Samuel have been the most dutiful and affectionate to me
Your employers in London give the best accounts of your regularity and
good conduct Though you have had eighty pounds a year a liberal
salary you have not spent a shilling more than your income as other
young men would and you have devoted your months holidays to your old
aunt who I assure you is grateful

Oh maam said I It was all that I could utter

Samuel continued she I promised you a present and here it is I
first thought of giving you money but you are a regular lad and dont
want it You are above money dear Samuel I give you what I value most
in lifethe pthe po the poortrait of my sainted Hoggarty tears
set in the locket which contains the valuable diamond that you have
often heard me speak of Wear it dear Sam for my sake and think of
that angel in heaven and of your dear Aunt Susy

She put the machine into my hands it was about the size of the lid of a
shavingbox and I should as soon have thought of wearing it as of
wearing a cockedhat and pigtail I was so disgusted and disappointed
that I really could not get out a single word

When I recovered my presence of mind a little I took the locket out of
the bit of paper the locket indeed it was as big as a barndoor
padlock and slowly put it into my shirt Thank you Aunt said I
with admirable raillery I shall always value this present for the sake
of you who gave it me and it will recall to me my uncle and my
thirteen aunts in Ireland

I dont want you to wear it in _that_ way shrieked Mrs Hoggarty
with the hair of those odious carroty women You must have their hair
removed

Then the locket will be spoiled Aunt

Well sir never mind the locket have it set afresh

Or suppose said I I put aside the setting altogether it is a little
too large for the present fashion and have the portrait of my uncle
framed and placed over my chimneypiece next to yours Its a sweet
miniature

That miniature said Mrs Hoggarty solemnly was the great Mulcahys
_chefdoeuvre_ pronounced _shy dewver_ a favourite word of my aunts
being with the words _bongtong_ and _ally mode de Parry_ the extent of
her French vocabulary You know the dreadful story of that poor poor
artist When he had finished that wonderful likeness for the late Mrs
Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty county Mayo she wore it in her bosom at the
Lord Lieutenants ball where she played a game of piquet with the
CommanderinChief What could have made her put the hair of her vulgar
daughters round Micks portrait I cant think but so it was as you see
it this day Madam says the CommanderinChief if that is not my
friend Mick Hoggarty Im a Dutchman Those were his Lordships very
words Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty took off the brooch and showed
it to him

Who is the artist says my Lord Its the most wonderful likeness I
ever saw in my life

Mulcahy says she of Ormonds Quay

Begad I patronise him says my Lord but presently his face darkened
and he gave back the picture with a dissatisfied air There is one
fault in that portrait said his Lordship who was a rigid
disciplinarian and I wonder that my friend Mick as a military man
should have overlooked it

Whats that says Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty

Madam he has been painted WITHOUT HIS SWORDBELT And he took up the
cards again in a passion and finished the game without saying a single
word

The news was carried to Mr Mulcahy the next day and that unfortunate
artist _went mad immediately_ He had set his whole reputation upon this
miniature and declared that it should be faultless Such was the effect
of the announcement upon his susceptible heart When Mrs Hoggarty died
your uncle took the portrait and always wore it himself His sisters
said it was for the sake of the diamond whereas ungrateful things it
was merely on account of their hair and his love for the fine arts As
for the poor artist my dear some people said it was the profuse use of
spirit that brought on delirium tremens but I dont believe it Take
another glass of Rosolio

The telling of this story always put my aunt into great goodhumour and
she promised at the end of it to pay for the new setting of the diamond
desiring me to take it on my arrival in London to the great jeweller Mr
Polonius and send her the bill The fact is said she that the gold
in which the thing is set is worth five guineas at the very least and
you can have the diamond reset for two However keep the remainder
dear Sam and buy yourself what you please with it

With this the old lady bade me adieu The clock was striking twelve as I
walked down the village for the story of Mulcahy always took an hour in
the telling and I went away not quite so downhearted as when the present
was first made to me After all thought I a diamondpin is a
handsome thing and will give me a _distingue_ air though my clothes be
never so shabbyand shabby they were without any doubt Well I
said three guineas which I shall have over will buy me a couple of
pairs of whatdyecallems of which _entre nous_ I was in great
want having just then done growing whereas my pantaloons were made a
good eighteen months before

Well I walked down the village my hands in my breeches pockets I had
poor Marys purse there having removed the little things which she gave
me the day before and placed themnever mind where but look you in
those days I had a heart and a warm one too I had Marys purse ready
for my aunts donation which never came and with my own little stock of
money besides that Mrs Hoggartys card parties had lessened by a good
fiveandtwenty shillings I calculated that after paying my fare I
should get to town with a couple of sevenshilling pieces in my pocket

I walked down the village at a deuce of a pace so quick that if the
thing had been possible I should have overtaken ten oclock that had
passed by me two hours ago when I was listening to Mrs Hs long
stories over her terrible Rosolio The truth is at ten I had an
appointment under a certain persons window who was to have been looking
at the moon at that hour with her pretty quilled nightcap on and her
blessed hair in papers

There was the window shut and not so much as a candle in it and though
I hemmed and hawed and whistled over the garden paling and sang a song
of which Somebody was very fond and even threw a pebble at the window
which hit it exactly at the opening of the latticeI woke no one except
a great brute of a housedog that yelled and howled and bounced so at
me over the rails that I thought every moment he would have had my nose
between his teeth

So I was obliged to go off as quickly as might be and the next morning
Mamma and my sisters made breakfast for me at four and at five came the
True Blue light sixinside postcoach to London and I got up on the
roof without having seen Mary Smith

As we passed the house it _did_ seem as if the window curtain in her
room was drawn aside just a little bit Certainly the window was open
and it had been shut the night before but away went the coach and the
village cottage and the churchyard and Hickss hayricks were soon out
of sight

    

My hi what a pin said a stableboy who was smoking a cigar to the
guard looking at me and putting his finger to his nose

The fact is that I had never undressed since my aunts party and being
uneasy in mind and having all my clothes to pack up and thinking of
something else had quite forgotten Mrs Hoggartys brooch which I had
stuck into my shirtfrill the night before




CHAPTER II


TELLS HOW THE DIAMOND IS BROUGHT UP TO LONDON AND PRODUCES WONDERFUL
EFFECTS BOTH IN THE CITY AND AT THE WEST END

The circumstances recorded in this story took place some score of years
ago when as the reader may remember there was a great mania in the
City of London for establishing companies of all sorts by which many
people made pretty fortunes

I was at this period as the truth must be known thirteenth clerk of
twentyfour young gents who did the immense business of the Independent
West Diddlesex Fire and Life Insurance Company at their splendid stone
mansion in Cornhill Mamma had sunk a sum of four hundred pounds in the
purchase of an annuity at this office which paid her no less than six
andthirty pounds a year when no other company in London would give her
more than twentyfour The chairman of the directors was the great Mr
Brough of the house of Brough and Hoff Crutched Friars Turkey
Merchants It was a new house but did a tremendous business in the fig
and sponge way and more in the Zante currant line than any other firm in
the City

Brough was a great man among the Dissenting connection and you saw his
name for hundreds at the head of every charitable society patronised by
those good people He had nine clerks residing at his office in Crutched
Friars he would not take one without a certificate from the schoolmaster
and clergyman of his native place strongly vouching for his morals and
doctrine and the places were so run after that he got a premium of four
or five hundred pounds with each young gent whom he made to slave for
ten hours a day and to whom in compensation he taught all the mysteries
of the Turkish business He was a great man on Change too and our
young chaps used to hear from the stockbrokers clerks we commonly dined
together at the Cock and Woolpack a respectable house where you get a
capital cut of meat bread vegetables cheese half a pint of porter
and a penny to the waiter for a shillingthe young stockbrokers used
to tell us of immense bargains in Spanish Greek and Columbians that
Brough made Hoff had nothing to do with them but stopped at home
minding exclusively the business of the house He was a young chap very
quiet and steady of the Quaker persuasion and had been taken into
partnership by Brough for a matter of thirty thousand pounds and a very
good bargain too I was told in the strictest confidence that the house
one year with another divided a good seven thousand pounds of which
Brough had half Hoff twosixths and the other sixth went to old Tudlow
who had been Mr Broughs clerk before the new partnership began Tudlow
always went about very shabby and we thought him an old miser One of
our gents Bob Swinney by name used to say that Tudlows share was all
nonsense and that Brough had it all but Bob was always too knowing by
half used to wear a green cutaway coat and had his free admission to
Covent Garden Theatre He was always talking down at the shop as we
called it it wasnt a shop but as splendid an office as any in
Cornhillhe was always talking about Vestris and Miss Tree and singing

 The bramble the bramble
 The jolly jolly bramble

one of Charles Kembles famous songs in Maid Marian a play that was
all the rage then taken from a famous storybook by one Peacock a clerk
in the India House and a precious good place he has too

When Brough heard how Master Swinney abused him and had his admission to
the theatre he came one day down to the office where we all were four
andtwenty of us and made one of the most beautiful speeches I ever
heard in my life He said that for slander he did not care contumely
was the lot of every public man who had austere principles of his own
and acted by them austerely but what he _did_ care for was the character
of every single gentleman forming a part of the Independent West
Diddlesex Association The welfare of thousands was in their keeping
millions of money were daily passing through their hands the Citythe
country looked upon them for order honesty and good example And if he
found amongst those whom he considered as his childrenthose whom he
loved as his own flesh and bloodthat that order was departed from that
that regularity was not maintained that that good example was not kept
up Mr B always spoke in this emphatic wayif he found his children
departing from the wholesome rules of morality religion and decorumif
he found in high or lowin the head clerk at six hundred a year down to
the porter who cleaned the stepsif he found the slightest taint of
dissipation he would cast the offender from himyea though he were his
own son he would cast him from him

As he spoke this Mr Brough burst into tears and we who didnt know
what was coming looked at each other as pale as parsnips all except
Swinney who was twelfth clerk and made believe to whistle When Mr B
had wiped his eyes and recovered himself he turned round and oh how my
heart thumped as he looked me full in the face How it was relieved
though when he shouted out in a thundering voice

Mr ROBERT SWINNEY

Sir to you says Swinney as cool as possible and some of the chaps
began to titter

Mr SWINNEY roared Brough in a voice still bigger than before when
you came into this officethis family sir for such it is as I am
proud to sayyou found threeandtwenty as pious and wellregulated
young men as ever laboured togetheras ever had confided to them the
wealth of this mighty capital and famous empire You found sir
sobriety regularity and decorum no profane songs were uttered in this
place sacred toto business no slanders were whispered against the
heads of the establishmentbut over them I pass I can afford sir to
pass them byno worldly conversation or foul jesting disturbed the
attention of these gentlemen or desecrated the peaceful scene of their
labours You found Christians and gentlemen sir

I paid for my place like the rest said Swinney Didnt my governor
take sha

Silence sir Your worthy father did take shares in this establishment
which will yield him one day an immense profit He _did_ take shares
sir or you never would have been here I glory in saying that every one
of my young friends around me has a father a brother a dear relative or
friend who is connected in a similar way with our glorious enterprise
and that not one of them is there but has an interest in procuring at a
liberal commission other persons to join the ranks of our Association
_But_ sir I am its chief You will find sir your appointment signed
by me and in like manner I John Brough annul it Go from us
sirleave usquit a family that can no longer receive you in its
bosom Mr Swinney I have weptI have prayed sir before I came to
this determination I have taken counsel sir and am resolved _Depart
from out of us_

Not without three months salary though Mr B that cock wont
fight

They shall be paid to your father sir

My father be hanged I tell you what Brough Im of age and if you
dont pay me my salary Ill arrest youby Jingo I will Ill have
you in quod or my names not Bob Swinney

Make out a cheque Mr Roundhand for the three months salary of this
perverted young man

Twentyone pun five Roundhand and nothing for the stamp cried out
that audacious Swinney There it is sir _re_ceipted You neednt
cross it to my bankers And if any of you gents like a glass of punch
this evening at eight oclock Bob Swinneys your man and nothing to
pay If Mr Brough _would_ do me the honour to come in and take a whack
Come dont say no if youd rather not

We couldnt stand this impudence and all burst out laughing like mad

Leave the room yelled Mr Brough whose face had turned quite blue
and so Bob took his white hat off the peg and strolled away with his
tile as he called it very much on one side When he was gone Mr
Brough gave us another lecture by which we all determined to profit and
going up to Roundhands desk put his arm round his neck and looked over
the ledger

What money has been paid in today Roundhand he said in a very kind
way

The widow sir came with her money nine hundred and four ten and
sixsay 904_l_ 10_s_ 6_d_ Captain Sparr sir paid his shares up
grumbles though and says hes no more fifty shares two
instalmentsthree fifties sir

Hes always grumbling

He says he has not a shilling to bless himself with until our dividend
day

Any more

Mr Roundhand went through the book and made it up nineteen hundred
pounds in all We were doing a famous business now though when I came
into the office we used to sit and laugh and joke and read the
newspapers all day bustling into our seats whenever a stray customer
came Brough never cared about our laughing and singing _then_ and was
hand and glove with Bob Swinney but that was in early times before we
were well in harness

Nineteen hundred pounds and a thousand pounds in shares Bravo
Roundhandbravo gentlemen Remember every share you bring in brings
you five per cent down on the nail Look to your friendsstick to your
desksbe regularI hope none of you forget church Who takes Mr
Swinneys place

Mr Samuel Titmarsh sir

Mr Titmarsh I congratulate you Give me your hand sir you are now
twelfth clerk of this Association and your salary is consequently
increased five pounds a year How is your worthy mother siryour dear
and excellent parent In good health I trust And longlong I
fervently pray may this office continue to pay her annuity Remember
if she has more money to lay out there is higher interest than the last
for her for she is a year older and five per cent for you my boy Why
not you as well as another Young men will be young men and a tenpound
note does no harm Does it Mr Abednego

Oh no says Abednego who was third clerk and who was the chap that
informed against Swinney and he began to laugh as indeed we all did
whenever Mr Brough made anything like a joke not that they _were_
jokes only we used to know it by his face

Oh bythebye Roundhand says he a word with you on business Mrs
Brough wants to know why the deuce you never come down to Fulham

Law thats very polite said Mr Roundhand quite pleased

Name your day my boy Say Saturday and bring your nightcap with
you

Youre very polite Im sure I should be delighted beyond anything
but

Butno buts my boy Hark ye the Chancellor of the Exchequer does me
the honour to dine with us and I want you to see him for the truth is
I have bragged about you to his Lordship as the best actuary in the three
kingdoms

Roundhand could not refuse such an invitation as _that_ though he had
told us how Mrs R and he were going to pass Saturday and Sunday at
Putney and we who knew what a life the poor fellow led were sure that
the head clerk would be prettily scolded by his lady when she heard what
was going on She disliked Mrs Brough very much that was the fact
because Mrs B kept a carriage and said she didnt know where
Pentonville was and couldnt call on Mrs Roundhand Though to be
sure her coachman might have found out the way

And oh Roundhand continued our governor draw a cheque for seven
hundred will you Come dont stare man Im not going to run away
Thats rightseven hundredand ninety say while youre about it Our
board meets on Saturday and never fear Ill account for it to them
before I drive you down We shall take up the Chancellor at Whitehall

So saying Mr Brough folded up the cheque and shaking hands with Mr
Roundhand very cordially got into his carriageandfour he always drove
four horses even in the City where its so difficult which was waiting
at the officedoor for him

Bob Swinney used to say that he charged two of the horses to the Company
but there was never believing half of what that Bob said he used to
laugh and joke so I dont know how it was but I and a gent by the name
of Hoskins eleventh clerk who lived together with me in Salisbury
Square Fleet Streetwhere we occupied a very genteel twopairfound
our flute duet rather tiresome that evening and as it was a very fine
night strolled out for a walk West End way When we arrived opposite
Covent Garden Theatre we found ourselves close to the Globe Tavern and
recollected Bob Swinneys hospitable invitation We never fancied that
he had meant the invitation in earnest but thought we might as well look
in at any rate there could be no harm in doing so

There to be sure in the back drawingroom where he said he would be
we found Bob at the head of a table and in the midst of a great smoke of
cigars and eighteen of our gents rattling and banging away at the table
with the bottoms of their glasses

What a shout they made as we came in Hurray says Bob heres two
more Two more chairs Mary two more tumblers two more hot waters and
two more goes of gin Who would have thought of seeing Tit in the name
of goodness

Why said I we only came in by the merest chance

At this word there was another tremendous roar and it is a positive
fact that every man of the eighteen had said he came by chance However
chance gave us a very jovial night and that hospitable Bob Swinney paid
every shilling of the score

Gentlemen says he as he paid the bill Ill give you the health of
John Brough Esquire and thanks to him for the present of 21_l_ 5_s_
which he made me this morning What do I say21_l_ 5_s_ That and a
months salary that I should have had to payforfeitdown on the nail
by Jingo for leaving the shop as I intended to do tomorrow morning
Ive got a placea tiptop place I tell you Five guineas a week six
journeys a year my own horse and gig and to travel in the West of
England in oil and spermaceti Heres confusion to gas and the health
of Messrs Gann and Co of Thames Street in the City of London

I have been thus particular in my account of the West Diddlesex Insurance
Office and of Mr Brough the managing director though the real names
are neither given to the office nor to the chairman as you may be sure
because the fate of me and my diamond pin was mysteriously bound up with
both as I am about to show

You must know that I was rather respected among our gents at the West
Diddlesex because I came of a better family than most of them had
received a classical education and especially because I had a rich aunt
Mrs Hoggarty about whom as must be confessed I used to boast a good
deal There is no harm in being respected in this world as I have found
out and if you dont brag a little for yourself depend on it there is
no person of your acquaintance who will tell the world of your merits
and take the trouble off your hands

So that when I came back to the office after my visit at home and took
my seat at the old daybook opposite the dingy window that looks into
Birchin Lane I pretty soon let the fellows know that Mrs Hoggarty
though she had not given me a large sum of money as I expectedindeed
I had promised a dozen of them a treat down the river should the
promised riches have come to meI let them know I say that though my
aunt had not given me any money she had given me a splendid diamond
worth at least thirty guineas and that some day I would sport it at the
shop

Oh lets see it says Abednego whose father was a mockjewel and gold
lace merchant in Hanway Yard and I promised that he should have a sight
of it as soon as it was set As my pocketmoney was run out too by
coachhire to and from home five shillings to our maid at home ten to
my aunts maid and man fiveandtwenty shillings lost at whist as I
said and fifteenandsix paid for a silver scissors for the dear little
fingers of Somebody Roundhand who was very goodnatured asked me to
dine and advanced me 7_l_ 1_s_ 8_d_ a months salary It was at
Roundhands house Myddelton Square Pentonville over a fillet of veal
and bacon and a glass of port that I learned and saw how his wife ill
treated him as I have told before Poor fellowwe underclerks all
thought it was a fine thing to sit at a desk by oneself and have 50_l_
per month as Roundhand had but Ive a notion that Hoskins and I
blowing duets on the flute together in our second floor in Salisbury
Square were a great deal more at ease than our headand more _in
harmony_ too though we made sad work of the music certainly

One day Gus Hoskins and I asked leave from Roundhand to be off at three
oclock as we had _particular business_ at the West End He knew it was
about the great Hoggarty diamond and gave us permission so off we set
When we reached St Martins Lane Gus got a cigar to give himself as it
were a _distingue_ air and pulled at it all the way up the Lane and
through the alleys into Coventry Street where Mr Poloniuss shop is as
everybody knows

The door was open and a number of carriages full of ladies were drawing
up and setting down Gus kept his hands in his pocketstrousers were
worn very full then with large tucks and pigeonholes for your boots
or Bluchers to come through the fashionables wore boots but we chaps
in the City on 80_l_ a year contented ourselves with Bluchers and as
Gus stretched out his pantaloons as wide as he could from his hips and
kept blowing away at his cheroot and clamping with the iron heels of his
boots and had very large whiskers for so young a man he really looked
quite the genteel thing and was taken by everybody to be a person of
consideration

He would not come into the shop though but stood staring at the gold
pots and kettles in the window outside I went in and after a little
hemming and hawingfor I had never been at such a fashionable place
beforeasked one of the gentlemen to let me speak to Mr Polonius

What can I do for you sir says Mr Polonius who was standing close
by as it happened serving three ladiesa very old one and two young
ones who were examining pearl necklaces very attentively

Sir said I producing my jewel out of my coatpocket this jewel has
I believe been in your house before it belonged to my aunt Mrs
Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty The old lady standing near looked round
as I spoke

I sold her a gold neckchain and repeating watch in the year 1795 said
Mr Polonius who made it a point to recollect everything and a silver
punchladle to the Captain How is the MajorColonelGeneraleh
sir

The General said I I am sorry to saythough I was quite proud that
this man of fashion should address me soMr Hoggarty isno more My
aunt has made me a present however of thisthis trinketwhich as you
see contains her husbands portrait that I will thank you sir to
preserve for me very carefully and she wishes that you would set this
diamond neatly

Neatly and handsomely of course sir

Neatly in the present fashion and send down the account to her There
is a great deal of gold about the trinket for which of course you will
make an allowance

To the last fraction of a sixpence says Mr Polonius bowing and
looking at the jewel Its a wonderful piece of goods certainly said
he though the diamonds a neat little bit certainly Do my Lady
look at it The thing is of Irish manufacture bears the stamp of 95
and will recall perhaps the times of your Ladyships earliest youth

Get ye out Mr Polonius said the old lady a little wizenfaced old
lady with her face puckered up in a million of wrinkles How _dar_
you sir to talk such nonsense to an old woman like me Wasnt I fifty
years old in 95 and a grandmother in 96 She put out a pair of
withered trembling hands took up the locket examined it for a minute
and then burst out laughing As I live its the great Hoggarty
diamond

Good heavens what was this talisman that had come into my possession

Look girls continued the old lady this is the great jewl of all
Ireland This redfaced man in the middle is poor Mick Hoggarty a
cousin of mine who was in love with me in the year 84 when I had just
lost your poor dear grandpapa These thirteen sthreamers of red hair
represent his thirteen celebrated sistersBiddy Minny Thedy Widdy
short for Williamina Freddy Izzy Tizzy Mysie Grizzy Polly Dolly
Nell and Bellall married all ugly and all carrty hair And of
which are you the son young manthough to do you justice youre not
like the family

Two pretty young ladies turned two pretty pairs of black eyes at me and
waited for an answer which they would have had only the old lady began
rattling on a hundred stories about the thirteen ladies above named and
all their lovers all their disappointments and all the duels of Mick
Hoggarty She was a chronicle of fiftyyearsold scandal At last she
was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing at the conclusion of which
Mr Polonius very respectfully asked me where he should send the pin and
whether I would like the hair kept

No says I never mind the hair

And the pin sir

I had felt ashamed about telling my address But bang it thought I
why _should_ I

 A king can make a belted knight
 A marquess duke and a that
 An honest mans abune his might
 Gude faith he canna fa that

Why need I care about telling these ladies where I live

Sir says I have the goodness to send the parcel when done to Mr
Titmarsh No 3 Bell Lane Salisbury Square near St Brides Church
Fleet Street Ring if you please the twopair bell

_What_ sir said Mr Polonius

_Hwat_ shrieked the old lady Mr Hwat Mais ma chere cest
impayable Come alongheres the carrage Give me your arm Mr Hwat
and get inside and tell me all about your thirteen aunts

She seized on my elbow and hobbled through the shop as fast as possible
the young ladies following her laughing

Now jump in do you hear said she poking her sharp nose out of the
window

I cant maam says I I have a friend

Pooh pooh send um to the juice and jump in And before almost I
could say a word a great powdered fellow in yellowplush breeches pushed
me up the steps and banged the door to

I looked just for one minute as the barouche drove away at Hoskins and
never shall forget his figure There stood Gus his mouth wide open his
eyes staring a smoking cheroot in his hand wondering with all his might
at the strange thing that had just happened to me

Who _is_ that Titmarsh says Gus theres a coronet on the carriage

CHAPTER III


HOW THE POSSESSOR OF THE DIAMOND IS WHISKED INTO A MAGNIFICENT CHARIOT
AND HAS YET FURTHER GOOD LUCK

I sat on the back seat of the carriage near a very nice young lady
about my dear Marys agethat is to say seventeen and threequarters
and opposite us sat the old Countess and her other
granddaughterhandsome too but ten years older I recollect I had on
that day my blue coat and brass buttons nankeen trousers a white sprig
waistcoat and one of Dandos silk hats that had just come in in the
year 22 and looked a great deal more glossy than the best beaver

And who was that hidjus mansterthat was the way her Ladyship
pronouncedthat ojous vulgar wretch with the iron heels to his boots
and the big mouth and the imitation goold neckchain who _steered_ at
us so as we got into the carriage

How she should have known that Guss chain was mosaic I cant tell but
so it was and we had bought it for fiveandtwenty and sixpence only the
week before at MPhails in St Pauls Churchyard But I did not like
to hear my friend abused and so spoke out for him

Maam says I that young gentlemans name is Augustus Hoskins We
live together and a better or more kindhearted fellow does not exist

You are quite right to stand up for your friends sir said the second
lady whose name it appears was Lady Jane but whom the grandmamma
called Lady Jene

Well upon me conscience so he is now Lady Jene and I like spert in
a young man So his name is Hoskins is it I know my dears all the
Hoskinses in England There are the Lincolnshire Hoskinses the
Shropshire Hoskinses they say the Admirals daughter Bell was in love
with a black footman or boatswain or some such thing but the worlds
so censorious Theres old Doctor Hoskins of Bath who attended poor
dear Drum in the quinsy and poor dear old Fred Hoskins the gouty
General I remember him as thin as a lath in the year 84 and as active
as a harlequin and in love with meoh how he was in love with me

You seem to have had a host of admirers in those days Grandmamma said
Lady Jane

Hundreds my dearhundreds of thousands I was the toast of Bath and
a great beauty too would you ever have thought it now upon your
conscience and without flattery MraWhatdyecallim

Indeed maam I never should I answered for the old lady was as ugly
as possible and at my saying this the two young ladies began screaming
with laughter and I saw the two greatwhiskered footmen grinning over
the back of the carriage

Upon my word youre mighty candid Mr Whatsyournamemighty candid
indeed but I like candour in young people But a beauty I was Just
ask your friends uncle the General Hes one of the Lincolnshire
HoskinsesI knew he was by the strong family likeness Is he the eldest
son Its a pretty property though sadly encumbered for old Sir George
was the divvle of a mana friend of Hanbury Williams and Lyttleton and
those horrid monstrous ojous people How much will he have now
mister when the Admiral dies

Why maam I cant say but the Admiral is not my friends father

Not his fatherbut he _is_ I tell you and Im never wrong Who is
his father then

Maam Guss fathers a leatherseller in Skinner Street Snow Hilla
very respectable house maam But Gus is only third son and so cant
expect a great share in the property

The two young ladies smiled at thisthe old lady said Hwat

I like you sir Lady Jane said for not being ashamed of your
friends whatever their rank of life may be Shall we have the pleasure
of setting you down anywhere Mr Titmarsh

Noways particular my Lady says I We have a holiday at our office
todayat least Roundhand gave me and Gus leave and I shall be very
happy indeed to take a drive in the Park if its no offence

Im sure it will give usinfinite pleasure said Lady Jane though
rather in a grave way

Oh that it will says Lady Fanny clapping her hands wont it
Grandmamma And after we have been in the Park we can walk in
Kensington Gardens if Mr Titmarsh will be good enough to accompany us

Indeed Fanny we will do no such thing says Lady Jane

Indeed but we will though shrieked out Lady Drum Aint I dying to
know everything about his uncle and thirteen aunts and youre all
chattering so you young women that not a blessed syllable will you
allow me or my young friend here to speak

Lady Jane gave a shrug with her shoulders and did not say a single word
more Lady Fanny who was as gay as a young kitten if I may be allowed
so to speak of the aristocracy laughed and blushed and giggled and
seemed quite to enjoy her sisters illhumour And the Countess began at
once and entered into the history of the thirteen Misses Hoggarty which
was not near finished when we entered the Park

When there you cant think what hundreds of gents on horseback came to
the carriage and talked to the ladies They had their joke for Lady
Drum who seemed to be a character in her way their bow for Lady Jane
and the young ones especially their compliment for Lady Fanny

Though she bowed and blushed as a young lady should Lady Fanny seemed
to be thinking of something else for she kept her head out of the
carriage looking eagerly among the horsemen as if she expected to see
somebody Aha my Lady Fanny _I_ knew what it meant when a young pretty
lady like you was absent and on the lookout and only half answered the
questions put to her Let alone Sam Titmarshhe knows what Somebody
means as well as another I warrant As I saw these manoeuvres going on
I could not help just giving a wink to Lady Jane as much as to say I
knew what was what I guess the young lady is looking for Somebody
says I It was then her turn to look queer I assure you and she
blushed as red as scarlet but after a minute the goodnatured little
thing looked at her sister and both the young ladies put their
handkerchiefs up to their faces and began laughinglaughing as if I had
said the funniest thing in the world

Il est charmant votre monsieur said Lady Jane to her grandmamma and
on which I bowed and said Madame vous me faites beaucoup dhonneur
for I know the French language and was pleased to find that these good
ladies had taken a liking to me Im a poor humble lad maam not used
to London society and do really feel it quite kind of you to take me by
the hand so and give me a drive in your fine carriage

At this minute a gentleman on a black horse with a pale face and a tuft
to his chin came riding up to the carriage and I knew by a little start
that Lady Fanny gave and by her instantly looking round the other way
that _Somebody_ was come at last

Lady Drum said he your most devoted servant I have just been
riding with a gentleman who almost shot himself for love of the beautiful
Countess of Drum in the yearnever mind the year

Was it Killblazes said the lady hes a dear old man and Im quite
ready to go off with him this minute Or was it that delight of an old
bishop Hes got a lock of my hair nowI gave it him when he was Papas
chaplain and let me tell you it would be a hard matter to find another
now in the same place

Law my Lady says I you dont say so

But indeed I do my good sir says she for between ourselves my
heads as bare as a cannonballask Fanny if it isnt Such a fright as
the poor thing got when she was a babby and came upon me suddenly in my
dressingroom without my wig

I hope Lady Fanny has recovered from the shock said Somebody
looking first at her and then at me as if he had a mind to swallow me
And would you believe it all that Lady Fanny could say was Pretty
well I thank you my Lord and she said this with as much fluttering
and blushing as we used to say our Virgil at schoolwhen we hadnt
learned it

My Lord still kept on looking very fiercely at me and muttered something
about having hoped to find a seat in Lady Drums carriage as he was
tired of riding on which Lady Fanny muttered something too about a
friend of Grandmammas

You should say a friend of yours Fanny says Lady Jane I am sure we
should never have come to the Park if Fanny had not insisted upon
bringing Mr Titmarsh hither Let me introduce the Earl of Tiptoff to
Mr Titmarsh But instead of taking off his hat as I did mine his
Lordship growled out that he hoped for another opportunity and galloped
off again on his black horse Why the deuce I should have offended him I
never could understand

But it seemed as if I was destined to offend all the men that day for
who should presently come up but the Right Honourable Edmund Preston one
of His Majestys Secretaries of State as I know very well by the almanac
in our office and the husband of Lady Jane

The Right Honourable Edmund was riding a grey cob and was a fat pale
faced man who looked as if he never went into the open air Who the
devils that said he to his wife looking surlily both at me and her

Oh its a friend of Grandmammas and Janes said Lady Fanny at once
looking like a sly rogue as she was quite archly at her sisterwho in
her turn appeared quite frightened and looked imploringly at her sister
and never dared to breathe a syllable Yes indeed continued Lady
Fanny Mr Titmarsh is a cousin of Grandmammas by the mothers side by
the Hoggarty side Didnt you know the Hoggarties when you were in
Ireland Edmund with Lord Bagwig Let me introduce you to Grandmammas
cousin Mr Titmarsh Mr Titmarsh my brother Mr Edmund Preston

There was Lady Jane all the time treading upon her sisters foot as hard
as possible and the little wicked thing would take no notice and I who
had never heard of the cousinship feeling as confounded as could be But
I did not know the Countess of Drum near so well as that sly minx her
granddaughter did for the old lady who had just before called poor Gus
Hoskins her cousin had it appeared the mania of fancying all the world
related to her and said

Yes were cousins and not very far removed Mick Hoggartys
grandmother was Millicent Brady and she and my Aunt Towzer were related
as all the world knows for Decimus Brady of Ballybrady married an own
cousin of Aunt Towzers mother Bell Swiftthat was no relation of the
Deans my love who came but of a soso familyand isnt _that_ clear

Oh perfectly Grandmamma said Lady Jane laughing while the right
honourable gent still rode by us looking sour and surly

And sure you knew the Hoggarties Edmundthe thirteen redhaired
girlsthe nine graces and four over as poor Clanboy used to call them
Poor Clana cousin of yours and mine Mr Titmarsh and sadly in love
with me he was too Not remember them _all_ now Edmundnot
remembernot remember Biddy and Minny and Thedy and Widdy and Mysie
and Grizzy and Polly and Dolly and the rest

D the Miss Hoggarties maam said the right honourable gent and he
said it with such energy that his grey horse gave a sudden lash out that
well nigh sent him over his head Lady Jane screamed Lady Fanny
laughed old Lady Drum looked as if she did not care twopence and said
Serve you right for swearing you ojous man you

Hadnt you better come into the carriage EdmundMr Preston cried
out the lady anxiously

Oh Im sure Ill slip out maam says I

Poohpooh dont stir said Lady Drum its my carriage and if Mr
Preston chooses to swear at a lady of my years in that ojous vulgar
wayin that ojous vulgar way I repeatI dont see why my friends should
be inconvenienced for him Let him sit on the dicky if he likes or come
in and ride bodkin It was quite clear that my Lady Drum hated her
grandsoninlaw heartily and Ive remarked somehow in families that this
kind of hatred is by no means uncommon

Mr Preston one of His Majestys Secretaries of State was to tell the
truth in a great fright upon his horse and was glad to get away from
the kicking plunging brute His pale face looked still paler than
before and his hands and legs trembled as he dismounted from the cob
and gave the reins to his servant I disliked the looks of the chapof
the master I meanat the first moment he came up when he spoke rudely
to that nice gentle wife of his and I thought he was a cowardly fellow
as the adventure of the cob showed him to be Heaven bless you a baby
could have ridden it and here was the man with his soul in his mouth at
the very first kick

Oh quick _do_ come in Edmund said Lady Fanny laughing and the
carriage steps being let down and giving me a great scowl as he came in
he was going to place himself in Lady Fannys corner I warrant you I
wouldnt budge from mine when the little rogue cried out Oh no by
no means Mr Preston Shut the door Thomas And oh what fun it will
be to show all the world a Secretary of State riding bodkin

And pretty glum the Secretary of State looked I assure you

Take my place Edmund and dont mind Fannys folly said Lady Jane
timidly

Oh no Pray madam dont stir Im comfortable very comfortable and
so I hope is this Mrthis gentleman

Perfectly I assure you says I I was going to offer to ride your
horse home for you as you seemed to be rather frightened at it but the
fact was I was so comfortable here that really I _couldnt_ move

Such a grin as old Lady Drum gave when I said thathow her little eyes
twinkled and her little sly mouth puckered up I couldnt help
speaking for look you my blood was up

We shall always be happy of your company Cousin Titmarsh says she
and handed me a gold snuffbox out of which I took a pinch and sneezed
with the air of a lord

As you have invited this gentleman into your carriage Lady Jane
Preston hadnt you better invite him home to dinner says Mr Preston
quite blue with rage

I invited him into my carriage says the old lady and as we are going
to dine at your house and you press it Im sure I shall be very happy
to see him there

Im very sorry Im engaged said I

Oh indeed what a pity says Right Honourable Ned still glowering at
his wife What a pity that this gentlemanI forget his namethat your
friend Lady Jane is engaged I am sure you would have had such
gratification in meeting your relation in Whitehall

Lady Drum was overfond of finding out relations to be sure but this
speech of Right Honourable Neds was rather too much Now Sam says
I be a man and show your spirit So I spoke up at once and said
Why ladies as the right honourable gent is so _very_ pressing Ill
give up my engagement and shall have sincere pleasure in cutting mutton
with him Whats your hour sir

He didnt condescend to answer and for me I did not care for you see
I did not intend to dine with the man but only to give him a lesson of
manners For though I am but a poor fellow and hear people cry out how
vulgar it is to eat peas with a knife or ask three times for cheese and
such like points of ceremony theres something I think much more
vulgar than all this and that is insolence to ones inferiors I hate
the chap that uses it as I scorn him of humble rank that affects to be
of the fashion and so I determined to let Mr Preston know a piece of my
mind

When the carriage drove up to his house I handed out the ladies as
politely as possible and walked into the hall and then taking hold of
Mr Prestons button at the door I said before the ladies and the two
big servantsupon my word I didSir says I this kind old lady
asked me into her carriage and I rode in it to please her not myself
When you came up and asked who the devil I was I thought you might have
put the question in a more polite manner but it wasnt my business to
speak When by way of a joke you invited me to dinner I thought I
would answer in a joke too and here I am But dont be frightened Im
not agoing to dine with you only if you play the same joke upon other
partieson some of the chaps in our office for exampleI recommend you
to have a care or they will _take you at your word_

Is that all sir says Mr Preston still in a rage If you have
done will you leave this house or shall my servants turn you out Turn
out this fellow do you hear me and he broke away from me and flung
into his study in a rage

Hes an ojous horrid monsther of a man that husband of yours said
Lady Drum seizing hold of her elder granddaughters arm and I hate
him and so come away for the dinnerll be getting cold and she was
for hurrying away Lady Jane without more ado But that kind lady coming
forward looking very pale and trembling said Mr Titmarsh I do hope
youll not be angrythat is that youll forget what has happened for
believe me it has given me very great

Very great what I never could say for here the poor things eyes filled
with tears and Lady Drum crying out Tut tut none of this nonsense
pulled her away by the sleeve and went upstairs But little Lady Fanny
walked boldly up to me and held me out her little hand and gave mine
such a squeeze and said Goodbye my dear Mr Titmarsh so very
kindly that Im blest if I did not blush up to the ears and all the
blood in my body began to tingle

So when she was gone I clapped my hat on my head and walked out of the
halldoor feeling as proud as a peacock and as brave as a lion and all
I wished for was that one of those saucy grinning footmen should say or
do something to me that was the least uncivil so that I might have the
pleasure of knocking him down with my best compliments to his master
But neither of them did me any such favour and I went away and dined at
home off boiled mutton and turnips with Gus Hoskins quite peacefully

I did not think it was proper to tell Gus who between ourselves is
rather curious and inclined to tittletattle all the particulars of the
family quarrel of which I had been the cause and witness and so just
said that the old ladyThey were the Drum arms says Gus for I went
and looked them out that minute in the Peeragethat the old lady
turned out to be a cousin of mine and that she had taken me to drive in
the Park Next day we went to the office as usual when you may be sure
that Hoskins told everything of what had happened and a great deal more
and somehow though I did not pretend to care sixpence about the matter
I must confess that I _was_ rather pleased that the gents in our office
should hear of a part of my adventure

But fancy my surprise on coming home in the evening to find Mrs Stokes
the landlady Miss Selina Stokes her daughter and Master Bob Stokes her
son an idle young vagabond that was always playing marbles on St
Brides steps and in Salisbury Squarewhen I found them all bustling
and tumbling up the steps before me to our rooms on the second floor and
there on the table between our two flutes on one side my album Guss
Don Juan and Peerage on the other I saw as follows

1 A basket of great red peaches looking like the cheeks of my dear
Mary Smith

2 A ditto of large fat luscious heavylooking grapes

3 An enormous piece of raw mutton as I thought it was but Mrs Stokes
said it was the primest haunch of venison that ever she saw

And three cardsviz

DOWAGER COUNTESS OF DRUM
LADY FANNY RAKES

MR PRESTON
LADY JANE PRESTON

EARL OF TIPTOFF

Sich a carriage says Mrs Stokes for that was the way the poor thing
spoke Sich a carriageall over coronites sich liveriestwo great
footmen with red whiskers and yellowplush smallclothes and inside a
very old lady in a white poke bonnet and a young one with a great
Leghorn hat and blue ribands and a great tall pale gentleman with a tuft
on his chin

Pray madam does Mr Titmarsh live here says the young lady with
her clear voice

Yes my Lady says I but hes at the officethe West Diddlesex Fire
and Life Office Cornhill

Charles get out the things says the gentleman quite solemn

Yes my Lord says Charles and brings me out the haunch in a
newspaper and on the chany dish as you see it and the two baskets of
fruit besides

Have the kindness madam says my Lord to take these things to Mr
Titmarshs rooms with our with Lady Jane Prestons compliments and
request his acceptance of them and then he pulled out the cards on your
table and this letter sealed with his Lordships own crown

And herewith Mrs Stokes gave me a letter which my wife keeps to this
day by the way and which runs thus

 The Earl of Tiptoff has been commissioned by Lady Jane Preston to
 express her sincere regret and disappointment that she was not able
 yesterday to enjoy the pleasure of Mr Titmarshs company Lady Jane
 is about to leave town immediately she will therefore be unable to
 receive her friends in Whitehall Place this season But Lord Tiptoff
 trusts that Mr Titmarsh will have the kindness to accept some of the
 produce of her Ladyships garden and park with which perhaps he
 will entertain some of those friends in whose favour he knows so well
 how to speak

Along with this was a little note containing the words Lady Drum at
home Friday evening June 17 And all this came to me because my aunt
Hoggarty had given me a diamondpin

I did not send back the venison as why should I Gus was for sending it
at once to Brough our director and the grapes and peaches to my aunt in
Somersetshire

But no says I well ask Bob Swinney and halfadozen more of our
gents and well have a merry night of it on Saturday And a merry
night we had too and as we had no wine in the cupboard we had plenty of
ale and ginpunch afterwards And Gus sat at the foot of the table and
I at the head and we sang songs both comic and sentimental and drank
toasts and I made a speech that there is no possibility of mentioning
here because _entre nous_ I had quite forgotten in the morning
everything that had taken place after a certain period on the night
before




CHAPTER IV


HOW THE HAPPY DIAMONDWEARER DINES AT PENTONVILLE

I did not go to the office till halfanhour after opening time on
Monday If the truth must be told I was not sorry to let Hoskins have
the start of me and tell the chaps what had taken placefor we all
have our little vanities and I liked to be thought well of by my
companions

When I came in I saw my business had been done by the way in which the
chaps looked at me especially Abednego who offered me a pinch out of
his gold snuffbox the very first thing Roundhand shook me too warmly
by the hand when he came round to look over my daybook said I wrote a
capital hand and indeed I believe I do without any sort of flattery
and invited me for dinner next Sunday in Myddelton Square You wont
have said he quite such a grand turnout as with _your friends at the
West End_he said this with a particular accentbut Amelia and I are
always happy to see a friend in our plain waypale sherry old port
and cut and come again Hey

I said I would come and bring Hoskins too

He answered that I was very polite and that he should be very happy to
see Hoskins and we went accordingly at the appointed day and hour but
though Gus was eleventh clerk and I twelfth I remarked that at dinner I
was helped first and best I had twice as many forcemeat balls as
Hoskins in my mockturtle and pretty nearly all the oysters out of the
sauceboat Once Roundhand was going to help Gus before me when his
wife who was seated at the head of the table looking very big and
fierce in red crape and a turban shouted out ANTONY and poor R
dropped the plate and blushed as red as anything How Mrs R did talk
to me about the West End to be sure She had a Peerage as you may be
certain and knew everything about the Drum family in a manner that quite
astonished me She asked me how much Lord Drum had a year whether I
thought he had twenty thirty forty or a hundred and fifty thousand a
year whether I was invited to Drum Castle what the young ladies wore
and if they had those odious _gigot_ sleeves which were just coming in
then and here Mrs R looked at a pair of large mottled arms that she
was very proud of

I say Sam my boy cried in the midst of our talk Mr Roundhand who
had been passing the portwine round pretty freely I hope you looked to
the main chance and put in a few shares of the West Diddlesexhey

Mr Roundhand have you put up the decanters downstairs cries the
lady quite angry and wishing to stop the conversation

No Milly Ive emptied em says R

Dont Milly me sir and have the goodness to go down and tell Lancy my
maid _a look at me_ to make the tea in the study We have a
gentleman here who is not _used_ to Pentonville ways _another look_
but he wont mind the ways of _friends_ And here Mrs Roundhand
heaved her very large chest and gave me a third look that was so severe
that I declare to goodness it made me look quite foolish As to Gus she
never so much as spoke to him all the evening but he consoled himself
with a great lot of muffins and sat most of the evening it was a cruel
hot summer whistling and talking with Roundhand on the verandah I
think I should like to have been with themfor it was very close in the
room with that great big Mrs Roundhand squeezing close up to one on the
sofa

Do you recollect what a jolly night we had here last summer I heard
Hoskins say who was leaning over the balcony and ogling the girls
coming home from church You and me with our coats off plenty of cold
rumandwater Mrs Roundhand at Margate and a whole box of Manillas

Hush said Roundhand quite eagerly Milly will hear

But Milly didnt hear for she was occupied in telling me an immense long
story about her waltzing with the Count de Schloppenzollern at the City
ball to the Allied Sovereigns and how the Count had great large white
moustaches and how odd she thought it to go whirling round the room with
a great mans arm round your waist Mr Roundhand has never allowed it
since our marriagenever but in the year fourteen it was considered a
proper compliment you know to pay the sovereigns So twentynine young
ladies of the best families in the City of London I assure you Mr
Titmarshthere was the Lord Mayors own daughters Alderman Dobbinss
gals Sir Charles Hoppers three who have the great house in Baker
Street and your humble servant who was rather slimmer in those
daystwentynine of us had a dancingmaster on purpose and practised
waltzing in a room over the Egyptian Hall at the Mansion House He was a
splendid man that Count Schloppenzollern

I am sure maam says I he had a splendid partner and blushed up
to my eyes when I said it

Get away you naughty creature says Mrs Roundhand giving me a great
slap youre all the same you men in the West Endall deceivers The
Count was just like you Heigho Before you marry its all honey and
compliments when you win us its all coldness and indifference Look
at Roundhand the great baby trying to beat down a butterfly with his
yellow bandanna Can a man like _that_ comprehend me can he fill the
void in my heart She pronounced it without the h but that there
should be no mistake laid her hand upon the place meant Ah no Will
_you_ be so neglectful when _you_ marry Mr Titmarsh

As she spoke the bells were just tolling the people out of church and I
fell athinking of my dear dear Mary Smith in the country walking home
to her grandmothers in her modest grey cloak as the bells were chiming
and the air full of the sweet smell of the hay and the river shining in
the sun all crimson purple gold and silver There was my dear Mary a
hundred and twenty miles off in Somersetshire walking home from church
along with Mr Snorters family with which she came and went and I was
listening to the talk of this great leering vulgar woman

I could not help feeling for a certain half of a sixpence that you have
heard me speak of and putting my hand mechanically upon my chest I tore
my fingers with the point of my new DIAMONDPIN Mr Polonius had sent
it home the night before and I sported it for the first time at
Roundhands to dinner

Its a beautiful diamond said Mrs Roundhand I have been looking at
it all dinnertime How rich you must be to wear such splendid things
and how can you remain in a vulgar office in the Cityyou who have such
great acquaintances at the West End

The woman had somehow put me in such a passion that I bounced off the
sofa and made for the balcony without answering a worday and half
broke my head against the sash too as I went out to the gents in the
open air Gus says I I feel very unwell I wish youd come home
with me And Gus did not desire anything better for he had ogled the
last girl out of the last church and the night was beginning to fall

What already said Mrs Roundhand there is a lobster coming upa
trifling refreshment not what hes accustomed to but

I am sorry to say I nearly said D the lobster as Roundhand went
and whispered to her that I was ill

Ay said Gus looking very knowing Recollect Mrs R that he was
_at the West End_ on Thursday asked to dine maam with the tiptop
nobs Chaps dont dine at the West End for nothing do they R If you
play at _bowls_ you know

You must look out for _rubbers_ said Roundhand as quick as thought

Not in my house of a Sunday said Mrs R looking very fierce and
angry Not a card shall be touched here Are we in a Protestant land
sir in a Christian country

My dear you dont understand We were not talking of rubbers of
whist

There shall be _no_ game at all in the house of a Sabbath eve said
Mrs Roundhand and out she flounced from the room without ever so much
as wishing us goodnight

Do stay said the husband looking very much frighteneddo stay She
wont come back while youre here and I do wish youd stay so

But we wouldnt and when we reached Salisbury Square I gave Gus a
lecture about spending his Sundays idly and read out one of Blairs
sermons before we went to bed As I turned over in bed I could not help
thinking about the luck the pin had brought me and it was not over yet
as you will see in the next chapter




CHAPTER V


HOW THE DIAMOND INTRODUCES HIM TO A STILL MORE FASHIONABLE PLACE

To tell the truth though about the pin although I mentioned it almost
the last thing in the previous chapter I assure you it was by no means
the last thing in my thoughts It had come home from Mr Poloniuss as
I said on Saturday night and Gus and I happened to be out enjoying
ourselves halfprice at Sadlers Wells and perhaps we took a little
refreshment on our way back but that has nothing to do with my story

On the table however was the little box from the jewellers and when I
took it out_my_ how the diamond did twinkle and glitter by the light
of our one candle

Im sure it would light up the room of itself says Gus Ive read
they do inin history

It was in the history of Cogia Hassan Alhabbal in the Arabian Nights
as I knew very well But we put the candle out nevertheless to try

Well I declare to goodness it does illuminate the old place says Gus
but the fact was that there was a gaslamp opposite our window and I
believe that was the reason why we could see pretty well At least in my
bedroom to which I was obliged to go without a candle and of which the
window looked out on a dead wall I could not see a wink in spite of the
Hoggarty diamond and was obliged to grope about in the dark for a
pincushion which Somebody gave me I dont mind owning it was Mary
Smith and in which I stuck it for the night But somehow I did not
sleep much for thinking of it and woke very early in the morning and
if the truth must be told stuck it in my nightgown like a fool and
admired myself very much in the glass

Gus admired it as much as I did for since my return and especially
since my venison dinner and drive with Lady Drum he thought I was the
finest fellow in the world and boasted about his West End friend
everywhere

As we were going to dine at Roundhands and I had no black satin stock
to set it off I was obliged to place it in the frill of my best shirt
which tore the muslin sadly by the way However the diamond had its
effect on my entertainers as we have seen rather too much perhaps on
one of them and next day I wore it down at the office as Gus would make
me do though it did not look near so well in the second days shirt as
on the first day when the linen was quite clear and bright with
Somersetshire washing

The chaps at the West Diddlesex all admired it hugely except that
snarling Scotchman MWhirter fourth clerkout of envy because I did
not think much of a great yellow stone named a carumgorum or some such
thing which he had in a snuffmull as he called itall except
MWhirter I say were delighted with it and Abednego himself who ought
to know as his father was in the line told me the jewel was worth at
least ten poundsh and that his governor would give me as much for it

Thats a proof says Roundhand that Tits diamond is worth at least
thirty And we all laughed and agreed it was

Now I must confess that all these praises and the respect that wag paid
me turned my head a little and as all the chaps said I _must_ have a
black satin stock to set the stone off was fool enough to buy a stock
that cost me fiveandtwenty shillings at Ludlams in Piccadilly for
Gus said I must go to the best place to be sure and have none of our
cheap and common East End stuff I might have had one for sixteen and
six in Cheapside every whit as good but when a young lad becomes vain
and wants to be fashionable you see he cant help being extravagant

Our director Mr Brough did not fail to hear of the haunch of venison
business and my relationship with Lady Drum and the Right Honourable
Edmund Preston only Abednego who told him said I was her Ladyships
first cousin and this made Brough think more of me and no worse than
before

Mr B was as everybody knows Member of Parliament for Rottenburgh and
being considered one of the richest men in the City of London used to
receive all the great people of the land at his villa at Fulham and we
often read in the papers of the rare doings going on there

Well the pin certainly worked wonders for not content merely with
making me a present of a ride in a countesss carriage of a haunch of
venison and two baskets of fruit and the dinner at Roundhands above
described my diamond had other honours in store for me and procured me
the honour of an invitation to the house of our director Mr Brough

Once a year in June that honourable gent gave a grand ball at his house
at Fulham and by the accounts of the entertainment brought back by one
or two of our chaps who had been invited it was one of the most
magnificent things to be seen about London You saw Members of
Parliament there as thick as peas in July lords and ladies without end
There was everything and everybody of the tiptop sort and I have heard
that Mr Gunter of Berkeley Square supplied the ices supper and
footmenthough of the latter Brough kept a plenty but not enough to
serve the host of people who came to him The party it must be
remembered was _Mrs_ Broughs party not the gentlemanshe being in
the Dissenting way would scarcely sanction any entertainments of the
kind but he told his City friends that his lady governed him in
everything and it was generally observed that most of them would allow
their daughters to go to the ball if asked on account of the immense
number of the nobility which our director assembled together Mrs
Roundhand I know for one would have given one of her ears to go but
as I have said before nothing would induce Brough to ask her

Roundhand himself and Gutch nineteenth clerk son of the brother of an
East Indian director were the only two of our gents invited as we knew
very well for they had received their invitations many weeks before and
bragged about them not a little But two days before the ball and after
my diamondpin had had its due effect upon the gents at the office
Abednego who had been in the directors room came to my desk with a
great smirk and said Tit Mr B says that he expects you will come
down with Roundhand to the ball on Thursday I thought Moses was
jokingat any rate that Mr Bs message was a queer one for people
dont usually send invitations in that abrupt peremptory sort of way
but sure enough he presently came down himself and confirmed it
saying as he was going out of the office Mr Titmarsh you will come
down on Thursday to Mrs Broughs party where you will see some
relations of yours

West End again says that Gus Hoskins and accordingly down I went
taking a place in a cab which Roundhand hired for himself Gutch and me
and for which he very generously paid eight shillings

There is no use to describe the grand gala nor the number of lamps in
the lodge and in the garden nor the crowd of carriages that came in at
the gates nor the troops of curious people outside nor the ices
fiddlers wreaths of flowers and cold supper within The whole
description was beautifully given in a fashionable paper by a reporter
who observed the same from the Yellow Lion over the way and told it in
his journal in the most accurate manner getting an account of the
dresses of the great people from their footmen and coachmen when they
came to the alehouse for their porter As for the names of the guests
they you may be sure found their way to the same newspaper and a great
laugh was had at my expense because among the titles of the great people
mentioned my name appeared in the list of the Honourables Next day
Brough advertised a hundred and fifty guineas reward for an emerald
necklace lost at the party of John Brough Esq at Fulham though some
of our people said that no such thing was lost at all and that Brough
only wanted to advertise the magnificence of his society but this doubt
was raised by persons not invited and envious no doubt

Well I wore my diamond as you may imagine and rigged myself in my best
clothes viz my blue coat and brass buttons before mentioned nankeen
trousers and silk stockings a white waistcoat and a pair of white
gloves bought for the occasion But my coat was of country make very
high in the waist and short in the sleeves and I suppose must have
looked rather odd to some of the great people assembled for they stared
at me a great deal and a whole crowd formed to see me dancewhich I did
to the best of my power performing all the steps accurately and with
great agility as I had been taught by our dancingmaster in the country

And with whom do you think I had the honour to dance With no less a
person than Lady Jane Preston who it appears had not gone out of town
and who shook me most kindly by the hand when she saw me and asked me to
dance with her We had my Lord Tiptoff and Lady Fanny Rakes for our vis
avis

You should have seen how the people crowded to look at us and admired my
dancing too for I cut the very best of capers quite different to the
rest of the gents my Lord among the number who walked through the
quadrille as if they thought it a trouble and stared at my activity with
all their might But when I have a dance I like to enjoy myself and
Mary Smith often said I was the very best partner at our assemblies
While we were dancing I told Lady Jane how Roundhand Gutch and I had
come down three in a cab besides the driver and my account of our
adventures made her Ladyship laugh I warrant you Lucky it was for me
that I didnt go back in the same vehicle for the driver went and
intoxicated himself at the Yellow Lion threw out Gutch and our head
clerk as he was driving them back and actually fought Gutch afterwards
and blacked his eye because he said that Gutchs red waistcoat
frightened the horse

Lady Jane however spared me such an uncomfortable ride home for she
said she had a fourth place in her carriage and asked me if I would
accept it and positively at two oclock in the morning there was I
after setting the ladies and my Lord down driven to Salisbury Square in
a great thundering carriage with flaming lamps and two tall footmen who
nearly knocked the door and the whole little street down with the noise
they made at the rapper You should have seen Guss head peeping out of
window in his white nightcap He kept me up the whole night telling him
about the ball and the great people I had seen there and next day he
told at the office my stories with his own usual embroideries upon them

Mr Titmarsh said Lady Fanny laughing to me who is that great fat
curious man the master of the house Do you know he asked me if you
were not related to us and I said Oh yes you were

Fanny says Lady Jane

Well answered the other did not Grandmamma say Mr Titmarsh was her
cousin

But you know that Grandmammas memory is not very good

Indeed youre wrong Lady Jane says my Lord I think its
prodigious

Yes but not verynot very accurate

No my Lady says I for her Ladyship the Countess of Drum said if
you remember that my friend Gus Hoskins

Whose cause you supported so bravely cries Lady Fanny

That my friend Gus is her Ladyships cousin too which cannot be for
I know all his family they live in Skinner Street and St Mary Axe and
are notnot quite so _respectable_ as _my_ relatives

At this they all began to laugh and my Lord said rather haughtily

Depend upon it Mr Titmarsh that Lady Drum is no more your cousin than
she is the cousin of your friend Mr Hoskinson

Hoskins my Lordand so I told Gus but you see he is very fond of me
and _will_ have it that I am related to Lady D and say what I will to
the contrary tells the story everywhere Though to be sure added I
with a laugh it has gained me no small good in my time So I
described to the party our dinner at Mrs Roundhands which all came
from my diamondpin and my reputation as a connection of the
aristocracy Then I thanked Lady Jane handsomely for her magnificent
present of fruit and venison and told her that it had entertained a
great number of kind friends of mine who had drunk her Ladyships health
with the greatest gratitude

_A haunch of venison_ cried Lady Jane quite astonished indeed Mr
Titmarsh I am quite at a loss to understand you

As we passed a gaslamp I saw Lady Fanny laughing as usual and turning
her great arch sparkling black eyes at Lord Tiptoff

Why Lady Jane said he if the truth must out the great haunch of
venison trick was one of this young ladys performing You must know
that I had received the abovenamed haunch from Lord Guttleburys park
and knowing that Preston is not averse to Guttlebury venison was telling
Lady Drum in whose carriage I had a seat that day as Mr Titmarsh was
not in the way that I intended the haunch for your husbands table
Whereupon my Lady Fanny clapping together her little hands declared and
vowed that the venison should not go to Preston but should be sent to a
gentleman about whose adventures on the day previous we had just been
talkingto Mr Titmarsh in fact whom Preston as Fanny vowed had used
most cruelly and to whom she said a reparation was due So my Lady
Fanny insists upon our driving straight to my rooms in the Albany you
know I am only to stay in my bachelors quarters a month longer

Nonsense says Lady Fanny

Insists upon driving straight to my chambers in the Albany extracting
thence the abovenamed haunch

Grandmamma was very sorry to part with it cries Lady Fanny

And then she orders us to proceed to Mr Titmarshs house in the City
where the venison was left in company with a couple of baskets of fruit
bought at Granges by Lady Fanny herself

And what was more said Lady Fanny I made Grandmamma go into Frinto
Lord Tiptoffs rooms and dictated out of my own mouth the letter which
he wrote and pinned up the haunch of venison that his hideous old
housekeeper brought usI am quite jealous of herI pinned up the haunch
of venison in a copy of the John Bull newspaper

It had one of the Ramsbottom letters in it I remember which Gus and I
read on Sunday at breakfast and we nearly killed ourselves with
laughing The ladies laughed too when I told them this and goodnatured
Lady Jane said she would forgive her sister and hoped I would too which
I promised to do as often as her Ladyship chose to repeat the offence

I never had any more venison from the family but Ill tell you _what_ I
had About a month after came a card of Lord and Lady Tiptoff and a
great piece of plumcake of which I am sorry to say Gus ate a great
deal too much




CHAPTER VI


OF THE WEST DIDDLESEX ASSOCIATION AND OF THE EFFECT THE DIAMOND HAD
THERE

Well the magic of the pin was not over yet Very soon after Mrs
Broughs grand party our director called me up to his room at the West
Diddlesex and after examining my accounts and speaking awhile about
business said Thats a very fine diamondpin Master Titmarsh he
spoke in a grave patronising way and I called you on purpose to speak
to you upon the subject I do not object to seeing the young men of this
establishment well and handsomely dressed but I know that their salaries
cannot afford ornaments like those and I grieve to see you with a thing
of such value You have paid for it sirI trust you have paid for it
for of all things my deardear young friend beware of debt

I could not conceive why Brough was reading me this lecture about debt
and my having bought the diamondpin as I knew that he had been asking
about it already and how I came by itAbednego told me so Why sir
says I Mr Abednego told me that he had told you that I had told him

Oh aybythebye now I recollect Mr TitmarshI do recollectyes
though I suppose sir you will imagine that I have other more important
things to remember

Oh sir in course says I

That one of the clerks _did_ say something about a pinthat one of the
other gentlemen had it And so your pin was given you was it

It was given me sir by my aunt Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty
said I raising my voice for I was a little proud of Castle Hoggarty

She must be very rich to make such presents Titmarsh

Why thank you sir says I she is pretty well off Four hundred a
year jointure a farm at Slopperton sir three houses at Squashtail and
three thousand two hundred loose cash at the bankers as I happen to
know sir_thats all_

I did happen to know this you see because while I was down in
Somersetshire Mr MacManus my aunts agent in Ireland wrote to say
that a mortgage she had on Lord Brallaghans property had just been paid
off and that the money was lodged at Couttss Ireland was in a very
disturbed state in those days and my aunt wisely determined not to
invest her money in that country any more but to look out for some good
security in England However as she had always received six per cent
in Ireland she would not hear of a smaller interest and had warned me
as I was a commercial man on coming to town to look out for some means
by which she could invest her money at that rate at least

And how do you come to know Mrs Hoggartys property so accurately
said Mr Brough upon which I told him

Good heavens sir and do you mean that you a clerk in the West
Diddlesex Insurance Office applied to by a respectable lady as to the
manner in which she should invest property never spoke to her about the
Company which you have the honour to serve Do you mean sir that you
knowing there was a bonus of five per cent for yourself upon shares
taken did not press Mrs Hoggarty to join us

Sir says I Im an honest man and would not take a bonus from my own
relation

Honest I know you are my boygive me your hand So am I honestso is
every man in this Company honest but we must be prudent as well We
have five millions of capital on our books as you seefive _bona fide_
millions of _bona fide_ sovereigns paid up sirthere is no dishonesty
there But why should we not have twenty millionsa hundred millions
Why should not this be the greatest commercial Association in the
worldas it shall be sirit shall as sure as my name is John
Brough if Heaven bless my honest endeavours to establish it But do you
suppose that it can be so unless every man among us use his utmost
exertions to forward the success of the enterprise Never sirnever
and for me I say so everywhere I glory in what I do There is not a
house in which I enter but I leave a prospectus of the West Diddlesex
There is not a single tradesman I employ but has shares in it to some
amount My servants sirmy very servants and grooms are bound up
with it And the first question I ask of anyone who applies to me for a
place is Are you insured or a shareholder in the West Diddlesex the
second Have you a good character And if the first question is answered
in the negative I say to the party coming to me Then be a shareholder
before you ask for a place in my household Did you not see meme John
Brough whose name is good for millionsstep out of my coachandfour
into this office with four pounds nineteen which I paid in to Mr
Roundhand as the price of half a share for the porter at my lodgegate
Did you remark that I deducted a shilling from the five pound

Yes sir it was the day you drew out eight hundred and seventythree
ten and sixThursday week says I

And why did I deduct that shilling sir Because it was _my
commission_John Broughs commission honestly earned by him and openly
taken Was there any disguise about it No Did I do it for the love
of a shilling No says Brough laying his hand on his heart I did it
from _principle_from that motive which guides every one of my actions
as I can look up to Heaven and say I wish all my young men to see my
example and follow it I wishI pray that they may Think of that
example sir That porter of mine has a sick wife and nine young
children he is himself a sick man and his tenure of life is feeble he
has earned money sir in my servicesixty pounds and moreit is all
his children have to look toall but for that in the event of his
death they would be houseless beggars in the street And what have I
done for that family sir I have put that money out of the reach of
Robert Gates and placed it so that it shall be a blessing to his family
at his death Every farthing is invested in shares in this office and
Robert Gates my lodgeporter is a holder of three shares in the West
Diddlesex Association and in that capacity your master and mine Do
you think I want to _cheat_ Gates

Oh sir says I

To cheat that poor helpless man and those tender innocent childrenyou
cant think so sir I should be a disgrace to human nature if I did But
what boots all my energy and perseverance What though I place my
friends money my familys money my own moneymy hopes wishes
desires ambitionsall upon this enterprise You young men will not do
so You whom I treat with love and confidence as my children make no
return to me When I toil you remain still when I struggle you look
on Say the word at onceyou doubt me O heavens that this should be
the reward of all my care and love for you

Here Mr Brough was so affected that he actually burst into tears and I
confess I saw in its true light the negligence of which I had been
guilty

Sir says I I am veryvery sorry it was a matter of delicacy
rather than otherwise which induced me not to speak to my aunt about the
West Diddlesex

Delicacy my dear dear boyas if there can be any delicacy about making
your aunts fortune Say indifference to me say ingratitude say
follybut dont say delicacyno no not delicacy Be honest my boy
and call things by their right namesalways do

It _was_ folly and ingratitude Mr Brough says I I see it all now
and Ill write to my aunt this very post

You had better do no such thing says Brough bitterly the stocks are
at ninety and Mrs Hoggarty can get three per cent for her money

I _will_ write sirupon my word and honour I will write

Well as your honour is passed you must I suppose for never break
your wordno not in a trifle Titmarsh Send me up the letter when you
have done and Ill frank itupon my word and honour I will says Mr
Brough laughing and holding out his hand to me

I took it and he pressed mine very kindlyYou may as well sit down
here says he as he kept hold of it there is plenty of paper

And so I sat down and mended a beautiful pen and began and wrote
Independent West Diddlesex Association June 1822 and My dear Aunt
in the best manner possible Then I paused a little thinking what I
should next say for I have always found that difficulty about letters
The date and My dear Soandso one writes off immediatelyit is the next
part which is hard and I put my pen in my mouth flung myself back in my
chair and began to think about it

Bah said Brough are you going to be about this letter all day my
good fellow Listen to me and Ill dictate to you in a moment So he
began

 My Dear AuntSince my return from Somersetshire I am very happy
 indeed to tell you that I have so pleased the managing director of our
 Association and the Board that they have been good enough to appoint
 me third clerk

Sir says I

Write what I say Mr Roundhand as has been agreed by the board
yesterday quits the clerks desk and takes the title of secretary and
actuary Mr Highmore takes his place Mr Abednego follows him and I
place you as third clerkas

 third clerk write with a salary of a hundred and fifty pounds per
 annum This news will I know gratify my dear mother and you who
 have been a second mother to me all my life

 When I was last at home I remember you consulted me as to the best
 mode of laying out a sum of money which was lying useless in your
 bankers hands I have since lost no opportunity of gaining what
 information I could and situated here as I am in the very midst of
 affairs I believe although very young I am as good a person to
 apply to as many others of greater age and standing

 I frequently thought of mentioning to you our Association but
 feelings of delicacy prevented me from doing so I did not wish that
 anyone should suppose that a shadow of selfinterest could move me in
 any way

 But I believe without any sort of doubt that the West Diddlesex
 Association offers the best security that you can expect for your
 capital and at the same time the highest interest you can anywhere
 procure

 The situation of the Company as I have it from _the very best
 authority_ underline that is as follows

 The subscribed and _bona fide_ capital is FIVE MILLIONS STERLING

 The body of directors you know Suffice it to say that the managing
 director is John Brough Esq of the firm of Brough and Hoff a
 Member of Parliament and a man as well known as Mr Rothschild in the
 City of London His private fortune I know for a fact amounts to
 half a million and the last dividends paid to the shareholders of the
 I W D Association amounted to 6125 per cent per annum

That I know was the dividend declared by us

 Although the shares in the market are at a very great premium it is
 the privilege of the four first clerks to dispose of a certain number
 5000_l_ each at par and if you my dearest aunt would wish for
 2500_l_ worth I hope you will allow me to oblige you by offering
 you so much of my new privileges

 Let me hear from you immediately upon the subject as I have already
 an offer for the whole amount of my shares at market price

But I havent sir says I

You have sir _I_ will take the shares but I want _you_ I want as
many respectable persons in the Company as I can bring I want you
because I like you and I dont mind telling you that I have views of my
own as well for I am an honest man and say openly what I mean and Ill
tell you _why_ I want you I cant by the regulations of the Company
have more than a certain number of votes but if your aunt takes shares
I expectI dont mind owning itthat she will vote with me _Now_ do
you understand me My object is to be all in all with the Company and
if I be I will make it the most glorious enterprise that ever was
conducted in the City of London

So I signed the letter and left it with Mr B to frank

The next day I went and took my place at the third clerks desk being
led to it by Mr B who made a speech to the gents much to the
annoyance of the other chaps who grumbled about their services though
as for the matter of that our services were very much alike the Company
was only three years old and the oldest clerk in it had not six months
more standing in it than I Look out said that envious MWhirter to
me Have you got money or have any of your relations money or are any
of them going to put it into the concern

I did not think fit to answer him but took a pinch out of his mull and
was always kind to him and he to say the truth was always most civil
to me As for Gus Hoskins he began to think I was a superior being and
I must say that the rest of the chaps behaved very kindly in the matter
and said that if one man were to be put over their heads before another
they would have pitched upon me for I had never harmed any of them and
done little kindnesses to several

I know says Abednego how you got the place It was I who got it
you I told Brough you were a cousin of Prestons the Lord of the
Treasury had venison from him and all that and depend upon it he
expects that you will be able to do him some good in that quarter

I think there was some likelihood in what Abednego said because our
governor as we called him frequently spoke to me about my cousin told
me to push the concern in the West End of the town get as many noblemen
as we could to insure with us and so on It was in vain I said I could
do nothing with Mr Preston Bah bah says Mr Brough dont tell
_me_ People dont send haunches of venison to you for nothing and Im
convinced he thought I was a very cautious prudent fellow for not
bragging about my great family and keeping my connection with them a
secret To be sure he might have learned the truth from Gus who lived
with me but Gus would insist that I was hand in glove with all the
nobility and boasted about me ten times as much as I did myself

The chaps used to call me the West Ender

See thought I what I have gained by Aunt Hoggarty giving me a
diamondpin What a lucky thing it is that she did not give me the
money as I hoped she would Had I not had the pinhad I even taken it
to any other person but Mr Polonius Lady Drum would never have noticed
me had Lady Drum never noticed me Mr Brough never would and I never
should have been third clerk of the West Diddlesex

I took heart at all this and wrote off on the very evening of my
appointment to my dearest Mary Smith giving her warning that a certain
event for which one of us was longing very earnestly might come off
sooner than we had expected And why not Miss Ss own fortune was
70_l_ a year mine was 150_l_ and when we had 300_l_ we always vowed
we would marry Ah thought I if I could but go to Somersetshire
now I might boldly walk up to old Smiths door he was her grandfather
and a halfpay lieutenant of the navy I might knock at the knocker and
see my beloved Mary in the parlour and not be obliged to sneak behind
hayricks on the lookout for her or pelt stones at midnight at her
window

My aunt in a few days wrote a pretty gracious reply to my letter She
had not determined she said as to the manner in which she should employ
her three thousand pounds but should take my offer into consideration
begging me to keep my shares open for a little while until her mind was
made up

What then does Mr Brough do I learned afterwards in the year 1830
when he and the West Diddlesex Association had disappeared altogether
how he had proceeded

Who are the attorneys at Slopperton says he to me in a careless way

Mr Ruck sir says I is the Tory solicitor and Messrs Hodge and
Smithers the Liberals I knew them very well for the fact is before
Mary Smith came to live in our parts I was rather partial to Miss Hodge
and her great goldcoloured ringlets but Mary came and soon put _her_
nose out of joint as the saying is

And you are of what politics

Why sir we are Liberals I was rather ashamed of this for Mr
Brough was an outandout Tory but Hodge and Smithers is a most
respectable firm I brought up a packet from them to Hickson Dixon
Paxton and Jackson _our_ solicitors who are their London
correspondents

Mr Brough only said Oh indeed and did not talk any further on the
subject but began admiring my diamondpin very much

Titmarsh my dear boy says he I have a young lady at Fulham who is
worth seeing I assure you and who has heard so much about you from her
father for I like you my boy I dont care to own it that she is
rather anxious to see you too Suppose you come down to us for a week
Abednego will do your work

Law sir you are very kind says I

Well you shall come down and I hope you will like my claret But hark
ye I dont think my dear fellow you are quite smart enoughquite
well enough dressed Do you understand me

Ive my blue coat and brass buttons at home sir

What that thing with the waist between your shoulders that you wore at
Mrs Broughs party It _was_ rather highwaisted being made in the
country two years before Nono that will never do Get some new
clothes sirtwo new suits of clothes

Sir says I Im already if the truth must be told very short of
money for this quarter and cant afford myself a new suit for a long
time to come

Pooh pooh dont let that annoy you Heres a tenpound notebut no
on second thoughts you may as well go to my tailors Ill drive you
down there and never mind the bill my good lad And drive me down he
actually did in his grand coachandfour to Mr Von Stiltz in Clifford
Street who took my measure and sent me home two of the finest coats
ever seen a dresscoat and a frock a velvet waistcoat a silk ditto
and three pairs of pantaloons of the most beautiful make Brough told
me to get some boots and pumps and silk stockings for evenings so that
when the time came for me to go down to Fulham I appeared as handsome as
any young nobleman and Gus said that I looked by Jingo like a regular
tiptop swell

In the meantime the following letter had been sent down to Hodge and
Smithers

 RAM ALLEY CORNHILL LONDON _July_ 1822

 DEAR SIRS

     

 This part being on private affairs relative to the cases of Dixon v
 Haggerstony Snodgrass v Rubbidge and another I am not permitted to
 extract

     

 Likewise we beg to hand you a few more prospectuses of the
 Independent West Diddlesex Fire and Life Insurance Company of which
 we have the honour to be the solicitors in London We wrote to you
 last year requesting you to accept the Slopperton and Somerset agency
 for the same and have been expecting for some time back that either
 shares or assurances should be effected by you

 The capital of the Company as you know is five millions sterling
 say 5000000_l_ and we are in a situation to offer more than the
 usual commission to our agents of the legal profession We shall be
 happy to give a premium of 6 per cent for shares to the amount of
 1000_l_ 65 per cent above a thousand to be paid immediately upon
 the taking of the shares

 I am dear Sirs for self and partners
 Yours most faithfully
 SAMUEL JACKSON

This letter as I have said came into my hands some time afterwards I
knew nothing of it in the year 1822 when in my new suit of clothes I
went down to pass a week at the Rookery Fulham residence of John
Brough Esquire MP




CHAPTER VII


HOW SAMUEL TITMARSH REACHED THE HIGHEST POINT OF PROSPERITY

If I had the pen of a George Robins I might describe the Rookery
properly suffice it however to say it is a very handsome country
place with handsome lawns sloping down to the river handsome
shrubberies and conservatories fine stables outhouses kitchengardens
and everything belonging to a firstrate _rus in urbe_ as the great
auctioneer called it when he hammered it down some years after

I arrived on a Saturday at halfanhour before dinner a grave gentleman
out of livery showed me to my room a man in a chocolate coat and gold
lace with Broughs crest on the buttons brought me a silver shavingpot
of hot water on a silver tray and a grand dinner was ready at six at
which I had the honour of appearing in Von Stiltzs dresscoat and my new
silk stockings and pumps

Brough took me by the hand as I came in and presented me to his lady a
stout fairhaired woman in light blue satin then to his daughter a
tall thin darkeyed girl with beetlebrows looking very illnatured
and about eighteen

Belinda my love said her papa this young gentleman is one of my
clerks who was at our ball

Oh indeed says Belinda tossing up her head

But not a common clerk Miss Belindaso if you please we will have
none of your aristocratic airs with him He is a nephew of the Countess
of Drum and I hope he will soon be very high in our establishment and
in the city of London

At the name of Countess I had a dozen times rectified the error about
our relationship Miss Belinda made a low curtsey and stared at me very
hard and said she would try and make the Rookery pleasant to any friend
of Papas We have not much _monde_ today continued Miss Brough
and are only in _petit comite_ but I hope before you leave us you will
see some _societe_ that will make your _sejour_ agreeable

I saw at once that she was a fashionable girl from her using the French
language in this way

Isnt she a fine girl said Brough whispering to me and evidently as
proud of her as a man could be Isnt she a fine girleh you dog Do
you see breeding like that in Somersetshire

No sir upon my word answered I rather slily for I was thinking all
the while how Somebody was a thousand times more beautiful simple and
ladylike

And what has my dearest love been doing all day said her papa

Oh Pa I have _pinced_ the harp a little to Captain Fizgigs flute
Didnt I Captain Fizgig

Captain the Honourable Francis Fizgig said Yes Brough your fair
daughter _pinced_ the harp and _touched_ the piano and _egratigned_ the
guitar and _ecorched_ a song or two and we had the pleasure of a
_promenade a leau_of a walk upon the water

Law Captain cries Mrs Brough walk on the water

Hush Mamma you dont understand French says Miss Belinda with a
sneer

Its a sad disadvantage madam says Fizgig gravely and I recommend
you and Brough here who are coming out in the great world to have some
lessons or at least get up a couple of dozen phrases and introduce them
into your conversation here and there I suppose sir you speak it
commonly at the office Mr What you call it And Mr Fizgig put his
glass into his eye and looked at me

We speak English sir says I knowing it better than French

Everybody has not had your opportunities Miss Brough continued the
gentleman Everybody has not _voyage_ like _nous autres_ hey _Mais
que voulezvous_ my good sir you must stick to your cursed ledgers and
things Whats the French for ledger Miss Belinda

How can you ask _Je nen scais rien_ Im sure

You should learn Miss Brough said her father The daughter of a
British merchant need not be ashamed of the means by which her father
gets his bread _Im_ not ashamedIm not proud Those who know John
Brough know that ten years ago he was a poor clerk like my friend
Titmarsh here and is now worth halfamillion Is there any man in the
House better listened to than John Brough Is there any duke in the land
that can give a better dinner than John Brough or a larger fortune to
his daughter than John Brough Why sir the humble person now speaking
to you could buy out many a German duke But Im not proudno no not
proud Theres my daughterlook at herwhen I die she will be
mistress of my fortune but am I proud No Let him who can win her
marry her thats what I say Be it you Mr Fizgig son of a peer of
the realm or you Bill Tidd Be it a duke or a shoeblack what do I
care heywhat do I care

Oooh sighed the gent who went by the name of Bill Tidd a very pale
young man with a black riband round his neck instead of a handkerchief
and his collars turned down like Lord Byron He was leaning against the
mantelpiece and with a pair of great green eyes ogling Miss Brough with
all his might

Oh Johnmy dear John cried Mrs Brough seizing her husbands hand
and kissing it you are an angel that you are

Isabella dont flatter me Im a _man_a plain downright citizen of
London without a particle of pride except in you and my daughter
heremy two Bells as I call them This is the way that we live
Titmarsh my boy ours is a happy humble Christian home and thats all
Isabella leave go my hand

Mamma you mustnt do so before company its odious shrieked Miss B
and Mamma quietly let the hand fall and heaved from her ample bosom a
great large sigh I felt a liking for that simple woman and a respect
for Brough too He couldnt be a bad man whose wife loved him so

Dinner was soon announced and I had the honour of leading in Miss B
who looked back rather angrily I thought at Captain Fizgig because
that gentleman had offered his arm to Mrs Brough He sat on the right
of Mrs Brough and Miss flounced down on the seat next to him leaving
me and Mr Tidd to take our places at the opposite side of the table

At dinner there was turbot and soup first and boiled turkey afterwards
of course How is it that at all the great dinners they have this
perpetual boiled turkey It was real turtlesoup the first time I had
ever tasted it and I remarked how Mrs B who insisted on helping it
gave all the green lumps of fat to her husband and put several slices of
the breast of the bird under the body until it came to his turn to be
helped

Im a plain man says John and eat a plain dinner I hate your
kickshaws though I keep a French cook for those who are not of my way of
thinking Im no egotist look you Ive no prejudices and Miss there
has her bechamels and fallals according to her taste Captain try the
_vollyvong_

We had plenty of champagne and old madeira with dinner and great silver
tankards of porter which those might take who chose Brough made
especially a boast of drinking beer and when the ladies retired said
Gentlemen Tiggins will give you an unlimited supply of wine theres no
stinting here and then laid himself down in his easychair and fell
asleep

He always does so whispered Mr Tidd to me

Get some of that yellowsealed wine Tiggins says the Captain That
other claret we had yesterday is loaded and disagrees with me
infernally

I must say I liked the yellow seal much better than Aunt Hoggartys
Rosolio

I soon found out what Mr Tidd was and what he was longing for

Isnt she a glorious creature says he to me

Who sir says I

Miss Belinda to be sure cried Tidd Did mortal ever look upon eyes
like hers or view a more sylphlike figure

She might have a little more flesh Mr Tidd says the Captain and a
little less eyebrow They look vicious those scowling eyebrows in a
girl _Quen ditesvous_ Mr Titmarsh as Miss Brough would say

I think it remarkably good claret sir says I

Egad youre the right sort of fellow says the Captain _Volto
sciolto_ eh You respect our sleeping host yonder

That I do sir as the first man in the city of London and my managing
director

And so do I says Tidd and this day fortnight when Im of age Ill
prove my confidence too

As how says I

Why sir you must know that I come intoahema considerable property
sir on the 14th of July which my father madein business

Say at once he was a tailor Tidd

He _was_ a tailor sirbut what of that Ive had a University
education and have the feelings of a gentleman as muchay perhaps
and more than some members of an effete aristocracy

Tidd dont be severe says the Captain drinking a tenth glass

Well Mr Titmarsh when of age I come into a considerable property and
Mr Brough has been so good as to say he can get me twelve hundred a year
for my twenty thousand pounds and I have promised to invest them

In the West Diddlesex sir says Iin our office

No in another company of which Mr Brough is director and quite as
good a thing Mr Brough is a very old friend of my family sir and he
has taken a great liking to me and he says that with my talents I ought
to get into Parliament and thenand then after I have laid out my
patrimony I may look to _matrimony_ you see

Oh you designing dog said the Captain When I used to lick you at
school who ever would have thought that I was thrashing a sucking
statesman

Talk away boys said Brough waking out of his sleep I only sleep
with half an eye and hear you all Yes you shall get into Parliament
Tidd my man or my names not Brough You shall have six per cent for
your money or never believe me But as for my daughterask _her_ and
not me You or the Captain or Titmarsh may have her if you can get
her All I ask in a soninlaw is that he should be as every one of
you is an honourable and highminded man

Tidd at this looked very knowing and as our host sank off to sleep
again pointed archly at his eyebrows and wagged his head at the
Captain

Bah says the Captain I say what I think and you may tell Miss
Brough if you like And so presently this conversation ended and we
were summoned in to coffee After which the Captain sang songs with Miss
Brough Tidd looked at her and said nothing I looked at prints and Mrs
Brough sat knitting stockings for the poor The Captain was sneering
openly at Miss Brough and her affected ways and talk but in spite of his
bullying contemptuous way I thought she seemed to have a great regard for
him and to bear his scorn very meekly

At twelve Captain Fizgig went off to his barracks at Knightsbridge and
Tidd and I to our rooms Next day being Sunday a great bell woke us at
eight and at nine we all assembled in the breakfastroom where Mr
Brough read prayers a chapter and made an exhortation afterwards to us
and all the members of the household except the French cook Monsieur
Nontongpaw whom I could see from my chair walking about in the
shrubberies in his white nightcap smoking a cigar

Every morning on weekdays punctually at eight Mr Brough went through
the same ceremony and had his family to prayers but though this man was
a hypocrite as I found afterwards Im not going to laugh at the family
prayers or say he was a hypocrite _because_ he had them There are many
bad and good men who dont go through the ceremony at all but I am sure
the good men would be the better for it and am not called upon to settle
the question with respect to the bad ones and therefore I have passed
over a great deal of the religious part of Mr Broughs behaviour
suffice it that religion was always on his lips that he went to church
thrice every Sunday when he had not a party and if he did not talk
religion with us when we were alone had a great deal to say upon the
subject upon occasions as I found one day when we had a Quaker and
Dissenter party to dine and when his talk was as grave as that of any
minister present Tidd was not there that dayfor nothing could make
him forsake his Byron riband or refrain from wearing his collars turned
down so Tidd was sent with the buggy to Astleys And hark ye
Titmarsh my boy said he leave your diamond pin upstairs our friends
today dont like such gewgaws and though for my part I am no enemy to
harmless ornaments yet I would not shock the feelings of those who have
sterner opinions You will see that my wife and Miss Brough consult my
wishes in this respect And so they didfor they both came down to
dinner in black gowns and tippets whereas Miss B had commonly her dress
half off her shoulders

The Captain rode over several times to see us and Miss Brough seemed
always delighted to see _him_ One day I met him as I was walking out
alone by the river and we had a long talk together

Mr Titmarsh says he from what little I have seen of you you seem
to be an honest straightminded young fellow and I want some information
that you can give Tell me in the first place if you willand upon my
honour it shall go no fartherabout this Insurance Company of yours You
are in the City and see how affairs are going on Is your concern a
stable one

Sir said I frankly then and upon my honour too I believe it is It
has been set up only four years it is true but Mr Brough had a great
name when it was established and a vast connection Every clerk in the
office has to be sure in a manner paid for his place either by taking
shares himself or by his relations taking them I got mine because my
mother who is very poor devoted a small sum of money that came to us to
the purchase of an annuity for herself and a provision for me The
matter was debated by the family and our attorneys Messrs Hodge and
Smithers who are very well known in our part of the country and it was
agreed on all hands that my mother could not do better with her money for
all of us than invest it in this way Brough alone is worth half a
million of money and his name is a host in itself Nay more I wrote
the other day to an aunt of mine who has a considerable sum of money in
loose cash and who had consulted me as to the disposal of it to invest
it in our office Can I give you any better proof of my opinion of its
solvency

Did Brough persuade you in any way

Yes he certainly spoke to me but he very honestly told me his motives
and tells them to us all as honestly He says Gentlemen it is my
object to increase the connection of the office as much as possible I
want to crush all the other offices in London Our terms are lower than
any office and we can bear to have them lower and a great business will
come to us that way But we must work ourselves as well Every single
shareholder and officer of the establishment must exert himself and
bring us customersno matter for how little they are engagedengage
them that is the great point And accordingly our Director makes all
his friends and servants shareholders his very lodgeporter yonder is a
shareholder and he thus endeavours to fasten upon all whom he comes
near I for instance have just been appointed over the heads of our
gents to a much better place than I held I am asked down here and
entertained royally and why Because my aunt has three thousand pounds
which Mr Brough wants her to invest with us

That looks awkward Mr Titmarsh

Not a whit sir he makes no disguise of the matter When the question
is settled one way or the other I dont believe Mr Brough will take any
further notice of me But he wants me now This place happened to fall
in just at the very moment when he had need of me and he hopes to gain
over my family through me He told me as much as we drove down You
are a man of the world Titmarsh said he you know that I dont give
you this place because you are an honest fellow and write a good hand
If I had a lesser bribe to offer you at the moment I should only have
given you that but I had no choice and gave you what was in my power

Thats fair enough but what can make Brough so eager for such a small
sum as three thousand pounds

If it had been ten sir he would have been not a bit more eager You
dont know the city of London and the passion which our great men in the
sharemarket have for increasing their connection Mr Brough sir
would canvass and wheedle a chimneysweep in the way of business See
here is poor Tidd and his twenty thousand pounds Our Director has taken
possession of him just in the same way He wants all the capital he can
lay his hands on

Yes and suppose he runs off with the capital

Mr Brough of the firm of Brough and Hoff sir Suppose the Bank of
England runs off But here we are at the lodgegate Lets ask Gates
another of Mr Broughs victims And we went in and spoke to old Gates

Well Mr Gates says I beginning the matter cleverly you are one of
my masters you know at the West Diddlesex yonder

Yees sure says old Gates grinning He was a retired servant with a
large family come to him in his old age

May I ask you what your wages are Mr Gates that you can lay by so
much money and purchase shares in our Company

Gates told us his wages and when we inquired whether they were paid
regularly swore that his master was the kindest gentleman in the world
that he had put two of his daughters into service two of his sons to
charity schools made one apprentice and narrated a hundred other
benefits that he had received from the family Mrs Brough clothed half
the children master gave them blankets and coats in winter and soup and
meat all the year round There never was such a generous family sure
since the world began

Well sir said I to the Captain does that satisfy you Mr Brough
gives to these people fifty times as much as he gains from them and yet
he makes Mr Gates take shares in our Company

Mr Titmarsh says the Captain you are an honest fellow and I
confess your argument sounds well Now tell me do you know anything
about Miss Brough and her fortune

Brough will leave her everythingor says so But I suppose the
Captain saw some particular expression in my countenance for he laughed
and said

I suppose my dear fellow you think shes dear at the price Well I
dont know that you are far wrong

Why then if I may make so bold Captain Fizgig are you always at her
heels

Mr Titmarsh says the Captain I owe twenty thousand pounds and he
went back to the house directly and proposed for her

I thought this rather cruel and unprincipled conduct on the gentlemans
part for he had been introduced to the family by Mr Tidd with whom he
had been at school and had supplanted Tidd entirely in the great
heiresss affections Brough stormed and actually swore at his daughter
as the Captain told me afterwards when he heard that the latter had
accepted Mr Fizgig and at last seeing the Captain made him give his
word that the engagement should be kept secret for a few months And
Captain F only made a confidant of me and the mess as he said but
this was after Tidd had paid his twenty thousand pounds over to our
governor which he did punctually when he came of age The same day
too he proposed for the young lady and I need not say was rejected
Presently the Captains engagement began to be whispered about all his
great relations the Duke of Doncaster the Earl of Cinqbars the Earl of
Crabs c came and visited the Brough family the Hon Henry Ringwood
became a shareholder in our Company and the Earl of Crabs offered to be
Our shares rose to a premium our Director his lady and daughter were
presented at Court and the great West Diddlesex Association bid fair to
be the first Assurance Office in the kingdom

A very short time after my visit to Fulham my dear aunt wrote to me to
say that she had consulted with her attorneys Messrs Hodge and
Smithers who strongly recommended that she should invest the sum as I
advised She had the sum invested too in my name paying me many
compliments upon my honesty and talent of which she said Mr Brough
had given her the most flattering account And at the same time my aunt
informed me that at her death the shares should be my own This gave me
a great weight in the Company as you may imagine At our next annual
meeting I attended in my capacity as a shareholder and had great
pleasure in hearing Mr Brough in a magnificent speech declare a
dividend of six per cent that we all received over the counter

You lucky young scoundrel said Brough to me do you know what made me
give you your place

Why my aunts money to be sure sir said I

No such thing Do you fancy I cared for those paltry three thousand
pounds I was told you were nephew of Lady Drum and Lady Drum is
grandmother of Lady Jane Preston and Mr Preston is a man who can do us
a world of good I knew that they had sent you venison and the deuce
knows what and when I saw Lady Jane at my party shake you by the hand
and speak to you so kindly I took all Abednegos tales for gospel
_That_ was the reason you got the place mark you and not on account of
your miserable three thousand pounds Well sir a fortnight after you
were with us at Fulham I met Preston in the House and made a merit of
having given the place to his cousin Confound the insolent scoundrel
said he _he_ my cousin I suppose you take all old Drums stories for
true Why man its her mania she never is introduced to a man but she
finds out a cousinship and would not fail of course with that cur of a
Titmarsh Well said I laughing that cur has got a good place in
consequence and the matter cant be mended So you see continued our
Director that you were indebted for your place not to your aunts
money but

But to MY AUNTS DIAMOND PIN

Lucky rascal said Brough poking me in the side and going out of the
way And lucky in faith I thought I was




CHAPTER VIII


RELATES THE HAPPIEST DAY OF SAMUEL TITMARSHS LIFE

I dont know how it was that in the course of the next six months Mr
Roundhand the actuary who had been such a profound admirer of Mr
Brough and the West Diddlesex Association suddenly quarrelled with both
and taking his money out of the concern he disposed of his 5000_l_
worth of shares to a pretty good profit and went away speaking
everything that was evil both of the Company and the Director

Mr Highmore now became secretary and actuary Mr Abednego was first
clerk and your humble servant was second in the office at a salary of
250_l_ a year How unfounded were Mr Roundhands aspersions of the
West Diddlesex appeared quite clearly at our meeting in January 1823
when our Chief Director in one of the most brilliant speeches ever
heard declared that the halfyearly dividend was 4_l_ per cent at the
rate of 8_l_ per cent per annum and I sent to my aunt 120_l_ sterling
as the amount of the interest of the stock in my name

My excellent aunt Mrs Hoggarty delighted beyond measure sent me back
10_l_ for my own pocket and asked me if she had not better sell
Slopperton and Squashtail and invest all her money in this admirable
concern

On this point I could not surely do better than ask the opinion of Mr
Brough Mr B told me that shares could not be had but at a premium
but on my representing that I knew of 5000_l_ worth in the market at
par he saidWell if so he would like a fair price for his and would
not mind disposing of 5000_l_ worth as he had rather a glut of West
Diddlesex shares and his other concerns wanted feeding with ready
money At the end of our conversation of which I promised to report
the purport to Mrs Hoggarty the Director was so kind as to say that he
had determined on creating a place of private secretary to the Managing
Director and that I should hold that office with an additional salary of
150_l_

I had 250_l_ a year Miss Smith had 70_l_ per annum to her fortune
What had I said should be my line of conduct whenever I could realise
300_l_ a year

Gus of course and all the gents in our office through him knew of my
engagement with Mary Smith Her father had been a commander in the navy
and a very distinguished officer and though Mary as I have said only
brought me a fortune of 70_l_ a year and I as everybody said in my
present position in the office and the City of London might have
reasonably looked out for a lady with much more money yet my friends
agreed that the connection was very respectable and I was content as
who would not have been with such a darling as Mary I am sure for my
part I would not have taken the Lord Mayors own daughter in place of
Mary even with a plum to her fortune

Mr Brough of course was made aware of my approaching marriage as of
everything else relating to every clerk in the office and I do believe
Abednego told him what we had for dinner every day Indeed his
knowledge of our affairs was wonderful

He asked me how Marys money was invested It was in the three per cent
consols2333_l_ 6_s_ 8_d_

Remember says he my lad Mrs Sam Titmarsh that is to be may have
seven per cent for her money at the very least and on better security
than the Bank of England for is not a Company of which John Brough is
the head better than any other company in England and to be sure I
thought he was not far wrong and promised to speak to Marys guardians
on the subject before our marriage Lieutenant Smith her grandfather
had been at the first very much averse to our union I must confess
that one day finding me alone with her and kissing I believe the tips
of her little fingers he had taken me by the collar and turned me out of
doors But Sam Titmarsh with a salary of 250_l_ a year a promised
fortune of 150_l_ more and the righthand man of Mr John Brough of
London was a very different man from Sam the poor clerk and the poor
clergymans widows son and the old gentleman wrote me a kind letter
enough and begged me to get him six pairs of lambswool stockings and
four ditto waistcoats from Romanis and accepted them too as a present
from me when I went down in Junein happy June of 1823to fetch my dear
Mary away

Mr Brough was likewise kindly anxious about my aunts Slopperton and
Squashtail property which she had not as yet sold as she talked of
doing and as Mr B represented it was a sin and a shame that any
person in whom he took such interest as he did in all the relatives of
his dear young friend should only have three per cent for her money
when she could have eight elsewhere He always called me Sam now
praised me to the other young men who brought the praises regularly to
me said there was a cover always laid for me at Fulham and repeatedly
took me thither There was but little company when I went and MWhirter
used to say he only asked me on days when he had his vulgar
acquaintances But I did not care for the great people not being born
in their sphere and indeed did not much care for going to the house at
all Miss Belinda was not at all to my liking After her engagement
with Captain Fizgig and after Mr Tidd had paid his 20000_l_ and
Fizgigs great relations had joined in some of our Directors companies
Mr Brough declared he believed that Captain Fizgigs views were
mercenary and put him to the proof at once by saying that he must take
Miss Brough without a farthing or not have her at all Whereupon
Captain Fizgig got an appointment in the colonies and Miss Brough became
more illhumoured than ever But I could not help thinking she was rid
of a bad bargain and pitying poor Tidd who came back to the charge
again more lovesick than ever and was rebuffed pitilessly by Miss
Belinda Her father plainly told Tidd too that his visits were
disagreeable to Belinda and though he must always love and value him he
begged him to discontinue his calls at the Rookery Poor fellow he had
paid his 20000_l_ away for nothing for what was six per cent to him
compared to six per cent and the hand of Miss Belinda Brough

Well Mr Brough pitied the poor lovesick swain as he called me so
much and felt such a warm sympathy in my wellbeing that he insisted on
my going down to Somersetshire with a couple of months leave and away I
went as happy as a lark with a couple of brandnew suits from Von
Stiltzs in my trunk I had them made looking forward to a certain
event and inside the trunk Lieutenant Smiths fleecy hosiery wrapping
up a parcel of our prospectuses and two letters from John Brough Esq
to my mother our worthy annuitant and to Mrs Hoggarty our excellent
shareholder Mr Brough said I was all that the fondest father could
wish that he considered me as his own boy and that he earnestly begged
Mrs Hoggarty not to delay the sale of her little landed property as
land was high now and _must fall_ whereas the West Diddlesex Association
shares were comparatively low and must inevitably in the course of a
year or two double treble quadruple their present value

In this way I was prepared and in this way I took leave of my dear Gus
As we parted in the yard of the BoltinTun Fleet Street I felt that
I never should go back to Salisbury Square again and had made my little
present to the landladys family accordingly She said I was the
respectablest gentleman she had ever had in her house nor was that
saying much for Bell Lane is in the Rules of the Fleet and her lodgers
used commonly to be prisoners on Rule from that place As for Gus the
poor fellow cried and blubbered so that he could not eat a morsel of the
muffins and grilled ham with which I treated him for breakfast in the
BoltinTun coffeehouse and when I went away was waving his hat and
his handkerchief so in the archway of the coachoffice that I do believe
the wheels of the True Blue went over his toes for I heard him roaring
as we passed through the arch Ah how different were my feelings as I
sat proudly there on the box by the side of Jim Ward the coachman to
those I had the last time I mounted that coach parting from my dear Mary
and coming to London with my DIAMOND PIN

When arrived near home at Grumpley three miles from our village where
the True Blue generally stops to take a glass of ale at the Poppleton
Arms it was as if our Member Mr Poppleton himself was come into the
country so great was the concourse of people assembled round the inn
And there was the landlord of the inn and all the people of the village
Then there was Tom Wheeler the postboy from Mrs Rincers
postinghotel in our town he was riding on the old bay posters and
they Heaven bless us were drawing my aunts yellow chariot in which
she never went out but thrice in a year and in which she now sat in her
splendid cashmere shawl and a new hat and feather She waved a white
handkerchief out of the window and Tom Wheeler shouted out Huzza as
did a number of the little blackguard boys of Grumpley who to be sure
would huzza for anything What a change on Tom Wheelers part however
I remembered only a few years before how he had whipped me from the box
of the chaise as I was hanging on for a ride behind

Next to my aunts carriage came the fourwheeled chaise of Lieutenant
Smith RN who was driving his old fat pony with his lady by his side
I looked in the back seat of the chaise and felt a little sad at seeing
that _Somebody_ was not there But O silly fellow there was Somebody
in the yellow chariot with my aunt blushing like a peony I declare and
looking so happyoh so happy and pretty She had a white dress and a
light blue and yellow scarf which my aunt said were the Hoggarty
colours though what the Hoggartys had to do with light blue and yellow
I dont know to this day

Well the True Blue guard made a great bellowing on his horn as his
four horses dashed away the boys shouted again I was placed bodkin
between Mrs Hoggarty and Mary Tom Wheeler cut into his bays the
Lieutenant who had shaken me cordially by the hand and whose big dog
did not make the slightest attempt at biting me this time beat his pony
till its fat sides lathered again and thus in this I may say
unexampled procession I arrived in triumph at our village

My dear mother and the girlsHeaven bless themnine of them in their
nankeen spencers I had something pretty in my trunk for each of
themcould not afford a carriage but had posted themselves on the road
near the village and there was such a waving of hands and handkerchiefs
and though my aunt did not much notice them except by a majestic toss of
the head which is pardonable in a woman of her property yet Mary Smith
did even more than I and waved her hands as much as the whole nine Ah
how my dear mother cried and blessed me when we met and called me her
souls comfort and her darling boy and looked at me as if I were a
paragon of virtue and genius whereas I was only a very lucky young
fellow that by the aid of kind friends had stepped rapidly into a very
pretty property

I was not to stay with my motherthat had been arranged beforehand for
though she and Mrs Hoggarty were not remarkably good friends yet Mother
said it was for my benefit that I should stay with my aunt and so give
up the pleasure of having me with her and though hers was much the
humbler house of the two I need not say I preferred it far to Mrs
Hoggartys more splendid one let alone the horrible Rosolio of which I
was obliged now to drink gallons

It was to Mrs Hs then we were driven she had prepared a great dinner
that evening and hired an extra waiter and on getting out of the
carriage she gave a sixpence to Tom Wheeler saying that was for
himself and that she would settle with Mrs Rincer for the horses
afterwards At which Tom flung the sixpence upon the ground swore most
violently and was very justly called by my aunt an impertinent fellow

She had taken such a liking to me that she would hardly bear me out of
her sight We used to sit for morning after morning over her accounts
debating for hours together the propriety of selling the Slopperton
property but no arrangement was come to yet about it for Hodge and
Smithers could not get the price she wanted And moreover she vowed
that at her decease she would leave every shilling to me

Hodge and Smithers too gave a grand party and treated me with marked
consideration as did every single person of the village Those who
could not afford to give dinners gave teas and all drank the health of
the young couple and many a time after dinner or supper was my Mary made
to blush by the allusions to the change in her condition

The happy day for that ceremony was now fixed and the 24th July 1823
saw me the happiest husband of the prettiest girl in Somersetshire We
were married from my mothers house who would insist upon that at any
rate and the nine girls acted as bridesmaids ay and Gus Hoskins came
from town express to be my groomsman and had my old room at my mothers
and stayed with her for a week and cast a sheepseye upon Miss Winny
Titmarsh too my dear fourth sister as I afterwards learned

My aunt was very kind upon the marriage ceremony indeed She had
desired me some weeks previous to order three magnificent dresses for
Mary from the celebrated Madame Mantalini of London and some elegant
trinkets and embroidered pockethandkerchiefs from Howell and Jamess
These were sent down to me and were to be _my_ present to the bride but
Mrs Hoggarty gave me to understand that I need never trouble myself
about the payment of the bill and I thought her conduct very generous
Also she lent us her chariot for the wedding journey and made with her
own hands a beautiful crimson satin reticule for Mrs Samuel Titmarsh
her dear niece It contained a huswife completely furnished with
needles c for she hoped Mrs Titmarsh would never neglect her needle
and a purse containing some silver pennies and a very curious pocket
piece As long as you keep these my dear said Mrs Hoggarty you
will never want and ferventlyfervently do I pray that you will keep
them In the carriagepocket we found a paper of biscuits and a bottle
of Rosolio We laughed at this and made it over to Tom Wheelerwho
however did not seem to like it much better than we

I need not say I was married in Mr Von Stiltzs coat the third and
fourth coats Heaven help us in a year and that I wore sparkling in my
bosom the GREAT HOGGARTY DIAMOND




CHAPTER IX


BRINGS BACK SAM HIS WIFE AUNT AND DIAMOND TO LONDON

We pleased ourselves during the honeymoon with forming plans for our life
in London and a pretty paradise did we build for ourselves Well we
were but forty years old between us and for my part I never found any
harm come of castlebuilding but a great deal of pleasure

Before I left London I had to say the truth looked round me for a
proper place befitting persons of our small income and Gus Hoskins and
I who hunted after officehours in couples bad fixed on a very snug
little cottage in Camden Town where there was a garden that certain
_small people_ might play in when they came a horse and gighouse if
ever we kept oneand why not in a few yearsand a fine healthy air
at a reasonable distance from Change all for 30_l_ a year I had
described this little spot to Mary as enthusiastically as Sancho
describes Lizias to Don Quixote and my dear wife was delighted with the
prospect of housekeeping there vowed she would cook all the best dishes
herself especially jampudding of which I confess I am very fond and
promised Gus that he should dine with us at Clematis Bower every Sunday
only he must not smoke those horrid cigars As for Gus he vowed he
would have a room in the neighbourhood too for he could not bear to go
back to Bell Lane where we two had been so happy together and so good
natured Mary said she would ask my sister Winny to come and keep her
company At which Hoskins blushed and said Pooh nonsense now

But all our hopes of a happy snug Clematis Lodge were dashed to the
ground on our return from our little honeymoon excursion when Mrs
Hoggarty informed us that she was sick of the country and was determined
to go to London with her dear nephew and niece and keep house for them
and introduce them to her friends in the metropolis

What could we do We wished her atBath certainly not in London But
there was no help for it and we were obliged to bring her for as my
mother said if we offended her her fortune would go out of our family
and were we two young people not likely to want it

So we came to town rather dismally in the carriage posting the whole
way for the carriage must be brought and a person of my aunts rank in
life could not travel by the stage And I had to pay 14_l_ for the
posters which pretty nearly exhausted all my little hoard of cash

First we went into lodgingsinto three sets in three weeks We
quarrelled with the first landlady because my aunt vowed that she cut a
slice off the leg of mutton which was served for our dinner from the
second lodgings we went because aunt vowed the maid would steal the
candles from the third we went because Aunt Hoggarty came down to
breakfast the morning after our arrival with her face shockingly swelled
and bitten bynever mind what To cut a long tale short I was half mad
with the continual choppings and changings and the long stories and
scoldings of my aunt As for her great acquaintances none of them were
in London and she made it a matter of quarrel with me that I had not
introduced her to John Brough Esquire MP and to Lord and Lady
Tiptoff her relatives

Mr Brough was at Brighton when we arrived in town and on his return I
did not care at first to tell our Director that I had brought my aunt
with me or mention my embarrassments for money He looked rather
serious when perforce I spoke of the latter to him and asked for an
advance but when he heard that my lack of money had been occasioned by
the bringing of my aunt to London his tone instantly changed That my
dear boy alters the question Mrs Hoggarty is of an age when all things
must be yielded to her Here are a hundred pounds and I beg you to draw
upon me whenever you are in the least in want of money This gave me
breathingtime until she should pay her share of the household expenses
And the very next day Mr and Mrs John Brough in their splendid
carriageandfour called upon Mrs Hoggarty and my wife at our lodgings
in Lambs Conduit Street

It was on the very day when my poor aunt appeared with her face in that
sad condition and she did not fail to inform Mrs Brough of the cause
and to state that at Castle Hoggarty or at her country place in
Somersetshire she had never heard or thought of such vile odious things

Gracious heavens shouted John Brough Esquire a lady of your rank to
suffer in this waythe excellent relative of my dear boy Titmarsh
Never madamnever let it be said that Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty
should be subject to such horrible humiliation while John Brough has a
home to offer hera humble happy Christian home madam though
unlike perhaps the splendour to which you have been accustomed in the
course of your distinguished career Isabella my loveBelinda speak
to Mrs Hoggarty Tell her that John Broughs house is hers from garret
to cellar I repeat it madam from garret to cellar I desireI
insistI order that Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggartys trunks should be
placed this instant in my carriage Have the goodness to look to them
yourself Mrs Titmarsh and see that your dear aunts comforts are
better provided for than they have been

Mary went away rather wondering at this order But to be sure Mr
Brough was a great man and her Samuels benefactor and though the silly
child absolutely began to cry as she packed and toiled at Aunts enormous
valises yet she performed the work and came down with a smiling face to
my aunt who was entertaining Mr and Mrs Brough with a long and
particular account of the balls at the Castle in Dublin in Lord
Charlevilles time

I have packed the trunks Aunt but I am not strong enough to bring them
down said Mary

Certainly not certainly not said John Brough perhaps a little
ashamed Hallo George Frederic Augustus come upstairs this
instant and bring down the trunks of Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty
which this young lady will show you

Nay so great was Mr Broughs condescension that when some of his
fashionable servants refused to meddle with the trunks he himself seized
a pair of them with both bands carried them to the carriage and shouted
loud enough for all Lambs Conduit Street to hear John Brough is not
proudno no and if his footmen are too high and mighty hell show
them a lesson of humility

Mrs Brough was for running downstairs too and taking the trunks from
her husband but they were too heavy for her so she contented herself
with sitting on one and asking all persons who passed her whether John
Brough was not an angel of a man

In this way it was that my aunt left us I was not aware of her
departure for I was at the office at the time and strolling back at
five with Gus saw my dear Mary smiling and bobbing from the window and
beckoning to us both to come up This I thought was very strange
because Mrs Hoggarty could not abide Hoskins and indeed had told me
repeatedly that either she or he must quit the house Well we went
upstairs and there was Mary who had dried her tears and received us
with the most smiling of faces and laughed and clapped her hands and
danced and shook Guss hand And what do you think the little rogue
proposed I am blest if she did not say she would like to go to
Vauxhall

As dinner was laid for three persons only Gus took his seat with fear
and trembling and then Mrs Sam Titmarsh related the circumstances which
had occurred and how Mrs Hoggarty had been whisked away to Fulham in
Mr Broughs splendid carriageandfour Let her go I am sorry to
say said I and indeed we relished our vealcutlets and jampudding a
great deal more than Mrs Hoggarty did her dinner off plate at the
Rookery

We had a very merry party to Vauxhall Gus insisting on standing treat
and you may be certain that my aunt whose absence was prolonged for
three weeks was heartily welcome to remain away for we were much
merrier and more comfortable without her My little Mary used to make my
breakfast before I went to office of mornings and on Sundays we had a
holiday and saw the dear little children eat their boiled beef and
potatoes at the Foundling and heard the beautiful music but beautiful
as it is I think the children were a more beautiful sight still and the
look of their innocent happy faces was better than the best sermon On
weekdays Mrs Titmarsh would take a walk about five oclock in the
evening on the _left_hand side of Lambs Conduit Street as you go to
Holbornay and sometimes pursue her walk as far as Snow Hill when two
young gents from the I W D Fire and Life were pretty sure to meet her
and then how happily we all trudged off to dinner Once we came up as a
monster of a man with high heels and a goldheaded cane and whiskers
all over his face was grinning under Marys bonnet and chattering to
her close to Day and Martins Blacking Manufactory not near such a
handsome thing then as it is nowthere was the man chattering and
ogling his best when who should come up but Gus and I And in the
twinkling of a pegpost as Lord Duberley says my gentleman was seized by
the collar of his coat and found himself sprawling under a stand of
hackneycoaches where all the watermen were grinning at him The best
of it was he left his _head of hair and whiskers_ in my hand but Mary
said Dont be hard upon him Samuel its only a Frenchman And so we
gave him his wig back which one of the grinning stableboys put on and
carried to him as he lay in the straw

He shrieked out something about arretez and Francais and champ
dhonneur but we walked on Gus putting his thumb to his nose and
stretching out his finger at Master Frenchman This made everybody
laugh and so the adventure ended

About ten days after my aunts departure came a letter from her of which
I give a copy

 My Dear NephewIt was my earnest whish eer this to have returned
 to London where I am sure you and my niece Titmarsh miss me very
 much and where she poor thing quite inexperienced in the ways of
 the great metropulus in aconamy and indeed in every qualaty
 requasit in a good wife and the mistress of a famaly can hardly
 manidge I am sure without me

 Tell her _on no account_ to pay more than 65_d_ for the prime
 pieces 475_d_ for soup meat and that the very best of London
 butter is to be had for 85_d_ of course for pudns and the kitchin
 youll employ a commoner sort My trunks were sadly packed by Mrs
 Titmarsh and the hasp of the portmantyoulock has gone through my
 yellow satn I have darned it and woar it already twice at two
 ellygant though quiat eveningparties given by my _hospatable_ host
 and my pegreen velvet on Saturday at a grand dinner when Lord
 Scaramouch handed me to table Everything was in the most _sumptious
 style_ Soup top and bottom white and brown removed by turbit and
 sammon with _immense boles of lobstersauce_ Lobsters alone cost
 15_s_ Turbit three guineas The hole sammon weighing Im sure
 15 lbs and _never seen_ at table again not a bitt of pickled sammon
 the hole weak afterwards This kind of extravigance would _just suit_
 Mrs Sam Titmarsh who as I always say burns _the candle at both
 ends_ Well young people it is lucky for you you have an old aunt
 who knows better and has a long purse without witch I dare say
 _some_ folks would be glad to see her out of doors I dont mean you
 Samuel who have I must say been a dutiful nephew to me Well I
 dare say I shant live long and some folks wont be sorry to have me
 in my grave

 Indeed on Sunday I was taken in my stomick very ill and thought it
 might have been the lobstersauce but Doctor Blogg who was called
 in said it was he very much feared _cumsumptive_ but gave me some
 pills and a draft wh made me better Please call upon himhe lives
 at Pimlico and you can walk out there after office hoursand present
 him with 1_l_ 1_s_ with my compliments I have no money here but a
 10_l_ note the rest being locked up in my box at Lambs Cundit
 Street

 Although the flesh is not neglected in Mr Bs sumptious
 establishment I can assure you the _sperrit_ is likewise cared for
 Mr B reads and igspounds every morning and o but his exorcises
 refresh the hungry sole before breakfast Everything is in the
 handsomest stylesilver and goold plate at breakfast lunch and
 dinner and his crest and motty a beehive with the Latn word
 _Industria_ meaning industry on _everything_even on the chany
 juggs and things in my beddroom On Sunday we were favoured by a
 special outpouring from the Rev Grimes Wapshot of the Amabaptist
 Congrigation here and who egshorted for 3 hours in the afternoon in
 Mr Bs private chapel As the widow of a Hoggarty I have always
 been a staunch supporter of the established Church of England and
 Ireland but I must say Mr Wapshots stirring way was far superior to
 that of the Rev Bland Blenkinsop of the Establishment who lifted up
 his voice after dinner for a short discourse of two hours

 Mrs Brough is between ourselves a poor creature and has no
 sperrit of her own As for Miss B she is so saucy that once I
 promised to box her years and would have left the house had not Mr
 B taken my part and Miss made me a suitable apollogy

 I dont know when I shall return to town being made really so
 welcome here Dr Blogg says the air of Fulham is the best in the
 world for my simtums and as the ladies of the house do not choose to
 walk out with me the Rev Grimes Wapshot has often been kind enough
 to lend me his arm and tis sweet with such a guide to wander both to
 Putney and Wandsworth and igsamin the wonderful works of nature I
 have spoke to him about the Slopperton property and he is not of Mr
 Bs opinion that I should sell it but on this point I shall follow
 my own counsel

 Meantime you must gett into more comfortable lodgings and lett my
 bedd be warmed every night and of rainy days have a fire in the
 grate and let Mrs Titmarsh look up my blue silk dress and turn it
 against I come and there is my purple spencer she can have for
 herself and I hope she does not wear those three splendid gowns you
 gave her but keep them until _better times_ I shall soon introduse
 her to my friend Mr Brough and others of my acquaintances and am
 always

 Your loving AUNT

 I have ordered a chest of the Rosolio to be sent from Somersetshire
 When it comes please to send half down here paying the carriage of
 course Twill be an acceptable present to my kind entertainer Mr
 B

This letter was brought to me by Mr Brough himself at the office who
apologised to me for having broken the seal by inadvertence for the
letter had been mingled with some more of his own and he opened it
without looking at the superscription Of course he had not read it and
I was glad of that for I should not have liked him to see my aunts
opinion of his daughter and lady

The next day a gentleman at Toms Coffeehouse Cornhill sent me word
at the office that he wanted particularly to speak to me and I stopped
thither and found my old friend Smithers of the house of Hodge and
Smithers just off the coach with his carpetbag between his legs

Sam my boy said he you are your aunts heir and I have a piece of
news for you regarding her property which you ought to know She wrote
us down a letter for a chest of that homemade wine of hers which she
calls Rosolio and which lies in our warehouse along with her furniture

Well says I smiling she may part with as much Rosolio as she likes
for me I cede all my right

Psha says Smithers its not that though her furniture puts us to a
deuced inconvenience to be sureits not that but in the postscript
of her letter she orders us to advertise the Slopperton and Squashtail
estates for immediate sale as she purposes placing her capital
elsewhere

I know that the Slopperton and Squashtail property had been the source of
a very pretty income to Messrs Hodge and Smithers for Aunt was always
at law with her tenants and paid dearly for her litigious spirit so
that Mr Smitherss concern regarding the sale of it did not seem to me
to be quite disinterested

And did you come to London Mr Smithers expressly to acquaint me with
this fact It seems to me you had much better have obeyed my aunts
instructions at once or go to her at Fulham and consult with her on
this subject

Sdeath Mr Titmarsh dont you see that if she makes a sale of her
property she will hand over the money to Brough and if Brough gets the
money he

Will give her seven per cent for it instead of threetheres no harm
in that

But theres such a thing as security look you He is a warm man
certainlyvery warmquite respectablemost undoubtedly respectable
But who knows A panic may take place and then these five hundred
companies in which he is engaged may bring him to ruin Theres the
Ginger Beer Company of which Brough is a director awkward reports are
abroad concerning it The Consolidated Baffins Bay Muff and Tippet
Companythe shares are down very low and Brough is a director there
The Patent Pump Companyshares at 65 and a fresh call which nobody
will pay

Nonsense Mr Smithers Has not Mr Brough five hundred thousand
pounds worth of shares in the INDEPENDENT WEST DIDDLESEX and is THAT at
a discount Who recommended my aunt to invest her money in that
speculation I should like to know I had him there

Well well it is a very good speculation certainly and has brought
you three hundred a year Sam my boy and you may thank us for the
interest we took in you indeed we loved you as a son and Miss Hodge
has not recovered a certain marriage yet You dont intend to rebuke us
for making your fortune do you

No hang it no says I and shook hands with him and accepted a glass
of sherry and biscuits which he ordered forthwith

Smithers returned however to the charge Sam he said mark my
words and take your aunt _away from the Rookery_ She wrote to Mrs S
a long account of a reverend gent with whom she walks out therethe
Reverend Grimes Wapshot That man has an eye upon her He was tried at
Lancaster in the year 14 for forgery and narrowly escaped with his
neck Have a care of himhe has an eye to her money

Nay said I taking out Mrs Hoggartys letter read for yourself

He read it over very carefully seemed to be amused by it and as he
returned it to me Well Sam he said I have only two favours to ask
of you one is not to mention that I am in town to any living soul and
the other is to give me a dinner in Lambs Conduit Street with your
pretty wife

I promise you both gladly I said laughing But if you dine with us
your arrival in town must be known for my friend Gus Hoskins dines with
us likewise and has done so nearly every day since my aunt went

He laughed too and said We must swear Gus to secrecy over a bottle
And so we parted till dinnertime

The indefatigable lawyer pursued his attack after dinner and was
supported by Gus and by my wife too who certainly was disinterested in
the mattermore than disinterested for she would have given a great
deal to be spared my aunts company But she said she saw the force of
Mr Smitherss arguments and I admitted their justice with a sigh
However I rode my high horse and vowed that my aunt should do what she
liked with her money and that I was not the man who would influence her
in any way in the disposal of it

After tea the two gents walked away together and Gus told me that
Smithers had asked him a thousand questions about the office about
Brough about me and my wife and everything concerning us You are a
lucky fellow Mr Hoskins and seem to be the friend of this charming
young couple said Smithers and Gus confessed he was and said he had
dined with us fifteen times in six weeks and that a better and more
hospitable fellow than I did not exist This I state not to trumpet my
own praisesno no but because these questions of Smitherss had a
good deal to do with the subsequent events narrated in this little
history

Being seated at dinner the next day off the cold leg of mutton that
Smithers had admired so the day before and Gus as usual having his legs
under our mahogany a hackneycoach drove up to the door which we did
not much heed a step was heard on the floor which we hoped might be for
the twopair lodger when who should burst into the room but Mrs
Hoggarty herself Gus who was blowing the froth off a pot of porter
preparatory to a delicious drink of the beverage and had been making us
die of laughing with his stories and jokes laid down the pewter pot as
Mrs H came in and looked quite sick and pale Indeed we all felt a
little uneasy

My aunt looked haughtily in Marys face then fiercely at Gus and
saying It is too truemy poor boy_already_ flung herself
hysterically into my arms and swore almost choking that she would
never never leave me

I could not understand the meaning of this extraordinary agitation on
Mrs Hoggartys part nor could any of us She refused Marys hand when
the poor thing rather nervously offered it and when Gus timidly said I
think Sam Im rather in the way here and perhapshad better go Mrs
H looked him full in the face pointed to the door majestically with her
forefinger and said I think sir you _had_ better go

I hope Mr Hoskins will stay as long as he pleases said my wife with
spirit

_Of course_ you hope so madam answered Mrs Hoggarty very sarcastic
But Marys speech and my aunts were quite lost upon Gus for he had
instantly run to his hat and I heard him tumbling downstairs

The quarrel ended as usual by Marys bursting into a fit of tears and
by my aunts repeating the assertion that it was not too late she
trusted and from that day forth she would never never leave me

What could have made Aunt return and be so angry said I to Mary that
night as we were in our own room but my wife protested she did not
know and it was only some time after that I found out the reason of this
quarrel and of Mrs Hs sudden reappearance

The horrible fat coarse little Smithers told me the matter as a very good
joke only the other year when he showed me the letter of Hickson
Dixon Paxton and Jackson which has before been quoted in my Memoirs

Sam my boy said he you were determined to leave Mrs Hoggarty in
Broughs clutches at the Rookery and I was determined to have her away
I resolved to kill two of your mortal enemies with one stone as it were
It was quite clear to me that the Reverend Grimes Wapshot had an eye to
your aunts fortune and that Mr Brough had similar predatory intentions
regarding her Predatory is a mild word Sam if I had said robbery at
once I should express my meaning clearer

Well I took the Fulham stage and arriving made straight for the
lodgings of the reverend gentleman Sir said I on finding that
worthy genthe was drinking warm brandyandwater Sam at two oclock
in the day or at least the room smelt very strongly of that
beverageSir says I you were tried for forgery in the year 14 at
Lancaster assizes

And acquitted sir My innocence was by Providence made clear said
Wapshot

But you were not acquitted of embezzlement in 16 sir says I and
passed two years in York Gaol in consequence I knew the fellows
history for I had a writ out against him when he was a preacher at
Clifton I followed up my blow Mr Wapshot said I you are making
love to an excellent lady now at the house of Mr Brough if you do not
promise to give up all pursuit of her I will expose you

I _have_ promised said Wapshot rather surprised and looking more
easy I have given my solemn promise to Mr Brough who was with me
this very morning storming and scolding and swearing Oh sir it
would have frightened you to hear a Christian babe like him swear as he
did

Mr Brough been here says I rather astonished

Yes I suppose you are both here on the same scent says Wapshot You
want to marry the widow with the Slopperton and Squashtail estate do
you Well well have your way Ive promised not to have anything more
to do with the widow and a Wapshots honour is sacred

I suppose sir says I Mr Brough has threatened to kick you out of
doors if you call again

You _have_ been with him I see says the reverend gent with a shrug
then I remembered what you had told me of the broken seal of your letter
and have not the slightest doubt that Brough opened and read every word
of it

Well the first bird was bagged both I and Brough had had a shot at
him Now I had to fire at the whole Rookery and off I went primed and
loaded sirprimed and loaded

It was past eight when I arrived and I saw after I passed the lodge
gates a figure that I knew walking in the shrubberythat of your
respected aunt sir but I wished to meet the amiable ladies of the house
before I saw her because look friend Titmarsh I saw by Mrs Hoggartys
letter that she and they were at daggers drawn and hoped to get her out
of the house at once by means of a quarrel with them

I laughed and owned that Mr Smithers was a very cunning fellow

As luck would have it continued he Miss Brough was in the drawing
room twangling on a guitar and singing most atrociously out of tune but
as I entered at the door I cried Hush to the footman as loud as
possible stood stockstill and then walked forward on tiptoe lightly
Miss B could see in the glass every movement that I made she pretended
not to see however and finished the song with a regular roulade

Gracious Heaven said I do madam pardon me for interrupting that
delicious harmonyfor coming unaware upon it for daring uninvited to
listen to it

Do you come for Mamma sir said Miss Brough with as much
graciousness as her physiognomy could command I am Miss Brough sir

I wish madam you would let me not breathe a word regarding my
business until you have sung another charming strain

She did not sing but looked pleased and said La sir what is your
business

My business is with a lady your respected fathers guest in this
house

Oh Mrs Hoggarty says Miss Brough flouncing towards the bell and
ringing it John send to Mrs Hoggarty in the shrubbery here is a
gentleman who wants to see her

I know continued I Mrs Hoggartys peculiarities as well as anyone
madam and aware that those and her education are not such as to make her
a fit companion for you I know you do not like her she has written to
us in Somersetshire that you do not like her

What she has been abusing us to her friends has she cried Miss
Brough it was the very point I wished to insinuate If she does not
like us why does she not leave us

She _has_ made rather a long visit said I and I am sure that her
nephew and niece are longing for her return Pray madam do not move
for you may aid me in the object for which I come

The object for which I came sir was to establish a regular
battleroyal between the two ladies at the end of which I intended to
appeal to Mrs Hoggarty and say that she ought really no longer to stay
in a house with the members of which she had such unhappy differences
Well sir the battleroyal was foughtMiss Belinda opening the fire
by saying she understood Mrs Hoggarty had been calumniating her to her
friends But though at the end of it Miss rushed out of the room in a
rage and vowed she would leave her home unless that odious woman left
it your dear aunt said Ha ha I know the minxs vile stratagems
but thank Heaven I have a good heart and my religion enables me to
forgive her I shall not leave her excellent papas house or vex by my
departure that worthy admirable man

I then tried Mrs H on the score of compassion Your niece said I
Mrs Titmarsh madam has been of late Sam says rather
poorlyqualmish of mornings madama little nervous and low in
spiritssymptoms madam that are scarcely to be mistaken in a young
married person

Mrs Hoggarty said she had an admirable cordial that she would send Mrs
Samuel Titmarsh and she was perfectly certain it would do her good

With very great unwillingness I was obliged now to bring my last reserve
into the field and may tell you what that was Sam my boy now that the
matter is so long passed Madam said I theres a matter about which
I must speak though indeed I scarcely dare I dined with your nephew
yesterday and met at his table a young mana young man of low manners
but evidently one who has blinded your nephew and I too much fear has
succeeded in making an impression upon your niece His name is Hoskins
madam and when I state that he who was never in the house during your
presence there has dined with your too confiding nephew sixteen times in
three weeks I may leave you to imagine what I dare notdare not imagine
myself

The shot told Your aunt bounced up at once and in ten minutes more
was in my carriage on our way back to London There sir was not that
generalship

And you played this pretty trick off at my wifes expense Mr
Smithers said I

At your wifes expense certainly but for the benefit of both of you

Its lucky sir that you are an old man I replied and that the
affair happened ten years ago or by the Lord Mr Smithers I would
have given you such a horsewhipping as you never heard of

But this was the way in which Mrs Hoggarty was brought back to her
relatives and this was the reason why we took that house in Bernard
Street the doings at which must now he described




CHAPTER X


OF SAMS PRIVATE AFFAIRS AND OF THE FIRM OF BROUGH AND HOFF

We took a genteel house in Bernard Street Russell Square and my aunt
sent for all her furniture from the country which would have filled two
such houses but which came pretty cheap to us young housekeepers as we
had only to pay the carriage of the goods from Bristol

When I brought Mrs H her third halfyears dividend having not for
four months touched a shilling of her money I must say she gave me
50_l_ of the 80_l_ and told me that was ample pay for the board and
lodging of a poor old woman like her who did not eat more than a
sparrow

I have myself in the country seen her eat nine sparrows in a pudding
but she was rich and I could not complain If she saved 600_l_ a year
at the least by living with us why all the savings would one day come
to me and so Mary and I consoled ourselves and tried to manage matters
as well as we might It was no easy task to keep a mansion in Bernard
Street and save money out of 470_l_ a year which was my income But
what a lucky fellow I was to have such an income

As Mrs Hoggarty left the Rookery in Smitherss carriage Mr Brough
with his four greys was entering the lodgegate and I should like to
have seen the looks of these two gentlemen as the one was carrying the
others prey off out of his own very den under his very nose

He came to see her the next day and protested that he would not leave
the house until she left it with him that he had heard of his daughters
infamous conduct and had seen her in tearsin tears madam and on her
knees imploring Heaven to pardon her But Mr B was obliged to leave
the house without my aunt who had a _causa major_ for staying and
hardly allowed poor Mary out of her sightopening every one of the
letters that came into the house directed to my wife and suspecting hers
to everybody Mary never told me of all this pain for many many years
afterwards but had always a smiling face for her husband when he came
home from his work As for poor Gus my aunt had so frightened him that
he never once showed his nose in the place all the time we lived there
but used to be content with news of Mary of whom he was as fond as he
was of me

Mr Brough when my aunt left him was in a furious illhumour with me
He found fault with me ten times a day and openly before the gents of
the office but I let him one day know pretty smartly that I was not only
a servant but a considerable shareholder in the company that I defied
him to find fault with my work or my regularity and that I was not
minded to receive any insolent language from him or any man He said it
was always so that he had never cherished a young man in his bosom but
the ingrate had turned on him that he was accustomed to wrong and
undutifulness from his children and that he would pray that the sin
might be forgiven me A moment before he had been cursing and swearing
at me and speaking to me as if I had been his shoeblack But look you
I was not going to put up with any more of Madam Broughs airs or of
his With me they might act as they thought fit but I did not choose
that my wife should be passed over by them as she had been in the matter
of the visit to Fulham

Brough ended by warning me of Hodge and Smithers Beware of these men
said he but for my honesty your aunts landed property would have been
sacrificed by these cormorants and when for her benefitwhich you
obstinate young man will not perceiveI wished to dispose of her land
her attorneys actually had the audacitythe unchristian avarice I may
sayto ask ten per cent commission on the sale

There might be some truth in this I thought at any rate when rogues
fall out honest men come by their own and now I began to suspect I am
sorry to say that both the attorney and the Director had a little of the
rogue in their composition It was especially about my wifes fortune
that Mr B showed _his_ cloven foot for proposing as usual that I
should purchase shares with it in our Company I told him that my wife
was a minor and as such her little fortune was vested out of my control
altogether He flung away in a rage at this and I soon saw that he did
not care for me any more by Abednegos manner to me No more holidays
no more advances of money had I on the contrary the private clerkship
at 150_l_ was abolished and I found myself on my 250_l_ a year again
Well what then it was always a good income and I did my duty and
laughed at the Director

About this time in the beginning of 1824 the Jamaica Ginger Beer
Company shut up shopexploded as Gus said with a bang The Patent
Pump shares were down to 15_l_ upon a paidup capital of 65_l_ Still
ours were at a high premium and the Independent West Diddlesex held its
head up as proudly as any office in London Roundhands abuse had had
some influence against the Director certainly for he hinted at
malversation of shares but the Company still stood as united as the Hand
inHand and as firm as the Rock

To return to the state of affairs in Bernard Street Russell Square my
aunts old furniture crammed our little rooms and my aunts enormous old
jingling grand piano with crooked legs and half the strings broken
occupied threefourths of the little drawingroom Here used Mrs H to
sit and play us for hours sonatas that were in fashion in Lord
Charlevilles time and sung with a cracked voice till it was all that
we could do to refrain from laughing

And it was queer to remark the change that had taken place in Mrs
Hoggartys character now for whereas she was in the country among the
topping persons of the village and quite content with a teaparty at six
and a game of twopenny whist afterwardsin London she would never dine
till seven would have a fly from the mews to drive in the Park twice a
week cut and uncut and ripped up and twisted over and over all her old
gowns flounces caps and fallals and kept my poor Mary from morning
till night altering them to the present mode Mrs Hoggarty moreover
appeared in a new wig and I am sorry to say turned out with such a
pair of red cheeks as Nature never gave her and as made all the people
in Bernard Street stare where they are not as yet used to such fashions

Moreover she insisted upon our establishing a servant in liverya boy
that is of about sixteenwho was dressed in one of the old liveries
that she had brought with her from Somersetshire decorated with new
cuffs and collars and new buttons on the latter were represented the
united crests of the Titmarshes and Hoggartys viz a tomtit rampant and
a hog in armour I thought this livery and crestbutton rather absurd I
must confess though my family is very ancient And heavens what a roar
of laughter was raised in the office one day when the little servant in
the big livery with the immense cane walked in and brought me a message
from Mrs Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty Furthermore all letters were
delivered on a silver tray If we had had a baby I believe Aunt would
have had it down on the tray but there was as yet no foundation for Mr
Smitherss insinuation upon that score any more than for his other
cowardly fabrication before narrated Aunt and Mary used to walk gravely
up and down the New Road with the boy following with his great
goldheaded stick but though there was all this ceremony and parade and
Aunt still talked of her acquaintances we did not see a single person
from weeks end to weeks end and a more dismal house than ours could
hardly be found in London town

On Sundays Mrs Hoggarty used to go to St Pancras Church then just
built and as handsome as Covent Garden Theatre and of evenings to a
meetinghouse of the Anabaptists and that day at least Mary and I had
to ourselvesfor we chose to have seats at the Foundling and heard the
charming music there and my wife used to look wistfully in the pretty
childrens facesand so for the matter of that did I It was not
however till a year after our marriage that she spoke in a way which
shall be here passed over but which filled both her and me with
inexpressible joy

I remember she had the news to give me on the very day when the Muff and
Tippet Company shut up after swallowing a capital of 300000_l_ as some
said and nothing to show for it except a treaty with some Indians who
had afterwards tomahawked the agent of the Company Some people said
there were no Indians and no agent to be tomahawked at all but that the
whole had been invented in a house in Crutched Friars Well I pitied
poor Tidd whose 20000_l_ were thus gone in a year and whom I met in
the City that day with a most ghastly face He had 1000_l_ of debts
he said and talked of shooting himself but he was only arrested and
passed a long time in the Fleet Marys delightful news however soon
put Tidd and the Muff and Tippet Company out of my head as you may
fancy

Other circumstances now occurred in the City of London which seemed to
show that our Director waswhat is not to be found in Johnsons
Dictionaryrather shaky Three of his companies had broken four more
were in a notoriously insolvent state and even at the meetings of the
directors of the West Diddlesex some stormy words passed which ended in
the retirement of several of the board Friends of Mr Bs filled up
their places Mr Puppet Mr Straw Mr Query and other respectable
gents coming forward and joining the concern Brough and Hoff dissolved
partnership and Mr B said he had quite enough to do to manage the I
W D and intended gradually to retire from the other affairs Indeed
such an Association as ours was enough work for any man let alone the
parliamentary duties which Brough was called on to perform and the
seventytwo lawsuits which burst upon him as principal director of the
late companies

Perhaps I should here describe the desperate attempts made by Mrs
Hoggarty to introduce herself into genteel life Strange to say
although we had my Lord Tiptoffs word to the contrary she insisted upon
it that she and Lady Drum were intimately related and no sooner did she
read in the _Morning Post_ of the arrival of her Ladyship and her
granddaughters in London than she ordered the fly before mentioned and
left cards at their respective houses her card that isMRS HOGGARTY
of CASTLE HOGGARTY magnificently engraved in Gothic letters and
flourishes and ours viz Mr and Mrs S Titmarsh which she had
printed for the purpose

She would have stormed Lady Jane Prestons door and forced her way
upstairs in spite of Marys entreaties to the contrary had the footman
who received her card given her the least encouragement but that
functionary no doubt struck by the oddity of her appearance placed
himself in the front of the door and declared that he had positive
orders not to admit any strangers to his lady On which Mrs Hoggarty
clenched her fist out of the coachwindow and promised that she would
have him turned away

Yellowplush only burst out laughing at this and though Aunt wrote a most
indignant letter to Mr Edmund Preston complaining of the insolence of
the servants of that right honourable gent Mr Preston did not take any
notice of her letter further than to return it with a desire that he
might not be troubled with such impertinent visits for the future A
pretty day we had of it when this letter arrived owing to my aunts
disappointment and rage in reading the contents for when Solomon brought
up the note on the silver teatray as usual my aunt seeing Mr
Prestons seal and name at the corner of the letter which is the common
way of writing adopted by those official gentsmy aunt I say seeing
his name and seal cried _Now_ Mary who is right and betted my wife
a sixpence that the envelope contained an invitation to dinner She
never paid the sixpence though she lost but contented herself by
abusing Mary all day and said I was a poorspirited sneak for not
instantly horsewhipping Mr P A pretty joke indeed They would have
hanged me in those days as they did the man who shot Mr Perceval

And now I should be glad to enlarge upon that experience in genteel life
which I obtained through the perseverance of Mrs Hoggarty but it must
be owned that my opportunities were but few lasting only for the brief
period of six months and also genteel society has been fully described
already by various authors of novels whose names need not here be set
down but who being themselves connected with the aristocracy viz as
members of noble families or as footmen or hangerson thereof naturally
understand their subject a great deal better than a poor young fellow
from a fireoffice can

There was our celebrated adventure in the Opera House whither Mrs H
would insist upon conducting us and where in a room of the
establishment called the crushroom where the ladies and gents after the
music and dancing await the arrival of their carriages a pretty figure
did our little Solomon cut by the way with his big cane among the
gentlemen of the shoulderknot assembled in the lobbywhere I say in
the crushroom Mrs H rushed up to old Lady Drum whom I pointed out to
her and insisted upon claiming relationship with her Ladyship But my
Lady Drum had only a memory when she chose as I may say and had
entirely on this occasion thought fit to forget her connection with the
Titmarshes and Hoggarties Far from recognising us indeed she called
Mrs Hoggarty an ojus oman and screamed out as loud as possible for a
policeofficer

This and other rebuffs made my aunt perceive the vanities of this wicked
world as she said and threw her more and more into really serious
society She formed several very valuable acquaintances she said at
the Independent Chapel and among others lighted upon her friend of the
Rookery Mr Grimes Wapshot We did not know then the interview which he
had had with Mr Smithers nor did Grimes think proper to acquaint us
with the particulars of it but though I did acquaint Mrs H with the
fact that her favourite preacher had been tried for forgery _she_
replied that she considered the story an atrocious calumny and _he_
answered by saying that Mary and I were in lamentable darkness and that
we should infallibly find the way to a certain bottomless pit of which
he seemed to know a great deal Under the reverend gentlemans guidance
and advice she after a time separated from St Pancras
altogether_sat under him_ as the phrase is regularly thrice a
weekbegan to labour in the conversion of the poor of Bloomsbury and St
Giless and made a deal of babylinen for distribution among those
benighted people She did not make any however for Mrs Sam Titmarsh
who now showed signs that such would be speedily necessary but let Mary
and my mother and sisters in Somersetshire provide what was requisite
for the coming event I am not indeed sure that she did not say it was
wrong on our parts to make any such provision and that we ought to let
the morrow provide for itself At any rate the Reverend Grimes Wapshot
drank a deal of brandyandwater at our house and dined there even
oftener than poor Gus used to do

But I had little leisure to attend to him and his doings for I must
confess at this time I was growing very embarrassed in my circumstances
and was much harassed both as a private and public character

As regards the former Mrs Hoggarty had given me 50_l_ but out of that
50_l_ I had to pay a journey post from Somersetshire all the carriage
of her goods from the country the painting papering and carpeting of
my house the brandy and strong liquors drunk by the Reverend Grimes and
his friends for the reverend gent said that Rosolio did not agree with
him and finally a thousand small bills and expenses incident to all
housekeepers in the town of London

Add to this I received just at the time when I was most in want of cash
Madame Mantalinis bill Messrs Howell and Jamess ditto the account
of Baron Von Stiltz and the bill of Mr Polonius for the setting of the
diamond pin All these bills arrived in a week as they have a knack of
doing and fancy my astonishment in presenting them to Mrs Hoggarty
when she said Well my dear you are in the receipt of a very fine
income If you choose to order dresses and jewels from firstrate shops
you must pay for them and dont expect that _I_ am to abet your
extravagance or give you a shilling more than the munificent sum I pay
you for board and lodging

How could I tell Mary of this behaviour of Mrs Hoggarty and Mary in
such a delicate condition And bad as matters were at home I am sorry
to say at the office they began to look still worse

Not only did Roundhand leave but Highmore went away Abednego became
head clerk and one day old Abednego came to the place and was shown into
the directors private room when he left it he came trembling
chattering and cursing downstairs and had begun Shentlemen a
speech to the very clerks in the office when Mr Brough with an
imploring look and crying out Stop till Saturday at length got him
into the street

On Saturday Abednego junior left the office for ever and I became head
clerk with 400_l_ a year salary It was a fatal week for the office
too On Monday when I arrived and took my seat at the head desk and my
first read of the newspaper as was my right the first thing I read was
Frightful fire in Houndsditch Total destruction of Mr Meshachs
sealingwax manufactory and of Mr Shadrachs clothing depot adjoining
In the former was 20000_l_ worth of the finest Dutch wax which the
voracious element attacked and devoured in a twinkling The latter
estimable gentleman had just completed forty thousand suits of clothes
for the cavalry of HH the Cacique of Poyais

Both of these Jewish gents who were connections of Mr Abednego were
insured in our office to the full amount of their loss The calamity was
attributed to the drunkenness of a scoundrelly Irish watchman who was
employed on the premises and who upset a bottle of whisky in the
warehouse of Messrs Shadrach and incautiously looked for the liquor
with a lighted candle The man was brought to our office by his
employers and certainly as we all could testify was _even then_ in a
state of frightful intoxication

As if this were not sufficient in the obituary was announced the demise
of Alderman PashAlderman CallyPash we used to call him in our lighter
hours knowing his propensity to green fat but such a moment as this was
no time for joking He was insured by our house for 5000_l_ And now I
saw very well the truth of a remark of Gussviz that lifeassurance
companies go on excellently for a year or two after their establishment
but that it is much more difficult to make them profitable when the
assured parties begin to die

The Jewish fires were the heaviest blows we had had for though the
Waddingley Cottonmills had been burnt in 1822 at a loss to the Company
of 80000_l_ and though the Patent Erostratus Match Manufactory had
exploded in the same year at a charge of 14000_l_ there were those who
said that the loss had not been near so heavy as was supposednay that
the Company had burnt the abovenamed establishments as advertisements
for themselves Of these facts I cant be positive having never seen
the early accounts of the concern

Contrary to the expectation of all us gents who were ourselves as dismal
as mutes Mr Brough came to the office in his coachandfour laughing
and joking with a friend as he stepped out at the door

Gentlemen said he you have read the papers they announce an event
which I most deeply deplore I mean the demise of the excellent Alderman
Pash one of our constituents But if anything can console me for the
loss of that worthy man it is to think that his children and widow will
receive at eleven oclock next Saturday 5000_l_ from my friend Mr
Titmarsh who is now head clerk here As for the accident which has
happened to Messrs Shadrach and Meshachin _that_ at least there is
nothing that can occasion any person sorrow On Saturday next or as
soon as the particulars of their loss can be satisfactorily ascertained
my friend Mr Titmarsh will pay to them across the counter a sum of
forty fifty eighty one hundred thousand poundsaccording to the
amount of their loss _They_ at least will be remunerated and though
to our proprietors the outlay will no doubt be considerable yet we can
afford it gentlemen John Brough can afford it himself for the matter
of that and not be very much embarrassed and we must learn to bear ill
fortune as we have hitherto borne good and show ourselves to be men
always

Mr B concluded with some allusions which I confess I dont like to
give here for to speak of Heaven in connection with common worldly
matters has always appeared to me irreverent and to bring it to bear
witness to the lie in his mouth as a religious hypocrite does is such a
frightful crime that one should be careful even in alluding to it

Mr Broughs speech somehow found its way into the newspapers of that
very evening nor can I think who gave a report of it for none of our
gents left the office that day until the evening papers had appeared But
there was the speechay and at the weeks end although Roundhand was
heard on Change that day declaring he would bet five to one that
Alderman Pashs money would never be paidat the weeks end the money
was paid by me to Mrs Pashs solicitor across the counter and no doubt
Roundhand lost his money

Shall I tell how the money was procured There can be no harm in
mentioning the matter now after twenty years lapse of time and
moreover it is greatly to the credit of two individuals now dead

As I was head clerk I had occasion to be frequently in Broughs room
and he now seemed once more disposed to take me into his confidence

Titmarsh my boy said he one day to me after looking me hard in the
face did you ever hear of the fate of the great Mr Silberschmidt of
London Of course I had Mr Silberschmidt the Rothschild of his day
indeed I have heard the latter famous gent was originally a clerk in
Silberschmidts houseSilberschmidt fancying he could not meet his
engagements committed suicide and had he lived till four oclock that
day would have known that he was worth 400000_l_ To tell you frankly
the truth says Mr B I am in Silberschmidts case My late partner
Hoff has given bills in the name of the firm to an enormous amount and
I have been obliged to meet them I have been cast in fourteen actions
brought by creditors of that infernal Ginger Beer Company and all the
debts are put upon my shoulders on account of my known wealth Now
unless I have time I cannot pay and the long and short of the matter is
that if I cannot procure 5000_l_ before Saturday _our concern is
ruined_

What the West Diddlesex ruined says I thinking of my poor mothers
annuity Impossible our business is splendid

We must have 5000_l_ on Saturday and we are saved and if you will
as you can get it for me I will give you 10000_l_ for the money

B then showed me to a fraction the accounts of the concern and his own
private account proving beyond the possibility of a doubt that with the
5000_l_ our office must be set agoing and without it that the
concern must stop No matter how he proved the thing but there is you
know a dictum of a statesman that give him but leave to use figures
and he will prove anything

I promised to ask Mrs Hoggarty once more for the money and she seemed
not to be disinclined I told him so and that day he called upon her
his wife called upon her his daughter called upon her and once more the
Brough carriageandfour was seen at our house

But Mrs Brough was a bad manager and instead of carrying matters with
a high hand fairly burst into tears before Mrs Hoggarty and went down
on her knees and besought her to save dear John This at once aroused my
aunts suspicions and instead of lending the money she wrote off to Mr
Smithers instantly to come up to her desired me to give her up the
3000_l_ scrip shares that I possessed called me an atrocious cheat and
heartless swindler and vowed I had been the cause of her ruin

How was Mr Brough to get the money I will tell you Being in his room
one day old Gates the Fulham porter came and brought him from Mr Balls
the pawnbroker a sum of 1200_l_ Missus told him he said to carry
the plate to Mr Balls and having paid the money old Gates fumbled a
great deal in his pockets and at last pulled out a 5_l_ note which he
said his daughter Jane had just sent him from service and begged Mr B
would let him have another share in the Company He was mortal sure it
would go right yet And when he heard master crying and cursing as he
and missus were walking in the shrubbery and saying that for the want of
a few poundsa few shillingsthe finest fortune in Europe was to be
overthrown why Gates and his woman thought that they should come
forard to be sure with all they could to help the kindest master and
missus ever was

This was the substance of Gatess speech and Mr Brough shook his hand
andtook the 5_l_ Gates said he that 5_l_ note shall be the best
outlay you ever made in your life and I have no doubt it wasbut it
was in heaven that poor old Gates was to get the interest of his little
mite

Nor was this the only instance Mrs Broughs sister Miss Dough who
had been on bad terms with the Director almost ever since he had risen to
be a great man came to the office with a power of attorney and said
John Isabella has been with me this morning and says you want money
and I have brought you my 4000_l_ it is all I have John and pray God
it may do you goodyou and my dear sister who was the best sister in
the world to metilltill a little time ago

And she laid down the paper I was called up to witness it and Brough
with tears in his eyes told me her words for he could trust me he
said And thus it was that I came to be present at Gatess interview
with his master which took place only an hour afterwards Brave Mrs
Brough how she was working for her husband Good woman and kind but
_you_ had a true heart and merited a better fate Though wherefore say
so The woman to this day thinks her husband an angel and loves him a
thousand times better for his misfortunes

On Saturday Alderman Pashs solicitor was paid by me across the counter
as I said Never mind your aunts money Titmarsh my boy said Brough
never mind her having resumed her shares You are a true honest fellow
you have never abused me like that pack of curs downstairs and Ill make
your fortune yet

    

The next week as I was sitting with my wife with Mr Smithers and with
Mrs Hoggarty taking our tea comfortably a knock was heard at the door
and a gentleman desired to speak to me in the parlour It was Mr
Aminadab of Chancery Lane who arrested me as a shareholder of the
Independent West Diddlesex Association at the suit of Von Stiltz of
Clifford Street tailor and draper

I called down Smithers and told him for Heavens sake not to tell Mary

Where is Brough says Mr Smithers

Why says Mr Aminadab hes once more of the firm of Brough and Off
sirhe breakfasted at Calais this morning




CHAPTER XI


IN WHICH IT APPEARS THAT A MAN MAY POSSESS A DIAMOND AND YET BE VERY HARD
PRESSED FOR A DINNER

On that fatal Saturday evening in a hackneycoach fetched from the
Foundling was I taken from my comfortable house and my dear little wife
whom Mr Smithers was left to console as he might He said that I was
compelled to take a journey upon business connected with the office and
my poor Mary made up a little portmanteau of clothes and tied a
comforter round my neck and bade my companion particularly to keep the
coach windows shut which injunction the grinning wretch promised to
obey Our journey was not long it was only a shilling fare to Cursitor
Street Chancery Lane and there I was set down

The house before which the coach stopped seemed to be only one of halfa
dozen in that street which were used for the same purpose No man be he
ever so rich can pass by those dismal houses I think without a
shudder The front windows are barred and on the dingy pillar of the
door was a shining brassplate setting forth that Aminadab Officer to
the Sheriff of Middlesex lived therein A little redhaired Israelite
opened the first door as our coach drove up and received me and my
baggage

As soon as we entered the door he barred it and I found myself in the
face of another huge door which was strongly locked and at last
passing through that we entered the lobby of the house

There is no need to describe it It is very like ten thousand other
houses in our dark City of London There was a dirty passage and a dirty
stair and from the passage two dirty doors let into two filthy rooms
which had strong bars at the windows and yet withal an air of horrible
finery that makes me uncomfortable to think of even yet On the walls
hung all sorts of trumpery pictures in tawdry frames how different from
those capital performances of my cousin Michael Angelo on the
mantelpiece huge French clocks vases and candlesticks on the
sideboards enormous trays of Birmingham plated ware for Mr Aminadab
not only arrested those who could not pay money but lent it to those who
could and had already in the way of trade sold and bought these
articles many times over

I agreed to take the backparlour for the night and while a Hebrew
damsel was arranging a little dusky sofabedstead woe betide him who has
to sleep on it I was invited into the front parlour where Mr
Aminadab bidding me take heart told me I should have a dinner for
nothing with a party who had just arrived I did not want for dinner
but I was glad not to be alonenot alone even till Gus came for whom I
despatched a messenger to his lodgings hard by

I found there in the front parlour at eight oclock in the evening
four gentlemen just about to sit down to dinner Surprising there was
Mr B a gentleman of fashion who had only within halfanhour arrived
in a postchaise with his companion Mr Lock an officer of Horsham
gaol Mr B was arrested in this wiseHe was a careless goodhumoured
gentleman and had indorsed bills to a large amount for a friend who a
man of high family and unquestionable honour had pledged the latter
along with a number of the most solemn oaths for the payment of the
bills in question Having indorsed the notes young Mr B with a
proper thoughtlessness forgot all about them and so by some chance
did the friend whom he obliged for instead of being in London with the
money for the payment of his obligations this latter gentleman was
travelling abroad and never hinted one word to Mr B that the notes
would fall upon him The young gentleman was at Brighton lying sick of a
fever was taken from his bed by a bailiff and carried on a rainy day
to Horsham gaol had a relapse of his complaint and when sufficiently
recovered was brought up to London to the house of Mr Aminadab where I
found hima pale thin goodhumoured _lost_ young man he was lying on
a sofa and had given orders for the dinner to which I was invited The
lads face gave one pain to look at it was impossible not to see that
his hours were numbered

Now Mr B has not anything to do with my humble story but I cant help
mentioning him as I saw him He sent for his lawyer and his doctor the
former settled speedily his accounts with the bailiff and the latter
arranged all his earthly accounts for after he went from the spunging
house he never recovered from the shock of the arrest and in a few weeks
he _died_ And though this circumstance took place many years ago I
cant forget it to my dying day and often see the author of Mr Bs
deatha prosperous gentleman riding a fine horse in the Park lounging
at the window of a club with many friends no doubt and a good
reputation I wonder whether the man sleeps easily and eats with a good
appetite I wonder whether he has paid Mr Bs heirs the sum which that
gentleman paid and _died for_

If Mr Bs history has nothing to do with mine and is only inserted
here for the sake of a moral what business have I to mention particulars
of the dinner to which I was treated by that gentleman in the spunging
house in Cursitor Street Why for the moral too and therefore the
public must be told of what really and truly that dinner consisted

There were five guests and three silver tureens of soup viz
mockturtle soup oxtail soup and giblet soup Next came a great piece
of salmon likewise on a silver dish a roast goose a roast saddle of
mutton roast game and all sorts of adjuncts In this way can a
gentleman live in a spunginghouse if he be inclined and over this
repast which in truth I could not touch for let alone having dined
my heart was full of careover this meal my friend Gus Hoskins found
me when he received the letter that I had despatched to him

Gus who had never been in a prison before and whose heart failed him as
the redheaded young Moses opened and shut for him the numerous iron
outer doors was struck dumb to see me behind a bottle of claret in a
room blazing with gilt lamps the curtains were down too and you could
not see the bars at the windows and Mr B Mr Lock the Brighton
officer Mr Aminadab and another rich gentleman of his trade and
religious persuasion were chirping as merrily and looked as
respectably as any noblemen in the land

Have him in said Mr B if hes a friend of Mr Titmarshs for
cuss me I like to see a rogue and run me through Titmarsh but I think
you are one of the best in London You beat Brough you do by Jove for
he looks like a rogueanybody would swear to him but you by Jove you
look the very picture of honesty

A deep file said Aminadab winking and pointing me out to his friend
Mr Jehoshaphat

A good one says Jehoshaphat

In for three hundred thousand pound says Aminadab Broughs right
hand man and only threeandtwenty

Mr Titmarsh sir your ealth sir says Mr Lock in an ecstasy of
admiration Your very good earth sir and better luck to you next
time

Pooh pooh _hes_ all right says Aminadab let _him_ alone

In for _what_ shouted I quite amazed Why sir you arrested me for
90_l_

Yes but you are in for half a millionyou know you are _Them_ debts
I dont countthem paltry tradesmens accounts I mean Broughs
business Its an ugly one but youll get through it We all know you
and I lay my life that when you come through the court Mrs Titmarsh has
got a handsome thing laid by

Mrs Titmarsh has a small property says I What then

The three gentlemen burst into a loud laugh said I was a rum chapa
downy cove and made other remarks which I could not understand then
but the meaning of which I have since comprehended for they took me to
be a great rascal I am sorry to say and supposed that I had robbed the
I W D Association and in order to make my money secure settled it
on my wife

It was in the midst of this conversation that as I said Gus came in
and whew when he saw what was going on he gave _such_ a whistle

Herr von Joel by Jove says Aminadab At which all laughed

Sit down says Mr Bsit down and wet your whistle my piper I
say egad youre the piper that played before Moses Had you there
Dab Dab get a fresh bottle of Burgundy for Mr Hoskins And before
he knew where he was there was Gus for the first time in his life
drinking ClosVougeot Gus said he had never tasted Bergamy before at
which the bailiff sneered and told him the name of the wine

_Old Clo_ What says Gus and we laughed but the Hebrew gents did
not this time

Come come sir says Mr Aminadabs friend vere all shentlemen
here and shentlemen never makish reflexunsh upon other gentlemensh
pershuashunsh

After this feast was concluded Gus and I retired to my room to consult
about my affairs With regard to the responsibility incurred as a
shareholder in the West Diddlesex I was not uneasy for though the
matter might cause me a little trouble at first I knew I was not a
shareholder that the shares were scrip shares making the dividend
payable to the bearer and my aunt had called back her shares and
consequently I was free But it was very unpleasant to me to consider
that I was in debt nearly a hundred pounds to tradesmen chiefly of Mrs
Hoggartys recommendation and as she had promised to be answerable for
their bills I determined to send her a letter reminding her of her
promise and begging her at the same time to relieve me from Mr Von
Stiltzs debt for which I was arrested and which was incurred not
certainly at her desire but at Mr Broughs and would never have been
incurred by me but at the absolute demand of that gentleman

I wrote to her therefore begging her to pay all these debts and
promised myself on Monday morning again to be with my dear wife Gus
carried off the letter and promised to deliver it in Bernhard Street
after churchtime taking care that Mary should know nothing at all of
the painful situation in which I was placed It was near midnight when
we parted and I tried to sleep as well as I could in the dirty little
sofabedstead of Mr Aminadabs backparlour

That morning was fine and sunshiny and I heard all the bells ringing
cheerfully for church and longed to be walking to the Foundling with my
wife but there were the three iron doors between me and liberty and I
had nothing for it but to read my prayers in my own room and walk up and
down afterwards in the court at the back of the house Would you believe
it This very court was like a cage Great iron bars covered it in from
one end to another and here it was that Mr Aminadabs gaolbirds took
the air

They had seen me reading out of the prayerbook at the backparlour
window and all burst into a yell of laughter when I came to walk in the
cage One of them shouted out Amen when I appeared another called me
a muff which means in the slang language a very silly fellow a third
wondered that I took to my prayerbook _yet_

When do you mean sir says I to the fellowa rough man a
horsedealer

Why when you are going _to be hanged_ you young hypocrite says the
man But that is always the way with Broughs people continued he I
had four greys once for hima great bargain but he would not go to look
at them at Tattersalls nor speak a word of business about them because
it was a Sunday

Because there are hypocrites sir says I religion is not to be
considered a bad thing and if Mr Brough would not deal with you on a
Sunday he certainly did his duty

The men only laughed the more at this rebuke and evidently considered me
a great criminal I was glad to be released from their society by the
appearance of Gus and Mr Smithers Both wore very long faces They
were ushered into my room and without any orders of mine a bottle of
wine and biscuits were brought in by Mr Aminadab which I really thought
was very kind of him

Drink a glass of wine Mr Titmarsh says Smithers and read this
letter A pretty note was that which you sent to your aunt this morning
and here you have an answer to it

I drank the wine and trembled rather as I read as follows

 SirIf because you knew I had desined to leave you my proparty
 you wished to murdar me and so stepp into it you are dissapointed
 Your _villiany_ and _ingratitude would_ have murdard me had I not by
 Heavens grace been inabled to look for consalation _elsewhere_

 For nearly a year I have been a _martar_ to you I gave up
 everythingmy happy home in the country where all respected the
 name of Hoggarty my valuble furnitur and wines my plate glass and
 crockry I brought allall to make your home happy and rispectable I
 put up with the _airs and impertanencies_ of Mrs Titmarsh I loaded
 her and you with presents and bennafits I sacrafised myself I gave
 up the best sociaty in the land to witch I have been accustomed in
 order to be a gardian and compannion to you and prevent if possible
 that _waist and ixtravygance_ which I _prophycied_ would be your ruin
 Such waist and ixtravygance never never never did I see Buttar
 waisted as if it had been dirt coles flung away candles burnt _at
 both ends_ tea and meat the same The butchers bill in this house
 was enough to support six famalies

 And now you have the audassaty being placed in prison justly for
 your crimesfor cheating me of 3000_l_ for robbing your mother of
 an insignificient summ which to her poor thing was everything
 though she will not feel her loss as I do being all her life next
 door to a beggar for incurring detts which you cannot pay wherein
 you knew that your miserable income was quite unable to support your
 ixtravyganceyou come upon me to pay your detts No sir it is
 quite enough that your mother should go on the parish and that your
 wife should sweep the streets to which you have indeed brought them
 _I_ at least though cheated by you of a large summ and obliged to
 pass my days in comparative ruin can retire and have some of the
 comforts to which my rank entitles me The furnitur in this house is
 mine and as I presume you intend _your lady_ to sleep in the streets
 I give you warning that I shall remove it all tomorrow

 Mr Smithers will tell you that I had intended to leave you my intire
 fortune I have this morning in his presents solamly toar up my
 will and hereby renounce all connection with you and your beggarly
 family

 SUSAN HOGGARTY

 PSI took a viper into my bosom _and it stung me_

I confess that on the first reading of this letter I was in such a fury
that I forgot almost the painful situation in which it plunged me and
the ruin hanging over me

What a fool you were Titmarsh to write that letter said Mr
Smithers You have cut your own throat sirlost a fine
propertywritten yourself out of five hundred a year Mrs Hoggarty
my client brought the will as she says downstairs and flung it into
the fire before our faces

Its a blessing that your wife was from home added Gus She went to
church this morning with Dr Salts family and sent word that she would
spend the day with them She was always glad to be away from Mrs H
you know

She never knew on which side her bread was buttered said Mr Smithers
You should have taken the lady when she was in the humour sir and have
borrowed the money elsewhere Why sir I had almost reconciled her to
her loss in that cursed Company I showed her how I had saved out of
Broughs claws the whole of her remaining fortune which he would have
devoured in a day the scoundrel And if you would have left the matter
to me Mr Titmarsh I would have had you reconciled completely to Mrs
Hoggarty I would have removed all your difficulties I would have lent
you the pitiful sum of money myself

Will you says Gus thats a trump and he seized Smitherss hand
and squeezed it so that the tears came into the attorneys eyes

Generous fellow said I lend me money when you know what a situation
I am in and not able to pay

Ay my good sir theres the rub says Mr Smithers I said I _would_
have lent the money and so to the acknowledged heir of Mrs Hoggarty I
wouldwould at this moment for nothing delights the heart of Bob
Smithers more than to do a kindness I would have rejoiced in doing it
and a mere acknowledgment from that respected lady would have amply
sufficed But now sir the case is alteredyou have no security to
offer as you justly observe

Not a whit certainly

And without security sir of course can expect no moneyof course not
You are a man of the world Mr Titmarsh and I see our notions exactly
agree

Theres his wifes property says Gus

Wifes property Bah Mrs Sam Titmarsh is a minor and cant touch a
shilling of it No no no meddling with minors for me But stopyour
mother has a house and shop in our village Get me a mortgage of that

Ill do no such thing sir says I My mother has suffered quite
enough on my score already and has my sisters to provide for and I will
thank you Mr Smithers not to breathe a syllable to her regarding my
present situation

You speak like a man of honour sir says Mr Smithers and I will
obey your injunctions to the letter I will do more sir I will
introduce you to a respectable firm here my worthy friends Messrs
Higgs Biggs and Blatherwick who will do everything in their power to
serve you And so sir I wish you a very good morning

And with this Mr Smithers took his hat and left the room and after a
further consultation with my aunt as I heard afterwards quitted London
that evening by the mail

I sent my faithful Gus off once more to break the matter gently to my
wife fearing lest Mrs Hoggarty should speak of it abruptly to her as I
knew in her anger she would do But he came in an hour panting back to
say that Mrs H had packed and locked her trunks and had gone off in a
hackneycoach So knowing that my poor Mary was not to return till
night Hoskins remained with me till then and after a dismal day left
me once more at nine to carry the dismal tidings to her

At ten oclock on that night there was a great rattling and ringing at
the outer door and presently my poor girl fell into my arms and Gus
Hoskins sat blubbering in a corner as I tried my best to console her

    

The next morning I was favoured with a visit from Mr Blatherwick who
hearing from me that I had only three guineas in my pocket told me very
plainly that lawyers only lived by fees He recommended me to quit
Cursitor Street as living there was very expensive And as I was
sitting very sad my wife made her appearance it was with great
difficulty that she could be brought to leave me the night previous

The horrible men came at four this morning said she four hours
before light

What horrible men says I

Your aunts men said she to remove the furniture they had it all
packed before I came away And I let them carry all said she I was
too sad to look what was ours and what was not That odious Mr Wapshot
was with them and I left him seeing the last waggonload from the door
I have only brought away your clothes added she and a few of mine
and some of the books you used to like to read and somesome things I
have been getting for thefor the baby The servants wages were paid
up to Christmas and I paid them the rest And see just as I was going
away the post came and brought to me my halfyears income35_l_
dear Sam Isnt it a blessing

Will you pay my bill Mr Whatdyecallim here cried Mr Aminadab
flinging open the door he had been consulting with Mr Blatherwick I
suppose I want the room for _a gentleman_ I guess its too dear for
the like of you And herewill you believe itthe man handed me a
bill of three guineas for two days board and lodging in his odious
house

    

There was a crowd of idlers round the door as I passed out of it and had
I been alone I should have been ashamed of seeing them but as it was I
was only thinking of my dear dear wife who was leaning trustfully on my
arm and smiling like heaven into my faceay and _took_ heaven too
into the Fleet prison with meor an angel out of heaven Ah I had
loved her before and happy it is to love when one is hopeful and young
in the midst of smiles and sunshine but be _un_happy and then see what
it is to be loved by a good woman I declare before Heaven that of all
the joys and happy moments it has given me that was the crowning
onethat little ride with my wifes cheek on my shoulder down Holborn
to the prison Do you think I cared for the bailiff that sat opposite
No by the Lord I kissed her and hugged heryes and cried with her
likewise But before our ride was over her eyes dried up and she
stepped blushing and happy out of the coach at the prison door as if she
were a princess going to the Queens Drawingroom




CHAPTER XII


IN WHICH THE HEROS AUNTS DIAMOND MAKES ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HEROS
UNCLE

The failure of the great Diddlesex Association speedily became the theme
of all the newspapers and every person concerned in it was soon held up
to public abhorrence as a rascal and a swindler It was said that Brough
had gone off with a million of money Even it was hinted that poor I had
sent a hundred thousand pounds to America and only waited to pass
through the court in order to be a rich man for the rest of my days This
opinion had some supporters in the prison where strange to say it
procured me considerationof which as may be supposed I was little
inclined to avail myself Mr Aminadab however in his frequent visits
to the Fleet persisted in saying that I was a poorspirited creature a
mere tool in Broughs hands and had not saved a shilling Opinions
however differed and I believe it was considered by the turnkeys that I
was a fellow of exquisite dissimulation who had put on the appearance of
poverty in order more effectually to mislead the public

Messrs Abednego and Son were similarly held up to public odium and in
fact what were the exact dealings of these gentlemen with Mr Brough I
have never been able to learn It was proved by the books that large
sums of money had been paid to Mr Abednego by the Company but he
produced documents signed by Mr Brough which made the latter and the
West Diddlesex Association his debtors to a still further amount On the
day I went to the Bankruptcy Court to be examined Mr Abednego and the
two gentlemen from Houndsditch were present to swear to their debts and
made a sad noise and uttered a vast number of oaths in attestation of
their claim But Messrs Jackson and Paxton produced against them that
very Irish porter who was said to have been the cause of the fire and I
am told hinted that they had matter for hanging the Jewish gents if they
persisted in their demand On this they disappeared altogether and no
more was ever heard of their losses I am inclined to believe that our
Director had had money from Abednegohad given him shares as bonus and
securityhad been suddenly obliged to redeem these shares with ready
money and so had precipitated the ruin of himself and the concern It
is needless to say here in what a multiplicity of companies Brough was
engaged That in which poor Mr Tidd invested his money did not pay
2_d_ in the pound and that was the largest dividend paid by any of
them

As for oursah there was a pretty scene as I was brought from the Fleet
to the Bankruptcy Court to give my testimony as late head clerk and
accountant of the West Diddlesex Association

My poor wife then very near her time insisted upon accompanying me to
Basinghall Street and so did my friend Gus Hoskins that true and honest
fellow If you had seen the crowd that was assembled and the hubbub
that was made as I was brought up

Mr Titmarsh says the Commissioner as I came to the table with a
peculiar sarcastic accent on the TitMr Titmarsh you were the
confidant of Mr Brough the principal clerk of Mr Brough and a
considerable shareholder in the Company

Only a nominal one sir said I

Of course only nominal continued the Commissioner turning to his
colleague with a sneer and a great comfort it must be to you sir to
think that you had a share in all the plunthe profits of the
speculation and now can free yourself from the losses by saying you are
only a nominal shareholder

The infernal villain shouted out a voice from the crowd It was that
of the furious halfpay captain and late shareholder Captain Sparr

Silence in the court there the Commissioner continued and all this
while Mary was anxiously looking in his face and then in mine as pale
as death while Gus on the contrary was as red as vermilion Mr
Titmarsh I have had the good fortune to see a list of your debts from
the Insolvent Court and find that you are indebted to Mr Stiltz the
great tailor in a handsome sum to Mr Polonius the celebrated
jeweller likewise to fashionable milliners and dressmakers
moreoverand all this upon a salary of 200_l_ per annum For so young
a gentleman it must be confessed you have employed your time well

Has this anything to do with the question sir says I Am I here to
give an account of my private debts or to speak as to what I know
regarding the affairs of the Company As for my share in it I have a
mother sir and many sisters

The dd scoundrel shouts the Captain

Silence that there fellow shouts Gus as bold as brass at which the
court burst out laughing and this gave me courage to proceed

My mother sir four years since having a legacy of 400_l_ left to
her advised with her solicitor Mr Smithers how she should dispose of
this sum and as the Independent West Diddlesex was just then
established the money was placed in an annuity in that office where I
procured a clerkship You may suppose me a very hardened criminal
because I have ordered clothes of Mr Von Stiltz but you will hardly
fancy that I a lad of nineteen knew anything of the concerns of the
Company into whose service I entered as twentieth clerk my own mothers
money paying as it were for my place Well sir the interest offered
by the Company was so tempting that a rich relative of mine was induced
to purchase a number of shares

Who induced your relative if I may make so bold as to inquire

I cant help owning sir says I blushing that I wrote a letter
myself But consider my relative was sixty years old and I was twenty
one My relative took several months to consider and had the advice of
her lawyers before she acceded to my request And I made it at the
instigation of Mr Brough who dictated the letter which I wrote and who
I really thought then was as rich as Mr Rothschild himself

Your friend placed her money in your name and you if I mistake not
Mr Titmarsh were suddenly placed over the heads of twelve of your
fellowclerks as a reward for your service in obtaining it

It is very true sirand as I confessed it poor Mary began to wipe
her eyes and Guss ears I could not see his face looked like two red
hot muffinsits quite true sir and as matters have turned out I am
heartily sorry for what I did But at the time I thought I could serve
my aunt as well as myself and you must remember then how high our
shares were

Well sir having procured this sum of money you were straightway taken
into Mr Broughs confidence You were received into his house and from
third clerk speedily became head clerk in which post you were found at
the disappearance of your worthy patron

Sir you have no right to question me to be sure but here are a
hundred of our shareholders and Im not unwilling to make a clean breast
of it said I pressing Marys hand I certainly was the head clerk
And why Because the other gents left the office I certainly was
received into Mr Broughs house And why Because sir my aunt _had
more money to lay out_ I see it all clearly now though I could not
understand it then and the proof that Mr Brough wanted my aunts money
and not me is that when she came to town our Director carried her by
force out of my house to Fulham and never so much as thought of asking
me or my wife thither Ay sir and he would have had her remaining
money had not her lawyer from the country prevented her disposing of it
Before the concern finally broke and as soon as she heard there was
doubt concerning it she took back her sharesscrip shares they were
sir as you knowand has disposed of them as she thought fit Here
sir and gents says I you have the whole of the history as far as
regards me In order to get her only son a means of livelihood my
mother placed her little money with the Companyit is lost My aunt
invested larger sums with it which were to have been mine one day and
they are lost too and here am I at the end of four years a disgraced
and ruined man Is there anyone present however much he has suffered by
the failure of the Company that has had worse fortune through it than
I

Mr Titmarsh says Mr Commissioner in a much more friendly way and
at the same time casting a glance at a newspaper reporter that was
sitting hard by your story is not likely to get into the newspapers
for as you say it is a private affair which you had no need to speak
of unless you thought proper and may be considered as a confidential
conversation between us and the other gentlemen here But if it _could_
be made public it might do some good and warn people if they _will_ be
warned against the folly of such enterprises as that in which you have
been engaged It is quite clear from your story that you have been
deceived as grossly as anyone of the persons present But look you sir
if you had not been so eager after gain I think you would not have
allowed yourself to be deceived and would have kept your relatives
money and inherited it according to your story one day or other
Directly people expect to make a large interest their judgment seems to
desert them and because they wish for profit they think they are sure
of it and disregard all warnings and all prudence Besides the hundreds
of honest families who have been ruined by merely placing confidence in
this Association of yours and who deserve the heartiest pity there are
hundreds more who have embarked in it like yourself not for investment
but for speculation and these upon my word deserve the fate they have
met with As long as dividends are paid no questions are asked and Mr
Brough might have taken the money for his shareholders on the highroad
and they would have pocketed it and not been too curious But whats
the use of talking says Mr Commissioner in a passion here is one
rogue detected and a thousand dupes made and if another swindler starts
tomorrow there will be a thousand more of his victims round this table
a year hence and so I suppose to the end And now lets go to
business gentlemen and excuse this sermon

After giving an account of all I knew which was very little other gents
who were employed in the concern were examined and I went back to
prison with my poor little wife on my arm We had to pass through the
crowd in the rooms and my heart bled as I saw amongst a score of
others poor Gates Broughs porter who had advanced every shilling to
his master and was now with ten children houseless and penniless in
his old age Captain Sparr was in this neighbourhood but by no means so
friendly disposed for while Gates touched his hat as if I had been a
lord the little Captain came forward threatening with his bamboocane
and swearing with great oaths that I was an accomplice of Brough Curse
you for a smoothfaced scoundrel says he What business have you to
ruin an English gentleman as you have me And again he advanced with
his stick But this time officer as he was Gus took him by the collar
and shoved him back and said Look at the lady you brute and hold
your tongue And when he looked at my wifes situation Captain Sparr
became redder for shame than he had before been for anger Im sorry
shes married to such a goodfornothing muttered he and fell back
and my poor wife and I walked out of the court and back to our dismal
room in the prison

It was a hard place for a gentle creature like her to be confined in and
I longed to have some of my relatives with her when her time should come
But her grandmother could not leave the old lieutenant and my mother had
written to say that as Mrs Hoggarty was with us she was quite as well
at home with her children What a blessing it is for you under your
misfortunes continued the good soul to have the generous purse of
your aunt for succour Generous purse of my aunt indeed Where could
Mrs Hoggarty be It was evident that she had not written to any of her
friends in the country nor gone thither as she threatened

But as my mother had already lost so much money through my unfortunate
luck and as she had enough to do with her little pittance to keep my
sisters at home and as on hearing of my condition she would infallibly
have sold her last gown to bring me aid Mary and I agreed that we would
not let her know what our real condition wasbad enough Heaven knows
and sad and cheerless Old Lieutenant Smith had likewise nothing but his
halfpay and his rheumatism so we were in fact quite friendless

That period of my life and that horrible prison seem to me like
recollections of some fever What an awful placenot for the sadness
strangely enough as I thought but for the gaiety of it for the long
prison galleries were I remember full of life and a sort of grave
bustle All day and all night doors were clapping to and fro and you
heard loud voices oaths footsteps and laughter Next door to our room
was one where a man sold gin under the name of _tape_ and here from
morning till night the people kept up a horrible revelryand sangsad
songs some of them but my dear little girl was thank God unable to
understand the most part of their ribaldry She never used to go out
till nightfall and all day she sat working at a little store of caps and
dresses for the expected strangerand not she says to this day
unhappy But the confinement sickened her who had been used to happy
country air and she grew daily paler and paler

The Fives Court was opposite our window and here I used very
unwillingly at first but afterwards I do confess with much eagerness
to take a couple of hours daily sport Ah it was a strange place
There was an aristocracy there as elsewhereamongst other gents a son
of my Lord Deuceace and many of the men in the prison were as eager to
walk with him and talked of his family as knowingly as if they were
Bond Street bucks Poor Tidd especially was one of these Of all his
fortune he had nothing left but a dressingcase and a flowered dressing
gown and to these possessions he added a fine pair of moustaches with
which the poor creature strutted about and though cursing his ill
fortune was I do believe as happy whenever his friends brought him a
guinea as he had been during his brief career as a gentleman on town I
have seen sauntering dandies in wateringplaces ogling the women
watching eagerly for steamboats and stagecoaches as if their lives
depended upon them and strutting all day in jackets up and down the
public walks Well there are such fellows in prison quite as dandified
and foolish only a little more shabbydandies with dirty beards and
holes at their elbows

I did not go near what is called the poor side of the prisonI _dared_
not that was the fact But our little stock of money was running low
and my heart sickened to think what might be my dear wifes fate and on
what sort of a couch our child might be born But Heaven spared me that
pangHeaven and my dear good friend Gus Hoskins

The attorneys to whom Mr Smithers recommended me told me that I could
get leave to live in the rules of the Fleet could I procure sureties to
the marshal of the prison for the amount of the detainer lodged against
me but though I looked Mr Blatherwick hard in the face he never
offered to give the bail for me and I knew no housekeeper in London who
would procure it There was however one whom I did not knowand that
was old Mr Hoskins the leatherseller of Skinner Street a kind fat
gentleman who brought his fat wife to see Mrs Titmarsh and though the
lady gave herself rather patronising airs her husband being free of the
Skinners Company and bidding fair to be Alderman nay Lord Mayor of
the first city in the world she seemed heartily to sympathise with us
and her husband stirred and bustled about until the requisite leave was
obtained and I was allowed comparative liberty

As for lodgings they were soon had My old landlady Mrs Stokes sent
her Jemima to say that her first floor was at our service and when we
had taken possession of it and I offered at the end of the week to pay
her bill the good soul with tears in her eyes told me that she did not
want for money now and that she knew I had enough to do with what I had
I did not refuse her kindness for indeed I had but five guineas left
and ought not by rights to have thought of such expensive apartments as
hers but my wifes time was very near and I could not bear to think
that she should want for any comfort in her lyingin

The admirable woman with whom the Misses Hoskins came every day to keep
companyand very nice kind ladies they arerecovered her health a good
deal now she was out of the odious prison and was enabled to take
exercise How gaily did we pace up and down Bridge Street and Chatham
Place to be sure and yet in truth I was a beggar and felt sometimes
ashamed of being so happy

With regard to the liabilities of the Company my mind was now made quite
easy for the creditors could only come upon our directors and these it
was rather difficult to find Mr Brough was across the water and I
must say to the credit of that gentleman that while everybody thought
he had run away with hundreds of thousands of pounds he was in a garret
at Boulogne with scarce a shilling in his pocket and his fortune to
make afresh Mrs Brough like a good brave woman remained faithful to
him and only left Fulham with the gown on her back and Miss Belinda
though grumbling and sadly out of temper was no better off For the
other directorswhen they came to inquire at Edinburgh for Mr Mull W
S it appeared there _was_ a gentleman of that name who had practised
in Edinburgh with good reputation until 1800 since when he had retired
to the Isle of Skye and on being applied to knew no more of the West
Diddlesex Association than Queen Anne did General Sir Dionysius
OHalloran had abruptly quitted Dublin and returned to the republic of
Guatemala Mr Shirk went into the _Gazette_ Mr Macraw MP and
Kings Counsel had not a single guinea in the world but what he received
for attending our board and the only man seizable was Mr Manstraw a
wealthy navy contractor as we understood at Chatham He turned out to
be a small dealer in marine stores and his whole stock in trade was not
worth 10_l_ Mr Abednego was the other director and we have already
seen what became of _him_

Why as there is no danger from the West Diddlesex suggested Mr
Hoskins senior should you not now endeavour to make an arrangement
with your creditors and who can make a better bargain with them than
pretty Mrs Titmarsh here whose sweet eyes would soften the
hardesthearted tailor or milliner that ever lived

Accordingly my dear girl one bright day in February shook me by the
hand and bidding me be of good cheer set forth with Gus in a coach to
pay a visit to those persons Little did I think a year before that the
daughter of the gallant Smith should ever be compelled to be a suppliant
to tailors and haberdashers but _she_ Heaven bless her felt none of
the shame which oppressed meor _said_ she felt noneand went away
nothing doubting on her errand

In the evening she came back and my heart thumped to know the news I
saw it was bad by her face For some time she did not speak but looked
as pale as death and wept as she kissed me _You_ speak Mr
Augustus at last said she sobbing and so Gus told me the
circumstances of that dismal day

What do you think Sam says he that infernal aunt of yours at whose
command you had the things has written to the tradesmen to say that you
are a swindler and impostor that you give out that _she_ ordered the
goods that she is ready to drop down dead and to take her bibleoath
she never did any such thing and that they must look to you alone for
payment Not one of them would hear of letting you out and as for
Mantalini the scoundrel was so insolent that I gave him a box on the
ear and would have halfkilled him only poor MaryMrs Titmarsh I
meanscreamed and fainted and I brought her away and here she is as
ill as can be

That night the indefatigable Gus was obliged to run posthaste for
Doctor Salts and next morning a little boy was born I did not know
whether to be sad or happy as they showed me the little weakly thing
but Mary was the happiest woman she declared in the world and forgot
all her sorrows in nursing the poor baby she went bravely through her
time and vowed that it was the loveliest child in the world and that
though Lady Tiptoff whose confinement we read of as having taken place
the same day might have a silk bed and a fine house in Grosvenor Square
she never never could have such a beautiful child as our dear little Gus
for after whom should we have named the boy if not after our good kind
friend We had a little party at the christening and I assure you were
very merry over our tea

The mother thank Heaven was very well and it did ones heart good to
see her in that attitude in which I think every woman be she ever so
plain looks beautifulwith her baby at her bosom The child was
sickly but she did not see it we were very poor but what cared she
She had no leisure to be sorrowful as I was I had my last guinea now in
my pocket and when _that_ was goneah my heart sickened to think of
what was to come and I prayed for strength and guidance and in the
midst of my perplexities felt yet thankful that the danger of the
confinement was over and that for the worst fortune which was to befall
us my dear wife was at least prepared and strong in health

I told Mrs Stokes that she must let us have a cheaper rooma garret
that should cost but a few shillings and though the good woman bade me
remain in the apartments we occupied yet now that my wife was well I
felt it would be a crime to deprive my kind landlady of her chief means
of livelihood and at length she promised to get me a garret as I wanted
and to make it as comfortable as might be and little Jemima declared
that she would be glad beyond measure to wait on the mother and the
child

The room then was made ready and though I took some pains not to speak
of the arrangement too suddenly to Mary yet there was no need of
disguise or hesitation for when at last I told herIs that all said
she and took my hand with one of her blessed smiles and vowed that she
and Jemima would keep the room as pretty and neat as possible And I
will cook your dinners added she for you know you said I make the
best rolypoly puddings in the world God bless her I do think some
women almost love poverty but I did not tell Mary how poor I was nor
had she any idea how lawyers and prisons and doctors fees had
diminished the sum of money which she brought me when we came to the
Fleet

It was not however destined that she and her child should inhabit that
little garret We were to leave our lodgings on Monday morning but on
Saturday evening the child was seized with convulsions and all Sunday
the mother watched and prayed for it but it pleased God to take the
innocent infant from us and on Sunday at midnight it lay a corpse in
its mothers bosom Amen We have other children happy and well now
round about us and from the fathers heart the memory of this little
thing has almost faded but I do believe that every day of her life the
mother thinks of the firstborn that was with her for so short a while
many and many a time has she taken her daughters to the grave in Saint
Brides where he lies buried and she wears still at her neck a little
little lock of gold hair which she took from the head of the infant as
he lay smiling in his coffin It has happened to me to forget the
childs birthday but to her never and often in the midst of common talk
comes something that shows she is thinking of the child stillsome
simple allusion that is to me inexpressibly affecting

I shall not try to describe her grief for such things are sacred and
secret and a man has no business to place them on paper for all the
world to read Nor should I have mentioned the childs loss at all but
that even that loss was the means of a great worldly blessing to us as
my wife has often with tears and thanks acknowledged

While my wife was weeping over her child I am ashamed to say I was
distracted with other feelings besides those of grief for its loss and I
have often since thought what a masternay destroyerof the affections
want is and have learned from experience to be thankful for _daily
bread_ That acknowledgment of weakness which we make in imploring to be
relieved from hunger and from temptation is surely wisely put in our
daily prayer Think of it you who are rich and take heed how you turn a
beggar away

The child lay there in its wicker cradle with its sweet fixed smile in
its face I think the angels in heaven must have been glad to welcome
that pretty innocent smile and it was only the next day after my wife
had gone to lie down and I sat keeping watch by it that I remembered
the condition of its parents and thought I cant tell with what a pang
that I had not money left to bury the little thing and wept bitter tears
of despair Now at last I thought I must apply to my poor mother for
this was a sacred necessity and I took paper and wrote her a letter at
the babys side and told her of our condition But thank Heaven I
never sent the letter for as I went to the desk to get sealingwax and
seal that dismal letter my eyes fell upon the diamond pin that I had
quite forgotten and that was lying in the drawer of the desk

I looked into the bedroommy poor wife was asleep she had been
watching for three nights and days and had fallen asleep from sheer
fatigue and I ran out to a pawnbrokers with the diamond and received
seven guineas for it and coming back put the money into the landladys
hand and told her to get what was needful My wife was still asleep
when I came back and when she woke we persuaded her to go downstairs to
the landladys parlour and meanwhile the necessary preparations were
made and the poor child consigned to its coffin

The next day after all was over Mrs Stokes gave me back three out of
the seven guineas and then I could not help sobbing out to her my doubts
and wretchedness telling her that this was the last money I had and
when that was gone I knew not what was to become of the best wife that
ever a man was blest with

My wife was downstairs with the woman Poor Gus who was with me and
quite as much affected as any of the party took me by the arm and led
me downstairs and we quite forgot all about the prison and the rules
and walked a long long way across Blackfriars Bridge the kind fellow
striving as much as possible to console me

When we came back it was in the evening The first person who met me in
the house was my kind mother who fell into my arms with many tears and
who rebuked me tenderly for not having told her of my necessities She
never should have known of them she said but she had not heard from me
since I wrote announcing the birth of the child and she felt uneasy
about my silence and meeting Mr Smithers in the street asked from him
news concerning me whereupon that gentleman with some little show of
alarm told her that he thought her daughterinlaw was confined in an
uncomfortable place that Mrs Hoggarty had left us finally that I was
in prison This news at once despatched my poor mother on her travels
and she had only just come from the prison where she learned my address

I asked her whether she had seen my wife and how she found her Rather
to my amaze she said that Mary was out with the landlady when she
arrived and eightnine oclock came and she was absent still

At ten oclock returnednot my wife but Mrs Stokes and with her a
gentleman who shook hands with me on coming into the room and said
Mr Titmarsh I dont know whether you will remember me my name is
Tiptoff I have brought you a note from Mrs Titmarsh and a message
from my wife who sincerely commiserates your loss and begs you will not
be uneasy at Mrs Titmarshs absence She has been good enough to
promise to pass the night with Lady Tiptoff and I am sure you will not
object to her being away from you while she is giving happiness to a
sick mother and a sick child After a few more words my Lord left us
My wifes note only said that Mrs Stokes would tell me all




CHAPTER XIII


IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT A GOOD WIFE IS THE BEST DIAMOND A MAN CAN WEAR
IN HIS BOSOM

Mrs Titmarsh maam says Mrs Stokes before I gratify your
curiosity maam permit me to observe that angels is scarce and its
rare to have one much more two in a family Both your son and your
daughterinlaw maam are of that uncommon sort they are now reely
maam

My mother said she thanked God for both of us and Mrs Stokes
proceeded

When the fu when the seminary maam was concluded this morning
your poor daughterinlaw was glad to take shelter in my humble parlour
maam where she wept and told a thousand stories of the little cherub
thats gone Heaven bless us it was here but a month and no one could
have thought it could have done such a many things in that time But a
mothers eyes are clear maam and I had just such another angel my
dear little Antony that was born before Jemima and would have been
twentythree now were he in this wicked world maam However I wont
speak of him maam but of what took place

You must know maam that Mrs Titmarsh remained downstairs while Mr
Samuel was talking with his friend Mr Hoskins and the poor thing would
not touch a bit of dinner though we had it made comfortable and after
dinner it was with difficulty I could get her to sup a little drop of
wineandwater and dip a toast in it It was the first morsel that had
passed her lips for many a long hour maam

Well she would not speak and I thought it best not to interrupt her
but she sat and looked at my two youngest that were playing on the rug
and just as Mr Titmarsh and his friend Gus went out the boy brought the
newspaper maamit always comes from three to four and I began
areading of it But I couldnt read much for thinking of poor Mr
Sams sad face as he went out and the sad story he told me about his
money being so low and every now and then I stopped reading and bade
Mrs T not to take on so and told her some stories about my dear little
Antony

Ah says she sobbing and looking at the young ones you have other
children Mrs Stokes but thatthat was my only one and she flung
back in her chair and cried fit to break her heart and I knew that the
cry would do her good and so went back to my paperthe _Morning Post_
maam I always read it for I like to know whats agoing on in the West
End

The very first thing that my eyes lighted upon was thisWanted
immediately a respectable person as wetnurse Apply at No 
Grosvenor Square Bless us and save us says I heres poor Lady
Tiptoff ill for I knew her Ladyships address and how she was confined
on the very same day with Mrs T and for the matter of that her
Ladyship knows my address having visited here

A sudden thought came over me My dear Mrs Titmarsh said I you
know how poor and how good your husband is

Yes says she rather surprised

Well my dear says I looking her hard in the face Lady Tiptoff
who knows him wants a nurse for her son Lord Poynings Will you be a
brave woman and look for the place and mayhap replace the little one
that God has taken from you

She began to tremble and blush and then I told her what you Mr Sam
had told me the other day about your money matters and no sooner did she
hear it than she sprung to her bonnet and said Come come and in
five minutes she had me by the arm and we walked together to Grosvenor
Square The air did her no harm Mr Sam and during the whole of the
walk she never cried but once and then it was at seeing a nurserymaid
in the Square

A great fellow in livery opens the door and says Youre the forty
fifth as come about this ere place but fust let me ask you a
preliminary question Are you a Hirishwoman

No sir says Mrs T

That suffishnt mem says the gentleman in plush I see youre not by
your axnt Step this way ladies if you please Youll find some more
candidix for the place upstairs but I sent away fortyfour happlicants
because they _was_ Hirish

We were taken upstairs over very soft carpets and brought into a room
and told by an old lady who was there to speak very softly for my Lady
was only two rooms off And when I asked how the baby and her Ladyship
were the old lady told me both were pretty well only the doctor said
Lady Tiptoff was too delicate to nurse any longer and so it was
considered necessary to have a wetnurse

There was another young woman in the rooma tall fine woman as ever you
sawthat looked very angry and contempshious at Mrs T and me and
said Ive brought a letter from the duchess whose daughter I nust and
I think Mrs Blenkinsop mem my Lady Tiptoff may look far before she
finds such another nuss as me Five feet six high had the smallpox
married to a corporal in the Lifeguards perfectly healthy best of
charactiers only drink water and as for the child maam if her
Ladyship had six Ive a plenty for them all

As the woman was making this speech a little gentleman in black came in
from the next room treading as if on velvet The woman got up and made
him a low curtsey and folding her arms on her great broad chest
repeated the speech she had made before Mrs T did not get up from her
chair but only made a sort of a bow which to be sure I thought was
ill manners as this gentleman was evidently the apothecary He looked
hard at her and said Well my good woman and are you come about the
place too

Yes sir says she blushing

You seem very delicate How old is your child How many have you had
What character have you

Your wife didnt answer a word so I stepped up and said Sir says
I this lady has just lost her first child and isnt used to look for
places being the daughter of a captain in the navy so youll excuse her
want of manners in not getting up when you came in

The doctor at this sat down and began talking very kindly to her he
said he was afraid that her application would be unsuccessful as Mrs
Horner came very strongly recommended from the Duchess of Doncaster
whose relative Lady Tiptoff was and presently my Lady appeared looking
very pretty maam in an elegant lacecap and a sweet muslin _robede
sham_

A nurse came out of her Ladyships room with her and while my Lady was
talking to us walked up and down in the next room with something in her
arms

First my Lady spoke to Mrs Horner and then to Mrs T but all the
while she was talking Mrs Titmarsh rather rudely as I thought maam
was looking into the next room lookinglooking at the baby there with
all her might My Lady asked her her name and if she had any character
and as she did not speak I spoke up for her and said she was the wife
of one of the best men in the world that her Ladyship knew the
gentleman too and had brought him a haunch of venison Then Lady
Tiptoff looked up quite astonished and I told the whole story how you
had been head clerk and that rascal Brough had brought you to ruin
Poor thing said my Lady Mrs Titmarsh did not speak but still kept
looking at the baby and the great big grenadier of a Mrs Horner looked
angrily at her

Poor thing says my Lady taking Mrs Ts hand very kind she seems
very young How old are you my dear

Five weeks and two days says your wife sobbing

Mrs Horner burst into a laugh but there was a tear in my Ladys eyes
for she knew what the poor thing was athinking of

Silence woman says she angrily to the great grenadier woman and at
this moment the child in the next room began crying

As soon as your wife heard the noise she sprung from her chair and made
a stop forward and put both her hands to her breast and said The
childthe childgive it me and then began to cry again

My Lady looked at her for a moment and then ran into the next room and
brought her the baby and the baby clung to her as if he knew her and a
pretty sight it was to see that dear woman with the child at her bosom

When my Lady saw it what do you think she did After looking on it for
a bit she put her arms round your wifes neck and kissed her

My dear said she I am sure you are as good as you are pretty and
you shall keep the child and I thank God for sending you to me

These were her very words and Dr Bland who was standing by says
Its a second judgment of Solomon

I suppose my Lady you dont want _me_ says the big woman with
another curtsey

Not in the least answers my Lady haughtily and the grenadier left
the room and then I told all your story at full length and Mrs
Blenkinsop kept me to tea and I saw the beautiful room that Mrs
Titmarsh is to have next to Lady Tiptoffs and when my Lord came home
what does he do but insist upon coming back with me here in a hackney
coach as he said he must apologise to you for keeping your wife away

I could not help in my own mind connecting this strange event which in
the midst of our sorrow came to console us and in our poverty to give
us breadI could not help connecting it with the _diamond pin_ and
fancying that the disappearance of that ornament had somehow brought a
different and a better sort of luck into my family And though some
gents who read this may call me a poorspirited fellow for allowing my
wife to go out to service who was bred a lady and ought to have servants
herself yet for my part I confess I did not feel one minutes scruple
or mortification on the subject If you love a person is it not a
pleasure to feel obliged to him And this in consequence I felt I
was proud and happy at being able to think that my dear wife should be
able to labour and earn bread for me now misfortune had put it out of my
power to support me and her And now instead of making any reflections
of my own upon prison discipline I will recommend the reader to consult
that admirable chapter in the Life of Mr Pickwick in which the same
theme is handled and which shows how silly it is to deprive honest men
of the means of labour just at the moment when they most want it What
could I do There were one or two gents in the prison who could work
literary gentsone wrote his Travels in Mesopotamia and the other
his Sketches at Almacks in the place but all the occupation I could
find was walking down Bridge Street and then up Bridge Street and
staring at Alderman Waithmans windows and then at the black man who
swept the crossing I never gave him anything but I envied him his
trade and his broom and the money that continually fell into his old
hat But I was not allowed even to carry a broom

Twice or thricefor Lady Tiptoff did not wish her little boy often to
breathe the air of such a close place as Salisbury Squaremy dear Mary
came in the thundering carriage to see me They were merry meetings
andif the truth must be toldtwice when nobody was by I jumped into
the carriage and had a drive with her and when I had seen her home
jumped into another hackneycoach and drove back But this was only
twice for the system was dangerous and it might bring me into trouble
and it cost three shillings from Grosvenor Square to Ludgate Hill

Here meanwhile my good mother kept me company and what should we read
of one day but the marriage of Mrs Hoggarty and the Rev Grimes Wapshot
My mother who never loved Mrs H now said that she should repent all
her life having allowed me to spend so much of my time with that odious
ungrateful woman and added that she and I too were justly punished for
worshipping the mammon of unrighteousness and forgetting our natural
feelings for the sake of my aunts paltry lucre Well Amen said I
This is the end of all our fine schemes My aunts money and my aunts
diamond were the causes of my ruin and now they are clear gone thank
Heaven and I hope the old lady will be happy and I must say I dont
envy the Rev Grimes Wapshot So we put Mrs Hoggarty out of our
thoughts and made ourselves as comfortable as might be

Rich and great people are slower in making Christians of their children
than we poor ones and little Lord Poynings was not christened until the
month of June A duke was one godfather and Mr Edmund Preston the
State Secretary another and that kind Lady Jane Preston whom I have
before spoken of was the godmother to her nephew She had not long been
made acquainted with my wifes history and both she and her sister loved
her heartily and were very kind to her Indeed there was not a single
soul in the house high or low but was fond of that good sweet creature
and the very footmen were as ready to serve her as they were their own
mistress

I tell you what sir says one of them You see Tit my boy Im a
connyshure and up to snough and if ever I see a lady in my life Mrs
Titmarsh is one I cant be fimiliar with herIve tried

Have you sir said I

Dont look so indignant I cant I say be fimiliar with her as I am
with you Theres a somethink in her a jennysquaw that haws me sir
and even my Lords own man that as ad as much success as any gentleman
in Europehe says that cuss him

Mr Charles says I tell my Lords own man that if he wants to keep
his place and his whole skin he will never address a single word to that
lady but such as a servant should utter in the presence of his mistress
and take notice that I am a gentleman though a poor one and will murder
the first man who does her wrong

Mr Charles only said Gammin to this but psha in bragging about my
own spirit I forgot to say what great good fortune my dear wifes
conduct procured for me

On the christeningday Mr Preston offered her first a five and then a
twentypound note but she declined either but she did not decline a
present that the two ladies made her together and this was no other than
_my release from the Fleet_ Lord Tiptoffs lawyer paid every one of the
bills against me and that happy christeningday made me a free man Ah
who shall tell the pleasure of that day or the merry dinner we had in
Marys room at Lord Tiptoffs house when my Lord and my Lady came
upstairs to shake hands with me

I have been speaking to Mr Preston says my Lord the gentleman with
whom you had the memorable quarrel and he has forgiven it although he
was in the wrong and promises to do something for you We are going
down meanwhile to his house at Richmond and be sure Mr Titmarsh I
will not fail to keep you in his mind

_Mrs_ Titmarsh will do that says my Lady for Edmund is woefully
smitten with her And Mary blushed and I laughed and we were all very
happy and sure enough there came from Richmond a letter to me stating
that I was appointed fourth clerk in the Tape and Sealingwax Office
with a salary of 80_l_ per annum

Here perhaps my story ought to stop for I was happy at last and have
never since thank Heaven known want but Gus insists that I should add
how I gave up the place in the Tape and Sealingwax Office and for what
reason That excellent Lady Jane Preston is long gone and so is Mr P
off in an apoplexy and there is no harm now in telling the story

The fact was that Mr Preston had fallen in love with Mary in a much
more serious way than any of us imagined for I do believe he invited his
brotherinlaw to Richmond for no other purpose than to pay court to his
sons nurse And one day as I was coming posthaste to thank him for
the place he had procured for me being directed by Mr Charles to the
scrubbery as he called it which led down to the riverthere sure
enough I found Mr Preston on his knees too on the gravelwalk and
before him Mary holding the little lord

Dearest creature says Mr Preston do but listen to me and Ill make
your husband consul at Timbuctoo He shall never know of it I tell you
he _can_ never know of it I pledge you my word as a Cabinet Minister
Oh dont look at me in that arch way by heavens your eyes kill me

Mary when she saw me burst out laughing and ran down the lawn my Lord
making a huge crowing too and holding out his little fat hands Mr
Preston who was a heavy man was slowly getting up when catching a
sight of me looking as fierce as the crater of Mount Etnahe gave a
start back and lost his footing and rolled over and over walloping into
the water at the gardens edge It was not deep and he came bubbling
and snorting out again in as much fright as fury

You dd ungrateful villain says he what do you stand there laughing
for

Im waiting your orders for Timbuctoo sir says I and laughed fit to
die and so did my Lord Tiptoff and his party who joined us on the lawn
and Jeames the footman came forward and helped Mr Preston out of the
water

Oh you old sinner says my Lord as his brotherinlaw came up the
slope Will that heart of yours be always so susceptible you romantic
apoplectic immoral man

Mr Preston went away looking blue with rage and illtreated his wife
for a whole month afterwards

At any rate says my Lord Titmarsh here has got a place through our
friends unhappy attachment and Mrs Titmarsh has only laughed at him
so there is no harm there Its an ill wind that blows nobody good you
know

Such a wind as that my Lord with due respect to you shall never do
good to me I have learned in the past few years what it is to make
friends with the mammon of unrighteousness and that out of such
friendship no good comes in the end to honest men It shall never be
said that Sam Titmarsh got a place because a great man was in love with
his wife and were the situation ten times as valuable I should blush
every day I entered the officedoors in thinking of the base means by
which my fortune was made You have made me free my Lord and thank
God I am willing to work I can easily get a clerkship with the
assistance of my friends and with that and my wifes income we can
manage honestly to face the world

This rather long speech I made with some animation for look you I was
not over well pleased that his Lordship should think me capable of
speculating in any way on my wifes beauty

My Lord at first turned red and looked rather angry but at last he held
out his hand and said You are right Titmarsh and I am wrong and let
me tell you in confidence that I think you are a very honest fellow You
shant lose by your honesty I promise you

Nor did I for I am at this present moment Lord Tiptoffs steward and
righthand man and am I not a happy father and is not my wife loved and
respected by all the country and is not Gus Hoskins my brotherinlaw
partner with his excellent father in the leather way and the delight of
all his nephews and nieces for his tricks and fun

As for Mr Brough that gentlemans history would fill a volume of
itself Since he vanished from the London world he has become
celebrated on the Continent where he has acted a thousand parts and met
all sorts of changes of high and low fortune One thing we may at least
admire in the man and that is his undaunted courage and I cant help
thinking as I have said before that there must be some good in him
seeing the way in which his family are faithful to him With respect to
Roundhand I had best also speak tenderly The case of Roundhand v Tidd
is still in the memory of the public nor can I ever understand how Bill
Tidd so poetic as he was could ever take on with such a fat odious
vulgar woman as Mrs R who was old enough to be his mother

As soon as we were in prosperity Mr and Mrs Grimes Wapshot made
overtures to be reconciled to us and Mr Wapshot laid bare to me all the
baseness of Mr Smitherss conduct in the Brough transaction Smithers
had also endeavoured to pay his court to me once when I went down to
Somersetshire but I cut his pretensions short as I have shown He it
was said Mr Wapshot who induced Mrs Grimes Mrs Hoggarty she was
then to purchase the West Diddlesex shares receiving of course a
large bonus for himself But directly he found that Mrs Hoggarty had
fallen into the hands of Mr Brough and that he should lose the income
he made from the lawsuits with her tenants and from the management of her
landed property he determined to rescue her from that villain Brough
and came to town for the purpose He also added Mr Wapshot vented
his malignant slander against me but Heaven was pleased to frustrate his
base schemes In the proceedings consequent on Broughs bankruptcy Mr
Smithers could not appear for his own share in the transactions of the
Company would have been most certainly shown up During his absence from
London I became the husbandthe happy husbandof your aunt But
though my dear sir I have been the means of bringing her to grace I
cannot disguise from you that Mrs W has faults which all my pastoral
care has not enabled me to eradicate She is close of her money
sirvery close nor can I make that charitable use of her property
which as a clergyman I ought to do for she has tied up every shilling
of it and only allows me halfacrown a week for pocketmoney In
temper too she is very violent During the first years of our union I
strove with her yea I chastised her but her perseverance I must
confess got the better of me I make no more remonstrances but am as a
lamb in her hands and she leads me whithersoever she pleases

Mr Wapshot concluded his tale by borrowing halfacrown from me it was
at the Somerset Coffeehouse in the Strand where he came in the year
1832 to wait upon me and I saw him go from thence into the ginshop
opposite and come out of the ginshop halfanhour afterwards reeling
across the streets and perfectly intoxicated

He died next year when his widow who called herself Mrs
HoggartyGrimesWapshot of Castle Hoggarty said that over the grave of
her saint all earthly resentments were forgotten and proposed to come
and live with us paying us of course a handsome remuneration But
this offer my wife and I respectfully declined and once more she altered
her will which once more she had made in our favour called us
ungrateful wretches and pampered menials and left all her property to
the Irish Hoggarties But seeing my wife one day in a carriage with Lady
Tiptoff and hearing that we had been at the great ball at Tiptoff
Castle and that I had grown to be a rich man she changed her mind
again sent for me on her deathbed and left me the farms of Slopperton
and Squashtail with all her savings for fifteen years Peace be to her
soul for certainly she left me a very pretty property

Though I am no literary man myself my cousin Michael who generally
when he is short of coin comes down and passes a few months with us
says that my Memoirs may be of some use to the public meaning I
suspect to himself and if so I am glad to serve him and them and
hereby take farewell bidding all gents who peruse this to be cautious
of their money if they have it to be still more cautious of their
friends money to remember that great profits imply great risks and
that the great shrewd capitalists of this country would not be content
with four per cent for their money if they could securely get more
above all I entreat them never to embark in any speculation of which
the conduct is not perfectly clear to them and of which the agents are
not perfectly open and loyal

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergorgfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
