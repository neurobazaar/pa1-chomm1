ACT I

 The SCENE is the pretty drawingroom of a flat There are two
 doors one open into the hall the other shut and curtained
 Through a large bay window the curtains of which are not yet
 drawn the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a
 summer sunset a grand piano stands across one corner The
 manservant PAYNTER cleanshaven and discreet is arranging two
 tables for Bridge

 BURNEY the maid a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian
 faces only met with in England comes in through the curtained
 door which she leaves open disclosing the glimpse of a white
 wall PAYNTER looks up at her she shakes her head with an
 expression of concern

PAYNTER Wheres she gone

BURNEY Just walks about I fancy

PAYNTER She and the Governor dont hit it One of these days
shell flityoull see I like hershes a lady but these
thoroughbred unsits their skin and their mouths Theyll go till
they drop if they like the job and if they dont its nothing but
jibjibjib How was it down there before she married him

BURNEY Oh Quiet of course

PAYNTER Country homesI know em Whats her father the old
Rector like

BURNEY Oh very steady old man The mother dead long before I took
the place

PAYNTER Not a penny I suppose

BURNEY Shaking her head No and seven of them

PAYNTER At sound of the hall door The Governor

 BURNEY withdraws through the curtained door

 GEORGE DEDMOND enters from the hall He is in evening dress
 opera hat and overcoat his face is broad comely glossily
 shaved but with neat moustaches His eyes clear small and
 bluegrey have little speculation His hair is well brushed

GEORGE Handing PAYNTER his coat and hat Look here Paynter
When I send up from the Club for my dress things always put in a
black waistcoat as well

PAYNTER I asked the mistress sir

GEORGE In futuresee

PAYNTER Yes sir Signing towards the window Shall I leave the
sunset sir

 But GEORGE has crossed to the curtained door he opens it and
 says Clare Receiving no answer he goes in PAYNTER
 switches up the electric light His face turned towards the
 curtained door is apprehensive

GEORGE Reentering Wheres Mrs Dedmond

PAYNTER I hardly know sir

GEORGE Dined in

PAYNTER She had a mere nothing at seven sir

GEORGE Has she gone out since

PAYNTER Yes sirthat is yes Theermistress was not dressed
at all A little matter of fresh air I think sir

GEORGE What time did my mother say theyd be here for Bridge

PAYNTER Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at halfpast nine
and Captain Huntingdon tooMr and Mrs Fullarton might be a bit
late sir

GEORGE Its that now Your mistress said nothing

PAYNTER Not to me sir

GEORGE Send Burney

PAYNTER Very good sir He withdraws

 GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables BURNEY comes in
 front the hall

GEORGE Did your mistress say anything before she went out

BURNEY Yes sir

GEORGE Well

BURNEY I dont think she meant it sir

GEORGE I dont want to know what you dont think I want the fact

BURNEY Yes sir The mistress said I hope itll be a pleasant
evening Burney

GEORGE OhThanks

BURNEY Ive put out the mistresss things sir

GEORGE Ah

BURNEY Thank you sir She withdraws

GEORGE Damn

 He again goes to the curtained door and passes through
 PAYNTER coming in from the hall announces General Sir
 Charles and Lady Dedmond SIR CHARLES is an upright
 wellgroomed greymoustached redfaced man of sixtyseven with
 a keen eye for molehills and none at all for mountains LADY
 DEDMOND has a firm thin face full of capability and decision
 not without kindliness and faintly weathered as if she had
 faced many situations in many parts of the world She is fifty
 five

 PAYNTER withdraws

SIR CHARLES Hullo Where are they Hm

 As he speaks GEORGE reenters

LADY DEDMOND Kissing her son Well George Wheres Clare

GEORGE Afraid shes late

LADY DEDMOND Are we early

GEORGE As a matter of fact shes not in

LADY DEDMOND Oh

SIR CHARLES Hm Notnot had a rumpus

GEORGE Not particularly With the first real sign of feeling
What I cant stand is being made a fool of before other people
Ordinary friction one can put up with But that

SIR CHARLES Gone out on purpose What

LADY DEDMOND What was the trouble

GEORGE I told her this morning you were coming in to Bridge
Appears shed asked that fellow Malise for music

LADY DEDMOND Without letting you know

GEORGE I believe she did tell me

LADY DEDMOND But surely

GEORGE I dont want to discuss it Theres never anything in
particular Were all anyhow as you know

LADY DEDMOND I see She looks shrewdly at her son My dear
I should be rather careful about him I think

SIR CHARLES Whos that

LADY DEDMOND That Mr Malise

SIR CHARLES Oh That chap

GEORGE Clare isnt that sort

LADY DEDMOND I know But she catches up notions very easily I
think its a great pity you ever came across him

SIR CHARLES Where did you pick him up

GEORGE Italythis Springsome place or other where they couldnt
speak English

SIR CHARLES Um Thats the worst of travellin

LADY DEDMOND I think you ought to have dropped him These literary
peopleQuietly From exchanging ideas to something else isnt
very far George

SIR CHARLES Well make him play Bridge Do him good if hes that
sort of fellow

LADY DEDMOND Is anyone else coming

GEORGE Reggie Huntingdon and the Fullartons

LADY DEDMOND Softly You know my dear boy Ive been meaning to
speak to you for a long time It is such a pity you and ClareWhat
is it

GEORGE God knows I try and I believe she does

SIR CHARLES Its distressinfor us you know my dear fellow
distressin

LADY DEDMOND I know its been going on for a long time

GEORGE Oh leave it alone mother

LADY DEDMOND But George Im afraid this man has brought it to a
pointput ideas into her head

GEORGE You cant dislike him more than I do But theres nothing
one can object to

LADY DEDMOND Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything now hes home
Brothers sometimes

GEORGE I cant bear my affairs being messed about

LADY DEDMOND Well it would be better for you and Clare to be
supposed to be out together than for her to be out alone Go
quietly into the diningroom and wait for her

SIR CHARLES Good Leave your mother to make up something Shell
do it

LADY DEDMOND That may be he Quick

 A bell sounds

 GEORGE goes out into the hall leaving the door open in his
 haste LADY DEDMOND following calls Paynter PAYNTER
 enters

LADY DEDMOND Dont say anything about your master and mistress
being out Ill explain

PAYNTER The master my lady

LADY DEDMOND Yes I know But you neednt say so Do you
understand

PAYNTER In polite dudgeon Just so my lady

 He goes out

SIR CHARLES By Jove That fellow smells a rat

LADY DEDMOND Be careful Charles

SIR CHARLES I should think so

LADY DEDMOND I shall simply say theyre dining out and that were
not to wait Bridge for them

SIR CHARLES Listening Hes having a palaver with that man of
Georges

 PAYNTER reappearing announces Captain Huntingdon SIR
 CHARLES and LADY DEDMOND turn to him with relief

LADY DEDMOND Ah Its you Reginald

HUNTINGDON A tall fair soldier of thirty How dyou do How are
you sir Whats the matter with their man

SHE CHARLES What

HUNTINGDON I was going into the diningroom to get rid of my cigar
and he said Not in there sir The masters there but my
instructions are to the effect that hes not

SHE CHARLES I knew that fellow

LADY DEDMOND The fact is Reginald Clares out and George is
waiting for her Its so important people shouldnt

HUNTINGDON Rather

 They draw together as people do discussing the misfortunes of
 members of their families

LADY DEDMOND Its getting serious Reginald I dont know whats
to become of them You dont think the Rectoryou dont think your
father would speak to Clare

HUNTINGDON Afraid the Governors hardly well enough He takes
anything of that sort to heart soespecially Clare

SIR CHARLES Cant you put in a word yourself

HUNTINGDON Dont know where the mischief lies

SIR CHARLES Im sure George doesnt gallop her on the road Very
steadygoin fellow old George

HUNTINGDON Oh yes George is all right sir

LADY DEDMOND They ought to have had children

HUNTINGDON Expect theyre pretty glad now they havent I really
dont know what to say maam

SIR CHARLES Saving your presence you know Reginald Ive often
noticed parsons daughters grow up queer Get too much morality and
rice puddin

LADY DEDMOND With a clear look Charles

SIR CHARLES What was she like when you were kids

HUNTINGDON Oh all right Could be rather a little devil of
course when her monkey was up

SIR CHARLES Im fond of her Nothing she wants that she hasnt
got is there

HUNTINGDON Never heard her say so

SIR CHARLES Dimly I dont know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her Hm

 A short silence

LADY DEDMOND Theres a Mr Malise coming here tonight I forget
if you know him

HUNTINGDON Yes Rather a thoroughbred mongrel

LADY DEDMOND Hes literary With hesitation Youyou dont
think heputserideas into her head

HUNTINGDON I asked Greyman the novelist about him seems hes a
bit of an Ishmaelite even among those fellows Cant see Clare

LADY DEDMOND No Only the great thing is that she shouldnt be
encouraged ListenIt is hercoming in I can hear their voices
Gone to her room What a blessing that man isnt here yet The
door bell rings Tt There he is I expect

SIR CHARLES What are we goin to say

HUNTINGDON Say theyre dining out and were not to wait Bridge for
them

SIR CHARLES Good

 The door is opened and PAYNTER announces Mr Kenneth Malise
 MALISE enters He is a tall man about thirtyfive with a
 strongly marked dark irregular ironic face and eyes which
 seem to have needles in their pupils His thick hair is rather
 untidy and his dress clothes not too new

LADY DEDMOND How do you do My son and daughterinlaw are so very
sorry Theyll be here directly

 MALISE bows with a queer curly smile

SIR CHARLES Shaking hands How dyou do sir

HUNTINGDON Weve met I think

 He gives MALISE that peculiar smiling stare which seems to warn
 the person bowed to of the sort of person he is MALISES eyes
 sparkle

LADY DEDMOND Clare will be so grieved One of those invitations

MALISE On the spur of the moment

SIR CHARLES You play Bridge sir

MALISE Afraid not

SIR CHARLES Dont mean that Then we shall have to wait for em

LADY DEDMOND I forget Mr Maliseyou write dont you

MALISE Such is my weakness

LADY DEDMOND Delightful profession

SIR CHARLES Doesnt tie you What

MALISE Only by the head

SIR CHARLES Im always thinkin of writin my experiences

MALISE Indeed

There is the sound of a door banged

SIR CHARLES Hastily You smoke Mr MALISE

MALISE Too much

SIR CHARLES Ah Must smoke when you think a lot

MALISE Or think when you smoke a lot

SIR CHARLES Genially Dont know that I find that

LADY DEDMOND With her clear look at him Charles

 The door is opened CLARE DEDMOND in a creamcoloured evening
 frock comes in from the hall followed by GEORGE She is rather
 pale of middle height with a beautiful figure wavy brown
 hair full smiling lips and large grey mesmeric eyes one of
 those women all vibration iced over with a trained stoicism of
 voice and manner

LADY DEDMOND Well my dear

SIR CHARLES Ah George Good dinner

GEORGE Giving his hand to MALISE How are you Clare Mr
MALISE

CLARE Smilingin a clear voice with the faintest possible lisp
Yes we met on the doormat Pause

SIR CHARLES Deuce you did An awkward pause

LADY DEDMOND Acidly Mr Malise doesnt play Bridge it appears
Afraid we shall be rather in the way of music

SIR CHARLES What Arent we goin to get a game PAYNTER has
entered with a tray

GEORGE Paynter Take that table into the dining room

PAYNTER Putting down the tray on a table behind the door Yes
sir

MALISE Let me give you a hand

 PAYNTER and MALISE carry one of the Bridge tables out GEORGE
 making a halfhearted attempt to relieve MALISE

SIR CHARLES Very fine sunset

 Quite softly CLARE begins to laugh All look at her first with
 surprise then with offence then almost with horror GEORGE is
 about to go up to her but HUNTINGDON heads him off

HUNTINGDON Bring the tray along old man

 GEORGE takes up the tray stops to look at CLARE then allows
 HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out

LADY DEDMOND Without looking at CLARE Well if were going to
play Charles She jerks his sleeve

SIR CHARLES What He marches out

LADY DEDMOND Meeting MALISE in the doorway Now you will be able
to have your music

 She follows the GENERAL out

 CLARE stands perfectly still with her eyes closed

MALISE Delicious

CLARE In her level clipped voice Perfectly beastly of me Im
so sorry I simply cant help running amok tonight

MALISE Never apologize for being fey Its much too rare

CLARE On the doormat And theyd whitewashed me so beautifully
Poor dears I wonder if I oughtShe looks towards the door

MALISE Dont spoil it

CLARE Id been walking up and down the Embankment for about three
hours One does get desperate sometimes

MALISE Thank God for that

CLARE Only makes it worse afterwards It seems so frightful to
them too

MALISE Softly and suddenly but with a difficulty in finding the
right words Blessed be the respectable May they dream ofme
And blessed be all men of the world May they perish of a surfeit
ofgood form

CLARE I like that Oh wont there be a row With a faint
movement of her shoulders And the usual reconciliation

MALISE Mrs Dedmond theres a whole world outside yours Why
dont you spread your wings

CLARE My dear fathers a saint and hes getting old and frail and
Ive got a sister engaged and three little sisters to whom Im
supposed to set a good example Then Ive no money and I cant do
anything for a living except serve in a shop I shouldnt be free
either so whats the good Besides I oughtnt to have married if I
wasnt going to be happy You see Im not a bit misunderstood or
illtreated Its only

MALISE Prison Break out

CLARE Turning to the window Did you see the sunset That white
cloud trying to fly up

 She holds up her bare arms with a motion of flight

MALISE Admiring her Ahhh Then as she drops her arms
suddenly Play me something

CLARE Going to the piano Im awfully grateful to you You dont
make me feel just an attractive female I wanted somebody like that
Letting her hands rest on the notes All the same Im glad not to
be ugly

MALISE Thank God for beauty

PAYNTER Opening the door Mr and Mrs Fullarton

MALISE Who are they

CLARE Rising Shes my chief pal He was in the Navy

 She goes forward MRS FULLERTON is a rather tall woman with
 dark hair and a quick eye He one of those cleanshaven naval
 men of good presence who have retired from the sea but not from
 their susceptibility

MRS FULLARTON Kissing CLARE and taking in both MALISE and her
husbands look at CLARE Weve only come for a minute

CLARE Theyre playing Bridge in the diningroom Mr Malise
doesnt play Mr MaliseMrs Fullarton Mr Fullarton

 They greet

FULLARTON Most awfully jolly dress Mrs Dedmond

MRS FULLARTON Yes lovely Clare FULLARTON abases eyes which
mechanically readjust themselves We cant stay for Bridge my dear
I just wanted to see you a minute thats all Seeing HUNTINGDON
coming in she speaks in a low voice to her husband Edward I want
to speak to Clare How dyou do Captain Huntingdon

MALISE Ill say goodnight

 He shakes hands with CLARE bows to MRS FULLARTON and makes
 his way out HUNTINGDON and FULLERTON foregather in the
 doorway

MRS FULLARTON How are things Clare CLARE just moves her
shoulders Have you done what I suggested Your room

CLARE No

MRS FULLARTON Why not

CLARE I dont want to torture him If I strikeIll go clean I
expect I shall strike

MRS FULLARTON My dear Youll have the whole world against you

CLARE Even you wont back me Dolly

MRS FULLARTON Of course Ill back you all thats possible but I
cant invent things

CLARE You wouldnt let me come to you for a bit till I could find
my feet

 MRS FULLARTON taken aback cannot refrain from her glance at
 FULLARTON automatically gazing at CLARE while he talks with
 HUNTINGDON

MRS FULLARTON Of coursethe only thing is that

CLARE With a faint smile Its all right Dolly Im not coming

MRS FULLARTON Oh dont do anything desperate Clareyou are so
desperate sometimes You ought to make termsnot tracks

CLARE Haggle She shakes her head What have I got to make terms
with What he still wants is just what I hate giving

MRS FULLARTON But Clare

CLARE No Dolly even you dont understand All day and every day
just as far apart as we can beand stillJolly isnt it If
youve got a soul at all

MRS FULLARTON Its awful really

CLARE I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do and go on
with it only you see I happen to have something in me thatcomes
to an end Cant endure beyond a certain time ever

 She has taken a flower from her dress and suddenly tears it to
 bits It is the only sign of emotion she has given

MRS FULLARTON Watching Look here my child this wont do You
must get a rest Cant Reggie take you with him to India for a bit

CLARE Shaking her head Reggie lives on his pay

MRS FULLARTON With one of her quick looks That was Mr Malise
then

FULLARTON Coming towards them I say Mrs Dedmond you wouldnt
sing me that little song you sang the other night He hums If I
might be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day Remember

MRS FULLARTON The falling dew Edward We simply must go
Clare Goodnight She kisses her

FULLARTON Taking halfcover between his wife and CLARE It suits
you down to the groundthat dress

CLARE Goodnight

 HUNTINGDON sees them out Left alone CLARE clenches her hands
 moves swiftly across to the window and stands looking out

HUNTINGDON Returning Look here Clare

CLARE Well Reggie

HUNTINGDON This is working up for a mess old girl You cant do
this kind of thing with impunity No manll put up with it If
youve got anything against George better tell me CLARE shakes
her head You ought to know I should stick by you What is it
Come

CLARE Get married and find out after a year that shes the wrong
person so wrong that you cant exchange a single real thought that
your blood runs cold when she kisses youthen youll know

HUNTINGDON My dear old girl I dont want to be a brute but its a
bit difficult to believe in that except in novels

CLARE Yes incredible when you havent tried

HUNTINGDON I mean youyou chose him yourself No one forced you
to marry him

CLARE It does seem monstrous doesnt it

HUNTINGDON My dear child do give us a reason

CLARE Look She points out at the night and the darkening towers
If George saw that for the first time hed just say Ah
Westminster Clock Tower Can you see the time by it As if one
cared where or what it wasbeautiful like that Apply that to every
everyeverything

HUNTINGDON Staring George may be a bit prosaic But my dear old
girl if thats all

CLARE Its not allits nothing I cant explain Reggieits
not reason at all itsits like being underground in a damp cell
its like knowing youll never get out Nothing comingnever
anything coming againnever anything

HUNTINGDON Moved and puzzled My dear old thing you mustnt get
into fantods like this If its like that dont think about it

CLARE When every day and every nightOh I know its my fault
for having married him but that doesnt help

HUNTINGDON Look here Its not as if George wasnt quite a decent
chap And its no use blinking things you are absolutely dependent
on him At home theyve got every bit as much as they can do to keep
going

CLARE I know

HUNTINGDON And youve got to think of the girls Any trouble would
be very beastly for them And the poor old Governor would feel it
awfully

CLARE If I didnt know all that Reggie I should have gone home
long ago

HUNTINGDON Well whats to be done If my pay would run to itbut
it simply wont

CLARE Thanks old boy of course not

HUNTINGDON Cant you try to see Georges side of it a bit

CLARE I do Oh dont lets talk about it

HUNTINGDON Well my child theres just one thing you wont go
sailing near the wind will you I mean there are fellows always on
the lookout

CLARE That chap Malise youd better avoid him Why

HUNTINGDON Well I dont know him He may be all right but hes
not our sort And youre too pretty to go on the tack of the New
Woman and that kind of thinghavent been brought up to it

CLARE British homemade summer goods light and attractivedont
wear long At the sound of voices in the hall They seem to be
going Reggie

 HUNTINGDON looks at her vexed unhappy

HUNTINGDON Dont head for trouble old girl Take a pull Bless
you Goodnight

 CLARE kisses him and when he has gone turns away from the door
 holding herself in refusing to give rein to some outburst of
 emotion Suddenly she sits down at the untouched Bridge table
 leaning her bare elbows on it and her chin on her hands quite
 calm GEORGE is coming in PAYNTER follows him

CLARE Nothing more wanted thank you Paynter You can go home
and the maids can go to bed

PAYNTER We are much obliged maam

CLARE I ran over a dog and had to get it seen to

PAYNTER Naturally maam

CLARE Goodnight

PAYNTER I couldnt get you a little anything maam

CLARE No thank you

PAYNTER No maam Goodnight maam

 He withdraws

GEORGE You neednt have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldnt deceive a guineapig Going up to her Pleased with
yourself tonight CLARE shakes her head Before that fellow
MALISE as if our own people werent enough

CLARE Is it worth while to rag me I know Ive behaved badly but
I couldnt help it really

GEORGE Couldnt help behaving like a shopgirl My God You were
brought up as well as I was

CLARE Alas

GEORGE To let everybody see that we dont get ontheres only one
word for itDisgusting

CLARE I know

GEORGE Then why do you do it Ive always kept my end up Why in
heavens name do you behave in this crazy way

CLARE Im sorry

GEORGE With intense feeling You like making a fool of me

CLARE NoReally OnlyI must break out sometimes

GEORGE There are things one does not do

CLARE I came in because I was sorry

GEORGE And at once began to do it again It seems to me you
delight in rows

CLARE Youd miss yourreconciliations

GEORGE For Gods sake Clare drop cynicism

CLARE And truth

GEORGE You are my wife I suppose

CLARE And they twain shall be onespirit

GEORGE Dont talk wild nonsense

 There is silence

CLARE Softly I dont give satisfaction Please give me notice

GEORGE Pish

CLARE Five years and four of them like this Im sure weve
served our time Dont you really think we might get on better
togetherif I went away

GEORGE Ive told you I wont stand a separation for no real reason
and have your name bandied about all over London I have some
primitive sense of honour

CLARE You mean your name dont you

GEORGE Look here Did that fellow Malise put all this into your
head

CLARE No my own evil nature

GEORGE I wish the deuce wed never met him Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of I distrust himand his looksand his
infernal satiric way He cant even dress decently Hes notgood
form

CLARE With a touch of rapture Ahh

GEORGE Why do you let him come What dyou find interesting in
him

CLARE A mind

GEORGE Deuced funny one To have a mindas you call itits not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature

CLARE We dont

GEORGE Then what do you talk aboutyour minds CLARE looks at
him Will you answer a straight question Is he falling in love
with you

CLARE You had better ask him

GEORGE I tell you plainly as a man of the world I dont believe
in the guide philosopher and friend business

CLARE Thank you

 A silence CLARE suddenly clasps her hands behind her head

CLARE Let me go Youd be much happier with any other woman

GEORGE Clare

CLARE I believeIm sure I could earn my living Quite serious

GEORGE Are you mad

CLARE It has been done

GEORGE It will never be done by youunderstand that

CLARE It really is time we parted Id go clean out of your life
I dont want your support unless Im giving you something for your
money

GEORGE Once for all I dont mean to allow you to make fools of us
both

CLARE But if we are already Look at us We go on and on Were
a spectacle

GEORGE Thats not my opinion nor the opinion of anyone so long as
you behave yourself

CLARE That isbehave as you think right

GEORGE Clare youre pretty riling

CLARE I dont want to be horrid But I am in earnest this time

GEORGE So am I

 CLARE turns to the curtained door

GEORGE Look here Im sorry God knows I dont want to be a
brute I know youre not happy

CLARE And youare you happy

GEORGE I dont say I am But why cant we be

CLARE I see no reason except that you are you and I am I

GEORGE We can try

CLARE I HAVEhavent you

GEORGE We used

CLARE I wonder

GEORGE You know we did

CLARE Too long agoif ever

GEORGE Coming closer Istill

CLARE Making a barrier of her hand You know thats only cupboard
love

GEORGE Weve got to face the facts

CLARE I thought I was

GEORGE The facts are that were marriedfor better or worse and
certain things are expected of us Its suicide for you and folly
for me in my position to ignore that You have all you can
reasonably want and I dontdont wish for any change If you
could bring anything against meif I drank or knocked about town
or expected too much of you Im not unreasonable in any way that I
can see

CLARE Well I think weve talked enough

 She again moves towards the curtained door

GEORGE Look here Clare you dont mean youre expecting me to put
up with the position of a man whos neither married nor unmarried
Thats simple purgatory You ought to know

CLARE Yes I havent yet have I

GEORGE Dont go like that Do you suppose were the only couple
whove found things arent what they thought and have to put up with
each other and make the best of it

CLARE Not by thousands

GEORGE Well why do you imagine they do it

CLARE I dont know

GEORGE From a common sense of decency

CLARE Very

GEORGE By Jove You can be the most maddening thing in all the
world Taking up a pack of cards he lets them fall with a long
slithering flutter After behaving as you have this evening you
might try to make some amends I should think

 CLARE moves her head from side to side as if in sight of
 something she could not avoid He puts his hand on her arm

CLARE No nono

GEORGE Dropping his hand Cant you make it up

CLARE I dont feel very Christian

 She opens the door passes through and closes it behind her
 GEORGE steps quickly towards it stops and turns back into the
 room He goes to the window and stands looking out shuts it
 with a bang and again contemplates the door Moving forward
 he rests his hand on the deserted card table clutching its
 edge and muttering Then he crosses to the door into the hall
 and switches off the light He opens the door to go out then
 stands again irresolute in the darkness and heaves a heavy sigh
 Suddenly he mutters No Crosses resolutely back to the
 curtained door and opens it In the gleam of light CLARE is
 standing unhooking a necklet

 He goes in shutting the door behind him with a thud


 CURTAIN





ACT II

 The scene is a large whitewashed disordered room whose outer
 door opens on to a corridor and stairway Doors on either side
 lead to other rooms On the walls are unframed reproductions of
 fine pictures secured with tintacks An old winecoloured
 armchair of low and comfortable appearance near the centre of
 the room is surrounded by a litter of manuscripts books ink
 pens and newspapers as though some one had already been up to
 his neck in labour though by a grandfathers clock it is only
 eleven On a smallish table close by are sheets of paper
 cigarette ends and two claret bottles There are many books on
 shelves and on the floor an overflowing pile whereon rests a
 soft hat and a black knobby stick MALISE sits in his
 armchair garbed in trousers dressinggown and slippers
 unshaved and uncollared writing He pauses smiles lights a
 cigarette and tries the rhythm of the last sentence holding up
 a sheet of quarto MS

MALISE Not a word not a whisper of Liberty from all those
excellent frockcoated gentlemennot a sign not a grimace Only
the monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant
Tyranny

 While he speaks a substantial woman a little over middleage
 in old dark clothes and a black straw hat enters from the
 corridor She goes to a cupboard brings out from it an apron
 and a Bissell broom Her movements are slow and imperturbable
 as if she had much time before her Her face is broad and dark
 with Chinese eyebrows

MALISE Wait Mrs Miller

 MILER gazes round her pins up her skirt sits down in the
 armchair takes off her hat and puts it on the table and slowly
 rolls up her sleeves then with her hands on her knees she

 the cupboard comes back to the table takes up a bottle and
 holds it to the light finding it empty she turns it upside
 down and drops it into the wastepaper basket then holding up
 the other bottle and finding it not empty she corks it and
 drops it into the fold of her skirt

CLARE Rising I think Ill come back later

MRS MILER Mr Malise is not in my confidence We keep each other

 She plucks that journal from out of the armchair and hands it to
 CLARE who sits doom again unhappily to brood MRS MILER makes
 a pass or two with a very dirty duster then stands still No
 longer hearing sounds CLARE looks up

MRS MILER I wouldnt interrupt yer with my workin but e likes

 She lifts a green paper screw of tobacco from the debris round
 the armchair and taps on the door It opens CLARE moves
 restlessly across the room

MRS MILER Speaking into the room The tobaccer The ladys

 CLARE has stopped before a reproduction of Titians picture
 Sacred and Profane Love MRS MILER stands regarding her with
 a Chinese smile MALISE enters a thread of tobacco still
 hanging to his cheek

MALISE Taking MRS MILERs hat off the table and handing it to
her Do the other room

 Enigmatically she goes

MALISE Jolly of you to come Can I do anything

CLARE I want advicebadly

MALISE What Spreading your wings

CLARE Yes

MALISE Ah Proud to have given you that advice When

CLARE The morning after you gave it me

MALISE Well

frightfully but somehow I thought I could make him see No good
He was awfully sweet onlyhe couldnt

MALISE Softly We English love liberty in those who dont belong
to us Yes

CLARE It was horrible There were the childrenand my old nurse
I could never live at home now Theyd think I was Impossible
utterly Id made up my mind to go back to my ownerAnd then
he came down himself I couldnt d it To be hauled back and begin
all over again I simply couldnt I watched for a chance and ran
to the station and came up to an hotel

MALISE Bravo

CLARE I dont knowno pluck this morning You see Ive got to
earn my livingno money only a few things I can sell All
yesterday I was walking about looking at the women How does anyone
ever get a chance

MALISE Sooner than you should hurt his dignity by working your
husband would pension you off

CLARE If I dont go back to him I couldnt take it

MALISE Good

CLARE Ive thought of nursing but its a long training and I do
so hate watching pain The fact is Im pretty hopeless cant even
do art work I came to ask you about the stage

MALISE Have you ever acted CLARE shakes her head You mightnt
think so but Ive heard theres a prejudice in favour of training
Theres ChorusI dont recommend it How about your brother

CLARE My brothers got nothing to spare and he wants to get
married and hes going back to India in September The only friend
I should care to bother is Mrs Fullarton and shesgot a husband

MALISE I remember the gentleman

CLARE Besides I should be besieged day and night to go back I
must lie doggo somehow

MALISE It makes my blood boil to think of women like you God help
all ladies without money

CLARE I expect I shall have to go back

MALISE No no We shall find something Keep your soul alive at
all costs What let him hang on to you till youre nothing but
emptiness and ache till you lose even the power to ache Sit in his
drawingroom pay calls play Bridge go out with him to dinners
return toduty and feel less and less and be less and less and so
grow old anddie

 The bell rings

MALISE Looking at the door in doubt By the wayhed no means of
tracing you

 She shakes her head

 The bell rings again

MALISE Was there a man on the stairs as you came up

CLARE Yes Why

MALISE Hes begun to haunt them Im told

CLARE Oh But that would mean they thought Ioh no

MALISE Confidence in me is not excessive

CLARE Spying

MALISE Will you go in there for a minute Or shall we let them
ringorwhat It may not be anything of course

CLARE Im not going to hide

 The bell rings a third time

MALISE Opening the door of the inner room Mrs Miler just see
who it is and then go for the present

 MRS MILER comes out with her hat on passes enigmatically to
 the door and opens it A mans voice says Mr Malise Would
 you give him these cards

MRS MILER Reentering The cards

MALISE Mr Robert Twisden Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond He
looks at CLARE

CLARE Her face scornful and unmoved Let them come

MALISE TO MRS MILER Show them in

 TWISDEN entersa cleanshaved shrewdlooking man with a
 fighting underlip followed by SIR CHARLES and LADY DEDMOND
 MRS MILER goes There are no greetings

TWISDEN Mr Malise How do you do Mrs Dedmond Had the
pleasure of meeting you at your wedding CLARE inclines her head
I am Mr George Dedmonds solicitor sir I wonder if you would be
so very kind as to let us have a few words with Mrs Dedmond alone

 At a nod from CLARE MALISE passes into the inner room and
 shuts the door A silence

SIR CHARLES Suddenly What

LADY DEDMOND Mr Twisden will you

TWISDEN Uneasy Mrs Dedmond I must apologize but youyou
hardly gave us an alternative did you He pauses for an answer
and not getting one goes on Your disappearance has given your
husband great anxiety Really my dear madam you must forgive us
for thisattempt to get into communication

CLARE Why did you spy HERE

SIR CHARLES No no Nobodys spied on you What

TWISDEN Im afraid the answer is that we appear to have been
justified At the expression on CLARES face he goes on hastily
Now Mrs Dedmond Im a lawyer and I know that appearances are
misleading Dont think Im unfriendly I wish you well CLARE
raises her eyes Moved by that look which is exactly as if she had
said I have no friends he hurries on What we want to say to you
is this Dont let this split go on Dont commit yourself to what
youll bitterly regret Just tell us whats the matter Im sure it
can be put straight

CLARE I have nothing against my husbandit was quite unreasonable
to leave him

TWISDEN Come thats good

CLARE Unfortunately theres something stronger than reason

TWISDEN I dont know it Mrs Dedmond

CLARE No

TWISDEN Disconcerted Are youyou oughtnt to take a step without
advice in your position

CLARE Nor with it

TWISDEN Approaching her Come now isnt there anything you feel
youd like to saythat might help to put matters straight

CLARE I dont think so thank you

LADY DEDMOND You must see Clare that

TWISDEN In your position Mrs Dedmonda beautiful young woman
without money Im quite blunt This is a hard world Should be
awfully sorry if anything goes wrong

CLARE And if I go back

TWISDEN Of two evils if it be sochoose the least

CLARE I am twentysix he is thirtytwo We cant reasonably
expect to die for fifty years

LADY DESMOND Thats morbid Clare

TWISDEN Whats open to you if you dont go back Come whats your
position Neither fish flesh nor fowl fair game for everybody
Believe me Mrs Dedmond for a pretty woman to strike as it appears
youre doing simply because the spirit of her marriage has taken
flight is madness You must know that no one pays attention to
anything but facts If nowexcuse meyouyou had a lover His
eyes travel round the room and again rest on her you would at all
events have some ground under your feet some sort of protection
but He pauses as you have notyouve none

CLARE Except what I make myself

SIR CHARLES Good God

TWISDEN Yes Mrs Dedmond Theres the bedrock difficulty As
you havent money you should never have been pretty Youre up
against the world and youll get no mercy from it We lawyers see
too much of that Im putting it brutally as a man of the world

CLARE Thank you Do you think you quite grasp the alternative

TWISDEN Taken aback But my dear young lady there are two sides
to every contract After all your husbands fulfilled his

CLARE So have I up till now I shant ask anything from him
nothingdo you understand

LADY DEDMOND But my dear you must live

TWISDEN Have you ever done any sort of work

CLARE Not yet

TWISDEN Any conception of the competition nowadays

CLARE I can try

 TWISDEN looking at her shrugs his shoulders

CLARE Her composure a little broken by that look Its real to
methisyou see

SIR CHARLES But my dear girl what the devils to become of
George

CLARE He can do what he likesits nothing to me

TWISDEN Mrs Dedmond I say without hesitation youve no notion of
what youre faced with brought up to a sheltered life as youve
been Do realize that you stand at the parting of the ways and one
leads into the wilderness

CLARE Which

TWISDEN Glancing at the door through which MALISE has gone Of
course if you want to play at wild asses there are plenty who will
help you

SIR CHARLES By Gad Yes

CLARE I only want to breathe

TWISDEN Mrs Dedmond go back You can now It will be too late
soon There are lots of wolves about Again he looks at the door

CLARE But not where you think You say I need advice I came here
for it

TWISDEN With a curiously expressive shrug In that case I dont
know that I can usefully stay

 He goes to the outer door

CLARE Please dont have me followed when I leave here Please

LADY DEDMOND George is outside Clare

CLARE I dont wish to see him By what right have you come here
She goes to the door through which MALISE has passed opens it and
says Please come in Mr Malise

 MALISE enters

TWISDEN I am sorry Glancing at MALISE he inclines his head I
am sorry Good morning He goes

LADY DEDMOND Mr Malise Im sure will see

CLARE Mr Malise will stay here please in his own room

 MALISE bows

SIR CHARLES My dear girl pon my soul you know I cant grasp
your line of thought at all

CLARE No

LADY DEDMOND George is most willing to take up things just as they
were before you left

CLARE Ah

LADY DEDMOND Quite franklywhat is it you want

CLARE To be left alone Quite frankly he made a mistake to have
me spied on

LADY DEDMOND But my good girl if youd let us know where you
were like a reasonable being You cant possibly be left to
yourself without money or position of any kind Heaven knows what
youd be driven to

MALISE Softly Delicious

SIR CHARLES You will be good enough to repeat that out loud sir

LADY DEDMOND Charles Clare you must know this is all a fit of
spleen your duty and your interestmarriage is sacred Clare

CLARE Marriage My marriage has become thethe reconciliationof
two animalsone of them unwilling Thats all the sanctity there is
about it

SIR CHARLES What

 She looks at MALISE

LADY DEDMOND You ought to be horribly ashamed CLARE Of the
factI am

LADY DEDMOND Darting a glance at MALISE If we are to talk this
out it must be in private

MALISE To CLARE Do you wish me to go

CLARE No

LADY DEDMOND At MALISE I should have thought ordinary decent
feelingGood heavens girl Cant you see that youre being played
with

CLARE If you insinuate anything against Mr Malise you lie

LADY DEDMOND If you will do these thingscome to a mans rooms

CLARE I came to Mr Malise because hes the only person I know
with imagination enough to see what my position is I came to him a
quarter of an hour ago for the first time for definite advice and
you instantly suspect him That is disgusting

LADY DEDMOND Frigidly Is this the natural place for me to find
my sons wife

CLARE His woman

LADY DEDMOND Will you listen to Reginald

CLARE I have

LADY DEDMOND Havent you any religious sense at all Clare

CLARE None if its religion to live as we do

LADY DEDMOND Its terriblethis state of mind Its really
terrible

 CLARE breaks into the soft laugh of the other evening As if
 galvanized by the sound SIR CHARLES comes to life out of the
 transfixed bewilderment with which he has been listening

SIR CHARLES For Gods sake dont laugh like that

 CLARE Stops

LADY DEDMOND With real feeling For the sake of the simple right
Clare

CLARE Right Whatever else is rightour life is not She puts
her hand on her heart I swear before God that Ive tried and tried
I swear before God that if I believed we could ever again love each
other only a little tiny bit Id go back I swear before God that I
dont want to hurt anybody

LADY DEDMOND But you are hurting everybody Dodo be reasonable

CLARE Losing control Cant you see that Im fighting for all my
life to comenot to be buried alivenot to be slowly smothered
Look at me Im not waxIm flesh and blood And you want to
prison me for everbody and soul

 They stare at her

SIR CHARLES Suddenly By Jove I dont know I dont know
What

LADY DEDMOND To MALISE If you have any decency left sir you
will allow my son at all events to speak to his wife alone
Beckoning to her husband Well wait below

SIR CHARLES II want to speak To CLARE My dear if you feel
like this I can only sayas aas a gentleman

LADY DEDMOND Charles

SIR CHARLES Let me alone I can only say thatdamme I dont know
that I can say anything

 He looks at her very grieved then turns and marches out
 followed by LADY DEDMOND whose voice is heard without answered
 by his What In the doorway as they pass GEORGE is
 standing he comes in

GEORGE Going up to CLARE who has recovered all her selfcontrol
Will you come outside and speak to me

CLARE No

 GEORGE glances at MALISE who is leaning against the wall with
 folded arms

GEORGE In a low voice Clare

CLARE Well

GEORGE You try me pretty high dont you forcing me to come here
and speak before this fellow Most men would think the worst
finding you like this

CLARE You need not have comeor thought at all

GEORGE Did you imagine I was going to let you vanish without an
effort

CLARE To save me

GEORGE For Gods sake be just Ive come here to say certain
things If you force me to say them before himon your head be it
Will you appoint somewhere else

CLARE No

GEORGE Why not

CLARE I know all those certain things You must come back It
is your duty You have no money Your friends wont help you You
cant earn your living You are making a scandal You might even
say for the moment Your room shall be respected

GEORGE Well its true and youve no answer

CLARE Oh Suddenly Our lifes a lie Its stupid its
disgusting Im tired of it Please leave me alone

GEORGE You rather miss the point Im afraid I didnt come here
to tell you what you know perfectly well when youre sane I came
here to say this Anyone in her senses could see the game your friend
here is playing It wouldnt take a baby in If you think that a
gentleman like that His stare travels round the dishevelled room
till it rests on MALISE champions a pretty woman for nothing you
make a fairly bad mistake

CLARE Take care

 But MALISE after one convulsive movement of his hands has
 again become rigid

GEORGE I dont pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing but I
have ordinary common sense I dont attempt to be superior to plain
facts

CLARE Under her breath Facts

GEORGE Oh for goodness sake drop that hifalutin tone It
doesnt suit you Look here If you like to go abroad with one of
your young sisters until the autumn Ill let the flat and go to the
Club

CLARE Put the fire out with a penny hose Slowly I am not
coming back to you George The farce is over

GEORGE Taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone
suddenly fronts MALISE Then there is something between you and this
fellow

MALISE Dangerously but without moving I beg your pardon

CLARE Thereisnothing

GEORGE Looking from one to the other At all events I wontI
wont see a woman who onceCLARE makes a sudden effacing movement
with her hands I wont see her go to certain ruin without lifting a
finger

CLARE That is noble

GEORGE With intensity I dont know that you deserve anything of
me But on my honour as a gentleman I came here this morning for
your sake to warn you of what youre doing He turns suddenly on
MALISE And I tell this precious friend of yours plainly what I
think of him and that Im not going to play into his hands

 MALISE without stirring from the wall looks at CLARE and his
 lips move

CLARE Shakes her head at himthen to GEORGE Will you go
please

GEORGE I will go when you do

MALISE A man of the world should know better than that

GEORGE Are you coming

MALISE That is inconceivable

GEORGE Im not speaking to you sir

MALISE You are right Your words and mine will never kiss each
other

GEORGE Will you come CLARE shakes her head

GEORGE With fury Dyou mean to stay in this pigsty with that
rhapsodical swine

MALISE Transformed By God if you dont go Ill kill you

GEORGE As suddenly calm That remains to be seen

MALISE With most deadly quietness Yes I will kill you

 He goes stealthily along the wall takes up from where it lies
 on the pile of books the great black knobby stick and
 stealthily approaches GEORGE his face quite fiendish

CLARE With a swift movement grasping the stick Please

 MALISE resigns the stick and the two men perfectly still
 glare at each other CLARE letting the stick fall puts her
 foot on it Then slowly she takes off her hat and lays it on
 the table

CLARE Now will you go There is silence

GEORGE Staring at her hat You mad little fool Understand this
if youve not returned home by three oclock Ill divorce you and
you may roll in the gutter with this highsouled friend of yours
And mind this you sirI wont spare youby God Your pocket shall
suffer Thats the only thing that touches fellows like you

 Turning he goes out and slams the door CLARE and MALISE
 remain face to face Her lips have begun to quiver

CLARE Horrible

 She turns away shuddering and sits down on the edge of the
 armchair covering her eyes with the backs of her hands MALISE
 picks up the stick and fingers it lovingly Then putting it
 down he moves so that he can see her face She is sitting
 quite still staring straight before her

MALISE Nothing could be better

CLARE I dont know what to do I dont know what to do

MALISE Thank the stars for your good fortune

CLARE He means to have revenge on you And its all my fault

MALISE Let him Let him go for his divorce Get rid of him Have
done with himsomehow

 She gets up and stands with face averted Then swiftly turning
 to him

CLARE If I must bring you harmlet me pay you back I cant bear
it otherwise Make some use of me if you dont mind

MALISE My God

 She puts up her face to be kissed shutting her eyes

MALISE You poor

 He clasps and kisses her then drawing back looks in her face
 She has not moved her eyes are still closed but she is
 shivering her lips are tightly pressed together her hands
 twitching

MALISE Very quietly No no This is not the house of a
gentleman

CLARE Letting her head fall and almost in a whisper Im sorry

MALISE I understand

CLARE I dont feel And withoutI cant cant

MALISE Bitterly Quite right Youve had enough of that

 There is a long silence Without looking at him she takes up
 her hat and puts it on

MALISE Not going

 CLARE nods

MALISE You dont trust me

CLARE I do But I cant take when Im not giving

MALISE I begI beg you What does it matter Use me Get free
somehow

CLARE Mr Malise I know what I ought to be to you if I let you in

MALISE I give you my solemn word

CLARE No if I cant be that to youits not real And I cant
It isnt to be manufactured is it

MALISE It is not

CLARE To make use of you in such a way No

 She moves towards the door

MALISE Where are you going

 CLARE does not answer She is breathing rapidly There is a
 change in her a sort of excitement beneath her calmness

MALISE Not back to him CLARE shakes her head Thank God But
where To your people again

CLARE No

MALISE Nothingdesperate

CLARE Oh no

MALISE Then whattell mecome

CLARE I dont know Women manage somehow

MALISE Seizing her arm Dyou imagine theyll let you off out

CLARE Holding out her hand Goodbye

MALISE Not taking that hand This great damned world andyou
Listen The sound of the traffic far down below is audible in the
stillness Into that alonehelplesswithout money The men who
work with you the men you make friends ofdyou think theyll let
you be The men in the streets staring at you stopping youpudgy
bullnecked brutes devils with hard eyes senile swine and the
chivalrous men like me who dont mean you harm but cant help
seeing youre made for love Or suppose you dont take covert but
struggle on in the open Society The respectable The pious
Even those who love you Will they let you be Hue and cry The
hunt was joined the moment you broke away It will never let up
Covert to coverttill theyve run you down and youre back in the
cart and God pity you

CLARE Well Ill die running

MALISE No no Let me shelter you Let me

CLARE Shaking her head and smiling Im going to seek my fortune
Wish me luck

MALISE I cant let you go

CLARE You must

 He looks into her face then realizing that she means it
 suddenly bends down to her fingers and puts his lips to them

MALISE Good luck then Good luck

 He releases her hand Just touching his bent head with her
 other hand CLARE turns and goes MALISE remains with bowed
 head listening to the sound of her receding footsteps They
 die away He raises himself and strikes out into the air with
 his clenched fist


 CURTAIN




ACT III

 MALISES sittingroom An afternoon three months later
 On the table are an open bottle of claret his hat and some
 teathings Down in the hearth is a kettle on a lighted
 spiritstand Near the door stands HAYWOOD a short roundfaced
 man with a tobaccocoloured moustache MALISE by the table is
 contemplating a piece of blue paper

HAYWOOD Sorry to press an old customer sir but a year and an alf
without any return on your money

MALISE Your tobacco is too good Mr Haywood I wish I could see
my way to smoking another

HAYWOOD Well sirthats a funny remedy

 With a knock on the halfopened door a Boy appears

MALISE Yes What is it

BOY Your copy for The Watchfire please sir

MALISE Motioning him out Yes Wait

 The Boy withdraws MALISE goes up to the pile of books turns
 them over and takes up some volumes

MALISE This is a very fine unexpurgated translation of Boccaccios
Decameron Mr Haywood illustrated I should say you would get
more than the amount of your bill for them

HAYWOOD Shaking his head Them books worth three pound seven

MALISE Its scarce and highly improper Will you take them in
discharge

HAYWOOD Torn between emotions Well I ardly know what to say
No Sir I dont think Id like to ave to do with that

MALISE You could read them first you know

HAYWOOD Dubiously Ive got my wife at ome

MALISE You could both read them

HAYWOOD Brought to his bearings No Sir I couldnt

MALISE Very well Ill sell them myself and you shall have the
result

HAYWOOD Well thank you sir Im sure I didnt want to trouble
you

MALISE Not at all Mr Haywood Its for me to apologize

HAYWOOD So long as I give satisfaction

MALISE Holding the door for him Certainly Good evening

HAYWOOD Good evenin sir no offence I hope

MALISE On the contrary

 Doubtfully HAYWOOD goes And MALISE stands scratching his head
 then slipping the bill into one of the volumes to remind him he
 replaces them at the top of the pile The Boy again advances
 into the doorway

MALISE Yes now for you

 He goes to the table and takes some sheets of MS from an old
 portfolio But the door is again timidly pushed open and
 HAYWOOD reappears

MALISE Yes Mr Haywood

HAYWOOD About that little matter sir Ifif its any convenience
to youIvethought of a place where I could

MALISE Read them Youll enjoy them thoroughly

HAYWOOD No sir no Where I can dispose of them

MALISE Holding out the volumes It might be as well HAYWOOD
takes the books gingerly I congratulate you Mr Haywood its a
classic

HAYWOOD Oh indeedyes sir In the event of there being any

MALISE Anything over Carry it to my credit Your billHe
hands over the blue paper Send me the receipt Good evening

 HAYWOOD nonplussed and trying to hide the books in an evening
 paper fumbles out Good evenin sir and departs MALISE
 again takes up the sheets of MS and cons a sentence over to
 himself gazing blankly at the stolid BOY

MALISE Man of the worldgood form your god Poor buttonedup
philosopher the Boy shifts his feet inbred to the point of
cretinism and founded to the bone on fear of ridicule the Boy
breathes heavilyyou are the slave of facts

 There is a knock on the door

MALISE Who is it

 The door is pushed open and REGINALD HUNTINGDON stands there

HUNTINGDON I apologize sir can I come in a minute

 MALISE bows with ironical hostility

HUNTINGDON I dont know if you remember meClare Dedmonds
brother

MALISE I remember you

 He motions to the stolid Boy to go outside again

HUNTINGDON Ive come to you sir as a gentleman

MALISE Some mistake There is one I believe on the first floor

HUNTINGDON Its about my sister

MALISE Dn you Dont you know that Ive been shadowed these last
three months Ask your detectives for any information you want

HUNTINGDON We know that you havent seen her or even known where
she is

MALISE Indeed Youve found that out Brilliant

HUNTINGDON We know it from my sister

MALISE Oh So youve tracked her down

HUNTINGDON Mrs Fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those
big shopsselling gloves

MALISE Mrs Fullarton the lady with the husband Well youve got
her Clap her back into prison

HUNTINGDON We have not got her She left at once and we dont
know where shes gone

MALISE Bravo

HUNTINGDON Taking hold of his bit Look here Mr Malise in a
way I share your feeling but Im fond of my sister and its
damnable to have to go back to India knowing she must be all adrift
without protection going through God knows what Mrs Fullarton
says shes looking awfully pale and down

MALISE Struggling between resentment and sympathy Why do you
come to me

HUNTINGDON We thought

MALISE Who

HUNTINGDON Mymy father and myself

MALISE Go on

HUNTINGDON We thought there was just a chance that having lost
that job she might come to you again for advice If she does it
would be really generous of you if youd put my father in touch with
her Hes getting old and he feels this very much He hands
MALISE a card This is his address

MALISE Twisting the card Let there be no mistake sir I do
nothing that will help give her back to her husband Shes out to
save her soul alive and I dont join the hue and cry thats after
her On the contraryif I had the power If your father wants to
shelter her thats another matter But shed her own ideas about
that

HUNTINGDON Perhaps you dont realize how unfit my sister is for
rough and tumble Shes not one of this new sort of woman Shes
always been looked after and had things done for her Pluck shes
got but thats all and shes bound to come to grief

MALISE Very likelythe first birds do But if she drops halfway
its better than if shed never flown Your sister sir is trying
the wings of her spirit out of the old slave market For women as
for men theres more than one kind of dishonour Captain Huntingdon
and worse things than being dead as you may know in your profession

HUNTINGDON Admittedbut

MALISE We each have our own views as to what they are But they
all come todeath of our spirits for the sake of our carcases
Anything more

HUNTINGDON My leaves up I sail tomorrow If you do see my
sister I trust you to give her my love and say I begged she would see
my father

MALISE If I have the chanceyes

 He makes a gesture of salute to which HUNTINGDON responds
 Then the latter turns and goes out

MALISE Poor fugitive Where are you running now

 He stands at the window through which the evening sunlight is
 powdering the room with smoky gold The stolid Boy has again
 come in MALISE stares at him then goes back to the table
 takes up the MS and booms it at him he receives the charge
 breathing hard

MALISE Man of the worldproduct of a material age incapable of
perceiving reality in motions of the spirit having no use as you
would say for sentimental nonsense accustomed to believe yourself
the national spineyour position is unassailable You will remain
the idol of the countryarbiter of law parson in mufti darling of
the playwright and the novelistGod bless youwhile waters lap
these shores

 He places the sheets of MS in an envelope and hands them to
 the Boy

MALISE Youre going straight back to The Watchfire

BOY Stolidly Yes sir

MALISE Staring at him Youre a masterpiece Dyou know that

BOY No sir

MALISE Get out then

 He lifts the portfolio from the table and takes it into the
 inner room The Boy putting his thumb stolidly to his nose
 turns to go In the doorway he shies violently at the figure of
 CLARE standing there in a darkcoloured dress skids past her
 and goes CLARE comes into the gleam of sunlight her white
 face alive with emotion or excitement She looks round her
 smiles sighs goes swiftly to the door closes it and comes
 back to the table There she stands fingering the papers on
 the table smoothing MALISEs hat wistfully eagerly waiting

MALISE Returning You

CLARE With a faint smile Not very glorious is it

 He goes towards her and checks himself then slews the armchair
 round

MALISE Come Sit down sit down CLARE heaving a long sigh
sinks down into the chair Teas nearly ready

 He places a cushion for her and prepares tea she looks up at
 him softly but as he finishes and turns to her she drops that
 glance

CLARE Do you think me an awful coward for coming She has taken a
little plain cigarette case from her dress Would you mind if I
smoked

 MALISE shakes his head then draws back from her again as if
 afraid to be too close And again unseen she looks at him

MALISE So youve lost your job

CLARE How did you

MALISE Your brother You only just missed him CLARE starts up
They had an idea youd come Hes sailing tomorrowhe wants you to
see your father

CLARE Is father ill

MALIE Anxious about you

CLARE Ive written to him every week Excited Theyre still
hunting me

MALISE Touching her shoulder gently Its all rightall right

 She sinks again into the chair and again he withdraws And
 once more she gives him that soft eager look and once more
 averts it as he turns to her

CLARE My nerves have gone funny lately Its being always on ones
guard and stuffy air and feeling people look and talk about you
and dislike your being there

MALISE Yes that wants pluck

CLARE Shaking her head I curl up all the time The only thing I
know for certain is that I shall never go back to him The more
Ive hated what Ive been doing the more sure Ive been I might
come to anythingbut not that

MALISE Had a very bad time

CLARE Nodding Im spoilt Its a curse to be a lady when you
have to earn your living Its not really been so hard I suppose
Ive been selling things and living about twice as well as most shop
girls

MALISE Were they decent to you

CLARE Lots of the girls are really nice But somehow they dont
want me cant help thinking Ive got airs or something and in here
She touches her breast I dont want them

MALISE I know

CLARE Mrs Fullarton and I used to belong to a society for helping
reduced gentlewomen to get work I know now what they want enough
money not to workthats all Suddenly looking up at him Dont
think me worse than I amplease Its working under people its
having to do it being driven I have tried Ive not been
altogether a coward really But every morning getting there the
same time every day the same stale dinner as they call it every
evening the same Good evening Miss Clare Good evening Miss
Simpson Good evening Miss Hart Good evening Miss Clare
And the same walk home or the same bus and the same men that you
mustnt look at for fear theyll follow you She rises Oh and
the feelingalways alwaysthat theres no sun or life or hope or
anything It was just like being ill the way Ive wanted to ride
and dance and get out into the country Her excitement dies away
into the old clipped composure and she sits down again Dont think
too badly of meit really is pretty ghastly

MALISE Gruffly Hm Why a shop

CLARE References I didnt want to tell more lies than I could
help a married woman on strike cant tell the truth you know And
I cant typewrite or do shorthand yet And chorusI thoughtyou
wouldnt like

MALISE I What have I He checks himself  Have men been
brutes

CLARE Stealing a look at him One followed me a lot He caught
hold of my arm one evening I just took this out She draws out her
hatpin and holds it like a dagger her lip drawn back as the lips of
a dog going to bite and said Will you leave me alone please
And he did It was rather nice And there was one quite decent
little man in the shopI was sorry for himsuch a humble little
man

MALISE Poor devilits hard not to wish for the moon

 At the tone of his voice CLARE looks up at him his face is
 turned away

CLARE Softly How have you been Working very hard

MALISE As hard as God will let me

CLARE Stealing another look Have you any typewriting I could do
I could learn and Ive still got a brooch I could sell Which is
the best kind

MALISE I had a catalogue of them somewhere

 He goes into the inner room The moment he is gone CLARE
 stands up her hands pressed to her cheeks as if she felt them
 flaming Then with hands clasped she stands waiting He
 comes back with the old portfolio

MALISE Can you typewrite where you are

CLARE I have to find a new room anyway Im changingto be safe
She takes a luggage ticket from her glove I took my things to
Charing Crossonly a bag and one trunk Then with that queer
expression on her face which prefaces her desperations You dont
want me now I suppose

MALISE What

CLARE Hardly above a whisper Becauseif you still wanted me
I donow

 Etext editors note In the 1924 revision 11 years after this
 1913 edition I donow is changed to I couldnow
 a significant change in meaning DW

MALISE Staring hard into her face that is quivering and smiling
You mean it You do You care

CLARE Ive thought of youso much But onlyif youre sure

 He clasps her and kisses her closed eyes and so they stand for
 a moment till the sound of a latchkey in the door sends them
 apart

MALISE Its the housekeeper Give me that ticket Ill send for
your things

 Obediently she gives him the ticket smiles and goes quietly
 into the inner room MRS MILER has entered her face more
 Chinese than ever shows no sign of having seen

MALISE That lady will stay here Mrs Miler Kindly go with this
ticket to the cloakroom at Charing Cross station and bring back her
luggage in a cab Have you money

MRS MILER Arf a crown She takes the ticketthen impassively
In case you dont knowtheres two o them men about the stairs now

 The moment she is gone MALISE makes a gesture of maniacal fury
 He steals on tiptoe to the outer door and listens Then
 placing his hand on the knob he turns it without noise and
 wrenches back the door Transfigured in the last sunlight
 streaming down the corridor are two men close together
 listening and consulting secretly They start back

MALISE With strange almost noiseless ferocity Youve run her to
earth your jobs done Kennel up hounds And in their faces he
slams the door


 CURTAIN

The room has now a certain daintiness There are curtains over the
doors a couch under the window all the books are arranged on
shelves In small vases over the fireplace are a few violets and
chrysanthemums MALISE sits huddled in his armchair drawn close to
the fore paper on knee pen in hand He looks rather grey and

 the room behind her MALISE takes up his paper and pen The
 paper is quite blank

 He drops paper and pen and crossing to the room on the left
 goes in CLARE reenters with a small leather box She puts it
 down on her typing table as MALISE returns followed by MRS
 MILER wearing her hat and carrying His overcoat

MRS MILER Put your coat on Its a bitter wind

 He puts on the coat

CLARE Where are you going

 MRS MILER opens the door wide says Come in and goes MRS
 FULLARTON is accompanied not by FULLARTON but by the lawyer
 TWISDON They come in

MRS FULLARTON Clare My dear How are you after all this time

CLARE Her eyes fixed on TWISDEN Yes

MRS FULLARTON Disconcerted by the strange greeting I brought
Mr Twisden to tell you something May I stay

CLARE Yes She points to the chair at the same table MRS
FULLARTON sits down Now

 TWISDEN comes forward

TWISDEN As youre not defending this case Mrs Dedmond there is
nobody but yourself for me to apply to

CLARE Please tell me quickly what youve come for

TWISDEN Bowing slightly I am instructed by Mr Dedmond to say
that if you will leave your present companion and undertake not to
see him again he will withdraw the suit and settle three hundred a
year on you At CLAREs movement of abhorrence Dont
misunderstand me pleaseit is notit could hardly be a request
that you should go back Mr Dedmond is not prepared to receive you
again The proposalforgive my saying soremarkably Quixoticis
made to save the scandal to his family and your own It binds you to
nothing but the abandonment of your present companion with certain
conditions of the same nature as to the future In other words it
assures you a positionso long as you live quietly by yourself

CLARE I see Will you please thank Mr Dedmond and say that I
refuse

MRS FULLARTON Clare Clare For Gods sake dont be desperate

 CLARE deathly still just looks at her

TWISDEN Mrs Dedmond I am bound to put the position to you in its
naked brutality You know theres a claim for damages

CLARE I have just learnt it

TWISDEN You realize what the result of this suit must be You will
be left dependent on an undischarged bankrupt To put it another
way youll be a stone round the neck of a drowning man

CLARE You are cowards

MRS FULLARTON Clare Clare To TWISDEN She doesnt mean it
please be patient

CLARE I do mean it You ruin him because of me You get him down
and kick him to intimidate me

MRS FULLARTON My dear girl Mr Twisden is not personally
concerned How can you

CLARE If I were dying and it would save me I wouldnt take a
penny from my husband

TWISDEN Nothing could be more bitter than those words Do you
really wish me to take them back to him

CLARE Yes She turns from them to the fire

MRS FULLARTON In a low voice to TWISDEN Please leave me alone
with her dont say anything to Mr Dedmond yet

TWISDEN Mrs Dedmond I told you once that I wished you well
Though you have called me a coward I still do that For Gods sake
thinkbefore its too late

CLARE Putting out her hand blindly Im sorry I called you a
coward Its the whole thing I meant

TWISDEN Never mind that Think

 With the curious little movement of one who sees something he
 does not like to see he goes CLARE is leaning her forehead
 against the mantelshelf seemingly unconscious that she is not
 alone MRS FULLARTON approaches quietly till she can see
 CLARES face

MRS FULLARTON My dear sweet thing dont be cross with met CLARE
turns from her It is all the time as if she were trying to get away
from words and people to something going on within herself How can
I help wanting to see you saved from all this ghastliness

CLARE Please dont Dolly Let me be

MRS FULLARTON I must speak Clare I do think youre hard on
George Its generous of him to offer to withdraw the suit
considering You do owe it to us to try and spare your father and
your sisters andand all of us who care for you

CLARE Facing her You say George is generous If he wanted to be
that hed never have claimed these damages Its revenge he wantsI
heard him here You think Ive done him an injury So I didwhen I
married him I dont know what I shall come to Dolly but I shant
fall so low as to take money from him Thats as certain as that I
shall die

MRS FULLARTON Do you know Clare I think its awful about you
Youre too fine and not fine enough to put up with things youre
too sensitive to take help and youre not strong enough to do
without it Its simply tragic At any rate you might go home to
your people

CLARE After this

MRS FULLARTON To us then

CLARE If I could be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day
No Dolly

 MRS FULLARTON turns from her ashamed and baffled but her quick
 eyes take in the room trying to seize on some new point of
 attack

MRS FULLARTON You cant beyou arenthappy here

CLARE Arent I

MRS FULLARTON Oh Clare Save yourselfand all of us

CLARE Very still You see I love him

MRS FULLARTON You used to say youd never love did not want it
would never want it

CLARE Did I How funny

MRS FULLARTON Oh my dear Dont look like that or youll make
me cry

CLARE One doesnt always know the future does one Desperately
I love him I love him

MRS FULLARTON Suddenly If you love him what will it be like for
you knowing youve ruined him

CLARE Go away Go away

MRS FULLARTON Loveyou said

CLARE Quivering at that stabsuddenly I mustI will keep him
Hes all Ive got

MRS FULLARTON Can youcan you keep him

CLARE Go

MRS FULLARTON Im going But men are hard to keep even when
youve not been the ruin of them You know whether the love this man
gives you is really love If notGod help you She turns at the
door and says mournfully Goodbye my child If you can

 Then goes CLARE almost in a whisper repeats the words
 Love you said At the sound of a latchkey she runs as if to
 escape into the bedroom but changes her mind and stands blotted
 against the curtain of the door MALISE enters For a moment
 he does not see her standing there against the curtain that is
 much the same colour as her dress His face is that of a man in
 the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent Then seeing
 her he pulls himself together walks to his armchair and sits
 down there in his hat and coat

CLARE Well The Watchfire You may as well tell me

MALISE Nothing to tell you child

 At that touch of tenderness she goes up to his chair and kneels
 down beside it Mechanically MALISE takes off his hat

CLARE Then you are to lose that too MALISE stares at her I
know about itnever mind how

MALISE Sanctimonious dogs

CLARE Very low There are other things to be got arent there

MALISE Thick as blackberries I just go out and cry MALISE
unsuccessful author too honest journalist freethinker
corespondent bankrupt and they tumble

CLARE Quietly Kenneth do you care for me MALISE stares at
her Am I anything to you but just prettiness

MALISE Now now This isnt the time to brood Rouse up and
fight

CLARE Yes

MALISE Were not going to let them down us are we She rubs her
cheek against his hand that still rests on her shoulder Life on
sufferance breath at the pleasure of the enemy And some day in the
fullness of his mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and
drink and breathe again His gesture sums up the rage within him
Fine He puts his hat on and rises Thats the last groan they get
from me

CLASS Are you going out again He nods Where

MALISE Blackberrying Our trains not till six

 He goes into the bedroom CLARE gets up and stands by the fire
 looking round in a dazed way She puts her hand up and
 mechanically gathers together the violets in the little vase
 Suddenly she twists them to a buttonhole and sinks down into
 the armchair which he must pass There she sits the violets
 in her hand MALISE comes out and crosses towards the outer
 door She puts the violets up to him He stares at them
 shrugs his shoulders and passes on For just a moment CLARE
 sits motionless

CLARE Quietly Give me a kiss

 He turns and kisses her But his lips after that kiss have
 the furtive bitterness one sees on the lips of those who have
 done what does not suit their mood He goes out She is left
 motionless by the armchair her throat working Then
 feverishly she goes to the little table seizes a sheet of
 paper and writes Looking up suddenly she sees that MRS MILER
 has let herself in with her latchkey

MRS MILER Ive settled the baker the milk the washin an the
groceriesthis eres whats left

 She counts down a fivepound note four sovereigns and two
 shillings on to the little table CLARE folds the letter into
 an envelope then takes up the fivepound note and puts it into
 her dress

CLARE Pointing to the money on the table Take your wages and
give him this when he comes in Im going away

MRS MILER Without him Whenll you be comin back

CLARE Rising I shant be coming back Gazing at MRS MILERS
hands which are plaiting at her dress Im leaving Mr Malise and
shant see him again And the suit against us will be withdrawnthe
divorce suityou understand

MRS MILER Her face all broken up I never meant to say anything
to yer

CLARE Its not you I can see for myself Dont make it harder
help me Get a cab

MRS MILER Disturbed to the heart The porters outside cleanin
the landin winder

CLARE Tell him to come for my trunk It is packed She goes into
the bedroom

MRS MILER Opening the doordesolately Come ere

 The PORTER appears in shirtsleeves at the door

MRS MILER The lady wants a cab Wait and carry er trunk down

 CLARE comes from the bedroom in her hat and coat

MRS MILER TO the PORTER Now

 They go into the bedroom to get the trunk CLARE picks up from
 the floor the bunch of violets her fingers play with it as if
 they did not quite know what it was and she stands by the
 armchair very still while MRS MILER and the PORTER pass her
 with trunk and bag And even after the PORTER has shouldered
 the trunk outside and marched away and MRS MILER has come
 back into the room CLARE still stands there

MRS MILER Pointing to the typewriter Dyou want this ere too

CLARE Yes

 MRS MILER carries it out Then from the doorway gazing at
 CLARE taking her last look she sobs suddenly At sound of
 that sob CLARE throws up her head

CLARE Dont Its all right Goodbye

 She walks out and away not looking back MRS MILER chokes her
 sobbing into the black stuff of her thick old jacket

ACT IV

 Suppertime in a small room at The Gascony on Derby Day
 Through the windows of a broad corridor out of which the door
 opens is seen the dark blue of a summer night The walls are
 of apricotgold the carpets curtains lampshades and gilded
 chairs of red the woodwork and screens white the palms in
 gilded tubs A doorway that has no door leads to another small
 room One little table behind a screen and one little table in
 the open are set for two persons each On a servicetable
 above which hangs a speakingtube are some dishes of hors
 douvres a basket of peaches two bottles of champagne in
 icepails and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub ARNAUD
 the waiter slim dark quick his face seamed with a quiet
 soft irony is opening oysters and listening to the robust joy
 of a distant supperparty where a man is playing the last bars
 of Do ye ken John Peel on a horn As the sound dies away he
 murmurs Tres Joli and opens another oyster Two Ladies with
 bare shoulders and large hats pass down the corridor Their
 talk is faintly wafted in Well I never like Derby night The
 boys do get so bobbish That hornvulgar I call it

 ARNAUDS eyebrows rise the corners of his mouth droop A Lady
 with bare shoulders and crimson roses in her hair comes along
 the corridor and stops for a second at the window for a man to
 join her They come through into the room ARNAUD has sprung
 to attention but with Lets go in here shall we they pass
 through into the further room The MANAGER a gentleman with
 neat moustaches and buttoned into a frockcoat has appeared
 brisk noiseless his eyes everywhere he inspects the peaches

MANAGER Four shillin apiece tonight see

ARNAUD Yes Sare

 From the inner room a young man and his partner have come in
 She is dark almost Spanishlooking he fair languid pale
 cleanshaved slackly smiling with halfclosed eyesone of
 those who are bred and dissipated to the point of having lost
 all save the capacity for hiding their emotions He speaks in
 a

LANGUID VOICE Awful row theyre kickin up in there Mr Varley
A fellow with a horn

MANAGER Blandly Gaddesdon Hunt my lordalways have their
supper with us Derby night Quiet corner here my lord Arnaud

 ARNAUD is already at the table between screen and palm And
 there ensconced the couple take their seats Seeing them
 safely landed the MANAGER brisk and noiseless moves away In
 the corridor a lady in black with a cloak falling open seems
 uncertain whether to come in She advances into the doorway
 It is CLARE

ARNAUD Pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes Nice
table Madame

 CLARE moves to the corner of it An artist in observation of
 his clients ARNAUD takes in her facevery pale under her wavy
 simplydressed hair shadowy beneath the eyes not powdered her
 lips not reddened without a single ornament takes in her black
 dress finely cut her arms and neck beautifully white and at
 her breast three gardenias And as he nears her she lifts her
 eyes It is very much the look of something lost appealing for
 guidance

ARNAUD Madame is waiting for some one She shakes her head Then
Madame will be veree well hereveree well I take Madames cloak

 He takes the cloak gently and lays it on the back of the chair
 fronting the room that she may put it round her when she
 wishes She sits down

LANGUID VOICE From the corner Waiter

ARNAUD Milord

LANGUID VOICE The Roederer

ARNAUD At once Milord

 CLARE sits tracing a pattern with her finger on the cloth her
 eyes lowered Once she raises them and follows ARNAUDs dark
 rapid figure

ARNAUD Returning Madame feels the eat He scans her with
increased curiosity You wish something Madame

CLARE Again giving him that look Must I order

ARNAUD Non Madame it is not necessary A glass of water He
pours it out I have not the pleasure of knowing Madames face

CLARE Faintly smiling No

ARNAUD Madame will find it veree good ere veree quiet

LANGUID VOICE Waiter

ARNAUD Pardon He goes

 The barenecked ladies with large hats again pass down the
 corridor outside and again their voices are wafted in Tottie
 Not she Oh my goodness she has got a pride on her
 Bobbiell never stick it Look here dear Galvanized
 by those sounds CLARE has caught her cloak and halfrisen they
 die away and she subsides

ARNAUD Back at her table with a quaint shrug towards the
corridor It is not rowdy here Madame as a rulenot as in some
places Tonight a little noise Madame is fond of flowers He
whisks out and returns almost at once with a bowl of carnations from
some table in the next room These smell good

CLARE You are very kind

ARNAUD With courtesy Not at all Madame a pleasure He bows

 A young man tall thin hard straight with closecropped
 sandyish hair and moustache a face tanned very red and one of
 those small long lean heads that only grow in Britain clad in
 a thin dark overcoat thrown open an opera hat pushed back a
 white waistcoat round his lean middle he comes in from the
 corridor He looks round glances at CLARE passes her table
 towards the further room stops in the doorway and looks back
 at her Her eyes have just been lifted and are at once cast
 down again The young man wavers catches ARNAUDs eye jerks
 his head to summon him and passes into the further room
 ARNAUD takes up the vase that has been superseded and follows
 him out And CLARE sits alone in silence broken by the murmurs
 of the languid lord and his partner behind the screen She is
 breathing as if she had been running hard She lifts her eyes
 The tall young man divested of hat and coat is standing by her
 table holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness

YOUNG MAN How dyou do Didnt recognize you at first So sorry
awfully rude of me

 CLARES eyes seem to fly from him to appeal to him to resign
 herself all at once Something in the YOUNG MAN responds He
 drops his hand

CLARE Faintly How dyou do

YOUNG MAN Stammering Youyou been down there today

CLARE Where

YOUNG MAN With a smile The Derby What Dont you generally go
down He touches the other chair May I

CLARE Almost in a whisper Yes

 As he sits down ARNAUD returns and stands before them

ARNAUD The plovers eggs veree good tonight Sare Veree good
Madame A peach or two after Veree good peaches The Roederer
Sarenot bad at all Madame likes it frappe but not too coldyes

 He is away again to his servicetable

YOUNG MAN Burying his face in the carnations I saythese are
jolly arent they They do you pretty well here

CLARE Do they

YOUNG MAN Youve never been here CLARE shakes her head By Jove
I thought I didnt know your face CLARE looks full at him Again
something moves in the YOUNG MAN and he stammers I meannot

CLARE It doesnt matter

YOUNG MAN Respectfully Of course if Iif you were waiting for
anybody or anythingI

 He half rises

CLARE Its all right thank you

 The YOUNG MAN sits down again uncomfortable nonplussed There
 is silence broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord
 and the distant merriment of the supperparty ARNAUD brings
 the plovers eggs

YOUNG MAN The wine quick

ARNAUD At once Sare

YOUNG MAN Abruptly Dont you ever go racing then

CLARE No

 ARNAUD pours out champagne

YOUNG MAN I remember awfully well my first day It was pretty
thicklost every blessed bob and my watch and chain playin three
cards on the way home

CLARE Everything has a beginning hasnt it

 She drinks The YOUNG MAN stares at her

YOUNG MAN Floundering in these waters deeper than he had bargained
for I sayabout things having beginningsdid you mean anything

 CLARE nods

YOUNG MAN What Dyou mean its really the first

 CLARE nods The champagne has flicked her courage

YOUNG MAN By George He leans back Ive often wondered

ARNAUD Again filling the glasses Monsieur finds

YOUNG MAN Abruptly Its all right

 He drains his glass then sits bolt upright Chivalry and the
 camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him

YOUNG MAN Of course I can see that youre notI mean that youre
aa lady CLARE smiles And I say you knowif you have to
because youre in a holeI should feel a cad Let me lend you

CLARE Holding up her glass Le vin est tire il faut le boire

 She drinks The French words which he does not too well
 understand completing his conviction that she is a lady he
 remains quite silent frowning As CLARE held up her glass two
 gentlemen have entered The first is blond of good height and
 a comely insolence His crisp fair hair and fair brushedup
 moustache are just going grey an eyeglass is fixed in one of
 two eyes that lord it over every woman they see his face is
 broad and coloured with air and wine His companion is a tall
 thin dark bird of the night with sly roving eyes and hollow
 cheeks They stand looking round then pass into the further
 room but in passing they have stared unreservedly at CLARE

YOUNG MAN Seeing her wince Look here Im afraid you must feel
me rather a brute you know

CLARE No I dont really

YOUNG MAN Are you absolute stoney CLARE nods But Looking at
her frock and cloak youre so awfully well

CLARE I had the sense to keep them

YOUNG MAN More and more disturbed I say you knowI wish youd
let me lend you something I had quite a good day down there

CLARE Again tracing her pattern on the cloththen looking up at
him full I cant take for nothing

YOUNG MAN By Jove I dont knowreally I dontthis makes me
feel pretty rotten I mean its your being a lady

CLARE Smiling Thats not your fault is it You see Ive been
beaten all along the line And I really dont care what happens to
me She has that peculiar fey look on her face now I really
dont except that I dont take charity Its lucky for me its you
and not some

The supperparty is getting still more boisterous and there comes a
long view holloa and a blast of the horn

YOUNG MAN But I say what about your people You must have people
of some sort

 He is fast becoming fascinated for her cheeks have begun to
 flush and her eyes to shine

CLARE Oh yes Ive had people and a husband andeverything
And here I am Queer isnt it She touches her glass This is
going to my head Do you mind I shant sing songs and get up and
dance and I wont cry I promise you

YOUNG MAN Between fascination and chivalry By George One
simply cant believe in this happening to a lady

CLARE Have you got sisters Breaking into her soft laughter My
brothers in India I shant meet him anyway

YOUNG MAN No butI sayare you really quite cut off from
everybody CLARE nods Something rather awful must have happened

 She smiles The two gentlemen have returned The blond one is
 again staring fixedly at CLARE This time she looks back at
 him flaming and with a little laugh he passes with his
 friend into the corridor

CLARE Who are those two

YOUNG MAN Dont knownot been much about town yet Im just back
from India myself You said your brother was there whats his
regiment

CLARE Shaking her head Youre not going to find out my name I
havent got onenothing

 She leans her bare elbows on the table and her face on her
 hands

CLARE First of June This day last year I broke covertIve been
running ever since

YOUNG MAN I dont understand a bit Youmust have had aasome
one

 But there is such a change in her face such rigidity of her
 whole body that he stops and averts his eyes When he looks
 again she is drinking She puts the glass down and gives a
 little laugh

YOUNG MAN With a sort of awe Anyway it must have been like
riding at a pretty stiff fence for you to come here tonight

CLARE Yes Whats the other side

 The YOUNG MAN puts out his hand and touches her arm It is
 meant for sympathy but she takes it for attraction

CLARE Shaking her head Not yet please Im enjoying this May
I have a cigarette

 He takes out his case and gives her one

CLARE Letting the smoke slowly forth Yes Im enjoying it Had
a pretty poor time lately not enough to eat sometimes

YOUNG MAN Not really How damnable I saydo have something more
substantial

 CLARE gives a sudden gasp as if going off into hysterical
 laughter but she stifles it and shakes her head

YOUNG MAN A peach

 ARNAUD brings peaches to the table

CLARE Smiling Thank you

 He fills their glasses and retreats

CLARE Raising her glass Eat and drink for tomorrow weListen

 From the supperparty comes the sound of an abortive chorus
 With a hey ho chivy hark forrard hark forrard tantivy
 Jarring out into a discordant whoop it sinks

CLARE This day a stag must die Jolly old song

YOUNG MAN Rowdy lot Suddenly I sayI admire your pluck

CLARE Shaking her head Havent kept my end up Lots of women do
You see Im too fine and not fine enough My best friend said
that Too fine and not fine enough She laughs I couldnt be a
saint and martyr and I wouldnt be a soulless doll Neither one
thing nor the otherthats the tragedy

YOUNG MAN You must have had awful luck

CLARE I did try Fiercely But whats the goodwhen theres
nothing before youDo I look ill

YOUNG MAN No simply awfully pretty

CLARE With a laugh A man once said to me As you havent money
you should never have been pretty But you see it is some good
If I hadnt been I couldnt have risked coming here could I Dont
you think it was rather sporting of me to buy these She touches the
gardenias with the last shilling over from my cab fare

YOUNG MAN Did you really Dd sporting

CLARE Its no use doing things by halves is it Imin for it
wish me luck She drinks and puts her glass down with a smile In
for itdeep She flings up her hands above her smiling face Down
down till theyre just above water and thendown down down and
all over Are you sorry now you came and spoke to me

YOUNG MAN By Jove no It may be caddish but Im not

CLARE Thank God for beauty I hope I shall die pretty Do you
think I shall do well

YOUNG MAN I saydont talk like that

CLARE I want to know Do you

YOUNG MAN Well thenyes I do

CLARE Thats splendid Those poor women in the streets would give
their eyes wouldnt theythat have to go up and down up and down
Do you think Ishall

 The YOUNG MAN halfrising puts his hand on her arm

YOUNG MAN I think youre getting much too excited You look all
Wont you eat your peach She shakes her head Do Have something
else thensome grapes or something

CLARE No thanks

 She has become quite calm again

YOUNG MAN Well then what dyou think Its awfully hot in here
isnt it Wouldnt it be jollier drivin Shall weshall we make a
move

CLARE Yes

 The YOUNG MAN turns to look for the waiter but ARNAUD is not in
 the room He gets up

YOUNG MAN Feverishly Dn that waiter Wait half a minute if
you dont mind while I pay the bill

 As he goes out into the corridor the two gentlemen reappear
 CLARE is sitting motionless looking straight before her

DARK ONE A fiver you dont get her to

BLOND ONE Done

 He advances to her table with his inimitable insolence and
 taking the cigar from his mouth bends his stare on her and
 says Charmed to see you lookin so well Will you have supper
 with me here tomorrow night Startled out of her reverie
 CLARE looks up She sees those eyes she sees beyond him the
 eyes of his companionsly malevolent amusedwatching and she
 just sits gazing without a word At that regard so clear the
 BLOND ONE does not wince But rather suddenly he says Thats
 arranged then Halfpast eleven So good of you Goodnight
 He replaces his cigar and strolls back to his companion and in
 a low voice says Pay up Then at a languid Hullo Charles
 they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen
 CLARE has not moved nor changed the direction of her gaze
 Suddenly she thrusts her hand into the pocket of the cloak that
 hangs behind her and brings out the little blue bottle which
 six months ago she took from MALISE She pulls out the cork
 and pours the whole contents into her champagne She lifts the
 glass holds it before hersmiling as if to call a toast then
 puts it to her lips and drinks Still smiling she sets the
 empty glass down and lays the gardenia flowers against her
 face Slowly she droops back in her chair the drowsy smile
 still on her lips the gardenias drop into her lap her arms
 relax her head falls forward on her breast And the voices
 behind the screen talk on and the sounds of joy from the
 supperparty wax and wane

 The waiter ARNAUD returning from the corridor passes to his
 servicetable with a tall beribboned basket of fruit Putting
 it down he goes towards the table behind the screen and sees
 He runs up to CLARE

ARNAUD Madame Madame He listens for her breathing then
suddenly catching sight of the little bottle smells at it Bon Dieu

 At that queer sound they come from behind the screenall four
 and look The dark night bird says Hallo fainted ARNAUD
 holds out the bottle

LANGUID LORD Taking it and smelling Good God The woman bends
over CLARE and lifts her hands ARNAUD rushes to his servicetable
and speaks into his tube

ARNAUD The boss Quick Looking up he sees the YOUNG MAN
returning Monsieur elle a fui Elle est morte

LANGUID LORD To the YOUNG MAN standing there aghast Whats this
Friend of yours

YOUNG MAN My God She was a lady Thats all I know about her

LANGUID LORD A lady

 The blond and dark gentlemen have slipped from the room and out
 of the supperpartys distant laughter comes suddenly a long
 shrill Gone away And the sound of the horn playing the seven
 last notes of the old song This day a stag must die From the
 last note of all the sound flies up to an octave higher sweet
 and thin like a spirit passing till it is drowned once more in
 laughter The YOUNG MAN has covered his eyes with his hands
 ARNAUD is crossing himself fervently the LANGUID LORD stands
 gazing with one of the dropped gardenias twisted in his
 fingers and the woman bending over CLARE kisses her forehead
