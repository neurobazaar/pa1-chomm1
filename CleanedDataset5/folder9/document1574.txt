HISTORIC GIRLS

Stories Of Girls Who Have Influenced The History Of Their Times

By E S Brooks




PREFACE

In these progressive days when so much energy and discussion are
devoted to what is termed equality and the rights of woman it is well
to remember that there have been in the distant past women and girls
even who by their actions and endeavors proved themselves the equals of
the men of their time in valor shrewdness and ability

This volume seeks to tell for the girls and boys of today the stories
of some of their sisters of the longagogirls who by eminent position
or valiant deeds became historic even before they had passed the
charming season of girlhood

Their stories are fruitful of varying lessons for some of these
historic girls were wilful as well as courageous and mischievous as
well as tenderhearted

But from all the lessons and from all the morals one truth stands out
most clearlythe fact that age and country time and surroundings make
but little change in the real girlnature that has ever been impulsive
trusting tender and true alike in the days of the Syrian Zenobia and
in those of the modern American schoolgirl

After all whatever the opportunity whatever the limitation whatever
the possibilities of this same neverchanging girlnature no better
precept can be laid down for our own bright young maidens as none
better can be deduced from the stories herewith presented than that
phrased in Kingsleys noble yet simple verse

 Be good sweet maid and let who will be clever
 Do noble things not dream them all day long
 And so make life death and the vast forever
 One grand sweet song


Grateful acknowledgment is made by the author for the numerous
expressions of interest that came to him from his girlreaders as the
papers now gathered into bookform appeared from time to time in the
pages of St Nicholas The approval of those for whom one studies and
labors is the pleasantest and most enduring return

ZENOBIA OF PALMYRA THE GIRL OF THE SYRIAN DESERT

Afterward known as Zenobia Augusta Queen of the East AD 250

MANY and many miles and many days journey toward the rising sun over
seas and mountains and desertsfarther to the east than Rome or
Constantinople or even Jerusalem and old Damascusstand the ruins of
a once mighty city scattered over a mountainwalled oasis of the great
Syrian desert thirteen hundred feet above the sea and just across the
northern border of Arabia Look for it in your geographies It is known
as Palmyra Today the jackal prowls through its deserted streets and
the lizard suns himself on its fallen columns while thirty or forty
miserable Arabian huts huddle together in a small corner of what was
once the great courtyard of the magnificent Temple of the Sun

And yet sixteen centuries ago Palmyra or Tadmor as it was originally
called was one of the most beautiful cities in the world Nature and
art combined to make it glorious Like a glittering mirage out of the
sandswept desert arose its palaces and temples and grandly sculptured
archways With aqueducts and monuments and gleaming porticos with
countless groves of palmtrees and gardens full of verdure with wells
and fountains market and circus with broad streets stretching away to
the city gates and lined on either side with magnificent colonnades of
rosecolored marblesuch was Palmyra in the year of our Lord 250 when
in the soft Syrian month of Nisan or April in an open portico in the
great colonnade and screened from the sun by gayly colored awnings two
young peoplea boy of sixteen and a girl of twelvelooked down upon
the beautiful Street of the Thousand Columns as lined with bazaars and
thronged with merchants it stretched from the wonderful Temple of the
Sun to the triple Gateway of the Sepulchre nearly a mile away

Both were handsome and healthytrue children of old Tadmor that
glittering fairylike city which Arabian legends say was built by the
genii for the great King Solomon ages and ages ago Midway between
the Mediterranean and the Euphrates it was the meetingplace for the
caravans from the east and the wagon trains from the west and it had
thus become a city of merchant princes a wealthy commercial republic
like Florence and Venice in the middle agesthe common tollgate for
both the East and West

But though a tributary colony of Rome it was so remote a dependency
of that mighty mistress of the world that the yoke of vassalage was
but carelessly worn and lightly felt The great merchants and chiefs
of caravans who composed its senate and directed its affairs and
whose glittering statues lined the sculptured cornice of its marble
colonnades had more power and influence than the faroff Emperor at
Rome and but small heed was paid to the slender garrison that acted as
guard of honor to the strategi or special officers who held the colony
for Rome and received its yearly tribute And yet so strong a force was
Rome in the world that even this freetempered desert city had gradually
become Romanized in manners as in name so that Tadmor had become first
Adrianapolis and then Palmyra And this influence had touched even these
children in the portico For their common ancestora wealthy merchant
of a century beforehad secured honor and rank from the Emperor
Septimus Severusthe man who walled in England and of whom it was
said that he never performed an act of humanity or forgave a fault
Becoming by the Emperors grace a Roman citizen this merchant of
Palmyra according to a custom of the time took the name of his royal
patron as that of his own fahdh or family and the father of young
Odhainat in the portico as was Odhainat himself was known as Septimus
Odaenathus while the young girl found her Arabic name of Bath Zabbai
Latinized into that of Septima Zenobia

But as thinking nothing of all this they looked lazily on the throng
below a sudden exclamation from the lad caused his companion to raise
her flashing black eyes inquiringly to his face

What troubles you my Odhainat she asked

There there look there Bath Zabbai replied the boy excitedly
coming through the Damascus arch and we thought him to be in Emesa

The girls glance followed his guiding finger but even as she looked a
clear trumpet peal rose above the din of the city while from beneath
a sculptured archway that spanned a colonnaded crossstreet the bright
April sun gleamed down upon the standard of Rome with its eagle crest
and its S P Q R design beneath There is a second trumpet peal and
swinging into the great Street of the Thousand Columns at the head
of his lightarmed legionaries rides the centurion Rufinus lately
advanced to the rank of tribune of one of the chief Roman cohorts in
Syria His coming as Odhainat and even the young Bath Zabbai knew
meant a stricter supervision of the city a reenforcement of its
garrison and the assertion of the mastership of Rome over this far
eastern province on the Persian frontier

But why should the coming of the Roman so trouble you my Odhainat
she asked We are neither Jew nor Christian that we should fear his
wrath but free Palmyreans who bend the knee neither to Roman nor
Persian masters

Who WILL bend the knee no longer be it never so little my cousin
exclaimed the lad hotly as this very day would have shown had not this
crafty Rufinusmay great Solomons genii dash him in the seacome
with his cohort to mar our measures Yet seewho cometh now he cried
and at once the attention of the young people was turned in the
opposite direction as they saw streaming out of the great fortresslike
courtyard of the Temple of the Sun another hurrying throng

Then young Odhainat gave a cry of joy

See Bath Zabbai they come they come he cried It is my father
Odhainat the esarkos1 with all the leaders and all the bowmen and
spearmen of our fahdh armed and in readiness This day will we fling off
the Roman yoke and become the true and unconquered lords of Palmyra And
I too Must join them he added

1 The head man or chief of the fahdh or family


But the young girl detained him Wait cousin she said watch and
wait Our fahdh will scarce attempt so brave a deed today with these
new Roman soldiers in our gates That were scarcely wise

But the boy broke out again So they have seen each other he said
both sides are pressing on

True and they will meet under this very portico said Bath Zabbai
and moved both by interest and desire this darkeyed Syrian girl to
whom fear was never known standing by her cousins side looked down
upon the tossing sea of spears and lances and glittering shields and
helmets that swayed and surged in the street below

So Odaenathus said Rufinus the tribune reining in his horse and
speaking in harsh and commanding tones what meaneth this array of
armed followers

Are the movements of Septimus Odaenathus the headman of such
importance to the noble tribune that he must needs question a free
merchant of Palmyra as to the number and manner of his servants asked
Odaemathus haughtily

Dog of a Palmyrean slave of a cameldriver said the Roman angrily
trifle not with me Were you ten times the free merchant you claim you
should not thus reply Free forsooth None are free but Romans

Have a care O Rufinus said the Palmyrean boldly choose wiser words
if you would have peaceful ways Palmyra brooks no such slander of her
foremost men

And Rome brooks no such men as you traitor said Rufinus Ay
traitor I say he repeated as Odaenathus started at the word Think
not to hide your plots to overthrow the Roman power in your city and
hand the rule to the base Sapor of Persia Every thing is known to
our great father the Emperor and thus doth he reckon with traitors
Macrinus strike and at his word the short Gallic sword in the ready
hand of the big German footsoldier went straight to its mark and
Odaenathus the headman of Palmyra lay dead in the Street of the
Thousand Columns

So sudden and so unexpected was the blow that the Palmyreans stood as if
stunned unable to comprehend what had happened But the Roman was swift
to act

Sound trumpets Down pikes he cried and as the trumpet peal rose
loud and clear fresh legionaries came hurrying through the Damascus
arch and the pilum1 and spatha of Rome bore back the shields and
lances of Palmyra

1 The pilum was the Roman pike and the spatha the short singleedged
Roman sword


But before the lowered pikes could fully disperse the crowd the
throng parted and through the swaying mob there burst a lithe and flying
figurea brownskinned maid of twelve with streaming hair loose robe
and angry flashing eyes Right under the lowered pikes she darted and
all flushed and panting defiantly faced the astonished Rufinus Close
behind her came an equally excited lad who when he saw the stricken
body of his father on the marble street flung himself weeping upon it
But Bath Zabbais eyes flashed still more angrily

Assassin murderer she cried you have slain my kinsman and
Odhainats father How dare you how dare you she repeated vehemently
and then flushing with deeper scorn she added Roman I hate you
Would that I were a man Then should all Palmyra know how

Scourge these children home broke in the stern Rufinus or fetch
them by the ears to their nurses and their toys Let the boys and girls
of Palmyra beware how they mingle in the matters of their elders or in
the plots of their fathers Men of Palmyra you who today have dared
to think of rebellion look on your leader here and know how Rome deals
with traitors But because the merchant Odaenathus bore a Roman name
and was of Roman rankho soldiers bear him to his house and let
Palmyra pay such honor as befits his name and station

The struggling children were half led half carried into the sculptured
atrium1 of the palace of Odaenathus which embowered in palms and
vines and wonderful Eastern plants stood back from the marble colonnade
on the Street of the Thousand Columns And when in that same atrium
the body of the dead merchant lay embalmed and draped for its long
home2 there kneeling by the stricken form of the murdered father
and kinsman and with uplifted hand after the vindictive manner of
these fierce old days of blood Odaemathus and Zenobia swore eternal
hatred to Rome

1 The large central livingroom of a Roman palace

2 The Palmyreans built great towertombs beautiful in architecture
and adornment the ruins of which still stand on the hill slopes
overlooking the old city These they called their long homes and you
will find the word used in the same sense in Ecclesiastes xii 5


Hatred boys and girls is a very ugly as it is a very headstrong fault
but as there is a good side even to a bad habit so there is a hatred
which may rise to the heighth of a virtue Hatred of vice IS virtue
hatred of tyranny is patriotism It is this which has led the world from
slavery to freedom from ignorance to enlightenment and inspired the
words that have found immortality alike above the ashes of Bradshaw
the regicide and of Jefferson the American Rebellion to tyrants is
obedience to God

But how could a fatherless boy and girl away off on the edge of an
Arabian desert hope to resist successfully the mighty power of Imperial
Rome The story of their lives will tell

If there are some people who are patriots there are others who are
poltroons and such a one was Hairan the elder brother of young
Odhainat when succeeding to his dead fathers wealth and power he
thought less of Roman tyranny than of Roman gold

Revenge ourselves on their purses my brother and not on their pikes
he said T is easier and more profitable to sap the Romans gold than
to shed the Romans blood

But this submission to Rome only angered Odhainat and to such a
conflict of opinion did it lead that at last Hairan drove his younger
brother from the home of his fathers and the lad an Esau among the
Jacobs of Tadmor so the record tells us spent his youth amid the
roving Bedaween of the Arabian deserts and the mountaineers of the
Armenian hills waiting his time

But though a homeless exile the darkeyed Bath Zabbai did not forget
him In the palace of another kinsman Septimus Worod the lord of the
markets she gave herself up to careful study and hoped for the day
of Palmyras freedom As rich in powers of mind as in the graces of
form and face she soon became a wonderful scholar for those distant
daysmistress of four languages Coptic Syriac Latin and Greek
while the fiery temper of the girl grew into the nobler ambitions of the
maiden But above all things as became her mingled Arabic and Egyptian
bloodfor she could trace her ancestry back to the free chiefs of the
Arabian desert and to the dauntless Cleopatra of Egyptshe loved the
excitement of the chase and in the plains and mountains beyond the city
she learned to ride and hunt with all the skill and daring of a young
Diana

And so it came to pass that when the Emperor Valerian sent an embassy
from Rome to Ctesiphon bearing a message to the Great King as Sapor
the Persian monarch was called the embassy halted in Palmyra and
Septimus Hairan now the headman of the city ordered in the name of
the senate and people of Palmyra a grand venatio or wild beast hunt
in the circus near the Street of the Thousand Columns in honor of
his Roman guests And he despatched his kinsman Septimus Zabbai the
soldier to the Armenian hills to superintend the capture and delivery
of the wild game needed for the hunt With a great following of slaves
and huntsmen Zabbai the soldier departed and with him went his niece
Bath Zabbai or Zenobia now a fearless young huntress of fifteen Space
will not permit to tell of the wonders and excitement of that wildbeast
hunta hunt in which none must be killed but all must be captured
without mar or wound Such a trapping of wolves and bears and buffaloes
was there such a setting of nets and pitfalls for the mountain lion and
the Syrian leopard while the Arab hunters beat and drove and shouted
or lay in wait with net and blunted lance that it was rare sport to the
fearless Zenobia who rode her fleet Arabian horse at the very head of
the chase and with quick eye and practised hand helped largely to
swell the trophies of the hunt What girl of today whom even the
pretty little jumpingmouse of Syria would scare out of her wits could
be tempted to witness such a scene And yet this young Palmyrean girl
loved nothing better than the chase and the records tell us that she
was a passionate hunter and thatshe pursued with ardor the wild
beasts of the desert and thought nothing of fatigue or peril

So through dense Armenian forests and along rugged mountain paths down
rockstrewn hillslopes and in green lowlying valleys the chase
swept on and one day in one of the pleasant glades which halfsun
and halfshadow stretch away to the Lebanon hills young Bath Zabbai
suddenly reined in her horse in full view of one of the typical hunting
scenes of those old days A young Arabian hunter had enticed a big
mountain lion into one of the strongmeshed nets of stout palm fibres
then used for such purposes His trained leopard or cheetah had drawn
the beast from his lair and by cunning devices had led him on until the
unfortunate lion was halfentrapped Just then with a sudden swoop a
great golden eagle dashed down upon the preoccupied cheetah and buried
his talons in the leopards head But the weight of his victim was
more than he had bargained for the cheetah with a quick upward dash
dislodged one of the great birds talons and turning as quickly
caught the disengaged leg in his sharp teeth At that instant the lion
springing at the struggling pair started the fastenings of the net
which falling upon the group held all three prisoners The eagle and
the lion thus ensnared sought to release themselves but only ensnared
themselves the more while the cunning cheetah versed in the knowledge
of the hunters net crept out from beneath the meshes as his master
raised them slightly and with bleeding head crawled to him for praise
and relief

Then the girl flushed with delight at this double capture galloped to
the spot and in that instant she recognized in the successful hunter
her cousin the exile

Well snared my Odhainat she said as the first exclamation of
surprise over she stood beside the brownfaced and sturdy young hunter
The Palmyrean leopard hath bravely trapped both the Roman eagle and
the Persian lion See is it not an omen from the gods Face valor with
valor and craft with craft O Odhainat Have you forgotten the vow in
your fathers palace full three years ago

Forgotten it Not he And then he told Bath Zabbai how in all his
wanderings he had kept their vow in mind and with that too her other
words of counsel Watch and Wait He told her that far and wide he
was known to all the Arabs of the desert and the Armenians of the hills
and how from sheikh to camelboy the tribes were ready to join with
Palmyra against both Rome and Persia

Your time will indeed come my Odhainat said the fearless girl
with proud looks and ringing voice See even thus our omen gives the
proof and she pointed to the net beneath whose meshes both eagle and
lion fluttering and panting lay wearied with their struggles while
the cheetah kept watch above them Now make your peace with Hairan
your brother return to Palmyra once again and still let us watch and
wait

Three more years passed Valerian Emperor of Rome leading his legions
to war with Sapor whom men called the Great King had fallen a
victim to the treachery and traps of the Persian monarch and was held
a miserable prisoner in the Persian capital where richly robed in the
purple of the Roman emperors and loaded with chains he was used by
the savage Persian tyrant as a living horseblock for the sport of an
equally savage court In Palmyra Hairan was dead and young Odhainat
his brother was now Septimus Odaenathusheadman of the city and to
all appearances the firm friend of Rome

There were great rejoicings in Palmyra when the wise Zenobiastill
scarce more than a girland the fearless young headman of the desert
republic were married in the marble city of the palmtrees and her
shrewd counsels brought still greater triumphs to Odaenathus and to
Palmyra

In the great marketplace or forum Odaenathus and Zenobia awaited the
return of their messengers to Sapor For the Great King having killed
and stuffed the captive Roman Emperor now turned his arms against the
Roman power in the east and destroying both Antioch and Emesa looked
with an evil eye toward Palmyra Zenobia remembering the omen of the
eagle and the lion repeated her counsel of facing craft with craft
and letters and gifts had been sent to Sapor asking for peace and
friendship There is a hurried entrance through the eastern gate of
the city and the messengers from the Palmyrean senate rush into the
Marketplace

Your presents to the Great King have been thrown into the river O
Odaenathus they reported and thus sayeth Sapor of Persia Who is
this Odaenathus that he should thus presume to write to his lord If he
would obtain mitigation of the punishment that awaits him let him fall
prostrate before the foot of our throne with his hands bound behind his
back Unless he doeth this he his family and his country shall surely
perish

Swift to wrath and swifter still to act Zenobia sprang to her feet
Face force with force Odaenathus Be strong and sure and Palmyra
shall yet humble the Persian

Her advice was taken Quickly collecting the troops of Palmyra and the
Arabs and Armenian who were his allies the fearless headman fell
upon the army of the haughty Persian king defeated and despoiled it
and drove it back to Persia As Gibbon the historian says The majesty
of Rome oppressed by a Persian was protected by an Arab of Palmyra

For this he was covered with favors by Rome made supreme commander in
the East and with Zenobia as his adviser and helper each year made
Palmyra stronger and more powerful

Here rightly the story of the girl Zenobia ends A woman now her
life fills one of the most brilliant pages of history While her husband
conquered for Rome in the north she in his absence governed so wisely
in the south as to insure the praise of all And when the time was ripe
and Rome ruled by weak emperors and harassed by wild barbarians was
in dire stress the childish vow of the boy and girl made years before
found fulfilment Palmyra was suddenly declared free from the dominion
of Rome and Odaenathus was acknowledged by senate and people as
Emperor and King of kings

But the hand of an assassin struck down the son as it had stricken
the father Zenobia ascending the throne of Palmyra declared herself
Zenobia Augusta the Empress of the East and after the manner of her
time extended her empire in every direction until as the record says
A small territory in the desert under the government of a woman
extended its conquests over many rich countries and several states
Zenobia lately confined to the barren plains about Palmyra now held
sway from Egypt in the south to the Bosphorus and the Black Sea in the
north

But a new emperor ruled in Rome Aurelian soldier and statesman
Rome he said shall never lose a province And then the struggle
for dominion in the East began The strength and power of Rome directed
by the Emperor himself at last triumphed Palmyra fell and Zenobia
after a most heroic defence of her kingdom was led a prisoner to Rome
Clad in magnificent robes loaded with jewels and with heavy chains
of gold she walked regal and undaunted still in the great triumphal
procession of her conqueror and disdaining to kill herself as did
Cleopatra and Dido she gave herself up to the nobler work of the
education and culture of her children and led for many years in her
villa at Tibur the life of a noble Roman matron

Such in brief is the story of Zenobia You must read for yourselves
the record of her later years as it stands in history if you would
know more of her grandeur in her days of power and her moral grandeur
in her days of defeat

And with Zenobia fell Palmyra Centuries of ruin and neglect have passed
over the once fairylike city of the Syrian oasis Her temples and
colonnades her monuments and archways and wonderful buildings are
prostrate and decayed and the site even of the glorious city has been
known to the modern world only within the last century But while time
lasts and the record of heroic deeds survives neither fallen column nor
ruined arch nor all the destruction and neglect of modern barbarism can
blot out the story of the life and worth of Bath Zabbai the brave girl
of the Syrian desert whom all the world honors as the noblest woman of
antiquityZenobia of Palmyra the dauntless Queen of the East




HELENA OF BRITAIN THE GIRL OF THE ESSEX FELLS

Afterward known as St Helena the mother of Constantine AD 255

Ever since that faroff day in the infancy of the world when lands
began to form and rivers to flow seaward the little river Colne has
wound its crooked way through the fertile fields of Essex eastward to
the broad North Sea

Through hillland and through moorland past Moyns and Great Yeldham
past Halstead and Chappel and the walls of Colchester turning now this
way and now that until it comes to Mersea Island and the sea the little
river flows today even as it sped along one pleasant summer morning
sixteen hundred and forty years ago when a little British princess
only fairly in her teens reclined in comfortable contentment in her
gilded barge and floated down the river from her fathers palace at
Colchester to the strand at Wivanloe

For this little girl of fourteen Helena the princess was a kings
daughter and according to all accounts a very bright and charming
girl besideswhich all princesses have not been Her father was Coel
second prince of Britain and king of that part of ancient England which
includes the present shires of Essex and of Suffolk about the river
Colne

Not a very large kingdom this but even as small as it was King Coel
did not hold it in undisputed sway For he was one of the tributary
princes of Britain in the days when Roman arms and Roman law and
Roman dress and Roman manners had place and power throughout England
from the Isle of Wight to the Northern highlands behind whose
forestcrowned hills those savage natives known as the Pictsthe
tattooed folkheld possession of ancient Scotland and defied the
eagles of Rome

The monotonous song of the rowers keeping time with each dip of the
broadbladed oars rose and fell in answer to the beats of the masters
silver baton and Helena too followed the measure with the tap tap of
her sandaled foot

Suddenly there shot out around one of the frequent turns in the river
the gleam of other oars the high prow of a larger galley and across
the water came the oarsong of a larger company of rowers Helena
started to her feet

Look Cleon she cried pointing eagerly towards the approaching
boat t is my fathers own trireme Why this haste to return thinkst
thou

I cannot tell little mistress replied the freedman Cleon her
galleymaster the king thy father must have urgent tidings to make
him return thus quickly to Camalodunum

Both the girl and the galleymaster spoke in Latin for the language of
the Empire was the language of those in authority or in official life
even in its remotest provinces and the galleymaster did but use the
name which the Roman lords of Britain had given to the prosperous city
on the Colne in which the native Prince King Coel had his courtthe
city which today is known under its later Saxon name of Colchester

It was indeed a curious state of affairs in England I doubt if many
of my girl and boy readers no matter how well they may stand in
their history classes have ever thought of the England of Hereward and
Ivanhoe of Paul Dombey and Tom Brown as a Roman land

And yet at the time when this little Flavia Julia Helena was sailing
down the river Colne the island of Britain in its southern section
at least was almost as Roman in manner custom and speech as was Rome
itself


For nearly five hundred years from the days of Caesar the conqueror
to those of Honorius the unfortunate was England or Britain as it was
called a Roman province broken only in its allegiance by the early
revolts of the conquered people or by the later usurpations of ambitious
and unprincipled governors

And at the date of our story in the year 255 AD the beautiful
island had so far grown out of the barbarisms of ancient Britain as to
have long since forgotten the gloomy rites and openair altars of the
Druids and all the halfsavage surroundings of those stern old priests

Everywhere Roman temples testified to the acceptance by the people of
the gods of Rome and little Helena herself each morning hung the altar
of the emperorgod Claudius with garlands in the stately temple which
had been built in his honor in her fathers palace town asked the
protection of Cybele the Heavenly Virgin and performed the rites
that the Empire demanded for the thousand gods of Rome

Throughout the land south of the massive wall which the great Emperor
Hadrian had stretched across the island from the mouth of the Solway to
the mouth of the Tyne the people themselves who had gathered into or
about the thirty growing Roman cities which the conquerors had founded
and beautified had become Roman in language religion dress and ways
while the educational influences of Rome always following the course of
her conquering eagles had planted schools and colleges throughout the
land and laid the foundation for that native learning which in later
years was to make the English nation so great and powerful

And what a mighty empire must have been that of Rome that in those
faroff days when rapid transit was unknown and steam and electricity
both lay dormant could have entered into the lives of two bright young
maidens so many leagues removed from one anotherZenobia the dusky
Palmyrean of the East and Helena the freshfaced English girl of the
West

But to such distant and widely separated confines had this power of the
vast Empire extended and to this thoughtful young princess drifting
down the winding English river the sense of Roman supremacy and power
would come again and again

For this charming young girlsaid later to have been the most
beautiful woman of her time in Englandthough reared to Roman ways and
Roman speech had too well furnished a mind not to think for herself
She spake so says the record many tongues and was replete with
piety The only child of King Coel her doting old father had given
her the finest education that Rome could offer She was even before she
grew to womanhood so we are told a fine musician a marvellous worker
in tapestry in hammered brass and pottery and was altogether as wise
and wonderful a young woman as even these later centuries can show

But for all this grand education she loved to hear the legends and
stories of her people that in various ways would come to her ears
either as the simple tales of her British nurse or in the wild songs of
the wandering bards or singers

As she listened to these she thought less of those crude and barbaric
ways of her ancestors that Rome had so vastly bettered than of their
national independence and freedom from the galling yoke of Rome and
as was natural she cherished the memory of Boadicea the warrior queen
and made a hero of the fiery young Caractacus

It is always so you know Every bright young imagination is apt to find
greater glories in the misty past or grander possibilities in a still
more misty future than in the too practical and prosaic present in which
both duty and destiny lie And so Helena the princess Leaning against
the soft cushions of her gilded barge had sighed for the days of the
oldtime British valor and freedom and even as she looked off toward
the approaching triareme she was wondering how she could awake to
thoughts of British glory her rather heavywitted father Coel the
Kingan hereditary prince of that ancient Britain in which he was now
alas but a tributary prince of the all too powerful Rome

Now old King Cole as Mother Goose tells usfor young Helenas
father was none other than the veritable old King Cole of our nursery
jinglewas a jolly old soul and a jolly old soul is very rarely an
independent or ambitious one So long as he could have his pipe and his
bowl not of course his long pipe of tobacco that all the Mother
Goose artists insist upon giving himbut the reed pipe upon which his
musicians playedso long in other words as he could live in ease and
comfort undisturbed in his enjoyment of the good things of life by his
Roman overlords he cared for no change Rome took the responsibility
and he took things easily But this very day while his daughter Helena
was floating down the river to meet him on the strand at Wivanloe he
was returning from an unsuccessful boarhunt in the Essex woods very
much out of sortscross because he had not captured the big boar he
had hoped to kill cross because his favorite musicians had been
confiscated by the Roman governor or propraetor at Londinium as
London was then called and still more cross because he had that day
received dispatches from Rome demanding a special and unexpected tax
levy or tribute to meet the necessary expenses of the new Emperor
Diocletian

Something else had happened to increase his ill temper His jolly old
soul vexed by the numerous crosses of the day was thrown into still
greater perplexity by the arrival just as he stood fretful and chafing
on the shore at Wivanloe of one who even now was with him
on the trireme bearing him company back to his palace at
CamolodunumCarausius the admiral

This Carausius the admiral was an especially vigorous valorous and
fiery young fellow of twentyone He was cousin to the Princess Helena
and a prince of the blood royal of ancient Britain Educated under the
strict military system of Rome he had risen to distinction in the naval
force of the Empire and was now the commanding officer in the northern
fleet that had its central station at Gessoriacum now Boulogne on the
northern coast of France He had chased and scattered the German pirates
who had so long ravaged the northern seas had been named by the Emperor
admiral of the north and was the especial pride as he was the dashing
young leader of the Roman sailors along the English Channel and the
German shores

The light barge of the princess approached the heavier boat of the king
her father At her signal the oarsmen drew up alongside and scarce
waiting for either boat to more than slacken speed the nimblefooted
girl sprang lightly to the deck of her fathers galley Then bidding
the obedient Cleon take her own barge back to the palace she hurried at
once and without question like the petted only child she was into the
highraised cabin at the stern where beneath the Roman standards sat
her father the king

Helena entered the apartment at a most exciting moment For there
facing her portly old father whose clouded face bespoke his troubled
mind stood her trimlybuilt young cousin Carausius the admiral bronzed
with his long exposure to the seablasts a handsome young viking and
in the eyes of the heroloving Helen very much of a hero because of his
acknowledged daring and his valorous deeds

Neither man seemed to have noticed the sudden entrance of the girl so
deep were they in talk

I tell thee uncle the hotheaded admiral was saying it is beyond
longer bearing This new emperorthis Diocletianwho is he to dare to
dictate to a prince of Britain A footsoldier of Illyria the son of
slaves and the client of three coward emperors an assassin so it
hath been said who from chief of the domestics hath become by his own
cunning Emperor of Rome And now hath he dared to accuse meme a free
Briton and a Roman citizen as well a prince and the son of princes
with having taken bribes from these German pirates whom I have
vanquished He hath openly said that I Carausius the admiral have
filled mine own coffers while neglecting the revenues of the state I
will not bear it I am a better king than he did I but have my own
just rights and even though he be Diocletian the Emperor he needeth to
think twice before he dare accuse a prince of Britain with bribetaking
and perjury

True enough good nephew said King Coel as the admiral strode up and
down before him angrily playing with the hilt of his short Roman sword
true enough and I too have little cause to love this lowborn emperor
He hath taken from me both my players and my gold when I can illy spare
either from my comfort or my necessities T is a sad pass for Britain
But Rome is mistress now What may we hope to do

The Princess Helena sprang to her fathers side her young face flushed
her small hand raised in emphasis Do cried she and the look of
defiance flamed on her fair young face Do Is it thou my father
thou my cousin princes of Britain both that ask so weak a question
O that I were a man What did that brave enemy of our house
Cassivellaunus do what Caractacus what the brave queen Boadicea
When the Roman drove them to despair they raised the standard of revolt
sounded their battle cries and showed the Roman that British freemen
could fight to the death for their country and their home And thus
should we do without fear or question and see here again in Britain a
victorious kingdom ruled once more by British kings

Nay nay my daughter said cautious King Coel your words are those
of an unthinking girl The power of Rome

But the Prince Carausius as the girls brave words rang out gave her
an admiring glance and crossing to where she stood laid his hand
approvingly upon her shoulder

The girl is right uncle he said breaking in upon the kings
cautious speech Too long have we bowed the neck to Roman tyranny We
free princes of Britain that we are have it even now in our power to
stand once again as altogether free The fleet is mine the people are
yours if you will but amuse them Our brothers are groaning under
the load of Roman tribute and are ripe to strike Raise the cry at
Camalodunum my uncle cry Havoc and death to Rome My fleet shall
pour its victorious sailors upon the coast the legions even now full
of British fighters shall flock to out united standards and we shall
ruleEmperors in the North even as do the Roman conquerors rule
Emperors in the South

Young blood often sways and leads in council and in action especially
when older minds are overcautious or sluggish in decision The words
of Carausius and Helena carried the day with Coel the king already
smarting under a sense of illtreatment by his Roman overlords

The standard of revolt was raised in Camalodunum The young admiral
hurried back to France to make ready his fleet while Coel the king
spurred on to action by the patriotic Helena who saw herself another
Boadiceathough in truth a younger and much fairer onegathered a
hasty following won over to his cause the Britishfilled legion in his
palacetown and descending upon the nearest Roman camps and stations
surprised captured scattered or brought over their soldiers and
proclaimed himself free from the yoke of Rome and supreme prince of
Britain

Ambition is always selfish Even when striving for the general good
there lies too often beneath this noble motive the still deeper one of
selfishness Carausius the admiral though determined upon kingly power
had no desire for a divided supremacy He was determined to be
sole emperor or none Crafty and unscrupulous although brave and
highspirited he deemed it wisest to delay his part of the compact
until he should see how it fared with his uncle the king and then
upon his defeat to climb to certain victory

He therefore sent to his uncle promises instead of men and when
summoned by the Roman governor to assist in putting down the revolt he
returned loyal answers but sent his aid to neither party

King Coel after his first successes knew that unaided he could not
hope to withstand the Roman force that must finally be brought against
him Though urged to constant action by his wise young daughter he
preferred to do nothing and satisfied with the acknowledgment of his
power in and about his little kingdom on the Colne he spent his time in
his palace with the musicians that he loved so well and the big bowl of
liquor that he loved it is to be feared quite as dearly

The musiciansthe pipers and the harperssang his praises and told of
his mighty deeds and no doubt their refrain was very much the same as
the one that has been preserved for us in the jingle of Mother Goose

 O none so rare as can compare
 With King Cole and his fiddlers three


But if the pleasureloving old king was listless young Helena was not
The misty records speak of her determined efforts and though it is hard
to understand how a girl of fifteen can do any thing toward successful
generalship much can be granted to a young lady who if the records
speak truth was even while a girl a Minerva in wisdom and not
deficient in statecraft

So while she advised with her fathers boldest captains and
strengthened so wisely the walls of ancient Colchester or Camalodunum
that traces of her work still remain as proof of her untiring zeal she
still cherished the hope of British freedom and release from Rome And
the loving old king deep in his pleasures still recognized the will
and wisdom of his valiant daughter and bade his artists make in her
honor a memorial that should ever speak of her valor And this memorial
lately unearthed and known as the Colchester Sphinx perpetuates the
lionlike qualities of a girl in her teens who dared withstand the
power of Imperial Rome

And still no help came from her cousin the admiral But one day a
galley speeding up the Colne brought this unsigned message to King Coel

To Coel Camalodunum Greeting

Save thyself Constantius the sallowfaced prefect of the Western
praetorians is even now on his way from Spain to crush thy revolt Save
thyself I wait Justice will come

Thou seest O daughter said King Coel as Helena read the craven
missive the end cometh as I knew it would Well man can but die And
with this philosophic reflection the jolly old soul only dipped his
red nose still deeper into his big bowl and bade his musicians play
their loudest and merriest

But Helena not deficient in statecraft thought for both She would
save her father her country and herself and shame her disloyal
cousin Discretion is the better part of valor Let us see how discreet
a little lady was this fair young Princess Helena

The legions came to Camalodunum Across Gaul and over the choppy channel
they came borne by the very galleys that were to have succored the
British king Up through the mouth of Thames they sailed and landing
at Londinium marched in close array along the broad Roman road that led
straight up to the gates of Camalodunum Before the walls of Camalodunum
was pitched the Roman camp and the British king was besieged in his own
palacetown

The Roman trumpets sounded before the gate of the beleaguered city and
the herald of the prefect standing out from his circle of guards cried
the summons to surrender

Coel of Britain traitor to the Roman people and to thy lord the
Emperor hear thou In the name of the Senate and People of Rome I
Constantius the prefect charge thee to deliver up to them ere this
days sun shall set this their City of Camalodunum and thine own
rebel body as well Which done they will in mercy pardon the crime of
treason to the city and will work their will and punishment only upon
theethe chief rebel And if this be not done within the appointed
time then will the walls of this their town of Camalodunum be
overthrown and thou and all thy people be given the certain death of
traitors

King Coel heard the summons and some spark of that very patriotism
that had inspired and incited his valiant little daughter flamed in his
heart He would have returned an answer of defiance I can at least die
with my people he said but young Helena interposed

Leave this to me my father she said As I have been the cause so
let me be the end of trouble Say to the prefect that in three hours
time the British envoy will come to his camp with the kings answer to
his summons

The old king would have replied otherwise but his daughters
entreaties and the counsels of his captains who knew the hopelessness
of resistance forced him to assent and his herald made answer
accordingly

Constantius the prefecta manly pleasant looking young commander
called Chlorus or the sallow from his pale facesat in his tent
within the Roman camp The three hours grace allowed had scarcely
expired when his sentry announced the arrival of the envoy of Coel of
Britain

Bid him enter said the prefect Then as the curtains of his tent
were drawn aside the prefect started in surprise for there before him
stood not the rugged form of a British fighting man but a fair young
girl who bent her graceful head in reverent obeisance to the youthful
representative of the Imperial Caesars

What wouldst thou with me maiden asked the prefect

I am the daughter of Coel of Britain said the girl and I am come to
sue for pardon and for peace

The Roman people have no quarrel with the girls of Britain said the
prefect Hath then King Coel fallen so low in state that a maiden must
plead for him

He hath not fallen at all O Prefect replied the girl proudly the
king my father would withstand thy force but that I his daughter
know the cause of this unequal strife and seek to make terms with the
victors

The girls fearlessness pleased the prefect for Constantius Chlorus was
a humane and gentle man fierce enough in fight but seeking never to
needlessly wound an enemy or lose a friend

And what are thy terms fair envoy of Britain he demanded

These O Prefect replied Helena If but thou wilt remove thy cohorts
to Londinium I pledge my fathers faith and mine that he will within
five days deliver to thee as hostage for his fealty myself and twenty
children of his councillors and captains And further I Helena the
princess will bind myself to deliver up to thee with the hostages the
chief rebel in this revolt and the one to whose counselling this strife
with Rome is due

Both the matter and the manner of the offered terms still further
pleased the prefect and he said Be it so Princess Then summoning
his lieutenant he said Conduct the envoy of Coel of Britain with all
courtesy to the gates of the the city and with a heralds escort the
girl returned to her father

Again the old king rebelled at the terms his daughter had made

I know the ways of Rome he said I know what their mercy meaneth
Thou shalt never go as hostage for my faith O daughter nor carry out
this hazardous plan

I have pledged my word and thine O King said Helena Surely a
Britons pledge should be as binding as a Romans

So she carried her point and in five days time she with twenty of
the boys and girls of Camalodunum went as hostages to the Roman camp in
London

Here be thy hostages fair Princess said Constantius the prefect as
he received the children and this is well But remember the rest of
thy compact Deliver to me now according to thy promise the chief
rebel against Rome

She is here O Prefect said the intrepid girl I am that
rebelHelena of Britain

The smile upon the prefects face changed to sudden sternness

Trifle not with Roman justice girl he said I demand the keeping of
thy word

It is kept replied the princess Helena of Britain is the cause and
motive of this revolt against Rome If it be rebellion for a free prince
to claim his own if it be rebellion for a prince to withstand for
the sake of his people the unjust demands of the conqueror if it be
rebellion for one who loveth her father to urge that father to valiant
deeds in defence of the liberties of the land over which he ruleth as
king then am I a rebel for I have done all these and only because
of my words did the king my father take up arms against the might and
power of Rome I am the chief rebel Do with me as thou wilt

And now the prefect saw that the girl spoke the truth and that she had
indeed kept her pledge

Thy father and his city are pardoned he announced after a few moments
of deliberation Remain thou here thou and thy companions as hostages
for Britain until such time as I shall determine upon the punishment
due to one who is so fierce a rebel against the power of Rome

So the siege of Camalodunum was raised and the bloodless rebellion
ended Constantius the prefect took up his residence for a while within
King Coels city and at last returned to his command in Gaul and Spain
well pleased with the spirit of the little maiden whom so he claimed
he still held in his power as the prisoner of Rome

Constantius the prefect came again to Britain and with a greater
following fully ten years after King Coels revolt for now again
rebellion was afoot in the island province

Carausius the admiral biding his time sought at last to carry out his
scheme of sole supremacy Sailing with his entire warfleet to Britain
he won the legions to his side proclaimed himself Emperor of Britain
and defied the power of Rome

So daring and successful was his move that Rome for a time was
powerless Carausius was recognized as associate emperor by Rome
until such time as she should be ready to punish his rebellion and for
seven years he reigned as emperor of Britain

But ere this came to pass Helena the princess had gone over to Gaul
and had become the wife of Constantius the prefectSince only thus
said he may I keep in safe custody this prisoner of Rome

The imperial power of Carausius was but shortlived Crafty himself
he fell a victim to the craft of others and the sword of Allectus
his chief minister and most trusted confidant ended his life when
once again the power of Rome seemed closing about the little kingdom of
Britain

Constantius became governor of Britain and finally caesar and emperor
But long before that day arrived the Princess Helena had grown into a
loyal Roman wife and mother dearly loving her little son Constantine
who in after years became the first and greatest Christian emperor of
Rome

She bestowed much loving care upon her native province of Britain She
became a Christian even before her renowned son had his historic
vision of the flaming cross When more than eighty years old she made a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land There she did many good and kindly deeds
erected temples above the Sepulchre of the Saviour at his birthplace
at Bethlehem and on the Mount of Olives She is said also to have
discovered upon Calvary the cross upon which had suffered and died the
Saviour she had learned to worship

Beloved throughout her long and useful life she was canonized after her
death and is now recognized one of the saints of the Romish church

Today in the city of London you may see the memorial church reared to
her memorythe Church of Great St Helena in Bishopgate A loving
noble wonderful and zealous woman she is a type of the brave young
girlhood of the long ago and however much of fiction there may be
mingled with the fact of her lifestory she was we may feel assured
all that the chroniclers have claimed for herone of the grandest
women of the earlier centuries




PULCHERIA of CONSTANTINOPLE THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN HORN

Afterward known as Pulcheria Augusta Empress of the East AD 413

There was trouble and confusion in the imperial palace of Theodosius
the Little Emperor of the East Now this Theodosius was called the
Little because though he bore the name of his mighty grandfather
Theodosius the Great emperor of both the East and West he had as yet
done nothing worthy any other title than that of the Little or the
Child For Theodosius emperor though he was called was only a boy of
twelve and not a very bright boy at that

His father Arcadius the emperor and his mother Eudoxia the empress
were dead and in the great palace at Constantinople in this year
of grace 413 Theodosius the boy emperor and his three sisters
Pulcheria Marina and Arcadia alone were left to uphold the tottering
dignity and the empty name of the once mighty Empire of the East which
their great ancestors Constantine and Theodosius had established and
strengthened

And now there was confusion in the imperial palace for word came in
haste from the Dacian border that Ruas king of the Huns sweeping down
from the east was ravaging the lands along the Upper Danube and with
his host of barbarous warriors was defeating the legions and devastating
the lands of the empire

The wise Anthemius prefect of the east and governor or guardian of
the young emperor was greatly disturbed by the tidings of this new
invasion Already he had repelled at great cost the first advance of
these terrible Huns and had quelled into a sort of half submission the
less ferocious followers of Ulpin the Thracian but now he knew that his
armies along the Danube were in no condition to withstand the hordes of
Huns that pouring in from distant Siberia were following the lead
of Ruas their king for plunder and booty and were even now encamped
scarce two hundred and fifty miles from the seven gates and the triple
walls of splendid Constantinople

Turbaned Turks mosques and minarets muftis and cadis veiled eastern
ladies Mohammedains and muezzins Arabian Nights and attar of roses
bazars dogs and donkeysthese I suppose are what Constantinople
suggests whenever its name is mentioned to any girl or boy of
todaythe capital of modern Turkey the city of the Sublime Porte
But the greatest glory of Constantinople was away back in the early days
before the time of Mohammed or of the Crusaders when it was the centre
of the Christian religion the chief and gorgeous capital of a Christian
empire and the residence of Christian emperorsfrom the days of
Constantine the conqueror to those of Justinian the lawgiver and of
Irene the empress It was the metropolis of the eastern half of the
great Roman Empire and during this period of over five hundred years
all the wealth and treasure of the east poured into Constantinople
while all the glories of the empire even the treasures of old Rome
itself were drawn upon to adorn and beautify this rival city by the
Golden Horn And so in the days of Theodosius the Little the court of
Constantinople although troubled with fear of a barbarian invasion
and attack glittered with all the gorgeousness and display of the most
magnificent empire in the world

In the great daphne or central space of the imperial palace the
prefect Anthemius with the young emperor the three princesses and
their gorgeously arrayed nobles and attendants awaited one day the
envoys of Ruas the Hun who sought lands and power within the limits of
the empire

They came at lastgreat fiercelooking fellows not at all pleasant
to contemplatebigboned broadshouldered flatnosed swarthy
and smalleyed with warcloaks of shaggy skins leathern armor
wolfcrowned helmets and barbaric decorations and the royal children
shrunk from them in terror even as they watched them with wondering
curiosity Imperial guards gleaming in golden armor accompanied them
while with the envoys came also as escort a small retinue of Hunnish
spearmen And in the company of these the Princess Pulcheria noted a
lad of ten or twelve yearsshort swarthy bigheaded and flatnosed
like his brother barbarians but with an air of open and hostile
superiority that would not be moved even by all the glow and glitter of
an imperial court

Then Eslaw the chief of the envoys of King Ruas the Hun made known his
masters demands So much land so much treasure so much in the way of
concession and power over the lands along the Danube or Ruas the king
would sweep down with his warriors and lay waste the cities and lands
of the empire

These be bold words said Anthemius the prefect And what if our lord
the emperor shall say thee nay

But ere the chief of the envoys could reply the lad whose presence
in the escort the Princess Pulcheria had noted sprang into the circle
before the throne brandishing his long spear in hot defiance

Dogs and children of dogs ye dare not say us nay he cried harshly
Except we be made the friends and allies of the emperor and are given
full store of southern gold and treasure Ruas the king shall overturn
these your palaces and make you all captives and slaves It shall be
war between you and us forever Thus saith my spear

And as he spoke he dashed his long spear upon the floor until the
mosaic pavement rang again

Boy emperor and princesses prefect and nobles and imperial guards
sprang to their feet as the spear clashed on the pavement and even
the barbarian envoys while they smiled grimly at their young comrades
energy pulled him hastily back

But ere the prefect Anthemius could sufficiently master his astonishment
to reply the young Princess Pulcheria faced the savage envoys and
pointing to the cause of the disturbance asked calmly

Who is this brawling boy and what doth he here in the palace of the
emperor

And the boy made instant and defiant answer

I am Attila the son of Mundzuk kinsman to Ruas the king and deadly
foe to Rome

Good Anthemius said the clear calm voice of the unterrified girl
were it not wise to tell this wild young prince from the northern
forest that the great emperor hath gold for his friends but only iron
for his foes T is ever better to be friend than foe Bid I pray that
the arras of the Hippodrome be parted and let our guests see the might
and power of our arms

With a look of pleased surprise at this bold stroke of the Princess the
prefect clapped his hands in command and the heavily brocaded curtain
that screened the gilded columns parted as if by unseen hands and the
Hunnish envoys with a gaze of stolid wonder looked down upon the great
Hippodrome of Constantinople

It was a vast enclosure spacious enough for the marshalling of an
army Around its sides ran tiers of marble seats and all about it rose
gleaming statues of marble of bronze of silver and of goldAugustus
and the emperors gods and goddesses of the old pagan days heroes of
the eastern and western empires The bright oriental sun streamed down
upon it and as the trumpets sounded from beneath the imperial balcony
there filed into the arena the glittering troops of the empire gorgeous
in color and appointments with lofty crests and gleaming armor with
shimmering speartips prancing horses towering elephants and mighty
engines of war and siege with archers and spearmen with sounding
trumpets and swaying standards and high over all the purple labarum
woven in gold and jewelsthe sacred banner of Constantine Marching
and countermarching around and around and in and out until it seemed
wellnigh endless the martial procession passed before the eyes of the
northern barbarians watchful of every movement eager as children to
witness this royal review

These are but as a handful of dust amid the sands of the sea to the
troops of the empire said the prefect Anthemius when the glittering
rearguard had passed from the Hippodrome And the Princess Pulcheria
added And these O men from the north are to help and succor the
friends of the great emperor even as they are for the terror and
destruction of his foes Bid the messengers from Ruas the king consider
good Anthemius whether it were not wiser for their master to be the
friend rather than the foe of the emperor Ask him whether it would not
be in keeping with his valor and his might to be made one of the great
captains of the empire with a yearly stipend of many pounds of gold as
the recompense of the emperor for his services and his love

Again the prefect looked with pleasure and surprise upon this wise young
girl of fifteen who had seen so shrewdly and so well the way to the
hearts of these northern barbarians to whom gold and warlike display
were as meat and drink

You hear the words of this wise young maid he said Would it not
please Ruas the king to be the friend of the emperor a general of the
empire and the acceptor on each recurring season of the Circensian
games of full two hundred pounds of gold as recompense for service and
friendship

Say rather three hundred pounds said Eslaw the chief of the
envoys and our master may perchance esteem it wise and fair

Nay it is not for the great emperor to chaffer with his friends said
Pulcheria the princess Bid that the stipend be fixed at three hundred
and fifty pounds of gold good Anthemius and let our guests bear to
Ruas the king pledges and tokens of the emperors friendship

And bid too that they do leave yon barbarian boy at our court as
hostage of their faith demanded young Theodosius the emperor now
speaking for the first time and making a most stupid blunder at a
critical moment

For with a sudden start of revengeful indignation young Attila the
Hun turned to the boy emperor I will be no mans hostage he cried
Freely I came freely will I go Come down from thy bauble of a chair
and thou and I will try even in your circus yonder which is the better
boy and which should rightly be hostage for faith and promise given

How now exclaimed the boy emperor altogether unused to such
uncourtierlike language this to me And the hasty young Hun
continued

Ay this and more I tell thee boy that were I Ruas the king the
grass should never grow where the hoofs of my warhorse trod Scythia
should be mine Persia should be mine Rome should be mine And look
you sir emperor the time shall surely come when the king of the Huns
shall be content not with paltry tribute and needless office but with
naught but Roman treasure and Roman slaves

But into this torrent of words came Pulcherias calm voice again Nay
good Attila and nay my brother and my lord she said T were not
between friends and allies to talk of tribute nor of slaves nor yet
of hostage Freely didst thou come and as freely shalt thou go and let
this pledge tell of friendship between Theodosius the emperor and Ruas
the king And with a step forward she flung her own broad chain of
gold around the stout and swarthy neck of the defiant young Attila

So through a girls ready tact and quiet speech was the terror of
barbarian invasion averted Ruas the Hun rested content for years with
his annual salary of three hundred and fifty pounds of gold or over
seventy thousand dollars and his title of General of the Empire while
not for twenty years did the hotheaded young Attila make good his
threat against the Roman power

Anthemius the prefect like the wise man he was recognized the worth
of the young Princess Pulcheria he saw how great was her influence over
her brother the emperor and noted with astonishment and pleasure her
words of wisdom and her rare commonsense

Rule thou in my place O Princess he said soon after this interview
with the barbarian envoys Thou alone of all in this broad empire art
best fitted to take lead and direction in the duties of its governing

Pulcheria though a wise young girl was prudent and conscientious

Such high authority is not for a girl like me good Anthemius she
replied Rather let me shape the ways and the growth of the emperor
my brother and teach him how best to maintain himself in a deportment
befitting his high estate so that he may become a wise and just
ruler but do thou bear sway for him until such time as he may take the
guidance on himself

Nay not so Princess the old prefect said She who can shape the
ways of a boy may guide the will of an empire Be thou then Regent and
Augusta and rule this empire as becometh the daughter of Arcadius and
the granddaughter of the great Theodosius

And as he desired so it was decided The Senate of the East decreed
it and in long procession over flowerstrewn pavements and through
gorgeously decorated streets with the trumpets sounding their loudest
with swaying standards and rank upon rank of imperial troops with
great officers of the government and throngs of palace attendants
this young girl of sixteen on the fourth day of July in the year 414
proceeded to the Church of the Holy Apostles and was there publicly
proclaimed Pulcheria Augusta Regent of the East solemnly accepting the
trust as a sacred and patriotic duty

And not many days after before the high altar of this same Church
of the Holy Apostles Pulcheria the princess stood with her younger
sisters Arcadia and Marina and with all the impressive ceremonial
of the Eastern Church made a solemn vow to devote their lives to the
keeping of their fathers heritage and the assistance of their only
brother to forswear the world and all its allurements never to marry
and to be in all things faithful and constant to each other in this
their promise and their pledge

And they were faithful and constant The story of those three determined
young maidens yet scarcely in their teens reads almost like a page
from Tennysons beautiful poem The Princess with which many of my
girl readers are doubtless familiar The young regent and her sisters
with their train of attendant maidens renounced the vanity of
dresswearing only plain and simple robes they spent their time
in making garments for the poor and embroidered work for church
decorations and with song and prayer and frugal meals interspersed
with frequent fasts they kept their vow to forswear the world and its
allurements in an altogether strict and monotonous manner Of course
this style of living is no more to be recommended to healthy
hearty funloving girls of fifteen than is its extreme of gayety and
indulgence but it had its effect in those bad old days of dissipation
and excess and the simplicity and soberness of this wise young girls
life in the very midst of so much power and luxury made even the worst
elements in the empire respect and honor her

It would be interesting did space permit to sketch at length some
of the devisings and doings of this girl regent of sixteen She
superintended with extraordinary wisdom says the old chronicler
Sozemon the transactions of the Roman government and afforded the
spectacle says Ozanam a later historian of a girlish princess of
sixteen granddaughter and sole inheritor of the genius and courage of
Theodosius the Great governing the empires of the east and west and
being proclaimed on the death of her brother Augusta Imperatrix and
mistress of the world

This last eventthe death of Theodosius the Youngeroccurred in
the year 449 and Pulcheria ascended the golden throne of
Constantinoplethe first woman that ever ruled as sole empress of the
Roman world

She died July 18 453 That same year saw the death of her youthful
acquaintance Attila the Hun that fierce barbarian whom men had called
the Scourge of God His mighty empire stretched from the great wall
of China to the Western Alps but though he ravaged the lands of both
eastern and western Rome he seems to have been so managed or controlled
by the wise and peaceful measures of the girl regent that his
destroying hordes never troubled the splendid city by the Golden Horn
which offered so rare and tempting a booty

It is not given to the girls of today to have any thing like the
magnificent opportunities of the young Pulcheria But duty in many a
form faces them again and again while not unfrequently the occasion
comes for sacrifice of comfort or for devotion to a trust To all such
the example of this fair young princess of old Constantinople who
fifteen centuries ago saw her duty plainly and undertook it simply and
without hesitation comes to strengthen and incite and the girl who
feels herself overwhelmed by responsibility or who is fearful of her
own untried powers may gather strength courage wisdom and will from
the story of this historic girl of the long agothe wise young Regent
of the East Pulcheria of Constantinople




CLOTILDA OF BURGANDY THE GIRL OF THE FRENCH VINYARDS

Afterward known as St Clotilda the first Queen of France AD
485

It was little more than fourteen hundred years ago in the year of our
Lord 485 that a little girl crouched trembling and terrified at the
feet of a pitying priest in the palace of the kings of Burgundy There
has been many a sad little maid of ten before and since the days of
the fairhaired Princess Clotilda but surely none had greater cause for
terror and tears than she For her cruel uncle Gundebald waging war
against his brother Chilperic the rightful king of Burgundy had with a
band of savage followers burst into his brothers palace and after the
fierce and relentless fashion of those cruel days had murdered King
Chilperic the father of little Clotilda the queen her mother and
the young princes her brothers and was now searching for her and her
sister Sedelenda to kill them also

Poor Sedelenda had hidden away in some other faroff corner but even as
Clotilda hung for protection to the robe of the good strangerpriest Ugo
of Rheims whom the king her father had lodged in the palace on his
homeward journey from Jerusalem the clash of steel drew nearer and
nearer Through the corridor came the rush of feet the arras in the
doorway was rudely flung aside and the poor childs fierce pursuers
with her cruel uncle at their head rushed into the room

Hollo Here hides the game he cried in savage exultation Thrust her
away Sir Priest or thou diest in her stead Not one of the tyrants
brood shall live I say it

And who art thou to judge of life or death demanded the priest
sternly as he still shielded the trembling child

I am Gundebald King of Burgundy by the grace of mine own good sword
and the right of succession was the reply Trifle not with me Sir
Priest but thrust away the child She is my lawful prize to do with as
I will Ho Sigebert drag her forth

Quick as a flash the brave priest stepped before the cowering child
and with one hand still resting protectingly on the girls fair hair
he raised the other in stern and fearless protest and boldly faced the
murderous throng

Back men of blood he cried Back Nor dare to lay hand on this
young maid who hath here sought sanctuary1

1 Under the Goths and Franks the protection of churches and priests
when extended to persons in peril was called the right of sanctuary
and was respected even by the fiercest of pursuers


Fierce and savage men always respect bravery in others There was
something so courageous and heroic in the act of that single priest
in thus facing a ferocious and determined band in defence of a
little girlfor girls were but slightingly regarded in those faroff
daysthat it caught the savage fancy of the cruel king And this
joined with his respect for the Churchs right of sanctuary and with
the lessening of his thirst for blood now that he had satisfied his
first desire for revenge led him to desist

So be it then he said lowering his threatening sword I yield her
to thee Sir Priest Look to her welfare and thine own Surely a girl
can do no harm

But King Gundebald and his house lived to learn how far wrong was that
unguarded statement For the very lowering of the murderous sword that
thus brought life to the little Princess Clotilda meant the downfall of
the kingdom of Burgundy and the rise of the great and victorious nation
of France The memories of even a little maid of ten are not easily
blotted out

Her sister Sedelenda had found refuge and safety in the convent of
Ainay near at hand and there too Clotilda would have gone but her
uncle the new king said No the maidens must be forever separated
He expressed a willingness however to have the Princess Clotilda
brought up in his palace which had been her fathers and requested
the priest Ugo of Rheims to remain awhile and look after the girls
education In those days a kings request was a command and the good
Ugo though stern and brave in the face of real danger was shrewd
enough to know that it was best for him to yield to the kings wishes
So he continued in the palace of the king looking after the welfare
of his little charge until suddenly the girl took matters into her own
hands and decided his future and her own

The kingdom of Burgundy in the days of the Princess Clotilda was
a large tract of country now embraced by Southern France and Western
Switzerland It had been given over by the Romans to the Goths who had
invaded it in the year 413 It was a land of forest and vineyards
of fair valleys and sheltered hillsides and of busy cities that the
fostering hand of Rome had beautified while through its broad domain
the Rhone pure and sparkling swept with a rapid current from Swiss
lake and glacier southward to the broad and beautiful Mediterranean
Lyons was its capital and on the hill of Fourviere overlooking the
city below it rose the marble palace of the Burgundian kings near to
the spot where today the ruined forum of the old Roman days is still
shown to tourists

It had been a palace for centuries Roman governors of Imperial Gaul
had made it their headquarters and their home three Roman emperors had
cooed and cried as babies within its walls and it had witnessed also
many a feast and foray and the changing fortunes of Roman Gallic and
Burgundian conquerors and overlords But it was no longer home to the
little Princess Clotilda She thought of her father and mother and of
her brothers the little princes with whom she had played in this very
palace as it now seemed to her so many years ago And the more she
feared her cruel uncle the more did she desire to go far far away from
his presence So after thinking the whole matter over as little girls
of ten can sometimes think she told her good friend Ugo the priest
of her fathers youngest brother Godegesil who ruled the dependent
principality of Geneva far up the valley of the Rhone

Yes child I know the place said Ugo A fair city indeed on the
blue and beautiful Lake Lemanus walled in by mountains and rich in
corn and vineyards

Then let us fly thither said the girl My uncle Godegesil I know
will succor us and I shall be freed from my fears of King Gundebald

Though it seemed at first to the good priest only a childs desire he
learned to think better of it when he saw how unhappy the poor girl was
in the hated palace and how slight were her chances for improvement
And so one fair spring morning in the year 486 the two slipped quietly
out of the palace and by slow and cautious stages with help from
friendly priests and nuns and frequent rides in the heavy oxwagons
that were the only means of transport other than horseback they finally
reached the old city of Geneva

And on the journey the good Ugo had made the road seem less weary and
the lumbering oxwagons less jolty and painful by telling his
bright young charge of all the wonders and relics he had seen in his
journeyings in the East but especially did the girl love to hear him
tell of the boy king of the Franks Hlodowig or Clovis who lived in
the priests own boyhood home of Tournay in faroff Belgium and who
though so brave and daring was still a pagan when all the world was
fast becoming Christian And as Clotilda listened she wished that she
could turn this brave young chief away from his heathen deities Thor
and Odin to the worship of the Christians God and revolving strange
fancies in her mind she determined what she would do when she grew
upas many a girl since her day has determined But even as they
reached the fair city of Genevathen half Roman half Gallic in its
buildings and its lifethe wonderful news met them how this boyking
Clovis sending a challenge to combat to the prefect Syagrius the last
of the Roman governors had defeated him in a battle at Soissons and
broken forever the power of Rome in Gaul

War which is never any thing but terrible was doubly so in those
savage days and the plunder of the captured cities and homesteads
was the chief return for which the barbarian soldiers followed their
leaders But when the Princess Clotilda heard how even in the midst of
his burning and plundering the young Frankish chief spared some of the
fairest Christian churches he became still more her hero and again the
desire to convert him from paganism and to revenge her fathers murder
took shape in her mind For devout and good though she was
this excellent little maiden of the year 485 was by no means the
gentlehearted girl of 1888 and like most of the world about her had
but two desires to become a good churchhelper and to be revenged on
her enemies Certainly fourteen centuries of progress and education
have made us more loving and less vindictive

But now that the good priest Ugo of Rheims saw that his own home land
was in trouble he felt that there lay his duty And Godegesil the
underking of Geneva feeling uneasy alike from the nearness of this
boy conqueror and the possible displeasure of his brother and overlord
King Gundebald declined longer to shelter his niece in his palace at
Geneva

And why may I not go with you the girl asked of Ugo but the old
priest knew that a conquered and plundered land was no place to which
to convey a young maid for safety and the princess therefore found
refuge among the sisters of the church of St Peter in Geneva And here
she passed her girlhood as the record says in works of piety and
charity

So four more years went by In the north the boy chieftain reaching
manhood had been raised aloft on the shields of his fairhaired and
longlimbed followers and with many a hael and shout had been
proclaimed King of the Franks In the south the young Princess
Clotilda now nearly sixteen had washed the feet of pilgrims
ministered to the poor and after the manner of her day had proved
herself a zealous churchworker in that lowroofed convent near the
old church of St Peter high on that same hill in Geneva where today
hemmed in by narrow streets and tall houses the cathedral of St Peter
twice rebuilded since Clotildas time overlooks the quaint city the
beautiful lake of Geneva and the rushing Rhone and sees across the
valley of the Arve the gray and barren rocks of the Petit Seleve and the
distant snows of Mont Blanc

One bright summer day as the young princess passed into the hospitium
or guestroom for poor pilgrims attached to the convent she saw there
a stranger dressed in rags He had the wallet and staff of a mendicant
or begging pilgrim and coming toward her he asked for charity in the
name of the blessed St Peter whose church thou servest

The young girl brought the pilgrim food and then according to the
custom of the day kneeling on the earthen floor she began to bathe
his feet But as she did so the pilgrim bending forward said in a low
voice

Lady I have great matters to announce to thee if thou deign to permit
me to reveal them

Pilgrims in those days were frequently made the bearers of special
messages between distant friends but this poor young orphan
princess could think of no one from whom a message to her might come
Nevertheless she simply said Say on In the same low tone the beggar
continued Clovis King of the Franks sends thee greeting

The girl looked up now thoroughly surprised This beggar must be
a madman she thought But the eyes of the pilgrim looked at her
reassuringly and he said In token whereof he sendeth thee this ring
by me his confidant and comitatus1 Aurelian of Soissons

1 One of the kings special bodyguard from which comes the title
comp count


The Princess Clotilda took as if in a dream the ring of transparent
jacinth set in solid gold and asked quietly

What would the king of the Franks with me

The king my master hath heard from the holy Bishop Remi and the
good priest Ugo of thy beauty and discreetness replied Aurelian and
likewise of the sad condition of one who is the daughter of a royal
line He bade me use all my wit to come nigh to thee and to say that
if it be the will of the gods he would fain raise thee to his rank by
marriage

Those were days of swift and sudden surprises when kings made up their
minds in royal haste and princesses were not expected to be surprised
at whatever they might hear And so we must not feel surprised to learn
that all the dreams of her younger days came into the girls mind and
that as the record states she accepted the ring with great joy

Return promptly to thy lord she said to the messenger and bid him
if he would fain unite me to him in marriage to send messengers without
delay to demand me of my uncle King Gundebald and let those same
messengers take me away in haste so soon as they shall have obtained
permission

For this wise young princess knew that her uncles word was not to be
long depended upon and she feared too that certain advisers at her
uncles court might counsel him to do her harm before the messengers of
King Clovis could have conducted her beyond the borders of Burgundy

Aurelian still in his pilgrims disguise for he feared discovery in a
hostile country hastened back to King Clovis who the record says was
pleased with his success and with Clotildas notion and at once sent a
deputation to Gundebald to demand his niece in marriage

As Clotilda foresaw her uncle stood in too much dread of this fierce
young conqueror of the north to say him nay And soon in the palace at
Lyons so full of terrible memories to this orphan girl the courteous
Aurelian now no longer in beggars rags but gorgeous in white silk and
a flowing sagum or mantle of vermilion publicly engaged himself
as the representative of King Clovis to the Princess Clotilda and
according to the curious custom of the time cemented the engagement by
giving to the young girl a sou and a denier1

1 Two pieces of old French coin equalling about a cent and a mill in
American money


Now deliver the princess into our hand O king said the messenger
that we may take her to King Clovis who waiteth for us even now at
Chalons to conclude these nuptials

So almost before he knew what he was doing King Gundebald had bidden
his niece farewell and the princess with her escort of Frankish
spears was rumbling away in a clumsy basterne or covered oxwagon
toward the frontier of Burgundy

But the slowmoving oxwagon by no means suited the impatience of this
shrewd young princess She knew her uncle the king of Burgundy too
well When once he was roused to action he was fierce and furious

Good Aurelian she said at length to the kings ambassador who rode
by her side if that thou wouldst take me into the presence of thy
lord the king of the Franks let me descend from this carriage mount
me on horseback and let us speed hence as fast as we may for never in
this carriage shall I reach the presence of my lord the king

And none too soon was her advice acted upon for the counsellors of
King Gundebald noticing Clotildas anxiety to be gone concluded that
after all they had made a mistake in betrothing her to King Clovis

Thou shouldst have remembered my lord they said that thou didst
slay Clotildas father her mother and the young princes her brothers
If Clotilda become powerful be sure she will avenge the wrong thou hast
wrought her

And forthwith the king sent off an armed band with orders to bring back
both the princess and the treasure he had sent with her as her marriage
portion But already the princess and her escort were safely across the
Seine where in the Campania or plaincountrylater known as the
province of Champagneshe met the king of the Franks

I am sorry to be obliged to confess that the first recorded desire of
this beautiful brave and devout young maiden when she found herself
safely among the fierce followers of King Clovis was a request for
vengeance But we must remember girls and boys that this is a story of
halfsavage days when as I have already said the desire for revenge on
ones enemies was common to all

From the midst of his skinclad and greenrobed guards and nobles young
Clovisin a dress of crimson and gold and milkwhite silk and
with his yellow hair coiled in a great topknot on his uncovered
headadvanced to meet his bride

My lord king said Clotilda the bands of the king of Burgundy
follow hard upon us to bear me off Command I pray thee that these
my escort scatter themselves right and left for twoscore miles and
plunder and burn the lands of the king of Burgundy

Probably in no other way could this wise young girl of seventeen have so
thoroughly pleased the fierce and warlike young king He gladly ordered
her wishes to be carried out and the plunderers forthwith departed to
carry out the royal command

So her troubles were ended and this prince and princessHlodowig
or Clovis meaning the warrior youth and Hlodohilde or Clotilda
meaning the brilliant and noble maidin spite of the wicked uncle
Gundebald were married at Soissons in the year 493 and as the fairy
stories say lived happily together ever after

The record of their later years has no place in this sketch of the
girlhood of Clotilda but it is one of the most interesting and dramatic
of the oldtime historic stories The dream of that sad little princess
in the old convent at Geneva to make her boyhero a Christian and to
be revenged on the murderer of her parents was in time fulfilled For
on Christmasday in the year 493 the young king and three thousand of
his followers were baptized amid gorgeous ceremonial in the great church
of St Martin at Rheims

The story of the young queens revenge is not to be told in these pages
But though terrible it is only one among the many tales of vengeance
that show us what fierce and cruel folk our ancestors were in the days
when passion instead of love ruled the hearts of men and women and
of boys and girls as well and how favored are we of this nineteenth
century in all the peace and prosperity and home happiness that
surround us

But from this conversion as also from this revenge came the great
power of Clovis and Clotilda for ere his death in the year 511 he
brought all the land under his sway from the Rhine to the Rhone the
ocean and the Pyrenees he was hailed by his people with the old Roman
titles of Consul and Augustus and reigned victorious as the first king
of France Clotilda after years of wise counsel and charitable works
upon which her determination for revenge seems to be the only stain
died long after her husband in the year 545 and today in the city of
Paris which was even then the capital of new France the church of St
Clotilda stands as her memorial while her marble statue may be seen by
the traveller in the great palace of the Luxembourg

A typical girl of those harsh old days of the long agoloving
and generous toward her friends unforgiving and revengeful to her
enemiesreared in the midst of cruelty and of charity she did her
duty according to the light given her made France a Christian nation
and so helped on the progress of civilization Certainly a place among
the worlds historic girls may rightly be accorded to this fairhaired
young princess of the summerland of France the beautiful Clotilda of
Burgundy




WOO OF HWANGHO THE GIRL OF THE YELLOW RIVER

Afterwards the Great Empress Woo of China AD 635

Thomas the Nestorian had been in many lands and in the midst of many
dangers but he had never before found himself in quite so
unpleasant a position as now Six ugly Tartar horsemen with very
uncomfortablelooking spears and appalling shouts and mounted on their
swift Kirghiz ponies were charging down upon him while neither the
rushing Yellow River on the right hand nor the steep dirtcliffs on the
left could offer him shelter or means of escape These dirtcliffs
or loess to give them their scientific name are remarkable banks of
brownishyellow loam found largely in Northern and Western China and
rising sometimes to a height of a thousand feet Their peculiar yellow
tinge makes every thing look hwang or yellowand hence yellow is
a favorite color among the Chinese So for instance the emperor is
Hwangtithe Lord of the Yellow Land the imperial throne is the
Hwangwei or yellow throne of China the great river formerly
spelled in your school geographies Hoangho is Hwangho the yellow
river etc

These hwang cliffs or dirtcliffs are full of caves and crevices
but the good priest could see no convenient cave and he had therefore
no alternative but to boldly face his fate and like a brave man calmly
meet what he could not avoid

But just as he had singled out as his probable captor one peculiarly
unattractivelooking horseman whose crimson sheepskin coat and long
horsetail plume were streaming in the wind and just as he had braced
himself to meet the onset against the great loess or dirtcliff he
felt a twitch at his black upper robe and a low voicea girls he was
confidentsaid quickly

Look not before nor behind thee good Olopun but trust to my word and
give a backward leap

Thomas the Nestorian had learned two valuable lessons in his much
wandering about the earthnever to appear surprised and always to be
ready to act quickly So knowing nothing of the possible results of
his action but feeling that it could scarcely be worse than death from
Tartar spears he leaped back as bidden

The next instant he found himself flat upon his back in one of the
lowceiled cliff caves that abound in Western China while the screen
of vines that had concealed its entrance still quivered from his fall
Picking himself up and breathing a prayer of thanks for his deliverance
he peered through the leafy doorway and beheld in surprise six much
astonished Tartar robbers regarding with looks of puzzled wonder a
defiant little Chinese girl who had evidently darted out of the cave as
he had tumbled in She was facing the enemy as boldly as had he and
her little almond eyes fairly danced with mischievous delight at their
perplexity

At once he recognized the child She was Woo the highspirited or
dauntless one the bright young girl whom he had often noticed in the
throng at his missionhouse in TungChowthe little city by the Yellow
River where her father the bannerman held guard at the Dragon Gate

He was about to call out to the girl to save herself when with a
sudden swoop the Tartar whom he had braced himself to resist bent
in his saddle and made a dash for the child But agile little Woo
was quicker than the Tartar horseman With a nimble turn and a sudden
spring she dodged the Tartars hand darted under his ponys legs
and with a shrill laugh of derision sprang up the sharp incline and
disappeared in one of the many cliff caves before the now doubly baffled
horsemen could see what had become of her

With a grunt of discomfiture and disgust the Tartar riders turned their
ponies heads and galloped off along the road that skirted the yellow
waters of the swiftflowing Hwangho Then a little yellow face peeped
out of a cave farther up the cliff a blackhaired tightly braided head
bobbed and twitched with delight and the next moment the good priest
was heartily thanking his small ally for so skilfully saving him from
threatened capture

It was a cool September morning in the days of the great Emperor Tai
twelve hundred and fifty years ago And a great emperor was Taitsung
though few if any of my young readers ever heard his name His
splendid palace stood in the midst of lovely gardens in the great city
of Changanthat old old city that for over two thousand years was
the capital of China and which you can now find in your geographies
under its modern name of Singanfoo And in the year 635 when our
story opens the name of Taitsung was great and powerful throughout the
length and breadth of Chung Kwohthe Middle Kingdom as the Chinese
for nearly thirty centuries have called their vast countrywhile the
stories of his fame and power had reached to the western courts of India
and of Persia of Constantinople and even of distant Rome

It was a time of darkness and strife in Europe Already what historians
have called the Dark Ages had settled upon the Christian world And
among all the races of men the only nation that was civilized and
learned and cultivated and refined in this seventh century of the
Christian era was this far eastern Empire of China where schools and
learning flourished and arts and manufactures abounded when America
was as yet undiscovered and Europe was sunk in degradation

And here since the year 505 the Nestorians a branch of the Christian
Church originating in Asia Minor in the fifth century and often called
the Protestants of the East had been spreading the story of the life
and love of Christ And here in this year of grace 635 in the city of
Changan and in all the region about the Yellow River the good priest
Thomas the Nestorian whom the Chinese called Olopunthe nearest
approach they could give to his strange Syriac namehad his Christian
missionhouse and was zealously bringing to the knowledge of a great
and enlightened people the still greater and more helpful light of
Christianity

My daughter said the Nestorian after his words of thanks were
uttered this is a gracious deed done to me and one that I may not
easily repay Yet would I gladly do so if I might Tell me what wouldst
thou like above all other things

The answer of the girl was as ready as it was unexpected

To be a boy O master she replied Let the great Shangti1 whose
might thou teachest make me a man that I may have revenge

1 Almighty Being


The good priest had found strange things in his mission work in this
far Eastern land but this wrathful demand of an excited little maid was
full as strange as any For China is and ever has been a land in which
the chief things taught the children are subordination passive
submission to the law to parents and to all superiors and a peaceful
demeanor

Revenge is not for men to trifle with nor maids to talk of he said
Harbor no such desires but rather come with me and I will show thee
more attractive things This very day doth the great emperor go forth
from the City of Peace1 to the banks of the Yellow River Come thou
with me to witness the splendor of his train and perchance even to see
the great emperor himself and the young Prince Kaou his son

1 The meaning of Changan the ancient capital of China is the City
of Continuous Peace


That I will not then cried the girl more hotly than before I hate
this great emperor as men do wrongfully call him and I hate the young
Prince Kaou May Lung Wang the god of the dragons dash them both
beneath the Yellow River ere yet they leave its banks this day

At this terrible wish on the lips of a girl the good master very
nearly forgot even his most valuable preceptnever to be surprised He
regarded his defiant young companion in sheer amazement

Have a care have a care my daughter he said at length The blessed
Saint James telleth us that the tongue is a little member but it can
kindle a great fire How mayst thou hope to say such direful words
against the Son of Heaven1 and live

1 The Son of Heaven is one of the chief titles of the Chinese
emperor


The Son of Heaven killed the emperor my father said the child

The emperor thy father Thomas the Nestorian almost gasped in this
latest surprise Is the girl crazed or doth she sport with one who
seeketh her good And amazement and perplexity settled upon his face

The Princess Woo is neither crazed nor doth she sport with the master
said the girl I do but speak the truth Great is Taitsung Whom he
will he slayeth and whom he will he keepeth alive And then she told
the astonished priest that the bannerman of the Dragon Gate was not
her father at all For she said as she had lain awake only the night
before she had heard enough in talk between the bannerman and his wife
to learn her secrethow that she was the only daughter of the rightful
emperor the Prince Kungti whose guardian and chief adviser the
present emperor had been how this trusted protector had made away with
poor Kungti in order that he might usurp the throne and how she the
Princess Woo had been flung into the swift Hwangho from the turbid
waters of which she had been rescued by the bannerman of the Dragon
Gate

This may or may not be so Thomas the Nestorian said uncertain
whether or not to credit the girls surprising story but even were it
true my daughter how couldst thou right thyself What can a girl hope
to do

The young princess drew up her small form proudly Do she cried in
brave tones I can do much wise Olopun girl though I am Did not
a girl save the divine books of Confucius when the great Emperor
ChiHwangti did command the burning of all the books in the empire
Did not a girlthough but a soothsayers daughterraise the outlaw Liu
Pang straight to the Yellow Throne And shall I who am the daughter of
emperors fail to be as able or as brave as they

The wise Nestorian was shrewd enough to see that here was a prize that
might be worth the fostering By the assumption of mystic knowledge he
learned from the bannerman of the Dragon Gate the truth of the girls
story and so worked upon the good bannermans native superstition and
awe of superior power as to secure the custody of the young princess
and to place her in his missionhouse at TungChow for teaching and
guidance Among the early Christians the Nestorians held peculiarly
helpful and elevating ideas of the worth and proper condition of woman
Their precepts were full of mutual help courtesy and fraternal love
All these the Princess Woo learned under her preceptors guidance
She grew to be even more assertive and selfreliant and became also
expert in many sports in which in that womandespising country only
boys could hope to excel One day when she was about fourteen years
old the Princess Woo was missing from the Nestorian missionhouse by
the Yellow River Her troubled guardian in much anxiety set out to
find the truant and finally in the course of his search climbed the
high bluff from which he saw the massive walls the many gateways
the gleaming roofs and porcelain towers of the Imperial city of
Changanthe City of Continuous Peace

But even before he had entered its northern gate a little maid in loose
silken robe peaked cap and embroidered shoes had passed through that
very gateway and slipping through the thronging streets of the great
city approached at last the group of picturesque and glittering
buildings that composed the palace of the great Emperor Tai

Just within the main gateway of the palace rose the walls of the
Imperial Academy where eight thousand Chinese boys received instruction
under the patronage of the emperor while just beyond extended the
long low range of the archery school in which even the emperor himself
sometimes came to witness or take part in the exciting contests

Drawing about her shoulders the yellow sash that denoted alliance
with royalty the Princess Woo without a moments hesitation walked
straight through the palace gateway past the wondering guards and into
the boundaries of the archery court

Here the young Prince Kaou an indolent and lazy lad of about her own
age was cruelly goading on his trained crickets to a ferocious fight
within their gilded bamboo cage while just at hand the slaves were
preparing his bow and arrows for his daily archery practice

Now among the rulers of China there are three classes of privileged
targetsthe skin of the bear for the emperor himself the skin of the
deer for the princes of the blood and the skin of the tiger for the
nobles of the court and thus side by side in the Imperial Archery
School at Changan hung the three targets

The girl with the royal sash and the determined face walked straight up
to the Prince Kaou The boy left off goading his fighting crickets and
looked in astonishment at this strange and highly audacious girl who
dared to enter a place from which all women were excluded Before the
guards could interfere she spoke

Are the arrows of the great Prince Kaou so well fitted to the cord
she said that he dares to try his skill with one who although a girl
hath yet the wit and right to test his skill

The guards laid hands upon the intruder to drag her away but the
prince nettled at her tone yet glad to welcome any thing that promised
novelty or amusement bade them hold off their hands

No girl speaketh thus to the Prince Kaou and liveth he said
insolently Give me instant test of thy boast or the wooden collar1
in the palace torturehouse shall be thy fate

1 The wooden collar was the kia or canguea terrible
instrument of torture used in China for the punishment of criminals


Give me the arrows Prince the girl said bravely and I will make
good my words

At a sign the slaves handed her a bow and arrows But as she tried the
cord and glanced along the polished shaft the prince said

Yet stay girl here is no target set for thee Let the slaves set up
the peoples target These are not for such as thou

Nay Prince fret not thyself the girl coolly replied My target
is here and while all looked on in wonder the undaunted girl
deliberately toed the practice line twanged her bow and with a sudden
whiz sent her wellaimed shaft quivering straight into the small white
centre of the great bearskinthe imperial target itself

With a cry of horror and of rage at such sacrilege the guards pounced
upon the girl archer and would have dragged her away But with the same
quick motion that had saved her from the Tartar robbers she sprang
from their grasp and standing full before the royal target she said
commandingly

Hands off slaves nor dare to question my right to the bearskin
target I am the Empress

It needed but this to cap the climax Prince guards and slaves
looked at this extraordinary girl in openmouthed wonder But ere their
speechless amazement could change to instant seizure a loud laugh rang
from the imperial doorway and a hearty voice exclaimed Braved and
by a girl Who is thy Empress Prince Let me too salute the
Tsihtien1 Then a portly figure clad in yellow robes strode down
to the targets while all within the archery lists prostrated themselves
in homage before one of Chinas greatest monarchsthe Emperor
Taitsung Wunwooti2

1 The Sovereign Divinean imperial title

2 Our Exalted Ancestorthe LiteraryMartial Emperor


But before even the emperor could reach the girl the bamboo screen
was swept hurriedly aside and into the archery lists came the anxious
priest Thomas the Nestorian He had traced his missing charge even to
the imperial palace and now found her in the very presence of those he
deemed her mortal enemies Prostrate at the emperors feet he told the
young girls story and then pleaded for her life promising to keep her
safe and secluded in his missionhome at TungChow

The Emperor Tai laughed a mighty laugh for the bold front of this only
daughter of his former master and rival suited his warlike humor But
he was a wise and clement monarch withal

Nay wise Olopun he said Such rivals to our throne may not be
at large even though sheltered in the temples of the hungmao1
The royal blood of the house of Sui2 flows safely only within palace
walls Let the proper decree be registered and let the gifts be
exchanged for tomorrow thy ward the Princess Woo becometh one of our
most noble queens

1 The lighthaired onesan old Chinese term for the western
Christians

2 The name of the former dynasty


And so at fourteen even as the records show this strongwilled young
girl of the Yellow River became one of the wives of the great Emperor
Tai She proved a very gracious and acceptable stepmother to young
Prince Kaou who as the records also tell us grew so fond of the girl
queen that within a year from the death of his great father and when
he himself had succeeded to the Yellow Throne as Emperor Supreme
he recalled the Queen Woo from her retirement in the missionhouse at
TungChow and made her one of his royal wives Five years after in the
year 655 she was declared Empress and during the reign of her lazy and
indolent husband she was the power behind the throne And when in
the year 683 Kaoutsung died she boldly assumed the direction of
the government and ascending the throne declared herself Woo How
TsihtienWoo the Empress Supreme and Sovereign Divine

History records that this Zenobia of China proved equal to the great
task She governed the empire with discretion extended its borders
and was acknowledged as empress from the shores of the Pacific to the
borders of Persia of India and of the Caspian Sea

Her reign was one of the longest and most successful in that period
known in history as the Golden Age of China Because of the relentless
native prejudice against a successful woman in a country where girl
babies are ruthlessly drowned as the quickest way of ridding the world
of useless incumbrances Chinese historians have endeavored to blacken
her character and undervalue her services But later scholars now see
that she was a powerful and successful queen who did great good to her
native land and strove to maintain its power and glory

She never forgot her good friend and protector Thomas the Nestorian
During her long reign of almost fifty years Christianity strengthened
in the kingdom and obtained a footing that only the great Mahometan
conquests of five centuries later entirely destroyed and the Empress
Woo so the chronicles declare herself offered sacrifices to the great
God of all When hundreds of years after the Jesuit missionaries
penetrated into this most exclusive of all the nations of the earth
they found near the palace at Changan the ruins of the Nestorian
mission church with the cross still standing and preserved through
all the changes of dynasties an abstract in Syriac characters of the
Christian law and with it the names of seventytwo attendant priests
who had served the church established by Olopun

Thus in a land in which from the earliest ages women have been
regarded as little else but slaves did a selfpossessed and wise young
girl triumph over all difficulties and rule over her many millions of
subjects in a manner becoming a great prince This even her enemies
admit Lessening the miseries of her subjects so the historians
declare she governed the wide Empire of China wisely discreetly and
peacefully and she displayed upon the throne all the daring wit and
wisdom that had marked her actions when years before she was nothing
but a sprightly and determined little Chinese maiden on the banks of
the turbid Yellow River




EDITH OF SCOTLAND THE GIRL OF THE NORMAN ABBEY

Afterward known as the Good Queen Maud of England AD 1093

On a broad and deep windowseat in the old Abbey guesthouse at
Gloucester sat two young girls of thirteen and ten before them
bravelooking enough in his oldtime costume stood a manly young fellow
of sixteen The three were in earnest conversation all unmindful of
the noise about themthe romp and riot of a throng of young folk
attendants or followers of the knights and barons of King Williams
court

For William Rufus son of the Conqueror and second Norman king of
England held his Whitsuntide gemot or summer council of his lords and
lieges in the curious old RomanSaxonNorman town of Gloucester in the
fair vale through which flows the noble Severn The city is known to the
young folk of today as the one in which good Robert Raikes started the
first Sundayschool more than a hundred years ago But the gemot of
King William the Red which was a far different gathering from good Mr
Raikes Sundayschool was held in the great chapterhouse of the old
Benedictine Abbey while the court was lodged in the Abbey guesthouses
in the grim and fortresslike Gloucester Castle and in the houses of
the quaint old town itself

The boy was shaking his head rather doubtfully as he stood looking down
upon the two girls on the broad windowseat

Nay nay beausire1 shake not your head like that exclaimed the
younger of the girls We did escape that way trust me we did Edith
here can tell you I do speak the truthfor sure t was her device

1 Fair sir an ancient style of address used especially toward
those high in rank in Norman times


Thirteenyearold Edith laughed merrily enough at her sisters
perplexity and said gayly as the lad turned questioningly to her

Sure then beausire t is plain to see that you are Southronborn and
know not the complexion of a Scottish mist Yet t is even as Mary said
For as we have told you the Maidens Castle standeth highplaced on
the crag in Edwins Burgh and hath many and devious pathways to the
lower gate So when the Red Donalds men were swarming up the steep my
uncle the Atheling did guide us by ways we knew well and by twists
and turnings that none knew better straight through Red Donalds array
and all unseen and unnoted of them because of the blessed thickness of
the gathering mist

And this was YOUR device asked the boy admiringly

Ay but any one might have devised it too replied young Edith
modestly Sure t was no great device to use a Scotch mist for
our safety and t were wiser to chance it than stay and be stupidly
murdered by Red Donalds men And so it was good Robert even as Mary
did say that we came forth unharmed from amidst them and fled here to
King Williams court where we at last are safe

Safe say you safe exclaimed the lad impulsively Ay as safe as
is a mouses nest in a cats earas safe as is a rabbit in a ferrets
hutch But that I know you to be a brave and dauntless maid I should
say to you

But ere Edith could know what he would say their conference was rudely
broken in upon For a royal page dashing up to the three with scant
courtesy seized the arm of the elder girl and said hurriedly

Haste ye haste ye my lady Our lord king is even now calling for you
to come before him in the banquethall

Edith knew too well the rough manners of those dangerous days She freed
herself from the grasp of the page and said

Nay that may I not master page T is neither safe nor seemly for a
maid to show herself in barons hall or in kings banquetroom

Safe and seemly it may not be but come you must said the page
rudely The king demands it and your nay is naught

And so hurried along whether she would or no while her friend Robert
Fitz Godwine accompanied her as far as he dared the young Princess
Edith was speedily brought into the presence of the king of England
William H called from the color of his hair and from his fiery
temper Rufus or the Red

For Edith and Mary were both princesses of Scotland with a history
even before they had reached their teens as romantic as it was
exciting Their mother an exiled Saxon princess had after the
conquest of Saxon England by the stern Duke William the Norman found
refuge in Scotland and had there married King Malcolm Canmore the son
of that King Duncan whom Macbeth had slain But when King Malcolm
had fallen beneath the walls of Alnwick Castle a victim to English
treachery and when his fierce brother Donald Bane or Donald the Red
had usurped the throne of Scotland then the good Queen Margaret died in
the gray castle on the rock of Edinburgh and the five orphaned children
were only saved from the vengeance of their bad uncle Donald by the
shrewd and daring device of the young Princess Edith who bade their
good uncle Edgar the Atheling guide them under cover of the mist
straight through the Red Donalds knights and spearmen to England and
safety

You would naturally suppose that the worst possible place for the
fugitives to seek safety was in Norman England for Edgar the Atheling
a Saxon prince had twice been declared king of England by the Saxon
enemies of the Norman conquerors and the children of King Malcolm and
Queen Margarethalf Scotch half Saxonwere by blood and birth of
the two races most hateful to the conquerors But the Red King in his
rough sort of wayhot today and cold tomorrowhad shown something
almost like friendship for this Saxon Atheling or royal prince who
might have been king of England had he not wisely submitted to the
greater power of Duke William the Conqueror and to the Red William his
son More than this it had been rumored that some two years before
when there was truce between the kings of England and of Scotland this
harsh and headstrong English king who was as rough and repelling as a
chestnut burr had seen noticed and expressed a particular interest
in the elevenyearold Scottish girlthis very Princess Edith who now
sought his protection

So when this wandering uncle boldly threw himself upon Norman courtesy
and came with his homeless nephews and nieces straight to the Norman
court for safety King William Rufus not only received these children
of his hereditary foeman with favor and royal welcome but gave them
comfortable lodgment in quaint old Gloucester town where he held his
court

But even when the royal fugitives deemed themselves safest were they in
the greatest danger

Among the attendant knights and nobles of King Williams court was
a Saxon knight known as Sir Ordgar a thegn1 or baronet of
Oxfordshire and because those who change their opinionspolitical
or otherwiseoften prove the most unrelenting enemies of their former
associates it came to pass that Sir Ordgar the Saxon conceived a
strong dislike for these orphaned descendants of the Saxon kings and
convinced himself that the best way to secure himself in the good graces
of the Norman King William was to slander and accuse the children of the
Saxon Queen Margaret

1 Pronounced thane


And so that very day in the great hall when wine was flowing and
passions were strong this false knight raising his glass bade them
all drink Confusion to the enemies of our liege the king from the
base Philip of France to the baser Edgar the Atheling and his Scottish
brats

This was an insult that even the heavy and peaceloving nature of Edgar
the Atheling could not brook He sprang to his feet and denounced the
charge

None here is truer or more leal to you lord king he said than am
I Edgar the Atheling and my charges your guests

But King William Rufus was of that changing temper that goes with
jealousy and suspicion His flushed face grew still more red and
turning away from the Saxon prince he demanded

Why make you this charge Sir Ordgar

Because of its truth beausire said the faithless knight For what
other cause hath this false Atheling sought sanctuary here save to use
his own descent from the ancient kings of this realm to make head and
force among your lieges And his eldest kinsgirl here the Princess
Edith hath she not been spreading a trumpery story among the younger
folk of how some old wyrdwif1 hath said that she who is the daughter
of kings shall be the wife and mother of kings And is it not further
true that when her aunt the Abbess of Romsey bade her wear the holy
veil she hath again and yet again torn it off and affirmed that she
who was to be a queen could never be made a nun Children and fools
t is said do speak the truth beausire and in all this do I see the
malice and device of this false Atheling the friend of your rebellious
brother Duke Robert as you do know him to be and I do brand him here
in this presence as traitor and recreant to you his lord

1 Witchwife or seeress


The anger of the jealous king grew more unreasoning as Sir Ordgar went
on

Enough he cried Seize the traitoror stay children and fools
as you have said Sir Ordgar do indeed speak the truth Have in the
girl and let us hear the truth Not seemly Sir Atheling he broke
out in reply to some protest of Ediths uncle Aught is seemly that the
king doth wish Holo Raoul Damian sirrah pages Run one of you and
seek the Princess Edith and bring her here forthwith

And while Edgar the Atheling realizing that this was the gravest of
all his dangers strove though without effect to reason with the angry
king Damian the page as we have seen hurried after the Princess
Edith

How now mistress broke out the Red King as the young girl was
ushered into the banquethall where the disordered tables strewn with
fragments of the feast showed the ungentle manners of those brutal
days How now mistress do you prate of kings and queens and of your
own designsyou who are but a beggar guest Is it seemly or wise
to talknay keep you quiet Sir Atheling we will have naught from
youto talk of thrones and crowns as if you did even now hope to win
the realm from mefrom me your only protector

The Princess Edith was a very highspirited maiden as all the stories
of her girlhood show And this unexpected accusation instead of
frightening her only served to embolden her She looked the angry
monarch full in the face

T is a false and lying charge lord king she said from whomsoever
it may come Naught have I said but praise of you and your courtesy to
us motherless folk T is a false and lying charge and I am ready to
stand test of its proving come what may

Even to the judgment of God girl demanded the king

And the brave girl made instant reply Even to the judgment of God
lord king Then skilled in all the curious customs of those warlike
times she drew off her glove Whosoever my accuser be lord king
she said I do denounce him as foresworn and false and thus do I throw
myself upon Gods good mercy if it shall please him to raise me up a
champion And she flung her glove upon the floor of the hall in face
of the king and all his barons

It was a bold thing for a girl to do and a murmur of applause ran
through even that unfriendly throng For to stand the test of a wager
of battle or the judgment of God as the savage contest was called
was the last resort of any one accused of treason or of crime It meant
no less than a duel to the death between the accuser and the accused
or their accepted champions and upon the result of the duel hung the
lives of those in dispute And the Princess Ediths glove lying on the
floor of the Abbey hall was her assertion that she had spoken the truth
and was willing to risk her life in proof of her innocence

Edgar the Atheling peacelover though he was would gladly have
accepted the post of champion for his niece but as one also involved
in the charge of treason such action was denied him

For the moment the Red Kings former admiration for this brave young
princess caused him to waver but those were days when suspicion and
jealousy rose above all nobler traits His face grew stern again

Ordgar of Oxford he said take up the glove and Edith knew who was
her accuser Then the King asked Who standeth as champion for Edgar
the Atheling and this maid his niece

Almost before the words were spoken young Robert Fitz Godwine had sprung
to Ediths side

That would I lord king if a young squire might appear against a
belted knight

Ordgar of Oxford fights not with boys said the accuser
contemptuously

The kings savage humor broke out again

Face him with your own page Sir Ordgar he said with a grim laugh
Boy against boy would be a fitting wager for a young maids life But
the Saxon knight was in no mood for sport

Nay beausire this is no childs play he said I care naught
for this girl I stand as champion for the king against yon traitor
Atheling and if the maidens cause is his why then against her too
This is a mans quarrel

Young Robert would have spoken yet again as his face flushed hot with
anger at the knights contemptuous words But a firm hand was laid upon
his shoulder and a strong voice said

Then is it mine Sir Ordgar If between man and man then will I with
the gracious permission of our lord the king stand as champion for this
maiden here and for my good lord the noble Atheling whose liegeman
and whose man am I next to you lord king And taking the mate to the
glove which the Princess Edith had flung down in defiance he thrust it
into the guard of his cappe line or iron skullcap in token that
he Godwine of Winchester the father of the boy Robert was the young
girls champion

Three days after in the tiltyard of Gloucester Castle the wager of
battle was fought It was no gay tournament show with streaming banners
gorgeous lists gayly dressed ladies flowerbedecked balconies and all
the splendid display of a tourney of the knights of which you read
in the stories of romance and chivalry It was a solemn and sombre
gathering in which all the arrangements suggested only death and gloom
while the accused waited in suspense knowing that halter and fagot
were prepared for them should their champion fall In quaint and crabbed
Latin the old chronicler John of Fordun tells the story of the fight
for which there is neither need nor space here The glove of each
contestant was flung into the lists by the judge and the dispute
committed for settlement to the power of God and their own good swords
It is a stirring picture of those days of daring and of might when
force took the place of justice and the deadliest blows were the only
convincing arguments But though supported by the favor of the king and
the display of splendid armor Ordgars treachery had its just reward
Virtue triumphed and vice was punished Even while treacherously
endeavoring after being once disarmed to stab the brave Godwine with
a knife which he had concealed in his boot the false Sir Ordgar was
overcome confessed the falsehood of his charge against Edgar the
Atheling and Edith his niece and as the quaint old record has it
The strength of his grief and the multitude of his wounds drove out his
impious soul

So young Edith was saved and as is usually the case with men of his
character the Red Kings humor changed completely The victorious
Godwine received the arms and lands of the dead Ordgar Edgar the
Atheling was raised high in trust and honor the throne of Scotland
wrested from the Red Donald was placed once more in the family of
King Malcolm and King William Rufus himself became the guardian and
protector of the Princess Edith

And when one fatal August day the Red King was found pierced by an
arrow under the trees of the New Forest his younger brother Duke
Henry whom men called Beauclerc the good scholar for his love of
learning and of books ascended the throne of England as King Henry I
And the very year of his accession on the 11th of November 1100 he
married in the Abbey of Westminster the Princess Edith of Scotland
then a fair young lady of scarce twentyone At the request of her
husband she took upon her coronation day the Norman name of Matilda
or Maud and by this name she is known in history and among the queens
of England

So scarce four and thirty years after the Norman conquest a Saxon
princess sat upon the throne of Norman England the loving wife of the
son of the very man by whom Saxon England was conquered

Never since the battle of Hastings says Sir Francis Palgrave the
historian had there been such a joyous day as when Queen Maud was
crowned Victors and vanquished Normans and Saxons were united at
last and the name of Good Queen Maud was long an honored memory among
the people of England

And she was a good queen In a time of bitter tyranny when the common
people were but the serfs and slaves of the haughty and cruel barons
this young queen labored to bring in kindlier manners and more gentle
ways Beautiful in face she was still more lovely in heart and life
Her influence upon her husband Henry the scholar was seen in the
wise laws he made and the Charter of King Henry is said to have been
gained by her intercession This important paper was the first step
toward popular liberty It led the way to Magna Charta and finally
to our own Declaration of Independence The boys and girls of America
therefore in common with those of England can look back with interest
and affection upon the romantic story of Good Queen Maud the
bravehearted girl who showed herself wise and fearless both in the
perilous mist at Edinburgh and later still in the yet greater dangers
of the black lists of Gloucester




JACQUELINE OF HOLLAND THE GIRL OF THE LAND OF FOGS AD 1414

Count William of Hainault of Zealand and Friesland Duke of Bavaria
and Sovereign Lord of Holland held his court in the great straggling
castle which he called his hunting lodge near to the German Ocean
and since known by the name of The Hague1

1 The Hague is a contraction of the Dutchs Gravenhagethe haag or
hunting lodge of the Graf or count


Count William was a gallant and courtly knight learned in all the ways
of chivalry the model of the younger cavaliers handsome in person
noble in bearing the surest lance in the tiltingyard and the stoutest
arm in the foray

Like Jephtha Judge of Israel of whom the mockmad Hamlet sang to
Polonius Count William had

 One fair daughter and no more
 The which he loved passing well

and truth to tell this fair young Jacqueline the little Lady of
Holland as men called herbut whom Count William because of her
fearless antics and boyish ways called Dame Jacob1loved her
knightly father with equal fervor

1 Jaqueline is the French rendering of the Dutch Jakobinethe
feminine of Jakob or James


As she sat that day in the great Hall of the Knights in the massive
castle at The Hague she could see among all the knights and nobles
who came from far and near to join in the festivities at Count Williams
court not one that approached her father in nobility of bearing or
manly strengthnot even her husband

Her husband Yes For this little maid of thirteen had been for eight
years the wife of the Dauphin of France the young Prince John of
Touraine to whom she had been married when she was scarce five years
old and he barely nine Surrounded by all the pomp of an age of glitter
and display these royal children lived in their beautiful castle of
Quesnoy in Flanders1 when they were not as at the time of our
story residents at the court of the powerful Count William of Holland

1 Now Northeastern France


Other young people were there toonobles and pages and little
ladiesinwaiting and there was much of the stately ceremonial and
flowery talk that in those days of knighthood clothed alike the fears of
cowards and the desires of heroes For there have always been heroes and
cowards in the world

And so between all these young folk there was much boastful talk and
much harmless gossip how the little Lady of Courtrai had used the wrong
corner of the towel yesterday how the fat Duchess of Enkhuysen had
violated the laws of all etiquette by placing the wrong number of
fingerbowls upon her table on St Jacobs Day and how the stout young
Hubert of Malsen had scattered the rascal merchants of Dort at their
Shrovetide fair

Then uprose the young Lord of Arkell

Hold there he cried hotly This Hubert of Malsen is but a craven
sirs if he doth say the merchants of Dort are rascal cowards Had they
been fairly mated he had no more dared to put his nose within the gates
of Dort than dare one of you here to go down yonder amid Count Williams
lions

Have a care friend Otto said the little Lady of Holland with
warning finger there is one here at least who dareth to go amid the
lionsmy father sir

I said nothing of him madam replied Count Otto I did mean these
young red hats here who do no more dare to bait your fathers lions
than to face the Cods of Dort in fair and equal fight

At this bold speech there was instant commotion For the nobles and
merchants of Holland four centuries and a half ago were at open strife
with one another The nobles saw in the increasing prosperity of the
merchants the end of their own feudal power and tyranny The merchants
recognized in the arrogant nobles the only bar to the growth of
Hollands commercial enterprise So each faction had its leaders its
partisans its badges and its followers Many and bloody were the feuds
and fights that raged through all those lowlying lands of Holland as
the nobles or Hooks as they were calleddistinguishable by their
big red hatsand the merchants or Cods with their slouch hats of
quiet gray struggled for the lead in the state And how they DID hate
one another

Certain of the younger nobles however who were opposed to the reigning
house of Holland of which Count William young Jacquelines father
was the head had espoused the cause of the merchants seeing in their
success greater prosperity and wealth for Holland Among these had been
the young Lord of Arkell now a sort of half prisoner at Count Williams
court because of certain bold attempts to favor the Cods in his
own castle of Arkell His defiant words therefore raised a storm of
protests

Nay then Lord of Arkell said the Dauphin John you who prate so
loudly would better prove your words by some sign of your own valor
You may have dared fight your lady mother who so roundly punished you
therefor but a lion hath not the tender ways of a woman Face YOU
the lions lord count and I will warrant me they will not prove as
forbearing as did she

It was common talk at Count Williams court that the brave Lady of
Arkell mother of the Count Otto had made her way disguised into
we castle of her son had herself lowered the drawbridge admitted her
armed retainers overpowered and driven out her rebellious son and that
then relenting she had appealed to Count William to pardon the lad and
to receive him at court as hostage for his own fealty So this fling of
the Dauphins cut deep

But before the young Otto could return an angry answer Jacqueline had
interfered

Nay nay my lord she said to her husband the Dauphin t is not a
knightly act thus to impeach the honor of a noble guest

But now the Lord of Arkell had found his tongue

My lord prince he said bowing low with stately courtesy if as
my lady mother and good Count William would force me I am to be loyal
vassal to you my lieges here I should but follow where you dare to
lead Go YOU into the lions den lord prince and I will follow you
though it were into old Hercules very teeth

It was a shrewd reply and covered as good a doubledare as ever one
boy made to another Some of the manlier of the young courtiers indeed
even dared to applaud But the Dauphin John was stronger in tongue than
in heart

Peste he cried contemptuously T is a fools answer and a fools
will And well shall we see now how you will sneak out of it all See
Lord of Arkell you who can prate so loudly of Cods and lions here
before all I dare you to face Count Williams lions yourself

The young Lord of Arkell was in his rich court suita tightfitting
greatsleeved silk jacket rich violet chausses or tights and pointed
shoes But without a word with scarce a look toward his challenger he
turned to his nearest neighbor a brave Zealand lad afterward noted in
Dutch historyFrancis von Borselen

Lend me your gabardine friend Franz will you not he said

The young von Borselen took from the back of the settle over which it
was flung his gabardinethe long loose gray cloak that was a sort of
overcoat in those days of queer costume

It is here my Otto he said

The Lord of Arkell drew the loose gray cloak over his rich silk suit
and turned toward the door

Otto von Arkell lets no one call him fool or coward lord prince he
said What I have dared you all to do _I_ dare do if you do not See
now I will face Count Williams lions

The Princess Jacqueline sprang up in protest

No no you shall not she cried My lord prince did but jest as did
we all John she said turning appealingly to her young husband who
sat sullen and unmoved tell him you meant no such murderous test My
father she cried turning now toward Count William whose attention
had been drawn to the dispute the Lord of Arkell is pledged to face
your lions

Count William of Holland dearly loved pluck and nerve

Well daughter mine he said then will he keep his pledge Friend
Otto is a brave young gallant else had he never dared raised spear and
banner as he did against his rightful liege

But my father persisted the gentlehearted girl spear and banner
are not lions jaws And surely you may not in honor permit the wilful
murder of a hostage

Nay madam have no fear the Lord of Arkell said bending in
courteous recognition of her interest that which I do of mine own free
will is no murder even should it fail

And he hastened from the hall

A raised gallery looked down into the spacious inclosure in which Count
William kept the living specimens of his own princely badge of the lion
And here the company gathered to see the sport

With the gray gabardine drawn but loosely over his silken suit so
that he might if need be easily slip from it Otto von Arkell boldly
entered the inclosure

Soho Juno up Hercules hollo up Ajax cried Count William
from the balcony Here cometh a right royal playfellowup up my
beauties and the great brutes roused by the voice of their master
pulled themselves up shook themselves awake and stared at the
intruder

Boldly and without hesitation while all the watchers had eyes but for
him alone the young Lord of Arkell walked straight up to Hercules
the largest of the three and laid his hand caressingly upon the shaggy
mane Close to his side pressed Juno the lioness and so says the
record of the old Dutch chronicler von Hildegaersberch the lions did
him no harm he played with them as if they had been dogs

But Ajax fiercest of the three took no notice of the lad Straight
across his comrades he looked to where scarce a rod behind the daring
lad came another figure a light and graceful form in clinging robes of
blue and undergown of cloth of goldthe Princess Jacqueline herself

The watchers in the gallery followed the lions stare and saw with
horror the advancing figure of this fair young girl A cry of terror
broke from every lip The Dauphin John turned pale with fright and
Count William of Holland calling out Down Ajax back girl back
sprang to his feet as if he would have vaulted over the gallery rail

But before he could act Ajax himself had acted With a bound he
cleared the intervening space and crouched at the feet of the fair young
Princess Jacqueline

The lions must have been in remarkably good humor on that day for as
the records tell us they did no harm to their visitors Ajax slowly
rose and looked up into the girls calm face Then the voice of
Jacqueline rang out fresh and clear as standing with her hand buried in
the lions tawny mane she raised her face to the startled galleries

You who could dare and yet dared not to do she cried it shall not
be said that in all Count Williams court none save the rebel Lord of
Arkell dared to face Count Williams lions

The Lord of Arkell sprang to his comrades side With a hurried word of
praise he flung the gabardine about her grasped her arm and bade her
keep her eyes firmly fixed upon the lions then step by step those two
foolhardy young persons backed slowly out of the danger into which they
had so thoughtlessly and unnecessarily forced themselves

The lions gate closed behind them with a clang the shouts of approval
and of welcome sounded from the thronging gallery and over all they
heard the voice of the Lord of Holland mingling commendation and praise
with censure for the rashness of their action

And it WAS a rash and foolish act But we must remember that those
were days when such feats were esteemed as brave and valorous For the
Princess Jaqueline of Holland was reared in the school of socalled
chivalry and romance which in her time was fast approaching its
end She was indeed as one historian declares the last heroine
of knighthood Her very titles suggest the days of chivalry She was
Daughter of Holland Countess of Ponthieu Duchess of Berry Lady of
Crevecoeur of Montague and Arloeux Brought up in the midst of tilts
and tournaments of banquets and feasting and all the lavish display of
the rich Bavarian court she was as we learn from her chroniclers
the leader of adoring knights and vassals the idol of her parents
the ruler of her softhearted boy husband an expert falconer a daring
horsewoman and a fearless descendant of those woman warriors of her
race Margaret the Empress and Philippa the Queen and of a house that
traced its descent through the warlike Hohenstaufens back to Charlemagne
himself

All girls admire bravery even though not themselves personally
courageous It is not therefore surprising that this intrepid and
romancereared young princess the wife of a lad for whom she never
especially cared and whose society had for political reasons been
forced upon her should have placed as the hero of her admiration next
to her own fearless father not the Dauphin John of France but this
brave young rebel lad Otto the Lord of Arkell

But the joyous days of fete and pleasure at Quesnoy at Paris and The
Hague were fast drawing to a close On the fourth of April 1417 the
Dauphin John died by poisoning in his fathers castle at Compiegnethe
victim of those terrible and relentless feuds that were then disgracing
and endangering the feeble throne of France

The dream of future power and greatness as Queen of France in which the
girl wife of the Dauphin had often indulged was thus rudely dispelled
and Jacqueline returned to her fathers court in Holland no longer
crown princess and heiress to a throne but simply Lady of Holland

But in Holland too sorrow was in store for her Swiftly following the
loss of her husband the Dauphin came the still heavier blow of her
fathers death On the thirtieth of May 1417 Count William died in his
castle of Bouchain in Hainault and his sorrowing daughter Jacqueline
now a beautiful girl of sixteen succeeded to his titles and lordship as
Countess and Lady Supreme of Hainault of Holland and of Zealand

For years however there had been throughout the Low Countries a strong
objection to the rule of a woman The death of Count William showed the
Cods a way toward greater liberty Rebellion followed rebellion and the
rule of the Countess Jacqueline was by no means a restful one

And chief among the rebellious spirits as leader and counsellor among
the Cods appeared the brave lad who had once been the companion of the
princess in danger the young Lord of Arkell

It was he who lifted the standard of revolt against her regency Placing
the welfare of Holland above personal friendship and sinking in his
desire for glory even the chivalry of that day which should have
prompted him to aid rather than annoy this beautiful girl he raised a
considerable army among the knights of the Cods or liberal party and
the warlike merchants of the cities took possession of many strong
positions in Holland and occupied among other places the important
town of Gorkum on the Maas The stout citadel of the town was however
garrisoned with loyal troops This the Lord of Arkell beseiged and
demanding its surrender sent also a haughty challenge to the young
countess who was hastening to the relief of her beleaguered town

Jacquelines answer was swift and unmistakable With three hundred ships
and six thousand knights and menatarms she sailed from the old harbor
of Rotterdam and the lionflag of her house soon floated above the
loyal citadel of Gorkum

Her doughty Dutch general von Brederode counselled immediate attack
but the girl countess though full of enthusiasm and determination
hesitated

From her station in the citadel she looked over the scene before her
Here along the low bank of the river Maas stretched the camp of her
own followers and the little gayly colored boats that had brought her
army up the river from the red roofs of Rotterdam There stretching out
into the flat country beyond the straggling streets of Gorkum lay the
tents of the rebels And yet they were all her countrymenrebels and
retainers alike Hollanders all they were ever ready to combine for
the defence of their homeland when threatened by foreign foes or by the
destroying ocean floods

Jacquelines eye caught the flutter of the broad banner of the house of
Arkell that waved over the rebel camp

Again she saw the brave lad who alone of all her fathers court save
she had dared to face Count Williams lions again the remembrance of
how his daring had made him one of her heroes filled her heart and
a dream of what might be possessed her Her boy husband the French
Dauphin was dead and she was pledged by her dying fathers command to
marry her cousin whom she detested Duke John of Brabant But how much
better so she reasoned that the name and might of her house as rulers
of Holland should be upheld by a brave and fearless knight On the
impulse of this thought she summoned a loyal and trusted vassal to her
aid

Von Leyenburg she said go you in haste and in secret to the Lord of
Arkell and bear from me this message for his ear alone Thus says the
Lady of Holland Were it not better Otto of Arkell that we join hands
in marriage before the altar than that we spill the blood of faithful
followers and vassals in a cruel fight

It was a singular and perhaps to our modern ears a most unladylike
proposal but it shows how even in the heart of a sovereign countess
and a girl general warlike desires may give place to gentler thoughts

To the Lord Arkell however this unexpected proposition came as an
indication of weakness

My lady countess fears to face my determined followers he thought
Let me but force this fight and the victory is mine In that is greater
glory and more of power than being husband to the Lady of Holland

And so he returned a most ungracious answer

Tell the Countess Jacqueline he said to the knight of Leyenburg
that the honor of her hand I cannot accept I am her foe and would
rather die than marry her

All the hot blood of her ancestors flamed in wrath as young Jacqueline
heard this reply of the rebel lord

Crush we these rebel curs von Brederode she cried pointing to the
banner of Arkell for by my fathers memory they shall have neither
mercy nor life from me

Fast upon the curt refusal of the Lord of Arkell came his message of
defiance

Hear ye Countess of Holland rang out the challenge of the herald
of Arkell as his trumpetblast sounded before the gate of the citadel
the free Lord of Arkell here giveth you word and warning that he will
fight against you on the morrow

And from the citadel came back this ringing reply as the knight of
Leyenburg made answer for his sovereign lady

Hear ye sir Herald and answer thus to the rebel Lord of Arkell For
the purpose of fighting him came we here and fight him we will until
he and his rebels are beaten and dead Long live our Sovereign Lady of
Holland

On the morrow a murky December day in the year 1417 the battle was
joined as announced On the low plain beyond the city knights and
menatarms archers and spearmen closed in the shock of battle and a
stubborn and bloody fight it was

Seven times did the knights of Jacqueline glittering in their steel
armor clash into the rebel ranks seven times were they driven back
until at last the Lord of Arkell with a fiery charge forced them
against the very gates of the citadel The brave von Brederode fell
pierced with wounds and the day seemed lost indeed to the Lady of
Holland

Then Jacqueline the Countess seeing her cause in dangerlike another
Joan of Arc though she was indeed a younger and much more beautiful
girl generalseized the lionbanner of her house and at the head
of her reserve troops charged through the open gate straight into the
ranks of her victorious foes There was neither mercy nor gentleness
in her heart then As when she had cowed with a look Ajax the lion
so now with defiance and wrath in her face she dashed straight at the
foe

Her disheartened knights rallied around her and following the
impetuous girl they wielded axe and lance for the final struggle The
result came quickly The ponderous battleaxe of the knight of Leyenburg
crashed through the helmet of the Lord of Arkell and as the brave young
leader fell to the ground his panicstricken followers turned and fled
The troops of Jacqueline pursued them through the streets of Gorkum and
out into the open country and the vengeance of the countess was sharp
and merciless

But in the flush of victory wrath gave way to pity again and the young
conqueror is reported to have said sadly and in tears

Ah I have won and yet how have I lost

But the knights and nobles who followed her banner loudly praised her
valor and her fearlessness and their highest and most knightly vow
thereafter was to swear By the courage of our Princess

The brilliant victory of this girl of sixteen was not however to
accomplish her desires Peace never came to her Harassed by rebellion
at home and persecuted by her relentless and perfidious uncles Count
John of Bavaria rightly called the Pitiless and Duke Philip of
Burgundy falsely called the Good she who had once been Crown
Princess of France and Lady of Holland died at the early age of
thirtysix stripped of all her titles and estates It is however
pleasant to think that she was happy in the love of her husband the
baron of the forests of the Duke of Burgundy a plain Dutch gentleman
Francis von Borselen the lad who years before had furnished the gray
gabardine that had shielded Count Williams daughter from her fathers
lions

The story of Jacqueline of Holland is one of the most romantic that has
come down to us from those romantic days of the knights Happy only
in her earliest and latest years she is nevertheless a bright and
attractive figure against the dark background of feudal tyranny and
crime The story of her womanhood should indeed be told if we would
study her life as a whole but for us who can in this paper deal only
with her romantic girlhood her young life is to be taken as a type of
the stirring and extravagant days of chivalry

And we cannot but think with sadness upon the power for good that she
might have been in her land of fogs and floods if instead of being made
the tool of party hate and the ambitions of men her frank and fearless
girl nature had been trained to gentle ways and charitable deeds

To be the most picturesque figure in the history of Holland as she
has been called is distinction indeed but higher still must surely be
that gentleness of character and nobility of soul that in these days
of ours may be acquired by every girl and boy who reads this romantic
story of the Countess Jacqueline the fair young Lady of Holland




CATARINA OF VENICE THE GIRL OF THE GRAND CANAL

Afterward known as Queen of Cyprus and Daughter of the Republic
AD 1466


Who is he Why do you not know Catarina mia T is his Most Puissant
Excellency the mighty Lord of Lusignan the runaway Heir of Jerusalem
the beggar Prince of Cyprus with more titles to his nameho ho
hothan he hath jackets to his back and with more dodging than
ducats so t is said when the time to pay for his lodging draweth
nigh Holo Messer Principino Give you goodday Lord of Lusignan Ho
below there here is tribute for you

And down upon the head of a certain sadfaced seedylooking young
fellow in the piazza or square beneath descended a rattling shower of
bonbons thrown by the hand of the speaker a brownfaced Venetian lad
of sixteen

But little Catarina Cornaro just freed from the imprisonment of her
conventschool at Padua felt her heart go out in pity towards this
homeless young prince who just now seemed to be the butt for all the
riot and teasing of the boys of the Great Republic

Nay nay my Giorgio she said to her brother t is neither fair nor
wise so to beset one in dire distress The good sisters of our school
have often told us that t is better to be a beggar than a dullard and
sure yon prince as you do say he is looketh to be no dolt But ah see
there she cried leaning far over the gayly draped balcony see he
can well use his fists can he not Nay though t is a shame so
to beset him say I Why should our lads so misuse a stranger and a
prince

It was the Feast Day of St Mark one of the jolliest of the oldtime
holidays of Venice that wonderful City of the Sea whose patron and
guardian St Mark the apostle was supposed to be Gondolas rich with
draperies of every hue that completely concealed their frames of sombre
black shot in and out and up and down all the waterstreets of the
beautiful city while towering palace and humbler dwelling alike were
gay with gorgeous hangings and fluttering streamers

In noticeable contrast with all the brilliant costumes and laughing
faces around him was the lad who just now seemed in so dire a strait
He had paused to watch one of the passing pageants from the steps of the
Palazzo Cornaro quite near the spot where a century later the famous
bridge known as the Rialto spanned the Street of the Nobles or Grand
Canalone of the most notable spots in the history of Venice the
Wonderful

The lad was indeed a prince the representative of a lordly house that
for more than five hundred years had been strong and powerful first
as barons of France and later as rulers of the Crusaders kingdom
of Jerusalem and the barbaric but wealthy island of Cyprus But poor
Giacomo or James of Lusignan royal prince though he was had been
banished from his fathers court in Cyprus He had dared rebel
against the authority of his stepmother a cruel Greek princess from
Constantinople who ruled her feeble old husband and persecuted her
spirited young stepson the Prince Giacomo

And so with neither money nor friends to help him on he had wandered
to Venice But Venice in 1466 a rich proud and prosperous city was
a very poor place for a lad who had neither friends nor money for of
course the royal prince of a little island in the Mediterranean could
not so demean himself as to soil his hands with work

So I imagine that young Prince Giacomo had any thing but a pleasant time
in Venice On this particular Feast Day of St Mark I am certain that
he was having the most unpleasant of all his bitter experiences as
backed up against one of the columns of the Cornaro Palace he found
himself surrounded by a crowd of thoughtless young Venetians who were
teasing and bullying him to the full content of their brutal young
hearts

The Italian temper is known to be both hot and hasty but the temper of
oriental Cyprus is even more fiery and so it was not surprising that
in this most onesided fray the fun soon became fighting in earnest
for anger begets anger

All about the young prince was a tossing throng of restless and angry
boys while the beleaguered lad still standing at bay flourished a
wickedlooking stiletto above his head and answered taunt with taunt

At this instant the door of the Cornaro Palace opened quickly and the
Prince Giacomo felt himself drawn bodily within while a brightfaced
young girl with flashing eye and defiant air confronted his greatly
surprised tormentors

Shame shame upon you boys of Venice she cried thus to illuse a
stranger in your town Is a score of such as you against one poor
lad the boasted chivalry of Venice Eh via the very fisherlads of
Mendicoli could teach you better ways

Taken quite aback by this sudden apparition and these stinging words
the boys dispersed with scarce an attempt to reply and all the more
hastily because they spied coming up the Grand Canal the gorgeous
gondola of the Companions of the Stocking an association of young men
under whose charge and supervision all the pageants and displays of old
Venice were given

So the piazza was speedily cleared and the Prince Giacomo with many
words of thanks to his young and unknown deliverers hurried from the
spot which had so nearly proved disastrous to him

Changes came suddenly in those unsettled times Within two years both
the Greek stepmother and the feeble old king were dead and Prince
Giacomo after a struggle for supremacy with his halfsister Carlotta
became King of Cyprus

Now Cyprus though scarcely as large as the State of Connecticut was a
very desirable possession and one that Venice greatly coveted Some of
her citizens owned land there and among these was Marco Cornaro father
of Catarina And so it happened that soon after the accession of King
Giacomo Messer Andrea Cornaro the uncle of Catarina came to Cyprus to
inspect and improve the lands belonging to his brother Marco

Venice in those days was so great a power that the Venetian merchants
were highly esteemed in all the courts of Europe And Uncle Andrea who
had probably loaned the new king of Cyprus a goodly store of Venetian
ducats became quite friendly with the young monarch and gave him much
sage advice

One dayit seemed as if purely by accident but those old Venetians
were both shrewd and farseeingUncle Andrea talking of the glories of
Venice showed to King Giacomo a picture of his niece Catarina Cornaro
then a beautiful girl of fourteen

King Giacomo came of a house that was quick to form friendships and
antipathies loves and hates He fell violently in love with the
pictureso the story goesand expressed to Andrea Cornaro his
desire to see and know the original

That face seemeth strangely familiar Messer Cornaro he said

He held the portrait in his hands and seemed struggling with an
uncertain memory Suddenly his face lighted up and he exclaimed
joyfully

So I have it Messer Cornaro I know your niece

You know her sire echoed the surprised Uncle Andrea

Ay that indeed I do said the king This is the same fair and brave
young maiden who delivered me from a rascal rout of boys on the Grand
Canal at Venice on St Marks Day scarce two years ago And King
Giacomo smiled and bowed at the picture as if it were the living
Catarina instead of her simple portrait

Here now was news for Uncle Andrea And you may be sure he was too good
a Venetian and too loyal a Cornaro not to turn it to the best advantage
So he stimulated the young kings evident inclination as cunningly as
he was able His niece Catarina he assured the king was as good as she
was beautiful and as clever as she was both

But then he declared Venice hath many fair daughters sire whom
the kings choice would honor and Catarina is but a young maid yet
Would it not be wiser when you choose a queen to select some older
donzella for your bride Though it will I can aver be hard to choose
fairer

It is just such halfway opposition that renders nature like that of
this young monarch all the more determined No King Giacomo would have
Catarina and Catarina only for his bride and queen Messer Cornaro
must secure her for him

But shrewd Uncle Andrea still feared the jealousy of his
fellowVenetians Why should the house of Cornaro they would demand
be so openly preferred And so at his suggestion an ambassador was
despatched to Venice soliciting an alliance with the Great Republic
and asking from the senate the hand of some highborn maid of Venice in
marriage for his highness the King of Cyprus But you may be very sure
that the ambassador had special and secret instructions alike from King
Giacomo and from Uncle Andrea just how and whom to choose

The ambassador came to Venice and soon the senate issued its commands
that upon a certain day the noblest and fairest of the daughters of
Veniceone from each of the patrician familiesshould appear in the
great Council Hall of the Ducal Palace in order that the ambassador of
the King of Cyprus might select a fitting bride for his royal master It
reads quite like one of the old fairy stories does it not Only in this
case the dragon who was to take away the fairest maiden as his tribute
was no monster but the brave young king of a lovely island realm

The Palace of the Dogesthe Palazzo Ducale of old Veniceis familiar
to all who have ever seen a picture of the Square of St Marks
the best known spot in that famous City of the Sea It is the low
rectangular richly decorated building with its long row of columns and
arcades that stand out so prominently in photograph and engraving It
has seen many a splendid pageant but it never witnessed a fairer sight
than when on a certain bright day of the year 1468 seventytwo of the
daughters of Venice gorgeous in the rich costumes of that most lavish
city of a lavish age gathered in the great Consiglio or Council Hall

Up the Scala dOro or Golden Staircase built only for the use of
the nobles they came escorted by the ducal guards gleaming in their
richest uniforms The great Council Hall was one mass of color the
splendid dresses of the ladies the scarlet robes of the senators and
high officials of the Republic the imposing vestments of the old doge
Cristofero Moro as he sat in state upon his massive throne and the
bewildering array of the seventytwo candidates for a kings choice
Seventytwo I say but in all that company of puffed and powdered
coifed and combed young ladies standing tall and uncomfortable on
their ridiculously highheeled shoes one alone was simply dressed
and apparently unaffected by the gorgeousness of her companions the
seventysecond and youngest of them all

She was a girl of fourteen Face and form were equally beautiful and
a mass of dark gold hair crowned her queenly head While the other
girls appeared nervous or anxious she seemed unconcerned and her face
wore even a peculiar little smile as if she were contrasting the poor
badgered young prince of St Marks Day with the present King of Cyprus
hunting for a bride Eh via she said to herself t is almost as if
it were a revenge upon us for our former churlishness that he thus now
puts us to shame

The ambassador of Cyprus swarthy of face and stately in bearing
entered the great hall With him came his attendant retinue of Cypriote
nobles Kneeling before the doge the ambassador presented the petition
of his master the King of Cyprus seeking alliance and friendship with
Venice

And the better to secure this and the more firmly to cement it
Eccellenza said the ambassador my lord and master the king doth
crave from your puissant state the hand of some highborn damsel of the
Republic as that of his loving and acknowledged queen

The old doge waved his hand toward the fair and anxious seventytwo

Behold noble sir he said the fairest and noblest of our maidens of
Venice Let your eye seek among these a fitting bride for your lord the
King of Cyprus and it shall be our pleasure to give her to him in such
a manner as shall suit the power and dignity of the State of Venice

Courteous and stately still but with a shrewd and critical eye the
ambassador of Cyprus slowly passed from candidate to candidate with
here a pleasant word and there a look of admiration to this one a
honeyed compliment upon her beauty to that one a bit of praise for her
elegance of dress

How oddly this all sounds to us with our modern ideas of propriety and
good taste It seems a sort of Prize Girl Show does it not Or it is
like a competitive examination for a royal bride

But like too many such examinations this one had already been settled
beforehand The King had decided to whom the prize of his crown should
go and so at the proper time the critical ambassador stopped before a
slight girl of fourteen dressed in a robe of simple white

Donzella mia he said courteously but in a low tone are not you
the daughter of Messer Marco Cornaro the noble merchant of the Via
Merceria

I am my lord the girl replied

My royal master greets you through me he said He recalls the day
when you did give him shelter and he invites you to share with him the
throne of Cyprus Shall this be as he wishes

And the girl with a deep courtesy in acknowledgment of the stately
obeisance of the ambassador said simply That shall be my lord as my
father and his Excellency shall say

The ambassador of Cyprus took the young girls hand and conducting
her through all that splendid company presented her before the doges
throne

Excellency he said Cyprus hath made her choice We present to you
if so it shall please your grace our future queen this fair young
maid Catarina the daughter of the noble Marco Cornaro merchant and
senator of the Republic

What the seventyone disappointed young ladies thought of the Kings
choice or what they said about it when they were safely at home once
more history does not record But history does record the splendors
and display of the ceremonial with which the grayhaired old doge
Cristofero Moro in the great hall of the palace surrounded by the
senators of the Republic and all the rank and power of the State of
Venice formally adopted Catarina as a daughter of the Republic Thus
to the dignity of her fathers house was added the majesty of the
great Republic Her marriage portion was placed at one hundred thousand
ducats and Cyprus was granted on behalf of this daughter of the
Republic the alliance and protection of Venice

The ambassador of Cyprus standing before the altar of St Marks as
the personal representative of his master King Giacomo was married by
proxy to the young Venetian girl while the doge representing her new
father the republic gave her away in marriage and Catarina Cornaro
amid the blessings of the priests the shouts of the people and the
demonstrations of clashing music and waving banners was solemnly
proclaimed Queen of Cyprus of Jerusalem and of Armenia

But the gorgeous display before which even the fabled wonders of the
Arabian Nights were but poor affairs did not conclude here Following
the splendors of the marriage ceremony and the weddingfeast came the
pageant of departure The Grand Canal was ablaze with gorgeous colors
and decorations The broad watersteps of the Piazza of St Mark was
soft with carpets of tapestry and at the foot of the stairs floated
the most beautiful boat in the world the Bucentaur or state gondola
of Venice Its high carved prow and framework were one mass of golden
decorations White statues of the saints carved heads of the lion of
St Mark the doges cap and the emblems of the Republic adorned
it throughout Silken streamers of blue and scarlet floated from its
standards and its sides were draped in velvet hangings of crimson and
royal purple The long oars were scarlet and gold and the rowers were
resplendent in suits of blue and silver A great velvetcovered
throne stood on the upper deck and at its right was a chair of state
glistening with gold

Down the tapestried stairway came the Doge of Venice and resting upon
his arm in a white bridal dress covered with pearls walked the girl
queen Catarina Doge and daughter seated themselves upon their sumptuous
thrones their glittering retinue filled the beautiful boat the scarlet
oars dipped into the water and then with music playing banners
streaming and a grand escort of boats of every conceivable shape
flashing in decoration and gorgeous in mingled colors the bridal train
floated down the Grand Canal on past the outlying islands and between
the great fortresses to where upon the broad Adriatic the galleys were
waiting to take the new Queen to her island kingdom off the shores of
Greece And there in his queer old town of Famagusta built with a
curious commingling of Saracen Grecian and Norman ideas King Giacomo
met his bride

So they were married and for five happy years all went well with the
young King and Queen Then came troubles King Giacomo died suddenly
from a cold caught while hunting so it was said though some averred
that he had been poisoned either by his halfsister Carlotta with whom
he had contended for his throne or by some mercenary of Venice who
desired his realm for that voracious Republic

But if this latter was the case the voracious Republic of Venice was
not to find an easy prey The young Queen Catarina proclaimed her baby
boy King of Cyprus and defied the Great Republic Venice surprised
at this rebellion of its adopted daughter dispatched embassy after
embassy to demand submission But the young mother was brave and stood
boldly up for the rights of her son

But he too died Then Catarina true to the memory of her husband
and her boy strove to retain the throne intact For years she ruled as
Queen of Cyprus despite the threatenings of her home Republic and the
conspiracies of her enemies Her one answer to the demands of Venice
was

Tell the Republic I have determined never to remarry When I am dead
the throne of Cyprus shall go to the State my heir But until that day
I am Queen of Cyprus

Then her brother Giorgio the same who in earlier days had looked down
with her from the Cornaro Palace upon the outcast Prince of Cyprus came
to her as ambassador of the Republic His entreaties and his assurance
that unless she complied with the senates demand the protection of
Venice would be withdrawn and the island kingdom left a prey to Saracen
pirates and African robbers at last carried the day Worn out with
long contending fearful not for herself but for her subjects of
Cyprusshe yielded to the demands of the senate and abdicated in
favor of the Republic

Then she returned to Venice The same wealth of display and ceremonial
that had attended her departure welcomed the return of this obedient
daughter of the Republic now no longer a lighthearted young girl but
a dethroned queen a widowed and childless woman

She was allowed to retain her royal title of Queen of Cypus and a
noble domain was given her for a home in the town of Asola up among the
northern mountains Here in a massive castle she held her court It
was a bright and happy company the home of poetry and music the arts
and all the culture and refinement of that age when learning belonged
to the few and the people were sunk in densest ignorance

Here Titian the great artist painted the portrait of the exiled queen
that has come down to us Here she lived for years sad in her memories
of the past but happy in her helpfulness of others until on her way
to visit her brother Giorgio in Venice she was stricken with a sudden
fever and died in the palace in which she had played as a child

With pomp and display as was the wont of the Great Republic with a
city hung with emblems of mourning and with the solemn strains of
dirge and mass filling the air out from the great hall of the Palazzo
Cornaro on across the heavily draped bridge that spanned the Grand
Canal from the watergate of the palace along the broad piazza crowded
with a silent throng and into the Church of the Holy Apostles the
funeral procession slowly passed The service closed and in the great
Cornaro tomb in the family chapel at last was laid to rest the body
of one who had enjoyed much but suffered morethe sorrowful Queen of
Cyprus the once bright and beautiful Daughter of the Republic

Venice today is mouldy and wasting The palace in which Catarina
Cornaro spent her girlhood is now a pawnbrokers shop The last living
representative of the haughty house of LusignanKings in their day of
Cyprus of Jerusalem and of Armeniais said to be a waiter in a French
cafe So royalty withers and power fades There is no title to nobility
save character and no family pride so unfading as a spotless name But
though palace and family have both decayed the beautiful girl who was
once the glory of Venice and whom great artists loved to paint sends us
across the ages in a flash of regal splendor a lesson of loyalty and
helpfulness This indeed will outlive all their queenly titles and
shows her to us as the brighthearted girl who in spite of sorrow of
trouble and of loss developed into the strong and selfreliant woman




THERESA OF AVILA THE GIRL OF THE SPANISH SIERRAS

Afterward known as St Theresa of Avila AD 1525

It is a stern and gray old city that the sun looks down upon when
once he does show his jolly face above the sawlike ridges of the grim
Guadarrama Mountains in Central Spain a stern and gray old city as well
it may be for it is one of the very old towns of Western EuropeAvila
said by some to have been built by Albula the mother of Hercules nearly
four thousand years ago

Whether or not it was the place in which that baby gymnast strangled
the serpents who sought to kill him in his cradle it is indeed ancient
enough to suit any boy or girl who likes to dig among the relics of
the past For more than eight centuries the same granite walls that
now surround it have lifted their gray ramparts out of the vast and
granitecovered plains that make the country so wild and lonesome while
its eightysix towers and gateways still unbroken and complete tell
of its strength and importance in those faroff days when the Cross
was battling with the Crescent and Christian Spain step by step was
forcing Mohammedan Spain back to the blue Mediterranean and the arid
wastes of Africa from which centuries before the followers of the
Arabian Prophet had come

At the time of our story in the year 1525 this forcing process was
about over Under the relentless measures of Ferdinand and Isabella
with whose story all American children at least should be familiar
the last Moorish stronghold had fallen in the very year in which
Columbus discovered America and Spain from the Pyrenees to the Straits
of Gibraltar acknowledged the mastership of its Christian sovereigns

But the centuries of warfare that had made the Spaniards a fierce and
warlike race had also filled Spain with frowning castles and embattled
towns And such an embattled town was this same city of Avila in which
in 1525 lived the stern and pious old grandee Don Alphonso Sanchez de
Cepeda his sentimental and romanceloving wife the Donna Beatrix and
their twelve sturdy and healthy children

Religious warfare as it is the most bitter and relentless of strifes
is also the most brutal It turns the natures of men and women into
quite a different channel from the one in which the truths they are
fighting for would seek to lead them and of all relentless and brutal
religious wars few have been more bitter than the one that for fully
five hundred years had wasted the land of Spain

To battle for the Cross to gain renown in fights against the
Infidelsas the Moors were then calledto obtain martyrdom among
the followers of Mohammedthese were reckoned by the Christians of
crusading days as the highest honor that life could bring or death
bestow It is no wonder therefore that in a family the father of
which had been himself a fighter of Infidels and the mother a reader
and dreamer of all the romantic stories that such conflicts create the
children also should be full of that spirit of hatred toward a conquered
foe that came from so bitter and longcontinuing a warfare

Don Alphonsos religion had little in it of cheerfulness and love
It was of the stern and pitiless kind that called for sacrifice and
penance and all those uncomfortable and unnecessary forms by which too
many good people even in this more enlightened day think to ease their
troubled consciences or to satisfy the fancied demands of the Good
Father who really requires none of these foolish and most unpleasant
selfpunishments

But such a belief was the rule in Don Alphonsos day and when it could
lay so strong a hold upon grown men and women it would of course
be likely to work in peculiar ways with thoughtful and conscientious
children who understanding little of the real meaning of sacrifice and
penance felt it their duty to do something as proof of their belief

So it came about that little tenyearold Theresa one of the numerous
girls of the Cepeda family thought as deeply of these things as her
small mind was capable She was of a peculiarly sympathetic romantic
and conscientious nature and she felt it her duty to do something
to show her devotion to the faith for which her father had fought so
valiantly and which the nuns and priests who were her teachers so
vigorously impressed upon her

She had been taught that alike the punishment or the glory that must
follow her life on earth were to last forever Forever this was a word
that even a thoughtful little maiden like Theresa could not comprehend
So she sought her mother

Forever how long is forever mother mine she asked

But the Donna Beatrix was just then too deeply interested in the tragic
story of the two lovers Calixto and Melibea in the Senor Fernando de
Rojas tearcompelling story to be able to enter into the discussion of
so deep a question

Forever she said looking up from the thick and crabbed blackletter
pages why forever is forever childalways Pray do not trouble
me with such questions just as I am in the midst of this beautiful
deathscene too

The little girl found she could gain no knowledge from this source and
she feared to question her stern and bigoted old father So she sought
her favorite brother Pedroa bright little fellow of seven who adored
and thoroughly believed in his sister Theresa

To Pedro then Theresa confided her belief that if forever was so long
a time as always it would be most unpleasant to suffer always if
by any chance they should do any thing wrong It would be far better
so argued this little logician to die now and end the problem than to
live and run so great a risk She told him too that as they knew from
their mothers tales the most beautiful the most glorious way to die
was as a martyr among the infidel Moors So she proposed to Pedro that
she and he should not say a word to any one but just start off at once
as crusaders on their own accounts and lose their lives but save their
souls as martyrs among the Moors

The suggestion had all the effect of novelty to the little Pedro and
while he did not altogether relish the idea of losing his life among the
Moors still the possibility of a change presented itself with all the
attractions that the thought of trying something new always has for
children Besides he had great respect for his sisters judgment

Well let us be crusaders he said and perhaps we need not be
martyrs sister I dont think that would be so very pleasant do
you Who knows perhaps we may be victorious crusaders and conquer the
Infidels just as did Ruy Diaz the Cid1 See here Theresa I have my
sword and you can take your cross and we can have such a nice crusade
and may be the infidel Moors will run away from us just as they did from
the Cid and leave us their cities and their gold and treasure Dont you
remember what mother read us how the Cid won Castelon with its silver
and its gold

1 The Cid was the great hero of Spanish romance The stories of his
valor have been the joy of Spaniards old and young for centuries Cid
is a corruption of the Moorish word seyd or said and means master


And the little fellow spouted most valiantly this portion of the famous
poem of the exploits of the Cid the Poema del Cid with the martial
spirit of which stirring rhyme his romantic mother had filled her
children

 Smite smite my knights for mercys sakeon boldly to the
 war
 I am Ruy Diaz of Bivar the Cid Campeador
 Three hundred lances then were couched with pennons
 streaming gay
 Three hundred shields were pierced throughno steel the
 shock might stay
 Three hundred hauberks were torn off in that encounter sore
 Three hundred snowwhite pennons were crimsondyed in
 gore
 Three hundred chargers wandered loosetheir lords were
 overthrown
 The Christians cry St James for Spain the Moormen
 cry Mahoun


Theresa applauded her little brothers eloquent recitation and thought
him a very smart boy but she said rather sadly I fear me it will not
be that way my Pedro for martyrdom means as mother has told us the
giving up of our life rather than bow to the false faith of the Infidel
and thus to save our souls and have a crown of glory

The crown would be very nice I suppose sister said practical young
Pedro especially if it was all so fine as the one they say the
young King Carlos1 wearsEmperor too now is he not Could we be
emperors too sister if we were martyrs and had each a crown But we
must be crusaders first I suppose Come let us go at once

1 King Charles the Fifth was at this time King of Spain and had just
been elected Emperor of Germany


The road from granitewalled Avila to the south is across a wild and
desolate waste frowned down upon on either hand by the savage crests
of the grim sierras of the Guadarrama It winds along gorges and ravines
and rocky riverbeds and has always been even in the days of Spanish
power and glory about as untamed and savagely picturesque a road as one
could well imagine

Along this hard and desolate road only a few days after their
determination had been reached to start upon a crusade the brother and
sister plodded Theresa carried her crucifix and Pedro his toy sword
while in a little wallet at his side were a few bits of food taken from
the home larder This stock of food had of course been taken without
the knowledge of the mother who knew nothing of their crusade and
this therefore furnished for Theresa another sin for which she must
do penance and another reason for the desired martyrdom

They had really only proceeded a few miles into the mountains beyond
Avila but already their sturdy little legs were tired and their stout
little backs were sore Pedro thought crusading not such very great fun
after all he was always hungry and thirsty and Theresa would only let
him take a bite once in a while

Dont you suppose there is a Moorish castle somewhere around here that
we could capture and so get plenty to eat he inquired of his sister
That is what the Cid was always finding Dont you remember how nicely
he got into Alcacer and slew eleven Infidel knights and found ever so
much gold and things to eat This is what he said you know

 On on my knights and smite the foe
 And falter not I pray
 For by the grace of God I trow
 The town is ours this day


O Pedro dear why will you think so much of things to eat groaned
Theresa Do you not know that to be hungry is one way to be a martyr
And besides it is I doubt not our just punishment for having taken
any thing to eat without letting mother know We must suffer and be
strong little brother

Thats just like a girl cried Pedro a trifle scornfully How can we
be strong if we suffer I cant I know

But before Theresa could enter upon an explanation of this most
difficult problemone that has troubled many older heads than little
Pedrosboth the children started in surprise and then involuntarily
shrunk closer to the dark gray rock in whose shadow they were resting
For there not a hundred yards distant coming around a turn in the
road was one of the very Infidels they had come out to meet and
conquer or be martyred by

He was a rather imposinglooking but not a formidable old man His cloak
or mantle of brown stuff was worn and ragged his turban was quite
as dingy but the long white beard that fell upon his breast made his
swarthy face look even fiercer than it really was and the stout staff
with which he helped himself over the uneven road seemed to the little
crusaders some terrible weapon of torture and of martyrdom

But Pedro was a valiant little fellow after all The fighting spirit of
his father the Don burned within him and few little folks of seven know
what caution is He whispered to his sister whose hand he had at first
clutched in terror a word of assurance

Be not afraid sister mine he said Yonder comes the Infidel we have
gone forth to find Do you suppose he has a whole great army following
him Hold up your crucifix and I will strike him with my sword The
castle cant be far away and perhaps we can conquer this old Infidel
and find a good dinner in his castle That s just what the Cid would
have done You know what he said

 Far from our land far from Castile
 We here are banished
 If with the Moors we battle not
 I wot we get no bread

Let us battle with him at once

And before his sister with restraining hand could hold him back the
plucky young crusader flourished his sword furiously and charged down
upon the old Moor who now in turn started in surprise and drew aside
from the path of the determined little warrior

 Now yield thee yield thee pagan prince
 Or die in crimson gore
 I am Ruy Diaz of Bivar
 The Cid Campeador

shouted the little crusader charging against his pagan enemy at a
furious rate

O spare him spare my brother noble emir Let me die in his stead
cried the terrified Theresa not quite so confident now as to the
pleasure of martyrdom

The old man stretched out his staff and stopped the headlong dash of
the boy Then laying a hand lightly on his assailants head he looked
smilingly toward Theresa

Neither prince nor emir am I Christian maiden he said but the poor
Morisco AbdelAman of Cordova seeking my son Ali who men say is
servant to a family in Valladolid Pray you if you have aught to eat
give some to me for I am famishing

This was not exactly martyrdom it was in fact quite the opposite
and the little Theresa was puzzled as to her duty in the matter Pedro
however was not at all undecided

Give our bread and cake to a nasty old Moor he cried I should say
we will not will we sister We need it for ourselves Besides what
dreadful thing is it that the Holy Inquisition does to people who succor
the infidel Moors

Theresa shuddered She knew too well all the stories of the horrible
punishments that the Holy Office known as the Inquisition of Spain
visited upon those who harbored Jews or aided the now degraded Moors
For so complete had been the conquest of the once proud possessors of
Southern Spain that they were usually known only by the contemptuous
title of Moriscoes and were despised and hated by their chivalrous
Christian conquerors

But little Theresa de Cepeda was of so loving and generous a nature that
even the plea of an outcast and despised Morisco moved her to pity From
her earliest childhood she had delighted in helpful and generous deeds
She repeatedly gave away so we are told all her pocketmoney in
charity and any sign of trouble or distress found her ready and anxious
to extend relief There was really a good deal of the angelic in little
Theresa and even the risk of arousing the wrath of the Inquisition
the walls of whose gloomy dungeon in Avila she had so often looked upon
with awe could not withhold her from wishing to help this poor old man
who was hunting for his lost son

Nay brother she said to little Pedro it can be not so very great a
crime to give food to a starving man and much to Pedros disgust she
opened the wallet and emptied their little store of provisions into the
old beggars hand

And wither are ye bound little ones asked this tramp of the long
ago as the children watched their precious dinner disappear behind his
snowy beard

We are on a crusade don Infidel replied Pedro boldly A crusade
against your armies and castles perhaps to capture them and thus gain
the crown of martyrdom

The old Moor looked at them sadly There is scarce need for that my
children he said My people are but slaves their armies and their
castles are lost their beautiful cities are ruined and there is
neither conquest nor martyrdom for Christian youths and maidens to gain
among them Go home my little ones and pray to Allah that you and
yours may never know so much of sorrow and of trouble as do the poor
Moriscoes of Spain this day

This was news to Theresa No martyrdom to be obtained among the Moors
Where then was all the truth of her mothers romanceswhere was all
the wisdom of her fathers savage faith She had always supposed that
the Moors were monsters and djins waiting with great fires and racks
and sharpest cimeters to put to horrible death all young Christians who
came amongst them and now here was one who begged for bread and pleaded
for pity like any common beggar of Avila Evidently something was wrong
in the home stories

As for little Pedro he waxed more valiant as the danger lessened He
whetted his toy sword against the granite rocks and looked savagely at
the old man

You have eaten all my bread don Infidel he said and now you would
lie about your people and your castles You are no beggar you are the
King of Cordova come here in this disguise to spy out the Christians
land I know all about you from my mothers stories So you must die I
shall send your head to our Emperor by my sister here and when he shall
ask her who has done this noble deed she will say just as did Alvar
Fanez to King Alfonso

 My Cid Campeador O king it was who girded brand
 The Paynim king he hath oercome the mightiest in the land
 Plenteous and sovereign is the spoil he from the Moor hath
 won
 This portion honored king and lord he sendeth to your
 throne

So King of Cordova bend down and let me cut off your head

The King of Cordova made no movement of compliance to this gentle
invitation and the headstrong Pedro springing toward him would have
caught him by the beard had not his gentle sister restrained him

I do believe he is no king my Pedro she said but only as he says
a poor Morisco beggar Let us rather try to help him He hath no castles
I am sure and as for his armies

His armies there they come look sister cried little Pedro
breaking into his sisters words now will you believe me and
following his gaze Theresa herself started as she saw dashing down the
mountain highway what looked to her unpractised eye like a whole band of
Moorish cavalry with glimmering lances and streaming pennons

Pedro faced the charge with drawn sword Theresa knelt on the ground
with silver crucifix upraised expecting instant martyrdom while the
old Moorish tramp AbdelAman believing discretion to be the better
part of valor quietly dropped down by the side of the rocky roadway
for well he understood who were these latest comers

The Moorish cavalry which proved to be three Spaniards on horseback
drew up before the young crusaders

So runaways we have found you cried one of them as he recognized
the children Come Theresa what means this folly Whither are you and
Pedro bound


We were even starting for a crusade against the Moor Brother Jago
said Theresa timidly but our Infidel friend herewhy where hath he
gonesays that there are neither Infidel castles nor Moorish armies
now and that therefore we may not be crusaders

But I know that he doth lie Brother Jago cried little Pedro more
valiant still when he saw to what his Moorish cavalry was reduced He
is the King of Cordova come here to spy out the land and I was about
to cut off his head when you did disturb us

Big brother Jago de Cepeda and the two servants of his fathers house
laughed long and loudly

Crusaders and kings he cried why we shall have the Cid himself
here if we do but wait long enough

Hush brother said young Pedro confidentially say it not so
loudly I did tell the Infidel that I was Ruy Diaz of Bivar the Cid
Campeadorand he did believe me

And then the cavalry laughed louder than ever and swooping down
captured the young crusaders and set the truants before them on their
uncomfortable Cordova saddles Then turning around they rode swiftly
back to Avila with the runaways while the old Moor glad to have
escaped rough handling from the Christian riders grasped his staff and
plodded on toward Avila and Valladolid

So the expedition for martyrdom and crusade came to an ignominious
end But the pious desires of little Theresa did not For finding
that martyrdom was out of the question she proposed to her everready
brother that they should become hermits and for days the two children
worked away trying to build a hermitage near their fathers house

But the rough and heavy pieces of granite with which they sought to
build their hermitage proved more than they could handle and their
knowledge of masonwork was about as imperfect as had been their
familiarity with crusading and the country of the Moors The stones
that we piled one upon another wrote Theresa herself in later years
immediately fell down and so it came to pass that we found no means of
accomplishing our wish

The pluck and piety however that set this conscientious and
sympathetic little girl to such impossible tasks were certain to blossom
into something equally hard and unselfish when she grew to womanhood
And so it proved Her muchloved but romancereading mother died when
she was twelve years old and Theresa felt her loss keenly

She was a very clever and ambitious girl and with a mothers guiding
hand removed she became impatient under the restraints which her
stern old father Don Alphonso placed upon her At sixteen she was an
impetuous worldlyminded and very vain though very dignified young
lady Then her father fearful as to her future sent her to a convent
with orders that she should be kept in strict seclusion

Such a punishment awoke all the feelings of conscientiousness and
selfconviction that had so influenced her when she was a little girl
and Theresa left to her own thoughts first grew morbid and then fell
sick

During her sickness she resolved to become a nun persuaded her
everfaithful brother Pedro to become a friar and when Don Alphonso
their father refused his consent the brother and sister repeating the
folly of their childhood again ran away from home

Then their father seeing the uselessness of resistance consented and
Theresa at the age of twenty entered a convent in Avila and became a
nun in what was known as the Order of the Carmelites

The life of these nuns was strict secluded and silent but the
conscientious nature of Theresa found even the severities of this lonely
life not sufficiently hard and attaining to a position of influence in
the order she obtained permission from the Pope in 1562 to found a new
order which should be even more strict in its rules and therefore so
she believed more helpful Thus was founded the Order of Barefooted
Carmelites a body of priests and nuns who have in their peculiar way
accomplished very much for charity gentleness and selfhelp in the
world and whose schools and convents have been instituted in all parts
of the earth

Theresa de Cepeda died in 1582 greatly beloved and revered for her
strict but gentle life her great and helpful charities and her sincere
desire to benefit her fellowmen After her death so great was the
respect paid her that she was canonized as it is called that is
lifted up as an example of great goodness to the world and she is
today known and honored among devout Roman Catholics as St Theresa of
Avila

Whatever we may think of the peculiar way in which her life was spent
however we may regard the story of her troubles with her conscience her
understanding of what she deemed her duty and her sinking of what might
have been a happy and joyous life in the solitude and severity of a
convent we cannot but think of her as one who wished to do right and
who desired above all else to benefit the world in which she lived and
labored Her story is that of a most extraordinary and remarkable woman
who devoted her life to what she deemed the thing demanded of her
Could we not all of us profitably attempt to live in something like a
kindred spirit to that helpful and unselfish one that actuated this girl
of the Spanish sierras

Here and there is born a Saint Theresa says George Eliot foundress
of nothing whose loving heartbeats and sobs after an unattained
goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances instead of
centring in some longrecognizable deed

But if a girl or boy desiring to do right will disregard the
hindrances and not simply sit and sob after an unattained goodnessif
instead they will but do the duty nearest at hand manfully and
well the reward will come in something even more desirable than a
longrecognizable deed It will come in the very selfgratification
that will at last follow every act of courtesy of friendliness and
of selfdenial and such a life will be of more real value to the world
than all the deeds of all the crusaders or than even the stern and
austere charities of a Saint Theresa




ELIZABETH OF TUDOR THE GIRL OF THE HERTFORD MANOR

Afterward Queen Elizabeth of England the Good Queen Bess AD
1548

The ironshod hoofs of the big gray courser rang sharply on the
frozen ground as beneath the creaking boughs of the longarmed oaks
Launcelot Crue the Lord Protectors fleetest courserman galloped
across the Hertford fells or hills and reined up his horse within the
great gates of Hatfield manorhouse

From the Lord Protector he said and Master Avery Mitchell the
feodary1 who had been closely watching for this same courserman
for several anxious hours took from his hands a scroll on which was
inscribed

1 An old English term for the guardian of certain wards of the
stateyoung persons under guardianship of the government


To Avery Mitchell feodary of the Wards in Herts at Halfield House
From the Lord Protector THESE

And next the courserman in secrecy unscrewed one of the bullion
buttons on his buff jerkin and taking from it a scrap of paper handed
this also to the watchful feodary Then his mission ended he repaired
to the buttery to satisfy his lusty English appetite with a big dish
of pasty followed by ale and wardens as certain hard pears used
chiefly for cooking were called in those days while the cautious
Avery Mitchell unrolling the scrap of paper read

In secrecy THESE Under guise of mummers place a halfscore good men
and true in your Yuletide maskyng Well armed and safely conditioned
They will be there who shall command Look for the green dragon of
Wantley On your allegiance This from ye wit who


Scarcely had the feodary read reread and then destroyed this secret
and singular missive when the Ho hollo of Her Grace the Princess
outriders rang on the crisp December air and there galloped up to the
broad doorway of the manorhouse a gayly costumed train of lords and
ladies with huntsmen and falconers and yeomen following on behind
Central in the group flushed with her hard gallop through the wintry
air a young girl of fifteen tall and trim in figure sat her horse
with the easy grace of a practised and confident rider Her long velvet
habit was deeply edged with fur and both kirtle and headgear were of
a rich purple tinge while from beneath the latter just peeped a heavy
coil of sunny golden hair Her face was fresh and fair as should be
that of any young girl of fifteen but its expression was rather that of
high spirits and of heedless and impetuous moods than of simple maidenly
beauty

Tillyvally my lord she cried dropping her bridlerein into the
hands of a waiting groom t was my race today was it not Odds fish
man she cried out sharply to the attendant groom be ye easier with
Rolands bridle there One beast of his gentle mettle were worth a score
of clumsy varlets like to you Well said I not right my Lord Admiral
is not the race fairly mine I ask and careless in act as in speech
she gave the Lord Admirals horse as she spoke so sharp a cut with her
riding whip as to make the big brute rear in sudden surprise and
almost unhorse its rider while an unchecked laugh came from its fair
tormentor

Good faith Mistress answered Sir Thomas Seymour the Lord High
Admiral gracefully swallowing his exclamation of surprise your
ladyship hath fairly won and sure hath no call to punish both myself
and my good Selim here by such unwarranted chastisement Will your grace
dismount

And vaulting from his seat he gallantly extended his hand to help the
young girl from her horse while on the same instant another in her
train a handsome young fellow of the girls own age knelt on the
frozen ground and held her stirrup

But this independent young maid would have none of their courtesies
Ignoring the outstretched hands of both the man and boy she sprang
lightly from her horse and as she did so with a sly and sudden push
of her dainty foot she sent the kneeling lad sprawling backward while
her merry peal of laughter rang out as an accompaniment to his downfall

Without your help my lordswithout your help so please you both
she cried Why Dudley she exclaimed in mock surprise as she threw
a look over her shoulder at the prostrate boy are you there Beshrew
me though you do look like one of goodman Rogers Dorking cocks in
the poultry yonder so red and ruffled of feather do you seem There
see now I do repent me of my discourtesy You Sir Robert shall squire
me to the hall and Lord Seymour must even content himself with playing
the gallant to good Mistress Ashley and leaning on the arm of the
now pacified Dudley the selfwilled girl tripped lightly up the
entrancesteps

Selfwilled and thoughtlesseven rude and hoydenishwe may think her
in these days of gentler manners and more guarded speech But those were
less refined and cultured times than these in which we live and
the rough uncurbed nature of Kinge Henrye the viii of Most Famous
Memorye as the old chronicles term the bluff King Hal reappeared to
a noticeable extent in the person of his second child the daughter
of illfated Anne Boleynmy ladyes grace the Princess Elizabeth of
England

And yet we should be readier to excuse this impetuous young princess of
three hundred years ago than were even her associates and enemies For
enemies she had poor child envious and vindictive ones who sought to
work her harm Varied and unhappy had her young life already been Born
amid splendid hopes in the royal palace of Greenwich called Elizabeth
after that grandmother the fair heiress of the House of York whose
marriage to a prince of the House of Lancaster had ended the long and
cruel War or the Roses she had been welcomed with the peal of bells and
the boom of cannon and christened with all the regal ceremonial of King
Henrys regal court Then when scarcely three years old disgraced by
the wicked murder of her mother cast off and repudiated by her brutal
father and only received again to favor at the christening of her baby
brother passing her childish days in grim old castles and a wicked
courtshe found herself at thirteen fatherless as well as
motherless and at fifteen cast on her own resources the sport of mens
ambitions and of conspirators schemes Today the girl of fifteen
tenderly reared shielded from trouble by a mothers watchful love and a
fathers loving care can know but little of the dangers that compassed
this princess of England the Lady Elizabeth Deliberately separated
from her younger brother the king by his unwise and selfish
counsellors hated by her elder sister the Lady Mary as the daughter
of the woman who had made HER mothers life so miserable she was even
in her manorhome of Hatfield where she should have been most secure
in still greater jeopardy For this same Lord Seymour of Sudleye who
was at once Lord High Admiral of England uncle to the king and brother
of Somerset the Lord Protector had by fair promises and lavish gifts
bound to his purpose this defenceless girls only protectors Master
Parry her cofferer or steward and Mistress Katherine Ashley her
governess And that purpose was to force the young princess into a
marriage with himself so as to help his schemes of treason against the
Lord Protector and get into his own hands the care of the boy king and
the government of the realm It was a bold plot and if unsuccessful
meant attainder and death for high treason but Seymour ambitious
reckless and unprincipled thought only of his own desires and cared
little for the possible ruin into which he was dragging the unsuspecting
and orphaned daughter of the king who had been his ready friend and
patron

So matters stood at the period of our store on the eve of the Christmas
festivities of 1548 as on the arm of her boy escort Sir Robert
Dudley gentleman usher at King Edwards court and years after the
famous Earl of Leicester of Queen Elizabeths day the royal maiden
entered the hall of Hatfield House And within the great hall she was
greeted by Master Parry her cofferer Master Runyon her yeoman of the
robes and Master Mitchell the feodary Then with a low obeisance the
feodary presented her the scroll which had been brought him posthaste
by Launcelot Crue the courserman

What good Master Avery exclaimed Elizabeth as she ran her eye over
the scroll you to be Lord of Misrule and Master of the Revels And by
my Lord of Somersets own appointing I am right glad to learn it

And this is what she read

Imprimis1 I give leave to Avery Mitchell feodary gentleman to be
Lord of Misrule of all good orders at the Manor of Hatfield during the
twelve days of Yuletide And also I give free leave to the said Avery
Mitchell to command all and every person or persons whatsoever as well
servants as others to be at his command whensoever be shall sound his
trumpet or music and to do him good service as though I were present
myself at their perils I give full power and authority to his lordship
to break all locks bolts bars doors and latches to come at all
those who presume to disobey his lordships commands God save the King

SOMERSET


1 A Latin term signifying in the first place or to commence with
and used as the opening of legal or official directions


It was Christmas Eve The great hall of Hatfield House gleamed with
the light of many candles that flashed upon the sconce and armor and
polished floor Holly and mistletoe rosemary and bay and all the
decorations of an oldtime English Christmas were tastefully arranged
A burst of laughter ran through the hall as through the ample doorway
and down the broad stair trooped the Motley train of the Lord of
Misrule to open the Christmas revels A fierce and ferociouslooking
fellow was he with his great green mustache and his ogrelike face His
dress was a gorgeous particolored jerkin and halfhose trunks ruff
slouchboots of Cordova leather and high befeathered steeple hat His
long staff topped with a fools head cap and bells rang loudly on
the floor as preceded by his diminutive but pompous page he led his
train around and around the great hall lustily singing the chorus

 Like prince and king he leads the ring
 Right merrily we go Sing heytrix trimgotrix
 Under the mistletoe


A menagerie let loose or the most dyspeptic of afterdinner dreams
could not be more bewildering than was this motley train of the Lord
of Misrule Giants and dwarfs dragons and griffins hobbyhorses and
goblins Robin Hood and the Grand Turk bears and boars and fantastic
animals that never had a name boys and girls men and women in every
imaginable costume and devicearound and around the hall they went
still ringing out the chorus

 Sing heytrix trimgotrix
 Under the mistletoe


Then standing in the centre of his court the Lord of Misrule bade
his herald declare that from Christmas Eve to Twelfth Night he was
Lord Supreme that with his magic art he transformed all there into
children and charged them on their fealty to act only as such I
absolve them all from wisdom he said I bid them be just wise enough
to make fools of themselves and do decree that none shall sit apart in
pride and eke in selfsufficiency to laugh at others and then the fun
commenced

Off in stately Whitehall in the palace of the boy king her brother
the revels were grander and showier but to the young Elizabeth not yet
skilled in all the stiffness of the royal court the Yuletide feast
at Hatfield House brought pleasure enough and so seated at her
hollytrimmed virginalthat greatgreatgrandfather of the piano
of todayshe whose rare skill as a musician has come down to us
wouldwhen wearied with her prankes and japestap through some
fitting Christmas carol or that older lay of the Yuletide Mumming

To shorten winters sadness see where the folks with gladness Disguised
are all acoming right wantonly amumming

 Fala
 Whilst youthful sports are lasting to feasting turn our fasting
 With revels and with wassails make grief and care our vassals
 Fala

The Yulelog had been noisily dragged in to the firing and as the
big sparks raced up the wide chimney the boars head and the tankard
of sack the great Christmas candle and the Christmas pie were escorted
around the room to the flourish of trumpets and welcoming shouts the
Lord of Misrule with a wave of his staff was about to give the order
for all to unmask when suddenly there appeared in the circle a new
charactera great green dragon as fierce and ferocious as well could
be from his pasteboard jaws to his curling canvas tail The green
dragon of Wantley Terrified urchins backed hastily away from his
horrible jaws and the Lord of Misrule gave a sudden and visible start
The dragon himself scarce waiting for the surprise to subside waved
his paw for silence and said in a hollow pasteboardy voice

Most noble Lord of Misrule before your feast commences and the masks
are doffd may we not as that which should give good appetite to
allwith your lordships permit and that of my ladys gracetell
each some wonderfilling tale as suits the goodly time of Yule Here
be stout maskers can tell us strange tales of fairies and goblins
or perchance of the foreign folk with whom they have trafficked in
Calicute and Affrica Barbaria Perew and other diverse lands and
countries oversea And after they have ended then will I essay a tale
that shall cap them all so past belief shall it appear

The close of the dragons speech of course made them all the more
curious and the Lady Elizabeth did but speak for all when she said I
pray you good Sir Dragon let us have your tale first We have had enow
of Barbaria and Perew If that yours may be so wondrous let us hear it
even now and then may we decide

As your ladys grace wishes said the dragon But methinks when you
have heard me through you would that it had been the last or else not
told at all

Your lordship of Misrule and my ladys grace must know began the
dragon that my story though a short is a startling one Once on a
time there lived a king who though but a boy did by Gods grace
in talent industry perseverance and knowledge surpass both his own
years and the belief of men And because he was good and gentle alike
and conditioned beyond the measure of his years he was the greater prey
to the wicked wiles of traitorous men And one such high in the kings
court thought to work him ill and to carry out his ends did wantonly
awaken seditious and rebellious intent even among the kings kith
and kin whom lie traitorously sought to wedhis royal and younger
sisternay start not my ladys grace exclaimed the dragon quickly
as Elizabeth turned upon him a look of sudden and haughty surprise All
is known And this is the ending of my wondrous tale My Lord Seymour
of Sudleye is this day taken for high treason and haled1 to the Tower
They of your own household are held as accomplice to the Lord Admirals
wicked intent and you Lady Elizabeth Tudor are by order of the
council to be restrained in prison wards in this your manor of Hatfield
until such time as the kings Majesty and the honorable council shall
decide This on your allegiance

1 Haleddragged forcibly conveyed


The cry of terror that the dragons words awoke died into silence as
the Lady Elizabeth rose to her feet flushed with anger

Is this a fable or the posy of a ring Sir Dragon she said sharply
Do you come to try or tempt me or is this perchance but some part of
my Lord of Misrules Yuletide mumming Sblood sir only cravens sneak
behind masks to strike and threaten Have off your disguise if you be
a true man or by my word as Princess of England he shall bitterly rue
the day who dares to befool the daughter of Henry Tudor

As you will then my lady said the dragon Do you doubt me now
and tearing off his pasteboard wrapping he stood disclosed before
them all as the grim Sir Robert Trywhitt chief examiner of the Lord
Protectors council Move not at your peril he said as a stir in the
throng seemed to indicate the presence of some brave spirits who would
have shielded their young princess Master Feodary bid your varlets
stand to their arms

And at a word from Master Avery Mitchell late Lord of Misrule there
flashed from beneath the cloaks of certain tall figures on the circles
edge the halberds of the guard The surprise was complete The Lady
Elizabeth was a prisoner in her own manorhouse and the Yuletide
revels had reached a sudden and sorry ending

And yet once again under this false accusation did the hot spirit of
the Tudors flame in the face and speech of the Princess Elizabeth

Sir Robert Trywhitt cried the brave young girl these be but lying
rumors that do go against my honor and my fealty God knoweth they be
shameful slanders sir for the which besides the desire I have to see
the Kings Majesty I pray you let me also be brought straight before
the court that I may disprove these perjured tongues

But her appeal was not granted For months she was kept close prisoner
at Hatfield House subject daily to most rigid crossexamination by Sir
Robert Trywhitt for the purpose of implicating her if possible in the
Lord Admirals plot But all in vain and at last even Sir Robert gave
up the attempt and wrote to the council that the Lady Elizabeth hath a
good wit and nothing is gotten of her but by great policy

Lord Seymour of Sudleye was beheaded for treason on Tower Hill and
others implicated in his plots were variously punished but even
great policy cannot squeeze a lie out of the truth and Elizabeth was
finally declared free of the stain of treason

Experience which is a hard teacher often brings to light the best that
is in us It was so in this case For as one writer says The long and
harassing ordeal disclosed the splendid courage the reticence the rare
discretion which were to carry the Princess through many an awful peril
in the years to come Probably no event of her early girlhood went so
far toward making a woman of Elizabeth as did this miserable affair

Within ten years thereafter the Lady Elizabeth ascended the throne
of England Those ten years covered many strange events many varying
fortunesthe death of her brother the boy King Edward the sad tragedy
of Lady Jane Grey Wyatts rebellion the tanners revolt and all the
long horror of the reign of Bloody Mary You may read of all this in
history and may see how through it all the young princess grew still
more firm of will more selfreliant wise and strong developing all
those peculiar qualities that helped to make her Englands greatest
queen and one of the most wonderful women in history But through
all her long and most historic lifea life of over seventy years
fortyfive of which were passed as Englands queenscarce any incident
made so lasting an impression upon her as when in Hatfield House the
first shock of the false charge of treason fell upon the thoughtless
girl of fifteen in the midst of the Christmas revels




CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN THE GIRL OF THE NORTHERN FIORDS

AD 1636

There were tears and trouble in Stockholm there was sorrow in
every house and hamlet in Sweden there was consternation throughout
Protestant Europe Gustavus Adolphus was dead The Lion of the North
had fallen on the bloody and victorious field of Lutzen and only a very
small girl of six stood as the representative of Swedens royalty

The States of Swedenthat is the representatives of the different
sections and peoples of the kingdomgathered in haste within the
Riddarhaus or Hall of Assembly in Stockholm There was much anxious
controversy over the situation The nation was in desperate strait and
some were for one thing and some were for another There was even talk
of making the government a republic like the state of Venice and the
supporters of the king of Poland cousin to the dead King Gustavus
openly advocated his claim to the throne

But the Grand Chancellor Axel Oxenstiern one of Swedens greatest
statesmen acted promptly

Let there be no talk between us he said of Venetian republics or
of Polish kings We have but one kingthe daughter of the immortal
Gustavus

Then up spoke one of the leading representatives of the peasant class
Lars Larsson the deputy from the western fiords

Who is this daughter of Gustavus he demanded How do we know this
is no trick of yours Axel Oxenstiern How do we know that King Gustavus
has a daughter We have never seen her

You shall see her at once replied the Chancellor and leaving the
Hall for an instant he returned speedily leading a little girl by
the hand With a sudden movement he lifted her to the seat of the high
silver throne that could only be occupied by the kings of Sweden

Swedes behold your king

Lars Larsson the deputy pressed close to the throne on which the small
figure perched silent yet with a defiant little look upon her face

She hath the face of the Grand Gustavus he said Look brothers the
nose the eyes the very brows are his

Aye said Oxenstiern and she is a soldiers daughter I myself did
see her when scarce three years old clap her tiny hands and laugh
aloud when the guns of Calmar fortress thundered a salute She
must learn to bear it said Gustavus our king she is a soldiers
daughter

Hail Christina shouted the assembly won by the proud bearing of the
little girl and by her likeness to her valiant father We will have her
and only her for our queen

Better yet brothers cried Lars Larsson now her most loyal
supporter she sits upon the throne of the kings let her be proclaimed
King of Sweden

And so it was done And with their wavering loyalty kindled into a
sudden flame the States of Sweden gave a mighty shout and cried as
one man Hail Christina King of Sweden

There was strong objection in Sweden to the rule of a woman and the
education of this little girl was rather that of a prince than of a
princess She was taught to ride and to shoot to hunt and to fence
to undertake all of a boys exercises and to endure all a boys
privations She could bring down a hare at the first shot from the
back of a galloping horse she could outride the most expert huntsman in
her train

So she grew from childhood into girlhood and at thirteen was as bold
and fearless as wilful and selfpossessed as any young fellow of
twentyone But besides all this she was a wonderful scholar indeed
she would be accounted remarkable even in these days of bright
girlgraduates At thirteen she was a thorough Greek scholar she
was learned in mathematics and astronomy the classics history and
philosophy and she acquired of her own accord German Italian Spanish
and French

Altogether this girl Queen of the North was as strange a compound of
scholar and hoyden pride and carelessness ambition and indifference
culture and rudeness as ever before her time or since were combined
in the nature of a girl of thirteen And it is thus that our story finds
her

One raw October morning in the year 1639 there was stir and excitement
at the palace in Stockholm A courier had arrived bearing important
dispatches to the Council of Regents which governed Sweden during the
minority of the Queen and there was no one to officially meet him

Closely following the lackey who received him the courier strode into
the councilroom of the palace But the councilroom was vacant

It was not a very elegant apartment this councilroom of the palace
of the kings of Sweden Although a royal apartment its appearance was
ample proof that the art of decoration was as yet unknown in Sweden The
room was untidy and disordered the counciltable was strewn with the
ungathered litter of the last days council and even the remains of a
coarse lunch mingled with all this clutter The uncomfortablelooking
chairs all were out of place and above the table was a sort of
temporary canopy to prevent the dust and spiders webs upon the ceiling
from dropping upon the councillors

The courier gave a sneering look upon this evidence that the refinement
and culture which marked at least the palaces and castles of other
European countries were as yet little considered in Sweden Then
important and impatient he turned to the attendant Well he said
and is there none here to receive my dispatches They call forhouf
so what manners are these

What manners indeed The courier might well ask this For plump against
him as he spoke dashed first a girl and then a boy who had darted
from somewhere into the councilchamber Too absorbed in their own
concerns to notice who if any one was in the room they had run
against and very nearly upset the astonished bearer of dispatches
Still more astonished was he when the girl using his body as a barrier
against her pursuer danced and dodged around him to avoid being caught
by her pursuera finelooking young lad of about her own ageKarl
Gustav her cousin The scandalized bearer of dispatches to the Swedish
Council of Regents shook himself free from the girls strong grasp and
seizing her by the shoulder demanded sternly

How now young mistress Is this seemly conduct toward a stranger and
an imperial courier

The girl now for the first time noticed the presence of a stranger Too
excited in her mad dash into the room to distinguish him from one of
the palace servants she only learned the truth by the couriers harsh
words A sudden change came over her She drew herself up haughtily and
said to the attendant

And who is this officious stranger Klas

The tone and manner of the question again surprised the courier and he
looked at the speaker amazed What he saw was an attractive young girl
of thirteen short of stature with bright hazel eyes a vivacious face
now almost stern in its expression of pride and haughtiness A mans
fur cap rested upon the mass of tangled lightbrown hair which tied
imperfectly with a simple knot of ribbon fell down upon her neck Her
short dress of plain gray stuff hung loosely about a rather trim figure
and a black scarf carelessly tied encircled her neck In short he
saw a rather pretty carelessly dressed healthy and just now very
haughtylooking young girl who seemed more like a boy in speech and
mannersand one who needed to be disciplined and curbed

Again the question came Who is this man and what seeks he here Klas
I ask

T is a courier with dispatches for the council Madam replied the
man

Give me the dispatches said the girl I will attend to them

You indeed The courier laughed grimly The dispatches from the
Emperor of Germany are for no hairbrained maid to handle These are to
be delivered to the Council of Regents alone

I will have naught of councils or regents Sir Courier save when it
pleases me said the girl tapping the floor with an angry foot Give
me the dispatches I sayI am the King of Sweden

Youa girlking was all that the astonished courier could stammer
out Then as the real facts dawned upon him he knelt at the feet of
the young queen and presented his dispatches

Withdraw sir said Christina taking the papers from his hand with
but the scant courtesy of a nod we will read these and return a
suitable answer to your master

The courier withdrew still dazed at this strange turn of affairs and
Christina leaning carelessly against the counciltable opened the
dispatches

Suddenly she burst into a merry but scarcely ladylike laugh Ha
ha ha this is too rare a joke Karl she cried Lord Chancellor
Mathias Torstenson she exclaimed as these members of her council
entered the apartment what think you Here come dispatches from the
Emperor of Germany begging that you my council shall consider the
wisdom of wedding me to his son and thereby closing the war His son
indeed Ferdinand the Craven

And yet Madam suggested the wise Oxenstiern it is a matter that
should not lightly be cast aside In time you must needs be married The
constitution of the kingdom doth oblige you to

Oblige and the young girl turned upon the grayheaded chancellor
almost savagely Oblige and who Sir Chancellor upon earth shall
OBLIGE me to do so if I do it not of mine own will Say not OBLIGE to
me

This was vigorous language for a girl of scarce fourteen but it was
Christinas way one with which both the Council and the people soon
grew familiar It was the Vasa1 nature in her and it was always
prominent in this spirited young girlthe last descendant of that
masterful house

1 Vasa was the family name of her father and the ancient king of
Sweden


But now the young Prince Karl Gustavus had something to say

Ah cousin mine and he laid a strong though boyish hand upon the
young girls arm What need for couriers or dispatches that speak of
suitors for your hand Am not I to be your husband From babyhood you
have so promised me

Christina again broke into a loud and merry laugh

Hark to the little burgomaster1 she cried much travel hath made
him I do fear me soft in heart and head Childish promises Karl Let
such things be forgotten now You are to be a soldierI a queen

1 Prince Charles Gustavus afterward Charles XI King of Sweden and
father of the famous Charles XII was cousin to Christina He was short
and thickset and so like a little Dutchman that Christina often called
him the little burgomaster At the time of this sketch he had just
returned from a year of travel through Europe


And yet Madam said Mathias her tutor all Europe hath for years
regarded Prince Karl as your future husband

And what care I for that demanded the girl hotly Have done have
done sirs You do weary me with all this Let us to the hunt Axel
Dagg did tell me of a fine roebuck in the Maelar woods See you to the
courier of the Emperor and to his dispatches Lord Chancellor I care
not what you tell him if you do but tell him no And stay where is
that round little Dutchman Van Beunigen whom you did complain but
yesterday was sent among us by his government to oppose the advices
of our English friends He is a greater scholar than horseman or I
mistake Let us take him in our huntingparty Karl and see to it that
he doth have one of our choicest horses

The girls mischief was catching Her cousin dropped his serious look
and seeking the Dutch envoy with due courtesy invited him to join the
Queens hunt

Give him black Hannibal Jous Christina had said to her groom and
when the Dutch envoy Van Beunigen came out to join the huntingparty
too much flattered by the invitation to remember that he was a poor
horseman Jous the groom held black Hannibal in unsteady check while
the big horse champed and fretted and the huntingparty awaited the new
member

But Jous the groom noted the Dutchmans somewhat alarmed look at the
big black animal

Would it not be well good sir he said that you do choose some
steadier animal than Hannibal here I pray you let me give you one less
restive So Bror Andersson he called to one of the undergrooms
let the noble envoy have your cob and take you back Hannibal to the
stables

But no the envoy of the States of Holland would submit to no such
change He ride a servants horse indeed

Why sirrah groom he said to goodhearted Jous I would have you
know that I am no novice in the equestrian art Far from it man I
have read every treatise on the subject from Xenophon downward and what
horse can know more than I

So friendly Jous had nothing more to say but hoisted the puffedup
Dutch scholar into the high saddle and away galloped the hunt toward
the Maelar woods

As if blind to his own folly Van Beunigen the envoy placed himself
near to the young Queen and Christina full of her own mischief began
gravely to compliment him on his horsemanship and suggested a gallop

Alas fatal moment For while he yet swayed and jolted upon the back of
the restive Hannibal and even endeavored to discuss with the fair young
scholar who rode beside him the Melanippe of Euripides the same fair
scholarwho in spite of all her Greek learning was only a mischievous
and sometimes very rude young girlfaced him with a sober countenance

Good Herr Van Beunigen she said your Greek is truly as smooth as
your face But it seems to me you do not sufficiently catch the spirit
of the poets lines commmencing

 gr andrwn de polloi tou gelwtos ouneka1

I should rather say that gr tou gelwtos should be

1 The commencement of an extract from the Melanippe of Euripides
meaning To raise vain laughter many exercise the arts of satire


Just what gr tou gelwtos should be she never declared for as the
envoy of Holland turned upon her a face on which Greek learning and
anxious horsemanship struggled with one another Christina slyly touched
black Hannibal lightly with her ridingwhip

Light as the touch was however it was enough The unruly horse reared
and plunged The startled scholar with a cry of terror flung up his
hands and then clutched black Hannibal around the neck Thus in the
manner of John Gilpin

 His horse who never in that way
 Had handled been before
 What thing upon his back had got
 Did wonder more and more

 Away went Gilpin neck or nought
 Away went hat and wig
 He never dreamt when he set out
 Of running such a rig


Minus hat and wig too the poor envoy dashed up the Maelar highway
while Christina laughing loudly galloped after him in a mad race
followed by all her huntingparty

The catastrophe was not far away The black horse like the illtempered
bronchos of our western plains bucked suddenly and over his
head like a flash went the discomfited Dutchman In an instant Greek
learning and Dutch diplomacy lay sprawling in a Swedish roadway from
which Jous the groom speedily lifted the groaning wouldbe horseman

Even in her zeal for study really remarkable in so young a girl
Christina could not forego her misguided love of power and her tendency
to practical joking and one day she even made two grave philosophers
who were holding a profound discussion in her presence over some deep
philosophic subject suddenly cease their arguments to play with her at
battledore and shuttlecock

A girlhood of uncontrolled power such as hers could lead but to one
result Selfgratification is the worst form of selfishness and
never can work good to any one Although she was a girl of wonderful
capabilities of the blood of famous kings and conquerors giving such
promises of greatness that scholars and statesmen alike prophesied for
her a splendid future Christina Queen of Sweden made only a failure
of her life

At eighteen she had herself formally crowned as KING of Sweden But at
twentyfive she declared herself sick and tired of her duties as queen
and at twentyeight at the height of her power and fame she actually
did resign her throne in favor of her cousin Prince Karlpublicly
abdicated and at once left her native land to lead the life of a
disappointed wanderer

The story of this remarkable woman is one that holds a lesson for
all Eccentric careless and fearless handsome witty and learned
ambitious shrewd and visionaryshe was one of the strangest
compounds of unlikes to be met with in history

She deliberately threw away a crown wasted a life that might have been
helpful to her subjects regarded only her own selfish and personal
desires and died a prematurely old woman at sixtyfive unloved and
unhonored

Her story if it teaches any thing assures us that it is always best
to have in youth whether as girl or boy the guidance and direction
of some will that is acknowledged and respected Natures unformed or
overindulged with none to counsel or command generally go wrong
A mothers love a fathers care thesethough young people may not
always read them arightare needed for the moulding of character while
to every bright young girl historic or unhistoric princess or peasant
Swedish queen or modern American maiden will it at last be apparent
that the right way is always the way of modesty and gentleness of high
ambitions perhaps but always and everywhere of thoughtfulness for
others and kindliness to all




MATAOKA OF POWHATAN THE GIRL OF THE VIRGINIA FORESTS

Generally known as The Princess Pocahontas AD 1607

Throughout that portion of the easterly United States where the noble
bay called the Chesapeake cuts Virginia in two and where the James
broadest of all the rivers of the Old Dominion rolls its glittering
waters toward the sea there lived years ago a notable race of men

For generations they had held the land and though their clothing was
scanty and their customs odd they possessed many of the elements
of character that are esteemed noble and had they been left to
themselves they might have progressedso people who have studied into
their character now believeinto a fairly advanced stage of what is
known as barbaric civilization

They lived in long low houses of bark and boughs each house large
enough to accommodate perhaps from eighty to a hundred personstwenty
families to a house These long houses were therefore much the same
in purpose as are the tenementhouses of today save that the tenements
of that faroff time were all on the same floor and were open closets
or stalls about eight feet wide furnished with bunks built against
the wall and spread with deerskin robes for comfort and covering
These flats or stalls were arranged on either side of a broad central
passageway and in this passageway at equal distances apart fire
pits were constructed the heat from which would warm the bodies and
cook the dinners of the occupants of the long house each fire serving
the purpose of four tenements or families

In their mode of life these peopletall wellmade attractive and
copperycolored folkwere what is now termed communists that is they
lived from common stores and had all an equal share in the land and
its yieldthe products of their vegetable gardens their hunting and
fishing expeditions their home labors and their household goods

Their method of government was entirely democratic No one in any
household was better off or of higher rank than his brothers or
sisters Their chiefs were simply men and sometimes women who had been
raised to leadership by the desire and vote of their associates but who
possessed no special authority or power except such as was allowed
them by the general consent of their comrades in view of their wisdom
bravery or ability They lived in fact as one great family bound
in close association by their habits of life and their family
relationships and they knew no such unnatural distinction as king or
subject lord or vassal

Around their long bark tenements stretched carefully cultivated fields
of corn and pumpkins the trailing bean the fullbunched grapevine the
juicy melon and the bigleafed tabah or tobacco

The field work was performed by the women not from any necessity of a
slavish condition or an enforced obedience but because where the men
and boys must be warriors and hunters the women and girls felt that it
was their place and their duty to perform such menial labor as to their
unenlightened nature seemed hardly suitable to those who were to become
chiefs and heroes

These sturdy forestfolk of old Virginia who had reached that state of
human advance midway between savagery and civilization that is known
as barbarism were but a small portion of that redskinned vigorous
and most interesting race familiar to us under their general but
wronglyused name of Indians They belonged to one of the largest
divisions of this barbaric race known the Algonquin familya
division created solely by a similarity of language and of
bloodrelationshipsand were therefore of the kindred of the Indians
of Canada of New England and of Pennsylvania of the valley of the
Ohio the island of Manhattan and of some of the faraway lands beyond
the Mississippi

So for generations they lived with their simple home customs and
their family affections with their games and sports their legends and
their songs their dances fasts and feasts their hunting and their
fishing their tribal feuds and wars They had but little religious
belief save that founded upon the superstition that lies at the
foundation of all uncivilized intelligence and though their customs
show a certain strain of cruelty in their nature this was not a savage
and vindictive cruelty but was rather the result of what was from
their way of looking at things an entirely justifiable understanding of
order and of law

At the time of our story certain of these Algonquin tribes of Virginia
were joined together in a sort of Indian republic composed of thirty
tribes scattered through Central and Eastern Virginia and known to
their neighbors as the Confederacy of the Powhatans This name
was taken from the tribe that was at once the strongest and the most
energetic one in this tribal union and that had its fields and villages
along the broad river known to the Indians as the Powhatan and to us
as the James

The principal chief of the Powhatans was Wabunsonacook called by
the white men Powhatan He was a strongly built but rather sternfaced
old gentleman of about sixty and possessed such an influence over his
tribesmen that he was regarded as the head man president we might
say of their forest republic which comprised the thirty confederated
tribes of Powhatan The confederacy in its strongest days never
numbered more than eight or nine thousand people and yet it was
considered one of the largest Indian unions in America This therefore
may be considered as pretty good proof that there was never after all
a very extensive Indian population in America even before the white man
discovered it

Into one of the Powhatan villages that stood very near the shores of
Chesapeake Bay and almost opposite the now historic site of Yorktown
came one biting day in the winter of 1607 an Indian runner whose name
was Rabunta He came as one that had important news to tell but he
paused not for shout or question from the inquisitive boys who were
tumbling about in the light snow in their favorite sport of Gawasa or
the snowsnake game One of the boys a mischievous and sturdy young
Indian of thirteen whose name was Nantaquaus even tried to insert
the slender knobheaded stick which was the snake in the game
between the runners legs and trip him up But Rabunta was too
skilful a runner to be stopped by trifles he simply kicked the snake
out of his way and hurried on to the long house of the chief

Now this Indian settlement into which the runner had come was the
Powhatan village of Werowocomoco and was the one in which the old
chief Wabunsonacook usually resided Here was the long councilhouse
in which the chieftains of the various tribes in the confederacy met for
counsel and for action and here too was the long tenementhouse in
which the old chief and his immediate family lived

It was into this dwelling that the runner dashed In a group about the
central firepit he saw the chief Even before he could himself stop his
headlong speed however his race with news came to an unexpected end
The five fires were all surrounded by lolling Indians for the weather
in that winter of 1607 was terribly cold and an Indian when inside his
house always likes to get as near to the fire as possible But down the
long passageway the children were noisily playing at their gamesat
guskaeh or peachpits at gusgaesata or deerbuttons and
some of the younger boys were turning wonderful somersaults up and down
the open spaces between the firepits Just as the runner Rabunta
sped up the passageway one of these youthful gymnasts with a dizzy
succession of handsprings came whizzing down the passageway right in
the path of Rabunta

There was a sudden collision The tumblers stout little feet came plump
against the breast of Rabunta and so sudden and unexpected was the
shock that both recoiled and runner and gymnast alike tumbled over in a
writhing heap upon the very edge of one of the big bonfires Then there
was a great shout of laughter for the Indians dearly loved a joke and
such a rough piece of unintentional pleasantry was especially relished

Wa wa Rabunta they shouted pointing at the discomfited runner as
he picked himself out of the fire knocked over by a girl

And the deep voice of the old chief said half sternly half tenderly

My daughter you have wellnigh killed our brother Rabunta with
your foolery That is scarce girls play Why will you be such a
pocahuntas1

1 Pocahuntas Algonquin for a little tomboy


The runner joined in the laugh against him quite as merrily as did the
rest and made a dash at the little tenyearold tumbler which she as
nimbly evaded Mamanotowic1 he said the feet of Mataoka
are even heavier than the snake of Nuntaquaus her brother I have but
escaped them both with my life Mamanotowic I have news for
you The braves with your brother Opechancanough have taken the
paleface chief in the Chickahominy swamps and are bringing him to the
councilhouse

1 Great man or strong one a title by which Wabunsonacook or
Powhatan was frequently addressed


Wa said the old chief it is well we will be ready for him

At once Rabunta was surrounded and plied with questions The earlier
American Indians were always a very inquisitive folk and were great
gossips Rabuntas news would furnish firepit talk for months so
they must know all the particulars What was this white caucorouse
captain or leader like What had he on Did he use his magic against
the braves Were any of them killed

For the fame of the white caucorouse the great captain as
the Indians called the courageous and intrepid little governor of the
Virginia colony Captain John Smith had already gone throughout the
confederacy and his capture was even better than a victory over their
deadliest enemies the Mannahoacks

Rabunta was as good a gossip and storyteller as any of his tribesmen
and as he squatted before the upper firepit and ate a hearty meal
of parched corn which the little Mataoka brought him as a
peaceoffering he gave the details of the celebrated capture The
great captain he said and two of his men had been surprised in
the Chickahominy swamps by the chief Opechancanough and two hundred
braves The two men were killed by the chief but the captain seeing
himself thus entrapped seized his Indian guide and fastened him before
as a shield and thus sent out so much of his magic thunder from his
firetube that he killed or wounded many of the Indians and yet kept
himself from harm though his clothes were torn with arrowshots At
last however said the runner the captain had slipped into a
mudhole in the swamps and being there surrounded was dragged out and
made captive and he Rabunta had been sent on to tell the great news
to the chief

The Indians especially admired bravery and cunning This device of
the white chieftain and his valor when attacked appealed to their
admiration and there was great desire to see him when next day he was
brought into the village by the chief of the Pamunkee or York River
Indians Opechancanough brother of the chief of the Powhatans

The renowned prisoner was received with the customary chorus of Indian
yells and then acting upon the one leading Indian custom the law of
unlimited hospitality a bountiful feast was set before the captive
who like the valiant man he was ate heartily though ignorant what his
fate might be

The Indians seldom wantonly killed their captives When a sufficient
number had been sacrificed to avenge the memory of such braves as had
fallen in fight the remaining captives were either adopted as tribesmen
or disposed of as slaves

So valiant a warrior as this palefaced caucorouse was too important
a personage to be used as a slave and Wabunsonacook the chief
received him as an honored guest1 rather than as a prisoner kept him
in his own house for two days and adopting him as his own son promised
him a large gift of land Then with many expressions of friendship he
returned him well escorted by Indian guides to the trail that led back
direct to the English colony at Jamestown

1 Hee kindly welcomed me with good wordes says Smiths own
narrative assuring me his friendship and my libertie

This rather destroys the longfamiliar romance of the doughty captains
life being saved by the kings own daughter but it seems to be the
only true version of the story based upon his own original report

But though the oftdescribed rescue did not take place the valiant
Englishmans attention was speedily drawn to the agile little Indian
girl Mataoka whom her father called his tomboy or pocahuntas

She was as inquisitive as any young girl savage or civilized and she
was so full of kindly attentions to the captain and bestowed on him so
many smiles and looks of wondering curiosity that Smith made much of
her in return gave her some trifling presents and asked her name

Now it was one of the many singular customs of the American Indians
never to tell their own names nor even to allow them to be spoken to
strangers by any of their own immediate kindred The reason for this lay
in the superstition which held that the speaking of ones real name gave
to the stranger to whom it was spoken a magical and harmful influence
over such person For the Indian religion was full of what is called the
supernatural

So when the old chief of the Powhatans who for this very reason
was known to the colonists by the name of his tribe Powhatan
rather than by his real name of Wabunsonacook was asked his little
daughters name he hesitated and then gave in reply the nickname by
which he often called her Pocahuntas the little tomboyfor this
agile young maiden by reason of her relationship to the head chief
was allowed much more freedom and fun than was usually the lot of Indian
girls who were as a rule the patient and uncomplaining little drudges
of every Indian home and village

So when Captain Smith left Werowocomoco he left one firm friend
behind himthe pretty little Indian girl Mataokawho long
remembered the white man and his presents and determined after her
own wilful fashion to go into the white mans village and see all their
wonders for herself

In less than a year she saw the captain again For when in the fall
of 1608 he came to her fathers village to invite the old chief to
Jamestown to be crowned by the English as king of the Powhatans
this bright little girl of twelve gathered together the other little
girls of the village and almost upon the very spot where many years
after Cornwallis was to surrender the armies of England to the rebel
republic she with her companions entertained the English captain with a
gay Indian dance full of noise and frolic

Soon after this second interview Mataokas wish to see the white
mans village was gratified For in that same autumn of 1608 she came
with Rabunta to Jamestown She sought out the captain who was then
president of the colony and entreated the libertie of certain of
her tribesmen who had been detainedin other words treacherously
made prisoners by the settlers because of some fear of an Indian plot
against them

Smith was a shrewd enough man to know when to bluster and when to be
friendly He released the Indian captives at Mataokas wishwell
knowing that the little girl had been duly coached by her wily old
father but feeling that even the friendship of a child may often be of
value to people in a strange land

The result of this visit to Jamestown was the frequent presence in the
town of the chieftains daughter She would come sometimes with
her brother Nantaquaus sometimes with the runner Rabunta and
sometimes with certain of her girl followers For even little Indian
girls had their dearest friends quite as much as have our own
clannish young schoolgirls of today

I am afraid however that this twelveyearold Mataoka fully
deserved even when she should have been on her good behavior among the
white people the nickname of little tomboy pocahuntas that
her father had given herfor we have the assurance of sedate Master
William Strachey secretary of the colony that the before remembered
Pocahontas Powhatans daughter sometimes resorting to our fort of
the age then of eleven or twelve years did get the boyes forth with
her into the marketplace and make them wheele falling on their hand
turning their heeles upward whome she would followe and wheele so
herself all the fort over From which it would appear that she could
easily stunt the English boys at making cartwheels

But there came a time very soon when she came into Jamestown for other
purpose than turning somersaults

The Indians soon learned to distrust the white men because of the
unfriendly and selfish dealings of the newcomers their tyranny their
haughty disregard of the Indians wishes and desires and their impudent
meddling alike with chieftains and with tribesmen Discontent grew
into hatred and led on by certain traitors in the colony a plot was
arranged for the murder of Captain Smith and the destruction of the
colony

Three times they attempted to entrap and destroy the great captain and
his people but each time the little Mataoka full of friendship and
pity for her new acquaintances stole cautiously into the town or found
some means of misleading the conspirators and thus warned her white
friends of their danger

One dark winter night in January 1609 Captain Smith who had came to
Werowocomoco for conference and treaty with Wabunsonacook whom
he always called Powhatan sat in the York River woods awaiting some
provisions that the chief had promised himfor eatables were scarce
that winter in the Virginia colony

There was a light step beneath which the dry twiggs on the ground
crackled slightly and the wary captain grasped his matchlock and bade
his men be on their guard Again the twigs crackled and now there came
from the shadow of the woods not a train of Indians but one little
girlMataoka or Pocahontas

Be guarded my father she said as Smith drew her to his side The
corn and the good cheer will come as promised but even now my father
the chief of the Powhatans is gathering all his power to fall upon you
and kill you If you would live get you away at once

The captain prepared to act upon her advice without delay but he felt
so grateful at this latest and most hazardous proof of the little
Indian girls regard that he desired to manifest his thankfulness by
presentsthe surest way to reach an Indians heart

My daughter he said kindly you have again saved my life coming
alone and at risk of your own young life through the irksome woods and
in this gloomy night to admonish me Take this I pray you from me and
let it always tell you of the love of Captain Smith

And the grateful pioneer handed her his muchprized pocket compassan
instrument regarded with awe by the Indians and esteemed as one of the
instruments of the white mans magic

But Mataoka although she longed to possess this wonderful
pathteller shook her head

Not so Caucorouse she said if it should be seen by my tribesmen
or even by my father the chief I should but be as dead to them for
they would know that I have warned you whom they have sworn to kill and
so would they kill me also Stay not to parley my father but be gone
at once

And with that says the record she ran away by herself as she came

So the captain hurried back to Jamestown and Mataoka returned to her
people

Soon after Smith left the colony sick and worn out by the continual
worries and disputes with his fellowcolonists and Mataoka felt that
in the absence of her best friend and the increasing troubles between
her tribesmen and the palefaces it would be unwise for her to visit
Jamestown

Her fears seem to have been well grounded for in the spring of
1613 Mataoka being then about sixteen was treacherously and by
stratagem kidnapped by the bold and unscrupulous Captain Argallhalf
pirate half traderand was held by the colonists as hostage for the
friendship of Powhatan

Within these three years however she had been married to the chief of
one of the tributary tribes Kokoum by name but as was the Indian
marriage custom Kokoum had come to live among the kindred of his
wife and had shortly after been killed in one of the numerous Indian
fights

It was during the captivity of the young widow at Jamestown that
she became acquainted with Master John Rolfe an industrious young
Englishman and the man who first of all the American colonists
attempted the cultivation of tobacco

Master Rolfe was a widower and an ardent desirer of the conversion of
the pagan salvages He became interested in the young Indian widow and
though he protests that he married her for the purpose of converting
her to Christianity and rather ungallantly calls her an unbelieving
creature it is just possible that if she had not been a pretty
and altogether captivating young unbeliever he would have found less
personal means for her conversion

Well the Englishman and the Indian girl as we all know were married
lived happily together and finally departed for England Here all too
soon in 1617 when she was about twentyone the daughter of the great
chieftain of the Powhatans died

Her story is both a pleasant and a sad one It needs none of the
additional romance that has been thrown about it to render it more
interesting An Indian girl free as her native forests made friends
with the race that all unnecessarily became hostile to her own
Brighter perhaps than most of the girls of her tribe she recognized
and desired to avail herself of the refinements of civilization and so
gave up her barbaric surroundings cast in her lot with the white race
and sought to make peace and friendship between neighbors take the place
of quarrel and of war

The white race has nothing to be proud of in its conquest of the
people who once owned and occupied the vast area of the North American
continent The story is neither an agreeable nor a chivalrous one
But out of the gloom which surrounds it there come some figures that
relieve the darkness the treachery and the crime that make it so sad
And not the least impressive of these is this bright and gentle little
daughter of Wabunsonacook chief of the Powhatans Mataoka
friend of the white strangers whom we of this later day know by the
nickname her loving old father gave herPocahuntas the Algonquin
