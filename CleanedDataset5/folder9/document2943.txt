THE GREAT HUNGER




Book I



Chapter I


For sheer havoc there is no gale like a good northwester when it roars
in through the long winter evenings driving the spindrift before it
between the rocky walls of the fjord It churns the water to a froth
of rushing wave crests while the boats along the beach are flung in
somersaults up to the doors of the grey fisher huts and solid old barn
gangways are lifted and sent flying like unwieldy birds over the fields
Mercy on us cry the maids for it is milkingtime and they have
to fight their way on hands and knees across the yard to the cowshed
dragging a lantern that WILL go out and a milkpail that WONT be held
And Lord preserve us mutter the old wives seated round the stove
within doorsand their thoughts are far away in the north with the
Lofoten fishermen out at sea maybe this very night

But on a calm spring day the fjord just steals in smooth and shining
by ness and bay And at low water there is a whole wonderland of strange
little islands sandbanks and weedfringed rocks left high and dry
with clear pools between where barelegged urchins splash about and
tiny flatfish as big as a halfpenny dart away to every side The air is
filled with a smell of salt seawater and warm wet beachwaste and
the seapie seesawing about on a big stone in the water lifts his red
beak cheerily sunwards and pipes Kluip kluip the spring has come

On just such a day two boys of fourteen or thereabouts came hurrying
out from one of the fishermens huts down towards the beach Boys
are never so busy as when they are up to some piece of mischief and
evidently the pair had business of this sort in hand Peer Troen
fairhaired and sallowfaced was pushing a wheelbarrow his companion
Martin Bruvold a dark youth with freckles carried a tub And both
talked mysteriously in whispers casting anxious glances out over the
water

Peer Troen was of course the ringleader That he always was the
forest fire of last year was laid at his door And now he had made it
clear to some of his friends that boys had just as much right to lay
out deepsea lines as men All through the winter they had been kept at
grownup work cutting peat and carrying wood why should they be left
now to fool about with the inshore fishing and bring home nothing
better than flounders and coalfish and silly codlings The big deepsea
line they were forbidden to touchthat was sobut the Lofoten fishery
was at its height and none of the men would be back till it was over
So the boys had baited up the line on the sly down at the boathouse the
day before and laid it out across the deepest part of the fjord

Now the thing about a deepsea line is that it may bring to the surface
fish so big and so fearsome that the like has never been seen before
Yesterday however there had been trouble of a different sort To their
dismay the boys had found that they had not sinkers enough to weight
the shore end of the line and it looked as if they might have to give
up the whole thing But Peer ever ready had hit on the novel idea of
making one end fast to the trunk of a small fir growing at the outermost
point of the ness and carrying the line from there out over the open
fjord Then a stone at the farther end and with the magic words Fie
fish it was paid out overboard vanishing into the green depths The
deed was done True there were a couple of hooks dangling in midair
at the shore end between the tree and the water and while they might
serve to catch an eider duck or a guillemot if any one should chance
to come rowing past in the dark and get hung upwhy the boys might
find they had made a human catch No wonder then that they whispered
eagerly and hurried down to the boat

Here comes Peter Ronningen cried Martin suddenly

This was the third member of the crew a lanky youth with whitish
eyebrows and a foolish face He stammered and made a queer noise
when he laughed Cheeheehee Twice he had been turned down in the
confirmation classes after all what was the use of learning lessons
out of a book when nobody ever had patience to wait while he said them

Together they ran the boat down to the waters edge got it afloat and
scrambled in with much waving of patched trouser legs Hi cried a
voice up on the beach let me come too

Theres Klaus said Martin Shall we take him along

No said Peter Ronningen

Oh yes lets said Peer

Klaus Brock the son of the district doctor was a blueeyed youngster
in knickerbockers and a sailor blouse He was playing truant no
doubtKlaus had his lessons at home with a private tutorand would
certainly get a thrashing from his father when he got home

Hurry up called Peer getting out an oar Klaus clambered in and the
whitestraked fouroar surged across the bay rocking a little as the
boys pulled out of stroke Martin was rowing at the bow his eyes fixed
on Peer who sat in the stern in command with his eyes dancing full of
great things to be done Martin poor fellow was half afraid already
he never could understand why Peer who was to be a parson when he grew
up was always hitting upon things to do that were evidently sinful in
the sight of the Lord

Peer was a town boy who had been put out to board with a fisherman in
the village His mother had been no better than she should be so people
said but she was dead now and the father at any rate must be a rich
gentleman for he sent the boy a present of ten whole crowns every
Christmas so that Peer always had money in his pocket Naturally then
he was looked up to by the other boys and took the lead in all things
as a chieftain by right

The boat moved on past the grey rocks the beach and the huts above it
growing blue and faint in the distance Up among the distant hills a red
wooden farmhouse on its white foundation wall stood out clear

Here was the ness at last and there stood the fir Peer climbed up
and loosed the end of the line while the others leaned over the side
watching the cord where it vanished in the depths What would it bring
to light when it came up

Row ordered Peer and began hauling in

The boat was headed straight out across the fjord and the long line
with its trailing hooks hauled in and coiled up neatly in the bottom
of a shallow tub Peers heart was beating There came a tugthe
firstand the faint shimmer of a fish deep down in the water Pooh
only a big cod Peer heaved it in with a careless swing over the
gunwale Next came a linga deep water fish at any rate this time Then
a tusk and another and another these would please the women being
good eating and perhaps make them hold their tongues when the men came
home Now the line jerks heavily what is coming A grey shadow comes in
sight Here with the gaff cries Peer and Peter throws it across to
him What is it what is it shriek the other three Steady dont
upset the boat a catfish A stroke of the gaff over the side and a
clumsy grey body is heaved into the boat where it rolls about hissing
and biting at the bottomboards and baler the splinters crackling under
its teeth Mind mind cries Klaushe was always nervous in a boat

But Peer was hauling in again They were nearly halfway across the
fjord by now and the line came up from mysterious depths which no
fisherman had ever sounded The strain on Peer began to show in his
looks the others sat watching his face Is the line heavy asked
Klaus Keep still cant you put in Martin glancing along the
slanting line to where it vanished far below Peer was still hauling A
sense of something uncanny seemed to be thrilling up into his hands
from the deep sea The feel of the line was strange There was no great
weight not even the clean tugtug of an ordinary fish it was as if a
giant hand were pulling gently very gently to draw him overboard and
down into the depths Then suddenly a violent jerk almost dragged him
over the side

Look out What is it cried the three together

Sit down in the boat shouted Peer And with the true fishermans
sense of discipline they obeyed

Peer was gripping the line firmly with one hand the other clutching one
of the thwarts Have we another gaff he jerked out breathlessly

Heres one Peter Ronningen pulled out a second ironhooked cudgel

You take it Martin and stand by

But whatwhat is it

Dont know what it is But its something big

Cut the line and row for your lives wailed the doctors son Strange
he should be such a coward at sea a fellow whod tackle a man twice his
size on dry land

Once more Peer was jerked almost overboard He thought of the forest
fire the year beforeit would never do to have another such mishap
on his shoulders Suppose the great monster did come up and capsize
themthey were ever so far from land What a to do there would be
if they were all drowned and it came out that it was his fault
Involuntarily he felt for his knife to cut the linethen thrust it back
again and went on hauling

Here it comesa great shadow heaving up through the water The huge
beast flings itself round sending a flurry of bubbles to the surface
And therea gleam of white a row of great white teeth on the
underside Aha now he knows what it is The Greenland shark is the
fiercest monster of the northern seas quite able to make short work of
a few boys or so

Steady now Martinready with the gaff

The brute was wallowing on the surface now the water boiling around
him His tail lashed the sea to foam a big pointed head showed up
squirming under the hook Now cried Peer and two gaffs struck at
the same moment the boat heeled over letting in a rush of water and
Klaus dropping his oars sprang into the bow with a cry of Jesus
save us

Next second a heavy body big as a grown man was heaved in over the
gunwale and two boys were all but shot out the other way And now the
fun began The boys loosed their hold of the gaffs and sprang apart to
give the creature room There it lay raging the great black beast of
prey with its sharp threatening snout and wicked red eyes ablaze The
strong tail lashed out hurling oars and balers overboard the long
teeth snapped at the bottomboards and thwarts Now and again it would
leap high up in the air only to fall back again writhing furiously
hissing and spitting and frothing at the mouth its red eyes glaring
from one to another of the terrified captors as if saying Come
onjust a little nearer

Meanwhile Martin Bruvold was in terror that the shark would smash the
boat to pieces He drew his knife and took a step forwarda flash in
the air and the steel went in deep between the back fins sending up
a spurt of blood Look out cried the others but Martin had already
sprung back out of reach of the black tail And now the dance of death
began anew The knife was fixed to the grip in the creatures back
one gaff had buried its hook between the eyes and another hung on the
flankthe wooden shafts were flung this way and that at every bound
and the boats frame shook and groaned under the blows

Shell smash the boat and well go to the bottom cried Peer

And now HIS knife flashed out and sent a stream of blood spouting from
between the shoulders but the blow cost him his footholdand in a
moment the two bodies were rolling over and over together in the bottom
of the boat

Oh Lord Jesus shrieked Klaus clinging to the stempost Shell kill
him Shell kill him

Peer was half up now on his knees but as he reached out a hand to
grasp the side the brutes jaws seized on his arm The boys face
was contorted with painanother moment and the sharp teeth would have
bitten through when swift as thought Peter Ronningen dropped his
oars and sent his knife straight in between the beasts eyes The blade
pierced through to the brain and the grip of the teeth relaxed

Cccursed dddevil stammered Peter as he scrambled back to
his oars Another moment and Peer had dragged himself clear and was
kneeling by the forward thwart holding the ragged sleeve of his wounded
arm while the blood trickled through his fingers

When at last they were pulling homeward the little boat overloaded with
the weight of the great carcase all at once they stopped rowing

Where is Klaus asked Peerfor the doctors son was gone from where
he had sat clinging to the stem

Whythere he isin the bottom

There lay the big lout of fifteen who already boasted of his
loveaffairs learned German and was to be a gentleman like his
fatherthere he lay on the bottomboards in the bow in a dead faint

The others were frightened at first but Peer who was sitting washing
his wounded arm took a dipper full of water and flung it in the
unconscious ones face The next instant Klaus had started up sitting
caught wildly at the gunwale and shrieked out

Cut the line and row for your lives

A roar of laughter went up from the rest they dropped their oars and
sat doubled up and gasping But on the beach before going home
they agreed to say nothing about Klauss fainting fit And for weeks
afterwards the four scamps exploit was the talk of the village so that
they felt there was not much fear of their getting the thrashing they
deserved when the men came home



Chapter II


When Peer as quite a little fellow had been sent to live with the old
couple at Troen he had already passed several times from one adopted
home to another though this he did not remember He was one of the
madcaps of the village now but it was not long since he had been a
solitary child moping apart from the rest Why did people always say
Poor child whenever they were speaking about his real mother Why did
they do it Why even Peter Ronningen when he was angry would stammer
out You bababastard But Peer called the pockmarked goodwife at
Troen mother and her bandylegged husband father and lent the old
man a hand wherever he was wantedin the smithy or in the boats at the
fishing

His childhood was passed among folk who counted it sinful to smile and
whose minds were gloomy as the grey seafog with poverty psalmsinging
and the fear of hell

One day coming home from his work at the peat bog he found the elders
snuffling and sighing over their afternoon meal Peer wiped the sweat
from his forehead and asked what was the matter

The eldest son shoved a spoonful of porridge into his mouth wiped his
eyes swallowed and said Poor Peer

Aye poor little chap sighed the old man thrusting his horn spoon
into a crack in the wall that served as a rack

Neither father nor mother now whimpered the eldest daughter looking
over to the window

Mother Is she

Ay dearie yes sighed the old woman Shes gone for suregone to
meet her Judge

Later as the day went on Peer tried to cry too The worst thing of all
was that every one in the house seemed so perfectly certain where his
mother had gone to And to heaven it certainly was not But how could
they be so sure about it

Peer had seen her only once one summers day when she had come out
to see the place She wore a light dress and a big straw hat and he
thought he had never seen anything so beautiful before She made no
secret of it among the neighbours that Peer was not her only child
there was a little girl too named Louise who was with some folks
away up in the inland parishes She was in high spirits and told risky
stories and sang songs by no means sacred The old people shook their
heads over herthe younger ones watched her with sidelong glances And
when she left she kissed Peer and turned round more than once to look
back at him flushed under her big hat and smiling and it seemed to
Peer that she must surely be the loveliest creature in all the world

But nownow she had gone to a place where the ungodly dwell in
such frightful torment and no hope of salvation for her through all
eternityand Peer all the while could only think of her in a light
dress and a big straw hat all song and happy laughter

Then came the question Who was to pay for the boy now True his
baptismal certificate said that he had a fatherhis name was Holm
and he lived in Christianiabut from what the mother had said it was
understood that he had disappeared long ago What was to be done with
the boy

Never till now had Peer rightly understood that he was a stranger here
for all that he called the old couple father and mother

He lay awake night after night up in the loft listening to the talk
about him going on in the room belowthe goodwife crying and saying
No no the others saying how hard the times were and that Peer
was quite old enough now to be put to service as a goatherd on some
upcountry farm

Then Peer would draw the skinrug up over his head But often when one
of the elders chanced to be awake at night he could hear some one in
the loft sobbing in his sleep In the daytime he took up as little room
as he could at the table and ate as little as humanly possible but
every morning he woke up in fear that todaytoday he would have to
bid the old fostermother farewell and go out among strangers

Then something new and unheard of plumped down into the little cottage
by the fjord

There came a registered letter with great dabs of sealingwax all over
it and a handwriting so gentlemanly as to be almost unreadable Every
one crowded round the eldest son to see it openedand out fell five
tencrown notes Mercy on us they cried in amazement and Can it
be for us The next thing was to puzzle out what was written in the
letter And who should that turn out to be from butno other than
Peers father though he did not say it in so many words Be good to
the boy the letter said You will receive fifty crowns from me every
halfyear See that he gets plenty to eat and goes dry and well shod
Faithfully your P Holm Captain

Why PeerheshesYour fathers a captain an officer stammered
the eldest girl and fell back a step to stare at the boy

And were to get twice as much for him as before said the son
holding the notes fast and gazing up at the ceiling as if he were
informing Heaven of the fact

But the old wife was thinking of something else as she folded her hands
in thankfulnessnow she neednt lose the boy

Properly fed No need to fear for that Peer had treacle with his
porridge that very day though it was only a weekday And the eldest
son gave him a pair of stockings and made him sit down and put them on
then and there and the same night when he went to bed the eldest girl
came and tucked him up in a new skinrug not quite so hairless as the
old one His father a captain It seemed too wonderful to be true

From that day times were changed for Peer People looked at him with
very different eyes No one said Poor boy of him now The other boys
left off calling him bad names the grownups said he had a future
before him Youll see they would say that father of yours will get
you on youll be a parson yet ay maybe a bishop too At Christmas
there came a tencrown note all for himself to do just as he liked
with Peer changed it into silver so that his purse was near bursting
with prosperity No wonder he began to go about with his nose in the
air and play the little prince and chieftain among the boys Even Klaus
Brock the doctors son made up to him and taught him to play cards
ButYou surely dont mean to go and be a parson he would say

For all this no one could say that Peer was too proud to help with the
fishing or make himself useful in the smithy But when the sparks flew
showering from the glowing iron he could not help seeing visions of his
ownvisions that flew out into the future Aye he WOULD be a priest
He might be a sinner now and a wild young scamp he certainly did curse
and swear like a trooper at times if only to show the other boys that
it was all nonsense about the earth opening and swallowing you up But
a priest he would be all the same None of your parsons with spectacles
and a pot belly no but a sort of heavenly messenger with snowy white
robes and a face of glory Perhaps some day he might even come so far
that he could go down into that place of torment where his mother lay
and bring her up again up to salvation And when in autumn evenings
he stood outside his palace a whitehaired bishop he would lift up his
finger and all the stars should break into song

Clang clang sang the anvil under the hammers beat

In the still summer evenings a troop of boys go climbing up the naked
slopes towards the high wooded ranges to fetch home the cows for the
milking The higher they climb the farther and farther their sight can
travel out over the sea And an hour or two later as the sun goes down
here comes a long string of redflanked cattle trailing down with a
faint jangle of bells over the faroff ridges The boys halloo them
onOhooooooand swing their ringed rowan staves and spit red
juice of the alder bark that they are chewing as men chew tobacco Far
below them they see the farm lands grey in shadow and beyond the
waters of the fjord yellow in the evening light a mirror where red
clouds and white sails and hills of liquid blue are shining And away
out on the farthest headland the lonely star of the coast light over
the grey sea

On such an evening Peer came down from the hills just in time to see a
gentleman in a carriole turn off from the highway and take the byroad
down towards Troen The horse balked suddenly at a small bridge and
when the driver reined him in and gave him a cut with his whip the
beast reared swung about and sent the cart fairly dancing round on its
high wheels Oh well then Ill have to walk cried the gentleman
angrily and flinging the reins to the lad behind him he jumped down
Just at this moment Peer came up

Here boy began the traveller just take this bag will you And
He broke off suddenly took a step backward and looked hard at the boy
Whatsurely it cant beIs it you Peer

Yees said Peer gaping a little and took off his cap

Well now thats funny My name is Holm Well wellwell well

The lad in the cart had driven off and the gentleman from the city and
the pale country boy with the patched trousers stood looking at each
other

The newcomer was a man of fifty or so but still straight and active
though his hair and closetrimmed beard were sprinkled with grey His
eyes twinkled gaily under the brim of his black felt hat his long
overcoat was open showing a gold chain across his waistcoat With a
pair of gloves and an umbrella in one hand a light travelling bag
in the other and his beautifully polished shoesa grand gentleman
thought Peer if ever there was one And this was his father

So thats how you look my boy Not very big for your agenearly
sixteen now arent you Do they give you enough to eat

Yes said Peer with conviction

The pair walked down together towards the grey cottage by the fjord
Suddenly the man stopped and looked at it through halfshut eyes

Is that where youve been living all these years

Yes

In that little hut there

Yes Thats the placeTroen they call it

Why that wall there bulges so I should think the whole affair would
collapse soon

Peer tried to laugh at this but felt something like a lump in his
throat It hurt to hear fine folks talk like that of father and mothers
little house

There was a great flurry when the strange gentleman appeared in the
doorway The old wife was kneading away at the dough for a cake the
front of her all white with flour the old man sat with his spectacles
on patching a shoe and the two girls sprang up from their spinning
wheels Well here I am My names Holm said the traveller looking
round and smiling Mercy on us the Captain his own self murmured the
old woman wiping her hands on her skirt

He was an affable gentleman and soon set them all at their ease He sat
down in the seat of honour drumming with his fingers on the table and
talking easily as if quite at home One of the girls had been in service
for a while in a Consuls family in the town and knew the ways of
gentlefolk and she fetched a bowl of milk and offered it with a curtsy
and a Will the Captain please to take some milk Thanks thanks
said the visitor And what is your name my dear Come theres nothing
to blush about Nicoline Firstrate And you Lusiana Thats right
He looked at the redrimmed basin and taking it up all but emptied it
at a draught then wiping his beard took breath Phuthat was good
Well so here I am And he looked around the room and at each of them
in turn and smiled and drummed with his fingers and said Well
wellwell well and seemed much amused with everything in general
By the way Nicoline he said suddenly since youre so well up in
titles Im not Captain any more now theyve sent me up this way as
LieutenantColonel and my wife has just had a house left her in your
town here so we may be coming to settle down in these parts And
perhaps youd better send letters to me through a friend in future But
we can talk about all that by and by Well wellwell well And all
the time he was drumming with his fingers on the table and smiling Peer
noticed that he wore gold sleevelinks and a fine gold stud in his broad
white shirtfront

And then a little packet was produced Hi Peer come and look heres
something for you And the something was nothing less than a real
silver watchand Peer was quite unhappy for the moment because he
couldnt dash off at once and show it to all the other boys Theres
a father for you said the old wife clapping her hands and almost
in tears But the visitor patted her on the shoulder Father father
Hmthats not a thing any one can be so sure about Hahaha And
hahaha echoed the old man still sitting with the awl in his hand
This was the sort of joke he could appreciate

Then the visitor went out and strolled about the place with his
hands under his coat tails and looked at the sky and the fjord and
murmured Well wellwell well and Peer followed him about all
the while and gazed at him as he might have gazed at a star He was to
sleep in a neighbours house where there was a room that had a bed with
sheets on it and Peer went across with him and carried his bag It was
Martin Bruvolds parents who were to house the traveller and people
stood round staring at the place Martin himself was waiting outside
This a friend of yours Peer Here then my boy heres something to
buy a big farm with This time it was a fivecrown note and Martin
stood fingering it hardly able to believe his eyes Peers father was
something like a father

It was a fine thing too to see a grand gentleman undress Ill have
things like that some day thought Peer watching each new wonder that
came out of the bag There was a silverbacked brush that he brushed
his hair and beard with walking up and down in his underclothes and
humming to himself And then there was another shirt with red stripes
round the collar just to wear in bed Peer nodded to himself taking
it all in And when the stranger was in bed he took out a flask with a
silver cork that screwed off and turned into a cup and had a dram for
a nightcap and then he reached for a long pipe with a beaded cord and
when it was drawing well he stretched himself out comfortably and smiled
at Peer

Well now my boyare you getting on well at school

Peer put his hands behind him and set one foot forward Yeshe says
soteacher does

How much is twelve times twelve

That was a stumper Peer hadnt got beyond ten times ten

Do they teach you gymnastics at the school

Gym Whats that

Jumping and vaulting and climbing ropes and drilling in squadswhat

But isnt itisnt that wicked

Wicked Hahaha Wicked did you say So thats the way they look
at things here is it Well wellwell well Hahaha Hand me that
matchbox my boy Hm He puffed away for a while in silence Then
suddenly

See here boy Did you know youd a little sister

Yes I know

Halfsister that is to say I didnt quite know how it was myself But
I may as well tell you my boy that I paid the same for you all along
the same as now Only I sent the money by your mother and shewell
she poor girl had another one to look after and no father to pay for
it So she made my money do for both Hahaha Well poor girl we
cant blame her for that Anyhow well have to look after that little
halfsister of yours now I suppose till she grows up Dont you think
so yourself

Peer felt the tears coming Think soindeed he did

Next day Peers father went away He stood there ready to start in the
livingroom at Troen stiff felt hat and overcoat and all and said
in a tone like the sheriffs when he gives out a public notice at the
church door

And by the way youre to have the boy confirmed this year

Yes to be sure we will the old mother hastened to say

Then I wish him to be properly dressed like the best of the other
youngsters And theres fifty crowns for him to give the schoolteacher
and the parson as a parting gift He handed over some more notes

Afterwards he went on I mean of course to look after him until
he can make his own way in a respectable position But first we must see
what he has a turn for and what hed like to be himself Hed better
come to town and talk it over with mebut Ill write and arrange all
that after hes confirmed Then in case anything unexpected should
happen to me theres some money laid by for him in a savings bank
account he can apply to a friend of mine who knows all about it Well
goodbye and very many thanks

And the great man smiled to right and left and shook them all by the
hand and waved his hat and was gone

For the next few days Peer walked on air and found it hard to keep his
footing at all on the common earth People were for ever filling his
head with talk about that savings bank accountit might be only a few
thousands of crownsbut then again it might run up to a million A
million and here he was eating herrings for dinner and talking to
Tom Dick and Harry just like any one else A million crowns

Late in the autumn came the confirmation and the old wooden church
with its tarred walls nestled among its mighty treetops sent its
chimes ringing and ringing out into the blue autumn air It seemed
to Peer like some kindly old grandmother calling so lovingly Come
comeold and youngold and youngfrom fjord and valleynorthways and
southways come comethis day of all daysthis day of all dayscome
come come So it had stood ringing out the chimes for one generation
after another through hundreds of years and now it is calling to us
And the young folks are there looking at one another in their new
clothes and blowing their noses on clean white handkerchiefs so
carefully folded There comes Peter Ronningen passed by good luck this
year but forced to turn out in a jacket borrowed from Peer as
the tailor wasnt ready with his own new things The boys say
howdoyoudo and try to smile like grownup folks One or two of them
may have some little account dating from old schoolfights waiting to
be settledbut never mindjust as well to forget old scores now Peer
caught sight of Johan Koja who stole a pencil from him last summer
but after all even that didnt seem worth making a fuss about Well
howve you been getting on since last summer they ask each other as
they move together up the stone steps to the big church door through
which the peal of the organ comes rolling out to meet them

How good it seems and how kind the little church where all you see
bids you welcome Through the stainedglass windows with their tiny
leaded panes falls a light so soft that even poor ugly faces seem
beautiful The organ tones are the very light itself turned into sweet
sound On one side of the nave you can see all the boys heads sleek
with water on the other the little mothers to be in grownup dress
today for the first time kerchief on head and hymnbook in hand and
with careful faces And now they all sing The elder folks have taken
their places farther back today but they join in looking up now and
again from the book to those young heads in front and wondering how
they will fare in life And the young folk themselves are thinking as
they sing Today is the beginning of new things Play and frolic are
over and done with from today were grownup But the church and all
in it seemed to say If ever you are in heavy trouble come hither to
me Just look at that altarpiece therethe woodcarvings are a whole
Bible in themselvesbut Moses with the Tables of the Law is gentle of
face today you can see he means no harm after all St Peter with the
keys pointing upwards looks like a kind old uncle bringing something
good home from market And then the angels on the walls pictured or
carved in wood have borrowed the voice of the organ and the tones of
the hymn and they widen out the vaulted roof into the dome of heaven
while light and song and worshippers melt together and soar upwards
toward the infinite spaces

Peer was thinking all the time I dont care if Im rich as rich I WILL
be a priest And then perhaps with all my money I can build a church
that no one ever saw the like of And the first couple Ill marry there
shall be Martin Bruvold and little sister Louiseif only hell have
her Just wait and see

A few days later he wrote to his father asking if he might come into
town now and go to school A long time passed and then at last a letter
came in a strange handwriting and all the grown folks at Troen came
together again to read it But what was their amazement when they read

You will possibly have learned by now from the newspapers that your
benefactor Colonel Holm has met his death by a fall from a horse I
must therefore request you to call on me personally at your earliest
convenience as I have several matters to settle with you Yours
faithfully J Grundt Senior Master

They stood and looked at one another

Peer was cryingchiefly it must be admitted at the thought of having
to bid goodbye to all the Troen folks and the two cows and the calf
and the grey cat He might have to go right on to Christiania no later
than tomorrowto go to school there and when he came backwhy very
likely the old mother might not be there any more

So all three of them were heavyhearted when the pockmarked goodwife
and the bowlegged old man came down with him to the pier And soon he
was standing on the deck of the fjord steamer gazing at the two figures
growing smaller and smaller on the shore And then one hut after another
in the little hamlet disappeared behind the nessTroen itself was
gone nowand the hills and the woods where he had cut ring staves
and searched for stray cattleswiftly all known things drew away and
vanished until at last the whole parish was gone and his childhood
over



Chapter III


As evening fell he saw a multitude of lights spread out on every side
far ahead in the darkness And next with his little wooden chest on his
shoulder he was finding his way up through the streets by the quay to
a lodginghouse for country folk which he knew from former visits when
he had come to the town with the Lofoten boats

Next morning clad in his country homespun he marched up along River
Street over the bridge and up the hill to the villa quarter where he
had to ask the way At last he arrived outside a whitepainted wooden
house standing back in a garden Here was the placethe place where his
fate was to be decided After the country fashion he walked in at the
kitchen door

A stout servant maid in a big white apron was rattling the rings of the
kitchen range into place there was a pleasing smell of coffee and good
things to eat Suddenly a door opened and a figure in a dressinggown
appeareda tall redhaired man with gold spectacles astride on a long
red nose his thick hair and scrubby little moustaches touched
with grey He gasped once or twice and then started
sneezinghochocputputschwiped his nose with a large
pockethandkerchief and grumbled out Ughthis wretched coldcant
get rid of it How about my socks Bertha my good girl do you think
they are quite dry now

Ive had them hung up ever since I lit the fire this morning said the
girl tossing her head

But who is this young gentleman may I ask The gold spectacles were
turned full on Peer who rose and bowed

Said he wanted to speak to you sir put in the maid

Ah From the country I see Have you anything to sell my lad

No said Peer He had had a letter   

The red head seemed positively frightened at thisand the dressinggown
faltered backwards as if to find support He cast a hurried glance at
the girl and then beckoned with a long forefinger to Peer Yes yes
perfectly so Be so good as to come this way my lad

Peer found himself in a room with rows of books all round the walls and
a big writingtable in the centre Sit down my boy The schoolmaster
went and picked out a long pipe and filled it clearing his throat
nervously with an occasional glance at the boy Hmso this is you
This is Peerhm He lit his pipe and puffed a little found himself
again obliged to sneezebut at last settled down in a chair at the
writingtable stretched out his long legs and puffed away again

So thats what you look like With a quick movement he reached for a
photograph in a frame Peer caught a glimpse of his father in uniform
The schoolmaster lifted his spectacles stared at the picture then let
down his spectacles again and fell to scrutinising Peers face There
was a silence for a while and then he said Ah indeedI seehm
Then turning to Peer

Well my lad it was very suddenyour benefactors endmost
unexpected He is to be buried today

Benefactor thought Peer Why doesnt he say your father

The schoolmaster was gazing at the window He informed me some time ago
ofhmof all theall the benefits he had conferred on youhm And
he begged me to keep an eye on you myself in case anything happened to
him And nowthe spectacles swung round towards Peernow you are
starting out in life by yourself hey

Yes said Peer shifting a little in his seat

You will have to decide now what walk in life you are toerdevote
yourself to

Yes said Peer again sitting up straighter

You would perhaps like to be a fishermanlike the good people youve
been brought up among

No Peer shook his head disdainfully Was this man trying to make a
fool of him

Some trade then perhaps

No

Oh then I suppose its to be America Well you will easily find
company to go with Such numbers are going nowadaysI am sorry to say
  

Peer pulled himself together Oh no not that at all Better get it
out at once I wish to be a priest he said speaking with a careful
town accent

The schoolmaster rose from his seat holding his long pipe up in the air
in one hand and pressing his ear forward with the other as though to
hear better Whatwhat did you say

A priest repeated Peer but he moved behind his chair as he spoke
for it looked as if the schoolmaster might fling the pipe at his head

But suddenly the red face broke into a smile exposing such an array of
greenish teeth as Peer had never seen before Then he said in a sort of
singsong nodding A priest Oh indeed Quite a small matter He rose
and wandered once or twice up and down the room then stopped
nodded and said in a fatherly toneto one of the bookshelves
Hmreallyreallywere a little ambitious are we not

He turned on Peer suddenly Look here my young frienddont you think
your benefactor has been quite generous enough to you already

Yes indeed he has said Peer his voice beginning to tremble a
little

There are thousands of boys in your position who are thrown out in the
world after confirmation and left to shift for themselves without a
soul to lend them a helping hand

Yes gasped Peer looking round involuntarily towards the door

I cant understandwho can have put these wild ideas into your head

With an effort Peer managed to get out Its always been what I wanted
And hefather

Who Father Do you mean your benefactor

Well he was my father wasnt he burst out Peer

The schoolmaster tottered back and sank into a chair staring at Peer as
if he thought him a quite hopeless subject At last he recovered so far
as to say Look here my lad dont you think you might be content to
call himnow and for the futurejust your benefactor Dont you think
he deserves it

Oh yes whispered Peer almost in tears

You are thinking of courseyou and those who have put all this
nonsense into your headof the money which hehm

Yesisnt there a savings bank account

Aha There we are Yes indeed There is a savings bank accountin my
care He rose and hunted out from a drawer a small greencovered book
Peer could not take his eyes from it Here it is The sum entered here
to your account amounts to eighteen hundred crowns

Crash Peer felt as if he had fallen through the floor into the
cellarage All his dreams vanished into thin airthe million
crownspriest and bishopChristianiaand all the rest

On the day when you are in a fair way to set up independently as an
artisan a farmer or a fishermanand when you seem to me to the best
of my judgment to deserve such helpthen and not till then I place
this book at your disposal Do you understand what I say

Yes

I am perfectly sure that I am in full agreement with the wishes of
the donor in deciding that the money must remain untouched in my safe
keeping until then

Yes whispered Peer

Whatare you crying

Nno Goodmorning

No pray dont go yet Sit down There are one or two things we must
get settled at once First of allyou must trust me my good boy Do
you believe that I wish you well or do you not

Yes sir

Then it is agreed that all these fancies about going to college and so
forth must be driven out of your head once for all

Yyes sir

You can see yourself that even supposing you had the mental
qualifications such a sum generous as it is in itself would not
suffice to carry you far

Nono sir

On the other hand if you wish it I will gladly arrange to get you an
apprentices place with a good handicraftsman here You would have free
board there andwell if you should want clothes the first year or so
I dare say we could manage that You will be better without pocketmoney
to fling about until you can earn it for yourself

Peer sighed and drooped as he stood When he saw the greenbacked book
locked into its drawer again and heard the keys rattle as they went
back into a pocket under the dressinggown he felt as if some one were
pointing a jeering finger at him and saying Yah

Then theres another thing About your name What name have you thought
of taking my ladsurname I mean

My name is Peer Holm said the boy instinctively drawing himself up
as he had done when the bishop had patted his head at the confirmation
and asked his name

The schoolmaster pursed up his lips took off his spectacles and wiped
them put them on again and turned to the bookshelves with a sigh Ah
indeedyesyesI almost thought as much

Then he came forward and laid a hand kindly on Peers shoulder

My dear boythat is out of the question

A shiver went through Peer Had he done something wrong again

See here my boyhave you considered that there may be others of that
name in this same place

Yesbut

Wait a minuteand that you would occasion theseothersthe deepest
pain and distress if it should become known thatwell how matters
stand You see I am treating you as a grownup mana gentleman And
I feel sure you would not wish to inflict a great sorrowa crushing
blowupon a widow and her innocent children There there my boy
theres nothing to cry about Life my young friend life has troubles
that must be faced What is the name of the farm or house where you
have lived up to now

TTroen

Troena very good name indeed Then from today on you will call
yourself Peer Troen

Yyes sir

And if any one should ask about your father remember that you are
bound in honour and conscience not to mention your benefactors name

Yyes

Well then as soon as you have made up your mind come at once and let
me know We shall be great friends yet you will see Youre sure you
wouldnt like to try America Well well come along out to the kitchen
and see if we can find you some breakfast

Peer found himself a moment after sitting on a chair in the kitchen
where there was such a good smell of coffee Bertha said the
schoolmaster coaxingly youll find something good for breakfast for my
young friend here wont you He waved a farewell with his hand took
down his socks from a string above the stove and disappeared through
the door again



Chapter IV


When a country boy in blue homespun with a peaked cap on his blond
head goes wandering at random through the streets of a town it is no
particular concern of any one else He moves along gazing in at shop
windows hands deep in his pockets whistling looking at everything
around himor at nothing at all And yetperhaps in the head under
that peaked cap it seems as if a whole little world had suddenly
collapsed and he may be whistling hard to keep from crying in the
streets for people to see He steps aside to avoid a cart and runs into
a man who drops his cigar in the gutter Confounded country lout
says the man angrily but passes on and has forgotten boy and all the
next moment But a little farther on a big dog comes dashing out of a
yard and unluckily upsets a fat old woman on the pavement and the boy
with the peaked cap for all his troubles cannot help doubling up and
roaring with laughter

That afternoon Peer sat on one of the ramparts below the fortress
biting at a stalk of grass and twirling the end in his fingers Below
him lay town and fjord in the mild October sunlight the rumble of
traffic the noises from workshops and harbour came up to him through
the rustbrown luminous haze There he sat while the sentry on the
wall above marched back and forth with his rifle on his shoulder
leftrightleft

You may climb very high up indeed and fall down very deep and no such
terrible harm done after all as long as you dont absolutely break your
neck And gradually Peer began to realise that he was still alive after
all It is a bad business when the world goes against you even though
you may have some one to turn to for advice and sympathy But when all
the people round you are utter strangers there is nothing to be done
but sit down and twirl a straw and think things out a bit for yourself
Peers thoughts were of a thing in a long dressinggown that had taken
his bank book and locked it up and rattled the keys at him and said
Yah and deposed him from his bishopric and tried to sneeze and
squeeze him into a trade where hed have to carry a pressingiron all
his life and be Peer Troen Tailor But he wouldnt have that He sat
there bracing himself up and trying to gather together from somewhere
a thing he had never had much need of beforeto wit a will of his own
something to set up against the whole wide world What was he to do now
He felt he would like to go back to Troen first of all and talk things
over with the old father and mother they would be sorry for him there
and say Poor boy and pray for himbut after a day or two he knew
they would begin to glance at him at meals and remember that there was
no one to pay for him now and that times were hard No that was no
refuge for him now But what could he do then Clearly it was not such
a simple matter to be all alone in the world

A little later he found himself on a hillside by the Cathedral
churchyard sitting under the yellowing trees and wondering dreamily
where his father was to be buried What a difference between him and
that schoolmaster man No preaching with him no whining about what his
boy might call himself or might not Why must he go and die

It was strange to think of that fine strong man who had brushed his
hair and beard so carefully with his silverbacked brushto think that
he was lying still in a coffin now and would soon be covered up with
earth

People were coming up the hill now and passing in to the churchyard
The men wore black clothes and tall shiny hatsbut there were some
officers too with plumes and sashes And then a regimental bandwith
its brass instruments Peer slipped into the churchyard with the crowd
but kept apart from the rest and took up his stand a little way off
beside a big monument It must be fathers funeral he thought to
himself and was broad awake at once

This he guessed must be the Cadet School that came marching in and
formed up in two lines from the mortuary chapel to the open grave
The place was nearly full of people now there were women holding
handkerchiefs to their eyes and an elderly lady in black went into
the chapel on the arm of a tall man in uniform That must be fathers
wife thought Peer and the young ladies there in black aremy
halfsisters and that young lieutenantmy halfbrother How strange
it all was A sound of singing came from the chapel And a little later
six sergeants came out carrying a coffin all heaped with flowers
Present arms And the soldiers presented and the band played a slow
march and moved off in front of the coffin between the two lines of
soldiers And then came a great following of mourners The lady in black
came out again sobbing behind her handkerchief and hardly able to
follow though she clung to the tall officers arm But in front of
the pair just behind the coffin itself walked a tall man in splendid
uniform with gold epaulettes plumed hat and sword bearing a cushion
with two jewelled stars And the long long train of mourners moved
slowly gently on and therethere by the grave stood the priest
holding a spade

Peer was anxious to hear what the priest would have to say about his
father Involuntarily he stole a little nearer though he felt somehow
that it would not do to come too close

A hymn was sung at the graveside the band accompanying Peer took off
his cap He was too taken up to notice that one of the mourners was
watching him intently and presently left the group and came towards
him The man wore spectacles and a shiny tall hat and it was not until
he began to sneeze that Peer recognised him It was the schoolmaster
glaring at him now with a face so full of horror and fury that the
spectacles almost seemed to be spitting fire

YouyouAre you mad he whispered in Peers face clenching his
black gloved hands What are you doing here Do you want to cause a
catastrophe today of all days Goget away at once do you hear me
Go For heavens sake get away from here before any one sees Peer
turned and fled hearing behind him as he went a threatening If ever
you dareagain while the voices and the band swelling higher in
the hymn seemed to strike him in the back and drive him on

He was far down in the town before he could stop and pull himself
together One thing was clearafter this he could never face that
schoolmaster again All was lost Could he even be sure that what he had
done wasnt so frightfully wrong that he would have to go to prison for
it

Next day the Troen folk were sitting at their dinner when the eldest son
looked out of the window and said Theres Peer coming

Mercy on us cried the goodwife as he came in What is the matter
Peer Are you ill

Ah it was good that night to creep in under the old familiar skinrug
once more And the old mother sat on the bedside and talked to him
of the Lord by way of comfort Peer clenched his hands under the
clothessomehow he thought now of the Lord as a sort of schoolmaster
in a dressinggown Yet it was some comfort all the same to have the old
soul sit there and talk to him

Peer had much to put up with in the days that followedmuch tittering
and whispers of Look there goes the priest as he went by At
table he felt ashamed of every mouthful he took he hunted for jobs as
daylabourer on distant farms so as to earn a little to help pay for
his keep And when the winter came he would have to do as the others
didhire himself out young and small as he was for the Lofoten
fishing

But one day after church Klaus Brock drew him aside and got him to talk
things over at length First Klaus told him that he himself was going
awayhe was to begin in one of the mechanical workshops in town and
go from there to the Technical College to qualify for an engineer And
next he wanted to hear the whole truth about what had happened to
Peer that day in town For when people went slapping their thighs and
sniggering about the young wouldbe priest that had turned out a
beggar Klaus felt he would like to give the lot of them a darned good
hammering

So the two sixteenyearold boys wandered up and down talking and
in the days to come Peer never forgot how his old accomplice in the
sharkfishing had stood by him now Do like me urged Klaus Youre
a bit of a smith already man go to the workshops and read up in your
spare time for the entrance exam to the Technical Then three years at
the Collegethe eighteen hundred crowns will cover thatand there you
are an engineerand neednt even owe any one a halfpenny

Peer shook his head he was sure he would never dare to show his face
before that schoolmaster again much less ask for the money in the bank
No the whole thing was over and done with for him

But devil take it man surely you can see that this ape of a
schoolmaster dare not keep you out of your money Let me come with you
well go up and tackle him together and thenthen youll see And
Klaus clenched his fists and thrust out one shoulder fiercely

But when January came there was Peer in oilskins in the focsle of
a Lofoten fishingsmack ploughing the long searoad north to the
fishinggrounds in frost and snowstorms All through that winter he
lived the fishermans life on land in one of the tiny fisherbooths
where a fiveman crew is packed like sardines in an air so thick you can
cut it with a knife at sea where in a fair wind you stand half the day
doing nothing and freezing stiff the whileand a foul wind means out
oars and row row row over an endless plain of rolling icy combers
row row till ones hands are lumps of bleeding flesh Peer lived
through it all thinking now and then when he could think at all how
the grand gentlefolk had driven him out to this life because he was
impertinent enough to exist And when the fourteen weeks were past and
the Lofoten boats stood into the fjord again on a mild spring day it
was easy for Peer to reckon out his earnings which were just nothing at
all He had had to borrow money for his outfit and food and he would be
lucky if his boys share was enough to cover what he owed

A few weeks later a boy stood by the yard gate of an engineering works
in the town just as the bell was ringing and the men came streaming out
and asked for Klaus Brock

Hullo Peerthat you Been to Lofoten and made your fortune

The two boys stood a moment taking stock of one another Klaus
grimyfaced and in workingclothesPeer weatherbeaten and tanned by
storm and spray

The manager of the factory was Klauss uncle and the same afternoon his
nephew came into the office with a new hand wanting to be taken on as
apprentice He had done some smithy work before he said and he was
taken on forthwith at a wage of twopence an hour

And whats your name

Peererthe rest stuck in his throat

Holm put in Klaus

Peer Holm Very well thatll do

The two boys went out with a feeling of having done something rather
daring And anyway if trouble should come along there would be two of
them now to tackle it



Chapter V


In a narrow alley off Sea Street lived Gorseth the jobmaster with a
household consisting of a lean and skinny wife two halfstarved horses
and a few ramshackle flies and sledges The jobmaster himself was a
hulking toper with red nose and beeryyellow eyes who spent his nights
in drinking and got home in the small hours of the morning when his wife
was just about getting up All through the morning she went about the
place scolding and storming at him for a drunken neerdowell while
Gorseth himself lay comfortably snoring

When Peer arrived on the scene with his box on his shoulder Gorseth was
on his knees in the yard greasing a pair of leather carriageaprons
while his wife sunkenlipped and fierceeyed stood in the kitchen
doorway abusing him for a profligate a swine and the scum of the
earth Gorseth lay there on allfours with the sun shining on his bald
head smearing on the grease but every now and then he would lift his
head and snarl out Hold your jaw you damned old jade

Havent you a room to let Peer asked

A beery nose was turned towards him and the man dragged himself up and
wiped his hands on his trousers Right you are said he and led the
way across the yard up some stairs and into a little room with two
panes of glass looking on to the street and a halfwindow on the yard
The room had a bed with sheets a couple of chairs and a table in front
of the halfwindow Six and six a month Agreed Peer took it on the
spot paid down the first months rent and having got rid of the man
sat down on his chest and looked about him Many people have never a
roof to their heads but here was he Peer with a home of his own
Outside in the yard the woman had begun yelping her abuse again the
horses in the stable beneath were stamping and whinnying but Peer
had lodged in fisherbooths and peasants quarters and was not too
particular Here he was for the first time in a place of his own and
within its walls was master of the house and his own master

Food was the next thing He went out and bought in supplies stocking
his chest with plain country fare At dinner time he sat on the lid
as fishermen do and made a good solid meal of flat bannocks and cold
bacon

And now he fellto at his new work There was no question of whether it
was what he wanted or not here was a chance of getting up in the world
and that without having to beg any ones leave He meant to get on And
it was not long before his dreams began to take a new shape from his new
life He stood at the bottom of a ladder a blacksmiths boybut up
at the top sat a mighty Chief Engineer with gold spectacles and white
waistcoat That was where he would be one day And if any schoolmaster
came along and tried to keep him back this timewell just let him
try it They had turned him out of a churchyard oncehe would have his
revenge for that some day It might take him years and years to do it
but one fine day he would be as good as the best of them and would pay
them back in full

In the misty mornings as he tramped in to his work dinnerpail in
hand his footsteps on the plank bridge seemed hammering out with
concentrated will Today I shall learn something newnewnew

The great works down at the harbourshipyard foundry and machine
shopswere a whole city in themselves And into this world of fire and
smoke and glowing iron steamhammers racing wheels and bustle and
noise he was thrusting his way intent upon one thing to learn and
learn and ever learn There were plenty of those by him who were content
to know their way about the little corner where they stoodbut they
would never get any farther They would end their days brokendown
workmenHE would carve his way through till he stood among the masters
He had first to put in some months work in the smithy then he would
be passed on to the machine shops then to work with the carpenters
and painters and finally in the shipyard The whole thing would take
a couple of years But the works and all therein were already a kind of
new Bible to him a book of books which he must learn by heart Only
wait

And what a place it was for new adventures Many times a day he
would find himself gazing at some new wonder sheer miracle and
revelationyet withal no creation of Gods grace but an invention of
men Press a button and behold a miracle springs to life He would
stare at the things and the strain of understanding them would
sometimes keep him awake at night There was something behind this
something that must bespirit even though it did not come from God
These engineers were priests of a sort albeit they did not preach nor
pray It was a new world

One day he was put to riveting work on an enormous boiler and for the
first time found himself working with a power that was not the power of
his own hands It was a tube full of compressed air that drove home
the rivets in quick succession with a clashing wail from the boiler that
sounded all over the town Peers head and ears ached with the noise
but he smiled all the same He was used to toil himself in weariness of
body now he stood here master was mind and soul and directing will He
felt it now for the first time and it sent a thrill of triumph through
every nerve of his body

But all through the long evenings he sat alone reading reading and
heard the horses stamping in the stable below And when he crept
into bed well after midnight there was only one thing that troubled
himhis utter loneliness Klaus Brock lived with his uncle in a fine
house and went to parties And he lay here all by himself If he were
to die that very night there would be hardly a soul to care So utterly
alone he wasin a strange and indifferent world

Sometimes it helped him a little to think of the old mother at Troen
or of the church at home where the vaulted roof had soared so high over
the swelling organnotes and all the faces had looked so beautiful But
the evening prayer was no longer what it had been for him There was no
greyhaired bishop any more sitting at the top of the ladder he was to
climb The Chief Engineer that was there now had nothing to do with Our
Lord or with life in the world to come He would never come so far now
that he could go down into the place of torment where his mother lay
and bring her up with him up to salvation And whatever power and
might he gained he could never stand in autumn evenings and lift up his
finger and make all the stars break into song

Something was past and gone for Peer It was as if he were rowing away
from a coast where red clouds hung in the sky and dreamvisions filled
the airrowing farther and farther away towards something quite new A
power stronger than himself had willed it so

One Sunday as he sat reading the door opened and Klaus Brock entered
whistling with his cap on the back of his head

Hullo old boy So this is where you live

Yes it isand thats a chair over there

But Klaus remained standing with his hands in his pockets and his cap
on staring about the room Well Im blest he said at last If he
hasnt stuck up a photograph of himself on his table

Well did you never see one before Dont you know everybody has them

Not their own photos you ass If anybody sees that youll never hear
the last of it

Peer took up the photograph and flung it under the bed Well it was a
rubbishy thing he muttered Evidently he had made a mistake But what
about thispointing to a coloured picture he had nailed up on the
wall

Klaus put on his most manly air and bit off a piece of tobacco plug
Ah that he said trying not to laugh too soon

Yes its a fine painting isnt it I got it for fourpence

Painting Haha thats good Why you silly cow cant you see its
only an oleograph

Oh of course you know all about it You always do

Ill take you along one day to the Art Gallery said Klaus Then
you can see what a real painting looks like Whats that youve got
thereEnglish reader

Yes put in Peer eagerly hear me say a poem And before Klaus could
protest he had begun to recite

When he had finished Klaus sat for a while in silence chewing his
quid Hm he said at last if our last teacher Froken Zebbelin
could have heard that English of yours wed have had to send for a
nurse for her hanged if we wouldnt

This was too much Peer flung the book against the wall and told the
other to clear out to the devil When Klaus at last managed to get a
word in he said

If you are to pass your entrance at the Technical youll have to have
lessonssurely you can see that You must get hold of a teacher

Easy for you to talk about teachers Let me tell you my pay is twopence
an hour

Ill find you one who can take you twice a week or so in languages and
history and mathematics I daresay some brokendown sot of a student
would take you on for sevenpence a lesson You could run to that
surely

Peer was quiet now and a little pensive Well if I give up butter and
drink water instead of coffee

Klaus laughed but his eyes were moist Hard luck that he couldnt offer
to lend his comrade a few shillingsbut it wouldnt do

So the summer passed On Sundays Peer would watch the young folks
setting out in the morning for the country to spend the whole day
wandering in the fields and woods while he sat indoors over his books
And in the evening he would stick his head out of his twopaned window
that looked on to the street and would see the lads and girls coming
back flushed and noisy with flowers and green boughs in their hats
crazy with sunshine and fresh air And still he must sit and read on
But in the autumn when the long nights set in he would go for a walk
through the streets before going to bed as often as not up to the white
wooden house where the manager lived This was Klauss home Lights in
the windows and often music the happy people that lived here knew and
could do all sorts of things that could never be learned from books No
mistake he had a goodish way to goa long long way But get there he
would

One day Klaus happened to mention quite casually where Colonel Holms
widow lived and late one evening Peer made his way out there and
cautiously approached the house It was in River Street almost hidden
in a cluster of great trees and Peer stood there leaning against the
garden fence trembling with some obscure emotion The long rows of
windows on both floors were lighted up he could hear youthful laughter
within and then a young girls voice singingdoubtless they were
having a party Peer turned up his collar against the wind and tramped
back through the town to his lodging above the carters stable

For the lonely working boy Saturday evening is a sort of festival He
treats himself to an extra wash gets out his clean underclothes from
his chest and changes And the smell of the newlywashed underclothing
calls up keenly the thought of a pockmarked old woman who sewed
and patched it all and laid it away so neatly folded He puts it on
carefully feeling almost as if it were Sunday already

Now and again when a Sunday seemed too long Peer would drift into the
nearest church What the parson said was all very good no doubt but
Peer did not listen for him there were only the hymns the organ the
lofty vaulted roof the coloured windows Here too the faces of the
people looked otherwise than in the street without touched as it were
by some reflection from all that their thoughts aspired to reach And
it was so homelike here Peer even felt a sort of kinship with them all
though every soul there was a total stranger

But at last one day to his surprise in the middle of a hymn a voice
within him whispered suddenly You should write to your sister Shes
as much alone in the world as you are

And one evening Peer sat down and wrote He took quite a lordly tone
saying that if she wanted help in any way she need only let him know
And if she would care to move in to town she could come and live with
him After which he remained her affectionate brother Peer Holm
engineer apprentice

A few days later there came a letter addressed in a fine slanting hand
Louise had just been confirmed The farmer she was with wished to keep
her on as dairymaid through the winter but she was afraid the work
would be too heavy for her So she was coming in to town by the boat
arriving on Sunday evening With kind regards his sister Louise Hagen

Peer was rather startled He seemed to have taken a good deal on his
shoulders

On Sunday evening he put on his blue suit and stiff felt hat and walked
down to the quay For the first time in his life he had some one else to
look afterhe was to be a father and benefactor from now on to some one
worse off than himself This was something new The thought came back to
him of the jolly gentleman who had come driving down one day to Troen to
look after his little son Yes that was the way to do things that was
the sort of man he would be And involuntarily he fell into something of
his fathers look and step his smile his lavish careless air Well
wellwell wellwell well he seemed saying to himself He might
almost in his fancy have had a neat irongrey beard on his chin

The little green steamboat rounded the point and lay in to the quay
the gangways were run out porters jumped aboard and all the passengers
came bundling ashore Peer wondered how he was to know her this sister
whom he had never seen

The crowd on deck soon thinned and people began moving off from the
quay into the town

Then Peer was aware of a young peasantgirl with a box in one hand and
a violincase in the other She wore a grey dress with a black kerchief
over her fair hair her face was pale and finely cut It was his
mothers face his mother as a girl of sixteen Now she was looking
about her and now her eyes rested on him half afraid half inquiring

Is it you Louise

Is that you Peer

They stood for a moment smiling and measuring each other with their
eyes and then shook hands

Together they carried the box up through the town and Peer was so much
of a townsman already that he felt a little ashamed to find himself
walking through the streets holding one end of a trunk with a
peasantgirl at the other And what a clatter her thick shoes made on
the pavement But all the time he was ashamed to feel ashamed Those
blue arch eyes of hers constantly glancing up at him what were they
saying Yes I have come they saidand Ive no one but you in all
the worldand here I am they kept on saying

Can you play that he asked with a glance at her violincase

Oh well my playings only nonsense she laughed And she told how the
old sexton she had been living with last had not been able to afford a
new dress for her confirmation and had given her the violin instead

Then didnt you have a new dress to be confirmed in

No

But wasnt itdidnt you feel horrible with the other girls standing
by you all dressed up fine

She shut her eyes for a moment Oh yesit WAS horrid she said

A little farther on she asked Were you boarded out at a lot of
places

Five I think

Poohwhy thats nothing I was at nine I was The girl was smiling
again

When they came up to his room she stood for a moment looking round the
place It was hardly what she had expected to find And she had not been
in town lodgings before and her nose wrinkled up a little as she smelt
the close air It seemed so stuffy and so dark

Well light the lamp he said

Presently she laughed a little shyly and asked where she was to sleep

Lord bless us you may well ask Peer scratched his head Theres
only one bed you see At that they both burst out laughing

The one of usll have to sleep on the floor suggested the girl

Right The very thing said he delighted Ive two pillows you can
have one And two rugsanyway you wont be cold

And then I can put on my other dress over she said And maybe youll
have an old overcoat

Splendid So we neednt bother any more about that

But where do you get your food from She evidently meant to have
everything cleared up at once

Peer felt rather ashamed that he hadnt money enough to invite her to a
meal at an eatinghouse then and there But he had to pay his teachers
fees the next day and his storebox wanted refilling too

I boil the coffee on the stove there overnight he said so that its
all ready in the morning And the dry food I keep in that box there
Well see about some supper now He opened the box fished out a loaf
and some butter and put the kettle on the stove She helped him to
clear the papers off the table and spread the feast on it There was
only one knife but it was really much better fun that way than if he
had had two And soon they were seated on their chairsthey had a chair
eachhaving their first meal in their own home he and she together

It was settled that Louise should sleep on the floor and they both
laughed a great deal as he tucked her in carefully so that she shouldnt
feel cold It was not till afterwards when the lamp was out that
they noticed that the autumn gales had set in and there was a loud
northwester howling over the housetops And there they lay chatting to
each other in the dark before falling asleep

It seemed a strange and new thing to Peer this really having a relation
of his ownand a girl tooa young woman There she lay on the floor
near by him and from now on he was responsible for what was to become
of her in the world How should he put that job through

He could hear her turning over The floor was hard very likely

Louise

Yes

Did you ever see mother

No

Or your father

My father She gave a little laugh

Yes havent you ever seen him either

Why how should I silly Who says that mother knew herself who it
was

There was a pause Then Peer brought out rather awkwardly Were all
alone thenyou and I

Yeswe are that

Louise What are you thinking of taking to now

What are you

So Peer told her all his plans She said nothing for a little whileno
doubt she was lying thinking of the grand things he had before him

At last she spoke Do you thinkdoes it cost very much to learn to be
a midwife

A midwifeis that what you want to be girl Peer couldnt help
laughing So this was what she had been planning in these dayssince he
had offered to help her on in the world

Do you think my hands are too big she ventured presentlyhe could
just hear the whisper

Peer felt a pang of pity He had noticed already how ill the red swollen
hands matched her pale clearcut face and he knew that in the country
when any one has small fine hands people call them midwifes hands

Well manage it somehow I daresay said Peer turning round to the
wall He had heard that it cost several hundred crowns to go through the
course at the midwifery school It would be years before he could get
together anything like that sum Poor girl it looked as if she would
have a long time to wait

After that they fell silent The northwester roared over the housetops
and presently brother and sister were asleep

When Peer awoke the next morning Louise was about already making
coffee over the little stove Then she opened her box took out a yellow
petticoat and hung it on a nail placed a pair of new shoes against the
wall lifted out some underlinen and woollen stockings looked at them
and put them back again The little box held all her worldly goods

As Peer was getting up Gracious mercy she cried suddenly what is
that awful noise down in the yard

Oh thats nothing to worry about said Peer Its only the
jobmaster and his wife They carry on like that every blessed morning
youll soon get used to it

Soon they were seated once more at the little table drinking coffee
and laughing and looking at each other Louise had found time to do her
hairthe two fair plaits hung down over her shoulders

It was time for Peer to be off and warning the girl not to go too far
from home and get lost he ran down the stairs

At the works he met Klaus Brock and told him that his sister had come
to town

But what are you going to do with her asked Klaus

Oh shell stay with me for the present

Stay with you But youve only got one room and one bed man

Wellshe can sleep on the floor

She Your sister Shes to sleep on the floorand you in the bed
gasped Klaus

Peer saw he had made a mistake again Of course I was only fooling he
hastened to say Of course its Louise thats to have the bed

When he came home he found she had borrowed a fryingpan from the
carters wife and had fried some bacon and boiled potatoes so that
they sat down to a dinner fit for a prince

But when the girls eyes fell on the coloured print on the wall and
she asked if it was a painting Peer became very grand at once Thata
painting Why thats only an oleograph silly No Ill take you along
to the Art Gallery one day and show you what real paintings are like
And he sat drumming with his fingers on the table and saying Well
wellwell well well

They agreed that Louise had better look out at once for some work to
help things along And at the first eatinghouse they tried she was
taken on at once in the kitchen to wash the floor and peel potatoes

When bedtime came he insisted on Louise taking the bed Of course all
that was only a joke last night he explained Here in town women
always have the best of everythingthats whats called manners As he
stretched himself on the hard floor he had a strange new feeling The
narrow little garret seemed to have widened out now that he had to find
room in it for a guest There was something not unpleasant even in lying
on the hard floor since he had chosen to do it for some one elses
sake

After the lamp was out he lay for a while listening to her breathing
Then at last

Louise

Yes

Is your fatherwas his name Hagen

Yes It says so on the certificate

Then youre Froken Hagen Sounds quite fine doesnt it

Uf Now youre making fun of me

And when youre a midwife Froken Hagen might quite well marry a
doctor you know

Silly Theres no chancewith hands like mine

Do you think your hands are too big for you to marry a doctor

Uf you ARE a crazy thing Hahaha

Hahaha

They both snuggled down under the clothes with the sense of ease and
peace that comes from sharing a room with a good friend in a happy
humour

Well goodnight Louise

Goodnight Peer



Chapter VI


So things went on till winter was far spent Now that Louise too was
a wageearner and could help with the expenses they could dine
luxuriously at an eatinghouse every day if they pleased on meatcakes
at fourpence a portion They managed to get a bed for Peer that could
be folded up during the day and soon learned too that good manners
required they should hang up Louises big woollen shawl between them
as a modest screen while they were dressing and undressing And Louise
began to drop her country speech and talk cityfashion like her brother

One thought often came to Peer as he lay awake The girl is the very
image of mother thats certainwhat if she were to go the same way
Well no that she shall not Youre surely man enough to see to that
Nothing of that sort shall happen my dear Froken Hagen

They saw but little of each other during the day though for they were
apart from early in the morning till he came home in the evening And
when he lectured her and warned her to be careful and take no notice
of men who tried to speak to her Louise only laughed When Klaus Brock
came up one day to visit them and made great play with his eyes while
he talked to her Peer felt much inclined to take him by the scruff of
the neck and throw him downstairs

When Christmastime was near they would wander in the long evenings
through the streets and look in at the dazzlingly lit shopwindows with
their tempting glittering show of gold and finery Louise kept asking
continually how much he thought this thing or that costthat lace
or the cloak or the stockings or those gold brooches Wait till you
marry that doctor Peer would say then you can buy all those
things So far neither of them had an overcoat but Peer turned up his
coatcollar when he felt cold and Louise made the most of her thick
woollen dress and a pair of good country gloves that kept her quite
warm And she had adventured on a hat now in place of her kerchief and
couldnt help glancing round thinking people must notice how fine she
was

On Christmas Eve he carried up buckets of water from the yard and she
had a great scrubbingout of the whole room And then they in their
turn had a good wash helping each other in country fashion to scrub
shoulders and back

Peer was enough of a townsman now to have laid in a few little presents
to give his sister but the girl who had not been used to such doings
had nothing for him and wept a good deal when she realised it They ate
cakes from the confectioners with syrup over them and drank chocolate
and then Louise played a hymntune in her best style on her violin
and Peer read the Christmas lessons from the prayerbookit was all
just like what they used to do at Troen on Christmas Eve And that
night after the lamp was put out they lay awake talking over plans for
the future They promised each other that when they had got well on in
the world he in his line and she in hers they would manage to live
near each other so that their children could play together and grow
up good friends Didnt she think that was a good idea Yes indeed she
did And did he really mean it Yes of course he meant it really

But later on in the winter when she sat at home in the evenings waiting
for himhe often worked overtimeshe was sometimes almost afraid
There was his step on the stairs If it was hurried and eager she would
tremble a little For the moment he was inside the door he would burst
out Hurrah my girl Ive learnt something new today I tell you
Have you Peer And then out would pour a torrent of talk about
motors and power and pressures and cylinders and cranes and screws and
suchlike She would sit and listen and smile but of course understood
not a word of it all and as soon as Peer discovered this he would get
perfectly furious and call her a little blockhead

Then there were the long evenings when he sat at home reading by
himself or with his teacher and she had to sit so desperately still that
she hardly dared take a stitch with her needle But one day he took it
into his head that his sister ought to be studying too so he set her
a piece of history to learn by the next evening But time to learn
itwhere was that to come from And then he started her writing to his
dictation to improve her spellingand all the time she kept dropping
off to sleep She had washed so many floors and peeled so many potatoes
in the daytime that now her body felt like lead

Look here my fine girl he would storm at her raging up and down
the room if you think you can get on in the world without education
youre most infernally mistaken He succeeded in reducing her to
tearsbut it wasnt long before her head had fallen forward on the
table again and she was fast asleep So he realised there was nothing
for it but to help her to bedas quietly as possible so as not to wake
her up

Some way on in the spring Peer fell sick When the doctor came he
looked round the room sniffed and frowned Do you call this a place
for human beings to live in he asked Louise who had taken the day
off How can you expect to keep well

He examined Peer who lay coughing his face a burning red Yes
yesjust as I expected Inflammation of the lungs He glanced round
the room once more Better get him off to the hospital at once he
said

Louise sat there in terror at the idea that Peer was to be taken away
And then as the doctor was going he looked at her more closely and
said Youd do well to be a bit careful yourself my good girl You
look as if you wanted a change to a decent room with a little more
light and air pretty badly Goodmorning

Soon after he was gone the hospital ambulance arrived Peer was carried
down the stairs on a stretcher and the greenpainted box on wheels
opened its door and swallowed him up and they would not even let her go
with him All through the evening she sat in their room alone sobbing

The hospital was one of the good oldfashioned kind that people dont
come near if they can help it because the walls seem to reek of the
discomfort and wretchedness that reign inside The general wardswhere
the poor folks wentwere always so overcrowded that patients with all
sorts of different diseases had to be packed into the same rooms and
often infected each other When an operation was to be performed things
were managed in the most cheerfully casual way the patient was laid
on a stretcher and carried across the open yard often in the depth of
winter and as he was always covered up with a rug the others usually
thought he was being taken off to the deadhouse

When Peer opened his eyes he was aware of a man in a white blouse
standing by the foot of his bed Why I believe hes comingto said
the man who seemed to be a doctor Peer found out afterwards from a
nurse that he had been unconscious for more than twentyfour hours

He lay there day after day conscious of nothing but the stabbing of
a redhot iron boring through his chest and cutting off his breathing
Some one would come every now and then and pour port wine and naphtha
into his mouth and morning and evening he was washed carefully with
warm water by gentle hands But little by little the room grew lighter
and his gruel began to have some taste And at last he began to
distinguish the people in the beds near by and to chat with them

On his right lay a blackhaired yellowfaced dock labourer with a
broken nose His disease whatever it might be was clearly different
from Peers He plagued the nurse with foulmouthed complaints of
the food swearing he would report about it On the other side lay an
emaciated cobbler with a soft brown beard like the Christ pictures and
cheeks glowing with fever He was dying of cancer At right angles with
him lay a man with the face and figure of a propheta Mosesall bushy
white hair and beard he was in the last stage of consumption and his
cough was like a riveting machine Huh he would groan if only I
could get across to Germany thered be a chance for me yet Beside him
was a fellow with short beard and piercing eyes who was a little off
his head and imagined himself a corporal of the Guards Often at night
the others would be wakened by his springing upright in bed and calling
out Attention

One man lay moaning and groaning all the time turning from side to side
of a body covered with sores But one day he managed to swallow some of
the alcohol they used as lotion and after that lay singing and weeping
alternately And there was a redbearded man with glasses a commercial
traveller he had put a bullet into his head but the doctors had
managed to get it out again and now he lay and praised the Lord for his
miraculous deliverance

It was strange to Peer to lie awake at night in this great room in the
dim light of the nightlamp it seemed as if beings from the land of the
dead were stirring in those beds round about him But in the daytime
when friends and relations of the patients came avisiting Peer could
hardly keep from crying The cobbler had a wife and a little girl who
came and sat beside him gazing at him as if they could never let him
go The prophet too had a wife who wept inconsolablyand all the
rest seemed to have some one or other to care for them But where was
Louisewhy did Louise never come

The man on the right had a sister who came sweeping in gorgeous in her
trailing soiled silk dress Her shoes were down at heel but her hat was
a wonder with enormous plumes Hallo Ugly how goes it she said
and sat down and crossed her legs Then the pair would talk mysteriously
of people with strange names The Flea Cockroach The Galliot
King Ring and the like evidently friends of theirs One day she
managed to bring in a small bottle of brandy a present from The
Hedgehog and smuggle it under the bedclothes As soon as she had gone
and the coast was clear Peers neighbour drew out the bottle managed
to work the cork out and offered him a drink Heres luck sonny do
you good NoPeer would rather not Then followed a gurgling sound
from the dockers bed and soon he too was lying singing at the top of
his voice

At last one day Louise came She was wearing her neat hat and had a
little bundle in her hand and as she came in looking round the room
the close air of the sickward seemed to turn her a little faint But
then she caught sight of Peer and smiled and came cautiously to him
holding out her hand She was astonished to find him so changed But as
she sat down by his pillow she was still smiling though her eyes were
full of tears

So youve come at last then said Peer

They wouldnt let me in before she said with a sob And then Peer
learned that she had come there every single day but only to be told
that he was too ill to see visitors

The man with the broken nose craned his head forward to get a better
view of the modest young girl And meanwhile she was pulling out of
the bundle the offering she had broughta bottle of lemonade and some
oranges

But it was a day or two later that something happened which Peer was
often to remember in the days to come

He had been dozing through the afternoon and when he woke the lamp was
lit and a dull yellow halflight lay over the ward The others seemed
to be sleeping all was very quiet only the man with the sores was
whimpering softly Then the door opened and Peer saw Louise glide in
softly and cautiously with her violincase under her arm She did not
come over to where her brother lay but stood in the middle of the ward
and taking out her violin began to play the Easter hymn The mighty
host in white array


  Den store hvide Flok vi se


The man with the sores ceased whimpering the patients in the beds round
about opened their eyes The docker with the broken nose sat up in bed
and the cobbler roused from his feverish dream lifted himself on his
elbow and whispered It is the Redeemer I knew Thou wouldst come
Then there was silence Louise stood there with eyes fixed on her
violin playing her simple best The consumptive raised his head and
forgot to cough the corporal slowly stiffened his body to attention
the commercial traveller folded his hands and stared before him The
simple tones of the hymn seemed to be giving new life to all these
unfortunates the light of it was in their faces But to Peer watching
his sister as she stood there in the halflight it seemed as if she
grew to be one with the hymn itself and that wings to soar were given
her

When she had finished she came softly over to his bed stroked his
forehead with her swollen hand then glided out and disappeared as
silently as she had come

For a long time all was silent in the dismal ward until at last the
dying cobbler murmured I thank Thee I knewI knew Thou wert not far
away

When Peer left the hospital the doctor said he had better not begin
work again at once he should take a holiday in the country and pick up
his strength Easy enough for you to talk thought Peer and a couple
of days later he was at the workshop again

But his ways with his sister were more considerate than before and he
searched about until he had found her a place as seamstress and saved
her from her heavy floorscrubbing

And soon Louise began to notice with delight that her hands were much
less red and swollen than they had been they were actually getting soft
and pretty by degrees

Next winter she sat at home in the evenings while he read and made
herself a dress and cloak and trimmed a new hat so that Peer soon had
quite an elegant young lady to walk out with But when men turned round
to look at her as she passed he would scowl and clench his fists At
last one day this was too much for Louise and she rebelled Now Peer
I tell you plainly I wont go out with you if you go on like that

All right my girl he growled Ill look after you though never
fear Were not going to have mothers story over again with you

Well but after all Im a grownupgirl and you cant prevent people
looking at me idiot

Klaus Brock had been entered at the Technical College that autumn
and went about now with the College badge in his cap and sported a
walkingstick and a cigarette He had grown into a big broadshouldered
fellow and walked with a little swing in his step a thick shock of
black hair fell over his forehead and he had a way of looking about him
as if to say Anything the matter All right Im ready

One evening he came in and asked Louise to go with him to the theatre
The young girl blushed red with joy and Peer could not refuse but he
was waiting for them outside the yard gate when they came back On a
Sunday soon after Klaus was there again asking her to come out for a
drive This time she did not even look to Peer for leave but said yes
at once Just you wait said Peer to himself And when she came back
that evening he read her a terrific lecture

Soon he could not help seeing that the girl was going about with
halfshut eyes dreaming dreams of which she would never speak to
him And as the days went on her hands grew whiter and she moved more
lightly as if to the rhythm of unheard music Always as she went about
the room on her household tasks she was crooning some song it seemed
that there was some joy in her soul that must find an outlet

One Saturday in the late spring she had just come home and was getting
the supper when Peer came tramping in dressed in his best and carrying
a parcel

Hi girl Here you are Were going to have a rare old feast tonight

Whywhat is it all about

Ive passed my entrance exam for the Technicalhurrah Next
autumnnext autumnIll be a student

Oh splendid I AM so glad And she dried her hand and grasped his

Here you aresausages anchoviesand heres a bottle of brandythe
first I ever bought in my life Klaus is coming up later on to have a
glass of toddy And heres cheese Well make things hum tonight

Klaus came and the two youths drank toddy and smoked and made speeches
and Louise played patriotic songs on her violin and Klaus gazed at her
and asked for moremore

When he left Peer went with him and as the two walked down the street
Klaus took his friends arm and pointed to the pale moon riding high
above the fjord and vowed never to give him up till he stood at the
very top of the treenever never Besides he was a Socialist now he
said and meant to raise a revolt against all class distinctions And
LouiseLouise was the most glorious girl in all the worldand nowand
nowPeer might just as well know it sooner as laterthey were as good
as engaged to be married he and Louise

Peer pushed him away and stood staring at him Go home now and go to
bed he said

Ha You think Im not man enough to defy my peopleto defy the whole
world

Goodnight said Peer

Next morning as Louise lay in bedshe had asked to have her breakfast
there for once in a wayshe suddenly began to laugh What ARE you
about now she asked teasingly

Shaving said Peer beginning operations

Shaving Are you so desperate to be grand today that you must scrape
all your skin off You know theres nothing else to shave

You hold your tongue Little do you know what Ive got in front of me
today

What can it be Youre not going courting an old widow with twelve
children are you

If you want to know Im going to that schoolmaster fellow and going
to wring my savingsbank book out of him

Louise sat up at this My great goodness she said

Yes he had been working himself up to this for a year or more and now
he was going to do it Today he would show what he was made ofwhether
he was a snivelling child or a man that could stand up to any
dressinggown in the world He was shaving for the first timequite
true And the reason was that it was no ordinary day but a great
occasion

His toilet over he put on his best hat with a flourish and set out

Louise stayed at home all the morning waiting for his return And at
last she heard him on the stairs

Puh he said and stood still in the middle of the room

Well Did you get it

He laughed wiped his forehead and drew a greencovered book from his
coatpocket Here we are my girltheres fifty crowns a month for
three years Its going to be a bit of a pinch with fees and books and
living and clothes into the bargain But well do it Father was one of
the right sort I dont care what they say

But how did you manage it What did the schoolmaster say

Do you suppose that youyou with your antecedentscould ever pass
into the Technical College he said And I told him I HAD passed Good
heavens How could you possibly qualify and he shifted his glasses
down his nose And then Oh no its no good coming here with tales of
that sort my lad Well then I showed him the certificate and he got
much meeker Really he said and Dear me and all that But I say
Louisetheres another Holm entered for the autumn term

Peer you dont meanyour halfbrother

And old Dressinggown said it would never donever But I said it
seemed to me there must be room in the world for me as well and Id
like that bank book now I said You seem to fancy you have some legal
right to it he said and got perfectly furious Then I hinted that
Id rather ask a lawyer about it and make sure and at that he regularly
boiled with rage and waved his arms all about But he gave in pretty
soon all the samesaid he washed his hands of the whole thing
And besides he said your names Troen you knowPeer Troen
HohohoPeer Troen Wouldnt he like it TralalalaI say lets
go out and get a little fresh air

Peer said nothing then or after about Klaus Brock and Klaus himself was
going off home for the summer holidays As the summer wore on the town
lay baking in the heat reeking of drains and the air from the stable
came up to the couple in the garret so heavy and foul that they were
sometimes nearly stifled

Ill tell you what said Peer one day we really must spend a few
shillings more on house rent and get a decent place to live in

And Louise agreed For till the time came for him to join the College
in the autumn Peer was obliged to stick to the workshops he could not
afford a holiday just now

One morning he was just starting with a working gang down to Stenkjaer
to repair some damage in the engineroom of a big Russian grain boat
when Louise came and asked him to look at her throat It hurts so
here she said

Peer took a spoon and pressed down her tongue but could not see
anything wrong Better go and see the doctor and make sure he said

But the girl made light of it Oh nonsense she said its not worth
troubling about

Peer was away for over a week sleeping on board with the rest When
he came back he hurried home suddenly thinking of Louise and her sore
throat He found the jobmaster greasing the wheels of a carriage while
his wife leaned out of a window scolding at him Your sister
repeated the carter turning round his face with its great red lump of
noseshes gone to hospitaldiphtheria hospitalshe has Doctor was
here over a week ago and took her off Theyve been here since poking
round and asking who she was and where she belongedwell we didnt
know And asking where you were tooand we didnt know either She was
real bad if you ask me

Peer hastened off It was a hot day and the air was close and heavy
On he wentall down the whole length of Sea Street through the
fishermens quarter and a good way further out round the bay And then
he saw a cart coming towards him an ordinary workcart with a coffin
on it The driver sat on the cart and another man walked behind hat in
hand Peer ran on and at last came in sight of the long yellow building
at the far end of the bay He remembered all the horrible stories he had
heard about the treatment of diphtheria patientshow their throats had
to be cut open to give them air or something burned out of them with
redhot ironsoh When at last he had reached the high fence and rung
the bell he stood breathless and dripping with sweat leaning against
the gate

There was a sound of steps within a key was turned and a porter with a
red moustache and freckles about his hard blue eyes thrust out his head

What dyou want to go ringing like that for

Froken HagenLouise Hagenis she better Howhow is she

LouLouise Hagen A girl called Louise Hagen Is it her youve come to
ask about

Yes Shes my sister Tell meorlet me in to see her

Wait a bit You dont mean a girl that was brought in here about a week
ago

Yes yesbut let me in

Weve had no end of bother and trouble about that girl trying to find
out where she came from and if she had people here But of course
this weather we couldnt possibly keep her any longer Didnt you meet
a coffin on a cart as you came along

Whatwhatyou dont mean

Well you should have come before you know She did ask a lot for some
one called Peer And she got the matron to write somewherewasnt it to
Levanger Were you the fellow she was asking for So you came at last
Oh wellshe died four or five days ago And theyre just gone now to
bury her in St Marys Churchyard

Peer turned round and looked out over the bay at the town that lay
sunlit and smokewreathed beyond Towards the town he began to walk but
his step grew quicker and quicker and at last he took off his cap
and ran panting and sobbing as he went Have I been drinking was the
thought that whirled through his brain or why cant I wake What is
it What is it And still he ran There was no cart in sight as yet the
little streets of the fisherquarter were all twists and turns At last
he reached Sea Street once more and therethere far ahead was
the slowmoving cart Almost at once it turned off to the right and
disappeared and when Peer reached the turning it was not to be seen
Still he ran on at haphazard There seemed to be other people in the
streetschildren flying red balloons women with baskets men with
straw hats and walkingsticks But Peer marked his line and ran
forward thrusting people aside upsetting those in his way and dashing
on again In King Street he came in sight of the cart once more nearer
this time The man walking behind it with his hat in his hand had red
curling hair and walked with a curtsying gait giving at the knees and
turning out his toes No doubt he made his living as mourner at funerals
to which no other mourners came As the cart turned into the churchyard
Peer came up with it and tried to follow at a walk but stumbled and
could hardly keep his feet The man behind the cart looked at him
Whats the matter with you he asked The driver looked round but
drove on again at once

The cart stopped and Peer stood by leaning against a tree for support
A third man came uphe seemed to be the gravediggerand he heard the
three discussing how long they might have to wait for the parson The
times just about up isnt it said the driver taking out his watch
Ay the clerk said hed be here by now agreed the gravedigger and
blew his nose

Soon the priest came in sight wearing his black robe and white ruff
there were doubtless to be other funerals that day Peer sank down on a
bench and looked stupidly on while the coffin was lifted from the cart
carried to the grave and lowered down A man with spectacles and a red
nose came up with a hymnbook and sang something over the grave The
priest lifted the spadeand at the sound of the first spadeful of earth
falling on Louises coffin Peer started as if struck and all but fell
from his seat

When he looked up again the place was deserted The bell was ringing
and a crowd was collecting in another part of the churchyard Peer sat
where he was quite still

In the evening when the gravedigger came to lock the gates he had
to take the young man by the shoulder and shake him to his senses
Lockingup time he said You must go now

Peer rose and tried to walk and by and by he was stumbling blindly out
through the gate and down the street And after a time he found himself
climbing a flight of stairs above a stableyard Once in his room he
flung himself down on the bed as he was and lay there still

The close heat of the day had broken in a downpour of rain which
drummed upon the roof above his head and poured in torrents through the
gutters Instinctively Peer started up Louise was out in the rainshe
would need her cloak He was on his feet in a moment as if to find
itthen he stopped short and sank slowly back upon the bed

He drew up his feet under him and buried his head in his arms His
brain was full of changing hurrying visions of storm and death of
human beings helpless in a universe coldly and indifferently ruled by a
will that knows no pity

Then for the first time it was as if he lifted up his head against
Heaven itself and cried There is no sense in all this I will not bear
it

Later in the night when he found himself mechanically folding his hands
for the evening prayer he had learnt to say as a child he suddenly
burst out laughing and clenched his fists and cried aloud No no
nonevernever again

Once more it came to him that there was something in God like the
schoolmasterHe took the side of those who were well off already Yes
they who have parents and home and brothers and sisters and worldly
goodsthem I protect and care for But heres a boy alone in the world
struggling and fighting his way on as best he canfrom him I will
take the only thing he has That boy is nothing to any one Let him be
punished because he is poor and cast down to the earth for there is
none to care for him That boy is nothing to any onenothing Oh oh
ohhe clenched his fists and beat them against the wall

His whole little world was broken to pieces Either God did not exist at
all or He was cold and pitilessone way of it was as bad as the other
The heavenly country dissolved into cloud and melted away and above
was nothing but empty space No more folding of your hands like a fool
Walk on the earth and lift up your head and defy Heaven and fate
as you defied the schoolmaster Your mother has no need of you to save
hershe is not anywhere any more She is deaddead and turned to clay
and more than that there is not for her or for you or any other being
in this world

Still he lay there He would fain have slept but seemed instead to sink
into a vague faraway twilight that rocked himrocked him on its dark
and golden waves And now he heard a soundwhat was it A violin The
mighty host in white array Louiseis it youand playing He could
see her now out there in the twilight How pale she was But still she
played And now he understood what that twilight was

It was a world beyond the consciousness of daily lifeand that
world belonged to him Peer let me stay here And something in him
answered Yes you shall stay Louise Even though there is no God and
no immortality you shall stay here And then she smiled And still she
played And it was as though he were building a little vaulted chapel
for her in defiance of Heaven and of Godas though he were ringing
out with his own hands a great eternal chime for her sake What was
happening to him There was none to comfort him yet it ended as he
lay there with his pouring out something of his innermost being as an
offering to all that lives to the earth and the stars until all seemed
rocking rocking with him on the stately waves of the psalm He lay
there with fastclosed eyes stretching out his hands as though afraid
to wake and find it all nothing but a beautiful dream



Chapter VII


The twooclock bell at the Technical College had just begun to ring
and a stream of students appeared out of the long straggling buildings
and poured through the gate breaking up then into little knots and
groups that went their several ways into the town

It was a motley crowd of young men of all ages from seventeen to thirty
or more Students of the everlasting type sent here by their parents as
a last resource forhe can always be an engineer young sparks who
paid more attention to their toilet than their books and hoped to
get through somehow without troubling to work and stiff youths of
soldierly bearing who had been ploughed for the Army but who likewise
could always be engineers There were peasantlads who had crammed
themselves through their Intermediate at a spurt and now wore the
College cap above their rough grey homespun and dreamed of getting
through in no time and turning into great men with starched cuffs and
pincenez There were pale young enthusiasts too who would probably
end as actors and there were also quondam actors killed by the
critics but still sufficiently alive it seemed to be engineers And
as the young fellows hurried on their gay and careless way through the
town an older man here and there might look round after them with a
smile of some sadness It was easy to say what fate awaited most of
them College ended they would be scattered like birds of passage
throughout the wide world some to fall by sunstroke in Africa or
be murdered by natives in China others to become mining kings in the
mountains of Peru or heads of great factories in Siberia thousands of
miles from home and friends The whole planet was their home Only a few
of themnot always the shining lightswould stay at home with a post
on the State railways to sit in an office and watch their salaries
mount by increments of L12 every fifth year

Thats a devil of a fellow that brother of yours thats here said
Klaus Brock to Peer one day as they were walking into town together
with their books under their arms

Now look here Klaus once for all be good enough to stop calling
him my brother And another thingyoure never to say a word to any one
about my father having been anything but a farmer My names Holm and
Im called so after my fathers farm Just remember that will you

Oh all right Dont excite yourself

Do you suppose Id give that coxcomb the triumph of thinking I want to
make up to him

No no of course not Klaus shrugged his shoulders and walked on
whistling

Or that I want to make trouble for that fine family of his No I may
find a way to take it out of him some day but it wont be that way

Well but damn it man you can surely stand hearing what people say
about him And Klaus went on to tell his story Ferdinand Holm it
seemed was the despair of his family He had thrown up his studies
at the Military Academy because he thought soldiers and soldiering
ridiculous Then he had made a short experiment with theology but found
that worse still and finally having discovered that engineering was
at any rate an honest trade he had come to anchor at the Technical
College What do you say to that asked Klaus

I dont see anything so remarkable about it

Wait a bit the cream of the storys to come A few weeks ago he
thrashed a policeman in the streetsaid hed insulted a child or
something There was a fearful scandalarrest the policecourt fine
and so forth And last winter what must he do but get engaged formally
and publicly engaged to one of his mothers maids And when his mother
sent the girl off behind his back he raised the standard of revolt
and left home altogether And now he does nothing but breathe fire and
slaughter against the upper classes and all their works What do you say
to that

My good man what the deuce has all this got to do with me

Well I think its confoundedly plucky of him anyhow said Klaus
And for my part I shall get to know him if I can Hes read an awful
lot they say and has a damned clever head on his shoulders

On his very first day at the College Peer had learned who Ferdinand
Holm was and had studied him with interest He was a tall
straightbuilt fellow with reddishblond hair and freckled face and
wore a dark tortoiseshell pincenez He did not wear the usual College
cap but a stiff grey felt hat and he looked about four or five and
twenty

Wait thought Peer to himselfwait my fine fellow Yes you were
there no doubt when they turned me out of the churchyard that day But
all that wont help you here You may have got the start of me at first
and learned this that and the other butyou just wait

But one morning out in the quadrangle he noticed that Ferdinand Holm
in his turn was looking at him in fact was putting his glasses straight
to get a better view of himand Peer turned round at once and walked
away

Ferdinand however had been put into a higher class almost at once on
the strength of his matriculation Also he was going in for a different
branch of the workroads and railway constructionso that it was only
in the quadrangle and the passages that the two ever met

But one afternoon soon after Christmas Peer was standing at work in
the big designingroom when he heard steps behind him and turning
round saw Klaus Brock andFerdinand Holm

I wanted to make your acquaintance said Holm and when Klaus had
introduced them he held out a large white hand with a red sealring on
the first finger Were namesakes I understand and Brock here tells
me you take your name from a country place called Holm

Yes My father was a plain country farmer said Peer and at once felt
annoyed with himself for the ring of humility the words seemed to have

Well the best is good enough said the other with a smile I say
though has the firstterm class gone as far as this in projection
drawing Excuse my asking You see we had a good deal of this sort of
thing at the Military Academy so that I know a little about it

Thought Peer Oh youd like to give me a little good advice
would you if you dared Aloud he said No the drawing was on the
blackboardthe senior class left it thereand I thought Id like to
see what I could make out of it

The other sent him a sidelong glance Then he nodded said
Goodbyehope we shall meet again and walked off his boots creaking
slightly as he went His easy manners his gait the tone of his voice
all seemed to irritate and humiliate Peer Never mindjust let him
wait

Days passed and weeks Peer soon found another object to work for
than getting the better of Ferdinand Holm Louises dresses hung still
untouched in his room her shoes stood under the bed it still seemed
to him that some day she must open the door and walk in And when he
lay there alone at night the riddle was always with him Where is she
nowwhy should she have diedwould he never meet her again He saw
her always as she had stood that day playing to the sick folks in the
hospital ward But now she was dressed in white And it seemed quite
natural now that she had wings He heard her music tooit cradled and
rocked him And all this came to be a little world apart where he could
take refuge for Sunday peace and devotion It had nothing to do with
faith or religion but it was there And sometimes in the midst of
his work in the daytime he would divine as in a quite separate
consciousness the tones of a fiddlebow drawn across the strings like
reddish waves coming to him from far off filling him with harmony till
he smiled without knowing it

Often though a sort of hunger would come upon him to let his being
unfold in a great wide wave of organ music in the church But to church
he never went any more He would stride by a church door with a kind of
defiance It might indeed be an Almighty Will that had taken Louise from
him but if so he did not mean to give thanks to such a Will or bow
down before it It was as though he had in view a coming reckoninghis
reckoning with something far out in eternityand he must see to it that
when that time came he could feel freefree

On Sunday mornings when the church bells began to ring he would
turn hastily to his books as if to find peace in them
Knowledgeknowledgecould it stay his hunger for the music of the
hymn When he had first started work at the shops he had often and
often stood wideeyed before some miraclenow he was gathering the
power to work miracles himself And so he read and read and drank in
all that he could draw from teacher or book and thought and thought
things out for himself Fixed lessons and set tasks were all well
enough but Peer was for ever looking farther for him there were
questions and more questions riddles and new riddlesalways new
always farther and farther on towards the unknown He had made as yet
but one step forward in physics mathematics chemistry he divined that
there were worlds still before him and he must hasten on on on Would
the day ever come when he should reach the end What is knowledge What
use do men make of all that they have learned Look at the teachers who
knew so muchwere they greater richer brighter beings than the rest
Could much study bring a man so far that some night he could lift up a
finger and make the stars themselves break into song Best drive ahead
at any rate But again could knowledge lead on to that ecstasy of the
Sunday psalm that makes all riddles clear that bears a man upwards
in nameless happiness in which his soul expands till it can enfold the
infinite spaces Well at any rate the best thing was to drive ahead
drive ahead both early and late

One day that spring when the trees in the city avenues were beginning
to bud Klaus Brock and Ferdinand Holm were sitting in a cafe in North
Street There goes your friend said Ferdinand and looking from the
window they saw Peer Holm passing the postoffice on the other side of
the road His clothes were shabby his shoes had not been cleaned he
walked slowly his fair head with its College cap bent forward but
seemed nevertheless to notice all that was going on in the street

Wonder what hes going pondering over now said Klaus

Look thereI suppose thats a type of carriage hes never seen before
Why he has got the driver to stop

I wouldnt mind betting hell crawl in between the wheels to find out
whatever hes after laughed Klaus drawing back from the window so as
not to be seen

He looks pale and fagged out said Ferdinand shifting his glasses I
suppose his people arent very well off

Klaus opened his eyes and looked at the other Hes not overburdened
with cash I fancy

They drank off their beer and sat smoking and talking of other things
until Ferdinand remarked casually By the wayabout your friendare
his parents still alive

Klaus was by no means anxious to go into Peers family affairs and
answered brieflyNo he thought not

Im afraid Im boring you with questions but the fact is the
fellow interests me rather There is something in his face
somethingarresting Even the way he walkswhere is it Ive seen some
one walk like that before And he works like a steamengine I hear

Works repeated Klaus Hell ruin his health before long the way he
goes on grinding I believe hes got an idea that by much learning he
can learn at last toHahaha

To do what

Whyto understand God

Ferdinand was staring out of the window Funny enough he said

I ran across him last Sunday up among the hills He was out studying
geology if you please And if theres a lecture anywhere about
anythingwhether its astronomy or a French poetyou can safely swear
hell be sitting there taking notes You cant compete with a fellow
like that Hell run across a new name somewhereAristotle for
instance Its something new and off he must go to the library to look
it up And then hell lie awake for nights after stuffing his head with
translations from the Greek How the deuce can any one keep up with
a man who goes at things that way Theres one thing though that he
knows nothing about

And that is

Well wine and women well sayand fun in general One thing he
isnt by Joveand thats YOUNG

Perhaps hes not been able to afford that sort of thing said
Ferdinand with something like a sigh

The two sat on for some time and every now and then when Klaus was off
his guard Ferdinand would slip in another little question about Peer
And by the time they had finished their second glass Klaus had admitted
that people said Peers mother had been awellno better than she
should be

And what about his father Ferdinand let fall casually

Klaus flushed uncomfortably at this Nobodynonobody knows much
about him he stammered Id tell you if I knew hanged if I wouldnt
No one has an idea who it was Hehes very likely in America

Youre always mighty mysterious when you get on the subject of his
family Ive noticed said Ferdinand with a laugh But Klaus thought
his companion looked a little pale

A few days later Peer was sitting alone in his room above the stables
when he heard a step on the stairs the door opened and Ferdinand Holm
walked in

Peer rose involuntarily and grasped at the back of his chair as if to
steady himself If this young coxcomb had comefrom the schoolmaster
for instanceor to take away his namewhy hed just throw him
downstairs that was all

I thought Id like to look you up and see where you lived began
the visitor laying down his hat and taking a seat Ive taken you
unawares I see Sorry to disturb you But the fact is theres something
I wanted to speak to you about

Oh is there and Peer sat down as far as conveniently possible from
the other

Ive noticed even in the few times weve happened to meet that you
dont like me Well you know thats a thing Im not going to put up
with

What do you mean asked Peer hardly knowing whether to laugh or not

I want to be friends with you thats all You probably know a good
deal more about me than I do about you but that need not matter
Hullodo you always drum with your fingers on the table like that
Hahaha Why that was a habit of my fathers too

Peer stared at the other in silence But his fingers stopped drumming

I rather envy you you know living as you do When you come to be a
millionaire youll have an effective background for your millions And
then you must know a great deal more about life than we do and the
knowledge that comes out of books must have quite another spiritual
value for you than for the rest of us whove been stuffed mechanically
with lessons and education and so forth since we were kids And now
youre going in for engineering

Yes said Peer His face added pretty clearly And what concern is it
of yours

Well it does seem to me that the modern technician is a priest in
his wayor no perhaps I should rather call him a descendant of old
Prometheus Quite a respectable ancestry too dont you think But has
it ever struck you that with every victory over nature won by the human
spirit a fragment of their omnipotence is wrested from the hands of
the gods I always feel as if we were using fire and steel mechanical
energy and human thought as weapons of revolt against the Heavenly
tyranny The day will come when we shall no longer need to pray
The hour will strike when the Heavenly potentates will be forced to
capitulate and in their turn bend the knee to us What do you think
yourself Jehovah doesnt like engineersthats MY opinion

Sounds very well said Peer briefly But he had to admit to himself
that the other had put into words something that had been struggling for
expression in his own mind

Of course for the present we two must be content with smaller things
Ferdinand went on And I dont mind admitting that laying out a bit of
road or a bit of railway or bridging a ditch or so isnt work that
appeals to me tremendously But if a man can get out into the wide
world there are things enough to be done that give him plenty of chance
to develop whats in himif there happens to be anything I used
to envy the great soldiers who went about to the ends of the earth
conquering wild tribes and founding empires organising and civilising
where they went But in our day an engineer can find big jobs too once
he gets out in the worlddraining thousands of square miles of swamp
or regulating the Nile or linking two oceans together Thats the sort
of thing Im going to take a hand in some day As soon as Ive finished
here Im off And well leave it to the engineers to come say in a
couple of hundred years or so to start in arranging tourist routes
between the stars Do you mind my smoking

No please do said Peer But Im sorry I havent

I havethanks all the same Ferdinand took out his cigarcase and
when Peer had declined the offered cigar lit one himself

Look here he said wont you come out and have dinner with me
somewhere

Peer started at his visitor What did all this mean

Im a regular Spartan as a rule but theyve just finished dividing up
my fathers estate so Im in funds for the moment and why shouldnt
we have a little dinner to celebrate If you want to change I can wait
outsidebut come just as you are of course if you prefer

Peer was more and more perplexed Was there something behind all this
Or was the fellow simply an astonishingly good sort Giving it up at
last he changed his collar and put on his best suit and went

For the first time in his life he found himself in a firstclass
restaurant with small tables covered with snowwhite tablecloths
flowers in vases napkins folded sugarloaf shape cutglass bowls and
coloured wineglasses Ferdinand seemed thoroughly at home and treated
his companion with a friendly politeness And during the meal he managed
to make the talk turn most of the time on Peers childhood and early
days

When they had come to the coffee and cigars Ferdinand leaned across the
table towards him and said Look here dont you think we two ought to
say thee and thou to each other


  Tutoyer the mode of address of intimate friendship or
 relationship


Oh yes said Peer really touched now

Were both Holms you know

Yes So we are

And after all who knows that there maynt be some sort of connection
Come now dont look like that I only want you to look on me as your
good friend and to come to me if ever theres anything I can do We
neednt live in each others pockets of course when other people are
bybut we must take in Klaus Brock along with us dont you think

Peer felt a strong impulse to run away Did the other know everything
If so why didnt he speak straight out

As the two walked home in the clear light of the spring evening
Ferdinand took his companions arm and said I dont know if youve
heard that Im not on good terms with my people at home But the very
first time I saw you I had a sort of feeling that we two belonged
together Somehow you seemed to remind me so ofwell to tell the
truth of my father And he let me tell you was a gallant gentleman

Peer did not answer and the matter went no farther then

But the next few days were an exciting time for Peer He could not
quite make out how much Ferdinand knew and nothing on earth would
have induced him to say anything more himself And the other asked no
questions but was just a firstrate comrade behaving as if they had
been friends for years He did not even ask Peer any more about his
childhood and never again referred to his own family Peer was always
reminding himself to be on his guard but could not help feeling glad
all the same whenever they were to meet

He was invited one evening with Klaus to a wineparty at Ferdinands
lodging and found himself in a handsomely furnished room with pictures
on the walls and photographs of his hosts parents There was one of
his father as a young man in uniform another of his grandfather who
had been a Judge of the Supreme Court Its very good of you to be
so interested in my people said Ferdinand with a smile Klaus Brock
looked from one to the other wondering to himself how things really
stood between the two

The summer vacation came round and the students prepared to break up
and go their various ways Klaus was to go home And one day Ferdinand
came to Peer and said Look here old man I want you to do me a great
favour Id arranged to go to the seaside this summer but Ive a
chance of going up to the hills too Well I cant be in two places
at oncecouldnt you take on one of them for me Of course Id pay
all expenses No thank you said Peer with a laugh But when Klaus
Brock came just before leaving and said See here Peer Dont you
think you and I might club together and put a marble slab overLouises
grave Peer was touched and clapped him on the shoulder What a good
old fellow you are Klaus he said

Later in the summer Peer set out alone on a tramp through the country
and whenever he saw a chance he would go up to one of the farms and
say Would you like to have a good map of the farm Itll cost ten
crowns and my lodging while Im at it It made a very pleasant holiday
for him and he came home with a little money in his pocket to boot

His second year at the school was much like the first He plodded along
at his work And now and then his two friends would come and drag him
off for an evenings jollification But after he had been racketing
about with the others singing and shouting through the sleeping
townand at last was alone and in his bed in the darkness another and
a very different life began for him face to face with his innermost
self Where are you heading for Peer What are you aiming at in
all your labours And he would try to answer devoutly as at evening
prayers Where Why of course I am going to be a great engineer And
then I will be one of the Sons of Prometheus that head the revolt
against the tyranny of Heaven And then I will help to raise the great
ladder on which men can climb alofthigher and higher up towards the
light and the spirit and mastery over nature And then Live happily
marry and have children and a rich and beautiful home And then Oh
well one fine day of course one must grow old and die And then And
then Aye what then

At these times he found a shadowy comfort in taking refuge in the world
where Louise stoodplaying as he always saw herand cradling himself
on the smooth red billows of her music But why was it that here most of
all he felt that hunger forfor something more

Ferdinand finished his College course and went out as he had said
into the great world and Klaus went with him And so throughout his
third year Peer was mostly to be seen alone always with books under his
arm and head bent forward

Just as he was getting ready to go up for his final examination a
letter from Ferdinand arrived written from Egypt Come over here
young fellow he wrote We have got good billets at last with a big
British firmBrown Bros of Londona firm thats building railways
in Canada bridges in India harbour works in Argentina and canals and
barrages here in Egypt We can get you a nice little post as draughtsman
to begin with and I enclose funds for the passage out So come along

But Peer did not go at once He stayed on another year at the College
as assistant to the lecturer on mechanics while himself going through
the road and railway construction course as his halfbrother had done
Some secret instinct urged him not to be left behind even in this

As the year went on the letters from his two comrades became more and
more pressing and tempting Out here wrote Klaus the engineer is
a missionary proclaimer not Jehovah but the power and culture of
Europe Youre bound to take a hand in that my boy Theres work worthy
of a great general waiting for you here

At last one autumn day when the woods stood yellow all around the
town Peer drove away from his home with a big new travellingtrunk
strapped to the drivers seat He had been up to the churchyard before
starting with a little bunch of flowers for Louises grave Who could
say if he would ever see it again

At the station he stood for a moment looking back over the old city with
its cathedral and the ancient fortress where the sentry was pacing
back and forth against the skyline Was this the end of his youth
Louisethe room above the stablesthe hospital the lazarette the
College    And there lay the fjord and far out somewhere on the
coast there stood no doubt a little grey fisherhut where a pockmarked
goodwife and her bowlegged goodman had perhaps even now received the
parcel of coffee and tobacco sent them as a parting gift

And so Peer journeyed to the capital and from there out into the wide
world




BOOK II



Chapter I


Some years had passeda good many yearsand once more summer had come
and June A passenger steamer bound from Antwerp to Christiania was
ploughing her way one evening over a sea so motionlessly calm that it
seemed a single vast mirror filled with a sky of grey and pinktinged
clouds There were plenty of passengers on board and no one felt
inclined for bed it was so warm so beautiful on deck Some artists on
their way home from Paris or Munich cast about for amusements to pass
the time some ordered wine others had unearthed a concertina and very
soon no one knew how a dance was in full swing No my dear said
one or two cautious mothers to their girls certainly not But before
long the mothers were dancing themselves Then there was a doctor in
spectacles who stood up on a barrel and made a speech and presently
two of the artists caught hold of the greybearded captain and chaired
him round the deck The night was so clear the skies so ruddily
beautiful the air so soft and out here on the open sea all hearts were
light and happy

Whos that woodenfaced beggar over there thats too high and mighty
for a little fun asked Storaker the painter of his friend the
sculptor Praas

That fellow Oh hes the one that was so infernally instructive at
dinner when we were talking about Egyptian vases

So it is by Jove Schoolmaster abroad I should think When we got
on to Athens and Greek sculpture he condescended to set us right about
that too

I heard him this morning holding forth to the doctor on Assyriology No
wonder he doesnt dance

The passenger they were speaking of was a man of middle height between
thirty and forty apparently who lay stretched in a deckchair a little
way off He was dressed in grey throughout from his travellingcap
to the spats above his brown shoes His face was sallow and the short
brown beard was flecked with grey But his eyes had gay little gleams in
them as they followed the dancers It was Peer Holm

As he sat there watching it annoyed him to feel that he could not let
himself go like the others But it was so long since he had mixed with
his own countrymen that he felt insecure of his footing and almost like
a foreigner among them Besides in a few hours now they should sight
the skerries on the Norwegian coast and the thought awoke in him a
strange excitementit was a moment he had dreamed of many and many a
time out there in the wide world

After a while stillness fell on the decks around him and he too went
below but lay down in his cabin without undressing He thought of
the time when he had passed that way on the outward voyage poor and
unknown and had watched the last island of his native land sink below
the searim Much had happened since thenand now that he had at last
come home what life awaited him there

A little after two in the morning he came on deck again but stood
still in astonishment at finding that the vessel was now boring her way
through a thick woolly fog The devil thought he beginning to tramp up
and down the deck impatiently It seemed that his great moment was to be
lostspoiled for him But suddenly he stopped by the railing and stood
gazing out into the east

What was that Far out in the depths of the woolly fog a glowing spot
appeared the grey mass around grew alive began to move to redden to
thin out as if it were streaming up in flames Ah now he knew It was
the globe of the sun rising out of the sea On board every point where
the nights moisture had lodged began to shine in gold Each moment it
grew clearer and lighter and the eye reached farther And before he
could take in what was happening the grey darkness had rolled itself
up into mounds into mountains that grew buoyant and floated aloft and
melted away And there all revealed lay the fresh bright morning with
a clear sunfilled sky over the blue sea

It was time now to get out his fieldglasses For a long time he stood
motionless gazing intently through them

There Was it his fancy No there far ahead he can see clearly now a
darker strip between sky and sea Its the first skerry It is Norway
at last

Peer felt a sudden catch in his breath he could hardly stand still but
he stopped again and again in his walk to look once more at the faroff
strip of grey And now there were seabirds too with long necks and
swiftlybeating wings Welcome home

And now the steamer is ploughing in among the skerries and a world
of rocks and islets unfolds on every side There is the first red
fisherhut And then the entrance to Christiansand between wooded hills
and islands where white cottages shine out each with its patch of
green grassland and its flagstaff before it

Peer watched it all drinking it in like nourishment How good it all
tastedhe felt it would be long before he had drunk his fill

Then came the voyage up along the coast all through a day of brilliant
sunshine and a luminous night He saw the blue sounds with swarms of
white gulls hovering above them the little coasttowns with their long
whitepainted wooden houses and flowers in the windows He had never
passed this way before and yet something in him seemed to nod and say
I know myself again here All the way up the Christiania Fjord there
was the scent of leaves and meadows big farms stood by the shore
shining in the sun This was what a great farm looked like He
nodded again So warm and fruitful it all seemed and dear to him as
homethough he knew that after all he would be little better than a
tourist in his own country There was no one waiting for him no one to
take him in Still some day things might be very different

As the ship drew alongside the quay at Christiania the other passengers
lined the rail friends and relations came aboard there were tears and
laughter and kisses and embraces Peer lifted his hat as he passed down
the gangway but no one had time to notice him just now And when he
had found a hotel porter to look after his luggage he walked up alone
through the town as if he were a stranger

The light nights made it difficult to sleephe had actually forgotten
that it was light all night long And this was a capital cityyet so
touchingly small it seemed but a few steps wherever he went These were
his countrymen but he knew no one among them there was no one to greet
him Still he thought again some day all this might be very different

At last one day as he stood looking at the window of a booksellers
shop he heard a voice behind him Why bless me surely its Peer
Holm It was one of his fellowstudents at the Technical College
Reidar Langberg pale and thin now as ever He had been a shining light
at the College but nownow he looked shabby worn and aged

I hardly knew you again said Peer grasping the others hand

And youre a millionaire so they sayand famous out in the big
world

Not quite so bad as that old fellow But what about you

I Oh dont talk about me And as they walked down the street
together Langberg poured out his tale of how times were desperately
bad and conditions at home here simply strangled a man He had started
ten or twelve years ago as a draughtsman in the offices of the State
Railways and was still there with a growing familyand such
paysuch pay my dear fellow He threw up his eyes and clasped his
hands despairingly

Look here said Peer interrupting him Where is the best place in
Christiania to go and have a good time in the evening

Well St Hans Hill for instance Theres music there

Rightwill you come and dine with me there tonightshall we say
eight oclock

Thanks I should think I would

Peer arrived in good time and engaged a table on a verandah Langberg
made his appearance shortly after dressed in his wellsaved Sunday
bestfaded frockcoat light trousers bagged at the knees and a straw
hat yellow with age

Its a pleasure to have someone to talk to again said Peer For the
last year or so Ive been knocking about pretty much by myself

Is it as long as that since you left Egypt

Yes longer Ive been in Abyssinia since then

Oh of course I remember now It was in the papers Building a railway
for King Menelik werent you

Oh yes But the last eighteen months or so Ive been idlingrunning
about to theatres and museums and so forth I began at Athens and
finished up with London I remember one day sitting on the steps of the
Parthenon declaiming the Antigoneand a moment with some meaning in it
seemed to have come at last

But dash it man youre surely not comparing such trifles with a
thing like the great Nile Barrage You were on that for some years
werent you Do lets hear something about that Up by the first
cataract wasnt it And hadnt you enormous quarries there on the spot
You see even sitting at home here I havent quite lost touch But
yougood Lord what things you must have seen Fancy living atwhat
was the name of the town again

Assuan answered Peer indifferently looking out over the gardens
where more and more visitors kept arriving

They say the barrage is as great a miracle as the Pyramids How many
sluicegates are there againa hundred and    

Two hundred and sixteen said Peer Look he broke off Do you know
those girls over there He nodded towards a party of girls in light
dresses who were sitting down at a table close by

Langberg shook his head He was greedy for news from the great world
without which he had never had the luck to see

Ive often wondered he went on how you managed to come to the front
so in that sort of workrailways and barrages and so forthwhen your
original line was mechanical engineering Of course you did do an extra
year on the roads and railway side but   

Oh this shining light of the schools

What do you say to a glass of champagne said Peer How do you like
it Sweet or dry

Why is there any difference I really didnt know But when ones a
millionaire of course   

Im not a millionaire said Peer with a smile and beckoned to a
waiter

Oh I heard you were Didnt you invent a new motorpump that drove all
the other types out of the field And besidesthat Abyssinian railway
Oh well well he sighed its a good thing somebodys lucky The rest
of us shouldnt complain But how about the other twoKlaus Brock and
Ferdinand Holm What are they doing now

Klaus is looking after the Khedives estates at Edfina Agriculture by
steam power his own railway lines to bring in the produce and so
on Yes Klaus has ended up in a nice little place of his own His
districts bigger than the kingdom of Denmark

Good heavens Langberg nearly fell off his chair And Ferdinand Holm
what about him

Oh hes got bigger things on hand Went nosing about the Libyan
desert and found that considerable tracts of it have waterveins only a
few yards beneath the surface If so of course its only a question of
proper plant to turn an enormous area into a paradise for corngrowing

Good gracious What a discovery gasped the other almost breathless
now

Peer looked out over the fjord and went on Last year he managed at
last to get the Khedive interested and theyve started a jointstock
company now with a capital of some millions Ferdinand is chief
engineer

And whats his salary As much as fifty thousand crowns

His pay is two hundred thousand francs a year said Peer not without
some fear that his companion might faint Yes hes an able fellow is
Ferdinand

It took Langberg some time to get his breath again At last he asked
with a sidelong glance

And you and Klaus BrockI suppose youve put your millions in his
company

Peer smiled as he sat looking out over the garden Lifting his glass
Your good health he said for all answer

Have you been in America too went on the other No I suppose not

America Yes a few years back when I was with Brown Bros they sent
me over one time to buy plant Nothing so surprising in that is there

No no of course not I was only thinkingyou went about there
I daresay and saw all the wonderful thingsthe miracles of science
theyre always producing

My dear fellow if you only knew how deadly sick I am of miracles
of science What Im longing for is a country watermill that takes
twentyfour hours to grind a sack of corn

What What do you say Langberg bounced in his chair Hahaha
Youre the same old man I can see

Im perfectly serious said Peer lifting his glass towards the other
Come Heres to our old days together

Ayethanks a thousand thanksto our old days togetherAh
delicious Well then I suppose youve fallen in love away down there
in the land of the barbarians Havent you Hahaha

Do you call Egypt a land of barbarians

Well dont the fellahs still yoke their wives to their ploughs

A fellah will sit all night long outside his hut and gaze up at the
stars and give himself time to dream And a merchant prince in Vienna
will dictate business letters in his automobile as hes driving to the
theatre and write telegrams as he sits in the stalls One fine day
hell be sitting in his private box with a telephone at one ear and
listening to the opera with the other Thats what the miracles of
science are doing for us Aweinspiring isnt it

And you talk like thata man thats helped to harness the Nile and
has built railways through the desert

Peer shrugged his shoulders and offered the other a cigar from his
case A waiter appeared with coffee

To help mankind to make quicker progressis that nothing

Lord What Id like to know is where mankind are making for that
theyre in such a hurry

That the Nile Barrage has doubled the production of corn in
Egyptcreated the possibilities of life for millions of human
beingsis that nothing

My good fellow do you really think there arent enough fools on this
earth already Have we too little wailing and misery and discontent and
classhatred as it is Why must we go about to double it

But hang it all manwhat about European culture Surely you felt
yourself a sort of missionary of civilisation where you have been

The spread of European civilisation in the East simply means that half
a dozen big financiers in London or Paris take a fancy to a certain
strip of Africa or Asia They press a button and out come all the
ministers and generals and missionaries and engineers with a bow At
your service gentlemen

Culture One wheel begets ten new ones Brrrrr And the ten again
another hundred Brrrrrrrmore speed more competitionand all for
what For culture No my friend for money Missionary I tell you as
long as Western Europe with all its wonders of modern science and its
Christianity and its political reforms hasnt turned out a better type
of humanity than the mean ruck of men we have nowwed do best to
stay at home and hold our counfounded jaw Heres ourselves and Peer
emptied his glass

This was a sad hearing for poor Langberg For he had been used to
comfort himself in his daily round with the thought that even he in his
modest sphere was doing his share in the great work of civilising the
world

At last he leaned back watching the smoke from his cigar and smiling a
little

I remember a young fellow at the College he said who used to talk
a good deal about Prometheus and the grand work of liberating humanity
by stealing new and ever new fire from Olympus

That was meyes said Peer with a laugh As a matter of fact I was
only quoting Ferdinand Holm

You dont believe in all that now

It strikes me that fire and steel are rapidly turning men into beasts
Machinery is killing more and more of what we call the godlike in us

But good heavens man Surely a man can be a Christian even if   

Christian as much as you like But dont you think it might soon be
time we found something better to worship than an ascetic on a cross
Are we to keep on for ever singing Hallelujah because weve saved our
own skins and yet can haggle ourselves into heaven Is that religion

No no perhaps not But I dont know   

Neither do I But its all the same for anyhow no such thing as
religious feeling exists any longer Machinery is killing our longings
for eternity too Ask the good people in the great cities They spend
Christmas Eve playing tunes from The Dollar Princess on the gramophone

Langberg sat for a while watching the other attentively Peer sat
smoking slowly his face was flushed with the wine but from time to
time his eyes halfclosed and his thoughts seemed to be wandering in
other fields than these

And what do you think of doing now you are home again asked his
companion at last

Peer opened his eyes Doing Oh I dont know Look about me first of
all Then perhaps I may find a cottars croft somewhere and settle down
and marry a dairymaid Heres luck

The gardens were full now of people in light summer dress and in the
luminous evening a constant ripple of laughter and gay voices came up
to them Peer looked curiously at the crowd all strangers to him and
asked his companion the names of some of the people Langberg pointed
out one or two celebritiesa Cabinet Minister sitting near by a famous
explorer a little farther off But I dont know them personally he
added Cant afford society on that scale of course

How beautiful it is here said Peer looking out once more at the
yellow shimmer of light above the fjord And how good it is to be home
again



Chapter II


He sat in the train on his way upcountry and from the carriage window
watched farms and meadows and treelined roads slide past Where was
he going He did not know himself Why should not a man start off at
haphazard and get out when the mood takes him At last he was able to
travel through his own country without having to think of halfpennies
He could let the days pass over his head without care or trouble and
give himself good leisure to enjoy any beauty that came in his way

There is Mjosen the broad lake with the rich farmlands and long wooded
ridges on either side He had never been here before yet it seemed as
if something in him nodded a recognition to it all Once more he sat
drinking in the rich fruitful landscapethe wooded hills the fields
and meadows seemed to spread themselves out over empty places in his
mind

But later in the day the landscape narrowed and they were in
Gudbrandsdalen where the sunburned farms are set on green slopes
between the river and the mountains Peers head was full of pictures
from abroad from the desert sands with their scorched palmtrees to the
canals of Venice But herehe nodded again Here he was at home though
he had never seen the place before just this it was which had been
calling to him all through his long years of exile

At last on a sudden he gathered up his traps and got out without the
least idea even of the name of the station A meal at the hotel a
knapsack on his back and heythere before him lies the road up into
the hills

Alone What matter when there are endless things that greet him
from every side with Welcome home The road is steep the air grows
lighter the homesteads smaller At last the huts look like little
matchboxesfrom the valley no doubt it must seem as if the people up
here were living among the clouds But many and many a youth must have
followed this road in the evenings going up to court his Mari or his
Kari at the saeterhut the same road and the same errand one generation
after another To Peer it seemed as if all those lads now bore him
companyaye as if he discovered in himself something of wanton youth
that had managed to get free at last

Puh His coat must come off and his cap go into the knapsack Now
as the valley sinks and sinks farther beneath him the view across it
widens farther and farther out over the uplands beyond Brown hills and
blue ridges livid or mossygrey in the setting sun rising and falling
wave behind wave and beyond all a great snowfield like a sea of
white breakers foaming against the sky But surely he had seen all this
before

Ah now he knew it was the Lofoten Sea over againwith its white
foamcrested combers and longdrawn heavybreathing swella rolling
ocean turned to rock Peer halted a moment leaning on his stick and
his eyes halfclosed Could he not feel that same oceanswell rising
and sinking in his own being Did not the same waves surge through
the centuries carrying the generations away with them upon great
wanderings And in daily life the wave rolls us along in the old
familiar rhythm and not one in ten thousand lifts his head above it to
ask whither and why Even now just such a little wave has hold of
him taking himwhither and why Well the coming days might show
meanwhile there beyond was the sea of stone rolling its eternal cadence
under the endless sky

He wiped his forehead and turned and went his way

But what is that far off in the northeast three sisters in white
shawls lifting their heads to heaventhat must be Rondane And see how
the evening sun is kindling the white peaks to purple and gold

Puhonly one more hill now and here is the top at last And there
ahead lie the great uplands with marsh and mound and gleaming tarns
Ah what a relief What wonder that his step grows lighter and quicker
Before he knows it he is singing aloud in mere gaiety of heart Ah dear
God what if after all it were not too late to be young

A saeter A little hut standing on a patch of green with splitstick
fence and a long cowhouse of rough planksit must be a saeter And
listenisnt that a girl singing Peer slipped softly through the gate
and stood listening against the wall of the byre Shap shap shap
went the streams of milk against the pail It must be a fairy sitting
milking in there Then came the voice


 Oh Sunday eve oh Sunday eve
 Ever wast thou my dearest eve


Shap shap shap went the milk once more in the pailand suddenly
Peer joined in


 Oh bright oh gentle Sunday eve
 Wilt ever be my dearest eve


The milking stopped a cowbell tinkled as the cow turned her inquiring
face and a girls lightbrown head of hair was thrust out of the
doorwaysoon followed by the girl herself slender eighteen
redcheeked fresh and smiling

Good evening said Peer stretching out his hand

The girl looked at him for a moment then cast a glance at her own
clothesas women will when they see a man who takes their fancy

An who may you be she asked

Can you cook me some creamporridge

A must finish milking first then

Here was a job that Peer could help with He took off his knapsack
washed his hands and was soon seated on a stool in the close sweet air
of the shed milking busily Then he fetched water and chopped some
wood for the fire the girl gazing at him all the time no doubt
wondering who this crazy person could be When the porridge stood ready
on the table he insisted on her sitting down close to him and sharing
the meal They ate a little and then laughed a little and then
chatted and then ate and then laughed again When he asked what he had
to pay the girl said Whatever you likeand he gave her two crowns
and then bent her head back and kissed her lips Whats the man up to
he heard her gasp behind him as he passed out when he had gone a good
way and turned to look back there she was in the doorway shading her
eyes and watching him

Whither away now Well he was pretty sure to reach some other inhabited
place before night This he felt was not his abidingplace No it was
not here

It was nearly midnight when he stood by the shore of a broad mountain
lake beneath a snowflecked hillside Here were a couple of saeters
and across the lake on a wooded island stood a small frame house that
looked like some city peoples summer cottage And seeover the lake
that still mirrored the evening red a boat appeared moving towards the
island and two whitesleeved girls sat at the oars singing as they
rowed A strange feeling came over him Herehere he would stay

In the saeterhut stood an enormously fat woman with a rope round
her middle evidently ready to go to bed Could she put him up for the
night Why yes she supposed soand she rolled off into another room
And soon he was lying in a tiny chamber in a bed with a mountainous
mattress and a quilt There was a fresh smell from the juniper twigs
strewed about the newlywashed floor and the cheeses which stood in
rows all round the shelflined walls Ah he had slept in many places
and fashionsat sea in a Lofoten boat on the swaying back of a camel
in tents out in the moonlit desert and in palaces of the Arabian
Nights where dwarfs fanned him with palmleaves to drive away the heat
and called him pasha But here at last he had found a place where it
was good to be And he closed his eyes and lay listening to the murmur
of a little stream outside in the light summer night till he fell
asleep

Late in the forenoon of the next day he was awakened by the entry of the
old woman with coffee Then a plunge into the bluegreen water of
the mountain lake a short swim and back to find grilled trout and
newbaked waffles and thick cream for lunch

Yes said the old woman if he could get along with the sort of victuals
she could cook he might stay here a few days and welcome The bed was
standing there empty anyway



Chapter III


So Peer stays on and goes fishing He catches little but time goes
leisurely here and the summer lies soft and warm over the brown and
blue hillsides He has soon learned that a merchant named Uthoug
from Ringeby is living in the house on the island with his wife and
daughter And what of it

Often he would lie in his boat smoking his pipe and giving himself
up to quiet dreams that came and passed A young girl in a white boat
moving over red waters in the eveninga secret meeting on an islandno
one must know just yet    Would it ever happen to him Ah no

The sun goes down there come sounds of cowbells nearing the saeters
the musical cries and calls of the saetergirls the lowing of the
cattle The mountains stand silent in the distance their snowclad tops
grown golden the stream slides rippling by murmuring on through the
luminous nights

Then at last came the day of all days

He had gone out for a long tramp at random over the hills making his
way by compass and noting landmarks to guide him back Here was a marsh
covered with cloudberriesthe taste brought back his own childhood He
wandered on up a palebrown ridge flecked with red heatherand what was
that ahead Smoke He made towards it Yes it was smoke A ptarmigan
fluttered out in front of him with a brood of tiny youngsters at her
heelsLord what a shavehe stopped short to avoid treading on them
The smoke meant someone nearpossibly a camp of Lapps Lets go and
see

He topped the last mound and there was the fire just below Two girls
jumped to their feet there was a bright coffeekettle on the fire and
on the mosscovered ground close by bread and butter and sandwiches laid
out on a paper tablecloth

Peer stopped short in surprise The girls gazed at him for a moment and
he at them all three with a hesitating smile

At last Peer lifted his hat and asked the way to Rustad saeter It took
them some time to explain this and then they asked him the time He
told them exactly to the minute and then showed them his watch so that
they might see for themselves All this took more time Meanwhile they
had inspected each other and found no reason to part company just yet
One of the girls was tall slender of figure with a warmcoloured oval
face and dark brown hair Her eyebrows were thick and met above the
nose delightful to look at She wore a blue serge dress with the skirt
kilted up a little leaving her ankles visible The other was a blonde
smaller of stature and with a melancholy face though she smiled
constantly Oh she said suddenly have you a pocketknife by any
chance

Oh yes Peer was just moving off but gladly seized the opportunity to
stay a while

Weve a tin of sardines here and nothing to open it with said the
dark one

Let me try said Peer As luck would have it he managed to cut
himself a little and the two girls tumbled over each other to tie up
the wound It ended of course with their asking him to join their
coffeeparty

My name is Merle Uthoug said the dark one with a curtsy

Oh then its your father who has the place on the island in the
lake

My names only MorkThea Mork My father is a lawyer and we have a
little cottage farther up the lake said the blonde

Peer was about to introduce himself when the dark girl interrupted
Oh we know you already she said Weve seen you out rowing on the
lake so often And we had to find out who you were We have a good pair
of glasses   

Merle broke in her companion warningly

   and then yesterday we sent one of the maids over reconnoitring
to make inquiries and bring us a full report

Merle How can you say such things

It was a cheery little feast Ah how young they were these two girls
and how they laughed at a joke and what quantities of bread and butter
and coffee they all three disposed of Merle now and again would give
their companion a sidelong glance while Thea laughed at all the wild
things her friend said and scolded her and looked anxiously at Peer

And now the sun was nearing the shoulder of a hill far in the west and
evening was falling They packed up their things and Peer was loaded up
with a big bag of cloudberries on his back and a tin pail to carry in
his hand Give him some more said Merle Itll do him good to work
for a change

Merle you really are too bad

Here you are said the girl and slid the handle of a basket into his
other hand

Then they set out down the hill Merle sang and yodelled as they went
then Peer sang and then they all three sang together And when they
came to a heathertussock or a puddle they did not trouble to go round
but just jumped over it and then gave another jump for the fun of the
thing

They passed the saeter and went on down to the waters edge and Peer
proposed to row them home And so they rowed across And the whole time
they sat talking and laughing together as if they had known each other
for years

The boat touched land just below the cottage and a broadshouldered man
with a grey beard and a straw hat came down to meet them Oh father
are you back again cried Merle and springing ashore she flung her
arms round his neck The two exchanged some whispered words and the
father glanced at Peer Then taking off his hat he came towards him
and said politely It was very kind of you to help the girls down

This is Herr Holm engineer and Egyptian said Merle and this is
father

I hear we are neighbours said Uthoug Were just going to have tea
so if you have nothing better to do perhaps you will join us

Outside the cottage stood a greyhaired lady with a pale face wearing
spectacles She had a thick white woollen shawl over her shoulders but
even so she seemed to feel cold Welcome she said and Peer thought
there was a tremor in her voice

There were two small low rooms with an open fireplace in the one and in
it there stood a table ready laid But from the moment Merle entered
the house she took command of everything and whisked in and out Soon
there was the sound of fish cooking in the kitchen and a moment later
she came in with a plate full of lettuce and said Mr Egyptianyou
can make us an Arabian salad cant you

Peer was delighted I should think so he said

Youll find salt and pepper and vinegar and oil on the table there and
thats all we possess in the way of condiments But it must be a real
Arabian salad all the same if you please And out she went again
while Peer busied himself with the salad

I hope you will excuse my daughter said Fru Uthoug turning her pale
face towards him and looking through her spectacles She is not really
so wild as she seems

Uthoug himself walked up and down the room chatting to Peer and asking
a great many questions about conditions in Egypt He knew something
about the Mahdi and General Gordon and Khartoum and the strained
relations between the Khedive and the Sultan He was evidently a
diligent reader of the newspapers and Peer gathered that he was a
Radical and a man of some weight in his party And he looked as if
there was plenty of fire smouldering under his reddish eyelids A bad
man to fall out with thought Peer

They sat down to supper and Peer noticed that Fru Uthoug grew less pale
and anxious as her daughter laughed and joked and chattered There even
came a slight glow at last into the faded cheeks the eyes behind the
spectacles seemed to shine with a light borrowed from her daughters
But her husband seemed not to notice anything and tried all the time to
go on talking about the Mahdi and the Khedive and the Sultan

So for the first time for many years Peer sat down to table in a
Norwegian homeand how good it was Would he ever have a home of his
own he wondered

After the meal a mandolin was brought out and they sat round the fire
in the great fireplace and had some music Until at last Merle rose and
said Now mother its time you went to bed

Yes dear came the answer submissively and Fru Uthoug said
goodnight and Merle led her off

Peer had risen to take leave when Merle came in again Why she said
youre surely not going off before youve rowed Thea home

Oh Merle please    put in the other

But when the two had taken their places in the boat and were just about
to start up the lake Merle came running down and said she might just as
well come too

Half an hour later having seen the young girl safely ashore at her
fathers place Merle and Peer were alone rowing back through the still
night over the waters of the lake golden in the light and dark blue in
the shadows Merle leaned back in the stern silent trailing a small
branch along the surface of the water behind After a while Peer laid in
his oars and let the boat drift

How beautiful it is he said

The girl lifted her head and looked round Yes she answered and Peer
fancied her voice had taken a new tone

It was past midnight Heights and woods and saeters lay lifeless in the
soft suffused reddish light The laketrout were not rising any more
but now and again the screech of a cockptarmigan could be heard among
the withies

What made you come just here for your holiday I wonder she asked
suddenly

I leave everything to chance Froken Uthoug It just happened so Its
all so homelike here wherever one goes And it is so wonderful to be
home in Norway again

But havent you been to see your peopleyour father and mothersince
you came home

I Do you suppose I have a father and mother

But near relationssurely you must have a brother or sister somewhere
in the world

Ah if one only had Though after all one can get on without

She looked at him searchingly as if trying to see whether he spoke in
earnest Then she said

Do you know that mother dreamed of you before you came

Of me Peers eyes opened wide What did she dream about me

A sudden flush came to the girls face and she shook her head Its
foolish of me to sit here and tell you all this But you see that was
why we wanted so much to find out about you when you came And it gives
me a sort of feeling of our having known each other a long time

You appear to have a very constant flow of high spirits Froken
Uthoug

I Why do you think Oh well yes One can come by most things you
know if one has to have them

Even high spirits

She turned her head and looked towards the shore Some day perhapsif
we should come to be friendsIll tell you more about it

Peer bent to his oars and rowed on The stillness of the night drew them
nearer and nearer together and made them silent only now and then they
would look at each other and smile

What mysterious creature is this I have come upon thought Peer She
might be about oneor twoandtwenty She sat there with bowed head and
in this soft glow the oval face had a strange light of dreams upon it
But suddenly her glance came back and rested on him again and then she
smiled and he saw that her mouth was large and her lips full and red

I wish I had been all over the world like you she said

Have you never been abroad Froken Uthoug he asked

I spent a winter in Berlin once and a few months in South Germany I
played the violin a little you see and I hoped to take it up seriously
abroad and make something of itbut

Well why shouldnt you

She was silent for a little then at last she said I suppose you are
sure to know about it some day so I may just as well tell you now
Mother has been out of her mind

My dear Froken

And when shes at home myhigh spirits are needed to help her to be
more or less herself

He felt an impulse to rise and go to the girl and take her head between
his hands But she looked up with a melancholy smile their eyes met in
a long look and she forgot to withdraw her glance

I must go ashore now she said at last

Oh so soon Why we have hardly begun our talk

I must go ashore now she repeated and her voice though still
gentle was not to be gainsaid

At last Peer was alone rowing back to his saeter As he rowed he
watched the girl going slowly up towards the cottage When she reached
the door she turned for the first time and waved to him Then she
stood for a moment looking after him and then opened the door and
disappeared He gazed at the door some time longer as if expecting to
see it open again but no sign of life was to be seen

The suns rim was showing now above the distant ranges in the east and
the white peaks in the north and west kindled in the morning glow Peer
laid in his oars again and rested with his elbows on his knees and his
head in his hands What could this thing be that had befallen him today

How could those peaks stand round so aloof and indifferent and leave
him here disconsolate and alone

What was it this new rushing in his ears this new rhythm of his pulse
He lay back at last in the bottom of the boat with hands clasped behind
his head and let boat and all things drift

And when the glare of the rising sun came slanting into the boat and
beat dazzlingly in his face he only turned his head a little and let it
shine full upon him

Now she is lying asleep over there the morning streaming red through
her windowof whom is she dreaming as she sleeps

Have you ever seen such eyebrows before To press ones lips to themto
take her head between ones hand    and so it is to save your mother
that you give up your own dreams and to warm her soul that you keep
that flame of gladness burning in you Is that the sort you are

Merlewas ever such a name Are you called Merle

Day spreads over the heavens kindling all the nightclouds great and
small to gold and scarlet And here he lies rocking rocking on no
lake but on a red statelyheaving ocean swell

Ah till now your mind has been so filled with cold mechanics with
calculations with steel and fire More and more knowledge ever more
striving to understand all things to know all to master all But
meanwhile the tones of the hymn died within you and the hunger for
that which lies beyond all things grew ever fiercer and fiercer You
thought it was Norway that you neededand now you are here But is it
enough

Merleis your name Merle

There is nothing that can be likened to the first day of love All your
learning your travel and deeds and dreamsall has been nothing but
dry firewood that you have dragged and heaped together And now has come
a spark and the whole heap blazes up casting its red glow over earth
and heaven and you stretch out your cold hands and warm them and
shiver with joy that a new bliss has come upon the earth

And all that you could not understandthe relation between the spark
of eternity in your soul and the Power above and the whole of endless
spacehas all of a sudden become so clear that you lie here trembling
with joy at seeing to the very bottom of the infinite enigma

You have but to take her by the hand and Here are we two you say to
the powers of life and death Here is she and here am Iwe twoand
you send the anthem rolling alofta strain from little Louises
fiddlebow mingling with itnot to the vaultings of any church but
into endless space itself And Thou Power above now I understand Thee
How could I ever take seriously a Power that sat on high playing with
Sin and Gracebut now I see Thee not the bloodthirsty Jehovah but a
goldenhaired youth the Light itself We two worship Thee not with a
wail of prayer but with a great anthem that has the WorldAll in it
All our powers our knowledge our dreamsall are there And each
has its own instrument its own voice in the mighty chorus The dawn
reddening over the hills is with us The goat grazing on that northern
hillside dazzled with sungold when it turns its head to the eastit
is with us too The waking birds are with us A frog crawling up out
of a puddle and stopping to wonder at the morningit is there Even the
little insect with diamonds on its wingsand the grassblade with
its pearl of dew trying to mirror as much of the sky as it canit is
there it is there it is there We are standing amid Loves first day
and there is no more talk of grace or doubt or faith or need of aid
only a rushing sound of music rising to heaven from all the golden
rivers in our hearts

The saeters were beginning to wake Musical cries came echoing as the
saetergirls chid on the cattle that moved slowly up to the northern
heights with lowings and tinkling of bells But Peer lay still where
he wasand presently the dairymaid at the saeter caught sight of what
seemed an empty boat drifting on the lake and was afraid some accident
had happened

Merle thought Peer still lying motionless Is your name Merle

The dairymaid was down by the waterside now calling across toward the
boat And at last she saw a man sit up rubbing his eyes

Mercy on us she cried Lord be thanked that youre there And you
havent been in the whole blessed night

A goat with a broken leg set in splints had been left to stray at will
about the cattlepens and in and out of the house while its legbones
were setting Peer must needs pick up the creature and carry it round
for a while in his arms though it at once began chewing at his beard
When he sat down to the breakfasttable he found something so touching
in the look of the cream and butter the bread and the coffee that
it seemed a man would need a heart of stone to be willing to eat such
things And when the old woman said he really ought to get some food
into him he sprang up and embraced her as far as his arms would go
round Nice carryings on she cried struggling to free herself But
when he went so far as to imprint a sounding kiss on her forehead she
fetched him a mighty push Lord she said if the gomeril hasnt gone
clean out of his wits this last night



Chapter IV


Ringeby lay on the shore of a great lake and was one of those busy
commercial towns which have sprung up in the last fifty years from
a nucleus consisting of a sawmill and a flourmill by the side of a
waterfall Now quite a number of modern factories had spread upwards
along the river and the place was a town with some four thousand
inhabitants with a church of its own a monster of a school building
and numbers of yellow workmens dwellings scattered about at random in
every direction Otherwise Ringeby was much like any other little town
There were two lawyers who fought for scraps of legal business and the
editors of two local papers who were constantly at loggerheads before
the Conciliation Board There was a temperance lodge and Workers Union
and a chapel and a picture palace And every Sunday afternoon the good
citizens of Ringeby walked out along the fjord with their wives on
their arms On these occasions most of the men wore frock coats and grey
felt hats but Enebak the tanner being hunchbacked preferred a tall
silk hat as better suited to eke out his height

On Saturday evenings when twilight began to fall the younger men would
meet at the corner outside Hammers store to discuss the events of the
week

Have you heard the latest news asked Lovli the bank cashier of his
friend the telegraphist who came up

News Do you tell me that theres ever any news in this accursed hole

Merle Uthoug has come back from the mountainsengaged to be married

The devil she is What does the old man say to that

Oh well the old man will want an engineer if hes to get the new
timbermills into his clutches

Is the man an engineer

From Egypt A Muhammadan I daresay Brown as a coffeeberry and
rolling in money

Do you hear that Froken Bull Stop a minute heres some news for
you

The girl addressed turned aside and joined them Oh the same piece
of news thats all over the town I suppose Well I can tell you hes
most tremendously nice

Sh whispered the telegraphist Peer Holm was just coming out of the
Grand Hotel dressed in a grey suit and with a dark coat over his arm
He was trying to get a newlylit cigar to draw as he walked with a
light elastic step past the group at the corner A little farther up the
street he encountered Merle and took her arm and the two walked off
together the young people at the corner watching them as they went

And when is it to be asked the telegraphist

He wanted to be married immediately I believe said Froken Bull but
I suppose theyll have to wait till the banns are called like other
people

Lorentz D Uthougs long yellowpainted wooden house stood facing the
market square the office and the big ironmongers shop were on the
ground floor and the family lived in the upper storeys Thats
where he lives people would say Or There he goes as the broad
greybearded man passed down the street Was he such a big man then
He could hardly be called really rich though he had a sawmill and a
machineshop and a flourmill and owned a country place some way out
of the town But there was something of the chieftain something of the
prophet about him He hated priests He read deep philosophical works
forbade his family to go to church and had been visited by Bjornson
himself It was good to have him on your side to have him against you
was fatalyou might just as well clear out of the town altogether He
had a finger in everything that went on it was as if he owned the whole
town He had been known to meet a youth he had never spoken to before in
the street and accost him with a peremptory Understand me young man
you will marry that girl Yet for all this Lorentz Uthoug was not
altogether content True he was head and shoulders above all the
Ringeby folks but what he really wanted was to be the biggest man in a
place a hundred times as large

And now that he had found a soninlaw he seemed as it were to be
walking quietly round this stranger from the great world taking his
measure and asking in his thoughts Who are you at bottom What have
you seen What have you read Are you progressive or reactionary Have
you any proper respect for what I have accomplished here or are you
going about laughing in your sleeve and calling me a whale among the
minnows

Every morning when Peer woke in his room at the hotel he rubbed his
eyes On the table beside his bed stood a photograph of a young girl
What Is it really you Peer that have found someone to stand close to
you at last Someone in the world who cares about you When you have a
cold therell be people to come round and be anxious about you and ask
how you are getting on And this to happen to you

He dined at the Uthougs every day and there were always flowers beside
his plate Often there would be some little surprisea silver spoon or
fork or a napkinring with his initials on It was like gathering
the first straws to make his new nest And the pale woman with the
spectacles looked kindly at him as if to say You are taking her from
me but I forgive you

One day he was sitting in the hotel reading when Merle came in

Will you come for a walk she asked

Good idea Where shall we go today

Well we havent been to see Aunt Marit at Bruseth yet We really ought
to go you know Ill take you there today

Peer found these ceremonial visits to his new relatives quite amusing
he went round as it were collecting uncles and aunts And today there
was a new one Well why not

Butmy dear girl have you been crying he asked suddenly taking her
head in his hands

Oh its nothing Comelets go now And she thrust him gently away
as he tried to kiss her But the next moment she dropped into a chair
and sat looking thoughtfully at him through halfclosed eyes nodding
her head very slightly She seemed to be asking herself Who is this
man What is this I am taking on me A fortnight ago he was an utter
stranger

She passed her hand across her brow Its motheryou know she said

Is anything special wrong today

Shes so afraid youre going to carry me off into the wide world at a
moments notice

But Ive told her were going to live here for the present

The girl drew up one side of her mouth in a smile and her eyelids
almost closed And what about me then After living here all these
years crazy to get out into the world

And I who am crazy to stay at home said Peer with a laugh How
delicious it will be to have a house and a family at lastand peace and
quiet

But what about me

Youll be there too Ill let you live with me

Oh how stupid you are today If you only knew what it means to throw
away the best years of ones youth in a hole like this And besidesI
could have done something worth while in music

Why then lets go abroad by all means said Peer wrinkling up his
forehead as if to laugh

Oh nonsense you know its quite impossible to go off and leave mother
now But you certainly came at a very critical time For anyway I was
longing and longing just then for someone to come and carry me off

Aha so I was only a sort of ticket for the tour He stepped over and
pinched her nose

Oh youd better be careful I havent really promised yet to have you
you know

Havent promised When you practically asked me yourself

She clapped her hands together Why what shameless impudence After my
saying No No No for days together I wont I wont I wontI said
it ever so many times And you said it didnt matterfor YOU WOULD
Yes you took me most unfairly off my guard but now look out for
yourself

The next moment she flung her arms round his neck But when he tried to
kiss her she pushed him away again No she said you mustnt think
I did it for that

Soon they were walking arminarm along the country road on their way
to Aunt Marit at Bruseth It was September and all about the wooded
hills stood yellow and the cornfields were golden and the rowan berries
bloodred But there was still summer in the air

Ugh how impossibly fast you walk exclaimed Merle stopping out of
breath

And when they came to a gate they sat down in the grass by the wayside
Below them was the town with its many roofs and chimneys standing out
against the shining lake that lay framed in broad stretches of farm and
field

Do you know how it came about that mother isas she is asked Merle
suddenly

No I didnt like to ask you about it

She drew a stalk of grass between her lips

Well you seemothers father was a clergyman And whenwhen father
forbade her to go to church she obeyed him But she couldnt sleep
after that She feltas if she had sold her soul

And what did your father say to that

Said it was hysteria But hysteria or not mother couldnt sleep And
at last they had to take her away to a home

Poor soul said Peer taking the girls hand

And when she came back from there she was so changed one would hardly
have known her And father gave way a littlemore than he ever used to
doand said Well well I suppose you must go to church if you wish
but you mustnt mind if I dont go with you And so one Sunday she took
my hand and we went together but as we reached the church door and
heard the organ playing inside she turned back Noits too late
now she said Its too late Merle And she has never been since

And she has always beenstrangesince then

Merle sighed The worst of it is she sees so many evil things
compassing her about She says the only thing to do is to laugh them
away But she cant laugh herself And so I have to But when I go away
from heroh I cant bear to think of it

She hid her face against his shoulder and he began stroking her hair

Tell me Peershe looked up with her onesided smilewho is
rightmother or father

Have you been trying to puzzle that out

Yes But its so hopelessso impossible to come to any sort of
certainty What do you think Tell me what you think Peer

They sat there alone in the golden autumn day her head pressed against
his shoulder Why should he play the superior person and try to put her
off with vague phrases

Dear Merle I know of course no more than you do There was a time
when I saw God standing with a rod in one hand and a sugarcake in the
otherjust punishment and rewards to all eternity Then I thrust Him
from me because He seemed to me so unjustand at last He vanished
melting into the solar systems on high and all the infinitesimal
growths here on the earth below What was my life what were my dreams
my joy or sorrow to these Where was I making for Ever and always
there was something in me saying He IS But where Somewhere beyond and
behind the things you knowit is there He is And so I determined
to know more things more and more and moreand what wiser was I A
steamhammer crushes my skull one dayand what has become of my part in
progress and culture and science Am I as much of an accident as a fly
on an ant Do I mean no more Do I vanish and leave as little trace
Answer me that little Merlewhat do YOU think

The girl sat motionless breathing softly with closed eyes Then she
began to smileand her lips were full and red and at last they shaped
themselves to a kiss


Bruseth was a large farm lying high above the town with its garden and
avenues and long verandahs round the white dwellinghouse And what a
view out over the lake and the country far around The two stood for a
moment at the gate looking back

Merles aunther fathers sisterwas a widow rich and a notable
manager but capricious to a degree capable of being generous one day
and grasping the next It was the sorrow of her life that she had no
children of her own but she had not yet decided who was to be her heir

She came sailing into the room where the two young people were waiting
and Peer saw her coming towards them a tall fullbosomed woman
with grey hair and florid colour Oho heres an aunt for you with a
vengeance he thought She pulled off a blue apron she was wearing and
appeared dressed in a black woollen gown with a gold chain about her
neck and long gold earrings

So you thought youd come over at last she said Actually remembered
my existence after all did you Merle She turned towards Peer and
stood examining him with her hands on her hips So thats what you
look like is it Peer And youre the man that was to catch Merle
Well you see I call you Peer at once even though you HAVE come all the
way fromArabia is it Sit down sit down

Wine was brought in and Aunt Marit of Bruseth lifted a congratulatory
glass toward the pair with the following words

Youll fight of course But dont overdo it thats all And mark my
words Peer Holm if you arent good to her Ill come round one fine
day and warm your ears for you Your healths children

The two went homewards arminarm dancing down the hillsides and
singing gaily as they went But suddenly when they were still some
way from the town Merle stopped and pointed There she
whisperedtheres mother

A solitary woman was walking slowly in the twilight over a wide field
of stubble looking around her It was as if she were lingering here to
search out the meaning of somethingof many things From time to time
she would glance up at the sky or at the town below or at people
passing on the road and then she would nod her head How infinitely far
off she seemed how utterly a stranger to all the noisy doings of men
What was she seeing now What were her thoughts

Let us go on whispered Merle drawing him with her And the young
girl suddenly began to sing loudly as if in an overflow of spirits
and Peer guessed that it was for her mothers sake Perhaps the lonely
woman stood there now in the twilight smiling after them


One Sunday morning Merle drove up to the hotel in a light cart with a
big brown horse Peer came out and climbed in leaving the reins to her
They were going out along the fjord to look at her fathers big estate
which in olden days had been the County Governors official residence

It is the end of September The sun is still warm but the waters of the
lake are grey and all the fields are reaped Here and there a strip of
yellowing potatostalks lies waiting to be dug up Up on the hillsides
horses tethered for grazing stand nodding their heads slowly as if they
knew that it was Sunday And a faint mist left by the damps of the night
floats about here and there over the broad landscape

They passed through a wood and came on the other side to an avenue
of old ash trees that turned up from the road and ran uphill to a big
house where a flag was flying The great white dwellinghouse stood
high as if to look out far over the world the red farmbuildings
enclosed the wide courtyard on three sides and below were gardens and
broad lands sloping down towards the lake Something like an estate

Whats the name of that place cried Peer gazing at it

Loreng

And who owns it

Dont know answered the girl cracking her whip

Next moment the horse turned in to the avenue and Peer caught
involuntarily at the reins Hei Browniewhere are you going he
cried

Why not go up and have a look said Merle

But we were going out to look at your fathers place

Well that is fathers place

Peer stared at her face and let go the reins What What You dont
mean to say your father owns that place there

A few minutes later they were strolling through the great lowceiled
rooms The whole house was empty now the farmbailiff living in the
servants quarters Peer grew more and more enthusiastic Here in these
great rooms there had been festive gatherings enough in the days of the
old Governors where cavaliers in uniform or with elegant shirtfrills
and golden spurs had kissed the hands of ladies in sweeping silk robes
Old mahogany potpourri convivial song wit gracePeer saw it all in
his minds eye and again and again he had to give vent to his feelings
by seizing Merle and embracing her

Oh but look here Merleyou know this is a fairytale

They passed out into the old neglected garden with its grassgrown paths
and wellfilled carpponds and tumbledown pavilions Peer rushed about
it in all directions Here too there had been fetes with coloured
lamps festooned around and couples whispering in the shade of every
bush Merle did you say your father was going to sell all this to the
State

Yes thats what it will come to I expect she answered The place
doesnt pay he says when he cant live here himself to look after it

But what use can the State make of it

Oh a Home for Imbeciles I believe

Good Lord I might have guessed it An idiot asylumto be sure He
tramped about fairly jumping with excitement Merle look herewill
you come and live here

She threw back her head and looked at him I ask you Merle Will you
come and live here

Do you want me to answer this moment on the spot

Yes For I want to buy it this moment on the spot

Well arent you

Look Merle just look at it all That long balcony there with the
doric columnsnothing shoddy about thatits the real thing Empire I
know something about it

But itll cost a great deal Peer There was some reluctance in her
voice Was she thinking of her violin Was she loth to take root too
firmly

A great deal he said What did your father give for it

The place was sold by auction and he got it cheap Fifty thousand
crowns I think it was

Peer strode off towards the house again Well buy it Its the
very place to make into a home    Horses cattle sheep goats
cottarsah itll be grand

Merle followed him more slowly But Peer remember youve just taken
over fathers machineshops in town

Pooh said Peer scornfully Do you think I cant manage to run that
village smithy and live here too Come along Merle And he took her
hand and drew her into the house again

It was useless to try to resist He dragged her from room to room
furnishing as he went along This room here is the diningroomand
thats the big receptionroom this will be the studythats a boudoir
for you    Come now tomorrow well go into Christiania and buy the
furniture

Merle gasped for breath He had got so far by this time that the
furnishing was complete and they were installed They had a governess
already and he was giving parties too Here was the ballroom He
slipped an arm round her waist and danced round the room with her till
she was carried away by his enthusiasm and stood flushed and beaming
while all she had dreamed of finding some day out in the wide world
seemed suddenly to unfold around her here in these empty rooms Was this
really to be her home She stopped to take breath and to look around
her

Late that evening Peer sat at the hotel with a notebook working the
thing out He had bought Loreng his fatherinlaw had been reasonable
and had let him have the place lands and woods and all for the
ridiculous price he had paid himself There was a mortgage of thirty
thousand crowns on the estate Well that might stand as it was for the
bulk of Peers money was tied up in Ferdinand Holms company

A few days after he carried Merle off to the capital leaving the
carpenters and painters hard at work at Loreng

One day he was sitting alone at the hotel in ChristianiaMerle was out
shoppingwhen there was a very discreet knock at the door

Come in called Peer And in walked a middlesized man of thirty or
more dressed in a black frockcoat with a largepatterned vest and his
dark hair carefully combed over a bald patch on the crown He had a
red cheery face his eyes were of the brightest blue and the whole man
breathed and shone with good humour

I am Uthoug junior said the newcomer with a bow and a laugh

Ohthats capital

Just come across from Manchesterbeastly voyage Thanks thanksIll
find a seat He sat down and flung one striped trouserleg over the
other

Peer sent for some wine and in half an hour the two were firm allies
Uthoug juniors lifestory to date was quickly told He had run away
from home because his father had refused to let him go on the stagehad
found on trial that in these days there werent enough theatres to go
roundthen had set up in business for himself and now had a general
agency for the sale of English tweeds Freedom freedom was his idea
lots of elbowroomroom to turn about inwithout with your leave or
by your leave to father or anyone Your health


A week later the street outside Lorentz D Uthougs house in Ringeby was
densely crowded with people all gazing up at the long rows of lighted
windows There was feasting tonight in the great mans house About
midnight a carriage drove up to the door Thats the bridegrooms
whispered a bystander He got those horses from Denmark

The street door opened and a white figure thickly cloaked appeared
on the steps The bride whispered the crowd Then a slender man in
a dark overcoat and silk hat The bridegroom And as the pair passed
out Hiphiphip went the voice of the general agent for English
tweeds and the hurrahs came with a will

The carriage moved off and Peer sat with his arm round his bride
driving his horses at a sharp trot out along the fjord Out towards his
home towards his palace towards a new and untried future



Chapter V


A little shaggy greybearded old man stood chopping and sawing in
the woodshed at Loreng He had been there longer than anyone could
remember One master left another took his placewhat was that to
the little man Didnt the one need firewoodand didnt the other need
firewood just the same In the evening he crept up to his den in the
loft of the servants wing at mealtimes he sat himself down in the
last seat at the kitchentable and it seemed to him that there was
always food to be had Nowadays the masters name was Holman engineer
he wasand the little man blinked at him with his eyes and went on
chopping in the shed If they came and told him he was not wanted and
must gowhy thank heaven he was stone deaf as everyone knew Thud
thud went his axe in the shed and the others about the place were so
used to it that they heeded it no more than the ticking of a clock upon
the wall

In the kitchen of the big house two girls stood by the window peeping
out into the garden and giggling

There he is again said Laura Sh dont laugh so loud There now
hes stopping again

Hes whistling to a bird said Oliana Or talking to himself perhaps
Do you think hes quite right in his head

Sh The mistressll hear

It was no less a person than the master of Loreng himself whose
proceedings struck them as so comic

Peer it was wandering about in the great neglected garden with his
hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers and his cap on the back of
his head stopping here and there and moving on again as the fancy
took him Sometimes he would hum a snatch of a song and again fall
to whistling here he would pick up a twig and look at it or again
it might be a bird or perhaps an old neglected appletree that seemed
worth stopping to talk to The best of it was that these were his own
lands and his own woods that lay there in the rusty October sunshine
Was all that nothing And the hill over on the farther shore standing
on its head in the dark lakemirror clothed in a whole world of
colouryellow leaves and green leaves and light red and dark red and
golden and bloodred patches with the dark green of the pines between
His eyes had all this to rest on Did he really live here What abundant
fruitfulness all around him What a sky so wide so golden that it
seemed to ring again The potatostalks lay uprooted scattered on the
fields the corn was safely housed And here he stood He seemed again
to be drawing in nourishment from all he saw drinking it greedily
The empty places in his mind were filled the sight of the rich soft
landscape worked on his being giving it something of its own abundant
fruitfulness its own wide repose

Andwhat next

What next he mimicked in his thoughts and started again tramping up
and down the garden paths What nextwhat next Could he not afford
now to take his timeto rest a little Every man must have an end in
viewmust strive to reach this goal or that And what was his object
now What was it he had so toiled for from those hard years in the
loft above the stable even until now What was it Often it seemed as if
everything were going smoothly going of itself as if one day surely
he would find his part in a great happy worldharmony But had he not
already found it What more would he have Of course he had found it

But is this all then What is there behind and beyond Hush have done
with questioning Look at the beauty around you Here is peace peace
and rest

He hurried up to the house and init might help matters if he could
take his wife in his arms perhaps get her to come out with him a while

Merle was in the pantry with a big apron on ranging jars of preserves
on the shelves

Here dearest little wife cried Peer throwing his arms about her
what do you say to a little run

Now Do you suppose a housewife has nothing better to do than gad
about Uf my hair youll make it come down

Peer took her arm and led her over to a window looking out on the lake
There dearest Isnt it lovely here

Peer youve asked me that twenty times a day ever since we came

Yes and you never answer And youve never once yet run and thrown
your arms round my neck and said how happy you were And its never yet
come to pass that youve given me a single kiss of your own accord

I should think not when you steal such a lot And she pushed him
aside and slipped under his arm and ran out of the room I must go in
and see mother again today she said as she went

Huit Of course He paced up and down the room his step growing
more and more impatient In to motherin to mother Always and
everlastingly mother and mother and nothing else Huit and he began to
whistle

Merle put her head in at the door Peerhave you such a terrible lot
of spare time

Well yes and no Im busy enough looking about in every corner here
for something or another But I cant find it and I dont even know
exactly what it is Oh well yesI have plenty of time to spare

But what about the farm

Well theres the dairywoman in the cowhouse and the groom in the
stables and the bailiff to worry the tenants and workpeople What am I
to dopoke around making improvements

But what about the machineshop

Dont I go in twice a daycycle over to see how things are going But
with Rode for managerthat excellent and highprincipled engineer

Surely you could help him in some way

Hes got to go on running along the line of rails hes used tonothing
else for it my darling And four or five thousand crowns a year net
profitwhy its magnificent

But couldnt you extend the business

He raised his eyebrows and his mouth pursed itself up

Extenddid you say extend Extend aa dolls house

Oh Peer you shouldnt laugh at ita thing that father took so much
pains to set going

And YOU shouldnt go worrying me to get to work again in earnest
Merle You shouldnt really One of these days I might discover that
theres no way to be happy in the world but to drag a plough and look
straight ahead and forget that theres anything else in existence It
may come to that one daybut give me a little breathingspace first
and you love me Well goodbye for a while

Merle busying herself again in her pantry glanced out of the window
and saw him disappear into the stables At first she had gone with
him when he wandered about like this touching and feeling all his
possessions In the cattlestalls it might be stroking and patting
getting himself covered with hairs and chattering away in childish
glee Look Merlethis cow is mine child Dagros her name isand
shes mine We have forty of themand theyre all mine And that nag
therewhat a sight he is We have eight of them Theyre mine Yours
too of course But you dont care a bit about it You havent even
hugged any of them yet But when a mans been as poor as Ive beenand
suddenly wakened up one day and found he owned all thisNo wait a
minute Merlecome and kiss old Brownie She knew the ritual nowhe
could go over it all again and again and each time with the same happy
wonder Was it odious of her that she was beginning to find it a little
comic And how did it come about that often when she might be filled
with the deepest longing for him and he burst in upon her boisterously
hungry for her caresses she would grow suddenly cold and put him
aside What was the matter Why did she behave like this

Perhaps it was because he was so much the stronger so overwhelming in
his effect on her that she had to keep a tight hold on herself to avoid
being swept clean away and losing her identity At one moment they might
be sitting in the lamplight chatting easily together and so near in
heart and mind and the next it would be overhe would suddenly have
started up and be pacing up and down the room delivering a sort of
lecture Merleisnt it marvellous the spiritual life of plants And
then would come a torrent of talk about strange plantgrowths in
the north and in the south plants whose names she had never even
heardtheir struggle for existence their loves and longings their
heroism in disease the divine marvel of their death Their inventions
their wisdom aye their religious senseis it not marvellous Merle
From this it was only a step to the earths strata fossils crystalsa
fresh lecture And finally he would sum up the whole into one great
harmony of development from the primary celllife to the laws of
gravitation that rule the courses of the stars Was it not marvellous
One common rhythm beating through the universea symphony of
worldsAnd then he must have a kiss

But she could only draw back and put him gently aside It was as if he
came with all his storedup knowledgehis lore of plants and fossils
crystals and starsand poured it all out in a caress She could almost
have cried out for help And after hurrying her through the wonders
of the universe in this fashion he would suddenly catch her up in his
arms and whirl her off in a passionate intoxication of the senses till
she woke at last like a castaway on an island hardly knowing where or
what she was She laughed but she could have found it in her heart to
weep Could this be love In this strong man whose life till now had
been all study and work the storedup feeling burst vehemently forth
now that it had found an outlet But why did it leave her so cold

When Peer came in from the stables humming a tune he found her in the
sittingroom dressed in a dark woollen dress with a red ribbon round
her throat

He stopped short By Jovehow that suits you Merle

She let her eyes linger on him for a moment and then came up and threw
her arms round his neck

Did he have to go to the stables all alone today

Yes Ive been having a chat with the young colt

Am I unkind to you Peer

Youyou

Not even if I ask you to drive me in to see mother

Why thats the very thing The new horse I bought yesterday from
Captain Myhre should be here any minuteIm just waiting for it

A new horseto ride

Yes Hang itI must get some riding I had to handle Arab horses for
years But well try this one in the gig first

Merle was still standing with her arms round his neck and now she
pressed her warm rich lips to his close and closer It was at
such moments that she loved himwhen he stood trembling with a joy
unexpected that took him unawares She too trembled with a blissful
thrill through soul and body for once and at last it was she who gave

Ah he breathed at last pale with emotion IId be glad to die
like that

A little later they stood on the balcony looking over the courtyard
when a bearded farmhand came up with a big lightmaned chestnut horse
prancing in a halter The beast stood still in the middle of the yard
flung up its head and neighed and the horses in the stable neighed in
answer

Oh what a beauty exclaimed Merle clapping her hands

Put him into the gig called Peer to the stableboy who had come out
to take the horse

The man touched his cap Horse has never been driven before sir I was
to say

Everything must have a beginning said Peer

Merle glanced at him But they were both dressed to go out when the
chestnut came dancing up before the door with the gig The white hoofs
pawed impatiently the head was high in the air and the eyes flashed
firehe wasnt used to having shafts pressing on his sides and wheels
rumbling just behind him Peer lit a cigar

Youre not going to smoke Merle burst out

Just to show him Im not excited said Peer No sooner had they taken
their seats in the gig than the beast began to snort and rear but
the long lash flicked out over its neck and a minute later they were
tearing off in a cloud of dust towards the town


Winter cameand a real winter it was Peer moved about from one window
to another calling all the time to Merle to come and look He had
been away so longthe winter of Eastern Norway was all new to him
Looklook A world of whitea frozen white tranquillitywoods
plains lakes all in white a fairytale in sunlight a dreamland at
night under the great bright moon There was a ringing of sleighbells
out on the lake and up in the snowpowdered forest the frost stood
thick on the horses manes and the mens beards were hung with icicles
And in the middle of the night loud reports of splitting ice would come
from the lakesounds to make one sit up in bed with a start

Drivings worth while in weather like thiscome Merle The new
stallion from Gudbrandsdal wants breaking inwell take him Hallo and
away they go in their furs swinging out over the frozen lake whirling
on to the bare glassy ice where they skid and come near capsizing
and Merle screamsbut they get on to snow and hoofs and runners grip
again None of your gallopingtrot now trot And Peer cracks his whip
The black longmaned Gudbrandsdaler lifts his head and trots out And
the evening comes and under the wide and starry sky they dash up again
to LorengLoreng that lies there lighting them home with its long rows
of glowing windows A glorious day wife

Or they would go out on ski over the hills to the woodmens huts in the
forest and make a blazing fire in the big chimney and drink steaming
coffee Then home again through one of those pale winter evenings with
a violet twilight over woods and fields and lake over white snow and
blue Far away on the brown hillside in the west stands a farmhouse
with all its windows flaming with the reflection from a golden cloud
Here they come rushing the wind of their passing shaking the snow from
the pines on on over deeprutted woodcutters roads over stumps and
stonesfalling bruising themselves burying their faces deep in
the snow but dragging themselves up again smiling to each other and
rushing on again Then reaching home red and dripping they lean the
ski up against the wall and stamp the snow off their boots

Merle said Peer picking the ice from his beard we must have a
bottle of Burgundy at dinner tonight

Yesand shall we ring up and ask someone to come over

Someonefrom outside Cant we two have a little jollification all to
ourselves

Yes yes of course if you like

A showerbatha change of underclotheshow delicious Andan idea
Hell appear at dinner in evening dress just for a surprise But as
he entered the room he stopped short For there stood Merle herself in
evening dressa dress of dark red velvet with his locket round her
neck and the big plaits of hair rolled into a generous knot low on her
neck Flowers on the tablethe wine set to warmthe finest glass the
best silverptarmiganhow splendid They lift their glasses filled
with the red wine and drink to each other

The frozen winter landscape still lingered in their thoughts but the
sun had warmed their souls they laughed and jested held each others
hands long and sat smiling at each other in long silences

A glorious day today Merle And tomorrow we die

What do you saytomorrow

Or fifty years hence It comes to the same thing He pressed her hand
and his eyes half closed

But this evening were togetherand what could we want more

Then he fell to talking of his Egyptian experiences He had once spent
a months holiday in visiting ruined cities with Maspero the great
Maspero himself going with him to Luxor to Karnak with its great
avenues of sphinxes to El Amarna and Shubra They had looked on ancient
cities of temples and kings mausoleums where men thousands of years
dead lay as if lost in thought with eyes wide open ready at any moment
to rise and call out Slave is the bath ready There in the middle of
a cornfield rises an obelisk You ask what it isit is all that is left
of a royal city There too a hundred thousand years ago maybe young
couples have sat together drinking to each other in wine revelling in
all the delights of loveand where are they now Aye where are they
can you tell me

When that journey was over Merle I began to think that it was not
mere slime of the Nile that fertilised the fields it was the mouldered
bodies of the dead I rode over dust that had been human fingers lips
that had clung in kisses Millions and millions of men and women have
lived on those riverbanks and what has become of them now Geology
And I thought of the millions of prayers wailed out there to the sun and
stars to stone idols in the temples to crocodiles and snakes and the
river itself the sacred river And the air Merlethe air received
them and vibrated for a secondand that was all And even so our
prayers go up to this very day We press our warm lips to a cold stone
and think to leave an impression Skaal

But Merle did not touch her glass she sat still with her eyes on the
yellow lampshade She had not yet given up all her dreams of going forth
and conquering the world with her musicand he sat there rolling out
eternity itself before her while he and she herself her parents all
all became as chaff blown before the wind and vanished

What wont you drink with me Well wellthen I must pledge you by
myself Skaal

And being well started on his travellers tales he went on with them
but now in a more cheerful vein so that she found it possible to smile
He told of the great lakeswamps with their legions of birds ibis
pelicans swans flamingos herons and storksa world of long beaks
and curved breasts and stiltlike legs and shrieking and beating of
wings Most wonderful of all it was to stand and watch and be left
behind when the birds of passage flew northward in their thousands in
the spring My love to Norway he would say as they passed And in the
autumn to see them return grey goose starling wagtail and all the
rest How goes it now at home he would thinkand Next time Ill go
with you he would promise himself year after year

And here I am at last Skaal

Welcome home said Merle lifting her glass with a smile

He rang the bell What do you want her eyes asked

Champagne said Peer to the maid who appeared and vanished again

Are you crazy Peer

He leaned back flushed and in happy mood lit a cigarette and told of
his greatest triumph out there it was after he had finished his work at
the cataracts and had started again with a branch of the English
firm in Alexandria One morning in walked the Chief and said Now
gentlemen heres a chance for a man that has the stuff in him to win
his spurswhos ready And half a score of voices answered I Well
heres the King of Abyssinia suddenly finds he must be in the fashion
and have a railwaycouple of hundred miles of itwhat do you say to
that Splendid we cried in chorus Well but weve got to compete
with Germans and Swiss and Americansand weve got to win Of
coursea louder chorus still Now Im going to take two men and give
them a free hand Theyll go up there and survey and lay out lines and
work out the whole project thoroughly both from the technical and
the financial sideand a project thats better and cheaper than the
opposition ones Eight months work for a good man but I must have it
done in four Take along assistants and equipmentall you needand a
thousand pounds premium to the man who puts it through so that we get
the job

Peerwere you sent Merle half rose from her seat in her excitement

Iand one other

Who was that

His name was Ferdinand Holm

Merle smiled her onesided smile and looked at him through her
long lashes She knew it had been the dream of his life to beat that
halfbrother of his in fair fight And now

And what came of it she asked with a seeming careless glance at the
lamp

Peer flung away his cigarette First an expedition up the Nile then
a caravan journey camels and mules and assistants and provisions and
instruments and tents and quinineheaps of quinine Have you any
idea I wonder what a job like that means The line was to run through
forests and tunnels over swamps and torrents and chasms and everything
had to be planned and estimated at top speedmaterial labour time
cost and all It was all very well to provide for the proper spans and
girders for a viaduct and estimate for thoroughly sound work in casting
and erectingbut even then it would be no good if the Germans could
come along and say their bridge looked handsomer than ours It was a
job that would take a good man eight months and I had to get it done
in four There are just twelve hours in a day its truebut then
there are twelve more hours in the night Fever Well yes And
sunstrokeyes both men and beasts went down with that Maps got washed
out by the rain I lost my best assistant by snakebite But such things
didnt count as hindrances they couldnt be allowed to delay the work
If I lost a man it simply meant so much more work for me After a
couple of months a blacksmiths hammer started thumping in the back
of my head and when I closed my eyes for a couple of hours at night
little fiery snakes went wriggling about in my brain Tired out When
I looked in the glass my eyes were just two red balls in my head But
when the four months were up I was back in the Chiefs office

Andand Ferdinand Holm

Had got in the day before

Merle shifted a little in her seat And sohe won

Peer lit another cigarette No he saidthe cigarette seemed to draw
rather badlyI won And thats how I came to be building railways in
Abyssinia

Heres the champagne said Merle And as the wine foamed in the
glasses she rose and drank to him She said nothing only looked at him
with eyes half veiled and smiled But a wave of fire went through him
from head to foot

I feel like playing tonight she said

It was rarely that she played though he had often begged her to Since
they had been married she had seemed loth to touch her violin feeling
perhaps some vague fear that it would disturb her peace and awaken old
longings

Peer sat on the sofa leaning forward with his head in his hands
listening And there she stood at the musicstand in her red dress
flushed and warm and shining in the yellow lamplight playing

Then suddenly the thought of her mother came to her and she went to the
telephone Motherare you there mother Oh weve had such a glorious
day And the girl ran on as if trying to light up her mothers heart
with some rays of the happiness her own happy day had brought her

A little later Peer lay in bed while Merle flitted about the room
lingering over her toilet

He watched her as she stood in her long white gown before the
toilettable with the little greenshaded lamps doing her hair for the
night in a long plait Neither of them spoke He could see her face
in the glass and saw that her eyes were watching him with a soft
mysterious glancethe scent of her hair seemed to fill the place with
youth

She turned round towards him and smiled And he lay still beckoning her
towards him with shining eyes All that had passed that eveningtheir
outing and the homeward journey in the violet dusk their little feast
and his story the wineall had turned to love in their hearts and
shone out now in their smile

It may be that some touch of the cold breath of the eternities was still
in their minds the remembrance of the millions on millions that die
the flight of the aeons towards endless darkness yet in spite of all
the minutes now to come their warm embrace held a whole world of
bliss that outweighed all and made Peer as he lay there long to
send out a hymn of praise into the universe because it was so wonderful
to live

He began to understand why she lingered and took so long It was a sign
that she wanted to surprise him that her heart was kind And her light
breathing seemed even now to fill the room with love

Outside in the night the lakeice splitting into new crevices sent up
loud reports and the winter sky above the roof that sheltered them was
lit with all its stars



Chapter VI


For the next few years Peer managed his estate and his workshop without
giving too much of his time to either He had his bailiff and his
worksmanager and the work went on well enough in its accustomed
grooves If anyone had asked him what he actually did himself all the
time he would have found it hard to answer He seemed to be going
round gathering up something not clearly defined There was something
wantingsomething missed that now had to be made good It was not
knowledge now but lifelife in his native land the life of youth
that he reached out to grasp The youth in him that had never had free
play in the years of early manhood lay still dammed up and had to find
an outlet

There were festive gatherings at Loreng Long rows of sleighs drove in
the winter evenings up from the town and back again Tables were spread
and decked with glass and flowers the rooms were brightly lit and
the wine was good And sometimes in the long moonlit nights respectable
citizens would be awakened by noisy mirth in the streets of the little
town and going to the window in their nightshirts would see sleighs
come galloping down with a jangle of bells full of laughing singing
young people returning from some excursion far up in the hills where
there had been feasting and dancing Here a young lawyernewly married
and something of a privileged buffoonwas sitting on the lap of
somebody elses wife playing a concertina and singing at the top of
his voice Some of that Loreng mans doings again people would say
The place has never been the same since he came here And they would
get back to bed again shaking their heads and wondering what things
were coming to

Peer drove out too on occasion to parties at the big country houses
round where they would play cards all night and have champagne sent
up to their rooms next morning the hosts being men who knew how to
do things in style This was glorious Not mathematics or religion any
morewhat he needed now was to assimilate something of the country
life of his native land He was not going to be a stranger in his own
country He wanted to take firm root and be able to feel like others
that he had a spot in the world where he was at home

Then came the sunny day in June when he stood by Merles bed and she
lay there smiling faintly her onesided smile with a newborn girl on
her arm

What are we to call her Peer

Why we settled that long ago After your mother of course

Of course her names to be Louise said Merle turning the tiny red
face towards her breast

This came as a fresh surprise She had been planning it for weeks
perhaps and now it took him unawares like one of her spontaneous
caresses but this time a caress to his inmost soul

He made a faint attempt at a joke Oh well I never have any say in
my own house I suppose you must have it your own way He stroked her
forehead and when she saw how deeply moved he was she smiled up at him
with her most radiant smile

On one of the first days of the hayharvest Peer lay out on a sunny
hillside with his head resting on a haycock watching his people at
work The mowing machine was buzzing down by the lake the spreader at
work on the hillslopes the horses straining in front the men sitting
behind driving The whole landscape lay around him breathing summer and
fruitfulness And he himself lay there sunk in his own restful quiet

A woman in a light dress and a yellow straw hat came down the field
road pushing a childs cart before her It was Merle and Merle was
looking round her and humming as she came Since the birth of her child
her mind was at peace it was clear that she was scarcely dreaming now
of conquering the world with her musicthere was a tiny being in the
little cart that claimed all her dreams Never before had her skin
been so dazzling her smile so red it was as if her youth now first
blossomed out in all its fullness her eyes seemed opened wide in a dear
surprise

After a while Peer went down and drove the mowing machine himself He
felt as if he must get to work somehow or other to provide for his wife
and child

But suddenly he stopped got down and began to walk round the machine
and examine it closely His face was all alert now his eyes keen and
piercing He stared at the mechanism of the blades and stood awhile
thinking

What was this A happy idea was beginning to work in his mind Vague
only as yetthere was still time to thrust it aside Should he


Warm mild days and luminous nights Sometimes he could not sleep for
thinking how delicious it was to lie awake and see the sun come up

On one such night he got up and dressed A few minutes later there was
a trampling of hoofs in the stableyard and the chestnut stallion
appeared with Peer leading him He swung himself into the saddle and
trotted off down the road a white figure in his drill suit and cork
helmet

Where was he going Nowhere It was a change to be up at an unusual
hour and see the day break on a July morning

He trotted along at an easy pace rising lightly in the stirrups and
enjoying the pleasant warmth the rider feels All was quiet around him
the homesteads still asleep The sky was a pearly white with here and
there a few golden clouds reflected in the lake below And the broad
meadows still spread their manycoloured flowercarpet abroad there was
a scent in the air of leaf and meadowgrass and pine he drew in deep
breaths of it and could have sung aloud

He turned into the byroad up the hill dismounting now and again to
open a gate past farms and little cottages ever higher and higher
till at last he reached the topmost ridge and halted in a clearing The
chestnut threw up his head and sniffed the air horse and rider were
wet with the dewdrip from the trees that were now just flushing in the
first glow of the coming sun Far below was the lake reflecting sky
and hills and farmsteads all asleep And there in the east were the red
flamesthe sunthe day

The horse pawed impatiently at the ground eager to go on but Peer
held him back He sat there gazing under the brim of his helmet at the
sunrise and felt a wave of strange feeling passing through his mind

It seemed to him impossible that he should ever reach a higher pitch of
sheer delight in life He was still young and strong all the organs of
his body worked together in happy harmony No cares to weigh upon his
mind no crushing responsibilities the future lying calm and clear in
the light of day free from dizzy dreams His hunger after knowledge
was appeased he felt that what he had learned and seen and gathered was
beginning to take living organic form in his mind

But thenwhat then

The great human type of which you dreamedhave you succeeded in giving
it life in yourself

You know what is common knowledge about the progress of humanity its
struggle towards higher forms its gropings up by many ways toward the
infinite which it calls God

You know something of the life of plants the nest of a bird is a
mystery before which you could kneel in worship A rock shows you the
marks of a glacier that scraped over it thousands of years ago and
looking on it you have a glimpse of the gigantic workings of the solar
system And on autumn evenings you look up at the stars and the light
and the death and the dizzy abysses of space above you send a solemn
thrill through your soul

And this has become a part of yourself The joy of life for you is to
grasp all you can compass of the universe and let it permeate your
thought and sense on every side

But what then Is this enough Is it enough to rest thus in yourself

Have you as yet raised one steppingstone upon which other men can climb
and say Now we can see farther than before

What is your inner being worth unless it be mirrored in action

If the world one day came to be peopled with none but supermenwhat
profit in that as long as they must die

What is your faith

Ah this sense of exile of religious homelessness How many times have
you and Merle lain clasping each others hands your thoughts wandering
together hand in hand seeking over earth or among the stars for some
being to whom you might send up a prayer no slavish begging cry for
grace and favour but a jubilant thanksgiving for the gift of life

But where was He

He is not And yetHe is

But the ascetic on the cross is a God for the sick and aged What of us
others When shall the modern man strong scientifically schooled find
a temple for the sacred music the anthem of eternity in his soul

The sun rose up from behind a distant hillcrest scattering gold
over the million spires of the pineforest Peer bent forward with
redgleaming dewdrops on his hand and his white sleeve and patted the
neck of his restless beast

It was two oclock The fires of morning were lit in the clouds and in
all the waters over the earth The dew in the meadows and the pearls on
the wings of butterflies began to glisten

Now then Bijounow for home

And he dashed off down the grassgrown forest paths the chestnut
snorting as he galloped



Chapter VII


Hei Merle Were going to have distinguished visitorswhere in the
world have you got to Peer hurried through the rooms with an open
telegram in his hand and at last came upon his wife in the nursery
Oh is it here you are

Yesbut you shout so I could hear you all through the house Who is
it thats coming

Ferdinand Holm and Klaus Brock Coming to the christening after all
Great Caesarwhat do you say to that Merle

Merle was pale and her cheeks a little sunken Two years more had
passed and she had her second child now on her kneea little boy with
big wondering eyes

How fine for you Peer she said and went on undressing the child

Yes but isnt it splendid of them to set off and come all that way
just because I asked them By Jove we must look sharp and get the place
smartened up a bit

And sure enough the whole place was soon turned upsidedowncartloads
of sand coming in for the garden walks and the courtyard and painters
hard at work repainting the houses And poor Merle knew very well that
there would be serious trouble if anything should be amiss with the
entertainment indoors

At last came the hot August day when the flags were hoisted in honour of
the expected guests Once more the hum of mowing machines and hayrakes
came from the hillslopes and the air was so still that the columns of
smoke from the chimneys of the town rose straight into the air Peer
had risen early to have a last look round inspecting everything
critically from the summer dress Merle was to wear down to the horses
in the stable groomed till their coats shone again Merle understood
He had been a fisherboy beside the welldressed son of the doctor and
something meaner yet in relation to the distinguished Holm family And
there was still so much of the boy in him that he wanted to show now at
his very best

A crowd of inquisitive idlers had gathered down on the steamboat landing
when the boat swung in and lay by the pier The pair of bays in the
Loreng carriage stood tossing their heads and twitching and stamping as
the flies tormented them but at last they got their passengers and were
given their heads setting off with a wild bound or two that scattered
those who had pressed too near But in the carriage they could see the
two strangers and the engineer all three laughing and gesticulating
and talking all at once And in a few moments they vanished in a cloud
of dust whirling away beside the calm waters of the fjord

Some way behind them a cart followed driven by one of the stableboys
from Loreng and loaded with big brassbound leather trunks and a
huge chest apparently of wood but evidently containing something
frightfully heavy

Merle had finished dressing and stood looking at herself in the glass
The light summer dress was pretty she thought and the red bows at neck
and waist sat to her satisfaction Then came the roll of wheels outside
and she went out to receive her guests

Here they are cried Peer jumping down This is Ferdinand Pasha
GovernorGeneral of the new Kingdom of Saharaand this is His Highness
the Khedives chief pipecleaner and bodyeunuch

A tall stooping man with white hair and a cleanshaven driedup face
advanced towards Merle It was Ferdinand Holm How do you do Madam
he said giving her a dry bony hand

Why this is quite a baronial seat you have here he added looking
round and settling his pincenez

His companion was a round plump gentleman with a little black goatee
beard and dark eyes that blinked continually But his smile was full of
mirth and the grip of his hand felt true So this was Klaus Brock

Peer led his two friends in through the rooms showing them the view
from the various windows Klaus broke into a laugh at last and turned
to Merle Hes just the same as ever he saida little stouter to
be sureits clear youve been treating him well madam And he bowed
and kissed her hand

There was hock and seltzer ready for themthis was Merles idea as
suitable for a hot dayand when the two visitors had each drunk off
a couple of glasses with an Ah delicious Peer came behind her
stroked her hand lightly and whispered Thanks Merlefirstrate idea
of yours

By the way exclaimed Ferdinand Holm suddenly I must send off a
telegram May I use the telephone a moment

There he goescant contain himself any longer burst out Klaus
Brock with a laugh Hes had the telegraph wires going hard all the way
across Europebut you might let us get inside and sit down before you
begin again here

Come along said Peer Heres the telephone

When the two had left the room Klaus turned to Merle with a smile
Well wellso Im really in the presence of Peers wifehis wife in
flesh and blood And this is what she looks like That fellow always had
all the luck And he took her hand again and kissed it Merle drew it
away and blushed

You are not married then Mr Brock

I Well yes and no I did marry a Greek girl once but she ran away
Just my luck And he blinked his eyes and sighed with an expression so
comically sad that Merle burst out laughing

And your friend Ferdinand Holm she asked

He dear ladyhewhy saving your presence I have an idea theres a
select little harem attached to that palace of his

Merle turned towards the window and shook her head with a smile

An hour later the visitors came down from their rooms after a wash and
a change of clothes and after a light luncheon Peer carried them off to
show them round the place He had added a number of new buildings and
had broken new land The farm had forty cows when he came now he had
over sixty Of course all this is a mere nothing for fellows like you
who bring your harvest home in railway trains he said But you see
I have my home here And he waved his hand towards the house and the
farmstead round

Later they drove over in the light trap to look at the workshop and
here he made no excuses for its being small He showed off the
little foundry as if it had been a worldfamous seat of industry and
maintained his serious air while his companions glanced sideways at him
trying hard not to smile

The workmen touched their caps respectfully and sent curious glances at
the strangers

Quite a treat to see things on the Norwegian scale again Ferdinand
Holm couldnt resist saying at last

Yes isnt it charming cried Peer putting on an air of ingenuous
delight This is just the size a foundry should be if its owner is to
have a good time and possess his soul in peace

Ferdinand Holm and Brock exchanged glances But next moment Peer led
them through into a sideroom with tools and machinery evidently having
no connection with the rest

Now look out said Klaus This is the holy of holies youll see
Hes hard at it working out some new devilry here or Im a Dutchman

Peer drew aside a couple of tarpaulins and showed them a mowing machine
of the ordinary type and beside it another the model of a new type he
had himself devised

Its not quite finished yet he said But Ive solved the main
problem The old single knifeblade principle was clumsy dragged you
know But with two bladesa pair of shears so to speakitll work
much quicker And he gave them a little lecture showing how much
simpler his mechanism was and how much lighter the machine would be

And there you are said Klaus Its Columbuss egg over again

The patent ought to be worth a million said Ferdinand Holm slowly
looking out of the window

Of course the main thing is to make the work easier and cheaper for
the farmers said Peer with a rather sly glance at Ferdinand

Dinner that evening was a festive meal When the liqueur brandy went
round Klaus greeted it with enthusiasm Why heres an old friend as
I live Real Lysholmerwell well and so youre still in the land of
the living You remember the days when we were boys together He lifted
the little glass and watched the light play in the pale spirit And the
three old friends drank together singing The first full glass and
then The second little nip with the proper ceremonial observances
just as they had done in the old days at their student wineparties

The talk went merrily one good story calling up another But Merle
could not help noticing the steely gleam of Ferdinand Holms eyes even
when he laughed

The talk fell on new doings in Egypt and as Peer heard more and more of
these it seemed to her that his look changed His glance too seemed
to have that glint of steel there was something strange and absent in
his face was he feeling perhaps that wife and children were but
a drag on a man after all He seemed like an old warhorse waking
suddenly at the sound of trumpets

Theres a nice little job waiting for you by the way said Ferdinand
Holm lifting his glass to Peer

Very kind of you Im sure A subdirectorship under you

Youre no good under any one You belong on top Ferdinand illustrated
his words with a downward and an upward pointing of the finger The
harnessing of the Tigris and Euphrates will have to be taken in hand
Its only a question of time

Thanks very much said Peer his eyes wide open now

The plans simply lying waiting for the right man It will be carried
out it may be next year it may be in ten yearswhenever the man comes
along I would think about it if I were you

All looked at Peer Merle fastened her eyes on him too But he laughed
Now what on earth would be the satisfaction to me of binding in bands
those two ancient and honourable rivers

Well in the first place it would mean an increase of many millions
of bushels in the corn production of the world Wouldnt you have any
satisfaction in that

No said Peer with a touch of scorn

Or regular lines of communication over hundreds of thousands of square
miles of the most fertile country on the globe

Dont interest me said Peer

Ah Ferdinand Holm lifted his glass to Merle Tell me dear lady how
does it feel to be married to an anachronism

Toto what stammered Merle

Yes your husbands an anachronism He might if he chose be one of
the kings the prophets who lead the van in the fight for civilisation
But he will not he despises his own powers and one day he will start a
revolution against himself Mark my words Your health dear lady

Merle laughed and lifted her glass but hesitatingly and with a
sideglance towards Peer

Yes your husband is no better now than an egoist a collector of happy
days

Well and is that so very wicked

He sits ravelling out his life into a multitude of golden threads
went on Ferdinand with a bow his steely eyes trying to look gentle

But what is wrong in that said the young wife stoutly

It is wrong It is wasting his immortal soul A man has no right to
ravel out his life even though the threads are of gold A mans days of
personal happiness are forgottenhis work endures And your husband
in particularwhy the deuce should HE be so happy The worldevolution
uses us inexorably either for light or for fuel And Peeryour
husband dear ladyis too good for fuel

Merle glanced again at her husband Peer laughed but then suddenly
compressed his lips and looked down at his plate

Then the nurse came in with little Louise to say goodnight and
the child was handed round from one to the other But when the little
fairhaired girl came to Ferdinand Holm he seemed loth to touch her
and Merle read his glance at Peer as meaning Here is another of the
bonds youve tied yourself up with

Excuse me he said suddenly looking at his watch Im afraid I must
ask for the use of the telephone again Pardon me Fru Holm And he
rose and left the room Klaus looked at the others and shook his head
That man would simply expire if he couldnt send a telegram once an
hour he said with a laugh

Coffee was served out on the balcony and the men sat and smoked It
was a dusky twilight of early autumn the hills were dark blue now and
distant there was a scent of hay and garden flowers After a while
Merle rose and said goodnight And in her thoughts when she found
herself alone in her bedroom she hardly knew whether to be displeased
or not These strange men were drawing Peer far away from all that had
been his chief delight since she had known him But it was interesting
to see how different his manner was towards the two friends Klaus Brock
he could jest and laugh with but with Ferdinand Holm he seemed always
on his guard ready to assert himself and whenever he contradicted him
it was always with a certain deference

The great yellow disc of the moon came up over the hills in the east
drawing a broad pillar of gold across the dark water And the three
comrades on the balcony sat watching it for a while in silence

So youre really going to go on idling here asked Ferdinand at last
sipping his liqueur

Is it me you mean asked Peer bending slightly forward

Well I gather youre going round here simply being happy from morning
to night I call that idling

Thanks

Of course youre very unhappy in reality Everyone is as long as hes
neglecting his powers and aptitudes

Very many thanks said Peer with a laugh Klaus sat up in his chair
a little anxious as to what was coming

Ferdinand was still looking out over the lake You seem to despise your
own tradeas engineer

Yes said Peer

And why

Why I feel the lack of some touch of beauty in our ceaseless craving
to create something new something new always something new More gold
more speed more foodare these things not all we are driving at

My dear fellow gold means freedom And food means life And speed
carries us over the dead moments Double the possibilities of life for
men and you double their numbers

And what good will it do to double their numbers Two thousand million
machinemade soulsis that what you want

But hang it all man put in Klaus Brock eagerly think of our dear
Norway at least Surely you dont think it would be a misfortune if
our population increased so far that the world could recognise our
existence

I do said Peer looking away over the lake

Ah youre a fanatic for the small in size and in numbers

I am loth to see all Norway polluted with factories and proletariat
armies Why the devil cant we be left in peace

The steel will not have it said Ferdinand Holm as if speaking to the
pillar of moonlight on the water

What Who did you say Peer looked at him with wide eyes

Ferdinand went on undisturbed The steel will not have peace And the
fire will not And Prometheus will not The human spirit has still
too many steps to climb before it reaches the top Peace No my
friendthere are powers outside you and me that determine these
things

Peer smiled and lit a new cigar Ferdinand Holm leaned back in his
chair and went on addressing himself apparently to the moon
Tigris and EuphratesIndus and Gangesand all the rest of this
planetregulate and cultivate the whole and what is it after all
Its only a question of a few years It is only a humble beginning In
a couple of centuries or so there will be nothing left to occupy us
any more on this little globe of ours And then well have to set about
colonising other worlds

There was silence for a moment Then Peer spoke

And what do we gain by it all he asked

Gain Do you imagine there will ever be any thus far and no farther
for the spirit of man Half a million years hence all the solar systems
we know of now will be regulated and ordered by the human spirit
There will be difficulties of course Interplanetary wars will arise
planetary patriotism groups of planetary powers in alliances and
coalitions against other groups Little worlds will be subjugated by
the bigger ones and so on Is there anything in all this to grow dizzy
over Great heavenscan anyone doubt that man must go on conquering and
to conquer for millions of years to come The worldwill goes its way
We cannot resist Nobody asks whether we are happy The will that works
towards the infinite asks only whom it can use for its ends and who is
useless Viola tout

And when I die asked Peerwhat then

You Are you still going about feeling your own pulse and wanting to
live for ever My dear fellow YOU dont exist There is just one person
on our sidethe worldwill And that includes us all Thats what I
mean by we And we are working towards the day when we can make
God respect us in good earnest The spirit of man will hold a Day
of Judgment and settle accounts with Olympuswith the riddle the
almighty power beyond It will be a great reckoning And mark my
wordsthat is the one single religious idea that lives and works in
each and every one of usthe thing that makes us hold up our heads and
walk upright forgetting that we are slaves and things that die

Suddenly he looked at his watch Excuse me a moment If the telegraph
office is open    and he rose and went in

When he returned Klaus and Peer were talking of the home of their
boyhood and their early days together

Remember that time we went sharkfishing asked Klaus

Oh yesthat shark Let me seeyou were a hero werent you and beat
it to death with your bare fistswasnt that it And then Cut the
line cut the line and row for your lives he mimicked and burst out
laughing

Oh shut up now and dont be so witty said Klaus But tell me have
you ever been back there since you came home

Peer told him that he had been to the village last year His old
fosterparents were dead and Peter Ronningen too but Martin Bruvold
was there still living in a tiny cottage with eight children

Poor devil said Klaus

Ferdinand Holm had sat down again and now he nodded towards the moon
An old chum of yours Well why dont we send him a thousand crowns

There was a little pause I hope youll let me join you went on
Ferdinand taking a note for five hundred crowns from his waistcoat
pocket You dont mind do you

Peer glanced at him and took the note Im delighted for poor old
Martins sake he said putting the note in his waistcoat pocket
Thatll make fifteen hundred for him

Klaus Brock looked from one to the other and smiled a little The talk
turned on other things for a while and then he asked

By the way Peer have you seen that advertisement of the British
Carbide Companys

No what about

They want tenders for the damming and harnessing of the Besna River
with its lake system and falls That should be something in your line

No said Ferdinand sharply I told you beforethat jobs too small
for him Peers going to the Euphrates

What would it amount to roughly said Peer addressing no one in
particular

As far as I could make out it should be a matter of a couple of
million crowns or thereabout said Klaus

Thats not a thing for Peer said Ferdinand rising and lifting his
hand to hide a yawn Leave trifles like that to the trifling souls
Goodnight gentlemen

A couple of hours later when all was silent throughout the house Peer
was still up wandering to and fro in soft felt slippers in the great
hall Now and again he would stop and look out of the window Why could
he not sleep The moon was paling the day beginning to dawn



Chapter VIII


The next morning Merle was alone in the pantry when she heard steps
behind her and turned her head It was Klaus Brock

Goodmorning madamah so this is what you look like in morning
dress Why morning neglige might have been invented for you if I
may say so You might be a Ghirlandajo Or no better still Aspasia
herself

You are up early said Merle drily

Am I What about Ferdinand Holm then He has been up since sunrise
sitting over his letters and accounts Anything I can help you with May
I move that cheese for youWell well you are strong But there Im
always de trop where women are concerned

Always de trop repeated Merle watching him through her long lashes

Yesmy first and only lovedo you know who she was

No indeed How should I

Well it was LouisePeers little sister I wish you could have known
her

And since then Merle let her eyes rest on this flourishing gentleman
who looked as if he could never have had a trouble in the world

Since then dear ladysince then Let me see Why at this moment I
really cant remember ever having met any other woman except   

Except    

Except yourself madam And he bowed

You are TOO kind

And that being so dont you think its your plain duty as a
hospitable hostess to grant me   

Grant youwhat A piece of cheese

Why no thanks Something better Something much better than that

What then

A kiss I might as well have it now As he took a step nearer she
looked laughingly round for a way of escape but he was between her and
the door

Well said Merle but you must do something to make yourself useful
first Suppose you ran up that stepladder for me

Delighted Why this is great fun The slight wooden ladder creaked
under the weight of his solid form as he climbed How high am I to go

To reach the top shelfthats it Now you see that big brown jar
Carefulits cranberries

SplendidI do believe were to have cranberry preserve at dinner By
standing on tiptoe he managed to reach and lift the heavy jar and stood
holding it his face flushed with his exertions

And now little lady

Just stay there a moment and hold it carefully I have to fetch
something And she hurried out

Klaus stood at the top of the ladder holding the heavy jar He looked
round What was he to do with it He waited for Merle to returnbut she
did not appear Someone was playing the piano in the next room Should
he call for help He waited on getting redder and redder in the face
And still no Merle came

With another mighty effort he set the jar back in its place and then
climbed down the ladder and walked into the drawingroom very red and
out of breath In the doorway he stopped short and stared

Whatwell IllAnd shes sitting here playing the piano

Yes Arent you fond of music Herr Brock

Ill pay you out for this he said shaking a finger at her Just you
wait and see little lady if I dont pay you out with interest And
he turned and went upstairs chuckling as he went

Peer was sitting at the writingtable in his study when Klaus came in
Im just sealing up the letter with the money for Martin Bruvold
he said setting the taper to a stick of sealing wax Ive signed it
From the shark fishers

Yes it was a capital idea of Ferdinands What dyou think the poor
old fellowll say when he opens it and the big notes tumble out

Id like to see his face said Peer as he wrote the address on the
envelope

Klaus dropped into a leather armchair and leaned back comfortably Ive
been downstairs flirting a little with your wife he said Your wifes
a wonder Peer

Peer looked at him and thought of the old days when the heavybuilt
clumsy doctors son had run about after the servantgirls in the town
He had still something of his old lurching walk but intercourse with
the ladies of many lands had polished him and given lightness and ease
to his manner

What was I going to say Klaus went on Oh yesour friend
Ferdinands a fine fellow isnt he

Yes indeed

I felt yesterday exactly as I used to feel when we three were together
in the old days When I listen to his talk I cant help agreeing with
himand then you begin to speak and what you say too seems to be
just what Ive been thinking in my inmost soul Do you think Ive become
shallow Peer

Well your steam ploughs look after themselves I suppose and the
ladies of your harem dont trouble you overmuch Do you read at all

Best not say too much about that said Klaus with a sigh and it
suddenly struck Peer that his friends face had grown older and more
worn

No said Klaus again Better not say much about that But tell me
old fellowyou mustnt mind my askinghas Ferdinand ever spoken to you
as his brother    or   

Peer flushed hotly No he said after a pause

No

I owe more to him than to anybody in the world But whether he regards
me as a kinsman or simply as an object for his kindness to wreak itself
on is a matter hes always left quite vague

Its just like him Hes a queer fellow But theres another thing  


Well said Peer looking up

Itseragain its rather a delicate matter to touch on I know
of course that youre in the enviable position of having your fortune
invested in the best jointstock company in the world

Yes and so are you

Oh mines a trifle compared with yours Have you still the whole of
your money in Ferdinands company

Yes Ive been thinking of selling a few shares by the way As you
may suppose Ive been spending a good deal just latelymore than my
income

You mustnt sell just now Peer TheyreI daresay youve seen that
theyre downbelow par in fact

Whatbelow par No I had no idea of that

Oh only for the time being of course Just a temporary drop Theres
sure to be another run on them soon and theyll go up again But
the Khedive has the controlling interest you know and hes rather
a ticklish customer Ferdinand is all for extensionwants to keep
on buying up new landnew desert that is Irrigation theres just a
question of powerthats how he looks at it And of course the bigger
the scale of the work the cheaper the power will work out But the
Khedives holding back It may be just a temporary whimmay be all
right again tomorrow But you never know And if you think Ferdinands
the man to give in to a cranky Khedive youre much mistaken His idea
now is to raise all the capital he can lay hands on and buy him out
What do you say to that Buy the Khedive clean out of the company Its
a large order And if I were you old man as soon as the shares go up
again a bit Id sell out some of my holding and put the money into
something at home here After all there must be plenty of quite useful
things to be had here

Peer frowned and sat for a while looking straight before him No he
said at last As things stand between Ferdinand Holm and mewell if
either of us goes back on the other its not going to be me

Ah in that caseI beg your pardon said Klaus and he rose and
departed

The christening was a great occasion with a houseful of guests and a
great deal of speechmaking The host was the youngest and gayest of
the party The birth of his son should be celebrated in true Ethiopian
fashion he declaredwith bonfires and boating parties

The moon was hidden that evening behind thick dark clouds but the boats
full of guests glided over the black water to the accompaniment of music
and laughter The young madcap of a lawyer was there again sitting on
the lap of someone elses wife and playing a concertina till people
in the farms on shore opened their windows and put their heads out to
listen

Later on the bonfires blazed up all along the lake shore and shone like
great flaming suns in the water below The guests lay on the grass in
little groups round picnic suppers and here and there a couple wandered
by themselves talking in whispers

Merle and Peer stood together for a moment beside one of the bonfires
Their faces and figures were lit by the red glow they looked at each
other and exchanged a smile He took her hand and led her outside the
circle of light from the fire and pointed over to their home with all
its windows glowing against the dark

Suppose this should be the last party we give Merle

Peer what makes you say that

Oh nothingonly I have a sort of feeling as if something had just
ended and something new was to begin I feel like it somehow But I
wanted to thank you too for all the happy times weve had

But Peerwhat She got no farther for Peer had already left her and
joined a group of guests where he was soon as gay as the rest

Then came the day when the two visitors were to leave Their birthday
gift to the young gentleman so lately christened Lorentz Uthoug stood in
the drawingroom it was a bust in red granite the height of a man
of the Sungod Re Hormachis brought with them by the godfathers from
Alexandria And now it sat in the drawingroom between palms in pots
pressing its elbows against its sides and gazing with great dead eyes
out into endless space

Peer stood on the quay waving farewell to his old comrades as the
steamer ploughed through the water drawing after it a fanshaped trail
of little waves

And when he came home he walked about the place looking at farms and
woods at Merle and the children with eyes that seemed to her strange
and new

Next night he stayed up once more alone pacing to and fro in the great
hall and looking out of the windows into the dark

Was he ravelling out his life into golden threads that vanished and were
forgotten

Was he content to be fuel instead of light

What was he seeking Happiness And beyond it As a boy he had called
it the anthem the universal hymn What was it now God But he would
hardly find Him in idleness

You have drawn such nourishment as you could from joy in your home from
your marriage your fatherhood nature and the fellowmen around you
here There are unused faculties in you that hunger for exercise that
long to be set free to work to strive to act

You should take up the barrage on the Besna Peer But could you get
the contract If you once buckleto in earnest no one is likely to beat
youyoull get it sure enough But do you really want it

Are you not working away at a mowingmachine as it is Better own up
that you cant get on without your old craft after allthat you must
for ever be messing and meddling with steel and fire You cant help
yourself

All the things your eyes have been fixed on in these last years have
been only golden visions in a mist The steel has its own will The
steel is beginning to wake in yousingingsingingbent on pressing
onward You have no choice

The worldwill goes on its way Go with it or be cast overboard as
useless

And still Peer walked up and down up and down

Next morning he set off for the capital Merle watched the carriage as
it drove away and thought to herself He was right Something new is
beginning



Chapter IX


There came a card from Peer with a brief message Off to inspect the
ground A fortnight later he came home loaded with maps and plans Of
course Im late for the fair as usual he said But wait a bit

He locked himself into his room At last Merle knew what it was like
to have him at work She could hear him in the mornings walking up and
down and whistling Then silencehe would be standing over his table
busy with notes and figures Then steps again Now he was singingand
this was a novelty to himself It was as if he carried in him a store
of happiness a treasure laid by of love and the beauty of nature and
happy hours and now it found its way out in song Why should he not
sing over the plans for a great barrage Mathematics are dry work
enough but at times they can be as living visions soaring up into the
light Peer sang louder Then silence again Merle never knew now when
he stopped work and came to bed She would fall asleep to the sound
of his singing in his own room and when she woke he would already be
tramping up and down again in there and to her his steps seemed
like the imperious tread of a great commander He was alight with new
visions new themes and his voice had a lordly ring Merle looked at
him through halfclosed eyes with a lingering glance Once more he was
new to her she had never seen him like this

At last the work was finished and he sent in his tender And now he was
more restless than ever For a week he waited for an answer tramping in
and out of the place going off for rides on Bijou and coming back with
his horse dripping with sweat An impatient man cannot possibly ride
at any pace but a gallop The days passed Peer was sleepless and ate
nothing More days passed At last he came bursting into the nursery
one morning Trunk call Merle summons to a meeting of the Company
Directors Quicks the word Come and help me packsharp And in no
time he was off again to the city

Now it was Merles turn to walk up and down in suspense It mattered
little to her in itself whether he got the work or not but she was
keenly anxious that he should win

A couple of days later a telegram came Hurrah wife And Merle danced
round the room waving the telegram above her head

The next day he was back home again and tramping up and down the room
What do you think your father will say to it Merleha

Father Say to what

When I ask him to be my surety for a couple of hundred thousand
crowns

Is father to be in it too Merle looked at him openeyed

Oh if he doesnt want to well let him off But at any rate Ill ask
him first Goodbye And Peer drove off into town

In Lorentz Uthougs big house you had to pass through the hardware shop
to get to his office which lay behind Peer knocked at the door with
a portfolio under his arm Herr Uthoug had just lit the gas and was
on the point of sitting down at his American rolltop desk when Peer
entered The greybearded head with the close thick hair turned towards
him darkened by the shadow from the green shade of the burner

You is it said he Sit down Youve been to Christiania I hear
And what are you busy with now

They sat down opposite each other Peer explained calmly and with
confidence

And what does the thing amount to asked Uthoug his face coming out
of the shadow and looking at Peer in the full light

Two million four hundred thousand

The old man laid his hairy hands on the desk and rose to his feet
staring at the other and breathing deeply The sum halfstunned him
Beside it he himself and his work seemed like dust in the balance Where
were all his plans and achievements now his greatness his position
his authority in the town Compared with amounts like this what were
the paltry sums he had been used to handle

II didnt quite catch he stammered Did you say two millions

Yes I daresay it seems a trifle to you said Peer Indeed Ive
handled contracts myself that ran to fifty million francs

What How much did you say Uthoug began to move restlessly about the
room He clutched his hair and gazed at Peer as if doubting whether he
was quite sober

At the same time he felt it would never do to let himself be so easily
thrown off his balance He tried to pull himself together

And what do you make out of it he asked

A couple of hundred thousand I hope

Oh A profit on this scale again rather startled the old man No he
was nothing he never had been anything in this world

How do you know that you will make so much

Ive calculated it all out

But ifbut how can you be sure of it Suppose youve got your figures
wrong His head was thrust forward again into the full light

Im in the habit of getting my figures right said Peer

When he broached the question of security the old man was in the act of
moving away from him across the room But he stopped short and looked
back over his shoulder

What Security You want me to stand security for two million crowns

No the Company asks for a guarantee for four hundred thousand

After a pause the old man said I see Yes I see Butbut Im not
worth as much as that altogether

I can put in three hundred thousand of the four myself in shares And
then of course I have the Loreng property and the works But put it
at a round figurewill you guarantee a hundred thousand

There was another pause and then the reply came from the far end of the
room to which Uthoug had drifted Even thats a big sum

Of course if you would rather not I could make other arrangements My
two friends who have just been here He rose and began to gather up
his papers

No no you mustnt be in such a hurry Why you come down on a
man like an avalanche You must give me time to think it overtill
tomorrow at least And the papersat any rate I must have a look at
them

Uthoug passed a restless and troubled night The solid ground seemed to
have failed him his mind could find no firm foothold His soninlaw
must be a great manhe should be the last to doubt it But a hundred
thousandto be ventured not in landed property or a big trade deal
but on the success of a piece of construction work This was something
new It seemed fantasticsuited to the great world outside perhaps
or the future Had he courage enough to stand in Who could tell what
accidents what disasters might not happen No He shook his head
He could not He dared not Butthe thing tempted him He had always
wanted to be something more than a whale among the minnows Should
he risk it Should he not It meant staking his whole fortune his
position everything upon the outcome of a piece of engineering that
he understood nothing whatever about It was sheer speculation it
was gambling No he must say No Then he was only a whale among the
minnows after all No he must say Yes Good God He clenched his
hands together they were clammy with sweat and his brain was in a
whirl It was a trial a temptation He felt an impulse to pray But
what good could that dosince he had himself abolished God

Next day Merle and Peer were rung up by telephone and asked to come in
to dinner with the old folks

But when they were all sitting at table they found it impossible to
keep the conversation going Everyone seemed shy of beginning on the
subject they were all thinking about The old mans face was grey
with want of sleep his wife looked from one to the other through her
spectacles Peer was calm and smiling

At last when the claret came round Fru Uthoug lifted her glass and
drank to Peer Good fortune she said We wont be the ones to stand
in your way Since you think it is all right of course it is And we
all hope it will turn out well for you Peer

Merle looked at her parents she had sat through the meal anxious and
troubled and now the tears rose into her eyes

Thanks said Peer lifting his glass and drinking to his host and
hostess Thanks he repeated bowing to old Uthoug The matter was
arranged Evidently the two old folks had talked it over together and
come to an agreement

It was settled but all four felt as if the solid ground were rocking
a little under their feet All their future their fate seemed staked
upon a throw

A couple of days later a day of mild October sunshine Peer happened
to go into the town and catching sight of his motherinlaw at the
window he went off and bought some flowers and took them up to her

She was sitting looking out at the yellow sky in the west and she
hardly turned her head as she took the flowers Thanks Peer she
said and continued gazing out at the sky

What are you thinking of dear mother asked Peer

Ah it isnt a good thing always to tell our thoughts she said and
she turned her spectacled eyes so as to look out over the lake

I hope it was something pleasant

I was thinking of you Peer Of you and Merle

It is good of you to think of us

You see Peer there is trouble coming for you A great deal of
trouble She nodded her head towards the yellow sky in the west

Trouble Why Why should trouble come to us

Because you are happy Peer

What Because I am

Because all things blossom and flourish about you Be sure that there
are unseen powers enough that grudge you your happiness

Peer smiled You think so he asked

I know it she answered with a sigh gazing out into the distance
You have made enemies of late amongst all those envious shadows that
none can see But they are all around us I see them every day I have
learned to know them in all these years I have fought with them And
it is well for Merle that she has learned to sing in a house so full of
shadows God grant she may be able to sing them away from you too

When Peer left the house he felt as if little shudders of cold were
passing down his back Pooh he exclaimed as he reached the street
She is not right in her head And he hurried to his carriole and drove
off home

Old Rode will be pleased anyhow he thought Hell be his own master
in the workshop nowthe dream of his life Well everyone for himself
And the bailiff will have things all his own way at Loreng for a year or
two Well well Come up Brownie



Chapter X


Peer youre surely not going away just now Oh Peer you mustnt You
wont leave me alone Peer

Merle dear now do be sensible No nodo let go dear He tried to
disengage her hands that were clasped behind his neck

Peer you have never been like this before Dont you care for me any
moreor the children

Merle dearest you dont imagine that I like going But you surely
dont want me to have another big breach this year It would be sheer
ruin I do assure you Come come now let me go

But she held him fast And what happens to those dams up there is more
to you now than what becomes of me

You will be all right dear The doctor and the nurse have promised to
be on the spot the moment you send word And you managed so well before
   I simply cannot stay now Merle Theres too much at stake There
there goodbye Be sure you telegraph He kissed her over the eyes
put her gently down into a chair and hurried out of the room feeling
her terrified glance follow him as he went

The April sun had cleared away the snow from the lowlands but when
Peer stepped out of the train up in Espedal he found himself back in
winterfarms and fields still covered and ridges and peaks deep
in white dazzling snow And soon he was sitting wrapped in his furs
driving a miserable dun pony up a sidevalley that led out on to the
uplands

The road was a narrow track through the snow yellow with horsedung
and a mass of holes and ruts worn by his own teams that had hauled
their heavy loads of cement this way all through that winter and the
last up to the plateau and across the frozen lakes to Besna

The steel will on The steel cares nothing for human beings Merle must
come through it alone

When a healthy happy man is hampered and thwarted in a great work
by annoyances and disasters he behaves like an Arab horse on a heavy
march At first it moves at a brisk trot uphill and downhill and it
goes faster and faster as its strength begins to flag And when at last
it is thoroughly out of breath and ready to drop it breaks into an easy
gallop

This was not the work he had once dreamed of finding Now as
before his hunger for eternal things seemed ever at the side of his
accomplishment asking continually Whither Why and What then

But by degrees the difficulties had multiplied and mounted till at last
his whole mind was taken up by the one thoughtto put it through Good
or bad in itselfhe must make a success of it He had undertaken it
and he must see it through He must not be beaten

And so he fought on It was merely a trial of strength a fight with
material difficulties Aye but was that all it was Were there not
times when he felt himself struggling with something greater something
worse A new motive force seemed to have come into his lifemisfortune
A power outside his own will had begun to play tricks with him

Your calculations may be sound correct in every detail and yet things
may go altogether wrong

Who could include in his calculations the chance that a perfectly sober
engineer will get drunk one day and give orders so crazy that it costs
tens of thousands to repair the damage Who could foresee that against
all probability a big vein of water would be tapped in tunnelling and
would burst out flooding the workings and overwhelming the workmenso
that the next day a train of unpainted deal coffins goes winding out
over the frozen lakes

More than once there had been remarks and questions in the newspapers
Another disaster at the Besna Falls Who is to blame

It was because he himself was away on a business journey and Falkman had
neglected to take elementary precautions that the big rockfall
occurred in the tunnel killing four men and destroying the new Belgian
rockdrill that had cost a good hundred thousand before it had begun
to work This sort of thing was not faulty calculationit was malicious
fate

Come up boy We must get there tonight The flood mustnt have a
chance this year to lay the blame on me because I wasnt on the spot

And then to cap the other misfortunes his chief contractor for
material had gone bankrupt and now prices had risen far above the rates
he had allowed foradding fresh thousands to the extra expenditure

But he would put the thing through even if he lost money by it His
envious rivals who had lately begun to run down his projects in the
technical papershe would make them look foolish yet

And then

Well it may be that the Promethean spirit is preparing a settling day
for the universe somewhere out in infinity But what concern is that of
mine What about my own immortal soul

Silencepush on push on There may be a snowstorm any minute Come
upget along you scarecrow

The dun struggles on to the end of a twelvemile stage and then the
valley ends and the full blast from the plateau meets them Here lies
the posting station the last farm in the valley He swings into the
yard and is soon sitting in the room over a cup of coffee and a pipe

Merle How are things with Merle now

Ah here comes his own horse the big black stallion from Gudbrandsdal
This beasts trot is a different thing from the poor dunsthe sleigh
flies up to the door And in a moment Peer is sitting in it again in his
furs

Ah what a relief to have a fresh horse and one that makes light of
the load behind him Away he goes at a brisk trot with lifted head and
bells jingling over the frozen lakes Here and there on the hillslopes
a grey hut or two show outsaeters which have lain there unchanged
for perhaps a couple of thousand years But a new time is coming The
saeterhorns will be heard no longer and the song of the turbines will
rise in their place

An icy wind is blowing the horse throws up its head and snorts Big
snowflakes come driving on the wind and soon a regular snowstorm is
raging lashing the travellers face till he gasps First the horses
mane and tail grow white with snow then its whole body The drifts grow
bigger the black has to make great bounds to clear them Bravo old
boy we must get there before dark There are brushwood brooms set out
across the ice to mark the way but who could keep them in sight in a
driving smother like this Peers own face is plastered white now and
he feels stunned and dazed under the lash of the snow

He has worked under the burning suns of Egyptand now here But the
steel will on The wave rolls on its way over all the world

If this snow should turn to rain now it will mean a flood And then the
men will have to turn out tonight and work to save the dams

One more disaster and he would hardly be able to finish within the
contract time And that once exceeded each days delay means a penalty
of a thousand crowns

It is getting darker

At last there is nothing to be seen on the way but a shapeless mass of
snow struggling with bowed head against the storm wading deep in the
loose drifts wading seemingly at haphazardand trailing after it an
indefinable bundle of whitedead white Behind a human being drags
along holding on for dear life to the rings on the sleigh It is the
postboy from the last stage

At last they were groping their way in the darkness towards the shore
where the electric lights of the station showed faintly through the
snowfog And hardly had Peer got out of the sleigh before the snow
stopped suddenly and the dazzling electric suns shone over the place
with the workmens barracks the assistants quarters the offices and
his own little plankbuilt house Two of the engineers came out to meet
him and saluted respectfully

Well how is everything getting on

The greybeard answered The men have struck work today

Struck What for

They want us to take back the machinist that was dismissed the other
day for drunkenness

Peer shook the snow from his fur coat took his bag and walked over to
the building the others following Then well have to take him back
he said We cant afford a strike now


A couple of days later Peer was lying in bed when the postbag was
brought in He shook the letters out over the coverlet and caught sight
of one from Klaus Brook

What was this Why did his hand tremble as he took it up Of course it
was only one of Klauss ordinary friendly letters


DEAR FRIENDThis is a hard letter to write But I do hope you have
taken my advice and got some of your money at any rate over to Norway
Well to be as brief as possible Ferdinand Holm has decamped or is
in prison or possibly worseyou know well enough its no good asking
questions in a country like this when a big man suddenly disappears
He had made enemies in the highest places he was playing a dangerous
gameand this is the end of it

You know what it means when a business goes into liquidation out here
and no strong man on the spot to look after things We Europeans can
whistle for our share

Youll take it coolly I know Ive lost every penny I hadbut youve
still got your place over there and the workshops And youre the sort
of fellow to make twice as much next time or I dont know you I hope
the Besna barrage is to be a success

Yours ever

KLAUS BROCK

PSOf course youll understand that now my friend has been thrown
overboard it will very likely be my turn next But I cant leave nowto
try would rouse suspicion at once We foreigners have some difficult
balancing to do to escape a fall Well if by chance you dont hear
from me again youll know something has happened


Outside the water was streaming down the channels into the fall Peer
lay still for a while only one knee moving up and down beneath the
clothes He thought of his two friends And he thought that he was now a
poor manand that the greater part of the burden of the security would
fall now on old Lorentz D Uthoug

Clearly Fate has other business on hand than making things easy for
you Peer You must fight your fight out singlehanded



Chapter XI


One evening in the late autumn Merle was sitting at home waiting for her
husband He had been away for several weeks so it was only natural that
she should make a little festivity of his return The lamps were lit in
all the rooms wood fires were crackling in all the stoves the cook was
busy with his favourite dishes and little Louise now five years old
had on her blue velvet frock She was sitting on the floor nursing two
dolls and chattering to them Mind youre a good girl now Josephine
Your grandpa will be here directly Merle looked in through the kitchen
door Have you brought up the claret Bertha Thats right Youd
better put it near the stove to warm Then she went round all the rooms
again The two youngest children were in bedwas there anything more to
be done

It would be an hour at least before he could be here yet she could not
help listening all the time for the sound of wheels But she had not
finished yet She hurried up to the bathroom turned on the hot water
undressed and put on an oilskin cap to keep her hair dry and soon
she was splashing about with soap and sponge Why not make herself as
attractive as she could even if things did look dark for them just now

A little stream of talk went on in her brain Strange that ones
body could be so great a pleasure to another Here he kissed youand
hereand hereand often he seemed beside himself with joy And do
you rememberthat time You held back and were cold oftenperhaps too
oftenis it too late now Ah he has other things to think of now The
time is gone by when you could be comfort enough to him in all troubles
But is it quite gone by Oh yes last time he came home he hardly
seemed to notice that we had a new little girl that he had never seen
before Well no doubt it must be so He did not complain and he
was calm and quiet but his mind was full of a whole world of serious
things a world where there was no room for wife and children Will it
be the same this evening again Will he notice that you have dressed so
carefully to please him Will it be a joy to him any more to feel his
arms around you

She stood in front of the big whiteframed mirror and looked
critically at herself No she was no longer young as she had been The
red in her cheeks had faded a little these last few years and there
were one or two wrinkles that could not be hidden But her eyebrowshe
had loved to kiss them oncethey were surely much as before And
involuntarily she bent towards the glass and stroked the dark growth
above her eyes as if it were his hand caressing her

She came down at last dressed in a loose blue dress with a broad lace
collar and blond lace in the wide sleeves And not to seem too
much dressed she had put on a redflowered apron to give herself a
housewifely look

It was past seven now Louise came whimpering to her and Merle sank
down in a chair by the window and took the child on her lap and
waited

The sound of wheels in the night may mean the approach of fate itself
Some decision some final word that casts us down in a moment from
wealth to ruinwho knows Peer had been to England now trying to come
to some arrangement with the Company Shwas that not wheels She
rose trembling and listened

No it had passed on

It was eight oclock now time for Louise to go to bed and Merle began
undressing her Soon the child was lying in her little white bed with
a doll on either side Give Papa a tiss she babbled and give him
my love And Mama do you think hell let me come into his bed for a bit
tomorrow morning

Oh yes Im sure he will And now lie down and go to sleep theres a
good girl

Merle sat down again in the room and waited But at last she rose put
on a cloak and went out

The town lay down there in the autumn darkness under a milkwhite mist
of light And over the black hills all around rose a world of stars
Somewhere out there was Peer far out maybe upon some country road the
horse plodding on through the dark at its own will its master sitting
with bowed head brooding

Help us Thou aboveand help him most he has had so much adversity in
these last days

But the starry vault seems icy coldit has heard the prayers of
millions and millions beforethe hearts of men are nothing to the
universe

Merle drooped her head and went in again to the house

It was midnight when Peer drove up the hill towards his home The
sight of the great house with its brilliantly lighted windows jarred so
cruelly on his wearied mind that he involuntarily gave the horse a cut
with his whip

He flung the reins to the stableboy who had come out with a lantern
and walked up the steps moving almost with a feeling of awe in this
great house as if it already belonged to someone else

He opened the door of the drawingroomno one there but light light
and comfort He passed through into the next room and there sat Merle
alone in an armchair with her head resting on the arm asleep

Had she been waiting so long

A wave of warmth passed through him he stood still looking at her and
presently her bowed figure slowly straightened her pale face relaxed
into a smile Without waking her he went on into the nursery where
the lights were still burning But here the lights shone only on three
little ones lying in their clean nightclothes asleep

He went back to the diningroom more lights and a table laid for
two a snowy cloth and flowers and a single carnation stuck into his
napkinthat must be from Louiselittle Louise

At last Merle was awakened by the touch of his hand on her shoulder

Oh are you there

Goodevening Merle They embraced and he kissed her forehead But
she could see that his mind was busy with other things

They sat down to table and began their meal She could read the
expression of his face his voice his calm airshe knew they meant bad
news

But she would not question him She would only try to show him that all
things else could be endured if only they two loved each other

But the time had passed when an unexpected caress from her was enough
to send him wild with joy She sat there now trembling inwardly with
suspense wondering if he would notice herif he could find any comfort
in having her with him still young and with something of her beauty
left

He looked over to her with a faraway smile Merle he asked what do
you think your father is worth altogether The words came like a quiet
order from a captain standing on the bridge while his ship goes down

Oh Peer dont think about all that tonight Welcome home And she
smiled and took his hand

Thanks he said and pressed her fingers but his thoughts were still
far off And he went on eating without knowing what he ate

And what do you think Louise has begun the violin Youve no idea how
the little thing takes to it

Oh

And Astas got another toothshe had a wretched time poor thing
while it was coming through

It was as if she were drawing the children up to him to show him that
at least he still had them

He looked at her for a moment Merle you ought never to have married
me It would have been better for you and for your people too

Oh nonsense Peeryou know youll be able to make it all right
again

They went up to bed and undressed slowly He hasnt noticed me yet
thought Merle

And she laughed a little and said I was sitting thinking this evening
of the first day we met I suppose you never think of it now

He turned round half undressed and looked at her Her lively tone
fell strangely on his ears She does not ask how I have got on or how
things are going he thought But as he went on looking at her he began
at last to see through her smile to the anxious heart beneath

Ah yes he remembered well that faroff summer when life had been a
holiday in the hills and a girl making coffee over a fire had smiled at
him for the first time And he remembered the first sunred night of his
love on the shining lakemirror when his heart was filled with the rush
of a great anthem to heaven and earth

She stood there still He had her yet But for the first time in their
lives she came to him now humbly begging him to make the best of her as
she was

An unspeakable warmth began to flow through his heavy heart But he
did not rush to embrace her and whirl her off in a storm of passionate
delight He stood still staring before him and drawing himself up
swore to himself with fastclosed lips that he would he WOULD trample a
way through and save things for them both even yet

The lights were put out and soon they lay in their separate beds
breathing heavily in the dark Peer stretched himself out with his face
up thinking with closed eyes He was hunting in the dark for some way
to save his dear ones And Merle lay so long waiting for one caress from
him that at last she had to draw out her handkerchief and press it over
her eyes while her body shook with a noiseless sobbing



Chapter XII


Old Lorentz D Uthoug rarely visited his rich sister at Bruseth but
today he had taken his weary way up there and the two masterful old
folks sat now facing each other

So youve managed to find your way up here said Aunt Marit throwing
out her ample bosom and rubbing her knees like a man

Why yesI thought Id like to see how you were getting on said
Uthoug squaring his broad shoulders

Quite well thanks Having no soninlaw Im not likely to go
bankrupt I daresay

Im not bankrupt either said old Uthoug fixing his red eyes on her
face

Perhaps not But what about him

Neither is he Hell be a rich man before very long

Herich Did you say rich

Before a years out answered the old man calmly But youll have to
help

I Aunt Marit shifted her chair backwards gaping I did you say
Hahaha Just tell me how many hundreds of thousands did he lose over
that ditch or drain or whatever it was

He was six months behind time in finishing it I know But the
Company agreed to halve the forfeit for delay when theyd seen what a
masterpiece the work was

Ah yesand what about the contractors whom he couldnt pay I hear

Hes paid them all in full now The Bank arranged things

I see After you and he had mortaged every stick and rag you had in the
world Yes indeedyou deserve a good whipping the pair of you

Uthoug stroked his beard From a financial point of view the thing
wasnt a success for him Ill admit But I can show you here what
the engineering people say about it in the technical papers Heres an
article with pictures of him and of the barrage

Well hed better keep his family on pictures in the papers then said
the widow paying no attention to the paper he offered

Hell soon be on top again said her brother putting the papers back
in his pocket He sat there in front of her quite unruffled He would
let people see that he was not the man to be crushed by a reverse that
there were other things he valued more than money

Soon be on top repeated Aunt Marit Has he got round you again with
some nonsense

Hes invented a new mowing machine Its nearly finished And the
experts say it will be worth a million

Ho and you want to come over me with a tale like that The widow
shifted her chair a little farther back

You must help us to carry on through this yearboth of us If you will
stand security for thirty thousand the bank   

Aunt Marit of Bruseth slapped her knees emphatically Ill do nothing
of the sort

For twenty thousand then

Not for twenty pence

Lorentz Uthoug fixed his gaze on his sisters face his red eyes began
to glow

Youll have to do it Marit he said calmly He took a pipe from his
pocket and set to work to fill and light it

The two sat for a while looking at each other each on the alert for
fear the others will should prove the stronger They looked at each
other so long that at last both smiled involuntarily

I suppose youve taken to going to church with your wife now asked
the widow at last her eyes blinking derision

If I put my trust in the Lord he said I might just sit down and
pray and let things go to ruin As it is Ive more faith in human
works and thats why Im here now

The answer pleased her The widow at Bruseth was no churchgoer herself
She thought the Lord had made a bad mistake in not giving her any
children

Will you have some coffee she asked rising from her seat

Now youre talking sense said her brother and his eyes twinkled He
knew his sister and her ways And now he lit his pipe and leaned back
comfortably in his chair



Chapter XIII


Once more Peer stood in his workroom down at the foundry wrestling with
fire and steel

A working drawing is a useful thing an idea in ones head is all very
well But the men he employed to turn his plans into tangible models
worked slowly why not use his own hands for what had to be done

When the workmen arrived at the foundry in the morning there was
hammering going on already in the little room And when they left in the
evening the master had not stopped working yet When the good citizens
of Ringeby went to bed they would look out of their windows and see his
light still burning

Peer had had plenty to tire him out even before he began work here But
in the old days no one had ever asked if he felt strong enough to do
this or that And he never asked himself Now as before it was a
question of getting something done at any cost And never before had
there been so much at stake

The wooden model of the new machine is finished already and the
castings put together The whole thing looks simple enough and
yetwhat a distance from the first rough implement to this thing which
seems almost to livea thing with a brain of metal at least Have not
these wheels and axles had their parents and ancestorstheir pedigree
stretching back into the past The steel has brought forth and its
descendants again in turn advancing always toward something finer
stronger more efficient And here is the last stage reached by human
invention in this particular work up to nowyet after all is it
good enough An invention successful enough to bring money in to the
inventorthat is not all It must be more it must be a worldsuccess
a thing to make its way across the prairies across the enormous plains
of India and Egyptthat is what is needed Sleep rest food What are
such things when so much is at stake

There was no longer that questioning in his ear Why Whither What
then Useless to ponder on these things His horizon was narrowed down
to include nothing beyond this one problem Once he had dreamed of a
work allied to his dreams of eternity This certainly was not it What
does the gain amount to after all when humanity has one more machine
added to it Does it kindle a single ray of dawn the more in a human
soul

Yet this work such as it was had now become his all It must and
should be all He was fast bound to it

When he looked up at the window there seemed to be faces at each pane
staring in What Not finished yet they seemed to say Think what it
means if you fail Merles face and the childrens Must we be driven
from Loreng out into the cold The faces of old Uthoug and his wife
Was it for this you came into an honourable family To bring it to
ruin And behind them swarming all the town All knew what was at
stake and why he was toiling so All stared at him waiting The Bank
Manager was there toowaiting like the rest

One can seize ones neck in iron pincers and say You shall Tired
difficulties time too shortall that doesnt exist You shall
Is this thing or that impossible Well make it possible It is your
business to make it possible

He spent but little time at home now a sofa in the workshop was his
bed Often Merle would come in with food for him and seeing how pale
and grey and worn out he was she did not dare to question him She
tried to jest instead She had trained herself long ago to be gay in a
house where shadows had to be driven off with laughter

But one day as she was leaving he held her back and looked at her
with a strange smile

Well dear she said with a questioning look

He stood looking at her as before with the same faroff smile He was
looking through her into the little world she stood for This home this
family that he a homeless man had won through her was it all to go
down in shipwreck

Then he kissed her eyes and let her go

And as her footsteps died away he stood a moment moved by a sudden
desire to turn to some Power above him with a prayer that he might
succeed in this work But there was no such Power And in the end his
eyes turned once more to the iron the fire his tools and his own
hands and it was as though he sighed out a prayer to these Help
mehelp me that I may save my wife and childrens happiness

Sleep rest weariness He had only a years grace The bank would only
wait a year

Winter and spring passed and one day in July he came home and rushed in
upon Merle crying Tomorrow Merle They will be here tomorrow

Who

The people to look at the machine Were going to try it tomorrow

Oh Peer she said breathlessly gazing at him

Its a good thing that I had connections abroad he went on Theres
one man coming from an English firm and another from America It ought
to be a big business

The morrow came Merle stood looking after her husband as he drove off
his hat on the back of his head through the haze that followed the
nights rain But there was no time to stand trembling they were to
have the strangers to dinner and she must see to it

Out in the field the machine stood ready a slender newly painted
thing A boy was harnessing the horses

Two men in soft hats and light overcoats came up it was old Uthoug
and the Bank Manager They stopped and looked round leaning on their
sticks the results of the day were not a matter of entire indifference
to these two gentlemen Ah here was the big carriage from Loreng with
the two strangers and Peer himself who had been down to fetch them from
the hotel

He was a little pale as he took the reins and climbed to his seat on
the machine to drive it himself through the meadow of high thick
timothygrass

The horses pricked up their ears and tried to break into a gallop the
noise of the machine behind them startling them as usual at first but
they soon settled down to a steady pace and the steel arm bearing the
shears swept a broad swath through the meadow where the grass stood
shining after the rain

The two strangers walked slowly in the rear bending down now and again
to look at the stubble and see if the shears cut clean The tall man
with the heavy beard and pincenez was the agent for John Fowler of
Leeds the little cleanshaven one with the Jewish nose represented
Harrow  Co of Philadelphia

Now and again they called to Peer to stop while they investigated some
part of the machine

They asked him then to try it on different ground on an uneven slope
over little tussocks and at last the agent for Fowlers would have it
that it should be tried on a patch of stony ground But that would spoil
the shears Very likely but Fowlers would like to know exactly how the
shears were affected by stones on the ground

At last the trials were over and the visitors nodded thoughtfully to
each other Evidently they had come on something new here There were
possibilities in the thing that might drive most other types out of the
field even in the intense competition that rages all round the world in
agricultural machinery

Peer read the expression in their eyesthese coldblooded specialists
had seen the vision they had seen gold

But all the same there was a hitcha little hitch

Dinner was over the visitors had left and Merle and Peer were alone
She lifted her eyes to his inquiringly

It went off well then she asked

Yes But there is just one little thing to put right

Still something to put rightafter you have worked so hard all these
months She sat down and her hands dropped into her lap

Its only a small detail he said eagerly pacing up and down When
the grass is wet it sticks between the steel fingers above the shears
and accumulates there and gets in the way Its the devil and all that
I never thought of testing it myself in wet weather But once Ive got
that right my girl the thing will be a worldsuccess

Once more the machine was set up in his workshop and he walked around
it watching spying thinking racking his brain to find the little
device that should make all well All else was finished all was
right but he still lacked the single happy thought the flash of
inspirationthat given a moments work would be enough to give this
thing of steel life and wings with which to fly out over the wide
world

It might come at any moment that happy thought And he tramped round
and round his machine clenching his fists in desperation because it was
so slow in coming

The last touch only the dot upon an i was wanting A slight change in
the shape or position of the fingers or the length of the shearswhat
was it he wanted How could he sleep that night

He felt that he stood face to face with a difficulty that could have
been easily solved had he come fresh to the work but that his tortured
brain was too worn out to overcome

But when an Arab horse is ready to drop with fatigue then is the time
when it breaks into a gallop

He could not wait There were the faces at the window again staring and
asking Not finished yet Merle the children Uthoug and his wife
the Bank Manager And there were his competitors the world over Today
he was a length ahead of them but by tomorrow he might be left behind
Wait Rest No

It was autumn now and sleepless nights drove him to a doctor who
prescribed cold baths perfect quiet sleeping draughts iron and
arsenic Ah yes Peer could swallow all the prescriptionsthe one
thing he could not do was rest or sleep

He would sit late into the night prostrate with exhaustion watching
the dying embers of the forge the steel the tools And innumerable
sparks would begin to fly before his eyes and masses of molten iron to
creep about like living things over walls and floorAnd over by the
forge was something more defined a misty shape that grew in size and
clearness and stood at last a bearded naked demigod with fire in one
hand and sledgehammer in the other

What Who is that

Man do you not know me

Who are you I ask

I have a thing to tell you it is vain for you to seek for any other
faith than faith in the evolution of the universe It will do no good to
pray You may dream yourself away from the steel and the fire but you
must offer yourself up to them at last You are bound fast to these
things Outside them your soul is nothing God happiness yourself
eternal life for you All these are nothing The will of the world rolls
on towards its eternal goal and the individual is but fuel for the
fire

Peer would spring up believing for a moment that someone was really
there But there was nothing only the empty air

Now and again he would go home to Loreng but everything there seemed to
pass in a mist He could see that Merles eyes were red though she
sang cheerily as she went about the house It seemed to him that she had
begged him to go to bed and rest and he had gone to bed It would be
delicious to sleep But in the middle of the night it was borne in upon
him that the fault lay in the shape of the shears after all and
then there was no stopping him from getting up and hurrying in to the
workshop Winter has come round again and he fights his way in through
a snowstorm And in the quiet night he lights his lamp kindles the
forge fire screws off the blades of the shears once more But when he
has altered them and fixed them in place again he knows at once that
the defect was not in them after all

Coffee is a good thing for keeping the brain clear He took to making it
in the workshop for himselfand at night especially a few cups did him
good They were so satisfying too that he felt no desire for food And
when he came to the conclusion that the best thing would be to make each
separate part of the machine over again anew coffee was great help
keeping him awake through many a long night

It began to dawn upon him that Merle and his fatherinlaw and the Bank
Manager had taken to lurking about the place night and day watching and
spying to see if the work were not nearly done Why in the devils name
could they not leave him in peacejust one week more In any case the
machine could not be tried before next summer At times the workers at
the foundry would be startled by their master suddenly rushing out from
his inner room and crying fiercely No one is to come in here I WILL
be left in peace

And when he had gone in again they would look at each other and shake
their heads

One morning Merle came down and walked through the outer shops and
knocked at the door of her husbands room There was no answer and she
opened the door and went in

A moment after the workmen heard a womans shriek and when they ran in
she was bending over her husband who was seated on the floor staring
up at her with blank uncomprehending eyes

Peer she cried shaking his shoulderPeer do you hear Oh for
Gods sakewhat is it my darling



One April day there was a stir in the little town of Ringeby and
a stream of people all in their best clothes though it was only
Wednesday was moving out along the fjord road to Loreng There were
the two editors who had just settled one of their everlasting disputes
and the two lawyers each still intent on snatching any scraps of
business that offered there were tradesmen and artisans and nearly
everyone was wearing a long overcoat and a grey felt hat But the tanner
had put on a high silk hat so as to look a little taller

Where the road left the wood most of them stopped for a moment to look
up at Loreng The great white house seemed to have set itself high on
its hill to look out far and wide over the lake and the country round
And men talked of the great doings the feasting and magnificence the
great house had seen in days gone by from the time when the place had
been a Governors residence until a few years back when Engineer Holm
was in his glory

But today the place was up to auction with stock and furniture
and people had walked or driven over from far around For the bank
management felt they would not be justified in giving any longer grace
now that Peer Holm was lying sick in hospital and no doctor would
undertake to say whether he would ever be fit to work again

The courtyard was soon crowded Inside in the great hall the
auctioneer was beginning to put up the lots already but most people
hung back a little as if they felt a reluctance to go in For the
air in there seemed charged with lingering memories of splendour and
hospitality from the days when cavaliers with ruffles and golden spurs
had done homage there to ladies in sweeping silk robesdown to the last
gay banquets to which the famous engineer from Egypt had loved to gather
all the gentry round in the days of his prosperity

Most of the people stood on the steps and in the entrancehall And now
and again they would catch a glimpse of a pale woman dressed in black
with thick dark eyebrows crossing the courtyard to a servants house or
a storehouse to give some order for moving the things It was Merle now
mistress here no longer

Old Lorentz D Uthoug met his sister the mighty lady of Bruseth on
the steps She looked at him and there was a gleam of derision in
her narrowed eyes But he drew himself up and said as he passed her
Youve nothing to be afraid of Ive settled things so that Im not
bankrupt yet And you shall have your sharein full

And he strode in a broadshouldered upright figure looking calmly
at all men that all might see he was not the man to be crushed by a
reverse

Late in the day the chestnut Bijou was put up for sale He was led
across the courtyard in a halter and as he came he stopped for a
moment and threw up his head and neighed and from the stables the
other horses neighed in answer Was it a farewell Did he remember
the day years ago when he had come there first dancing on his
whitestockinged feet full of youth and strength

But by the woodshed there stood as usual a little grey old man busy
sawing and chopping as if nothing at all was the matter One master
left another took his place one needed firewood it seemed to him as
much as the other And if they came and gave him noticewhy thank the
Lord he was stone deaf Thud thud the sound of the axe went on

A young man came driving up the hill a floridfaced young man with
very blue eyes He took off his overcoat in the passage revealing a
long black frock coat beneath and a largepatterned waistcoat It was
Uthoug junior general agent for English tweeds He had taken no part
in his brotherinlaws business affairs and so he was able to help his
father in this crisis

But the auction at Loreng went on for several days




BOOK III



Chapter I


Once more a deep valley with sunsteeped farms on the hillsides between
the river and the mountainrange behind

One day about midsummer it was old Raastad himself that came down to
meet the train driving a springcart with a waggon following behind
Was he expecting visitors the people at the station asked him Maybe
I am said old Raastad stroking his heavy beard and he limped about
looking to his horses Was it the folk who had taken the Courthouse
Ay its likely them said the old man

The train came in and a pale man with grey hair and beard and blue
spectacles stepped out and he had a wife and three children with him
Paul Raastad inquired the stranger Ay thats me said the old
man The stranger looked up at the great mountains to the north rising
dizzily into the sky The air ought to be good here said he Ay the
airs good enough by all accounts said Raastad and began loading up
the carts

They drove off up the hill road The man and his wife sat in the
springcart the woman with a child in her lap but a boy and a girl
were seated on the load in the baggagewaggon behind Raastad Can we
see the farm from here asked the woman turning her head There
said the old man pointing And looking they saw a big farmstead high
up on a sunny hillslope close under the crest and near by a long
low house with a steep slate roof the sort of place where the district
officers used to live in old days Is that the house we are to live
in she asked again Ay thats it right enough said old Raastad
and chirruped to his horses

The woman looked long at the farm and sighed So this was to be their
new home They were to live here far from all their friends And
would it give him back his health after all the doctors medicines had
failed

A Lapland dog met them at the gate and barked at them a couple of pigs
came down the road stopped and studied the new arrivals with profound
attention then wheeled suddenly and galloped off among the houses

The farmers wife herself was waiting outside the Courthouse a tall
wrinkled woman with a black cap on her head Welcome she said
offering a rough and bony hand

The house was one of large lowceiled rooms with big stoves that would
need a deal of firewood in winter The furniture was a mixture of every
possible sort and style a mahogany sofa cupboards with painted roses
on the panels chairs covered with Old Norse carving and on the walls
appalling pictures of foreign royal families and of the Crucifixion
Good Heavens said Merle as they went round the rooms alone how
shall we ever get used to all this

But just then Louise came rushing in breathless with news
Motherfatherthere are goats here And little Lorentz came toddling
in after her Goats mother he cried stumbling over the doorstep

The old house had stood empty and dead for years Now it seemed to have
wakened up again Footsteps went in and out and the stairs creaked once
more under the tread of feet small pattering exploring feet and
big feet going about on grownup errands There was movement in every
corner a rattle of pots and pans in the kitchen fires blazed up and
smoke began to rise from the chimney people passing by outside looked
up at it and saw that the dead old house had come to life again

Peer was weak still after his illness but he could help a little with
the unpacking It took very little though to make him out of breath
and giddy and there was a sledgehammer continually thumping somewhere
in the back of his head Supposesuppose after all the change here
does you no good You are at the last stage Youve managed to borrow
the money to keep you all here for a year And then Your wife and
children Hushbetter not think of that Not that think of anything
else only not that

Clothes to be carried upstairs Yes yesand to think it was all to end
in your living on other peoples charity Even that cant go on long If
you should be no better next summeror two years hencewhat then
For yourselfyes theres always one way out for you But Merle and the
children Hush dont think of it Once it was your whole duty to finish
a certain piece of work in a certain time Now it is your duty to get
well again to be as strong as a horse by next year It is your duty If
only the sledgehammer would stop that cursed sledgehammer in the back
of your head

Merle as she went out and in was thinking perhaps of the same thing
but her head was full of so much elsegetting things in order and the
household set going Food had to be bought from the local shop and how
many litres of milk would she require in the morning Where could she
get eggs She must go across at once to the Raastads and ask So the
pale woman in the dark dress walked slowly with bowed head across the
courtyard But when she stopped to speak to people about the place they
would forget their manners and stare at her she smiled so strangely

Father theres a box of starlings on the wall here said Louise as
she lay in bed with her arms round Peers neck saying goodnight And
theres a swallows nest under the eaves too

Oh yes well have great fun at Raastadjust you wait and see

Soon Merle and Peer too lay in their strange beds looking out at the
luminous summer night

They were shipwrecked people washed ashore here But it was not so clear
that they were saved

Peer turned restlessly from side to side He was so worn to skin and
bone that his nerves seemed laid bare and he could not rest in any
position Also there were three hundred wheels whirring in his head and
striking out sparks that flew up and turned to visions

Rest why had he never been content to rest in the days when all went
well

He had made his mark at the First Cataract yes and had made big sums
of money out of his new pump but all the time there were the gnawing
questions Why and whither and what then He had been Chief Engineer
and had built a railway and could have had commissions to build more
railwaysbut again the questions Why and what then Home then home
and strike root in his native landwell and had that brought him rest
What was it that drove him away again The steel the steel and the
fire

Ah that day when he had stepped down from the mowing machine and had
been ensnared by the idea of improving it Why had he ever taken it
up Did he need money No Or was the work at a standstill No But the
steel would on it had need of a man it had taken him by the throat and
said You shall

Happiness Rest Ah no For you see a storedup mass of knowledge and
experience turns one fine day into an army of evil powers that lash
you on and on unceasingly You may stumble you may fallwhat does
it matter The steel squeezes one man dry and then grips the next The
flame of the world has need of fuelbow thy head Man and leap into
the fire

Today you prospertomorrow you are cast down into a hell on earth
What matter You are fuel for the fire

But I will not I will not be swallowed up in the flame of the world
even though it be the only godhead in the universe I will tear myself
loose be something in and for myself I will have an immortal soul
The worldtransformation that progress may have wrought a thousand years
hencewhat is it to me

Your soul Just think of all your noble feelings towards that trueborn
halfbrother of yourshahaha Shakespeare was wrong Its the bastard
that gets cheated

Dearest Peer do for Gods sake try to get to sleep

Oh yes Ill get to sleep all right But its so hot He threw off the
clothes and lay breathing heavily

Im sure youre lying thinking and brooding over things Cant you do
what the Swedish doctor told youjust try to think that everything is
dark all round you

Peer turns round and everything around him is dark But in the heart of
that darkness waves arise waves of melody rolling nearer nearer
It is the sound of a hymnit is Louise standing playing his sister
Louise And what peaceO God what peace and rest

But soon Louise fades away she fades away and vanishes like a flame
blown out And there comes a roaring noise nearer and nearer grinding
crashing rattlingand he knows now what it is only too well it is the
song of the steel

The roar of steel from ships and from railwaytrains with their pairs
of yellow evil eyes rushing on full of human captives whither
Faster fasterdriven by competition by the steel demon that hunts men
on without rest or respitethat hurries on the pulse of the world to
fever to hallucination to madness

Crashing of steel girders falling the hum of wheels the clash of
cranes and winches and chains the clang of steamhammers at workall
are in that roar The fire flares up with hellish eyes in every dark
corner and men swarm around in the red glow like evil angels They are
the slaves of steel and fire lashed onwards never resting

Is this the spirit of Prometheus Look the will of steel is flinging
men up into the air now It is conquering the heavens Why That it may
rush the faster It craves for yet more speed quicker quicker dizzier
yet hurryingwhereforewhither Alas it knows not itself

Are the children of the earth grown so homeless Do they fear to take a
moments rest Do they dread to look inward and see their own emptiness
Are they longing for something they have lostsome hymn some harmony
some God

God They find a bloodthirsty Jehovah and an ascetic on the cross What
gods are these for modern men Religious history not religion

Peer says Merle again for Gods sake try to sleep

Merle do you think I shall get well here

Why dont you feel already how splendid the air is Of course youll
get well

He twined his fingers into hers and at last the sound of Louises hymn
came to him once more lifting and rocking him gently till his eyes
closed



Chapter II


A little road winds in among the woods two wheeltracks only with a
carpet of brown pineneedles between but there are trees and the sky
quiet and peace so that its a real blessing to walk there It rises
and falls so gently that no one need get out of breath indeed
it seems to go along with one all the time in mere friendliness
whispering Take it easy Take your time Have a good rest here And
so on it goes winding in among the treetrunks slender and supple as a
young girl

Peer walked here every day He would stop and look up into the tops of
the fir trees and walk on again then sit down for a moment on a mossy
stone but only for a momentalways he was up again soon and moving on
though he had nowhere to go But at least there was peace here He would
linger watching an insect as it crept along a fir branch or listening
to the murmur of the river in the valley far below or breathing in the
healthgiving scent of the resin thick in the warm air

This present life of his was one way of living As he lay after a
sleepless night watching the window grow lighter with the dawn he
would think Yet another new dayand nothing that I can do in it

And yet he had to get up and dress and go down and eat His bread had
a slightly bitter taste to himit tasted of charity and dependence of
the rich widow at Bruseth and the agent for English tweeds And he must
remember to eat slowly to masticate each mouthful carefully to rest
after meals and above all not to thinknot to think of anything in the
wide world Afterwards he could go out and in like other people only
that all his movements and actions were useless and meaningless in
themselves they were done only for the sake of health or to keep
thoughts away or to make the time go by

How had this come to pass He found it still impossible to grasp how
such senseless things can happen and no Providence interfere to set them
right Why should he have been so suddenly doomed to destruction
Days weeks and months of his best manhood oozing away into empty
nothingnesswhy Sleeplessness and tortured nerves drove him to do
things that his will disowned he would storm at his wife and children
if a heel so much as scraped on the floor and the remorse that
followed sometimes ending in childish tears did no good for the next
time the same thing or worse would happen again This was the burden
of his days This was the life he was doomed to live

But up here on the little forest track he harms no one and no racking
noises come thrusting sharp knives into his spine Here is a great
peace a peace that does a man good Down on the grassy slope below
stands a tumbledown grey barn it reminds him of an old wornout horse
lifting its head from grazing to gaze at youa lonely forsaken creature
it seemstomorrow it will sink to the ground and rise no moreyet IT
takes its lot calmly and patiently

Ugh how far he has got from Raastad A cold sweat breaks out over his
body for fear he may not have strength to walk back again uphill Well
pull yourself together Rest a little And he lies down on his back in a
field of clover and stares up at the sky

A stream of clean air fresh from the snow flows all day long down the
valley as if Jotunheim itself where it lies in there beneath the sky
were breathing in easy wellbeing Peer fills his lungs again and again
with long deep draughts drinking in the air like a saving potion Help
me then oh air light solitude help me that I may be whole once more
and fit to work for this is the one and only religion left me to cling
to

High above over the two mountain ranges a blue flood stands immovable
and in its depths eternal rest is brooding But is there a will there
too that is concerned with men on earth You do not believe in it and
yet a little prayer mounts up to it as well Help methou too Who
Thou that hearest If Thou care at all for the miserable things called
men that crawl upon the earthhelp me If I once prayed for a great
work that could stay my hunger for things eternal I repent me now
and confess that it was pride and vanity Make me a slave toiling at
servile tasks for food so that Merle and the children be not taken from
me Hearest Thou

Does anyone in heaven find comfort in seeing men tortured by blind
fortune Are my wife and my children slaves of an unmeaning chanceand
yet can smile and laugh Answer me if Thou hearestThou of the many
names

A grasshopper is shrilling in the grass about him Suddenly he starts up
sitting A railwaytrain goes screaming past below

And so the days go on

Each morning Merle would steal a glance at her husbands face to see
if he had slept if his eyes were dull or inflamed or calm Surely he
must be better soon Surely their stay here must do him good She
too had lost faith in medicines but this air the country life the
solituderest restsurely there must soon be some sign that these
were helping him

Many a time she rose in the morning without having closed her eyes all
night But there were the children to look after the house to see to
and she had made up her mind to get on without a maid if she possibly
could

What has taken you over to the farm so much lately she asked one day
You have been sitting over there with old Raastad for hours together

II go over to amuse myself and pass the time he said

Do you talk politics

Nowe play cards Why do you look at me like that

You never cared for cards before

No but what the devil am I to do I cant read because of these
cursed eyes of mineand the hammering in my head    And Ive
counted all the farms up and down the valley now There are fifty in
all And on the farm here there are just twentyone houses big and
little What the devil am I to take to next

Merle sighed It is hard she said But couldnt you wait till the
evening to play cardstill the children are in bedthen I could play
with you That would be better

Thank you very much But what about the rest of the day Do you know
what its like to go about from dawn to dark feeling that every minute
is wasted and wasted for nothing No you cant know it What am I
to do with myself all through one of these endless deadly days Drink
myself drunk

Couldnt you try cutting firewood for a little

Firewood He whistled softly Well thats an idea Yeyes Lets
try chopping firewood for a change

Thud thud thud

But as he straightened his back for a breathingspace the whirr whirr
of Raastads mowing machine came to him from the hillslope near by
where it was working and he clenched his teeth as if they ached He
was driving a mowing machine of his own invention and it was raining
continually and the grass kept sticking stickingand how to put it
rightput it right It was as if blows were falling on festering wounds
in his head making him dance with pain Thud thud thudanything to
drown the whirr of that machine

But a man may use an axe with his hands and yet have idiotic fancies
all the time bubbling and seething in his head The power to hold in
check the vagaries of imagination may be gone From all sides they come
creeping out in swarms they swoop down on him like birds of preyas if
in revenge for having been driven away so often beforethey cry here
we are He stood once more as an apprentice in the mechanical works
riveting the plates of a gigantic boiler with a compressedair
tubecling clang The wailing clang of the boiler went out over
the whole town And now that same boiler is set up inside his
headclingclangugh A cold sweat breaks out upon his body he throws
down the axe he must gomust fly escape somewherewhere he cannot
tell Faces that he hates to think of peer out at him from every corner
yapping out Hehwhat did we say Today a beggartomorrow a madman
in a cell

But it may happen too that help comes in the night Things come back
to a man that it is good to remember That timeand that other    A
woman thereand the one you met in such a place There is a picture
in the Louvre by Veronese a young Venetian woman steps out upon the
marble stairway of a palace holding a goldenhaired boy by the hand
she is dressed in black velvet she glows with youth and happiness A
lovers meeting in her garden The first kiss Moonlight and mandolins

A shudder of pleasure passes through his weary body Bright
recollections and impressions flock towards him like spirits of
lighthe can hear the rushing sound of their wingshe calls to them
for aid and they encircle him round they struggle with the spirits of
darkness for his soul He has known much brightness much beauty in his
lifesurely the bright angels are the stronger and must conquer Ah
why had he not lived royally amidst women and flowers and wine

One morning as he was getting up he said Merle I must and will hit
upon something thatll send me to bed thoroughly tired out

Yes dear she answered Do try

Ill try wheeling stones to begin with he said The devils in it if
a day at that doesnt make a man sleep

So that day and for many days he wheeled stones from some newly broken
land on the hillside down to a dyke that ran along the road

Calm golden autumn days one farm above another rising up towards the
crest of the range all set in ripe yellow fields One little cottage
stands right on the crest against the sky itself and it too has its
tiny patch of yellow corn And an eagle sails slowly across the deep
valley from peak to peak

People passing by stared at Peer as he went about bareheaded in his
shirtsleeves wheeling stones Aye gentlefolks have queer notions
they would say shaking their heads

Thats itkeep at it a dry hacking voice kept going in Peers head
It is idiocy but you are doomed to it Shove hard with those skinny
legs of yours many a jade before you has had to do the same Youve got
to get some sleep tonight Only ten months left now and then we shall
have Lucifer turning up at the crossroads once more Poor Merleshes
beginning to grow grey And the poor little childrendreaming of father
beating them maybe they cry out so often in their sleep Off now
trundle away Now over with that load and back for another

You that once looked down on the soulless toil for bread you have
sunk now to something far more miserable You are dragging at a load
of sheer stupidity You are a galleyslave with calamity for your
taskmaster As you move the chains rattle And that is your day

He straightens himself up wipes the sweat from his forehead and begins
heaving up stones into his barrow again

How long must it last this life in manacles Do you remember Job
Job Aye doubtless Jehovah was sitting at some jovial feast when he
conceived that fantasy of a drunken brain to let Satan loose upon a
happy man Job His seven sons and daughters and his cattle and his
calves were restored unto him but we read nothing of any compensation
made him for the jest itself He was made to play court fool with his
boils and his tortures and his misery and the gods had their bit
of sport gratis Job had his actual outlay in cattle and offspring
refunded and that was all Haha

Prometheus Is it you after all that are the friend of man among the
gods Have you indeed the power to free us all some day When will you
come then to raise the great revolt

Come comeup with the barrow againyou see it is full

Father its dinnertime Come along home cries little Louise racing
down the hill with her yellow plaits flying about her ears But she
stops cautiously a little distance offthere is no knowing what sort of
temper father may be in

Thanks little monkey Got anything good for dinner today

Aha thats a secret said the girl in a teasing voice she was
beaming now with delight at finding him approachable Catch me
father I can run quicker than you can

Im afraid Im too tired just now my little girl

Oh poor papa are you tired And she came up and took him by the
hand Then she slipped her arm into hisit was just as good fun to walk
up the hill on her fathers arm like a grownup young lady

Then came the frosts And one morning the hilltops were turned into
leaden grey clouds from which the snow came sweeping down Merle stood
at the window her face grey in the clammy light She looked down the
valley to where the mountains closed it in it seemed still narrower
than before ones breath came heavily and ones mind seemed stifled
under cold damp wrappings

Ugh Better go out into the kitchen and set to work againworkwork
and forget

Then one day there came a letter telling her that her mother was dead



Chapter III


DEAR KLAUS BROCK

Legendary being Cast down from Khedivial heights one day and up again
on high with Kitchener the next But in Heavens name what has taken
you to the Soudan What made you go and risk your life at Omdurman The
same old desperation I suppose that youre always complaining about
And why of all things plant yourself away in an outpost on the edge
of the wilderness to lie awake at nights nursing suicidal thoughts over
Schopenhauer You have lived without principles you say And wasted
your youth And are homeless now all round with no morals no country
no religion But will you make all this better by making things much
worse

Youve no reason to envy me my country life by the way and theres
no sense in your going about longing for the little church of your
childhood with its Moses and hymns and God Well longing does no harm
perhaps but dont ever try to find it The fact is old fellow that
such things are not to be found any more

I take it that religion had the same power on you in your childhood
as it had with me We were wild young scamps both of us but we liked
going to church not for the sake of the sermons but to bow our heads
when the hymn arose and join in singing it When the waves of the
organmusic rolled through the church it seemedto me at leastas if
something were set swelling in my own soul bearing me away to lands
and kingdoms where all at last was as it should be And when we went out
into the world we went with some echo of the hymn in our hearts and we
might curse Jehovah but in a corner of our minds the hymn lived on as
a craving a hunger for some worldharmony All through the busy day
we might bear our part in the roaring song of the steel but in the
evenings on our lonely couch another power would come forth in our
minds the hunger for the infinite the longing to be cradled and borne
up on the waves of eternity whose way is past all finding out

Never believe though that youll find the church of your childhood
now in any of our country places We have electric light now everywhere
telephones separators labour unions and political meetings but the
church stands empty I have been there The organ wails as if it had the
toothache the precentor sneezes out a hymn the congregation does not
lift the roof off with its voice for the very good reason that there
is no congregation there And the priest poor devil stands up in his
pulpit with his black moustache and pincenez he is an officer in
the army reserve and he reads out his highly rational remarks from a
manuscript But his face says all the timeYou two paupers down there
that make up my congregation you dont believe a word I am saying
but never mind I dont believe it either Its a tragic business when
people have outgrown their own conception of the divine And wewe
are certainly better than Jehovah The dogma of the atonement based
on original sin and the bloodthirstiness of God is revolting to us we
shrug our shoulders and turn away with a smile or in disgust We are
not angels yet but we are too good to worship such a God as that

There is some excuse for the priest of course He must preach of some
God And he has no other

Altogether its hardly surprising that even ignorant peasants shake
their heads and give the church a wide berth What do they do on
Sundays then My dear fellow they have no Sunday They sit nodding
their heads over a long table waiting for the day to pass They remind
one of plough horses that have filled their bellies and stand snoring
softly because theres no work today

The great evolutionary scheme with its wonders of steel and miracles of
science goes marching on victoriously I grant you changing the face
of the world hurrying its pulse to a more and more feverish beat But
what good will it do the peasant to be able to fly through the air on
his wheelbarrow while no temple no holy day is left him any more on
earth What errand can he have up among the clouds while yet no heaven
arches above his soul

This is the burning question with all of us with you in the desert as
with us up here under the Pole To me it seems that we need One who will
make our religion newnot merely a new prophet but a new God

You ask about my healthwell I fancy its too early yet to speak about
it But so much I will say If you should ever be in pain and suffering
take it out on yourselfnot on others

Greetings from us all

Yours

PEER DALESMAN



Chapter IV


Christmas was near the days were all grey twilight and there was a
frost that set the walltimbers cracking The children went about
blue with cold When Merle scrubbed the floors they turned into small
skatingrinks though there might be a big fire in the stove Peer waded
and waded through deep snow to the well for water and his beard hung
like a wreath of icicles about his face

Aye this was a winter

Old Raastads two daughters were in the dairy making wheycheese The
door was flung open there was a rush of frosty air and Peer stood
there blinking his eyes

Huh what smokers you two are

Are we now And the redhaired one and the fairhaired one both
giggled and they looked at each other and nodded This queer
townsmanlodger of theirs never came near them that he didnt crack
jokes

By the way Else I dreamed last night that we were going to be
married

Both the girls shrieked with delight at this

And Mari you were married to the bailiff

Oh my That old creature down at Moen

He was much older Ninety years old he was

Ufyoure always at your nonsense said the redhaired girl
stirring away at her huge steaming cauldron

Peer went out again The girls were hardly out of their teens and yet
their faces seemed set already and stiff with earnestness And whenever
Peer had managed to set them laughing unawares they seemed frightened
the next minute at having been betrayed into doing something there was
no profit in

Peer strode about in the crackling snow with his fur cap drawn down over
his ears Jotunheim itself lay there up north breathing an icyblue
cold out over the world

And he Was he to go on like this growing hunchbacked under a burden
that weighed and bowed him down continually Why the devil could he not
shake it off break away from it and kick out bravely at his evil fate

Peer asked Merle standing in the kitchen what did you think of
giving the children for a Christmas present

Oh a palace each and a horse to ride of course When youve more
money than you know what to do with the devil take economy And what
about you my girl Any objection to a couple of thousand crowns worth
of furs

No but seriously The children havent any skinor a handsleigh

Well have you the money to buy them I havent

Suppose you tried making them yourself

Ski Peer turned over the notion whistling Well why not And a
sleigh We might manage that But what about little Astashes too
little for that sort of thing

She hasnt any bed for her doll

Peer whistled again Theres something in that Thats an idea Im not
so handless yet that I couldnt

He was soon hard at it There were tools and a joiners bench in an
outhouse and there he worked He grew easily tired his feet tried
constantly to take him to the door but he forced himself to go on Is
there anything in the notion that a man can get well by simply willing
it I will will will The thought of others besides himself began to
get the upper hand of those birds of prey ravening in his head Presents
for the children presents that father had made himselfthe picture
made light and warmth in his mind Drive ahead then

When it came to making the iron ribbons for the sleigh runners he had
to go across to the smithy and there stood a cottar at work roughing
horseshoes Red glowing iron once more and steel The clang of hammer
on anvil seemed to tear his ears yet it drew him on too It was long
since last he heard that sound And there were memories

Want this welded Jens Wheres the borax Look here this is the way
of it

Might ha been born and bred a smith said Jens as he watched the
deft and easy hammerstrokes

Christmas Eve came and the grey farmpony dragged up a big wooden case
to the door Peer opened it and carried in the thingsa whole heap of
good things for Christmas from the Ringeby relations

He bit his lips when he saw all the bags piled up on the kitchen table
There had been a time not long ago when Merle and he had loaded up a
sledge at the Loreng storehouse and driven off with Christmas gifts to
all the poor folk round It was part of the seasons fun for them And
nownow they must even be glad to receive presents themselves

Merlehave WE nothing we can give away this year

I dont know What do you think

A poor mans Christmas itll be with a vengeanceif were only to take
presents and havent the least little thing to give away

Merle sighed We must hope it wont happen to us again she said

I wont have it happen to us now he said pacing up and down
Theres that poor devil of a joiner down at Moen with consumption Im
going down there with a bit of a parcel to chuck in at his door if I
have to take your shift and the shirt off my back You know yourself it
wont be any Christmas at all if we dont do something

Wellif you like Ill see if we cant find something among the
childrens clothes that they can do without

The end of it was that Merle levied toll on all the parcels from home
both rice and raisins and cakes and made up little packets of them to
send round by him That was Merles way let her alone and she would hit
upon something

The snow creaked and crackled underfoot as Peer went off on his errand
A starry sky and a biting wind and light upon light from the windows of
the farms scattered over the dark hillsides High above all against the
sky there was one little gleam that might be a cottage window or might
be a star

Peer was flushed and freshened up when he came back into the warmth of
the room And a chorus of joyful shouts was raised when Merle announced
to the children Fathers going to bath you all tonight

The sawedoff end of a barrel was the bathingtub and Peer stood in the
kitchen with his sleeves rolled up holding the naked little bodies as
they sprawled about in the steaming water

Mother was busy with something or other in the sittingroom But it was
a great secret and the children were very mysterious about it No no
you mustnt go in they said to little Asta who went whimpering for
her mother to the door

And later in the evening when the Christmastree was lit up and the
windows shone white with frost there were great doings all about the
sitting room floor Louise got her ski on and immediately fell on her
face Lorentz astride of the new sleigh was shouting Hi hiclear
the course there and over in a corner sat little Asta busy putting
her baby to bed and singing it to sleep

Husband and wife looked at each other and smiled

What did I tell you said Merle


Slowly with torturing slowness the leadengrey winter days creep by
For two hours in the middle of the day there is pale twilightfor two
hoursthen darkness again Through the long nights the north wind howls
funeral dirgeshuuuuand piles up the snow into great drifts across
the road deep enough almost to smother a sleigh and its driver The
days and nights come and go monotonous unchanged the same icy grey
daylight and never a human soul to speak to Across the valley a great
solid mountain wall hems you in and you gaze at it till it nearly
drives you mad If only one could bore a hole through it and steal a
glimpse of the world beyond or could climb up to the topmost ridge and
for a moment look far round to a wide horizon and breathe freely once
more

At last one day the grey veil lifts a little A strip of blue sky
appearsand hearts grow lighter at the sight The snow peaks to the
south turn golden What Is it actually the sun And day by day now a
belt of gold grows broader comes lower and lower on the hillside till
the highestlying farms are steeped in it and glow red And at last one
day the red flame reaches the Courthouse and shines in across the floor
of the room where Merle is sitting by the window patching the seat of a
tiny pair of trousers

What life and cheer it brings with it

Motherheres the sun cries Louise joyfully from the doorway

Yes child I see it

But Louise has only looked in for a moment to beg some cake for Lorentz
and herself and be off again on her ski to the hillslopes Thank you
motheryoure a darling And with a slice in each hand she dashes out
glowing with health and the cold air

If only Peer could glow with health again But though one day they might
persuade themselves that nownow at last he had turned the cornerthe
next he would be lying tossing about in misery and it all seemed
more hopeless than ever He had taken to the doctors medicines
againarsenic and iron and so forthand the quiet and fresh air they
had prescribed were here in plenty would nothing do him any good There
were not so many months of their year left now

And then Another winter here And living on charityah me Merle shook
her head and sighed

The time had come too when Louise should go to school

Send the children over to meall three of them if you like wrote
Aunt Marit from Bruseth No thanks Merle knew what that meant Aunt
Marit wanted to keep them for good

Lose her childrengive away her children to others Was the day to come
when that burden too would be laid upon them

But schooling they must have they must learn enough at least to fit
them to make a living when they grew up And if their own parents could
not afford them schooling whywhy then perhaps they had no right to
keep them

Merle sewed and sewed on lifting her head now and again so that the
sunlight fell on her face

How the snow shonelike purple under the red flood of sunlight After
all their troubles seemed a little easier to bear today It was as if
something frozen in her heart were beginning to thaw

Louise was getting on well with her violin Perhaps one day the child
might go out into the world and win the triumphs that her mother had
dreamed of in vain

There was a sound of hurried steps in the passage and she started and
sat in suspense Would he come in raging or in despair or had the
pains in his head come back The door opened

Merle I have it now By all the gods little woman somethings
happened at last

Merle half rose from her seat but sank back again gazing at his face

Ive got it this time Merle he said again And how on earth I never
hit on it beforewhen its as simple as shelling peas

He was stalking about the room now with his hands in his pockets
whistling

But what is it Peer

Why you see I was standing there chopping wood And all the time
swarms of mowing machinesnine million of themwere going in my head
all with the grass sticking fast to the shears and clogging them up I
was in a cold sweatI felt myself going straight to helland then
in a flasha flash of steelit came to me It means salvation for us
Merle salvation

Oh do talk so that I can understand a little of what youre saying

Why dont you seeall thats wanted is a small movable steel brush
above the shears to flick away the grass and keep them clear Hang it
all a child could see it By Jove little woman itll soon be changed
times with us now

Merle laid her work down in her lap and let her hands fall If this were
true

Ill have the machine up here Merle Making the brushes and fixing
them on will be no trouble at allI can do it in a day in the smithy
here

Whatyou had better try Youre just beginning to get a little better
and you want to spoil it all again

I shall never get well Merle as long as I have that infernal machine
in my head balancing between worldsuccess and fiasco It presses on my
brain like a leaden weight I shall never have a decent nights sleep
till I get rid of it Oh my great Godif times were to change some
dayeven for us Well Do you think I wouldnt get well when that day
came

This time she let him take her in his arms But when he had gone she
sat still watching the sun sink behind the snowranges till her eyes
grew dim and her breath came heavily

A week later when the sun was flaming on the white roofs the grey pony
dragged a huge packingcase up to Raastad And the same day a noise of
hammer and file at work was heard in the smithy

What do a few sleepless nights matter now And they are sleepless not so
much from anxietyfor this time things go wellas because of dreams
And both of them dream They have bought back Loreng and they wander
about through the great light rooms once more and all is peace and
happiness All the evil days before are as a nightmare that is past
Once more they will be young go out on ski together and dine together
after and drink champagne and look at each other with love in their
eyes Once moreand many times again

Goodnight Merle

Goodnight Peer and sleep well

Day after day the hammering went on in the smithy

A few years back he could have finished the whole business in a couple
of days But now half an hours work was enough to tire him out It is
exhausting work to concentrate your thoughts upon a single point when
your brain has long been used to play idly with stray fancies as they
came He found too that there were defects to be put right in the
parts he thought were complete before and he had no assistants now no
foundry to get castings from he must forge out each piece with his own
hands and with sorry tools

What did it matter

He began to discipline his brain denying himself every superfluous
thought He drew dark curtains across every window in his consciousness
save onethe machine After half an hours work he would go back to bed
and restjust close his eyes and rest This too was discipline Again
he flooded all his mind with darkness darkness to save his strength
for the halfhour of work next day

Was Merle fearful and anxious At all events she said no word about the
work that so absorbed him He was excited enough as it was And now when
he was irritable and angry with the children she did not even look
at him reproachfully They must bear it both she and the childrenit
would soon be all over now

In the clear moonlight nights when the children were in bed the two
would sometimes be seen wandering about together They went with their
arms about each others waists talking loudly laughing a great deal
and sometimes singing People going by on the road would hear the
laughter and singing and think to themselves Its either someone
thats been drinking or else that couple from the Courthouse

The spring drew on and the days grew lighter


But at the Hamar Agricultural Exhibition where the machine was tried
an American competitor was found to be just a little better Everyone
thought it a queer business for even if the idea hadnt been directly
stolen from Peer there could be no doubt that his machine had suggested
it The principles adopted were the same in both cases but in the
American machine there was just enough improvement in carrying them out
to make it doubtful whether it would be any use going to law over the
patent rights And besidesits no light matter for a man with no money
at his back to go to law with a rich American firm

In the mighty race with competitors the wide world over to produce the
best machine Peer had been on the very point of winning Another man
had climbed upon his chariot and then at the last moment jumped a few
feet ahead and had thereby won the prize

So that the achievement in itself be good the world does not inquire
too curiously whether it was honestly achieved

And there is no use starting a jointstock company to exploit a new
machine when there is a better machine in the field

The steel had seized on Peer and used him as a springboard But the
reward was destined for another

Herr Uthoug Junior Agent for English tweeds stepped out of the train
one warm day in July and stood for a moment on the station platform
looking about him Magnificent scenery certainly And this beautiful
valley was where his sister had been living for more than a year
Splendid airand yet somehow it didnt seem to have done his
brotherinlaw much good Well well And the neatly dressed young
gentleman set off on foot towards Raastad asking his way from time
to time He wanted to take them by surprise There had been a family
council at Ringeby and they had agreed that some definite arrangement
must be made for the future of the sister and her husband with whom
things had gone so hopelessly wrong

As he turned up the byroad that led to the farm he was aware of a
man in his shirtsleeves wheeling a barrow full of stones What He
thoughtcould he be mistaken Nosure enough it was Peer HolmPeer
Holm loading up stones and wheeling them down the hill as zealously as
if he were paid for every step

The Agent was not the man for lamentations or condolences Hullo he
cried Hard at it arent you Youve taken to farming I see

Peer stood up straight wiped his hands on his trousers and came
towards him Good heavens how old he has grown thought Uthoug to
himself But aloud he said Well you do look fit Id hardly have
known you again

Merle caught sight of the pair from the kitchen window Why I do
believe she exclaimed and came running out It was so long since she
had seen any of her people that she forgot her dignity and in a moment
had her arms round her brothers neck hugging him

No certainly Uthoug junior had not come with lamentations and
condolences He had a bottle of good wine in his bag and at supper he
filled the glasses and drank with them both and talked about theatres
and variety shows and gave imitations of wellknown actors till he had
set the two poor harassed creatures laughing They must need a little
joy and laughterah well he knew how they must need it

But he knew too that Merle and Peer were on tenterhooks waiting to
know what the family had decided about their future The days of their
life here had been evil and sad but they only hoped now that they might
be able to stay on If the help they had received up to now were taken
from them they could neither afford to stay here nor to go elsewhere
What then could they do No wonder they were anxious as they sat there

After supper he went out for a stroll with Peer while Merle waited at
home in suspense She understood that their fate was being settled as
she waited

At last they returnedand to her astonishment they came in laughing

Her brother said goodnight and kissed her on the forehead and patted
her arm and was kindness itself She took him up to his room and would
have liked to sit there a while and talk to him but she knew Peer had
waited till they were alone to tell her the news that concerned them so
nearly Goodnight then Carsten she said to her brother and went
downstairs

And then at last she and Peer were sitting alone together at her
worktable by the window

Well said Merle

The thing is this Merle If we have courage to live at all we must
look facts in the face as they are

Yes dear but tell me   

And the facts are that with my health as it now is I cannot possibly
get any employment It is certain that I cannot And as that is the
case we may as well be here as anywhere else

But can we stay on here Peer

If you can bear to stay with a miserable bungler like methat of
course is a question

Answer mecan we stay here

Yes But it may be years Merle before Im fit to work againweve
got to reckon with that And to live on charity year after year is what
I cannot and will not endure

But what are we to do then Peer There seems to be no possible way
for me to earn any money

I can try at any rate he answered looking out of the window

You Oh no Peer Even if you could get work as a draughtsman you know
quite well that your eyes would never stand   

I can do blacksmiths work he said

There was a pause Merle glanced at him involuntarily as if she could
hardly believe her ears Could he be in earnest Was the engineer of the
Nile Barrage to sink into a country blacksmith

She sighed But she felt she must not dishearten him And at last she
said with an effort It would help to pass the time I daresay And
perhaps you would get into the way of sleeping better She looked out
of the window with tightly compressed lips

And if I do that Merle we cant stay on in this house In fact a
great box of a place like this is too big for us in any casewhen you
havent even a maid to help you

But do you know of any smaller house we could take

Yes theres a little place for sale with a rood or two of ground If
we had a cow and a pig Merleand a few fowlsand could raise a
bushel or two of cornand if I could earn a few shillings a week in the
smithywe wouldnt come on the parish at any rate I could manage the
little jobs that Id getin fact pottering about at them would do me
good What do you say

Merle did not answer her eyes were turned away gazing fixedly out of
the window

But theres another questionabout you Merle Are you willing to sink
along with me into a life like that I shall be all right I lived in
just such a place when I was a boy But you Honestly Merle I dont
think I should ask it of you His voice began to tremble he pressed
his lips together and his eyes avoided her face

There was a pause How about the money she said at last How will
you buy the place

Your brother has promised to arrange about a loan But I say again
MerleI shall not blame you in the least if you would rather go and
live with your aunt at Bruseth I fancy shed be glad to have you and
the children too

Again there was silence for a while Then she said If there are two
decent rooms in the cottage we could be comfortable enough And as you
say it would be easier to look after

Peer waited a little There was something in his throat that prevented
speech He understood now that it was to be taken for granted without
words that they should not part company And it took him a little time
to get over the discovery

Merle sat facing him but her eyes were turned to the window as before
She had still the same beautiful dark eyebrows but her face was faded
and worn and there were streaks of grey in her hair

At last he spoke again And about the children Merle

She started The childrenwhat about them Had it come at last the
thing she had gone in fear of so long

Aunt Marit has sent word to ask if we will let your brother take Louise
over to stay with her

No Merle flung out No Peer Surely you said no at once Surely you
wouldnt let her go You know what it means their wanting to have her
over there

I know he nodded But theres another question in Louises own
interest have we any right to say no

Peer she cried springing up and wringing her hands you mustnt ask
it of me You dont want to do it yourself Surely we have not come to
thatto begin sendinggiving awayno no no she moaned Do you
hear me Peer I cannot do it

As you please Merle he said rising and forcing himself to speak
calmly We can think it over at any rate till your brother leaves
tomorrow There are two sides to the thing one way of it may hurt us
now the other way may be a very serious matter for Louise poor thing

Next morning when it was time to wake the children Peer and Merle
went into the nursery together They stopped by Louises bed and stood
looking down at her The child had grown a great deal since they came
to Raastad she lay now with her nose buried in the pillow and the fair
hair hiding her cheek She slept so soundly and securely This was home
to her still she was safer with father and mother than anywhere else in
the world

Louise said Merle shaking her Time to get up dear

The child sat up still half asleep and looked wonderingly at the two
faces What was it

Make haste and get dressed said Peer Fancy Youre going off with
Uncle Carsten today to see Aunt Marit at Bruseth What do you say to
that

The little girl was wide awake in a moment and hopped out of bed at
once to begin dressing But there was something in her parents faces
which a little subdued her joy

That morning there was much whispering among the children The two
youngest looked with wondering eyes at their elder sister who was going
away Little Lorentz gave her his horse as a keepsake and Asta gave her
youngest doll And Merle went about trying to make believe that Louise
was only going on a short visit and would soon be coming back

By dinnertime they had packed a little trunk and Louise in her
best dress was rushing about saying goodbye all round the farm the
harvesters whom she had helped to drive in the hay coming in for a
specially affectionate farewell Her last visit was to Musin the grey
horse that was grazing tethered behind the smithy Musin was busy
cropping the turf but he just lifted his head and looked at hershe
plucked a handful of grass and offered it and when he had disposed of
that she patted his muzzle and he let her cling round his neck for a
moment

Ill be sure to write she cried out to no one in particular as she
went back over the courtyard again

The train moved out of the station taking with it Uthoug junior and
Louise each waving from one of the windows of the compartment

And Peer and Merle were left on the platform holding their two youngest
children by the hand They could still see a small hand with a white
handkerchief waving from the carriage window Then the last carriage
disappeared into the cutting and the smoke and the rumble of the train
were all that was left

The four that were left behind stood still for a little while but they
seemed to have moved unconsciously closer together than before



Chapter VI


Some way up from the highroad there stands a little onestoreyed house
with three small windows in a row a cowshed on one side of it and a
smithy on the other When smoke rises from the smithy the neighbours
say The engineer must be a bit better today since hes at it in the
smithy again If theres anything you want done youd better take it to
him He doesnt charge any more than Jens up at Lia

Merle and Peer had been living here a couple of years Their lives had
gone on together but there had come to be this difference between them
Merle still looked constantly at her husbands face always hoping that
he would get better while he himself had no longer any hope Even
when the thump thumping in his head was quiet for a time there was
generally some trouble somewhere to keep him on the rack only he did
not talk about it any more He looked at his wifes face and thought
to himself She is changing more and more and it is you that are to
blame You have poured out your own misery on her day and night It is
time now you tried to make some amends So had begun a struggle to keep
silence to endure if possible to laugh even when he could have found
it in his heart to weep It was difficult enough especially at first
but each victory gained brought with it a certain satisfaction which
strengthened him to take up the struggle again

In this way too he learned to look on his fate more calmly His humour
grew lighter it was as if he drew himself up and looked misfortune in
the eyes saying Yes I know I am defenceless and you can plunge me
deeper and deeper yet but for all that if I choose to laugh you cannot
hinder me

How much easier all things seemed now that he looked no longer for any
good to come to him and urged no claims against anyone either in heaven
or on earth But when he was tired out with his work at the forge there
was a satisfaction in saying to his wife No Merle didnt I tell
you I wouldnt have you carrying the water up Give me the bucket
Youyou look fit for it dont you Hang it all am I a man or am
I not Get back to your kitchenthats the place for a woman So he
carried water and his mood was the brighter for it though he might
feel at times as if his back were breaking And sometimes Im feeling
lazy today Merle he would say If you dont mind Ill stay in bed
a bit longer And she understood She knew from experience that these
were the days when his nightmare headache was upon him and that it was
to spare her he called it laziness

They had a cow now and a pig and some fowls It was not exactly on the
same scale as at Loreng but it had the advantage that he could manage
it all himself Last year they had raised so many potatoes that they had
been able to sell a few bushels They did not buy eggs any morethey
sold them Peer carried them down himself to the local dealer sold them
at market price and bought things they might need with the money Why
not Merle did not think it beneath her to wash and scrub and do the
cooking True enough things had been different with them once but it
was only Merle now who ever had moments of dreaming that the old days
might come back Otherwise for both him and her it was as if they had
been washed ashore on a barren coast and must try to live through the
grey days as best they could

It would happen once in a while that a mowing machine of the new
American type would be sent in by some farmer to the smithy for repairs
When this happened Peer would shut his lips close with a queer
expression look at the machine for a moment and swallow something in
his throat The man who had stolen this thing from him and bettered it
by a hairsbreadth was doubtless a millionaire by now on the strength of
it

It cost him something of an effort to take these repairs in hand but he
bowed his head and set to Merle poor girl needed a pair of shoes

At times too he would turn from the anvil and the darkness within and
come out into the doorway for a breath of air and here he would look
out upon the daythe great broad empty day

A man with a sledgehammer in his hands instinctively looks up at the
heavens He has inherited that instinct from his great ancestor who
brought down fire and thought to men and taught them to rebel against
God

Peer looked at the sky and at the clouds sweeping across it in a
meaningless turmoil Rebellion against someone up there But heaven is
empty There is no one to rebel against

But then all the injustice the manifold iniquity Who is to sit in
judgment on it at the great day

Who No one

What Think of the millions of all kinds of martyrs who died under the
bloodiest torments yet innocent as babes at the breastis there to be
no day of reparation for them

None

But there must be a whole worldfull of victims of injustice whose
souls flit restlessly around because they died under a weight of
undeserved shamebecause they lost a battle in which the right was
theirsbecause they suffered and strove for truth but went down
because falsehood was the stronger Truth Right Is there no one then
who will one day give peace to the dead in their graves and set things
in their right places Is there no one

No one

The world rolls on its way Fate is blind and God smiles while Satan
works his will upon Job

Hold your peace and grip your sledgehammer idiot If ever your
conscience should embrace the universe that day the horror of it would
strike you dead Remember that you are a vertebrate animal and it is by
mistake that you have developed a soul

Cling clang The red sparks fly from the anvil Live out your life as
it is

But there began to dawn in him a strange longing to be united to
all those unfortunates whom fate had blindly crushed to gather them
together not to a common lamentation but to a common victory Not for
vengeance but for a song of praise Behold Thou eternal Omnipotence
how we requite Thy crueltywe praise life see how much more godlike we
are than Thou

A temple a temple for the modern spirit of man hungry for
eternitynot for the babbling of prayers but for a hymn from mans
munificent heart sent pealing up to heaven Will it comewill it one
day be built


One evening Peer came home from the postoffice apparently in high
spirits Hi Merle Ive got a letter from the Bruseth lady

Merle glanced at Lorentz who had instinctively come close to her and
was looking at his father

From Bruseth How is Louise getting on she asked

You can see for yourself Heres the letter said he

Merle read it through hurriedly and glanced at Lorentz once more

That evening after the children had gone to bed the father and mother
sat up talking together in a low voice

And Merle had to admit that her husband was right It would be selfish
of them to keep the boy here when he might be heir to Bruseth some day
if they let him go

Suppose he stayed and worked here under his father and learned to be a
smith The blacksmiths day is overfactories do all the work now

And what schooling could he get away here in the country Aunt Marit
offered to send him to a good schoolAnd so the die was cast for him
too

But when they went with the boy to see him off at the station the
mothers handkerchief was at her eyes all the time do what she would

And when they came home she had to lie down in bed while Peer went
about the place humming to himself while he got ready a little supper
and brought it to her bedside

I cant understand how you can take it so easily she burst out

Nono he laughed a little oddly The less said about that the
better perhaps

But the next day it was Peer who said he felt lazy again and would lie
still a bit Merle looked at him and stroked his forehead

And the time went on They worked hard and constantly to make both ends
meet without help and they were content to take things as they came
When the big dairy was started close by he made a good deal of money
setting up the plant but he was not above sharpening a drill for the
roadgangs either He was often to be seen going down to the country
store in a sleeved waistcoat with a knapsack on his back He carried his
head high the closetrimmed beard was shading over into white his face
often had the strained look that comes from sleeplessness but his step
was light and he still had a joke for the girls whom he met

In summer the neighbours would often see them shutting up the house and
starting off up the hill with knapsack and coffeekettle and with little
Asta trotting between them They were gone it might be to try and
recapture some memory of old days with coffee in the open air by a
picnic fire

In the autumn when the great fields yellowed all the hillsides Peer
and Merle had a little plot of their own that showed golden too The
dimensions of things had shrunk not a little for these two A bushel
of corn was much to them now It hit them hard if their potatopatch
yielded a couple of measures less than they had reckoned on But the
housewives from the farms near by would often look in on Merle to see
how bright and clean she kept her little house and now that she had
no one to help her she found time herself to teach the peasant girls
something of cooking and sewing

But one habit had grown upon her She would stand long and long by the
window looking down the valley to where the hills closed it in It
was as if she were looking constantly for something to come in sight
something that should bring them better days It was a kind of Sunday
for her to stand there and look and wait

And the time went on



Chapter VII


DEAR KLAUS BROCK

I write to tell you of what has lately happened to us here chiefly in
the hope that it may be some comfort to yourself For I have discovered
dear friend that this worldsorrow of ours is something a man can get
over if only he will learn to see with his own eyes and not with those
of others

Most men would say things have steadily gone from bad to worse with
me and certainly I shall not pretend to feel any love for suffering
in itself On the contrary it hurts It does not ennoble It rather
brutalises unless it becomes so great that it embraces all things I
was once Engineer in charge at the First Cataractnow I am a blacksmith
in a country parish And that hurts I am cut off from reading because
of my eyes and from intercourse with people whose society would be a
pleasure because there are no such people here All this hurts even
when youve grown used to ita good thing in itself it is not Many
times I have thought that we must have reached the very bottom of the
inclined plane of adversity but always it proved to be only a break
The deepest deep was still to come You work on even when your head
feels like to split you save up every pin every match and yet the
bread you eat often tastes of charity That hurts You give up hoping
that things may be better some day you give up all hope all dreams
all faith all illusionssurely you have come to the end of all things
But no the very roots of ones being are still left the most precious
thing of all is still left What can that be you ask

That is what I was going to tell you

The thing that happened came just when things were beginning to look
a little brighter for us For some time past my head had been less
troublesome and I had got to work on a new harrowsteel again it
never lets one restand you know what endless possibilities a man sees
in a thing like that Merle was working with fresh courage What do you
think of a wife like that taking up the cross of her own free will to
go on sharing the life of a ruined man I hope you may meet a woman of
her sort one day True her hair is growing grey and her face lined
Her figure is not so straight as once it was her hands are red and
broken And yet all this has a soul of its own a beauty of its own
in my eyes because I know that each wrinkle is a mark left by the time
when some new trouble came upon us and found us together Then one day
she smiles and her smile has grown strained and full of sadness but
again it brings back to me times when both heaven and earth breathed
cold upon us and we drew closer to each other for warmth Our happiness
and our sufferings have moulded her into what she now is The world may
think perhaps that she is growing old to me she is only more beautiful
than before

And now I am coming to what I was going to tell you You will understand
that it was not easy to send away the two children and it doesnt make
things better to get letters from them constantly begging us to let them
come home again But we had still one little girl left little Asta who
was just five I wish you could have seen her If you were a father and
your tortured nerves had often made you harsh and unreasonable with
the two elder ones you would trywould you notto make it up in
lovingkindness to the one that was left Astaisnt it pretty Imagine
a sunburnt little being with black hair and her mothers beautiful
eyebrows always busy with her dolls or fetching in wood or baking
little cakes of her own for father when mothers baking bread for us
all chattering to the birds on the roof or singing now and then just
because some stray note of music has come into her head When mother is
busy scrubbing the floor little Asta must needs get hold of a wet rag
behind her back and slop away at a chair until she has got herself in a
terrible mess and then she gets smacked and screams for a moment but
soon runs out and sings herself happy again When youre at work in
the smithy there comes a sound of little feet and Father come to
dinner and a little hand takes hold of you and leads you to the door
Are you going to bath me tonight father Or Heres your napkin
father And though there might be only potatoes and milk for dinner
she would eat as if she were seated at the grandest banquet Arent
potatoes and milk your favourite dish father And she makes faces at
you in the eagerness of her questionings At night she slept in a box
at the foot of our bed and when I was lying sleepless it would often
happen that her light peaceful breathing filled me too with peace and
it was as if her little hand took mine and led me on to sleep itself to
beautiful divine sleep

And now as I come to the thing that happened I find it a little hard
to writemy hand begins to tremble But my hope is that there may be
some comfort in it for you too as there has proved to be for Merle and
me in the end

Our next neighbours here were a brazier and his wifepoor folks like
ourselves Soon after we first came I went over to have a talk with him
I found him a poor wizened little creature pottering about with his
acids and making a living as best as he could soldering and tinning
kettles and pans What do you want he asked looking askance at me
and as I went out I heard him bolt the door behind me Alas he was
afraidafraid that I was come to snatch his daily bread from him His
wife was a bigboned fleshy lump of a woman insolent enough in her
ways though she had just been in prison for criminal abetment in the
case of a girl that had got into trouble

One Sunday morning I was standing looking at some apple trees in bloom
in his garden One of them grew so close to the fence that the branches
hung over on my side and I bent one down to smell the blossom Then
suddenly I heard a cry Hi Tiger catch him and the braziers great
wolfdog came bounding down ready to fly at my throat I was lucky
enough to get hold of its collar before it could do me any harm and I
dragged it up to its owner and told him that if anything of the sort
happened again Id have the sheriffs officer after him Then the music
began He fairly let himself go and told me what he thought of me You
hold your jaw you cursed pauper coming here taking the bread out
of honest working peoples mouths and so on He hissed it out
flourishing his arms about and at last it seemed to me he was fumbling
about for a knife or something to throw at my head I couldnt help
laughing It was a scene in the grand style between two Great Powers in
the worldcompetition

A couple of days later I was standing at the forge when I heard a
shriek from my wife I rushed outwhat could be the matter Merle was
down by the fence already and all at once I saw what it wasthere was
Asta lying on the ground under the body of a great beast

And thenWell Merle tells me it was I that tore the thing away from
the little bundle of clothes beneath it and carried our little girl
home

A doctor is often a good refuge in trouble but though he may sew up a
ragged tear in a childs throat ever so neatly it doesnt necessarily
follow that it will help much

There was a mother though that would not let him gothat cried and
prayed and clung about him begging him to try once more if nothing
could be done And when at last he was gone she was always for going
after him again and grovelled on the floor and tore her haircould
not would not believe what she knew was true

And that night a father and mother sat up together staring strangely in
front of them The mother was quiet now The child was laid out decked
and ready The father sat by the window looking out It was in May and
the night was grey

Now it was that I began to realise how every great sorrow leads us
farther and farther out on the promontory of existence I had come to
the outermost point nowthere was no more

And I discovered too dear friend that these many years of adversity
had shaped me not in one but in various moulds for I had in me the
stuff for several quite distinct persons and now the work was done and
they could break free from my being and go their several ways

I saw a man rush out into the night shaking his fist at heaven and
earth a madman who refused to play his part in the farce any more and
so rushed down towards the river

But I myself sat there still

And I saw another a puny creature let loose a humble ashengrey
ascetic that bent his head and bowed under the lash and said Thy
will be done The Lord gave the Lord hath taken away A pitiful being
this that stole out into the night and disappeared

But I myself sat there still

I sat alone on the promontory of existence with the sun and the stars
gone out and icecold emptiness above me about me and in me on every
side

But then my friend by degrees it dawned on me that there was still
something left There was one little indomitable spark in me that began
to glow all by itselfit was as if I were lifted back to the first day
of existence and an eternal will rose up in me and said Let there be
light

This will it was that by and by grew and grew in me and made me strong

I began to feel an unspeakable compassion for all men upon earth and
yet in the last resort I was proud that I was one of them

I understood how blind fate can strip and plunder us of all and yet
something will remain in us at the last that nothing in heaven or
earth can vanquish Our bodies are doomed to die and our spirit to
be extinguished yet still we bear within us the spark the germ of an
eternity of harmony and light both for the world and for God

And I knew now that what I had hungered after in my best years was
neither knowledge nor honour nor riches nor to be a priest or a great
creator in steel no friend but to build temples not chapels for
prayers or churches for wailing penitent sinners but a temple for the
human spirit in its grandeur where we could lift up our souls in an
anthem as a gift to heaven

I could never do this now Perhaps there was nothing that I could do any
more And yet it seemed to me as I sat there that I had conquered

What happened then Well there had been a terrible drought all that
springit is often so in this valley The eternal north wind sent the
dry mould sweeping in clouds over the whole countryside and we were
threatened with one of our worst years of scarcity if the rain didnt
come

At last people ventured to sow their corn but then the frosts set in
and snow and sleet and the seed froze in the earth My neighbour the
brazier had his patch of ground sown with barleybut now he would have
to sow it again and where was he to get the seed He went from farm to
farm begging for some but people hated the sight of him after what had
happened about Astano one would lend him any and he had no money to
buy The boys on the roads hooted after him and some of the neighbours
talked of driving him out of the parish

I wasnt able to sleep much the next night either and when the clock
struck two I got up Where are you going asked Merle I want to see
if we havent a halfbushel of barley left I said Barleywhat do
you want with barley in the middle of the night I want to sow the
braziers plot with it I said and its best to do it now so that
nobody will know it was me

She sat up and stared at me What Histhethe braziers

Yes said I It wont do us any good you know to see his bit of
field lying bare all summer

Peerwhere are you going

Ive told you said I and went out But I knew that she was dressing
and meant to come too

It had rained during the night and as I came out the air was soft and
easy to breathe The morning still lay in a grey halflight with yellow
gleams from the windclouds to the north The scent of the budding
birches was in the air the magpies and starlings were up and about
but not a human soul was to be seen the farms were asleep the whole
countryside was asleep

I took the grain in a basket climbed over the neighbours fence and
began to sow No sign of life in the house the sheriffs officer had
come over and shot the dog the day before no doubt the brazier and his
wife were lying sleeping dreaming maybe of enemies all around trying
their best to do them harm

Dear friend is there any need to tell the rest Just think though how
one man may give away a kingdom and it costs him nothing and another
may give up a few handfuls of corn and it means to him not only all
that he has but a world of struggle and passion before he can bring his
soul to make that gift Do you think that is nothing As for meI did
not do this for Christs sake or because I loved my enemy but because
standing upon the ruins of my life I felt a vast responsibility
Mankind must arise and be better than the blind powers that order its
ways in the midst of its sorrows it must take heed that the godlike
does not die The spark of eternity was once more aglow in me and said
Let there be light

And more and more it came home to me that it is man himself that must
create the divine in heaven and on earththat that is his triumph over
the dead omnipotence of the universe Therefore I went out and sowed the
corn in my enemys field that God might exist

Ah if you had known that moment It was as if the air about me grew
alive with voices It was as though all the unfortunates I had seen and
known were bearing me company more and more they came the dead too
were joined to us an army from times past and long ago Sister Louise
was there she played her hymn and drew the voices all together into a
choir the choir of the living and the dead the choir of all mankind
See here are we all your sisters and brothers Your fate is ours We
are flung by the indifferent law of the universe into a life that we
cannot order as we would we are ravaged by injustice by sickness and
sorrow by fire and blood Even the happiest must die In his own home
he is but on a visit He never knows but that he may be gone tomorrow
And yet man smiles and laughs in the face of his tragic fate In the
midst of his thraldom he has created the beautiful on earth in the
midst of his torments he has had so much surplus energy of soul that he
has sent it radiating forth into the cold deeps of space and warmed them
with God

So marvellous art thou O spirit of man So godlike in thy very nature
Thou dost reap death and in return thou sowest the dream of everlasting
life In revenge for thine evil fate thou dost fill the universe with an
allloving God

We bore our part in his creation all we who now are dust we who sank
down into the dark like flames gone outwe wept we exulted we felt
the ecstasy and the agony but each of us brought our ray to the mighty
sea of light each of us from the negro setting up the first mark above
the grave of his dead to the genius raising the pillars of a temple
towards heaven We bore our part from the poor mother praying beside
a cradle to the hosts that lifted their songs of praise high up into
boundless space

Honour to thee O spirit of man Thou givest a soul to the world
thou settest it a goal thou art the hymn that lifts it into harmony
therefore turn back into thyself lift high thy head and meet proudly
the evil that comes to thee Adversity can crush thee death can blot
thee out yet art thou still unconquerable and eternal

Dear friend it was thus I felt And when the corn was sown and I went
back the sun was glancing over the shoulder of the hill There by the
fence stood Merle looking at me She had drawn a kerchief forward over
her brow after the fashion of the peasant women so that her face was
in shadow but she smiled to meas if she too the stricken mother
had risen up from the ocean of her suffering that here in the daybreak
she might take her share in the creating of God   



TRANSLATORS NOTE


PRONUNCIATION OF PROPER NAMES


For the convenience of readers a few points in which Norwegian
pronunciation differs from English are noted below

The vowels a e and i in the middle of words are pronounced much as in
Italian

aa  long o as in post or pole

e final is sounded as in German thus Louise Merle etc

d final is nearly always elided thus Raastad  Rosta

g before e or i is hard thus Ringeby not Rinjeby

j  the English y thus Bojer  Boyer Jens  Yens

l before another consonant is sounded thus Holm not Home


CURRENCY


The unit of currency in Norway is the crown krone which in normal
conditions is worth something over thirteen pence so that about
eighteen crowns go to the pound sterling Thus Peer Holms fortune in
the Savings Bank represented about L100 in English money and a million
crowns is equivalent to about 260000 in American money

To avoid encumbering the reader unnecessarily with the details of
Norwegian currency small amounts have been represented in this
translation by their equivalents in English money
