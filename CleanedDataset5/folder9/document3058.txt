A CHANGED MAN


CHAPTER I


The person who next to the actors themselves chanced to know most of
their story lived just below Top o Town as the spot was called in
an old substantiallybuilt house distinguished among its neighbours by
having an oriel window on the first floor whence could be obtained a
raking view of the High Street west and east the former including
Lauras dwelling the end of the Town Avenue hard by in which were
played the odd pranks hereafter to be mentioned the PortBredy road
rising westwards and the turning that led to the cavalry barracks where
the Captain was quartered Looking eastward down the town from the same
favoured gazebo the long perspective of houses declined and dwindled
till they merged in the highway across the moor The white riband of
road disappeared over Greys Bridge a quarter of a mile off to plunge
into innumerable rustic windings shy shades and solitary undulations up
hill and down dale for one hundred and twenty miles till it exhibited
itself at Hyde Park Corner as a smooth bland surface in touch with a busy
and fashionable world

To the barracks aforesaid had recently arrived the th Hussars a
regiment new to the locality Almost before any acquaintance with its
members had been made by the townspeople a report spread that they were
a crack body of men and had brought a splendid band For some reason
or other the town had not been used as the headquarters of cavalry for
many years the various troops stationed there having consisted of casual
detachments only so that it was with a sense of honour that
everybodyeven the small furniturebroker from whom the married troopers
hired tables and chairsreceived the news of their crack quality

In those days the Hussar regiments still wore over the left shoulder that
attractive attachment or frilled halfcoat hanging loosely behind like
the wounded wing of a bird which was called the pelisse though it was
known among the troopers themselves as a slingjacket It added
amazingly to their picturesqueness in womens eyes and indeed in the
eyes of men also

The burgher who lived in the house with the oriel window sat during a
great many hours of the day in that projection for he was an invalid
and time hung heavily on his hands unless he maintained a constant
interest in proceedings without Not more than a week after the arrival
of the Hussars his ears were assailed by the shout of one schoolboy to
another in the street below

Have ee heard this about the Hussars They are haunted Yesa ghost
troubles em he has followed em about the world for years

A haunted regiment that was a new idea for either invalid or stalwart
The listener in the oriel came to the conclusion that there were some
lively characters among the th Hussars

He made Captain Maumbrys acquaintance in an informal manner at an
afternoon tea to which he went in a wheeled chairone of the very rare
outings that the state of his health permitted Maumbry showed himself
to be a handsome man of twentyeight or thirty with an attractive hint
of wickedness in his manner that was sure to make him adorable with good
young women The large dark eyes that lit his pale face expressed this
wickedness strongly though such was the adaptability of their rays that
one could think they might have expressed sadness or seriousness just as
readily if he had had a mind for such

An old and deaf lady who was present asked Captain Maumbry bluntly
Whats this we hear about you They say your regiment is haunted

The Captains face assumed an aspect of grave even sad concern Yes
he replied it is too true

Some younger ladies smiled till they saw how serious he looked when they
looked serious likewise

Really said the old lady

Yes We naturally dont wish to say much about it

No no of course not Buthow haunted

Well thething as Ill call it follows us In country quarters or
town abroad or at home its just the same

How do you account for it

Hm Maumbry lowered his voice Some crime committed by certain of
our regiment in past years we suppose

Dear me    How very horrid and singular

But as I said we dont speak of it much

No    no

When the Hussar was gone a young lady disclosing a longsuppressed
interest asked if the ghost had been seen by any of the town

The lawyers son who always had the latest borough news said that
though it was seldom seen by any one but the Hussars themselves more
than one townsman and woman had already set eyes on it to his or her
terror The phantom mostly appeared very late at night under the dense
trees of the townavenue nearest the barracks It was about ten feet
high its teeth chattered with a dry naked sound as if they were those
of a skeleton and its hipbones could be heard grating in their sockets

During the darkest weeks of winter several timid persons were seriously
frightened by the object answering to this cheerful description and the
police began to look into the matter Whereupon the appearances grew
less frequent and some of the Boys of the regiment thankfully stated
that they had not been so free from ghostly visitation for years as they
had become since their arrival in Casterbridge

This playing at ghosts was the most innocent of the amusements indulged
in by the choice young spirits who inhabited the lichened redbrick
building at the top of the town bearing WD and a broad arrow on its
quoins Far more serious escapadeslevities relating to love wine
cards bettingwere talked of with no doubt more or less of
exaggeration That the Hussars Captain Maumbry included were the cause
of bitter tears to several young women of the town and country is
unquestionably true despite the fact that the gaieties of the young men
wore a more staring colour in this oldfashioned place than they would
have done in a large and modern city



CHAPTER II


Regularly once a week they rode out in marching order

Returning up the town on one of these occasions the romantic pelisse
flapping behind each horsemans shoulder in the soft southwest wind
Captain Maumbry glanced up at the oriel A mutual nod was exchanged
between him and the person who sat there reading The reader and a
friend in the room with him followed the troop with their eyes all the
way up the street till when the soldiers were opposite the house in
which Laura lived that young lady became discernible in the balcony

They are engaged to be married I hear said the friend

WhoMaumbry and Laura Neverso soon

Yes

Hell never marry Several girls have been mentioned in connection with
his name I am sorry for Laura

Oh but you neednt be They are excellently matched

Shes only one more

Shes one more and more still She has regularly caught him She is a
born player of the game of hearts and she knew how to beat him in his
own practices If there is one woman in the town who has any chance of
holding her own and marrying him she is that woman

This was true as it turned out By natural proclivity Laura had from
the first entered heart and soul into military romance as exhibited in
the plots and characters of those living exponents of it who came under
her notice From her earliest young womanhood civilians however
promising had no chance of winning her interest if the meanest warrior
were within the horizon It may be that the position of her uncles
house which was her home at the corner of West Street nearest the
barracks the daily passing of the troops the constant blowing of
trumpetcalls a furlong from her windows coupled with the fact that she
knew nothing of the inner realities of military life and hence idealized
it had also helped her minds original bias for thinking menatarms the
only ones worthy of a womans heart

Captain Maumbry was a typical prize one whom all surrounding maidens had
coveted ached for angled for wept for had by her judicious management
become subdued to her purpose and in addition to the pleasure of
marrying the man she loved Laura had the joy of feeling herself hated by
the mothers of all the marriageable girls of the neighbourhood

The man in the oriel went to the wedding not as a guest for at this
time he was but slightly acquainted with the parties but mainly because
the church was close to his house partly too for a reason which moved
many others to be spectators of the ceremony a subconsciousness that
though the couple might be happy in their experiences there was
sufficient possibility of their being otherwise to colour the musings of
an onlooker with a pleasing pathos of conjecture He could on occasion
do a pretty stroke of rhyming in those days and he beguiled the time of
waiting by pencilling on a blank page of his prayerbook a few lines
which though kept private then may be given here

 AT A HASTY WEDDING

 Triolet

 If hours be years the twain are blest
 For now they solace swift desire
 By lifelong ties that tether zest
 If hours be years The twain are blest
 Do eastern suns slope never west
 Nor pallid ashes follow fire
 If hours be years the twain are blest
 For now they solace swift desire

As if however to falsify all prophecies the couple seemed to find in
marriage the secret of perpetuating the intoxication of a courtship
which on Maumbrys side at least had opened without serious intent
During the winter following they were the most popular pair in and about
Casterbridgenay in South Wessex itself No smart dinner in the country
houses of the younger and gayer families within driving distance of the
borough was complete without their lively presence Mrs Maumbry was the
blithest of the whirling figures at the county ball and when followed
that inevitable incident of garrisontown life an amateur dramatic
entertainment it was just the same The acting was for the benefit of
such and such an excellent charitynobody cared what provided the play
were playedand both Captain Maumbry and his wife were in the piece
having been in fact by mutual consent the originators of the
performance And so with laughter and thoughtlessness and movement
all went merrily There was a little backwardness in the billpaying of
the couple but in justice to them it must be added that sooner or later
all owings were paid



CHAPTER III


At the chapelofease attended by the troops there arose above the edge
of the pulpit one Sunday an unknown face This was the face of a new
curate He placed upon the desk not the familiar sermon book but
merely a Bible The person who tells these things was not present at
that service but he soon learnt that the young curate was nothing less
than a great surprise to his congregation a mixed one always for though
the Hussars occupied the body of the building its nooks and corners were
crammed with civilians whom up to the present even the least
uncharitable would have described as being attracted thither less by the
services than by the soldiery

Now there arose a second reason for squeezing into an already overcrowded
church The persuasive and gentle eloquence of Mr Sainway operated like
a charm upon those accustomed only to the higher and dryer styles of
preaching and for a time the other churches of the town were thinned of
their sitters

At this point in the nineteenth century the sermon was the sole reason
for churchgoing amongst a vast body of religious people The liturgy was
a formal preliminary which like the Royal proclamation in a court of
assize had to be got through before the real interest began and on
reaching home the question was simply Who preached and how did he
handle his subject Even had an archbishop officiated in the service
proper nobody would have cared much about what was said or sung People
who had formerly attended in the morning only began to go in the evening
and even to the special addresses in the afternoon

One day when Captain Maumbry entered his wifes drawingroom filled with
hired furniture she thought he was somebody else for he had not come
upstairs humming the most catching air afloat in musical circles or in
his usual careless way

Whats the matter Jack she said without looking up from a note she
was writing

Wellnot much that I know

O but there is she murmured as she wrote

Whythis cursed new lath in a sheetI mean the new parson He wants
us to stop the bandplaying on Sunday afternoons

Laura looked up aghast

Why it is the one thing that enables the few rational beings hereabouts
to keep alive from Saturday to Monday

He says all the town flock to the music and dont come to the service
and that the pieces played are profane or mundane or inane or
somethingnot what ought to be played on Sunday Of course tis
Lautmann who settles those things

Lautmann was the bandmaster

The barrackgreen on Sunday afternoons had indeed become the promenade
of a great many townspeople cheerfully inclined many even of those who
attended in the morning at Mr Sainways service and little boys who
ought to have been listening to the curates afternoon lecture were too
often seen rolling upon the grass and making faces behind the more
dignified listeners

Laura heard no more about the matter however for two or three weeks
when suddenly remembering it she asked her husband if any further
objections had been raised

OMr Sainway I forgot to tell you Ive made his acquaintance He
is not a bad sort of man

Laura asked if either Maumbry or some others of the officers did not give
the presumptuous curate a good setting down for his interference

O wellweve forgotten that Hes a stunning preacher they tell me

The acquaintance developed apparently for the Captain said to her a
little later on Theres a good deal in Sainways argument about having
no band on Sunday afternoons After all it is close to his church But
he doesnt press his objections unduly

I am surprised to hear you defend him

It was only a passing thought of mine We naturally dont wish to
offend the inhabitants of the town if they dont like it

But they do

The invalid in the oriel never clearly gathered the details of progress
in this conflict of lay and clerical opinion but so it was that to the
disappointment of musicians the grief of outwalking lovers and the
regret of the junior population of the town and country round the band
playing on Sunday afternoons ceased in Casterbridge barracksquare

By this time the Maumbrys had frequently listened to the preaching of the
gentle if narrowminded curate for these lightnatured hitormiss
rackety people went to church like others for respectabilitys sake None
so orthodox as your unmitigated worldling A more remarkable event was
the sight to the man in the window of Captain Maumbry and Mr Sainway
walking down the High Street in earnest conversation On his mentioning
this fact to a caller he was assured that it was a matter of common talk
that they were always together

The observer would soon have learnt this with his own eyes if he had not
been told They began to pass together nearly every day Hitherto Mrs
Maumbry in fashionable walking clothes had usually been her husbands
companion but this was less frequent now The close and singular
friendship between the two men went on for nearly a year when Mr
Sainway was presented to a living in a denselypopulated town in the
midland counties He bade the parishioners of his old place a reluctant
farewell and departed the touching sermon he preached on the occasion
being published by the local printer Everybody was sorry to lose him
and it was with genuine grief that his Casterbridge congregation learnt
later on that soon after his induction to his benefice during some
bitter weather he had fallen seriously ill of inflammation of the lungs
of which he eventually died

We now get below the surface of things Of all who had known the dead
curate none grieved for him like the man who on his first arrival had
called him a lath in a sheet Mrs Maumbry had never greatly
sympathized with the impressive parson indeed she had been secretly
glad that he had gone away to better himself He had considerably
diminished the pleasures of a woman by whom the joys of earth and good
company had been appreciated to the full Sorry for her husband in his
loss of a friend who had been none of hers she was yet quite unprepared
for the sequel

There is something that I have wanted to tell you lately dear he said
one morning at breakfast with hesitation Have you guessed what it is

She had guessed nothing

That I think of retiring from the army

What

I have thought more and more of Sainway since his death and of what he
used to say to me so earnestly And I feel certain I shall be right in
obeying a call within me to give up this fighting trade and enter the
Church

Whatbe a parson

Yes

But what should I do

Be a parsons wife

Never she affirmed

But how can you help it

Ill run away rather she said vehemently

No you mustnt Maumbry replied in the tone he used when his mind was
made up Youll get accustomed to the idea for I am constrained to
carry it out though it is against my worldly interests I am forced on
by a Hand outside me to tread in the steps of Sainway

Jack she asked with calm pallor and round eyes do you mean to say
seriously that you are arranging to be a curate instead of a soldier

I might say a curate is a soldierof the church militant but I dont
want to offend you with doctrine I distinctly say yes

Late one evening a little time onward he caught her sitting by the dim
firelight in her room She did not know he had entered and he found her
weeping What are you crying about poor dearest he said

She started Because of what you have told me The Captain grew very
unhappy but he was undeterred

In due time the town learnt to its intense surprise that Captain
Maumbry had retired from the th Hussars and gone to Fountall
Theological College to prepare for the ministry



CHAPTER IV


O the pity of it Such a dashing soldierso popularsuch an
acquisition to the townthe soul of social life here And now   
One should not speak ill of the dead but that dreadful Mr Sainwayit
was too cruel of him

This is a summary of what was said when Captain now the Reverend John
Maumbry was enabled by circumstances to indulge his hearts desire of
returning to the scene of his former exploits in the capacity of a
minister of the Gospel A lowlying district of the town which at that
date was crowded with impoverished cottagers was crying for a curate
and Mr Maumbry generously offered himself as one willing to undertake
labours that were certain to produce little result and no thanks
credit or emolument

Let the truth be told about him as a clergyman he proved to be anything
but a brilliant success Painstaking singleminded deeply in earnest
as all could see his delivery was laboured his sermons were dull to
listen to and alas too too long Even the dispassionate judges who
sat by the hour in the barparlour of the White Hartan inn standing at
the dividing line between the poor quarter aforesaid and the fashionable
quarter of Maumbrys former triumphs and hence affording a position of
strict impartialityagreed in substance with the young ladies to the
westward though their views were somewhat more tersely expressed
Surely God Amighty spwiled a good sojer to make a bad pason when He
shifted Capn Mambry into a sarpless

The latter knew that such things were said but he pursued his daily
labours in and out of the hovels with serene unconcern

It was about this time that the invalid in the oriel became more than a
mere bowing acquaintance of Mrs Maumbrys She had returned to the town
with her husband and was living with him in a little house in the centre
of his circle of ministration when by some means she became one of the
invalids visitors After a general conversation while sitting in his
room with a friend of both an incident led up to the matter that still
rankled deeply in her soul Her face was now paler and thinner than it
had been even more attractive her disappointments having inscribed
themselves as meek thoughtfulness on a look that was once a little
frivolous The two ladies had called to be allowed to use the window for
observing the departure of the Hussars who were leaving for barracks
much nearer to London

The troopers turned the corner of Barrack Road into the top of High
Street headed by their band playing The girl I left behind me which
was formerly always the tune for such times though it is now nearly
disused They came and passed the oriel where an officer or two
looking up and discovering Mrs Maumbry saluted her whose eyes filled
with tears as the notes of the band waned away Before the little group
had recovered from that sense of the romantic which such spectacles
impart Mr Maumbry came along the pavement He probably had bidden his
former brethreninarms a farewell at the top of the street for he
walked from that direction in his rather shabby clerical clothes and
with a basket on his arm which seemed to hold some purchases he had been
making for his poorer parishioners Unlike the soldiers he went along
quite unconscious of his appearance or of the scene around

The contrast was too much for Laura With lips that now quivered she
asked the invalid what he thought of the change that had come to her

It was difficult to answer and with a wilfulness that was too strong in
her she repeated the question

Do you think she added that a womans husband has a right to do such
a thing even if he does feel a certain call to it

Her listener sympathized too largely with both of them to be anything but
unsatisfactory in his reply Laura gazed longingly out of the window
towards the thin dusty line of Hussars now smalling towards the
Mellstock Ridge I she said who should have been in their van on
the way to London am doomed to fester in a hole in Durnover Lane

Many events had passed and many rumours had been current concerning her
before the invalid saw her again after her leavetaking that day



CHAPTER V


Casterbridge had known many military and civil episodes many happy
times and times less happy and now came the time of her visitation The
scourge of cholera had been laid on the suffering country and the low
lying purlieus of this ancient borough had more than their share of the
infliction Mixen Lane in the Durnover quarter and in Maumbrys
parish was where the blow fell most heavily Yet there was a certain
mercy in its choice of a date for Maumbry was the man for such an hour

The spread of the epidemic was so rapid that many left the town and took
lodgings in the villages and farms Mr Maumbrys house was close to the
most infected street and he himself was occupied morn noon and night
in endeavours to stamp out the plague and in alleviating the sufferings
of the victims So as a matter of ordinary precaution he decided to
isolate his wife somewhere away from him for a while

She suggested a village by the sea near Budmouth Regis and lodgings
were obtained for her at Creston a spot divided from the Casterbridge
valley by a high ridge that gave it quite another atmosphere though it
lay no more than six miles off

Thither she went While she was rusticating in this place of safety and
her husband was slaving in the slums she struck up an acquaintance with
a lieutenant in the st Foot a Mr Vannicock who was stationed with
his regiment at the Budmouth infantry barracks As Laura frequently sat
on the shelving beach watching each thin wave slide up to her and
hearing without heeding its gnaw at the pebbles in its retreat he
often took a walk that way

The acquaintance grew and ripened Her situation her history her
beauty her agea year or two above his ownall tended to make an
impression on the young mans heart and a reckless flirtation was soon
in blithe progress upon that lonely shore

It was said by her detractors afterwards that she had chosen her lodging
to be near this gentleman but there is reason to believe that she had
never seen him till her arrival there Just now Casterbridge was so
deeply occupied with its own sad affairsa daily burying of the dead and
destruction of contaminated clothes and beddingthat it had little
inclination to promulgate such gossip as may have reached its ears on the
pair Nobody long considered Laura in the tragic cloud which overhung
all

Meanwhile on the Budmouth side of the hill the very mood of men was in
contrast The visitation there had been slight and much earlier and
normal occupations and pastimes had been resumed Mr Maumbry had
arranged to see Laura twice a week in the open air that she might run no
risk from him and having heard nothing of the faint rumour he met her
as usual one dry and windy afternoon on the summit of the dividing hill
near where the high road from town to town crosses the old Ridgeway at
right angles

He waved his hand and smiled as she approached shouting to her We
will keep this wall between us dear Walls formed the fieldfences
here You mustnt be endangered It wont be for long with Gods
help

I will do as you tell me Jack But you are running too much risk
yourself arent you I get little news of you but I fancy you are

Not more than others

Thus somewhat formally they talked an insulating wind beating the wall
between them like a millweir

But you wanted to ask me something he added

Yes You know we are trying in Budmouth to raise some money for your
sufferers and the way we have thought of is by a dramatic performance
They want me to take a part

His face saddened I have known so much of that sort of thing and all
that accompanies it I wish you had thought of some other way

She said lightly that she was afraid it was all settled You object to
my taking a part then Of course

He told her that he did not like to say he positively objected He
wished they had chosen an oratorio or lecture or anything more in
keeping with the necessity it was to relieve

But said she impatiently people wont come to oratorios or lectures
They will crowd to comedies and farces

Well I cannot dictate to Budmouth how it shall earn the money it is
going to give us Who is getting up this performance

The boys of the st

Ah yes our old game replied Mr Maumbry The grief of Casterbridge
is the excuse for their frivolity Candidly dear Laura I wish you
wouldnt play in it But I dont forbid you to I leave the whole to
your judgment

The interview ended and they went their ways northward and southward
Time disclosed to all concerned that Mrs Maumbry played in the comedy as
the heroine the lovers part being taken by Mr Vannicock



CHAPTER VI


Thus was helped on an event which the conduct of the mutuallyattracted
ones had been generating for some time

It is unnecessary to give details The st Foot left for Bristol and
this precipitated their action After a week of hesitation she agreed to
leave her home at Creston and meet Vannicock on the ridge hard by and to
accompany him to Bath where he had secured lodgings for her so that she
would be only about a dozen miles from his quarters

Accordingly on the evening chosen she laid on her dressingtable a note
for her husband running thus

 DEAR JACKI am unable to endure this life any longer and I have
 resolved to put an end to it I told you I should run away if you
 persisted in being a clergyman and now I am doing it One cannot
 help ones nature I have resolved to throw in my lot with Mr
 Vannicock and I hope rather than expect you will forgive meL

Then with hardly a scrap of luggage she went ascending to the ridge in
the dusk of early evening Almost on the very spot where her husband had
stood at their last tryst she beheld the outline of Vannicock who had
come all the way from Bristol to fetch her

I dont like meeting hereit is so unlucky she cried to him For
Gods sake let us have a place of our own Go back to the milestone and
Ill come on

He went back to the milestone that stands on the north slope of the
ridge where the old and new roads diverge and she joined him there

She was taciturn and sorrowful when he asked her why she would not meet
him on the top At last she inquired how they were going to travel

He explained that he proposed to walk to Mellstock Hill on the other
side of Casterbridge where a fly was waiting to take them by a crosscut
into the Ivell Road and onward to that town The Bristol railway was
open to Ivell

This plan they followed and walked briskly through the dull gloom till
they neared Casterbridge which place they avoided by turning to the
right at the Roman Amphitheatre and bearing round to Durnover Cross
Thence the way was solitary and open across the moor to the hill whereon
the Ivell fly awaited them

I have noticed for some time she said a lurid glare over the
Durnover end of the town It seems to come from somewhere about Mixen
Lane

The lamps he suggested

Theres not a lamp as big as a rushlight in the whole lane It is where
the cholera is worst

By Standfast Corner a little beyond the Cross they suddenly obtained an
end view of the lane Large bonfires were burning in the middle of the
way with a view to purifying the air and from the wretched tenements
with which the lane was lined in those days persons were bringing out
bedding and clothing Some was thrown into the fires the rest placed in
wheelbarrows and wheeled into the moor directly in the track of the
fugitives

They followed on and came up to where a vast copper was set in the open
air Here the linen was boiled and disinfected By the light of the
lanterns Laura discovered that her husband was standing by the copper
and that it was he who unloaded the barrow and immersed its contents The
night was so calm and muggy that the conversation by the copper reached
her ears

Are there many more loads tonight

Theres the clothes o they that died this afternoon sir But that
might bide till tomorrow for you must be tired out

Well do it at once for I cant ask anybody else to undertake it
Overturn that load on the grass and fetch the rest

The man did so and went off with the barrow Maumbry paused for a moment
to wipe his face and resumed his homely drudgery amid this squalid and
reeking scene pressing down and stirring the contents of the copper with
what looked like an old rollingpin The steam therefrom laden with
death travelled in a low trail across the meadow

Laura spoke suddenly I wont go tonight after all He is so tired
and I must help him I didnt know things were so bad as this

Vannicocks arm dropped from her waist where it had been resting as they
walked Will you leave she asked

I will if you say I must But Id rather help too There was no
expostulation in his tone

Laura had gone forward Jack she said I am come to help

The weary curate turned and held up the lantern Owhat is it you
Laura he asked in surprise Why did you come into this You had
better go backthe risk is great

But I want to help you Jack Please let me help I didnt come by
myselfMr Vannicock kept me company He will make himself useful too
if hes not gone on Mr Vannicock

The young lieutenant came forward reluctantly Mr Maumbry spoke
formally to him adding as he resumed his labour I thought the st
Foot had gone to Bristol

We have But I have run down again for a few things

The two newcomers began to assist Vannicock placing on the ground the
small bag containing Lauras toilet articles that he had been carrying
The barrowman soon returned with another load and all continued work for
nearly a halfhour when a coachman came out from the shadows to the
north

Beg pardon sir he whispered to Vannicock but Ive waited so long on
Mellstock hill that at last I drove down to the turnpike and seeing the
light here I ran on to find out what had happened

Lieutenant Vannicock told him to wait a few minutes and the last barrow
load was got through Mr Maumbry stretched himself and breathed
heavily saying There we can do no more

As if from the relaxation of effort he seemed to be seized with violent
pain He pressed his hands to his sides and bent forward

Ah I think it has got hold of me at last he said with difficulty I
must try to get home Let Mr Vannicock take you back Laura

He walked a few steps they helping him but was obliged to sink down on
the grass

I amafraidyoull have to send for a hurdle or shutter or
something he went on feebly or try to get me into the barrow

But Vannicock had called to the driver of the fly and they waited until
it was brought on from the turnpike hard by Mr Maumbry was placed
therein Laura entered with him and they drove to his humble residence
near the Cross where he was got upstairs

Vannicock stood outside by the empty fly awhile but Laura did not
reappear He thereupon entered the fly and told the driver to take him
back to Ivell



CHAPTER VII


Mr Maumbry had overexerted himself in the relief of the suffering poor
and fell a victimone of the lastto the pestilence which had carried
off so many Two days later he lay in his coffin

Laura was in the room below A servant brought in some letters and she
glanced them over One was the note from herself to Maumbry informing
him that she was unable to endure life with him any longer and was about
to elope with Vannicock Having read the letter she took it upstairs to
where the dead man was and slipped it into his coffin The next day she
buried him

She was now free

She shut up his house at Durnover Cross and returned to her lodgings at
Creston Soon she had a letter from Vannicock and six weeks after her
husbands death her lover came to see her

I forgot to give you back thisthat night he said presently handing
her the little bag she had taken as her whole luggage when leaving

Laura received it and absently shook it out There fell upon the carpet
her brush comb slippers nightdress and other simple necessaries for a
journey They had an intolerably ghastly look now and she tried to
cover them

I can now he said ask you to belong to me legallywhen a proper
interval has goneinstead of as we meant

There was languor in his utterance hinting at a possibility that it was
perfunctorily made Laura picked up her articles answering that he
certainly could so ask hershe was free Yet not her expression either
could be called an ardent response Then she blinked more and more
quickly and put her handkerchief to her face She was weeping violently

He did not move or try to comfort her in any way What had come between
them No living person They had been lovers There was now no
material obstacle whatever to their union But there was the insistent
shadow of that unconscious one the thin figure of him moving to and fro
in front of the ghastly furnace in the gloom of Durnover Moor

Yet Vannicock called upon Laura when he was in the neighbourhood which
was not often but in two years as if on purpose to further the marriage
which everybody was expecting the st Foot returned to Budmouth Regis

Thereupon the two could not help encountering each other at times But
whether because the obstacle had been the source of the love or from a
sense of error and because Mrs Maumbry bore a less attractive look as a
widow than before their feelings seemed to decline from their former
incandescence to a mere tepid civility What domestic issues supervened
in Vannicocks further story the man in the oriel never knew but Mrs
Maumbry lived and died a widow

THE WAITING SUPPER


CHAPTER I


Whoever had perceived the yeoman standing on Squire Everards lawn in the
dusk of that October evening fifty years ago might have said at first
sight that he was loitering there from idle curiosity For a large five
light window of the manorhouse in front of him was unshuttered and
uncurtained so that the illuminated room within could be scanned almost
to its four corners Obviously nobody was ever expected to be in this
part of the grounds after nightfall

The apartment thus swept by an eye from without was occupied by two
persons they were sitting over dessert the tablecloth having been
removed in the oldfashioned way The fruits were local consisting of
apples pears nuts and such other products of the summer as might be
presumed to grow on the estate There was strong ale and rum on the
table and but little wine Moreover the appointments of the dining
room were simple and homely even for the date betokening a countrified
household of the smaller gentry without much wealth or ambitionformerly
a numerous class but now in great part ousted by the territorial
landlords

One of the two sitters was a young lady in white muslin who listened
somewhat impatiently to the remarks of her companion an elderly
rubicund personage whom the merest stranger could have pronounced to be
her father The watcher evinced no signs of moving and it became
evident that affairs were not so simple as they first had seemed The
tall farmer was in fact no accidental spectator and he stood by
premeditation close to the trunk of a tree so that had any traveller
passed along the road without the park gate or even round the lawn to
the door that person would scarce have noticed the other
notwithstanding that the gate was quite near at hand and the park little
larger than a paddock There was still light enough in the western
heaven to brighten faintly one side of the mans face and to show
against the trunk of the tree behind the admirable cut of his profile
also to reveal that the front of the manorhouse small though it seemed
was solidly built of stone in that nevertobesurpassed style for the
English country residencethe mullioned and transomed Elizabethan

The lawn although neglected was still as level as a bowlinggreenwhich
indeed it might once have served for and the blades of grass before the
window were raked by the candleshine which stretched over them so far
as to touch the yeomans face in front

Within the diningroom there were also with one of the twain the same
signs of a hidden purpose that marked the farmer The young ladys mind
was straying as clearly into the shadows as that of the loiterer was
fixed upon the roomnay it could be said that she was quite conscious
of his presence outside Impatience caused her foot to beat silently on
the carpet and she more than once rose to leave the table This
proceeding was checked by her father who would put his hand upon her
shoulder and unceremoniously press her down into her chair till he
should have concluded his observations Her replies were brief enough
and there was factitiousness in her smiles of assent to his views A
small iron casement between two of the mullions was open and some
occasional words of the dialogue were audible without

As for drainshow can I put in drains The pipes dont cost much
thats true but the labour in sinking the trenches is ruination And
then the gatesthey should be hung to stone posts otherwise theres no
keeping them up through harvest The Squires voice was strongly toned
with the local accent so that he said drains and geats like the
rustics on his estate

The landscape without grew darker and the young mans figure seemed to
be absorbed into the trunk of the tree The small stars filled in
between the larger the nebulae between the small stars the trees quite
lost their voice and if there was still a sound it was from the cascade
of a stream which stretched along under the trees that bounded the lawn
on its northern side

At last the young girl did get to her feet and secure her retreat I
have something to do papa she said I shall not be in the drawing
room just yet

Very well replied he Then I wont hurry And closing the door
behind her he drew his decanters together and settled down in his chair

Three minutes after that a womans shape emerged from the drawingroom
window and passing through a walldoor to the entrance front came
across the grass She kept well clear of the diningroom window but
enough of its light fell on her to show escaping from the darkhooded
cloak that she wore stray verges of the same light dress which had
figured but recently at the dinnertable The hood was contracted tight
about her face with a drawingstring making her countenance small and
babylike and lovelier even than before

Without hesitation she brushed across the grass to the tree under which
the young man stood concealed The moment she had reached him he
enclosed her form with his arm The meeting and embrace though by no
means formal were yet not passionate the whole proceeding was that of
persons who had repeated the act so often as to be unconscious of its
performance She turned within his arm and faced in the same direction
with himself which was towards the window and thus they stood without
speaking the back of her head leaning against his shoulder For a while
each seemed to be thinking his and her diverse thoughts

You have kept me waiting a long time dear Christine he said at last
I wanted to speak to you particularly or I should not have stayed How
came you to be dining at this time o night

Father has been out all day and dinner was put back till six I know I
have kept you but Nicholas how can I help it sometimes if I am not to
run any risk My poor father insists upon my listening to all he has to
say since my brother left he has had nobody else to listen to him and
tonight he was particularly tedious on his usual topicsdraining and
tenantfarmers and the village people I must take daddy to London he
gets so narrow always staying here

And what did you say to it all

Well I took the part of the tenantfarmers of course as the beloved
of one should in duty do There followed a little break or gasp
implying a strangled sigh

You are sorry you have encouraged that beloving one

O no Nicholas    What is it you want to see me for particularly

I know you are sorry as time goes on and everything is at a deadlock
with no prospect of change and your rural swain loses his freshness
Only think this secret understanding between us has lasted near three
year ever since you was a little over sixteen

Yes it has been a long time

And I an untamed uncultivated man who has never seen London and knows
nothing about society at all

Not uncultivated dear Nicholas Untravelled socially unpractised if
you will she said smiling Well I did sigh but not because I
regret being your promised one What I do sometimes regret is that the
scheme which my meetings with you are but a part of has not been
carried out completely You said Nicholas that if I consented to swear
to keep faith with you you would go away and travel and see nations
and peoples and cities and take a professor with you and study books
and art simultaneously with your study of men and manners and then come
back at the end of two years when I should find that my father would by
no means be indisposed to accept you as a soninlaw You said your
reason for wishing to get my promise before starting was that your mind
would then be more at rest when you were far away and so could give
itself more completely to knowledge than if you went as my unaccepted
lover only fuming with anxiety as to how I should be when you came back
I saw how reasonable that was and solemnly swore myself to you in
consequence But instead of going to see the world you stay on and on
here to see me

And you dont want me to see you

Yesnoit is not that It is that I have latterly felt frightened at
what I am doing when not in your actual presence It seems so wicked not
to tell my father that I have a lover close at hand within touch and
view of both of us whereas if you were absent my conduct would not seem
quite so treacherous The realities would not stare at one so You
would be a pleasant dream to me which I should be free to indulge in
without reproach of my conscience I should live in hopeful expectation
of your returning fully qualified to boldly claim me of my father There
I have been terribly frank I know

He in his turn had lapsed into gloomy breathings now I did plan it as
you state he answered I did mean to go away the moment I had your
promise But dear Christine I did not foresee two or three things I
did not know what a lot of pain it would cost to tear myself from you
And I did not know that my stingy uncleheaven forgive me calling him
sowould so flatly refuse to advance me money for my purposethe
scheme of travelling with a firstrate tutor costing a formidable sum o
money You have no idea what it would cost

But I have said that Ill find the money

Ah there he returned you have hit a sore place To speak truly
dear I would rather stay unpolished a hundred years than take your
money

But why Men continually use the money of the women they marry

Yes but not till afterwards No man would like to touch your money at
present and I should feel very mean if I were to do so in present
circumstances That brings me to what I was going to propose But
noupon the whole I will not propose it now

Ah I would guarantee expenses and you wont let me The money is my
personal possession it comes to me from my late grandfather and not
from my father at all

He laughed forcedly and pressed her hand There are more reasons why I
cannot tear myself away he added What would become of my uncles
farming Six hundred acres in this parish and five hundred in the
nexta constant traipsing from one farm to the other he cant be in two
places at once Still that might be got over if it were not for the
other matters Besides dear I still should be a little uneasy even
though I have your promise lest somebody should snap you up away from
me

Ah you should have thought of that before Otherwise I have committed
myself for nothing

I should have thought of it he answered gravely But I did not
There lies my fault I admit it freely Ah if you would only commit
yourself a little more I might at least get over that difficulty But I
wont ask you You have no idea how much you are to me still you could
not argue so coolly if you had What property belongs to you I hate the
very sound of it is you I care for I wish you hadnt a farthing in the
world but what I could earn for you

I dont altogether wish that she murmured

I wish it because it would have made what I was going to propose much
easier to do than it is now Indeed I will not propose it although I
came on purpose after what you have said in your frankness

Nonsense Nic Come tell me How can you be so touchy

Look at this then Christine dear He drew from his breastpocket a
sheet of paper and unfolded it when it was observable that a seal
dangled from the bottom

What is it She held the paper sideways so that what there was of
windowlight fell on its surface I can only read the Old English
letterswhyour names Surely it is not a marriagelicence

It is

She trembled O Nic how could you do thisand without telling me

Why should I have thought I must tell you You had not spoken frankly
then as you have now We have been all to each other more than these two
years and I thought I would propose that we marry privately and that I
then leave you on the instant I would have taken my travellingbag to
church and you would have gone home alone I should not have started on
my adventures in the brilliant manner of our original plan but should
have roughed it a little at first my great gain would have been that the
absolute possession of you would have enabled me to work with spirit and
purpose such as nothing else could do But I dare not ask you nowso
frank as you have been

She did not answer The document he had produced gave such unexpected
substantiality to the venture with which she had so long toyed as a vague
dream merely that she was in truth frightened a little Idont
know about it she said

Perhaps not Ah my little lady you are wearying of me

No Nic responded she creeping closer I am not Upon my word and
truth and honour I am not Nic

A mere tiller of the soil as I should be called he continued without
heeding her And youwell a daughter of one of theI wont say
oldest families because thats absurd all families are the same ageone
of the longest chronicled families about here whose name is actually the
name of the place

Thats not much I am sorry to say My poor brotherbut I wont speak
of that    Well she murmured mischievously after a pause you
certainly would not need to be uneasy if I were to do this that you want
me to do You would have me safe enough in your trap then I couldnt
get away

Thats just it he said vehemently It is a trapyou feel it so and
that though you wouldnt be able to get away from me you might
particularly wish to Ah if I had asked you two years ago you would
have agreed instantly But I thought I was bound to wait for the
proposal to come from you as the superior

Now you are angry and take seriously what I meant purely in fun You
dont know me even yet To show you that you have not been mistaken in
me I do propose to carry out this licence Ill marry you dear
Nicholas tomorrow morning

Ah Christine I am afraid I have stung you on to this so that I
cannot

No no no she hastily rejoined and there was something in her tone
which suggested that she had been put upon her mettle and would not
flinch Take me whilst I am in the humour What church is the licence
for

That Ive not looked to seewhy our parish church here of course Ah
then we cannot use it We dare not be married here

We do dare said she And we will too if youll be there

If Ill be there

They speedily came to an agreement that he should be in the churchporch
at ten minutes to eight on the following morning awaiting her and that
immediately after the conclusion of the service which would make them
one Nicholas should set out on his longdeferred educational tour
towards the cost of which she was resolving to bring a substantial
subscription with her to church Then slipping from him she went
indoors by the way she had come and Nicholas bent his steps homewards



CHAPTER II


Instead of leaving the spot by the gate he flung himself over the fence
and pursued a direction towards the river under the trees And it was
now in his lonely progress that he showed for the first time outwardly
that he was not altogether unworthy of her He wore long waterboots
reaching above his knees and instead of making a circuit to find a
bridge by which he might cross the Froomthe river aforesaidhe made
straight for the point whence proceeded the low roar that was at this
hour the only evidence of the streams existence He speedily stood on
the verge of the waterfall which caused the noise and stepping into the
water at the top of the fall waded through with the sure tread of one
who knew every inch of his footing even though the canopy of trees
rendered the darkness almost absolute and a false step would have
precipitated him into the pool beneath Soon reaching the boundary of
the grounds he continued in the same direct line to traverse the
alluvial valley full of brooks and tributaries to the main streamin
former times quite impassable and impassable in winter now Sometimes
he would cross a deep gully on a plank not wider than the hand at
another time he ploughed his way through beds of speargrass where at a
few feet to the right or left he might have been sucked down into a
morass At last he reached firm land on the other side of this watery
tract and came to his house on the rise behindElsenfordan ordinary
farmstead from the back of which rose indistinct breathings belchings
and snortings the rattle of halters and other familiar features of an
agriculturists home

While Nicholas Long was packing his bag in an upper room of this
dwelling Miss Christine Everard sat at a desk in her own chamber at
FroomEverard manorhouse looking with pale fixed countenance at the
candles

I oughtI must now she whispered to herself I should not have
begun it if I had not meant to carry it through It runs in the blood of
us I suppose She alluded to a fact unknown to her lover the
clandestine marriage of an aunt under circumstances somewhat similar to
the present In a few minutes she had penned the following note

 October 13 183

 DEAR MR BEALANDCan you make it convenient to yourself to meet me at
 the Church tomorrow morning at eight I name the early hour because
 it would suit me better than later on in the day You will find me in
 the chancel if you can come An answer yes or no by the bearer of
 this will be sufficient

 CHRISTINE EVERARD

She sent the note to the rector immediately waiting at a small sidedoor
of the house till she heard the servants footsteps returning along the
lane when she went round and met him in the passage The rector had
taken the trouble to write a line and answered that he would meet her
with pleasure

A dripping fog which ushered in the next morning was highly favourable to
the scheme of the pair At that time of the century FroomEverard House
had not been altered and enlarged the public lane passed close under its
walls and there was a door opening directly from one of the old
parloursthe south parlour as it was calledinto the lane which led to
the village Christine came out this way and after following the lane
for a short distance entered upon a path within a belt of plantation by
which the church could be reached privately She even avoided the
churchyard gate walking along to a place where the turf without the low
wall rose into a mound enabling her to mount upon the coping and spring
down inside She crossed the wet graves and so glided round to the
door He was there with his bag in his hand He kissed her with a sort
of surprise as if he had expected that at the last moment her heart
would fail her

Though it had not failed her there was nevertheless no great ardour in
Christines bearingmerely the momentum of an antecedent impulse They
went up the aisle together the bottlegreen glass of the old lead
quarries admitting but little light at that hour and under such an
atmosphere They stood by the altarrail in silence Christines skirt
visibly quivering at each beat of her heart

Presently a quick step ground upon the gravel and Mr Bealand came round
by the front He was a quiet bachelor courteous towards Christine and
not at first recognizing in Nicholas a neighbouring yeoman for he lived
aloofly in the next parish advanced to her without revealing any
surprise at her unusual request But in truth he was surprised the
keen interest taken by many country young women at the present day in
church decoration and festivals being then unknown

Good morning he said and repeated the same words to Nicholas more
mechanically

Good morning she replied gravely Mr Bealand I have a serious
reason for asking you to meet meus I may say We wish you to marry
us

The rectors gaze hardened to fixity rather between than upon either of
them and he neither moved nor replied for some time

Ah he said at last

And we are quite ready

I had no idea

It has been kept rather private she said calmly

Where are your witnesses

They are outside in the meadow sir I can call them in a moment said
Nicholas

OhI see it isMr Nicholas Long said Mr Bealand and turning again
to Christine Does your father know of this

Is it necessary that I should answer that question Mr Bealand

I am afraid it ishighly necessary

Christine began to look concerned

Where is the licence the rector asked since there have been no
banns

Nicholas produced it Mr Bealand read it an operation which occupied
him several minutesor at least he made it appear so till Christine
said impatiently We are quite ready Mr Bealand Will you proceed
Mr Long has to take a journey of a great many miles today

And you

No I remain

Mr Bealand assumed firmness There is something wrong in this he
said I cannot marry you without your fathers presence

But have you a right to refuse us interposed Nicholas I believe we
are in a position to demand your fulfilment of our request

No you are not Is Miss Everard of age I think not I think she is
months from being so Eh Miss Everard

Am I bound to tell that

Certainly At any rate you are bound to write it Meanwhile I refuse
to solemnize the service And let me entreat you two young people to do
nothing so rash as this even if by going to some strange church you may
do so without discovery The tragedy of marriage

Tragedy

Certainly It is full of crises and catastrophes and ends with the
death of one of the actors The tragedy of marriage as I was saying is
one I shall not be a party to your beginning with such light hearts and
I shall feel bound to put your father on his guard Miss Everard Think
better of it I entreat you Remember the proverb Marry in haste and
repent at leisure

Christine spurred by opposition almost stormed at him Nicholas
implored but nothing would turn that obstinate rector She sat down and
reflected Byandby she confronted Mr Bealand

Our marriage is not to be this morning I see she said Now grant me
one favour and in return Ill promise you to do nothing rashly Do not
tell my father a word of what has happened here

I agreeif you undertake not to elope

She looked at Nicholas and he looked at her Do you wish me to elope
Nic she asked

No he said

So the compact was made and they left the church singly Nicholas
remaining till the last and closing the door On his way home carrying
the wellpacked bag which was just now to go no further the two men who
were mending watercarriers in the meadows approached the hedge as if
they had been on the alert all the time

You said you mid want us for zummat sir

All rightnever mind he answered through the hedge I did not
require you after all



CHAPTER III


At a manor not far away there lived a queer and primitive couple who had
lately been blessed with a son and heir The christening took place
during the week under notice and this had been followed by a feast to
the parishioners Christines father one of the same generation and
kind had been asked to drive over and assist in the entertainment and
Christine as a matter of course accompanied him

When they reached Athelhall as the house was called they found the
usually quiet nook a lively spectacle Tables had been spread in the
apartment which lent its name to the whole buildingthe hall
propercovered with a fine opentimbered roof whose braces purlins
and rafters made a brown thicket of oak overhead Here tenantry of all
ages sat with their wives and families and the servants were assisted in
their ministrations by the sons and daughters of the owners friends and
neighbours Christine lent a hand among the rest

She was holding a plate in each hand towards a huge brown platter of
baked ricepudding from which a footman was scooping a large spoonful
when a voice reached her ear over her shoulder Allow me to hold them
for you

Christine turned and recognized in the speaker the nephew of the
entertainer a young man from London whom she had already met on two or
three occasions

She accepted the proffered help and from that moment whenever he passed
her in their marchings to and fro during the remainder of the serving he
smiled acquaintance When their work was done he improved the few words
into a conversation He plainly had been attracted by her fairness

Bellston was a selfassured young man not particularly goodlooking
with more colour in his skin than even Nicholas had He had flushed a
little in attracting her notice though the flush had nothing of
nervousness in itthe air with which it was accompanied making it
curiously suggestive of a flush of anger and even when he laughed it was
difficult to banish that fancy

The late autumn sunlight streamed in through the window panes upon the
heads and shoulders of the venerable patriarchs of the hamlet and upon
the middleaged and upon the young upon men and women who had played
out or were to play tragedies or tragicomedies in that nook of
civilization not less great essentially than those which enacted on
more central arenas fix the attention of the world One of the party
was a cousin of Nicholas Longs who sat with her husband and children

To make himself as locally harmonious as possible Mr Bellston remarked
to his companion on the sceneIt does ones heart good he said to
see these simple peasants enjoying themselves

O Mr Bellston exclaimed Christine dont be too sure about that word
simple You little think what they see and meditate Their reasonings
and emotions are as complicated as ours

She spoke with a vehemence which would have been hardly present in her
words but for her own relation to Nicholas The sense of that produced
in her a nameless depression thenceforward The young man however
still followed her up

I am glad to hear you say it he returned warmly I was merely
attuning myself to your mood as I thought The real truth is that I
know more of the Parthians and Medes and dwellers in Mesopotamiaalmost
of any people indeedthan of the English rustics Travel and
exploration are my profession not the study of the British peasantry

Travel There was sufficient coincidence between his declaration and the
course she had urged upon her lover to lend Bellstons account of
himself a certain interest in Christines ears He might perhaps be able
to tell her something that would be useful to Nicholas if their dream
were carried out A door opened from the hall into the garden and she
somehow found herself outside chatting with Mr Bellston on this topic
till she thought that upon the whole she liked the young man The garden
being his uncles he took her round it with an air of proprietorship
and they went on amongst the Michaelmas daisies and chrysanthemums and
through a door to the fruitgarden A greenhouse was open and he went
in and cut her a bunch of grapes

How daring of you They are your uncles

O he dont mindI do anything here A rough old buffer isnt he

She was thinking of her Nic and felt that by comparison with her
present acquaintance the farmer more than held his own as a fine and
intelligent fellow but the harmony with her own existence in little
things which she found here imparted an alien tinge to Nicholas just
now The latter idealized by moonlight or a thousand miles of
distance was altogether a more romantic object for a womans dream than
this smart newlacquered man but in the sun of afternoon and amid a
surrounding company Mr Bellston was a very tolerable companion

When they reentered the hall Bellston entreated her to come with him up
a spiral stair in the thickness of the wall leading to a passage and
gallery whence they could look down upon the scene below The people had
finished their feast the newlychristened baby had been exhibited and a
few words having been spoken to them they began amid a racketing of
forms to make for the greensward without Nicholass cousin and cousins
wife and cousins children among the rest While they were filing out a
voice was heard callingHullohere Jim where are you said
Bellstons uncle The young man descended Christine following at
leisure

Now will ye be a good fellow the Squire continued and set them going
outside in some dance or other that they know Im dogtired and I want
to have a yew words with Mr Everard before we join emhey Everard
They are shy till somebody starts em afterwards theyll keep gwine
brisk enough

Ay that they wool said Squire Everard

They followed to the lawn and here it proved that James Bellston was as
shy or rather as averse as any of the tenantry themselves to acting
the part of fugleman Only the parish people had been at the feast but
outlying neighbours had now strolled in for a dance

They want Speed the Plough said Bellston coming up breathless It
must be a country dance I suppose Now Miss Everard do have pity upon
me I am supposed to lead off but really I know no more about speeding
the plough than a child just born Would you take one of the
villagersjust to start them my uncle says Suppose you take that
handsome young farmer over thereI dont know his name but I dare say
you doand Ill come on with one of the dairymans daughters as a second
couple

Christine turned in the direction signified and changed colourthough
in the shade nobody noticed it Oh yesI know him she said coolly
He is from near our own placeMr Nicholas Long

Thats capitalthen you can easily make him stand as first couple with
you Now I must pick up mine

II think Ill dance with you Mr Bellston she said with some
trepidation Because you see she explained eagerly I know the
figure and you dontso that I can help you while Nicholas Long I
know is familiar with the figure and that will make two couples who
know itwhich is necessary at least

Bellston showed his gratification by one of his angrypleasant flusheshe
had hardly dared to ask for what she proffered freely and having
requested Nicholas to take the dairymans daughter led Christine to her
place Long promptly stepping up second with his charge There were grim
silent depths in Nics character a small deedy spark in his eye as it
caught Christines was all that showed his consciousness of her Then
the fiddlers beganthe celebrated Mellstock fiddlers who given free
stripping could play from sunset to dawn without turning a hair The
couples wheeled and swung Nicholas taking Christines hand in the course
of business with the figure when she waited for him to give it a little
squeeze but he did not

Christine had the greatest difficulty in steering her partner through the
maze on account of his selfwill and when at last they reached the
bottom of the long line she was breathless with her hard labour
Resting here she watched Nic and his lady and though she had decidedly
cooled off in these later months began to admire him anew Nobody knew
these dances like him after all or could do anything of this sort so
well His performance with the dairymans daughter so won upon her that
when Speed the Plough was over she contrived to speak to him

Nic you are to dance with me next time

He said he would and presently asked her in a formal public manner
lifting his hat gallantly She showed a little backwardness which he
quite understood and allowed him to lead her to the top a row of
enormous length appearing below them as if by magic as soon as they had
taken their places Truly the Squire was right when he said that they
only wanted starting

What is it to be whispered Nicholas

She turned to the band The Honeymoon she said

And then they trod the delightful lastcentury measure of that name
which if it had been ever danced better was never danced with more zest
The perfect responsiveness which their tender acquaintance threw into the
motions of Nicholas and his partner lent to their gyrations the fine
adjustment of two interacting parts of a single machine The excitement
of the movement carried Christine back to the timethe unreflecting
passionate time about two years beforewhen she and Nic had been
incipient lovers only and it made her forget the carking anxieties the
vision of social breakers ahead that had begun to take the gilding off
her position now Nicholas on his part had never ceased to be a lover
no personal worries had as yet made him conscious of any staleness
flatness or unprofitableness in his admiration of Christine

Not quite so wildly Nic she whispered I dont object personally
but theyll notice us How came you here

I heard that you had driven over and I set outon purpose for this

Whatyou have walked

Yes If I had waited for one of uncles horses I should have been too
late

Five miles here and five backten miles on footmerely to dance

With you What made you think of this old Honeymoon thing

O it came into my head when I saw you as what would have been a
reality with us if you had not been stupid about that licence and had
got it for a distant church

Shall we try again

NoI dont know Ill think it over

The villagers admired their grace and skill as the dancers themselves
perceived but they did not know what accompanied that admiration in one
spot at least

People who wonder they can foot it so featly together should know what
some others think a waterman was saying to his neighbour Then their
wonder would be less

His comrade asked for information

Wellreally I hardly believe itbut tis said they be man and wife
Yes surewent to church and did the job amost afore twas light one
morning But mind not a word of this for twould be the loss of a
winters work to me if I had spread such a report and it were not true

When the dance had ended she rejoined her own section of the company Her
father and Mr Bellston the elder had now come out from the house and
were smoking in the background Presently she found that her father was
at her elbow

Christine dont dance too often with young Longas a mere matter of
prudence I mean as volk might think it odd he being one of our own
neighbouring farmers I should not mention this to ee if he were an
ordinary young fellow but being superior to the rest it behoves you to
be careful

Exactly papa said Christine

But the revived sense that she was deceiving him threw a damp over her
spirits But after all she said to herself he is a young man of
Elsenford handsome able and the soul of honour and I am a young woman
of the adjoining parish who have been constantly thrown into
communication with him Is it not by natures rule the most proper
thing in the world that I should marry him and is it not an absurd
conventional regulation which says that such a union would be wrong

It may be concluded that the strength of Christines largeminded
argument was rather an evidence of weakness than of strength in the
passion it concerned which had required neither argument nor reasoning
of any kind for its maintenance when full and flush in its early days

When driving home in the dark with her father she sank into pensive
silence She was thinking of Nicholas having to trudge on foot all those
miles back after his exertions on the sward Mr Everard arousing
himself from a nap said suddenly I have something to mention to ee
by Georgeso I have Chris You probably know what it is

She expressed ignorance wondering if her father had discovered anything
of her secret

Well according to him you know it But I will tell ee Perhaps you
noticed young Jim Bellston walking me off down the lawn with himwhether
or no we walked together a good while and he informed me that he wanted
to pay his addresses to ee I naturally said that it depended upon
yourself and he replied that you were willing enough you had given him
particular encouragementshowing your preference for him by specially
choosing him for your partnerhey In that case says I go on and
conquersettle it with herI have no objection The poor fellow was
very grateful and in short there we left the matter Hell propose to
morrow

She saw now to her dismay what James Bellston had read as encouragement
He has mistaken me altogether she said I had no idea of such a
thing

What you wont have him

Indeed I cannot

Chrissy said Mr Everard with emphasis theres noobody whom I should
so like you to marry as that young man Hes a thoroughly clever fellow
and fairly well provided for Hes travelled all over the temperate
zone but he says that directly he marries hes going to give up all
that and be a regular stayathome You would be nowhere safer than in
his hands

It is true she answered He is a highly desirable match and I
should be well provided for and probably very safe in his hands

Then dont be skittish and standto

She had spoken from her conscience and understanding and not to please
her father As a reflecting woman she believed that such a marriage
would be a wise one In great things Nicholas was closest to her nature
in little things Bellston seemed immeasurably nearer than Nic and life
was made up of little things

Altogether the firmament looked black for Nicholas Long notwithstanding
her halfhours ardour for him when she saw him dancing with the
dairymans daughter Most great passions movements and
beliefsindividual and nationalburst during their decline into a
temporary irradiation which rivals their original splendour and then
they speedily become extinct Perhaps the dance had given the last flare
up to Christines love It seemed to have improvidently consumed for its
immediate purpose all her ardour forwards so that for the future there
was nothing left but frigidity

Nicholas had certainly been very foolish about that licence



CHAPTER IV


This laxity of emotional tone was further increased by an incident when
two days later she kept an appointment with Nicholas in the Sallows The
Sallows was an extension of shrubberies and plantations along the banks
of the Froom accessible from the lawn of FroomEverard House only
except by wading through the river at the waterfall or elsewhere Near
the brink was a thicket of box in which a trunk lay prostrate this had
been once or twice their trystingplace though it was by no means a safe
one and it was here she sat awaiting him now

The noise of the stream muffled any sound of footsteps and it was before
she was aware of his approach that she looked up and saw him wading
across at the top of the waterfall

Noontide lights and dwarfed shadows always banished the romantic aspect
of her love for Nicholas Moreover something new had occurred to
disturb her and if ever she had regretted giving way to a tenderness for
himwhich perhaps she had not done with any distinctnessshe regretted
it now Yet in the bottom of their hearts those two were excellently
paired the very twin halves of a perfect whole and their love was pure
But at this hour surfaces showed garishly and obscured the depths
Probably her regret appeared in her face

He walked up to her without speaking the water running from his boots
and taking one of her hands in each of his own looked narrowly into her
eyes

Have you thought it over

What

Whether we shall try again you remember saying you would at the dance

Oh I had forgotten that

You are sorry we tried at all he said accusingly

I am not so sorry for the fact as for the rumours she said

Ah rumours

They say we are already married

Who

I cannot tell exactly I heard some whispering to that effect Somebody
in the village told one of the servants I believe This man said that
he was crossing the churchyard early on that unfortunate foggy morning
and heard voices in the chancel and peeped through the window as well as
the dim panes would let him and there he saw you and me and Mr Bealand
and so on but thinking his surmises would be dangerous knowledge he
hastened on And so the story got afloat Then your aunt too

Good Lordwhat has she done

The story was told her and she said proudly O yes it is true enough
I have seen the licence But it is not to be known yet

Seen the licence How the

Accidentally I believe when your coat was hanging somewhere

The information coupled with the infelicitous word proudly caused
Nicholas to flush with mortification He knew that it was in his aunts
nature to make a brag of that sort but worse than the brag was the fact
that this was the first occasion on which Christine had deigned to show
her consciousness that such a marriage would be a source of pride to his
relativesthe only two he had in the world

You are sorry then even to be thought my wife much less to be it He
dropped her hand which fell lifelessly

It is not sorry exactly dear Nic But I feel uncomfortable and vexed
that after screwing up my courage my fidelity to the point of going to
church you should have so muddledmanaged the matter that it has ended
in neither one thing nor the other How can I meet acquaintances when I
dont know what they are thinking of me

Then dear Christine let us mend the muddle Ill go away for a few
days and get another licence and you can come to me

She shrank from this perceptibly I cannot screw myself up to it a
second time she said I am sure I cannot Besides I promised Mr
Bealand And yet how can I continue to see you after such a rumour We
shall be watched now for certain

Then dont see me

I fear I must not for the present Altogether

What

I am very depressed

These views were not very inspiriting to Nicholas as he construed them
It may indeed have been possible that he construed them wrongly and
should have insisted upon her making the rumour true Unfortunately
too he had come to her in a hurry through brambles and briars water and
weed and the shaggy wildness which hung about his appearance at this
fine and correct time of day lent an impracticability to the look of him

You blame meyou repent your coursesyou repent that you ever ever
owned anything to me

No Nicholas I do not repent that she returned gently though with
firmness But I think that you ought not to have got that licence
without asking me first and I also think that you ought to have known
how it would be if you lived on here in your present position and made
no effort to better it I can bear whatever comes for social ruin is
not personal ruin or even personal disgrace But as a sensible
newrisen poet says whom I have been reading this morning

 The world and its ways have a certain worth
 And to press a point while these oppose
 Were simple policy Better wait

As soon as you had got my promise Nic you should have gone awayyesand
made a name and come back to claim me That was my silly girlish dream
about my hero

Perhaps I can do as much yet And would you have indeed liked better to
live away from me for family reasons than to run a risk in seeing me for
affections sake O what a cold heart it has grown If I had been a
prince and you a dairymaid Id have stood by you in the face of the
world

She shook her head Ahyou dont know what society isyou dont
know

Perhaps not Who was that strange gentleman of about sevenandtwenty I
saw at Mr Bellstons christening feast

Ohthat was his nephew James Now he is a man who has seen an unusual
extent of the world for his age He is a great traveller you know

Indeed

In fact an explorer He is very entertaining

No doubt

Nicholas received no shock of jealousy from her announcement He knew
her so well that he could see she was not in the least in love with
Bellston But he asked if Bellston were going to continue his
explorations

Not if he settles in life Otherwise he will I suppose

Perhaps I could be a great explorer too if I tried

You could I am sure

They sat apart and not together each looking afar off at vague objects
and not in each others eyes Thus the sad autumn afternoon waned while
the waterfall hissed sarcastically of the inevitableness of the
unpleasant Very different this from the time when they had first met
there

The nook was most picturesque but it looked horridly common and stupid
now Their sentiment had set a colour hardly less visible than a
material one on surrounding objects as sentiment must where life is but
thought Nicholas was as devoted as ever to the fair Christine but
unhappily he too had moods and humours and the division between them was
not closed

She had no sooner got indoors and sat down to her worktable than her
father entered the drawingroom

She handed him his newspaper he took it without a word went and stood
on the hearthrug and flung the paper on the floor

Christine whats the meaning of this terrible story I was just on my
way to look at the register

She looked at him without speech

You have marriedNicholas Long

No father

No Can you say no in the face of such facts as I have been put in
possession of

Yes

Butthe note you wrote to the rectorand the going to church

She briefly explained that their attempt had failed

Ah Then this is what that dancing meant was it By  it makes me
 How long has this been going on may I ask

This what

What indeed Why making him your beau Now listen to me Alls well
that ends well from this day madam this moment he is to be nothing
more to you You are not to see him Cut him adrift instantly I only
wish his volk were on my farmout they should go or I would know the
reason why However you are to write him a letter to this effect at
once

How can I cut him adrift

Why not You must my good maid

Well though I have not actually married him I have solemnly sworn to
be his wife when he comes home from abroad to claim me It would be
gross perjury not to fulfil my promise Besides no woman can go to
church with a man to deliberately solemnize matrimony and refuse him
afterwards if he does nothing wrong meanwhile

The uttered sound of her strong conviction seemed to kindle in Christine
a livelier perception of all its bearings than she had known while it had
lain unformulated in her mind For when she had done speaking she fell
down on her knees before her father covered her face and said Please
please forgive me papa How could I do it without letting you know I
dont know I dont know

When she looked up she found that in the turmoil of his mind her father
was moving about the room You are within an ace of ruining yourself
ruining me ruining us all he said You are nearly as bad as your
brother begad

Perhaps I amyesperhaps I am

That I should father such a harumscarum brood

It is very bad but Nicholas

Hes a scoundrel

He is not a scoundrel cried she turning quickly Hes as good and
worthy as you or I or anybody bearing our name or any nobleman in the
kingdom if you come to that Onlyonlyshe could not continue the
argument on those lines Now father listen she sobbed if you
taunt me Ill go off and join him at his farm this very day and marry
him tomorrow thats what Ill do

I dont taant ye

I wish to avoid unseemliness as much as you

She went away When she came back a quarter of an hour later thinking
to find the room empty he was standing there as before never having
apparently moved His manner had quite changed He seemed to take a
resigned and entirely different view of circumstances

Christine heres a paragraph in the paper hinting at a secret wedding
and Im blazed if it dont point to you Well since this was to happen
Ill bear it and not complain All volk have crosses and this is one
of mine Now this is what Ive got to sayI feel that you must carry
out this attempt at marrying Nicholas Long Faith you must The rumour
will become a scandal if you dontthats my view I have tried to look
at the brightest side of the case Nicholas Long is a young man superior
to most of his class and fairly presentable And hes not poorat
least his uncle is not I believe the old muddler could buy me up any
day However a farmers wife you must be as far as I can see As
youve made your bed so ye must lie Parents propose and ungrateful
children dispose You shall marry him and immediately

Christine hardly knew what to make of this He is quite willing to
wait and so am I We can wait for two or three years and then he will
be as worthy as

You must marry him And the sooner the better if tis to be done at
all    And yet I did wish you could have been Jim Bellstons wife I
did wish it But no

I too wished it and do still in one sense she returned gently His
moderation had won her out of her defiant mood and she was willing to
reason with him

You do he said surprised

I see that in a worldly sense my conduct with Mr Long may be considered
a mistake

HmI am glad to hear thatafter my death you may see it more clearly
still and you wont have long to wait to my reckoning

She fell into bitter repentance and kissed him in her anguish Dont
say that she cried Tell me what to do

If youll leave me for an hour or two Ill think Drive to the market
and backthe carriage is at the doorand Ill try to collect my senses
Dinner can be put back till you return

In a few minutes she was dressed and the carriage bore her up the hill
which divided the village and manor from the markettown



CHAPTER V


A quarter of an hour brought her into the High Street and for want of a
more important errand she called at the harnessmakers for a dogcollar
that she required

It happened to be marketday and Nicholas having postponed the
engagements which called him thither to keep the appointment with her in
the Sallows rushed off at the end of the afternoon to attend to them as
well as he could Arriving thus in a great hurry on account of the
lateness of the hour he still retained the wild amphibious appearance
which had marked him when he came up from the meadows to her sidean
exceptional condition of things which had scarcely ever before occurred
When she crossed the pavement from the shop door the shopman bowing and
escorting her to the carriage Nicholas chanced to be standing at the
roadwaggon office talking to the master of the waggons There were a
good many people about and those near paused and looked at her transit
in the full stroke of the level October sun which went under the brims
of their hats and pierced through their buttonholes From the group
she heard murmured the words Mrs Nicholas Long

The unexpected remark not without distinct satire in its tone took her
so greatly by surprise that she was confounded Nicholas was by this
time nearer though coming against the sun he had not yet perceived her
Influenced by her fathers lecture she felt angry with him for being
there and causing this awkwardness Her notice of him was therefore
slight supercilious perhaps slurred over and her vexation at his
presence showed distinctly in her face as she sat down in her seat
Instead of catching his waiting eye she positively turned her head away

A moment after she was sorry she had treated him so but he was gone

Reaching home she found on her dressingtable a note from her father The
statement was brief

 I have considered and am of the same opinion You must marry him He
 can leave home at once and travel as proposed I have written to him
 to this effect I dont want any victuals so dont wait dinner for
 me

Nicholas was the wrong kind of man to be blind to his Christines
mortification though he did not know its entire cause He had lately
foreseen something of this sort as possible

It serves me right he thought as he trotted homeward It was
absurdwicked of me to lead her on so The sacrifice would have been
too greattoo cruel And yet though he thus took her part he flushed
with indignation every time he said to himself She is ashamed of me

On the ridge which overlooked FroomEverard he met a neighbour of hisa
stockdealerin his gig and they drew rein and exchanged a few words A
part of the dealers conversation had much meaning for Nicholas

Ive had occasion to call on Squire Everard the former said but he
couldnt see me on account of being quite knocked up at some bad news he
has heard

Nicholas rode on past FroomEverard to Elsenford Farm pondering He had
new and startling matter for thought as soon as he got there The
Squires note had arrived At first he could not credit its import then
he saw further took in the tone of the letter saw the writers contempt
behind the words and understood that the letter was written as by a man
hemmed into a corner Christine was defiantlyinsultinglyhurled at
his head He was accepted because he was so despised

And yet with what respect he had treated her and hers Now he was
reminded of what an agricultural friend had said years ago seeing the
eyes of Nicholas fixed on Christine as on an angel when she passed
Better a little fire to warm ee than a great one to burn ee No good
can come of throwing your heart there He went into the mead sat down
and asked himself four questions

1 How could she live near her acquaintance as his wife even in his
absence without suffering martyrdom from the stings of their contempt

2 Would not this entail total estrangement between Christine and her
family also and her own consequent misery

3 Must not such isolation extinguish her affection for him

4 Supposing that her father rigged them out as colonists and sent them
off to America was not the effect of such exile upon one of her gentle
nurture likely to be as the last

In short whatever they should embark in together would be cruelty to
her and his death would be a relief It would indeed in one aspect be
a relief to her now if she were so ashamed of him as she had appeared to
be that day Were he dead this little episode with him would fade away
like a dream

Mr Everard was a goodhearted man at bottom but to take his enraged
offer seriously was impossible Obviously it was hotly made in his first
bitterness at what he had heard The least thing that he could do would
be to go away and never trouble her more To travel and learn and come
back in two years as mapped out in their first sanguine scheme required
a staunch heart on her side if the necessary expenditure of time and
money were to be afterwards justified and it were folly to calculate on
that when he had seen today that her heart was failing her already To
travel and disappear and not be heard of for many years would be a far
more independent stroke and it would leave her entirely unfettered
Perhaps he might rival in this kind the accomplished Mr Bellston of
whose journeyings he had heard so much

He sat and sat and the fog rose out of the river enveloping him like a
fleece first his feet and knees then his arms and body and finally
submerging his head When he had come to a decision he went up again
into the homestead He would be independent if he died for it and he
would free Christine Exile was the only course The first step was to
inform his uncle of his determination

Two days later Nicholas was on the same spot in the mead at almost the
same hour of eve But there was no fog now a blusterous autumn wind had
ousted the still golden days and misty nights and he was going full of
purpose in the opposite direction When he had last entered the mead he
was an inhabitant of the Froom valley in fortyeight hours he had
severed himself from that spot as completely as if he had never belonged
to it All that appertained to him in the Froom valley now was
circumscribed by the portmanteau in his hand

In making his preparations for departure he had unconsciously held a
faint foolish hope that she would communicate with him and make up their
estrangement in some soft womanly way But she had given no signal and
it was too evident to him that her latest mood had grown to be her fixed
one proving how well founded had been his impulse to set her free

He entered the Sallows found his way in the dark to the gardendoor of
the house slipped under it a note to tell her of his departure and
explaining its true reason to be a consciousness of her growing feeling
that he was an encumbrance and a humiliation Of the direction of his
journey and of the date of his return he said nothing

His course now took him into the high road which he pursued for some
miles in a northeasterly direction still spinning the thread of sad
inferences and asking himself why he should ever return At daybreak he
stood on the hill above ShottsfordForum and awaited a coach which
passed about this time along that highway towards Melchester and London



CHAPTER VI


Some fifteen years after the date of the foregoing incidents a man who
had dwelt in far countries and viewed many cities arrived at RoyTown
a roadside hamlet on the old western turnpike road not five miles from
FroomEverard and put up at the Bucks Head an isolated inn at that
spot He was still barely of middle age but it could be seen that a
haze of grey was settling upon the locks of his hair and that his face
had lost colour and curve as if by exposure to bleaching climates and
strange atmospheres or from ailments incidental thereto He seemed to
observe little around him by reason of the intrusion of his musings upon
the scene In truth Nicholas Long was just now the creature of old hopes
and fears consequent upon his arrivalthis man who once had not cared if
his name were blotted out from that district The evening light showed
wistful lines which he could not smooth away by the worldlings gloss of
nonchalance that he had learnt to fling over his face

The Bucks Head was a somewhat unusual place for a man of this sort to
choose as a house of sojourn in preference to some Casterbridge inn four
miles further on Before he left home it had been a lively old tavern at
which Highflyers and Heralds and Tallyhoes had changed horses on
their stages up and down the country but now the house was rather
cavernous and chilly the stableroofs were hollowbacked the landlord
was asthmatic and the traffic gone

He arrived in the afternoon and when he had sent back the fly and was
having a nondescript meal he put a question to the waitingmaid with a
mien of indifference

Squire Everard of FroomEverard Manor has been dead some years I
believe

She replied in the affirmative

And are any of the family left there still

O no bless you sir They sold the place years agoSquire Everards
son didand went away Ive never heard where they went to They came
quite to nothing

Never heard anything of the young ladythe Squires daughter

No You see twas before I came to these parts

When the waitress left the room Nicholas pushed aside his plate and
gazed out of the window He was not going over into the Froom Valley
altogether on Christines account but she had greatly animated his
motive in coming that way Anyhow he would push on there now that he was
so near and not ask questions here where he was liable to be wrongly
informed The fundamental inquiry he had not ventured to makewhether
Christine had married before the family went away He had abstained
because of an absurd dread of extinguishing hopeful surmise That the
Everards had left their old home was bad enough intelligence for one day

Rising from the table he put on his hat and went out ascending towards
the upland which divided this district from his native vale The first
familiar feature that met his eye was a little spot on the distant skya
clump of trees standing on a barrow which surmounted a yet more remote
uplanda point where in his childhood he had believed people could
stand and see America He reached the further verge of the plateau on
which he had entered Ah there was the valleya greenishgrey stretch
of colourstill looking placid and serene as though it had not much
missed him If Christine was no longer there why should he pause over
it this evening His uncle and aunt were dead and tomorrow would be
soon enough to inquire for remoter relatives Thus disinclined to go
further he turned to retrace his way to the inn

In the backward path he now perceived the figure of a woman who had been
walking at a distance behind him and as she drew nearer he began to be
startled Surely despite the variations introduced into that figure by
changing years its groundlines were those of Christine

Nicholas had been sentimental enough to write to Christine immediately on
landing at Southampton a day or two before this addressing his letter at
a venture to the old house and merely telling her that he planned to
reach the RoyTown inn on the present afternoon The news of the
scattering of the Everards had dissipated his hope of hearing of her but
here she was

So they metthere alone on the open down by a pond just as if the
meeting had been carefully arranged

She threw up her veil She was still beautiful though the years had
touched her a little more matronlymuch more homely Or was it only
that he was much less homely nowa man of the worldthe sense of
homeliness being relative Her face had grown to be preeminently of the
sort that would be called interesting Her habiliments were of a demure
and sober cast though she was one who had used to dress so airily and so
gaily Years had laid on a few shadows too in this

I received your letter she said when the momentary embarrassment of
their first approach had passed And I thought I would walk across the
hills today as it was fine I have just called at the inn and they
told me you were out I was now on my way homeward

He hardly listened to this though he intently gazed at her Christine
he said one word Are you free

II am in a certain sense she replied colouring

The announcement had a magical effect The intervening time between past
and present closed up for him and moved by an impulse which he had
combated for fifteen years he seized her two hands and drew her towards
him

She started back and became almost a mere acquaintance I have to tell
you she gasped that I havebeen married

Nicholass rosecoloured dream was immediately toned down to a greyish
tinge

I did not marry till many years after you had left she continued in
the humble tones of one confessing to a crime Oh Nic she cried
reproachfully how could you stay away so long

Whom did you marry

Mr Bellston

Iought to have expected it He was going to add And is he dead
but he checked himself Her dress unmistakably suggested widowhood and
she had said she was free

I must now hasten home said she I felt that considering my
shortcomings at our parting so many years ago I owed you the initiative
now

There is some of your old generosity in that Ill walk with you if I
may Where are you living Christine

In the same house but not on the old conditions I have part of it on
lease the farmer now tenanting the premises found the whole more than he
wanted and the owner allowed me to keep what rooms I chose I am poor
now you know Nicholas and almost friendless My brother sold the
FroomEverard estate when it came to him and the person who bought it
turned our home into a farmhouse Till my fathers death my husband and
I lived in the manorhouse with him so that I have never lived away from
the spot

She was poor That and the change of name sufficiently accounted for
the innservants ignorance of her continued existence within the walls
of her old home

It was growing dusk and he still walked with her A womans head arose
from the declivity before them and as she drew nearer Christine asked
him to go back

This is the wife of the farmer who shares the house she said She is
accustomed to come out and meet me whenever I walk far and am benighted
I am obliged to walk everywhere now

The farmers wife seeing that Christine was not alone paused in her
advance and Nicholas said Dear Christine if you are obliged to do
these things I am not and what wealth I can command you may command
likewise They say rolling stones gather no moss but they gather dross
sometimes I was one of the pioneers to the goldfields you know and
made a sufficient fortune there for my wants What is more I kept it
When I had done this I was coming home but hearing of my uncles death I
changed my plan travelled speculated and increased my fortune Now
before we part you remember you stood with me at the altar once and
therefore I speak with less preparation than I should otherwise use
Before we part then I ask shall another again intrude between us Or
shall we complete the union we began

She trembledjust as she had done at that very minute of standing with
him in the church to which he had recalled her mind I will not enter
into that now dear Nicholas she replied There will be more to talk
of and consider firstmore to explain which it would have spoiled this
meeting to have entered into now

Yes yes but

Further than the brief answer I first gave Nic dont press me
tonight I still have the old affection for you or I should not have
sought you Let that suffice for the moment

Very well dear one And when shall I call to see you

I will write and fix an hour I will tell you everything of my history
then

And thus they parted Nicholas feeling that he had not come here
fruitlessly When she and her companion were out of sight he retraced
his steps to RoyTown where he made himself as comfortable as he could
in the deserted old inn of his boyhoods days He missed her
companionship this evening more than he had done at any time during the
whole fifteen years and it was as though instead of separation there had
been constant communion with her throughout that period The tones of
her voice had stirred his heart in a nook which had lain stagnant ever
since he last heard them They recalled the woman to whom he had once
lifted his eyes as to a goddess Her announcement that she had been
anothers came as a little shock to him and he did not now lift his eyes
to her in precisely the same way as he had lifted them at first But he
forgave her for marrying Bellston what could he expect after fifteen
years

He slept at RoyTown that night and in the morning there was a short
note from her repeating more emphatically her statement of the previous
eveningthat she wished to inform him clearly of her circumstances and
to calmly consider with him the position in which she was placed Would
he call upon her on Sunday afternoon when she was sure to be alone

Nic she wrote on what a cosmopolite you are I expected to find my
old yeoman still but I was quite awed in the presence of such a citizen
of the world Did I seem rusty and unpractised Ahyou seemed so once
to me

Tender playful words the old Christine was in them She said Sunday
afternoon and it was now only Saturday morning He wished she had said
today that short revival of her image had vitalized to sudden heat
feelings that had almost been stilled Whatever she might have to
explain as to her positionand it was awkwardly narrowed no doubthe
could not give her up Miss Everard or Mrs Bellston what mattered
itshe was the same Christine

He did not go outside the inn all Saturday He had no wish to see or do
anything but to await the coming interview So he smoked and read the
local newspaper of the previous week and stowed himself in the chimney
corner In the evening he felt that he could remain indoors no longer
and the moon being near the full he started from the inn on foot in the
same direction as that of yesterday with the view of contemplating the
old village and its precincts and hovering round her house under the
cloak of night

With a stout stick in his hand he climbed over the five miles of upland
in a comparatively short space of time Nicholas had seen many strange
lands and trodden many strange ways since he last walked that path but
as he trudged he seemed wonderfully like his old self and had not the
slightest difficulty in finding the way In descending to the meads the
streams perplexed him a little some of the old footbridges having been
removed but he ultimately got across the larger watercourses and
pushed on to the village avoiding her residence for the moment lest she
should encounter him and think he had not respected the time of her
appointment

He found his way to the churchyard and first ascertained where lay the
two relations he had left alive at his departure then he observed the
gravestones of other inhabitants with whom he had been well acquainted
till by degrees he seemed to be in the society of all the elder Froom
Everard population as he had known the place Side by side as they had
lived in his day here were they now They had moved house in mass

But no tomb of Mr Bellston was visible though as he had lived at the
manorhouse it would have been natural to find it here In truth
Nicholas was more anxious to discover that than anything being curious
to know how long he had been dead Seeing from the glimmer of a light in
the church that somebody was there cleaning for Sunday he entered and
looked round upon the walls as well as he could But there was no
monument to her husband though one had been erected to the Squire

Nicholas addressed the young man who was sweeping I dont see any
monument or tomb to the late Mr Bellston

O no sir you wont see that said the young man drily

Why pray

Because hes not buried here Hes not Christianburied anywhere as
far as we know In short perhaps hes not buried at all and between
ourselves perhaps hes alive

Nicholas sank an inch shorter Ah he answered

Then you dont know the peculiar circumstances sir

I am a stranger hereas to late years

Mr Bellston was a travelleran explorerit was his calling you may
have heard his name as such

I remember Nicholas recalled the fact that this very bent of Mr
Bellstons was the incentive to his own roaming

Well when he married he came and lived here with his wife and his
wifes father and said he would travel no more But after a time he got
weary of biding quiet here and weary of herhe was not a good husband
to the young lady by any meansand he betook himself again to his old
trick of rovingwith her money Away he went quite out of the realm of
human foot into the bowels of Asia and never was heard of more He was
murdered it is said but nobody knows though as that was nine years ago
hes dead enough in principle if not in corporation His widow lives
quite humble for between her husband and her brother shes left in very
lean pasturage

Nicholas went back to the Bucks Head without hovering round her
dwelling This then was the explanation which she had wanted to make
Not dead but missing How could he have expected that the first fair
promise of happiness held out to him would remain untarnished She had
said that she was free and legally she was free no doubt Moreover
from her tone and manner he felt himself justified in concluding that she
would be willing to run the risk of a union with him in the
improbability of her husbands existence Even if that husband lived
his return was not a likely event to judge from his character A man
who could spend her money on his own personal adventures would not be
anxious to disturb her poverty after such a lapse of time

Well the prospect was not so unclouded as it had seemed But could he
even now give up Christine



CHAPTER VII


Two months more brought the year nearly to a close and found Nicholas
Long tenant of a spacious house in the markettown nearest to
FroomEverard A man of means genial character and a bachelor he was
an object of great interest to his neighbours and to his neighbours
wives and daughters But he took little note of this and had made it
his business to go twice a week no matter what the weather to the now
farmhouse at FroomEverard a wing of which had been retained as the
refuge of Christine He always walked to give no trouble in putting up
a horse to a housekeeper whose staff was limited

The two had put their heads together on the situation had gone to a
solicitor had balanced possibilities and had resolved to make the
plunge of matrimony Nothing venture nothing have Christine had
said with some of her old audacity

With almost gratuitous honesty they had let their intentions be widely
known Christine it is true had rather shrunk from publicity at first
but Nicholas argued that their boldness in this respect would have good
results With his friends he held that there was not the slightest
probability of her being other than a widow and a challenge to the
missing man now followed by no response would stultify any unpleasant
remarks which might be thrown at her after their union To this end a
paragraph was inserted in the Wessex papers announcing that their
marriage was proposed to be celebrated on such and such a day in
December

His periodic walks along the south side of the valley to visit her were
among the happiest experiences of his life The yellow leaves falling
around him in the foreground the wellwatered meads on the left hand
and the woman he loved awaiting him at the back of the scene promised a
future of much serenity as far as human judgment could foresee On
arriving he would sit with her in the parlour of the wing she
retained her general sittingroom where the only relics of her early
surroundings were an old clock from the other end of the house and her
own piano Before it was quite dark they would stand hand in hand
looking out of the window across the flat turf to the dark clump of trees
which hid further view from their eyes

Do you wish you were still mistress here dear he once said

Not at all said she cheerfully I have a good enough room and a
good enough fire and a good enough friend Besides my latter days as
mistress of the house were not happy ones and they spoilt the place for
me It was a punishment for my faithlessness Nic you do forgive me
Really you do

The twentythird of December the eve of the weddingday had arrived at
last in the train of such uneventful ones as these Nicholas had
arranged to visit her that day a little later than usual and see that
everything was ready with her for the morrows event and her removal to
his house for he had begun to look after her domestic affairs and to
lighten as much as possible the duties of her housekeeping

He was to come to an early supper which she had arranged to take the
place of a weddingbreakfast next daythe latter not being feasible in
her present situation An hour or so after dark the wife of the farmer
who lived in the other part of the house entered Christines parlour to
lay the cloth

What with getting the ham skinned and the blackpuddings hotted up
she said it will take me all my time before hes here if I begin this
minute

Ill lay the table myself said Christine jumping up Do you attend
to the cooking

Thank you maam And perhaps tis no matter seeing that it is the
last night youll have to do such work I knew this sort of life
wouldnt last long for ee being born to better things

It has lasted rather long Mrs Wake And if he had not found me out it
would have lasted all my days

But he did find you out

He did And Ill lay the cloth immediately

Mrs Wake went back to the kitchen and Christine began to bustle about
She greatly enjoyed preparing this table for Nicholas and herself with
her own hands She took artistic pleasure in adjusting each article to
its position as if half an inch error were a point of high importance
Finally she placed the two candles where they were to stand and sat down
by the fire

Mrs Wake reentered and regarded the effect Why not have another
candle or two maam she said Twould make it livelier Say four

Very well said Christine and four candles were lighted Really
she added surveying them I have been now so long accustomed to little
economies that they look quite extravagant

Ah youll soon think nothing of forty in his grand new house Shall I
bring in supper directly he comes maam

No not for half an hour and Mrs Wake you and Betsy are busy in the
kitchen I know so when he knocks dont disturb yourselves I can let
him in

She was again left alone and as it still wanted some time to Nicholass
appointment she stood by the fire looking at herself in the glass over
the mantel Reflectively raising a lock of her hair just above her
temple she uncovered a small scar That scar had a history The
terrible temper of her late husbandthose sudden moods of irascibility
which had made even his friendly excitements look like angerhad once
caused him to set that mark upon her with the bezel of a ring he wore He
declared that the whole thing was an accident She was a woman and kept
her own opinion

Christine then turned her back to the glass and scanned the table and the
candles shining one at each corner like types of the four Evangelists
and thought they looked too assumingtoo confident She glanced up at
the clock which stood also in this room there not being space enough
for it in the passage It was nearly seven and she expected Nicholas at
halfpast She liked the company of this venerable article in her lonely
life its tickings and whizzings were a sort of conversation It now
began to strike the hour At the end something grated slightly Then
without any warning the clock slowly inclined forward and fell at full
length upon the floor

The crash brought the farmers wife rushing into the room Christine had
wellnigh sprung out of her shoes Mrs Wakes enquiry what had happened
was answered by the evidence of her own eyes

How did it occur she said

I cannot say it was not firmly fixed I suppose Dear me how sorry I
am My dear fathers hallclock And now I suppose it is ruined

Assisted by Mrs Wake she lifted the clock Every inch of glass was of
course shattered but very little harm besides appeared to be done They
propped it up temporarily though it would not go again

Christine had soon recovered her composure but she saw that Mrs Wake
was gloomy What does it mean Mrs Wake she said Is it ominous

It is a sign of a violent death in the family

Dont talk of it I dont believe such things and dont mention it to
Mr Long when he comes Hes not in the family yet you know

O no it cannot refer to him said Mrs Wake musingly

Some remote cousin perhaps observed Christine no less willing to
humour her than to get rid of a shapeless dread which the incident had
caused in her own mind Andsupper is almost ready Mrs Wake

In threequarters of an hour

Mrs Wake left the room and Christine sat on Though it still wanted
fifteen minutes to the hour at which Nicholas had promised to be there
she began to grow impatient After the accustomed ticking the dead
silence was oppressive But she had not to wait so long as she had
expected steps were heard approaching the door and there was a knock

Christine was already there to open it The entrance had no lamp but it
was not particularly dark out of doors She could see the outline of a
man and cried cheerfully You are early it is very good of you

I beg pardon It is not Mr Bellston himselfonly a messenger with his
bag and greatcoat But he will be here soon

The voice was not the voice of Nicholas and the intelligence was
strange II dont understand Mr Bellston she faintly replied

Yes maam A gentlemana stranger to megave me these things at
Casterbridge station to bring on here and told me to say that Mr
Bellston had arrived there and is detained for halfanhour but will be
here in the course of the evening

She sank into a chair The porter put a small battered portmanteau on
the floor the coat on a chair and looking into the room at the spread
table said If you are disappointed maam that your husband as I
spose he is is not come I can assure you hell soon be here Hes
stopped to get a shave to my thinking seeing he wanted it What he
said was that I could tell you he had heard the news in Ireland and
would have come sooner his hand being forced but was hindered crossing
by the weather having took passage in a sailing vessel What news he
meant he didnt say

Ah yes she faltered It was plain that the man knew nothing of her
intended remarriage

Mechanically rising and giving him a shilling she answered to his good
night and he withdrew the beat of his footsteps lessening in the
distance She was alone but in what a solitude

Christine stood in the middle of the hall just as the man had left her
in the gloomy silence of the stopped clock within the adjoining room
till she aroused herself and turning to the portmanteau and greatcoat
brought them to the light of the candles and examined them The
portmanteau bore painted upon it the initials J B in white
lettersthe wellknown initials of her husband

She examined the greatcoat In the breastpocket was an empty spirit
flask which she firmly fancied she recognized as the one she had filled
many times for him when he was living at home with her

She turned desultorily hither and thither until she heard another tread
without and there came a second knocking at the door She did not
respond to it and Nicholasfor it was hethinking that he was not
heard by reason of a concentration on tomorrows proceedings opened the
door softly and came on to the door of her room which stood unclosed
just as it had been left by the Casterbridge porter

Nicholas uttered a blithe greeting cast his eye round the parlour which
with its tall candles blazing fire snowwhite cloth and
prettilyspread table formed a cheerful spectacle enough for a man who
had been walking in the dark for an hour

My bridealmost at last he cried encircling her with his arms

Instead of responding her figure became limp frigid heavy her head
fell back and he found that she had fainted

It was natural he thought She had had many little worrying matters to
attend to and but slight assistance He ought to have seen more
effectually to her affairs the closeness of the event had overexcited
her Nicholas kissed her unconscious facemore than once little
thinking what news it was that had changed its aspect Loth to call Mrs
Wake he carried Christine to a couch and laid her down This had the
effect of reviving her Nicholas bent and whispered in her ear Lie
quiet dearest no hurry and dream dream dream of happy days It is
only I You will soon be better He held her by the hand

No no no she said with a stare O how can this be

Nicholas was alarmed and perplexed but the disclosure was not long
delayed When she had sat up and by degrees made the stunning event
known to him he stood as if transfixed

Ahis it so said he Then becoming quite meek And why was he so
cruel as todelay his return till now

She dutifully recited the explanation her husband had given her through
the messenger but her mechanical manner of telling it showed how much
she doubted its truth It was too unlikely that his arrival at such a
dramatic moment should not be a contrived surprise quite of a piece with
his previous dealings towards her

But perhaps it may be trueand he may have become kind nownot as he
used to be she faltered Yes perhaps Nicholas he is an altered
manwell hope he is I suppose I ought not to have listened to my
legal advisers and assumed his death so surely Anyhow I am roughly
received back intothe right way

Nicholas burst out bitterly O what too too honest fools we wereto
so court daylight upon our intention by putting that announcement in the
papers Why could we not have married privately and gone away so that
he would never have known what had become of you even if he had
returned Christine he has done it to    But Ill say no more Of
course wemight fly now

No no we might not said she hastily

Very well But this is hard to bear When I looked for good then evil
came unto me and when I waited for light there came darkness So once
said a sorely tried man in the land of Uz and so say I now    I
wonder if he is almost here at this moment

She told him she supposed Bellston was approaching by the path across the
fields having sent on his greatcoat which he would not want walking

And is this meal laid for him or for me

It was laid for you

And it will be eaten by him

Yes

Christine are you sure that he is come or have you been sleeping over
the fire and dreaming it

She pointed anew to the portmanteau with the initials J B and to the
coat beside it

Well goodbyegoodbye Curse that parson for not marrying us fifteen
years ago

It is unnecessary to dwell further upon that parting There are scenes
wherein the words spoken do not even approximate to the level of the
mental communion between the actors Suffice it to say that part they
did and quickly and Nicholas more dead than alive went out of the
house homewards

Why had he ever come back During his absence he had not cared for
Christine as he cared now If he had been younger he might have felt
tempted to descend into the meads instead of keeping along their edge
The Froom was down there and he knew of quiet pools in that stream to
which death would come easily But he was too old to put an end to
himself for such a reason as love and another thought too kept him
from seriously contemplating any desperate act His affection for her
was strongly protective and in the event of her requiring a friends
support in future troubles there was none but himself left in the world
to afford it So he walked on

Meanwhile Christine had resigned herself to circumstances A resolve to
continue worthy of her history and of her family lent her heroism and
dignity She called Mrs Wake and explained to that worthy woman as
much of what had occurred as she deemed necessary Mrs Wake was too
amazed to reply she retreated slowly her lips parted till at the door
she said with a dry mouth And the beautiful supper maam

Serve it when he comes

When Mr Bellstonyes maam I will She still stood gazing as if
she could hardly take in the order

That will do Mrs Wake I am much obliged to you for all your
kindness And Christine was left alone again and then she wept

She sat down and waited That awful silence of the stopped clock began
anew but she did not mind it now She was listening for a footfall in a
state of mental tensity which almost took away from her the power of
motion It seemed to her that the natural interval for her husbands
journey thither must have expired but she was not sure and waited on

Mrs Wake again came in You have not rung for supper

He is not yet come Mrs Wake If you want to go to bed bring in the
supper and set it on the table It will be nearly as good cold Leave
the door unbarred

Mrs Wake did as was suggested made up the fire and went away Shortly
afterwards Christine heard her retire to her chamber But Christine
still sat on and still her husband postponed his entry

She aroused herself once or twice to freshen the fire but was ignorant
how the night was going Her watch was upstairs and she did not make the
effort to go up to consult it In her seat she continued and still the
supper waited and still he did not come

At length she was so nearly persuaded that the arrival of his things must
have been a dream after all that she again went over to them felt them
and examined them His they unquestionably were and their forwarding by
the porter had been quite natural She sighed and sat down again

Presently she fell into a doze and when she again became conscious she
found that the four candles had burnt into their sockets and gone out
The fire still emitted a feeble shine Christine did not take the
trouble to get more candles but stirred the fire and sat on

After a long period she heard a creaking of the chamber floor and stairs
at the other end of the house and knew that the farmers family were
getting up Byandby Mrs Wake entered the room candle in hand
bouncing open the door in her morning manner obviously without any
expectation of finding a person there

Lordamercy What sitting here again maam

Yes I am sitting here still

Youve been there ever since last night

Yes

Then

Hes not come

Well he wont come at this time o morning said the farmers wife
Do ee get on to bed maam You must be shrammed to death

It occurred to Christine now that possibly her husband had thought better
of obtruding himself upon her company within an hour of revealing his
existence to her and had decided to pay a more formal visit next day
She therefore adopted Mrs Wakes suggestion and retired



CHAPTER VIII


Nicholas had gone straight home neither speaking to nor seeing a soul
From that hour a change seemed to come over him He had ever possessed a
full share of selfconsciousness he had been readily piqued had shown
an unusual dread of being personally obtrusive But now his sense of
self as an individual provoking opinion appeared to leave him When
therefore after a day or two of seclusion he came forth again and the
few acquaintances he had formed in the town condoled with him on what had
happened and pitied his haggard looks he did not shrink from their
regard as he would have done formerly but took their sympathy as it
would have been accepted by a child

It reached his ears that Bellston had not appeared on the evening of his
arrival at any hotel in the town or neighbourhood or entered his wifes
house at all Thats a part of his cruelty thought Nicholas And
when two or three days had passed and still no account came to him of
Bellston having joined her he ventured to set out for FroomEverard

Christine was so shaken that she was obliged to receive him as she lay on
a sofa beside the square table which was to have borne their evening
feast She fixed her eyes wistfully upon him and smiled a sad smile

He has not come said Nicholas under his breath

He has not

Then Nicholas sat beside her and they talked on general topics merely
like saddened old friends But they could not keep away the subject of
Bellston their voices dropping as it forced its way in Christine no
less than Nicholas knowing her husbands character inferred that
having stopped her game as he would have phrased it he was taking
things leisurely and finding nothing very attractive in her limited
mode of living was meaning to return to her only when he had nothing
better to do

The bolt which laid low their hopes had struck so recently that they
could hardly look each other in the face when speaking that day But
when a week or two had passed and all the horizon still remained as
vacant of Bellston as before Nicholas and she could talk of the event
with calm wonderment Why had he come to go again like this

And then there set in a period of resigned surmise during which

 So like so very like was day to day

that to tell of one of them is to tell of all Nicholas would arrive
between three and four in the afternoon a faint trepidation influencing
his walk as he neared her door He would knock she would always reply
in person having watched for him from the window Then he would
whisperHe has not come

He has not she would say

Nicholas would enter then and she being ready bonneted they would walk
into the Sallows together as far as to the spot which they had frequently
made their place of appointment in their youthful days A plank bridge
which Bellston had caused to be thrown over the stream during his
residence with her in the manorhouse was now again removed and all was
just the same as in Nicholass time when he had been accustomed to wade
across on the edge of the cascade and come up to her like a merman from
the deep Here on the felled trunk which still lay rotting in its old
place they would now sit gazing at the descending sheet of water with
its neverending sarcastic hiss at their baffled attempts to make
themselves one flesh Returning to the house they would sit down
together to tea after which and the confidential chat that accompanied
it he walked home by the declining light This proceeding became as
periodic as an astronomical recurrence Twice a week he cameall
through that winter all through the spring following through the
summer through the autumn the next winter the next year and the next
till an appreciable span of human life had passed by Bellston still
tarried

Years and years Nic walked that way at this interval of three days from
his house in the neighbouring town and in every instance the aforesaid
order of things was customary and still on his arrival the form of words
went onHe has not come

He has not

So they grew older The dim shape of that third one stood continually
between them they could not displace it neither on the other hand
could it effectually part them They were in close communion yet not
indissolubly united lovers yet never growing cured of love By the
time that the fifth year of Nics visiting had arrived on about the five
hundredth occasion of his presence at her teatable he noticed that the
bleaching process which had begun upon his own locks was also spreading
to hers He told her so and they laughed Yet she was in good health
a condition of suspense which would have halfkilled a man had been
endured by her without complaint and even with composure

One day when these years of abeyance had numbered seven they had
strolled as usual as far as the waterfall whose faint roar formed a sort
of calling voice sufficient in the circumstances to direct their
listlessness Pausing there he looked up at her face and said Why
should we not try again Christine We are legally at liberty to do so
now Nothing venture nothing have

But she would not Perhaps a little primness of idea was by this time
ousting the native daring of Christine What he has done once he can do
twice she said He is not dead and if we were to marry he would say
we had forced his hand as he said before and duly reappear

Some years after when Christine was about fifty and Nicholas
fiftythree a new trouble of a minor kind arrived He found an
inconvenience in traversing the distance between their two houses
particularly in damp weather the years he had spent in trying climates
abroad having sown the seeds of rheumatism which made a journey
undesirable on inclement days even in a carriage He told her of this
new difficulty as he did of everything

If you could live nearer suggested she

Unluckily there was no house near But Nicholas though not a
millionaire was a man of means he obtained a small piece of ground on
lease at the nearest spot to her home that it could be so obtained which
was on the opposite brink of the Froom this river forming the boundary
of the FroomEverard manor and here he built a cottage large enough for
his wants This took time and when he got into it he found its
situation a great comfort to him He was not more than five hundred
yards from her now and gained a new pleasure in feeling that all sounds
which greeted his ears in the day or in the night also fell upon
hersthe caw of a particular rook the voice of a neighbouring
nightingale the whistle of a local breeze or the purl of the fall in
the meadows whose rush was a material rendering of Times ceaseless
scour over themselves wearing them away without uniting them

Christines missing husband was taking shape as a myth among the
surrounding residents but he was still believed in as corporeally
imminent by Christine herself and also in a milder degree by Nicholas
For a curious unconsciousness of the long lapse of time since his
revelation of himself seemed to affect the pair There had been no
passing events to serve as chronological milestones and the evening on
which she had kept supper waiting for him still loomed out with startling
nearness in their retrospects

In the seventeenth pensive year of this their parallel march towards the
common bourne a labourer came in a hurry one day to Nicholass house and
brought strange tidings The present owner of FroomEverarda
nonresidenthad been improving his property in sundry ways and one of
these was by dredging the stream which in the course of years had
become choked with mud and weeds in its passage through the Sallows The
process necessitated a reconstruction of the waterfall When the river
had been pumped dry for this purpose the skeleton of a man had been
found jammed among the piles supporting the edge of the fall Every
particle of his flesh and clothing had been eaten by fishes or abraded to
nothing by the water but the relics of a gold watch remained and on the
inside of the case was engraved the name of the maker of her husbands
watch which she well remembered

Nicholas deeply agitated hastened down to the place and examined the
remains attentively afterwards going across to Christine and breaking
the discovery to her She would not come to view the skeleton which lay
extended on the grass not a finger or toebone missing so neatly had
the aquatic operators done their work Conjecture was directed to the
question how Bellston had got there and conjecture alone could give an
explanation

It was supposed that on his way to call upon her he had taken a short
cut through the grounds with which he was naturally very familiar and
coming to the fall under the trees had expected to find there the plank
which during his occupancy of the premises with Christine and her
father he had placed there for crossing into the meads on the other side
instead of wading across as Nicholas had done Before discovering its
removal he had probably overbalanced himself and was thus precipitated
into the cascade the piles beneath the descending current wedging him
between them like the prongs of a pitchfork and effectually preventing
the rising of his body over which the weeds grew Such was the
reasonable supposition concerning the discovery but proof was never
forthcoming

To think said Nicholas when the remains had been decently interred
and he was again sitting with Christinethough not beside the
waterfallto think how we visited him How we sat over him hours and
hours gazing at him bewailing our fate when all the time he was
ironically hissing at us from the spot in an unknown tongue that we
could marry if we chose

She echoed the sentiment with a sigh

I have strange fancies she said I suppose it must have been my
husband who came back and not some other man

Nicholas felt that there was little doubt Besidesthe skeleton he
said

Yes    If it could not have been another personsbut no of course
it was he

You might have married me on the day we had fixed and there would have
been no impediment You would now have been seventeen years my wife and
we might have had tall sons and daughters

It might have been so she murmured

Wellis it still better late than never

The question was one which had become complicated by the increasing years
of each Their wills were somewhat enfeebled now their hearts sickened
of tender enterprise by hope too long deferred Having postponed the
consideration of their course till a year after the interment of
Bellston each seemed less disposed than formerly to take it up again

Is it worth while after so many years she said to him We are
fairly happy as we areperhaps happier than we should be in any other
relation seeing what old people we have grown The weight is gone from
our lives the shadow no longer divides us then let us be joyful
together as we are dearest Nic in the days of our vanity and

 With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come

He fell in with these views of hers to some extent But occasionally he
ventured to urge her to reconsider the case though he spoke not with the
fervour of his earlier years

Autumn 1887




ALICIAS DIARY


CHAPTER ISHE MISSES HER SISTER


July 7I wander about the house in a mood of unutterable sadness for
my dear sister Caroline has left home today with my mother and I shall
not see them again for several weeks They have accepted a longstanding
invitation to visit some old friends of ours the Marlets who live at
Versailles for cheapnessmy mother thinking that it will be for the good
of Caroline to see a little of France and Paris But I dont quite like
her going I fear she may lose some of that childlike simplicity and
gentleness which so characterize her and have been nourished by the
seclusion of our life here Her solicitude about her pony before
starting was quite touching and she made me promise to visit it daily
and see that it came to no harm

Caroline gone abroad and I left here It is the reverse of an ordinary
situation for good or illluck has mostly ordained that I should be the
absent one Mother will be quite tired out by the young enthusiasm of
Caroline She will demand to be taken everywhereto Paris continually
of course to all the stock shrines of historys devotees to palaces and
prisons to kings tombs and queens tombs to cemeteries and picture
galleries and royal hunting forests My poor mother having gone over
most of this ground many times before will perhaps not find the
perambulation so exhilarating as will Caroline herself I wish I could
have gone with them I would not have minded having my legs walked off
to please Caroline But this regret is absurd I could not of course
leave my father with not a soul in the house to attend to the calls of
the parishioners or to pour out his tea

July 15A letter from Caroline today It is very strange that she
tells me nothing which I expected her to tellonly trivial details She
seems dazzled by the brilliancy of Pariswhich no doubt appears still
more brilliant to her from the fact of her only being able to obtain
occasional glimpses of it She would see that Paris too has a seamy
side if you live there I was not aware that the Marlets knew so many
people If as mother has said they went to reside at Versailles for
reasons of economy they will not effect much in that direction while
they make a practice of entertaining all the acquaintances who happen to
be in their neighbourhood They do not confine their hospitalities to
English people either I wonder who this M de la Feste is in whom
Caroline says my mother is so much interested

July 18Another letter from Caroline I have learnt from this epistle
that M Charles de la Feste is only one of the many friends of the
Marlets that though a Frenchman by birth and now again temporarily at
Versailles he has lived in England many many years that he is a
talented landscape and marine painter and has exhibited at the Salon
and I think in London His style and subjects are considered somewhat
peculiar in Parisrather English than Continental I have not as yet
learnt his age or his condition married or single From the tone and
nature of her remarks about him he sometimes seems to be a middleaged
family man sometimes quite the reverse From his nomadic habits I
should say the latter is the most likely He has travelled and seen a
great deal she tells me and knows more about English literature than
she knows herself

July 21Letter from Caroline Query Is a friend of ours and the
Marlets of whom she now anonymously and mysteriously speaks the same
personage as the M de la Feste of her former letters He must be the
same I think from his pursuits If so whence this sudden change of
tone    I have been lost in thought for at least a quarter of an hour
since writing the preceding sentence Suppose my dear sister is falling
in love with this young manthere is no longer any doubt about his age
what a very awkward risky thing for her I do hope that my mother has
an eye on these proceedings But then poor mother never sees the drift
of anything she is in truth less of a mother to Caroline than I am If
I were there how jealously I would watch him and ascertain his designs

I am of a stronger nature than Caroline How I have supported her in the
past through her little troubles and great griefs Is she agitated at
the presence of this to her new and strange feeling But I am assuming
her to be desperately in love when I have no proof of anything of the
kind He may be merely a casual friend of whom I shall hear no more

July 24Then he is a bachelor as I suspected If M de la Feste ever
marries he will etc So she writes They are getting into close
quarters obviously Also Something to keep my hair smooth which M
de la Feste told me he had found useful for the tips of his moustache
Very naively related this and with how much unconsciousness of the
intimacy between them that the remark reveals But my motherwhat can
she be doing Does she know of this And if so why does she not allude
to it in her letters to my father    I have been to look at
Carolines pony in obedience to her reiterated request that I would not
miss a day in seeing that she was well cared for Anxious as Caroline
was about this pony of hers before starting she now never mentioned the
poor animal once in her letters The image of her pet suffers from
displacement

August 3Carolines forgetfulness of her pony has naturally enough
extended to me her sister It is ten days since she last wrote and but
for a note from my mother I should not know if she were dead or alive



CHAPTER IINEWS INTERESTING AND SERIOUS


August 5A cloud of letters A letter from Caroline another from
mother also one from each to my father

The probability to which all the intelligence from my sister has pointed
of late turns out to be a fact There is an engagement or almost an
engagement announced between my dear Caroline and M de la Festeto
Carolines sublime happiness and my mothers entire satisfaction as
well as to that of the Marlets They and my mother seem to know all
about the young manwhich is more than I do though a little extended
information about him considering that I am Carolines elder sister
would not have been amiss I half feel with my father who is much
surprised and I am sure not altogether satisfied that he should not
have been consulted at all before matters reached such a definite stage
though he is too amiable to say so openly I dont quite say that a good
thing should have been hindered for the sake of our opinion if it is a
good thing but the announcement comes very suddenly It must have been
foreseen by my mother for some time that this upshot was probable and
Caroline might have told me more distinctly that M de la Feste was her
lover instead of alluding so mysteriously to him as only a friend of the
Marlets and lately dropping his name altogether My father without
exactly objecting to him as a Frenchman wishes he were of English or
some other reasonable nationality for ones soninlaw but I tell him
that the demarcations of races kingdoms and creeds are wearing down
every day that patriotism is a sort of vice and that the character of
the individual is all we need think about in this case I wonder if in
the event of their marriage he will continue to live at Versailles or
if he will come to England

August 7A supplemental letter from Caroline answering by
anticipation some of the aforesaid queries She tells me that
Charles though he makes Versailles his present home is by no means
bound by his profession to continue there that he will live just where
she wishes provided it be not too far from some centre of thought art
and civilization My mother and herself both think that the marriage
should not take place till next year He exhibits landscapes and canal
scenery every year she says so I suppose he is popular and that his
income is sufficient to keep them in comfort If not I do not see why
my father could not settle something more on them than he had intended
and diminish by a little what he had proposed for me whilst it was
imagined that I should be the first to stand in need of such

Of engaging manner attractive appearance and virtuous character is
the reply I receive from her in answer to my request for a personal
description That is vague enough and I would rather have had one
definite fact of complexion voice deed or opinion But of course she
has no eye now for material qualities she cannot see him as he is She
sees him irradiated with glories such as never appertained and never will
appertain to any man foreign English or Colonial To think that
Caroline two years my junior and so childlike as to be five years my
junior in nature should be engaged to be married before me But that is
what happens in families more often than we are apt to remember

August 16Interesting news today Charles she says has pleaded that
their marriage may just as well be this year as next and he seems to
have nearly converted my mother to the same way of thinking I do not
myself see any reason for delay beyond the standing one of my father
having as yet had no opportunity of forming an opinion upon the man the
time or anything However he takes his lot very quietly and they are
coming home to talk the question over with us Caroline having decided
not to make any positive arrangements for this change of state till she
has seen me Subject to my own and my fathers approval she says they
are inclined to settle the date of the wedding for November three months
from the present time that it shall take place here in the village that
I of course shall be bridesmaid and many other particulars She draws
an artless picture of the probable effect upon the minds of the villagers
of this romantic performance in the chancel of our old church in which
she is to be chief actorthe foreign gentleman dropping down like a god
from the skies picking her up and triumphantly carrying her off Her
only grief will be separation from me but this is to be assuaged by my
going and staying with her for long months at a time This simple
prattle is very sweet to me my dear sister but I cannot help feeling
sad at the occasion of it In the nature of things it is obvious that I
shall never be to you again what I hitherto have been your guide
counsellor and most familiar friend

M de la Feste does certainly seem to be all that one could desire as
protector to a sensitive fragile child like Caroline and for that I am
thankful Still I must remember that I see him as yet only through her
eyes For her sake I am intensely anxious to meet him and scrutinise
him through and through and learn what the man is really made of who is
to have such a treasure in his keeping The engagement has certainly
been formed a little precipitately I quite agree with my father in that
still good and happy marriages have been made in a hurry before now and
mother seems well satisfied

August 20A terrible announcement came this morning and we are in deep
trouble I have been quite unable to steady my thoughts on anything to
day till nowhalfpast eleven at nightand I only attempt writing these
notes because I am too restless to remain idle and there is nothing but
waiting and waiting left for me to do Mother has been taken dangerously
ill at Versailles they were within a day or two of starting but all
thought of leaving must now be postponed for she cannot possibly be
moved in her present state I dont like the sound of haemorrhage at all
in a woman of her full habit and Caroline and the Marlets have not
exaggerated their accounts I am certain On the receipt of the letter my
father instantly decided to go to her and I have been occupied all day
in getting him off for as he calculates on being absent several days
there have been many matters for him to arrange before setting outthe
chief being to find some one who will do duty for him next Sundaya
quest of no small difficulty at such short notice but at last poor old
feeble Mr Dugdale has agreed to attempt it with Mr Highman the
Scripture reader to assist him in the lessons

I fain would have gone with my father to escape the irksome anxiety of
awaiting her but somebody had to stay and I could best be spared
George has driven him to the station to meet the last train by which he
will catch the midnight boat and reach Havre some time in the morning
He hates the sea and a night passage in particular I hope he will get
there without mishap of any kind but I feel anxious for him stayat
home as he is and unable to cope with any difficulty Such an errand
too the journey will be sad enough at best I almost think I ought to
have been the one to go to her

August 21I nearly fell asleep of heaviness of spirit last night over
my writing My father must have reached Paris by this time and now here
comes a letter   

LaterThe letter was to express an earnest hope that my father had set
out My poor mother is sinking they fear What will become of
Caroline O how I wish I could see mother why could not both have
gone

LaterI get up from my chair and walk from window to window and then
come and write a line I cannot even divine how poor Carolines marriage
is to be carried out if mother dies I pray that father may have got
there in time to talk to her and receive some directions from her about
Caroline and M de la Festea man whom neither my father nor I have
seen I who might be useful in this emergency am doomed to stay here
waiting in suspense

August 23A letter from my father containing the sad news that my
mothers spirit has flown Poor little Caroline is heartbrokenshe was
always more my mothers pet than I was It is some comfort to know that
my father arrived in time to hear from her own lips her strongly
expressed wish that Carolines marriage should be solemnized as soon as
possible M de la Feste seems to have been a great favourite of my dear
mothers and I suppose it now becomes almost a sacred duty of my father
to accept him as a soninlaw without criticism



CHAPTER IIIHER GLOOM LIGHTENS A LITTLE


September 10I have inserted nothing in my diary for more than a
fortnight Events have been altogether too sad for me to have the spirit
to put them on paper And yet there comes a time when the act of
recording ones trouble is recognized as a welcome method of dwelling
upon it   

My dear mother has been brought home and buried here in the parish It
was not so much her own wish that this should be done as my fathers who
particularly desired that she should lie in the family vault beside his
first wife I saw them side by side before the vault was closedtwo
women beloved by one man As I stood and Caroline by my side I fell
into a sort of dream and had an odd fancy that Caroline and I might be
also beloved of one and lie like these togetheran impossibility of
course being sisters When I awoke from my reverie Caroline took my
hand and said it was time to leave

September 14The wedding is indefinitely postponed Caroline is like a
girl awakening in the middle of a somnambulistic experience and does not
realize where she is or how she stands She walks about silently and I
cannot tell her thoughts as I used to do It was her own doing to write
to M de la Feste and tell him that the wedding could not possibly take
place this autumn as originally planned There is something depressing
in this long postponement if she is to marry him at all and yet I do not
see how it could be avoided

October 20I have had so much to occupy me in consoling Caroline that I
have been continually overlooking my diary Her life was much nearer to
my mothers than mine was She has never as I lived away from home
long enough to become selfdependent and hence in her first loss and
all that it involved she drooped like a rainbeaten lily But she is of
a nature whose wounds soon heal even though they may be deep and the
supreme poignancy of her sorrow has already passed

My father is of opinion that the wedding should not be delayed too long
While at Versailles he made the acquaintance of M de la Feste and
though they had but a short and hurried communion with each other he was
much impressed by M de la Festes disposition and conduct and is
strongly in favour of his suit It is odd that Carolines betrothed
should influence in his favour all who come near him His portrait
which dear Caroline has shown me exhibits him to be of a physique that
partly accounts for this but there must be something more than mere
appearance and it is probably some sort of glamour or fascinating
powerthe quality which prevented Caroline from describing him to me
with any accuracy of detail At the same time I see from the photograph
that his face and head are remarkably well formed and though the
contours of his mouth are hidden by his moustache his arched brows show
well the romantic disposition of a true lover and painter of Nature I
think that the owner of such a face as this must be tender and
sympathetic and true

October 30As my sisters grief for her mother becomes more and more
calmed her love for M de la Feste begins to reassume its former
absorbing command of her She thinks of him incessantly and writes
whole treatises to him by way of letters Her blank disappointment at
his announcement of his inability to pay us a visit quite so soon as he
had promised was quite tragic I too am disappointed for I wanted to
see and estimate him But having arranged to go to Holland to seize some
aerial effects for his pictures which are only to be obtained at this
time of the autumn he is obliged to postpone his journey this way which
is now to be made early in the new year I think myself that he ought to
have come at all sacrifices considering Carolines recent loss the sad
postponement of what she was looking forward to and her singleminded
affection for him Still who knows his professional success is
important Moreover she is cheerful and hopeful and the delay will
soon be overpast



CHAPTER IVSHE BEHOLDS THE ATTRACTIVE STRANGER


February 16We have had such a dull life here all the winter that I
have found nothing important enough to set down and broke off my journal
accordingly I resume it now to make an entry on the subject of dear
Carolines future It seems that she was too grieved immediately after
the loss of our mother to answer definitely the question of M de la
Feste how long the postponement was to be then afterwards it was
agreed that the matter should be discussed on his autumn visit but as he
did not come it has remained in abeyance till this week when Caroline
with the greatest simplicity and confidence has written to him without
any further pressure on his part and told him that she is quite ready to
fix the time and will do so as soon as he arrives to see her She is a
little frightened now lest it should seem forward in her to have revived
the subject of her own accord but she may assume that his question has
been waiting on for an answer ever since and that she has therefore
acted only within her promise In truth the secret at the bottom of it
all is that she is somewhat saddened because he has not latterly reminded
her of the pause in their affairsthat in short his original
impatience to possess her is not now found to animate him so obviously I
suppose that he loves her as much as ever indeed I am sure he must do
so seeing how lovable she is It is mostly thus with all men when women
are out of their sight they grow negligent Caroline must have
patience and remember that a man of his genius has many and important
calls upon his time In justice to her I must add that she does remember
it fairly well and has as much patience as any girl ever had in the
circumstances He hopes to come at the beginning of April at latest
Well when he comes we shall see him

April 5I think that what M de la Feste writes is reasonable enough
though Caroline looks heartsick about it It is hardly worth while for
him to cross all the way to England and back just now while the sea is
so turbulent seeing that he will be obliged in any event to come in
May when he has to be in London for professional purposes at which time
he can take us easily on his way both coming and going When Caroline
becomes his wife she will be more practical no doubt but she is such a
child as yet that there is no contenting her with reasons However the
time will pass quickly there being so much to do in preparing a
trousseau for her which must now be put in hand in order that we may
have plenty of leisure to get it ready On no account must Caroline be
married in halfmourning I am sure that mother could she know would
not wish it and it is odd that Caroline should be so intractably
persistent on this point when she is usually so yielding

April 30This month has flown on swallows wings We are in a great
state of excitementI as much as sheI cannot quite tell why He is
really coming in ten days he says

May 9 Four pmI am so agitated I can scarcely write and yet am
particularly impelled to do so before leaving my room It is the
unexpected shape of an expected event which has caused my absurd
excitement which proves me almost as much a schoolgirl as Caroline

M de la Feste was not as we understood to have come till tomorrow
but he is herejust arrived All household directions have devolved
upon me for my father not thinking M de la Feste would appear before
us for another fourandtwenty hours left home before post time to
attend a distant consecration and hence Caroline and I were in no small
excitement when Charless letter was opened and we read that he had been
unexpectedly favoured in the dispatch of his studio work and would
follow his letter in a few hours We sent the covered carriage to meet
the train indicated and waited like two newly strung harps for the first
sound of the returning wheels At last we heard them on the gravel and
the question arose who was to receive him It was strictly speaking my
duty but I felt timid I could not help shirking it and insisted that
Caroline should go down She did not however go near the door as she
usually does when anybody is expected but waited palpitating in the
drawingroom He little thought when he saw the silent hall and the
apparently deserted house how that house was at the very same moment
alive and throbbing with interest under the surface I stood at the back
of the upper landing where nobody could see me from downstairs and
heard him walk across the halla lighter step than my fathersand
heard him then go into the drawingroom and the servant shut the door
behind him and go away

What a pretty lovers meeting they must have had in there all to
themselves Carolines sweet face looking up from her black gownhow it
must have touched him I know she wept very much for I heard her and
her eyes will be red afterwards and no wonder poor dear though she is
no doubt happy I can imagine what she is telling him while I write
thisher fears lest anything should have happened to prevent his coming
after allgentle smiling reproaches for his long delay and things of
that sort His two portmanteaus are at this moment crossing the landing
on the way to his room I wonder if I ought to go down

A little laterI have seen him It was not at all in the way that I
intended to encounter him and I am vexed Just after his portmanteaus
were brought up I went out from my room to descend when at the moment
of stepping towards the first stair my eyes were caught by an object in
the hall below and I paused for an instant till I saw that it was a
bundle of canvas and sticks composing a sketching tent and easel At
the same nick of time the drawingroom door opened and the affianced pair
came out They were saying they would go into the garden and he waited
a moment while she put on her hat My idea was to let them pass on
without seeing me since they seemed not to want my company but I had
got too far on the landing to retreat he looked up and stood staring at
meengrossed to a dreamlike fixity Thereupon I too instead of
advancing as I ought to have done stood moonstruck and awkward and
before I could gather my weak senses sufficiently to descend she had
called him and they went out by the garden door together I then
thought of following them but have changed my mind and come here to jot
down these few lines It is all I am fit for   

He is even more handsome than I expected I was right in feeling he must
have an attraction beyond that of form it appeared even in that
momentary glance How happy Caroline ought to be But I must of
course go down to be ready with tea in the drawingroom by the time they
come indoors

11 pmI have made the acquaintance of M de la Feste and I seem to be
another woman from the effect of it I cannot describe why this should
be so but conversation with him seems to expand the view and open the
heart and raise one as upon stilts to wider prospects He has a good
intellectual forehead perfect eyebrows dark hair and eyes an animated
manner and a persuasive voice His voice is soft in qualitytoo soft
for a man perhaps and yet on second thoughts I would not have it less
so We have been talking of his art I had no notion that art demanded
such sacrifices or such tender devotion or that there were two roads for
choice within its precincts the road of vulgar moneymaking and the
road of high aims and consequent inappreciation for many long years by
the public That he has adopted the latter need not be said to those who
understand him It is a blessing for Caroline that she has been chosen
by such a man and she ought not to lament at postponements and delays
since they have arisen unavoidably Whether he finds hers a sufficiently
rich nature intellectually and emotionally for his own I know not but
he seems occasionally to be disappointed at her simple views of things
Does he really feel such love for her at this moment as he no doubt
believes himself to be feeling and as he no doubt hopes to feel for the
remainder of his life towards her

It was a curious thing he told me when we were left for a few minutes
alone that Caroline had alluded so slightly to me in her conversation
and letters that he had not realized my presence in the house here at
all But of course it was only natural that she should write and talk
most about herself I suppose it was on account of the fact of his being
taken in some measure unawares that I caught him on two or three
occasions regarding me fixedly in a way that disquieted me somewhat
having been lately in so little society till my glance aroused him from
his reverie and he looked elsewhere in some confusion It was fortunate
that he did so and thus failed to notice my own It shows that he too
is not particularly a society person

May 10Have had another interesting conversation with M de la Feste on
schools of landscape painting in the drawingroom after dinner this
eveningmy father having fallen asleep and left nobody but Caroline and
myself for Charles to talk to I did not mean to say so much to him and
had taken a volume of Modern Painters from the bookcase to occupy myself
with while leaving the two lovers to themselves but he would include me
in his audience and I was obliged to lay the book aside However I
insisted on keeping Caroline in the conversation though her views on
pictorial art were only too charmingly crude and primitive

Tomorrow if fine we are all three going to Wherryborne Wood where
Charles will give us practical illustrations of the principles of
coloring that he has enumerated tonight I am determined not to occupy
his attention to the exclusion of Caroline and my plan is that when we
are in the dense part of the wood I will lag behind and slip away and
leave them to return by themselves I suppose the reason of his
attentiveness to me lies in his simply wishing to win the good opinion of
one who is so closely united to Caroline and so likely to influence her
good opinion of him

May 11 LateI cannot sleep and in desperation have lit my candle and
taken up my pen My restlessness is occasioned by what has occurred to
day which at first I did not mean to write down or trust to any heart
but my own We went to Wherryborne WoodCaroline Charles and I as we
had intendedand walked all three along the green track through the
midst Charles in the middle between Caroline and myself Presently I
found that as usual he and I were the only talkers Caroline amusing
herself by observing birds and squirrels as she walked docilely alongside
her betrothed Having noticed this I dropped behind at the first
opportunity and slipped among the trees in a direction in which I knew I
should find another path that would take me home Upon this track I by
and by emerged and walked along it in silent thought till at a bend I
suddenly encountered M de la Feste standing stock still and smiling
thoughtfully at me

Where is Caroline said I

Only a little way off says he When we missed you from behind us we
thought you might have mistaken the direction we had followed so she has
gone one way to find you and I have come this way

We then went back to find Caroline but could not discover her anywhere
and the upshot was that he and I were wandering about the woods alone for
more than an hour On reaching home we found she had given us up after
searching a little while and arrived there some time before I should
not be so disturbed by the incident if I had not perceived that during
her absence from us he did not make any earnest effort to rediscover
her and in answer to my repeated expressions of wonder as to whither she
could have wandered he only said Oh shes quite safe she told me she
knew the way home from any part of this wood Let us go on with our
talk I assure you I value this privilege of being with one I so much
admire more than you imagine and other things of that kind I was so
foolish as to show a little perturbationI cannot tell why I did not
control myself and I think he noticed that I was not cool Caroline
has with her simple good faith thought nothing of the occurrence yet
altogether I am not satisfied



CHAPTER VHER SITUATION IS A TRYING ONE


May 15The more I think of it day after day the more convinced I am
that my suspicions are true He is too interested in mewell in plain
words loves me or not to degrade that phrase has a wild passion for
me and his affection for Caroline is that towards a sister only That
is the distressing truth how it has come about I cannot tell and it
wears upon me

A hundred little circumstances have revealed this to me and the longer I
dwell upon it the more agitating does the consideration become Heaven
only can help me out of the terrible difficulty in which this places me
I have done nothing to encourage him to be faithless to her I have
studiously kept out of his way have persistently refused to be a third
in their interviews Yet all to no purpose Some fatality has seemed to
rule ever since he came to the house that this disastrous inversion of
things should arise If I had only foreseen the possibility of it before
he arrived how gladly would I have departed on some visit or other to
the meanest friend to hinder such an apparent treachery But I blindly
welcomed himindeed made myself particularly agreeable to him for her
sake

There is no possibility of my suspicions being wrong not until they have
reached absolute certainty have I dared even to admit the truth to
myself His conduct today would have proved them true had I entertained
no previous apprehensions Some photographs of myself came for me by
post and they were handed round at the breakfast table and criticised I
put them temporarily on a side table and did not remember them until an
hour afterwards when I was in my own room On going to fetch them I
discovered him standing at the table with his back towards the door
bending over the photographs one of which he raised to his lips

The witnessing this act so frightened me that I crept away to escape
observation It was the climax to a series of slight and significant
actions all tending to the same conclusion The question for me now is
what am I to do To go away is what first occurs to me but what reason
can I give Caroline and my father for such a step besides it might
precipitate some sort of catastrophe by driving Charles to desperation
For the present therefore I have decided that I can only wait though
his contiguity is strangely disturbing to me now and I hardly retain
strength of mind to encounter him How will the distressing complication
end

May 19And so it has come My mere avoidance of him has precipitated
the worst issuea declaration I had occasion to go into the kitchen
garden to gather some of the double raggedrobins which grew in a corner
there Almost as soon as I had entered I heard footsteps without The
door opened and shut and I turned to behold him just inside it As the
garden is closed by four walls and the gardener was absent the spot
ensured absolute privacy He came along the path by the asparagusbed
and overtook me

You know why I come Alicia said he in a tremulous voice

I said nothing and hung my head for by his tone I did know

Yes he went on it is you I love my sentiment towards your sister is
one of affection too but protective tutelary affectionno more Say
what you will I cannot help it I mistook my feeling for her and I know
how much I am to blame for my want of selfknowledge I have fought
against this discovery night and day but it cannot be concealed Why
did I ever see you since I could not see you till I had committed
myself At the moment my eyes beheld you on that day of my arrival I
said This is the woman for whom my manhood has waited Ever since an
unaccountable fascination has riveted my heart to you Answer one word

O M de la Feste I burst out What I said more I cannot remember
but I suppose that the misery I was in showed pretty plainly for he
said Something must be done to let her know perhaps I have mistaken
her affection too but all depends upon what you feel

I cannot tell what I feel said I except that this seems terrible
treachery and every moment that I stay with you here makes it worse  
 Try to keep faith with herher young heart is tender believe me
there is no mistake in the quality of her love for you Would there
were This would kill her if she knew it

He sighed heavily She ought never to be my wife he said Leaving
my own happiness out of the question it would be a cruelty to her to
unite her to me

I said I could not hear such words from him and begged him in tears to
go away he obeyed and I heard the garden door shut behind him What is
to be the end of the announcement and the fate of Caroline

May 20I put a good deal on paper yesterday and yet not all I was
in truth hoping against hope against conviction against too conscious
selfjudgment I scarcely dare own the truth now yet it relieves my
aching heart to set it down Yes I love himthat is the dreadful fact
and I can no longer parry evade or deny it to myself though to the rest
of the world it can never be owned I love Carolines betrothed and he
loves me It is no yesterdays passion cultivated by our converse it
came at first sight independently of my will and my talk with him
yesterday made rather against it than for it but alas did not quench
it God forgive us both for this terrible treachery

May 25All is vague our courses shapeless He comes and goes being
occupied ostensibly at least with sketching in his tent in the wood
Whether he and she see each other privately I cannot tell but I rather
think they do not that she sadly awaits him and he does not appear Not
a sign from him that my repulse has done him any good or that he will
endeavour to keep faith with her O if I only had the compulsion of a
god and the selfsacrifice of a martyr

May 31It has all endedor rather this act of the sad drama has
endedin nothing He has left us No day for the fulfilment of the
engagement with Caroline is named my father not being the man to press
any one on such a matter or indeed to interfere in any way We two
girls are in fact quite defenceless in a case of this kind lovers may
come when they choose and desert when they choose poor father is too
urbane to utter a word of remonstrance or inquiry Moreover as the
approved of my dead mother M de la Feste has a sort of autocratic power
with my father who holds it unkind to her memory to have an opinion
about him I feeling it my duty asked M de la Feste at the last
moment about the engagement in a voice I could not keep firm

Since the death of your mother all has been indefiniteall he said
gloomily That was the whole Possibly Wherryborne Rectory may see him
no more

June 7 M de la Feste has writtenone letter to her one to me Hers
could not have been very warm for she did not brighten on reading it
Mine was an ordinary note of friendship filling an ordinary sheet of
paper which I handed over to Caroline when I had finished looking it
through But there was a scrap of paper in the bottom of the envelope
which I dared not show any one This scrap is his real letter I scanned
it alone in my room trembling hot and cold by turns He tells me he is
very wretched that he deplores what has happened but was helpless Why
did I let him see me if only to make him faithless Alas alas

June 21 My dear Caroline has lost appetite spirits health Hope
deferred maketh the heart sick His letters to her grow colderif
indeed he has written more than one He has refrained from writing again
to mehe knows it is no use Altogether the situation that he and she
and I are in is melancholy in the extreme Why are human hearts so
perverse



CHAPTER VIHER INGENUITY INSTIGATES HER


September 19Three months of anxious caretill at length I have taken
the extreme step of writing to him Our chief distress has been caused
by the state of poor Caroline who after sinking by degrees into such
extreme weakness as to make it doubtful if she can ever recover full
vigour has today been taken much worse Her position is very critical
The doctor says plainly that she is dying of a broken heartand that
even the removal of the cause may not now restore her Ought I to have
written to Charles sooner But how could I when she forbade me It was
her pride only which instigated her and I should not have obeyed

Sept 26Charles has arrived and has seen her He is shocked
consciencestricken remorseful I have told him that he can do no good
beyond cheering her by his presence I do not know what he thinks of
proposing to her if she gets better but he says little to her at
present indeed he dares not his words agitate her dangerously

Sept 28After a struggle between duty and selfishness such as I pray
to Heaven I may never have to undergo again I have asked him for pitys
sake to make her his wife here and now as she lies I said to him that
the poor child would not trouble him long and such a solemnization would
soothe her last hours as nothing else could do He said that he would
willingly do so and had thought of it himself but for one forbidding
reason in the event of her death as his wife he can never marry me her
sister according to our laws I started at his words He went on On
the other hand if I were sure that immediate marriage with me would save
her life I would not refuse for possibly I might after a while and out
of sight of you make myself fairly content with one of so sweet a
disposition as hers but if as is probable neither my marrying her nor
any other act can avail to save her life by so doing I lose both her and
you I could not answer him

Sept 29He continued firm in his reasons for refusal till this
morning and then I became possessed with an idea which I at once
propounded to him It was that he should at least consent to a form of
marriage with Caroline in consideration of her love a form which need
not be a legal union but one which would satisfy her sick and enfeebled
soul Such things have been done and the sentiment of feeling herself
his would inexpressibly comfort her mind I am sure Then if she is
taken from us I should not have lost the power of becoming his lawful
wife at some future day if it indeed should be deemed expedient if on
the other hand she lives he can on her recovery inform her of the
incompleteness of their marriage contract the ceremony can be repeated
and I can and I am sure willingly would avoid troubling them with my
presence till grey hairs and wrinkles make his unfortunate passion for me
a thing of the past I put all this before him but he demurred

Sept 30I have urged him again He says he will consider It is no
time to mince matters and as a further inducement I have offered to
enter into a solemn engagement to marry him myself a year after her
death

Sept 30 LaterAn agitating interview He says he will agree to
whatever I propose the three possibilities and our contingent acts being
recorded as follows First in the event of dear Caroline being taken
from us I marry him on the expiration of a year Second in the forlorn
chance of her recovery I take upon myself the responsibility of
explaining to Caroline the true nature of the ceremony he has gone
through with her that it was done at my suggestion to make her happy at
once before a special licence could be obtained and that a public
ceremony at church is awaiting her Third in the unlikely event of her
cooling and refusing to repeat the ceremony with him I leave England
join him abroad and there wed him agreeing not to live in England again
till Caroline has either married another or regards her attachment to
Charles as a bygone matter I have thought over these conditions and
have agreed to them all as they stand

11 pmI do not much like this scheme after all For one thing I
have just sounded my father on it before parting with him for the night
my impression having been that he would see no objection But he says he
could on no account countenance any such unreal proceeding however good
our intentions and even though the poor girl were dying it would not be
right So I sadly seek my pillow

October 1I am sure my father is wrong in his view Why is it not
right if it would be balm to Carolines wounded soul and if a real
ceremony is absolutely refused by Charlesmoreover is hardly practicable
in the difficulty of getting a special licence if he were agreed My
father does not know or will not believe that Carolines attachment has
been the cause of her hopeless condition But that it is so and that
the form of words would give her inexpressible happiness I know well
for I whispered tentatively in her ear on such marriages and the effect
was great Henceforth my father cannot be taken into confidence on the
subject of Caroline He does not understand her

12 oclock noonI have taken advantage of my fathers absence today to
confide my secret notion to a thoughtful young man who called here this
morning to speak to my father He is the Mr Theophilus Higham of whom
I have already had occasion to speaka Scripture reader in the next
town and is soon going to be ordained I told him the pitiable case
and my remedy He says ardently that he will assist mewould do
anything for me he is in truth an admirer of mine he sees no wrong
in such an act of charity He is coming again to the house this
afternoon before my father returns to carry out the idea I have spoken
to Charles who promises to be ready I must now break the news to
Caroline

11 oclock pmI have been in too much excitement till now to set down
the result We have accomplished our plan and though I feel like a
guilty sinner I am glad My father of course is not to be informed as
yet Caroline has had a seraphic expression upon her wasted transparent
face ever since I should hardly be surprised if it really saved her
life even now and rendered a legitimate union necessary between them In
that case my father can be informed of the whole proceeding and in the
face of such wonderful success cannot disapprove Meanwhile poor Charles
has not lost the possibility of taking unworthy me to fill her place
should she But I cannot contemplate that alternative unmoved and
will not write it Charles left for the South of Europe immediately
after the ceremony He was in a highstrung throbbing almost wild
state of mind at first but grew calmer under my exhortations I had to
pay the penalty of receiving a farewell kiss from him which I much
regret considering its meaning but he took me so unexpectedly and in a
moment was gone

Oct 6She certainly is better and even when she found that Charles
had been suddenly obliged to leave she received the news quite
cheerfully The doctor says that her apparent improvement may be
delusive but I think our impressing upon her the necessity of keeping
what has occurred a secret from papa and everybody helps to give her a
zest for life

Oct 8She is still mending I am glad to have saved hermy only
sisterif I have done so though I shall now never become Charless
wife



CHAPTER VIIA SURPRISE AWAITS HER


Feb 5Writing has been absolutely impossible for a long while but I
now reach a stage at which it seems possible to jot down a line
Carolines recovery extending over four months has been very
engrossing at first slow latterly rapid But a fearful complication of
affairs attends it

 O what a tangled web we weave
 When first we practise to deceive

Charles has written reproachfully to me from Venice where he is He
says how can he fulfil in the real what he has enacted in the
counterfeit while he still loves me Yet how on the other hand can he
leave it unfulfilled All this time I have not told her and up to this
minute she believes that he has indeed taken her for better for worse
till death them do part It is a harassing position for me and all
three In the awful approach of death ones judgment loses its balance
and we do anything to meet the exigencies of the moment with a single
eye to the one who excites our sympathy and from whom we seem on the
brink of being separated for ever

Had he really married her at that time all would be settled now But he
took too much thought she might have died and then he had his reason
If indeed it had turned out so I should now be perhaps a sad woman but
not a tempesttossed one    The possibility of his claiming me after
all is what lies at the root of my agitation Everything hangs by a
thread Suppose I tell her the marriage was a mockery suppose she is
indignant with me and with him for the deceptionand then Otherwise
suppose she is not indignant but forgives all he is bound to marry her
and honour constrains me to urge him thereto in spite of what he
protests and to smooth the way to this issue by my method of informing
her I have meant to tell her the last monthever since she has been
strong enough to bear such tidings but I have been without the powerthe
moral force Surely I must write and get him to come and assist me

March 14She continually wonders why he does not come the five months
of his enforced absence having expired and still more she wonders why he
does not write oftener His last letter was cold she says and she
fears he regrets his marriage which he may only have celebrated with her
for pitys sake thinking she was sure to die It makes ones heart
bleed to hear her hovering thus so near the truth and yet never
discerning its actual shape

A minor trouble besets me too in the person of the young Scripture
reader whose conscience pricks him for the part he played Surely I am
punished if ever woman were for a too ingenious perversion of her
better judgment

April 2She is practically well The faint pink revives in her cheek
though it is not quite so full as heretofore But she still wonders what
she can have done to offend her dear husband and I have been obliged
to tell the smallest part of the truthan unimportant fragment of the
whole in fact I said that I feared for the moment he might regret the
precipitancy of the act which her illness caused his affairs not having
been quite sufficiently advanced for marriage just then though he will
doubtless come to her as soon as he has a home ready Meanwhile I have
written to him peremptorily to come and relieve me in this awful
dilemma He will find no note of love in that

April 10To my alarm the letter I lately addressed to him at Venice
where he is staying as well as the last one she sent him have received
no reply She thinks he is ill I do not quite think that but I wish
we could hear from him Perhaps the peremptoriness of my words had
offended him it grieves me to think it possible I offend him But too
much of this I must tell her the truth or she may in her ignorance
commit herself to some course or other that may be ruinously
compromising She said plaintively just now that if he could see her
and know how occupied with him and him alone is her every waking hour
she is sure he would forgive her the wicked presumption of becoming his
wife Very sweet all that and touching I could not conceal my tears

April 15The house is in confusion my father is angry and distressed
and I am distracted Caroline has disappearedgone away secretly I
cannot help thinking that I know where she is gone to How guilty I
seem and how innocent she O that I had told her before now

1 oclockNo trace of her as yet We find also that the little waiting
maid we have here in training has disappeared with Caroline and there is
not much doubt that Caroline fearing to travel alone has induced this
girl to go with her as companion I am almost sure she has started in
desperation to find him and that Venice is her goal Why should she run
away if not to join her husband as she thinks him Now that I
consider there have been indications of this wish in her for days as in
birds of passage there lurk signs of their incipient intention and yet I
did not think she would have taken such an extreme step unaided and
without consulting me I can only jot down the bare factsI have no
time for reflections But fancy Caroline travelling across the continent
of Europe with a chit of a girl who will be more of a charge than an
assistance They will be a mark for every marauder who encounters them

Evening 8 oclockYes it is as I surmised She has gone to join him
A note posted by her in Budmouth Regis at daybreak has reached me this
afternoonthanks to the fortunate chance of one of the servants calling
for letters in town today or I should not have got it until tomorrow
She merely asserts her determination of going to him and has started
privately that nothing may hinder her stating nothing about her route
That such a gentle thing should suddenly become so calmly resolute quite
surprises me Alas he may have left Veniceshe may not find him for
weeksmay not at all

My father on learning the facts bade me at once have everything ready
by nine this evening in time to drive to the train that meets the night
steamboat This I have done and there being an hour to spare before we
start I relieve the suspense of waiting by taking up my pen He says
overtake her we must and calls Charles the hardest of names He
believes of course that she is merely an infatuated girl rushing off to
meet her lover and how can the wretched I tell him that she is more and
in a sense better than thatyet not sufficiently more and better to make
this flight to Charles anything but a still greater danger to her than a
mere lovers impulse We shall go by way of Paris and we think we may
overtake her there I hear my father walking restlessly up and down the
hall and can write no more



CHAPTER VIIISHE TRAVELS IN PURSUIT


April 16 Evening Paris Hotel There is no overtaking her at this
place but she has been here as I thought no other hotel in Paris being
known to her We go on tomorrow morning

April 18 VeniceA morning of adventures and emotions which leave me
sick and weary and yet unable to sleep though I have lain down on the
sofa of my room for more than an hour in the attempt I therefore make
up my diary to date in a hurried fashion for the sake of the riddance it
affords to ideas which otherwise remain suspended hotly in the brain

We arrived here this morning in broad sunlight which lit up the seagirt
buildings as we approached so that they seemed like a city of cork
floating raftlike on the smooth blue deep But I only glanced from the
carriage window at the lovely scene and we were soon across the
intervening water and inside the railway station When we got to the
front steps the row of black gondolas and the shouts of the gondoliers so
bewildered my father that he was understood to require two gondolas
instead of one with two oars and so I found him in one and myself in
another We got this righted after a while and were rowed at once to
the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni where M de la Feste had been
staying when we last heard from him the way being down the Grand Canal
for some distance under the Rialto and then by narrow canals which
eventually brought us under the Bridge of Sighsharmonious to our
moodsand out again into open water The scene was purity itself as to
colour but it was cruel that I should behold it for the first time under
such circumstances

As soon as I entered the hotel which is an oldfashioned place like
most places here where people are taken en pension as well as the
ordinary way I rushed to the framed list of visitors hanging in the
hall and in a moment I saw Charless name upon it among the rest But
she was our chief thought I turned to the hall porter andknowing
that she would have travelled as Madame de la FesteI asked for her
under that name without my father hearing He poor soul was making
confused inquiries outside the door about an English lady as if there
were not a score of English ladies at hand

She has just come said the porter Madame came by the very early
train this morning when Monsieur was asleep and she requested us not to
disturb him She is now in her room

Whether Caroline had seen us from the window or overheard me I do not
know but at that moment I heard footsteps on the bare marble stairs and
she appeared in person descending

Caroline I exclaimed why have you done this and rushed up to her

She did not answer but looked down to hide her emotion which she
conquered after the lapse of a few seconds putting on a practical tone
that belied her

I am just going to my husband she said I have not yet seen him I
have not been here long She condescended to give no further reason for
her movements and made as if to move on I implored her to come into a
private room where I could speak to her in confidence but she objected
However the diningroom close at hand was quite empty at this hour
and I got her inside and closed the door I do not know how I began my
explanation or how I ended it but I told her briefly and brokenly
enough that the marriage was not real

Not real she said vacantly

It is not said I You will find that it is all as I say

She could not believe my meaning even then Not his wife she cried
It is impossible What am I then

I added more details and reiterated the reason for my conduct as well as
I could but Heaven knows how very difficult I found it to feel a jot
more justification for it in my own mind than she did in hers

The revulsion of feeling as soon as she really comprehended all was
most distressing After her grief had in some measure spent itself she
turned against both him and me

Why should have I been deceived like this she demanded with a bitter
haughtiness of which I had not deemed such a tractable creature capable
Do you suppose that anything could justify such an imposition What O
what a snare you have spread for me

I murmured Your life seemed to require it but she did not hear me
She sank down in a chair covered her face and then my father came in
O here you are he said I could not find you And Caroline

And were you papa a party to this strange deed of kindness

To what said he

Then out it all came and for the first time he was made acquainted with
the fact that the scheme for soothing her illness which I had sounded
him upon had been really carried out In a moment he sided with
Caroline My repeated assurance that my motive was good availed less
than nothing In a minute or two Caroline arose and went abruptly out of
the room and my father followed her leaving me alone to my reflections

I was so bent upon finding Charles immediately that I did not notice
whither they went The servants told me that M de la Feste was just
outside smoking and one of them went to look for him I following but
before we had gone many steps he came out of the hotel behind me I
expected him to be amazed but he showed no surprise at seeing me though
he showed another kind of feeling to an extent which dismayed me I may
have revealed something similar but I struggled hard against all
emotion and as soon as I could I told him she had come He simply said
Yes in a low voice

You know it Charles said I

I have just learnt it he said

O Charles I went on having delayed completing your marriage with
her till now I fearit has become a serious position for us Why did
you not reply to our letters

I was purposing to reply in person I did not know how to address her on
the pointhow to address you But what has become of her

She has gone off with my father said I indignant with you and
scorning me

He was silent and I suggested that we should follow them pointing out
the direction which I fancied their gondola had taken As the one we got
into was doubly manned we soon came in view of their two figures ahead of
us while they were not likely to observe us our boat having the felze
on while theirs was uncovered They shot into a narrow canal just
beyond the Giardino Reale and by the time we were floating up between
its slimy walls we saw them getting out of their gondola at the steps
which lead up near the end of the Via 22 Marzo When we reached the same
spot they were walking up and down the Via in consultation Getting out
he stood on the lower steps watching them I watched him He seemed to
fall into a reverie

Will you not go and speak to her said I at length

He assented and went forward Still he did not hasten to join them
but screened by a projecting window observed their musing converse At
last he looked back at me whereupon I pointed forward and he in
obedience stepped out and met them face to face Caroline flushed hot
bowed haughtily to him turned away and taking my fathers arm
violently led him off before he had had time to use his own judgment
They disappeared into a narrow calle or alley leading to the back of
the buildings on the Grand Canal

M de la Feste came slowly back as he stepped in beside me I realized my
position so vividly that my heart might almost have been heard to beat
The third condition had arisenthe least expected by either of us She
had refused him he was free to claim me

We returned in the boat together He seemed quite absorbed till we had
turned the angle into the Grand Canal when he broke the silence She
spoke very bitterly to you in the salleamanger he said I do not
think she was quite warranted in speaking so to you who had nursed her
so tenderly

O but I think she was I answered It was there I told her what had
been done she did not know till then

She was very dignifiedvery striking he murmured You were more

But how do you know what passed between us said I He then told me
that he had seen and heard all The diningroom was divided by folding
doors from an inner portion and he had been sitting in the latter part
when we entered the outer so that our words were distinctly audible

But dear Alicia he went on I was more impressed by the affection of
your apology to her than by anything else And do you know that now the
conditions have arisen which give me liberty to consider you my
affianced I had been expecting this but yet was not prepared I
stammered out that we would not discuss it then

Why not said he Do you know that we may marry here and now She
has cast off both you and me

It cannot be said I firmly She has not been fairly asked to be
your wife in factto repeat the service lawfully and until that has
been done it would be grievous sin in me to accept you

I had not noticed where the gondoliers were rowing us I suppose he had
given them some direction unheard by me for as I resigned myself in
despairing indolence to the motion of the gondola I perceived that it
was taking us up the Canal and turning into a side opening near the
Palazzo Grimani drew up at some steps near the end of a large church

Where are we said I

It is the Church of the Frari he replied We might be married there
At any rate let us go inside and grow calm and decide what to do

When we had entered I found that whether a place to marry in or not it
was one to depress The word which Venice speaks most
constantlydecaywas in a sense accentuated here The whole large
fabric itself seemed sinking into an earth which was not solid enough to
bear it Cobwebbed cracks zigzagged the walls and similar webs clouded
the windowpanes A sicklysweet smell pervaded the aisles After
walking about with him a little while in embarrassing silences divided
only by his cursory explanations of the monuments and other objects and
almost fearing he might produce a marriage licence I went to a door in
the south transept which opened into the sacristy

I glanced through it towards the small altar at the upper end The
place was empty save of one figure and she was kneeling here in front of
the beautiful altarpiece by Bellini Beautiful though it was she seemed
not to see it She was weeping and praying as though her heart was
broken She was my sister Caroline I beckoned to Charles and he came
to my side and looked through the door with me

Speak to her said I She will forgive you

I gently pushed him through the doorway and went back into the transept
down the nave and onward to the west door There I saw my father to
whom I spoke He answered severely that having first obtained
comfortable quarters in a pension on the Grand Canal he had gone back to
the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni to find me but that I was not
there He was now waiting for Caroline to accompany her back to the
pension at which she had requested to be left to herself as much as
possible till she could regain some composure

I told him that it was useless to dwell on what was past that I no doubt
had erred that the remedy lay in the future and their marriage In this
he quite agreed with me and on my informing him that M de la Feste was
at that moment with Caroline in the sacristy he assented to my proposal
that we should leave them to themselves and return together to await
them at the pension where he had also engaged a room for me This we
did and going up to the chamber he had chosen for me which overlooked
the Canal I leant from the window to watch for the gondola that should
contain Charles and my sister

They were not long in coming I recognized them by the colour of her
sunshade as soon as they turned the bend on my right hand They were
side by side of necessity but there was no conversation between them
and I thought that she looked flushed and he pale When they were rowed
in to the steps of our house he handed her up I fancied she might have
refused his assistance but she did not Soon I heard her pass my door
and wishing to know the result of their interview I went downstairs
seeing that the gondola had not put off with him He was turning from
the door but not towards the water intending apparently to walk home by
way of the calle which led into the Via 22 Marzo

Has she forgiven you said I

I have not asked her he said

But you are bound to do so I told him

He paused and then said Alicia let us understand each other Do you
mean to tell me once for all that if your sister is willing to become
my wife you absolutely make way for her and will not entertain any
thought of what I suggested to you any more

I do tell you so said I with dry lips You belong to herhow can I
do otherwise

Yes it is so it is purely a question of honour he returned Very
well then honour shall be my word and not my love I will put the
question to her frankly if she says yes the marriage shall be But not
here It shall be at your own house in England

When said I

I will accompany her there he replied and it shall be within a week
of her return I have nothing to gain by delay But I will not answer
for the consequences

What do you mean said I He made no reply went away and I came back
to my room



CHAPTER IXSHE WITNESSES THE END


April 20 Milan 1030 pmWe are thus far on our way homeward I
being decidedly de trop travel apart from the rest as much as I can
Having dined at the hotel here I went out by myself regardless of the
proprieties for I could not stay in I walked at a leisurely pace along
the Via Allesandro Manzoni till my eye was caught by the grand Galleria
Vittorio Emanuele and I entered under the high glass arcades till I
reached the central octagon where I sat down on one of a group of chairs
placed there Becoming accustomed to the stream of promenaders I soon
observed seated on the chairs opposite Caroline and Charles This was
the first occasion on which I had seen them en teteatete since my
conversation with him She soon caught sight of me averted her eyes
then apparently abandoning herself to an impulse she jumped up from her
seat and came across to me We had not spoken to each other since the
meeting in Venice

Alicia she said sitting down by my side Charles asks me to forgive
you and I do forgive you

I pressed her hand with tears in my eyes and said And do you forgive
him

Yes said she shyly

And whats the result said I

We are to be married directly we reach home

This was almost the whole of our conversation she walked home with me
Charles following a little way behind though she kept turning her head
as if anxious that he should overtake us Honour and not love seemed
to ring in my ears So matters stand Caroline is again happy

April 25We have reached home Charles with us Events are now moving
in silent speed almost with velocity indeed and I sometimes feel
oppressed by the strange and preternatural ease which seems to accompany
their flow Charles is staying at the neighbouring town he is only
waiting for the marriage licence when obtained he is to come here be
quietly married to her and carry her off It is rather resignation than
content which sits on his face but he has not spoken a word more to me
on the burning subject or deviated one hairs breadth from the course he
laid down They may be happy in time to come I hope so But I cannot
shake off depression

May 6Eve of the wedding Caroline is serenely happy though not
blithe But there is nothing to excite anxiety about her I wish I
could say the same of him He comes and goes like a ghost and yet
nobody seems to observe this strangeness in his mien

I could not help being here for the ceremony but my absence would have
resulted in less disquiet on his part I believe However I may be
wrong in attributing causes my father simply says that Charles and
Caroline have as good a chance of being happy as other people Well to
morrow settles all

May 7They are married we have just returned from church Charles
looked so pale this morning that my father asked him if he was ill He
said No only a slight headache and we started for the church

There was no hitch or hindrance and the thing is done

4 pmThey ought to have set out on their journey by this time but
there is an unaccountable delay Charles went out halfanhour ago and
has not yet returned Caroline is waiting in the hall but I am
dreadfully afraid they will miss the train I suppose the trifling
hindrance is of no account and yet I am full of misgivings   

Sept 14Four months have passed only four months It seems like
years Can it be that only seventeen weeks ago I set on this paper the
fact of their marriage I am now an aged woman by comparison

On that never to be forgotten day we waited and waited and Charles did
not return At six oclock when poor little Caroline had gone back to
her room in a state of suspense impossible to describe a man who worked
in the watermeadows came to the house and asked for my father He had
an interview with him in the study My father then rang his bell and
sent for me I went down and I then learnt the fatal news Charles was
no more The waterman had been going to shut down the hatches of a weir
in the meads when he saw a hat on the edge of the pool below floating
round and round in the eddy and looking into the pool saw something
strange at the bottom He knew what it meant and lowering the hatches
so that the water was still could distinctly see the body It is
needless to write particulars that were in the newspapers at the time
Charles was brought to the house but he was dead

We all feared for Caroline and she suffered much but strange to say
her suffering was purely of the nature of deep grief which found relief
in sobbing and tears It came out at the inquest that Charles had been
accustomed to cross the meads to give an occasional halfcrown to an old
man who lived on the opposite hill who had once been a landscape painter
in an humble way till he lost his eyesight and it was assumed that he
had gone thither for the same purpose today and to bid him farewell On
this information the coroners jury found that his death had been caused
by misadventure and everybody believes to this hour that he was drowned
while crossing the weir to relieve the old man Except one she believes
in no accident After the stunning effect of the first news I thought
it strange that he should have chosen to go on such an errand at the last
moment and to go personally when there was so little time to spare
since any gift could have been so easily sent by another hand Further
reflection has convinced me that this step out of life was as much a part
of the days plan as was the wedding in the church hard by They were
the two halves of his complete intention when he gave me on the Grand
Canal that assurance which I shall never forget Very well then honour
shall be my word not love If she says Yes the marriage shall be

I do not know why I should have made this entry at this particular time
but it has occurred to me to do itto complete in a measure that part
of my desultory chronicle which relates to the lovestory of my sister
and Charles She lives on meekly in her grief and will probably outlive
it while Ibut never mind me



CHAPTER XSHE ADDS A NOTE LONG AFTER


Fiveyears laterI have lighted upon this old diary which it has
interested me to look over containing as it does records of the time
when life shone more warmly in my eye than it does now I am impelled to
add one sentence to round off its record of the past About a year ago
my sister Caroline after a persistent wooing accepted the hand and
heart of Theophilus Higham once the blushing young Scripture reader who
assisted at the substitute for a marriage I planned and now the fully
ordained curate of the next parish His penitence for the part he played
ended in love We have all now made atonement for our sins against her
may she be deceived no more

1887




THE GRAVE BY THE HANDPOST


I never pass through ChalkNewton without turning to regard the
neighbouring upland at a point where a lane crosses the lone straight
highway dividing this from the next parish a sight which does not fail
to recall the event that once happened there and though it may seem
superfluous at this date to disinter more memories of village history
the whispers of that spot may claim to be preserved

It was on a dark yet mild and exceptionally dry evening at Christmas
time according to the testimony of William Dewy of Mellstock Michael
Mail and others that the choir of ChalkNewtona large parish situate
about halfway between the towns of Ivel and Casterbridge and now a
railway stationleft their homes just before midnight to repeat their
annual harmonies under the windows of the local population The band of
instrumentalists and singers was one of the largest in the county and
unlike the smaller and finer Mellstock stringband which eschewed all
but the catgut it included brass and reed performers at full Sunday
services and reached all across the west gallery

On this night there were two or three violins two cellos a tenor viol
double bass hautboy clarionets serpent and seven singers It was
however not the choirs labours but what its members chanced to
witness that particularly marked the occasion

They had pursued their rounds for many years without meeting with any
incident of an unusual kind but tonight according to the assertions of
several there prevailed to begin with an exceptionally solemn and
thoughtful mood among two or three of the oldest in the band as if they
were thinking they might be joined by the phantoms of dead friends who
had been of their number in earlier years and now were mute in the
churchyard under flattening moundsfriends who had shown greater zest
for melody in their time than was shown in this or that some past voice
of a semitransparent figure might quaver from some bedroomwindow its
acknowledgment of their nocturnal greeting instead of a familiar living
neighbour Whether this were fact or fancy the younger members of the
choir met together with their customary thoughtlessness and buoyancy
When they had gathered by the stone stump of the cross in the middle of
the village near the White Horse Inn which they made their starting
point some one observed that they were full early that it was not yet
twelve oclock The local waits of those days mostly refrained from
sounding a note before Christmas morning had astronomically arrived and
not caring to return to their beer they decided to begin with some
outlying cottages in Sidlinch Lane where the people had no clocks and
would not know whether it were night or morning In that direction they
accordingly went and as they ascended to higher ground their attention
was attracted by a light beyond the houses quite at the top of the lane

The road from ChalkNewton to Broad Sidlinch is about two miles long and
in the middle of its course where it passes over the ridge dividing the
two villages it crosses at right angles as has been stated the lonely
monotonous old highway known as Long Ash Lane which runs straight as a
surveyors line many miles north and south of this spot on the
foundation of a Roman road and has often been mentioned in these
narratives Though now quite deserted and grassgrown at the beginning
of the century it was well kept and frequented by traffic The
glimmering light appeared to come from the precise point where the roads
intersected

I think I know what that mid mean one of the group remarked

They stood a few moments discussing the probability of the light having
origin in an event of which rumours had reached them and resolved to go
up the hill

Approaching the high land their conjectures were strengthened Long Ash
Lane cut athwart them right and left and they saw that at the junction
of the four ways under the handpost a grave was dug into which as
the choir drew nigh a corpse had just been thrown by the four Sidlinch
men employed for the purpose The cart and horse which had brought the
body thither stood silently by

The singers and musicians from ChalkNewton halted and looked on while
the gravediggers shovelled in and trod down the earth till the hole
being filled the latter threw their spades into the cart and prepared
to depart

Who mid ye be aburying there asked Lot Swanhills in a raised voice
Not the sergeant

The Sidlinch men had been so deeply engrossed in their task that they had
not noticed the lanterns of the ChalkNewton choir till now

Whatbe you the Newton carolsingers returned the representatives of
Sidlinch

Ay sure Can it be that it is old Sergeant Holway youve aburied
there

Tis so Youve heard about it then

The choir knew no particularsonly that he had shot himself in his apple
closet on the previous Sunday Nobody seemth to know what a did it
for a blieve Leastwise we dont know at ChalkNewton continued
Lot

O yes It all came out at the inquest

The singers drew close and the Sidlinch men pausing to rest after their
labours told the story It was all owing to that son of his poor old
man It broke his heart

But the son is a soldier surely now with his regiment in the East
Indies

Ay And it have been rough with the army over there lately Twas a
pity his father persuaded him to go But Luke shouldnt have twyted the
sergeant ot since a did it for the best

The circumstances in brief were these The sergeant who had come to
this lamentable end father of the young soldier who had gone with his
regiment to the East had been singularly comfortable in his military
experiences these having ended long before the outbreak of the great war
with France On his discharge after duly serving his time he had
returned to his native village and married and taken kindly to domestic
life But the war in which England next involved herself had cost him
many frettings that age and infirmity prevented him from being ever again
an active unit of the army When his only son grew to young manhood and
the question arose of his going out in life the lad expressed his wish
to be a mechanic But his father advised enthusiastically for the army

Trade is coming to nothing in these days he said And if the war
with the French lasts as it will trade will be still worse The army
Lukethats the thing for ee Twas the making of me and twill be
the making of you I hadnt half such a chance as youll have in these
splendid hotter times

Luke demurred for he was a homekeeping peaceloving youth But
putting respectful trust in his fathers judgment he at length gave way
and enlisted in the d Foot In the course of a few weeks he was sent
out to India to his regiment which had distinguished itself in the East
under General Wellesley

But Luke was unlucky News came home indirectly that he lay sick out
there and then on one recent day when his father was out walking the
old man had received tidings that a letter awaited him at Casterbridge
The sergeant sent a special messenger the whole nine miles and the
letter was paid for and brought home but though as he had guessed it
came from Luke its contents were of an unexpected tenor

The letter had been written during a time of deep depression Luke said
that his life was a burden and a slavery and bitterly reproached his
father for advising him to embark on a career for which he felt unsuited
He found himself suffering fatigues and illnesses without gaining glory
and engaged in a cause which he did not understand or appreciate If it
had not been for his fathers bad advice he Luke would now have been
working comfortably at a trade in the village that he had never wished to
leave

After reading the letter the sergeant advanced a few steps till he was
quite out of sight of everybody and then sat down on the bank by the
wayside

When he arose halfanhour later he looked withered and broken and from
that day his natural spirits left him Wounded to the quick by his sons
sarcastic stings he indulged in liquor more and more frequently His
wife had died some years before this date and the sergeant lived alone
in the house which had been hers One morning in the December under
notice the report of a gun had been heard on his premises and on
entering the neighbours found him in a dying state He had shot himself
with an old firelock that he used for scaring birds and from what he had
said the day before and the arrangements he had made for his decease
there was no doubt that his end had been deliberately planned as a
consequence of the despondency into which he had been thrown by his sons
letter The coroners jury returned a verdict of felo de se

Heres his sons letter said one of the Sidlinch men Twas found in
his fathers pocket You can see by the state ot how many times he read
it over Howsomever the Lords will be done since it must whether or
no

The grave was filled up and levelled no mound being shaped over it The
Sidlinch men then bade the ChalkNewton choir goodnight and departed
with the cart in which they had brought the sergeants body to the hill
When their tread had died away from the ear and the wind swept over the
isolated grave with its customary siffle of indifference Lot Swanhills
turned and spoke to old Richard Toller the hautboy player

Tis hard upon a man and he a wold sojer to serve en so Richard Not
that the sergeant was ever in a battle bigger than would go into a half
acre paddock thats true Still his soul ought to hae as good a chance
as another mans all the same hey

Richard replied that he was quite of the same opinion What dye say to
lifting up a carrel over his grave as tis Christmas and no hurry to
begin down in parish and twouldnt take up ten minutes and not a soul
up here to say us nay or know anything about it

Lot nodded assent The man ought to hae his chances he repeated

Ye may as well spet upon his grave for all the good we shall do en by
what we lift up now hes got so far said Notton the clarionet man and
professed sceptic of the choir But Im agreed if the rest be

They thereupon placed themselves in a semicircle by the newly stirred
earth and roused the dull air with the wellknown Number Sixteen of
their collection which Lot gave out as being the one he thought best
suited to the occasion and the mood

 He comes the prisoners to release
 In Satans bondage held

Jown itweve never played to a dead man afore said Ezra Cattstock
when having concluded the last verse they stood reflecting for a breath
or two But it do seem more merciful than to go away and leave en as
they tother fellers have done

Now backalong to Newton and by the time we get overright the pasons
twill be half after twelve said the leader

They had not however done more than gather up their instruments when
the wind brought to their notice the noise of a vehicle rapidly driven up
the same lane from Sidlinch which the gravediggers had lately retraced
To avoid being run over when moving on they waited till the benighted
traveller whoever he might be should pass them where they stood in the
wider area of the Cross

In half a minute the light of the lanterns fell upon a hired fly drawn
by a steaming and jaded horse It reached the handpost when a voice
from the inside cried Stop here The driver pulled rein The
carriage door was opened from within and there leapt out a private
soldier in the uniform of some line regiment He looked around and was
apparently surprised to see the musicians standing there

Have you buried a man here he asked

No We baint Sidlinch folk thank God we be Newton choir Though a
man is just buried here thats true and weve raised a carrel over the
poor mortals natomy Whatdo my eyes see before me young Luke Holway
that went wi his regiment to the East Indies or do I see his spirit
straight from the battlefield Be you the son that wrote the letter

Dontdont ask me The funeral is over then

There wer no funeral in a Christen manner of speaking Buts buried
sure enough You must have met the men going back in the empty cart

Like a dog in a ditch and all through me

He remained silent looking at the grave and they could not help pitying
him My friends he said I understand better now You have I
suppose in neighbourly charity sung peace to his soul I thank you
from my heart for your kind pity Yes I am Sergeant Holways miserable
sonIm the son who has brought about his fathers death as truly as if
I had done it with my own hand

No no Dont ye take on so young man Hed been naturally low for a
good while off and on so we hear

We were out in the East when I wrote to him Everything had seemed to
go wrong with me Just after my letter had gone we were ordered home
Thats how it is you see me here As soon as we got into barracks at
Casterbridge I heard o this    Damn me Ill dare to follow my
father and make away with myself too It is the only thing left to
do

Dont ye be rash Luke Holway I say again but try to make amends by
your future life And maybe your father will smile a smile down from
heaven upon ee for t

He shook his head I dont know about that he answered bitterly

Try and be worthy of your father at his best Tis not too late

Dye think not I fancy it is    Well Ill turn it over Thank
you for your good counsel Ill live for one thing at any rate Ill
move fathers body to a decent Christian churchyard if I do it with my
own hands I cant save his life but I can give him an honourable
grave He shant lie in this accursed place

Ay as our pason says tis a barbarous custom they keep up at
Sidlinch and ought to be done away wi The man a old soldier too
You see our pason is not like yours at Sidlinch

He says it is barbarous does he So it is cried the soldier Now
hearken my friends Then he proceeded to inquire if they would
increase his indebtedness to them by undertaking the removal privately
of the body of the suicide to the churchyard not of Sidlinch a parish
he now hated but of ChalkNewton He would give them all he possessed
to do it

Lot asked Ezra Cattstock what he thought of it

Cattstock the cello player who was also the sexton demurred and
advised the young soldier to sound the rector about it first Mid be he
would object and yet a midnt The pason o Sidlinch is a hard man I
own ye and a said if folk will kill theirselves in hot blood they must
take the consequences But ours dont think like that at all and might
allow it

Whats his name

The honourable and reverent Mr Oldham brother to Lord Wessex But you
neednt be afeard o en on that account Hell talk to ee like a common
man if so be you havent had enough drink to gie ee bad breath

O the same as formerly Ill ask him Thank you And that duty
done

What then

Theres war in Spain I hear our next move is there Ill try to show
myself to be what my father wished me I dont suppose I shallbut Ill
try in my feeble way That much I swearhere over his body So help me
God

Luke smacked his palm against the white handpost with such force that it
shook Yes theres war in Spain and another chance for me to be
worthy of father

So the matter ended that night That the private acted in one thing as
he had vowed to do soon became apparent for during the Christmas week
the rector came into the churchyard when Cattstock was there and asked
him to find a spot that would be suitable for the purpose of such an
interment adding that he had slightly known the late sergeant and was
not aware of any law which forbade him to assent to the removal the
letter of the rule having been observed But as he did not wish to seem
moved by opposition to his neighbour at Sidlinch he had stipulated that
the act of charity should be carried out at night and as privately as
possible and that the grave should be in an obscure part of the
enclosure You had better see the young man about it at once added
the rector

But before Ezra had done anything Luke came down to his house His
furlough had been cut short owing to new developments of the war in the
Peninsula and being obliged to go back to his regiment immediately he
was compelled to leave the exhumation and reinterment to his friends
Everything was paid for and he implored them all to see it carried out
forthwith

With this the soldier left The next day Ezra on thinking the matter
over again went across to the rectory struck with sudden misgiving He
had remembered that the sergeant had been buried without a coffin and he
was not sure that a stake had not been driven through him The business
would be more troublesome than they had at first supposed

Yes indeed murmured the rector I am afraid it is not feasible
after all

The next event was the arrival of a headstone by carrier from the nearest
town to be left at Mr Ezra Cattstocks all expenses paid The sexton
and the carrier deposited the stone in the formers outhouse and Ezra
left alone put on his spectacles and read the brief and simple
inscription

 HERE LYETH THE BODY OF SAMUEL HOLWAY LATE SERGEANT IN HIS MAJESTYS
 D REGIMENT OF FOOT WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE DECEMBER THE 20TH 180
 ERECTED BY L H
 I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON

Ezra again called at the riverside rectory The stone is come sir But
Im afeard we cant do it nohow

I should like to oblige him said the gentlemanly old incumbent And
I would forego all fees willingly Still if you and the others dont
think you can carry it out I am in doubt what to say

Well sir Ive made inquiry of a Sidlinch woman as to his burial and
what I thought seems true They buried en wi a new sixfoot hurdlesaul
droughs body from the sheeppen up in North Ewelease though they wont
own to it now And the question is Is the moving worth while
considering the awkwardness

Have you heard anything more of the young man

Ezra had only heard that he had embarked that week for Spain with the
rest of the regiment And if hes as desperate as a seemed we shall
never see him here in England again

It is an awkward case said the rector

Ezra talked it over with the choir one of whom suggested that the stone
might be erected at the crossroads This was regarded as impracticable
Another said that it might be set up in the churchyard without removing
the body but this was seen to be dishonest So nothing was done

The headstone remained in Ezras outhouse till growing tired of seeing
it there he put it away among the bushes at the bottom of his garden
The subject was sometimes revived among them but it always ended with
Considering how a was buried we can hardly make a job ot

There was always the consciousness that Luke would never come back an
impression strengthened by the disasters which were rumoured to have
befallen the army in Spain This tended to make their inertness
permanent The headstone grew green as it lay on its back under Ezras
bushes then a tree by the river was blown down and falling across the
stone cracked it in three pieces Ultimately the pieces became buried
in the leaves and mould

Luke had not been born a ChalkNewton man and he had no relations left
in Sidlinch so that no tidings of him reached either village throughout
the war But after Waterloo and the fall of Napoleon there arrived at
Sidlinch one day an English sergeantmajor covered with stripes and as
it turned out rich in glory Foreign service had so totally changed
Luke Holway that it was not until he told his name that the inhabitants
recognized him as the sergeants only son

He had served with unswerving effectiveness through the Peninsular
campaigns under Wellington had fought at Busaco Fuentes dOnore Ciudad
Rodrigo Badajoz Salamanca Vittoria Quatre Bras and Waterloo and had
now returned to enjoy a more than earned pension and repose in his native
district

He hardly stayed in Sidlinch longer than to take a meal on his arrival
The same evening he started on foot over the hill to ChalkNewton
passing the handpost and saying as he glanced at the spot Thank God
hes not there Nightfall was approaching when he reached the latter
village but he made straight for the churchyard On his entering it
there remained light enough to discern the headstones by and these he
narrowly scanned But though he searched the front part by the road and
the back part by the river what he sought he could not findthe grave
of Sergeant Holway and a memorial bearing the inscription I AM NOT
WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON

He left the churchyard and made inquiries The honourable and reverend
old rector was dead and so were many of the choir but by degrees the
sergeantmajor learnt that his father still lay at the crossroads in
Long Ash Lane

Luke pursued his way moodily homewards to do which in the natural
course he would be compelled to repass the spot there being no other
road between the two villages But he could not now go by that place
vociferous with reproaches in his fathers tones and he got over the
hedge and wandered deviously through the ploughed fields to avoid the
scene Through many a fight and fatigue Luke had been sustained by the
thought that he was restoring the family honour and making noble amends
Yet his father lay still in degradation It was rather a sentiment than
a fact that his fathers body had been made to suffer for his own
misdeeds but to his supersensitiveness it seemed that his efforts to
retrieve his character and to propitiate the shade of the insulted one
had ended in failure

He endeavoured however to shake off his lethargy and not liking the
associations of Sidlinch hired a small cottage at ChalkNewton which had
long been empty Here he lived alone becoming quite a hermit and
allowing no woman to enter the house

The Christmas after taking up his abode herein he was sitting in the
chimney corner by himself when he heard faint notes in the distance and
soon a melody burst forth immediately outside his own window it came
from the carolsingers as usual and though many of the old hands Ezra
and Lot included had gone to their rest the same old carols were still
played out of the same old books There resounded through the sergeant
majors windowshutters the familiar lines that the deceased choir had
rendered over his fathers grave

 He comes the prisoners to release
 In Satans bondage held

When they had finished they went on to another house leaving him to
silence and loneliness as before

The candle wanted snuffing but he did not snuff it and he sat on till
it had burnt down into the socket and made waves of shadow on the
ceiling

The Christmas cheerfulness of next morning was broken at breakfasttime
by tragic intelligence which went down the village like wind Sergeant
Major Holway had been found shot through the head by his own hand at the
crossroads in Long Ash Lane where his father lay buried

On the table in the cottage he had left a piece of paper on which he had
written his wish that he might be buried at the Cross beside his father
But the paper was accidentally swept to the floor and overlooked till
after his funeral which took place in the ordinary way in the
churchyard

Christmas 1897




ENTER A DRAGOON


I lately had a melancholy experience said the gentleman who is
answerable for the truth of this story It was that of going over a
doomed house with whose outside aspect I had long been familiara house
that is which by reason of age and dilapidation was to be pulled down
during the following week Some of the thatch brown and rotten as the
gills of old mushrooms had indeed been removed before I walked over
the building Seeing that it was only a very small housewhich is
usually called a cottageresidencesituated in a remote hamlet and
that it was not more than a hundred years old if so much I was led to
think in my progress through the hollow rooms with their cracked walls
and sloping floors what an exceptional number of abrupt family incidents
had taken place thereinto reckon only those which had come to my own
knowledge And no doubt there were many more of which I had never heard

It stood at the top of a garden stretching down to the lane or street
that ran through a hermitgroup of dwellings in Mellstock parish From a
green gate at the lower entrance over which the thorn hedge had been
shaped to an arch by constant clippings a gravel path ascended between
the box edges of once trim raspberry strawberry and vegetable plots
towards the front door This was in colour an ancient and bleached green
that could be rubbed off with the finger and it bore a small
longfeatured brass knocker covered with verdigris in its crevices For
some years before this eve of demolition the homestead had degenerated
and been divided into two tenements to serve as cottages for farm
labourers but in its prime it had indisputable claim to be considered
neat pretty and genteel

The variety of incidents above alluded to was mainly owing to the nature
of the tenure whereby the place had been occupied by families not quite
of the kind customary in such spotspeople whose circumstances
position or antecedents were more or less of a critical happygolucky
cast And of these residents the family whose term comprised the story I
wish to relate was that of Mr Jacob Paddock the marketgardener who
dwelt there for some years with his wife and grownup daughter



I


An evident commotion was agitating the premises which jerked busy sounds
across the front plot resembling those of a disturbed hive If a member
of the household appeared at the door it was with a countenance of
abstraction and concern

Evening began to bend over the scene and the other inhabitants of the
hamlet came out to draw water their common well being in the public road
opposite the garden and house of the Paddocks Having wound up their
bucketsfull respectively they lingered and spoke significantly together
From their words any casual listener might have gathered information of
what had occurred

The woodman who lived nearest the site of the story told most of the
tale Selina the daughter of the Paddocks opposite had been surprised
that afternoon by receiving a letter from her once intended husband then
a corporal but now a sergeantmajor of dragoons whom she had hitherto
supposed to be one of the slain in the Battle of the Alma two or three
years before

She picked up wien against her fathers wish as we know and before he
got his stripes their informant continued Not but that the man was
as hearty a feller as youd meet this side o London But Jacob you
see wished her to do better and one can understand it However she
was determined to stick to him at that time and for what happened she
was not much to blame so near as they were to matrimony when the war
broke out and spoiled all

Even the very pig had been killed for the wedding said a woman and
the barrel o beer ordered in O the man meant honourable enough But
to be off in two days to fight in a foreign countrytwas natural of her
father to say they should wait till he got back

And he never came murmured one in the shade

The war ended but her man never turned up again She was not sure he
was killed but was too proud or too timid to go and hunt for him

One reason why her father forgave her when he found out how matters
stood was as he said plain at the time that he liked the man and could
see that he meant to act straight So the old folks made the best of
what they couldnt mend and kept her there with em when some wouldnt
Time has proved seemingly that he did mean to act straight now that he
has writ to her that hes coming Shed have stuck to him all through
the time tis my belief if tother hadnt come along

At the time of the courtship resumed the woodman the regiment was
quartered in Casterbridge Barracks and he and she got acquainted by his
calling to buy a pennorth of ratheripes off that tree yonder in her
fathers orchardthough twas said he seed her over hedge as well as the
apples He declared twas a kind of apple he much fancied and he called
for a pennorth every day till the tree was cleared It ended in his
calling for her

Twas a thousand pities they didnt jine up at once and ha done wi it

Well better late than never if so be hell have her now But Lord
shed that faith in en that shed no more belief that he was alive when
a didnt come than that the undermost man in our churchyard was alive
Shed never have thought of another but for thatO no

Tis awkward altogether for her now

Still she hadnt married wi the new man Though to be sure she would
have committed it next week even the licence being got they say for
shed have no banns this time the first being so unfortunate

Perhaps the sergeantmajor will think hes released and go as he came

O not as I reckon Soldiers baint particular and shes a tidy piece
o furniture still What will happen is that shell have her soldier
and break off with the masterwheelwright licence or nodaze me if she
wont

In the progress of these desultory conjectures the form of another
neighbour arose in the gloom She nodded to the people at the well who
replied Gd night Mrs Stone as she passed through Mr Paddocks gate
towards his door She was an intimate friend of the latters household
and the group followed her with their eyes up the path and past the
windows which were now lighted up by candles inside



II


Mrs Stone paused at the door knocked and was admitted by Selinas
mother who took her visitor at once into the parlour on the left hand
where a table was partly spread for supper On the beaufet against the
wall stood probably the only object which would have attracted the eye of
a local stranger in an otherwise ordinarily furnished room a great plum
cake guarded as if it were a curiosity by a glass shade of the kind seen
in museumssquare with a wooden back like those enclosing stuffed
specimens of rare feather or fur This was the mummy of the cake
intended in earlier days for the weddingfeast of Selina and the soldier
which had been religiously and lovingly preserved by the former as a
testimony to her intentional respectability in spite of an untoward
subsequent circumstance which will be mentioned This relic was now as
dry as a brick and seemed to belong to a preexistent civilization Till
quite recently Selina had been in the habit of pausing before it daily
and recalling the accident whose consequences had thrown a shadow over
her life ever sincethat of which the waterdrawers had spokenthe
sudden news one morning that the Route had come for the th Dragoons
two days only being the interval before departure the hurried
consultation as to what should be done the second time of asking being
past but not the third and the decision that it would be unwise to
solemnize matrimony in such haphazard circumstances even if it were
possible which was doubtful

Before the fire the young woman in question was now seated on a low
stool in the stillness of reverie and a toddling boy played about the
floor around her

Ah Mrs Stone said Selina rising slowly How kind of you to come
in Youll bide to supper Mother has told you the strange news of
course

No But I heard it outside that is that youd had a letter from Mr
ClarkSergeantMajor Clark as they say he is nowand that hes coming
to make it up with ee

Yes coming tonightall the way from the north of England where hes
quartered I dont know whether Im happy orfrightened at it Of
course I always believed that if he was alive hed come and keep his
solemn vow to me But when it is printed that a man is killedwhat can
you think

It was printed

Why yes After the Battle of the Alma the book of the names of the
killed and wounded was nailed up against Casterbridge Town Hall door
Twas on a Saturday and I walked there o purpose to read and see for
myself for Id heard that his name was down There was a crowd of
people round the book looking for the names of relations and I can mind
that when they saw me they made way for meknowing that wed been just
going to be marriedand that as you may say I belonged to him Well
I reached up my arm and turned over the farrels of the book and under
the killed I read his surname but instead of John theyd printed
James and I thought twas a mistake and that it must be he Who
could have guessed there were two nearly of one name in one regiment

Wellhes coming to finish the wedding of ee as may be said so never
mind my dear Alls well that ends well

Thats what he seems to say But then he has not heard yet about Mr
Miller and thats what rather terrifies me Luckily my marriage with
him next week was to have been by licence and not banns as in Johns
case and it was not so well known on that account Still I dont know
what to think

Everything seems to come just twixt cup and lip with ee dont it now
Miss Paddock Two weddings broke offtis odd How came you to accept
Mr Miller my dear

Hes been so good and faithful Not minding about the child at all for
he knew the rights of the story Hes dearly fond o Johnny you
knowjust as if twere his ownisnt he my duck Do Mr Miller love
you or dont he

Iss An I love Mr Miller said the toddler

Well you see Mrs Stone he said hed make me a comfortable home and
thinking twould be a good thing for Johnny Mr Miller being so much
better off than me I agreed at last just as a widow mightwhich is
what I have always felt myself ever since I saw what I thought was
Johns name printed there I hope John will forgive me

So he will forgive ee since twas no manner of wrong to him He ought
to have sent ee a line saying twas another man

Selinas mother entered Weve not known of this an hour Mrs Stone
she said The letter was brought up from Lower Mellstock Postoffice by
one of the school children only this afternoon Mr Miller was coming
here this very night to settle about the wedding doings Hark Is that
your father Or is it Mr Miller already come

The footsteps entered the porch there was a brushing on the mat and the
door of the room sprung back to disclose a rubicund man about thirty
years of age of thriving mastermechanic appearance and obviously
comfortable temper On seeing the child and before taking any notice
whatever of the elders the comer made a noise like the crowing of a cock
and flapped his arms as if they were wings a method of entry which had
the unqualified admiration of Johnny

Yesit is he said Selina constrainedly advancing

Whatwere you all talking about me my dear said the genial young man
when he had finished his crowing and resumed human manners Why whats
the matter he went on You look struck all of a heap Mr Miller
spread an aspect of concern over his own face and drew a chair up to the
fire

O mother would you tell Mr Miller if he dont know

Mister Miller and going to be married in six days he interposed

Ahhe dont know it yet murmured Mrs Paddock

Know what

WellJohn Clarknow SergeantMajor Clarkwasnt shot at Alma after
all Twas another of almost the same name

Now thats interesting There were several cases like that

And hes home again and hes coming here tonight to see her

Whatever shall I say that he may not be offended with what Ive done
interposed Selina

But why should it matter if he be

O I must agree to be his wife if he forgives meof course I must

Must But why not say nay Selina even if he do forgive ee

O no How can I without being wicked You were very very kind Mr
Miller to ask me to have you no other man would have done it after what
had happened and I agreed even though I did not feel half so warm as I
ought Yet it was entirely owing to my believing him in the grave as I
knew that if he were not he would carry out his promise and this shows
that I was right in trusting him

Yes    He must be a goodish sort of fellow said Mr Miller for a
moment so impressed with the excellently faithful conduct of the sergeant
major of dragoons that he disregarded its effect upon his own position
He sighed slowly and added Well Selina tis for you to say I love
you and I love the boy and theres my chimneycorner and sticks o
furniture ready for ee both

Yes I know But I mustnt hear it any more now murmured Selina
quickly John will be here soon I hope hell see how it all was when
I tell him If so be I could have written it to him it would have been
better

You think he doesnt know a single word about our having been on the
brink ot But perhaps its the other wayhes heard of it and that may
have brought him

Ahperhaps he has she said brightening And already forgives me

If not speak out straight and fair and tell him exactly how it fell
out If hes a man hell see it

O hes a man true enough But I really do think I shant have to tell
him at all since youve put it to me that way

As it was now Johnnys bedtime he was carried upstairs and when Selina
came down again her mother observed with some anxiety I fancy Mr Clark
must be here soon if hes coming and that being so perhaps Mr Miller
wouldnt mindwishing us goodnight since you are so determined to
stick to your sergeantmajor A little bitterness bubbled amid the
closing words It would be less awkward Mr Miller not being hereif
he will allow me to say it

To be sure to be sure the masterwheelwright exclaimed with instant
conviction rising alertly from his chair Lord bless my soul he
said taking up his hat and stick and we to have been married in six
days But Selinayoure right You do belong to the childs father
since hes alive Ill try to make the best of it

Before the generous Miller had got further there came a knock to the door
accompanied by the noise of wheels

I thought I heard something driving up said Mrs Paddock

They heard Mr Paddock who had been smoking in the room opposite rise
and go to the door and in a moment a voice familiar enough to Selina was
audibly saying At last I am here againnot without many interruptions
How is it with ee Mr Paddock And how is she Thought never to see
me again I suppose

A step with a clink of spurs in it struck upon the entry floor

Danged if I baint catched murmured Mr Miller forgetting company
speech Never mindI may as well meet him here as elsewhere and I
should like to see the chap and make friends with en as he seems one o
the right sort He returned to the fireplace just as the sergeantmajor
was ushered in



III


He was a good specimen of the longservice soldier of those days a not
unhandsome man with a certain undemonstrative dignity which some might
have said to be partly owing to the stiffness of his uniform about his
neck the high stock being still worn He was much stouter than when
Selina had parted from him Although she had not meant to be
demonstrative she ran across to him directly she saw him and he held her
in his arms and kissed her

Then in much agitation she whispered something to him at which he seemed
to be much surprised

Hes just put to bed she continued You can go up and see him I
knew youd come if you were alive But I had quite gid you up for dead
Youve been home in England ever since the war ended

Yes dear

Why didnt you come sooner

Thats just what I ask myself Why was I such a sappy as not to hurry
here the first day I set foot on shore Well whod have thought ityou
are as pretty as ever

He relinquished her to peep upstairs a little way where by looking
through the ballusters he could see Johnnys cot just within an open
door On his stepping down again Mr Miller was preparing to depart

Now whats this I am sorry to see anybody going the moment Ive
come expostulated the sergeantmajor I thought we might make an
evening of it Theres a nine gallon cask o Phoenix beer outside in
the trap and a ham and half a rawmil cheese for I thought you might
be short o forage in a lonely place like this and it struck me we might
like to ask in a neighbour or two But perhaps it would be taking a
liberty

O no not at all said Mr Paddock who was now in the room in a
judicial measured manner Very thoughtful of ee only twas not
necessary for we had just laid in an extry stock of eatables and
drinkables in preparation for the coming event

Twas very kind upon my heart said the soldier to think me worth
such a jocund preparation since you could only have got my letter this
morning

Selina gazed at her father to stop him and exchanged embarrassed glances
with Miller Contrary to her hopes SergeantMajor Clark plainly did not
know that the preparations referred to were for something quite other
than his own visit

The movement of the horse outside and the impatient tapping of a whip
handle upon the vehicle reminded them that Clarks driver was still in
waiting The provisions were brought into the house and the cart
dismissed Miller with very little pressure indeed accepted an
invitation to supper and a few neighbours were induced to come in to
make up a cheerful party

During the laying of the meal and throughout its continuance Selina
who sat beside her first intended husband tried frequently to break the
news to him of her engagement to the othernow terminated so suddenly
and so happily for her heart and her sense of womanly virtue But the
talk ran entirely upon the late war and though fortified by half a horn
of the strong ale brought by the sergeantmajor she decided that she
might have a better opportunity when supper was over of revealing the
situation to him in private

Having supped Clark leaned back at ease in his chair and looked around
We used sometimes to have a dance in that other room after supper
Selina dear I recollect We used to clear out all the furniture into
this room before beginning Have you kept up such goings on

No not at all said his sweetheart sadly

We were not unlikely to revive it in a few days said Mr Paddock
But howsomever theres seemingly many a slip as the saying is

Yes Ill tell John all about that by and by interposed Selina at
which perceiving that the secret which he did not like keeping was to be
kept even yet her father held his tongue with some show of testiness

The subject of a dance having been broached to put the thought in
practice was the feeling of all Soon after the tables and chairs were
borne from the opposite room to this by zealous hands and two of the
villagers sent home for a fiddle and tambourine when the majority began
to tread a measure well known in that secluded vale Selina naturally
danced with the sergeantmajor not altogether to her fathers
satisfaction and to the real uneasiness of her mother both of whom
would have preferred a postponement of festivities till the rashly
anticipated relationship between their daughter and Clark in the past had
been made fact by the churchs ordinances They did not however
express a positive objection Mr Paddock remembering with
selfreproach that it was owing to his original strongly expressed
disapproval of Selinas being a soldiers wife that the wedding had been
delayed and finally hinderedwith worse consequences than were
expected and ever since the misadventure brought about by his government
he had allowed events to steer their own courses

My tails will surely catch in your spurs John murmured the daughter
of the house as she whirled around upon his arm with the rapt soul and
look of a somnambulist I didnt know we should dance or I would have
put on my other frock

Ill take care my love Weve danced here before Do you think your
father objects to me now Ive risen in rank I fancy hes still a
little against me

He has repented times enough

And so have I If I had married you then twould have saved many a
misfortune I have sometimes thought it might have been possible to rush
the ceremony through somehow before I left though we were only in the
second asking were we And even if I had come back straight here when
we returned from the Crimea and married you then how much happier I
should have been

Dear John to say that Why didnt you

Odilatoriness and want of thought and a fear of facing your father
after so long I was in hospital a great while you know But how
familiar the place seems again Whats that I saw on the beaufet in the
other room It never used to be there A sort of withered corpse of a
cakenot an old bridecake surely

Yes John ours Tis the very one that was made for our wedding three
years ago

Sakes alive Why time shuts up together and all between then and now
seems not to have been What became of that weddinggown that they were
making in this room I remembera bluish whitish frothy thing

I have that too

Really    Why Selina

Yes

Why not put it on now

Wouldnt it seem And yet O how I should like to It would remind
them all if we told them what it was how we really meant to be married
on that bygone day Her eyes were again laden with wet

Yes    The pity that we didntthe pity Moody mournfulness seemed
to hold silent awhile one not naturally taciturn Wellwill you he
said

I willthe next dance if mother dont mind

Accordingly just before the next figure was formed Selina disappeared
and speedily came downstairs in a creased and boxworn but still airy
and pretty muslin gown which was indeed the very one that had been
meant to grace her as a bride three years before

It is dreadfully oldfashioned she apologized

Not at all What a grand thought of mine Now lets tot again

She explained to some of them as he led her to the second dance what
the frock had been meant for and that she had put it on at his request
And again athwart and around the room they went

You seem the bride he said

But I couldnt wear this gown to be married in now she replied
ecstatically or I shouldnt have put it on and made it dusty It is
really too oldfashioned and so folded and fretted out you cant think
That was with my taking it out so many times to look at I have never
put it onnevertill now

Selina I am thinking of giving up the army Will you emigrate with me
to New Zealand Ive an uncle out there doing well and hed soon help
me to making a larger income The English army is glorious but it aint
altogether enriching

Of course anywhere that you decide upon Is it healthy there for
Johnny

A lovely climate And I shall never be happy in England    Aha he
concluded again with a bitterness of unexpected strength would to
Heaven I had come straight back here

As the dance brought round one neighbour after another the reunited pair
were thrown into juxtaposition with Bob Heartall among the rest who had
been called in one whose chronic expression was that he carried inside
him a joke on the point of bursting with its own vastness He took
occasion now to let out a little of its quality shaking his head at
Selina as he addressed her in an undertone

This is a bit of a topper to the bridegroom ho ho Twill teach en the
liberty youll expect when youve married en

What does he mean by a topper the sergeantmajor asked who not
being of local extraction despised the venerable local language and
also seemed to suppose bridegroom to be an anticipatory name for
himself I only hope I shall never be worse treated than youve treated
me tonight

Selina looked frightened He didnt mean you dear she said as they
moved on We thought perhaps you knew what had happened owing to your
coming just at this time Had youheard anything aboutwhat I
intended

Not a breathhow should Iaway up in Yorkshire It was by the merest
accident that I came just at this date to make peace with you for my
delay

I was engaged to be married to Mr Bartholomew Miller Thats what it
is I would have let ee know by letter but there was no time only
hearing from ee this afternoon    You wont desert me for it will
you John Because as you know I quite supposed you dead andand
Her eyes were full of tears of trepidation and he might have felt a sob
heaving within her



IV


The soldier was silent during two or three double bars of the tune When
were you to have been married to the said Mr Bartholomew Miller he
inquired

Quite soon

How soon

Next weekO yesjust the same as it was with you and me Theres a
strange fate of interruption hanging over me I sometimes think He had
bought the licence which I preferred so that it mightnt be likeours
But it made no difference to the fate of it

Had bought the licence The devil

Dont be angry dear John I didnt know

No no Im not angry

It was so kind of him considering

Yes    I see of course how natural your action wasnever thinking
of seeing me any more Is it the Mr Miller who is in this dance

Yes

Clark glanced round upon Bartholomew and was silent again for some
little while and she stole a look at him to find that he seemed
changed John you look ill she almost sobbed Tisnt me is it

O dear no Though I hadnt somehow expected it I cant find fault
with you for a momentand I dont    This is a deuce of a long dance
dont you think Weve been at it twenty minutes if a second and the
figure doesnt allow one much rest Im quite out of breath

They like them so dreadfully long here Shall we drop out Or Ill
stop the fiddler

O no no I think I can finish But although I look healthy enough I
have never been so strong as I formerly was since that long illness I
had in the hospital at Scutari

And I knew nothing about it

You couldnt dear as I didnt write What a fool I have been
altogether He gave a twitch as of one in pain I wont dance again
when this one is over The fact is I have travelled a long way today
and it seems to have knocked me up a bit

There could be no doubt that the sergeantmajor was unwell and Selina
made herself miserable by still believing that her story was the cause of
his ailment Suddenly he said in a changed voice and she perceived that
he was paler than ever I must sit down

Letting go her waist he went quickly to the other room She followed
and found him in the nearest chair his face bent down upon his hands and
arms which were resting on the table

Whats the matter said her father who sat there dozing by the fire

John isnt well    We are going to New Zealand when we are married
father A lovely country John would you like something to drink

A drop o that Schiedam of old Owletts thats under stairs perhaps
suggested her father Not that nowadays tis much better than licensed
liquor

John she said putting her face close to his and pressing his arm
Will you have a drop of spirits or something

He did not reply and Selina observed that his ear and the side of his
face were quite white Convinced that his illness was serious a growing
dismay seized hold of her The dance ended her mother came in and
learning what had happened looked narrowly at the sergeantmajor

We must not let him lie like that lift him up she said Let him
rest in the windowbench on some cushions

They unfolded his arms and hands as they lay clasped upon the table and
on lifting his head found his features to bear the very impress of death
itself Bartholomew Miller who had now come in assisted Mr Paddock to
make a comfortable couch in the windowseat where they stretched out
Clark upon his back

Still he seemed unconscious We must get a doctor said Selina O
my dear John how is it you be taken like this

My impression is that hes dead murmured Mr Paddock He dont
breathe enough to move a tomtits feather

There were plenty to volunteer to go for a doctor but as it would be at
least an hour before he could get there the case seemed somewhat
hopeless The dancingparty ended as unceremoniously as it had begun
but the guests lingered round the premises till the doctor should arrive
When he did come the sergeantmajors extremities were already cold and
there was no doubt that death had overtaken him almost at the moment that
he had sat down

The medical practitioner quite refused to accept the unhappy Selinas
theory that her revelation had in any way induced Clarks sudden
collapse Both he and the coroner afterwards who found the immediate
cause to be heartfailure held that such a supposition was unwarranted
by facts They asserted that a long days journey a hurried drive and
then an exhausting dance were sufficient for such a result upon a heart
enfeebled by fatty degeneration after the privations of a Crimean winter
and other trying experiences the coincidence of the sad event with any
disclosure of hers being a pure accident

This conclusion however did not dislodge Selinas opinion that the
shock of her statement had been the immediate stroke which had felled a
constitution so undermined



V


At this date the Casterbridge Barracks were cavalry quarters their
adaptation to artillery having been effected some years later It had
been owing to the fact that the th Dragoons in which John Clark had
served happened to be lying there that Selina made his acquaintance At
the time of his death the barracks were occupied by the Scots Greys but
when the pathetic circumstances of the sergeantmajors end became known
in the town the officers of the Greys offered the services of their fine
reed and brass band that he might have a funeral marked by due military
honours His body was accordingly removed to the barracks and carried
thence to the churchyard in the Durnover quarter on the following
afternoon one of the Greys most ancient and docile chargers being
blacked up to represent Clarks horse on the occasion

Everybody pitied Selina whose story was well known She followed the
corpse as the only mourner Clark having been without relations in this
part of the country and a communication with his regiment having brought
none from a distance She sat in a little shabby brownblack mourning
carriage squeezing herself up in a corner to be as much as possible out
of sight during the slow and dramatic march through the town to the tune
from Saul When the interment had taken place the volleys been fired
and the return journey begun it was with something like a shock that she
found the military escort to be moving at a quick march to the lively
strains of Off she goes as if all care for the sergeantmajor was
expected to be ended with the late discharge of the carbines It was by
chance the very tune to which they had been footing when he died and
unable to bear its notes she hastily told her driver to drop behind The
band and military party diminished up the High Street and Selina turned
over Swan bridge and homeward to Mellstock

Then recommenced for her a life whose incidents were precisely of a suit
with those which had preceded the soldiers return but how different in
her appreciation of them Her narrow miss of the recovered
respectability they had hoped for from that tardy event worked upon her
parents as an irritant and after the first week or two of her mourning
her life with them grew almost insupportable She had impulsively taken
to herself the weeds of a widow for such she seemed to herself to be
and clothed little Johnny in sables likewise This assumption of a moral
relationship to the deceased which she asserted to be only not a legal
one by two most unexpected accidents led the old people to indulge in
sarcasm at her expense whenever they beheld her attire though all the
while it cost them more pain to utter than it gave her to hear it Having
become accustomed by her residence at home to the business carried on by
her father she surprised them one day by going off with the child to
ChalkNewton in the direction of the town of Ivell and opening a
miniature fruit and vegetable shop attending Ivell market with her
produce Her business grew somewhat larger and it was soon sufficient
to enable her to support herself and the boy in comfort She called
herself Mrs John Clark from the day of leaving home and painted the
name on her signboardno man forbidding her

By degrees the pain of her state was forgotten in her new circumstances
and getting to be generally accepted as the widow of a sergeantmajor of
dragoonsan assumption which her modest and mournful demeanour seemed to
substantiateher life became a placid one her mind being nourished by
the melancholy luxury of dreaming what might have been her future in New
Zealand with John if he had only lived to take her there Her only
travels now were a journey to Ivell on marketdays and once a fortnight
to the churchyard in which Clark lay there to tend with Johnnys
assistance as widows are wont to do the flowers she had planted upon
his grave

On a day about eighteen months after his unexpected decease Selina was
surprised in her lodging over her little shop by a visit from Bartholomew
Miller He had called on her once or twice before on which occasions he
had used without a word of comment the name by which she was known

Ive come this time he said less because I was in this direction
than to ask you Mrs Clark what you mid well guess Ive come o
purpose in short

She smiled

Tis to ask me again to marry you

Yes of course You see his coming back for ee proved what I always
believed of ee though others didnt Theres nobody but would be glad
to welcome you to our parish again now youve showed your independence
and acted up to your trust in his promise Well my dear will you
come

Id rather bide as Mrs Clark I think she answered I am not
ashamed of my position at all for I am Johns widow in the eyes of
Heaven

I quite agreethats why Ive come Still you wont like to be always
straining at this shopkeeping and marketstanding and twould be better
for Johnny if you had nothing to do but tend him

He here touched the only weak spot in Selinas resistance to his
proposalthe good of the boy To promote that there were other men she
might have married offhand without loving them if they had asked her to
but though she had known the worthy speaker from her youth she could not
for the moment fancy herself happy as Mrs Miller

He paused awhile I ought to tell ee Mrs Clark he said by and by
that marrying is getting to be a pressing question with me Not on my
own account at all The truth is that mother is growing old and I am
away from home a good deal so that it is almost necessary there should
be another person in the house with her besides me Thats the practical
consideration which forces me to think of taking a wife apart from my
wish to take you and you know theres nobody in the world I care for so
much

She said something about there being far better women than she and other
natural commonplaces but assured him she was most grateful to him for
feeling what he felt as indeed she sincerely was However Selina would
not consent to be the useful third person in his comfortable homeat any
rate just then He went away after taking tea with her without
discerning much hope for him in her goodbye



VI


After that evening she saw and heard nothing of him for a great while
Her fortnightly journeys to the sergeantmajors grave were continued
whenever weather did not hinder them and Mr Miller must have known she
thought of this custom of hers But though the churchyard was not
nearly so far from his homestead as was her shop at ChalkNewton he
never appeared in the accidental way that lovers use

An explanation was forthcoming in the shape of a letter from her mother
who casually mentioned that Mr Bartholomew Miller had gone away to the
other side of ShottsfordForum to be married to a thriving dairymans
daughter that he knew there His chief motive it was reported had been
less one of love than a wish to provide a companion for his aged mother

Selina was practical enough to know that she had lost a good and possibly
the only opportunity of settling in life after what had happened and for
a moment she regretted her independence But she became calm on
reflection and to fortify herself in her course started that afternoon
to tend the sergeantmajors grave in which she took the same sober
pleasure as at first

On reaching the churchyard and turning the corner towards the spot as
usual she was surprised to perceive another woman also apparently a
respectable widow and with a tiny boy by her side bending over Clarks
turf and spudding up with the point of her umbrella some ivyroots that
Selina had reverently planted there to form an evergreen mantle over the
mound

What are you digging up my ivy for cried Selina rushing forward so
excitedly that Johnny tumbled over a grave with the force of the tug she
gave his hand in her sudden start

Your ivy said the respectable woman

Why yes I planted it thereon my husbands grave

Your husbands

Yes The late SergeantMajor Clark Anyhow as good as my husband for
he was just going to be

Indeed But who may be my husband if not he I am the only Mrs John
Clark widow of the late SergeantMajor of Dragoons and this is his only
son and heir

How can that be faltered Selina her throat seeming to stick together
as she just began to perceive its possibility He had beengoing to
marry me twiceand we were going to New Zealand

AhI remember about you returned the legitimate widow calmly and not
unkindly You must be Selina he spoke of you now and then and said
that his relations with you would always be a weight on his conscience
Well the history of my life with him is soon told When he came back
from the Crimea he became acquainted with me at my home in the north and
we were married within a month of first knowing each other
Unfortunately after living together a few months we could not agree
and after a particularly sharp quarrel in which perhaps I was most in
the wrongas I dont mind owning here by his gravesidehe went away
from me declaring he would buy his discharge and emigrate to New
Zealand and never come back to me any more The next thing I heard was
that he had died suddenly at Mellstock at some low carouse and as he had
left me in such anger to live no more with me I wouldnt come down to
his funeral or do anything in relation to him Twas temper I know
but that was the fact Even if we had parted friends it would have been
a serious expense to travel three hundred miles to get there for one who
wasnt left so very well off    I am sorry I pulled up your ivyroots
but that common sort of ivy is considered a weed in my part of the
country

December 1899




A TRYST AT AN ANCIENT EARTH WORK


At ones every step forward it rises higher against the south sky with
an obtrusive personality that compels the senses to regard it and
consider The eyes may bend in another direction but never without the
consciousness of its heavy highshouldered presence at its point of
vantage Across the intervening levels the gale races in a straight line
from the fort as if breathed out of it hitherward With the shifting of
the clouds the faces of the steeps vary in colour and in shade broad
lights appearing where mist and vagueness had prevailed dissolving in
their turn into melancholy gray which spreads over and eclipses the
luminous bluffs In this sothought immutable spectacle all is change

Out of the invisible marine region on the other side birds soar suddenly
into the air and hang over the summits of the heights with the
indifference of long familiarity Their forms are white against the
tawny concave of cloud and the curves they exhibit in their floating
signify that they are seagulls which have journeyed inland from expected
stress of weather As the birds rise behind the fort so do the clouds
rise behind the birds almost as it seems stroking with their bagging
bosoms the uppermost flyers

The profile of the whole stupendous ruin as seen at a distance of a mile
eastward is cleanly cut as that of a marble inlay It is varied with
protuberances which from hereabouts have the animal aspect of warts
wens knuckles and hips It may indeed be likened to an enormous many
limbed organism of an antediluvian timepartaking of the cephalopod in
shapelying lifeless and covered with a thin green cloth which hides
its substance while revealing its contour This dull green mantle of
herbage stretches down towards the levels where the ploughs have essayed
for centuries to creep up near and yet nearer to the base of the castle
but have always stopped short before reaching it The furrows of these
environing attempts show themselves distinctly bending to the incline as
they trench upon it mounting in steeper curves till the steepness
baffles them and their parallel threads show like the striae of waves
pausing on the curl The peculiar place of which these are some of the
features is MaiDun The Castle of the Great Hill said to be the
Dunium of Ptolemy the capital of the Durotriges which eventually came
into Roman occupation and was finally deserted on their withdrawal from
the island

    

The evening is followed by a night on which an invisible moon bestows a
subdued yet pervasive lightwithout radiance as without blackness
From the spot whereon I am ensconced in a cottage a mile away the fort
has now ceased to be visible yet as by day to anybody whose thoughts
have been engaged with it and its barbarous grandeurs of past time the
form asserts its existence behind the night gauzes as persistently as if
it had a voice Moreover the southwest wind continues to feed the
intervening arable flats with vapours brought directly from its sides

The midnight hour for which there has been occasion to wait at length
arrives and I journey towards the stronghold in obedience to a request
urged earlier in the day It concerns an appointment which I rather
regret my decision to keep now that night is come The route thither is
hedgeless and treelessI need not add deserted The moonlight is
sufficient to disclose the pale ribandlike surface of the way as it
trails along between the expanses of darker fallow Though the road
passes near the fortress it does not conduct directly to its fronts As
the place is without an inhabitant so it is without a trackway So
presently leaving the macadamized road to pursue its course elsewhither
I step off upon the fallow and plod stumblingly across it The castle
looms out off the shade by degrees like a thing waking up and asking
what I want there It is now so enlarged by nearness that its whole
shape cannot be taken in at one view The ploughed ground ends as the
rise sharpens the sloping basement of grass begins and I climb upward
to invade MaiDun

Impressive by day as this largest AncientBritish work in the kingdom
undoubtedly is its impressiveness is increased now After standing
still and spending a few minutes in adding its age to its size and its
size to its solitude it becomes appallingly mournful in its growing
closeness A squally wind blows in the face with an impact which
proclaims that the vapours of the air sail low tonight The slope that
I so laboriously clamber up the wind skips sportively down Its track
can be discerned even in this light by the undulations of the withered
grassbentsthe only produce of this upland summit except moss Four
minutes of ascent and a vantageground of some sort is gained It is
only the crest of the outer rampart Immediately within this a chasm
gapes its bottom is imperceptible but the counterscarp slopes not too
steeply to admit of a sliding descent if cautiously performed The shady
bottom dank and chilly is thus gained and reveals itself as a kind of
winding lane wide enough for a waggon to pass along floored with rank
herbage and trending away right and left into obscurity between the
concentric walls of earth The towering closeness of these on each hand
their impenetrability and their ponderousness are felt as a physical
pressure The way is now up the second of them which stands steeper and
higher than the first To turn aside as did Christians companion from
such a Hill Difficulty is the more natural tendency but the way to the
interior is upward There is of course an entrance to the fortress
but that lies far off on the other side It might possibly have been the
wiser course to seek for easier ingress there

However being here I ascend the second acclivity The grass stemsthe
grey beard of the hillsway in a mass close to my stooping face The
dead heads of these various grassesfescues foxtails and ryesbob
and twitch as if pulled by a string underground From a few thistles a
whistling proceeds and even the moss speaks in its humble way under
the stress of the blast

That the summit of the second line of defence has been gained is suddenly
made known by a contrasting wind from a new quarter coming over with the
curve of a cascade These novel gusts raise a sound from the whole camp
or castle playing upon it bodily as upon a harp It is with some
difficulty that a foothold can be preserved under their sweep Looking
aloft for a moment I perceive that the sky is much more overcast than it
has been hitherto and in a few instants a dead lull in what is now a
gale ensues with almost preternatural abruptness I take advantage of
this to sidle down the second counterscarp but by the time the ditch is
reached the lull reveals itself to be but the precursor of a storm It
begins with a heave of the whole atmosphere like the sigh of a weary
strong man on turning to recommence unusual exertion just as I stand
here in the second fosse That which now radiates from the sky upon the
scene is not so much light as vaporous phosphorescence

The wind quickening abandons the natural direction it has pursued on
the open upland and takes the course of the gorges length rushing
along therein helterskelter and carrying thick rain upon its back The
rain is followed by hailstones which fly through the defile in
battalionsrolling hopping ricochetting snapping clattering down the
shelving banks in an undefinable haze of confusion The earthen sides of
the fosse seem to quiver under the drenching onset though it is
practically no more to them than the blows of Thor upon the giant of
Jotunland It is impossible to proceed further till the storm somewhat
abates and I draw up behind a spur of the inner scarp where possibly a
barricade stood two thousand years ago and thus await events

    

The roar of the storm can be heard travelling the complete circuit of the
castlea measured milecoming round at intervals like a
circumambulating column of infantry Doubtless such a column has passed
this way in its time but the only columns which enter in these latter
days are the columns of sheep and oxen that are sometimes seen here now
while the only semblance of heroic voices heard are the utterances of
such and of the many winds which make their passage through the ravines

The expected lightning radiates round and a rumbling as from its
subterranean vaultsif there are anyfills the castle The lightning
repeats itself and coming after the aforesaid thoughts of martial men
it bears a fanciful resemblance to swords moving in combat It has the
very brassy hue of the ancient weapons that here were used The so
sudden entry upon the scene of this metallic flame is as the entry of a
presiding exhibitor who unrolls the maps uncurtains the pictures
unlocks the cabinets and effects a transformation by merely exposing the
materials of his science unintelligibly cloaked till then The abrupt
configuration of the bluffs and mounds is now for the first time clearly
revealedmounds whereon doubtless spears and shields have frequently
lain while their owners loosened their sandals and yawned and stretched
their arms in the sun For the first time too a glimpse is obtainable
of the true entrance used by its occupants of old some way ahead

There where all passage has seemed to be inviolably barred by an almost
vertical facade the ramparts are found to overlap each other like
loosely clasped fingers between which a zigzag path may be followeda
cunning construction that puzzles the uninformed eye But its cunning
even where not obscured by dilapidation is now wasted on the solitary
forms of a few wild badgers rabbits and hares Men must have often
gone out by those gates in the morning to battle with the Roman legions
under Vespasian some to return no more others to come back at evening
bringing with them the noise of their heroic deeds But not a page not
a stone has preserved their fame

    

Acoustic perceptions multiply tonight We can almost hear the stream of
years that have borne those deeds away from us Strange articulations
seem to float on the air from that point the gateway where the
animation in past times must frequently have concentrated itself at hours
of coming and going and general excitement There arises an
ineradicable fancy that they are human voices if so they must be the
lingering airborne vibrations of conversations uttered at least fifteen
hundred years ago The attention is attracted from mere nebulous
imaginings about yonder spot by a real moving of something close at hand

I recognize by the now moderate flashes of lightning which are sheet
like and nearly continuous that it is the gradual elevation of a small
mound of earth At first no larger than a mans fist it reaches the
dimensions of a hat then sinks a little and is still It is but the
heaving of a mole who chooses such weather as this to work in from some
instinct that there will be nobody abroad to molest him As the fine
earth lifts and lifts and falls loosely aside fragments of burnt clay
roll out of itclay that once formed part of cups or other vessels used
by the inhabitants of the fortress

The violence of the storm has been counterbalanced by its transitoriness
From being immersed in wellnigh solid media of cloud and hail shot with
lightning I find myself uncovered of the humid investiture and left bare
to the mild gaze of the moon which sparkles now on every wet grassblade
and frond of moss

But I am not yet inside the fort and the delayed ascent of the third and
last escarpment is now made It is steeper than either The first was a
surface to walk up the second to stagger up the third can only be
ascended on the hands and toes On the summit obtrudes the first
evidence which has been met with in these precincts that the time is
really the nineteenth century it is in the form of a white noticeboard
on a post and the wording can just be discerned by the rays of the
setting moon

CAUTIONAny Person found removing Relics Skeletons Stones Pottery
Tiles or other Material from this Earthwork or cutting up the Ground
will be Prosecuted as the Law directs

Here one observes a difference underfoot from what has gone before
scraps of Roman tile and stone chippings protrude through the grass in
meagre quantity but sufficient to suggest that masonry stood on the
spot Before the eye stretches under the moonlight the interior of the
fort So open and so large is it as to be practically an upland plateau
and yet its area lies wholly within the walls of what may be designated
as one building It is a longviolated retreat all its cornerstones
plinths and architraves were carried away to build neighbouring villages
even before mediaeval or modern history began Many a block which once
may have helped to form a bastion here rests now in broken and diminished
shape as part of the chimneycorner of some shepherds cottage within the
distant horizon and the cornerstones of this heathen altar may form the
basecourse of some adjoining village church

Yet the very bareness of these inner courts and wards their condition of
mere pasturage protects what remains of them as no defences could do
Nothing is left visible that the hands can seize on or the weather
overturn and a permanence of general outline at least results which no
other condition could ensure

The position of the castle on this isolated hill bespeaks deliberate and
strategic choice exercised by some remote mind capable of prospective
reasoning to a far extent The natural configuration of the surrounding
country and its bearing upon such a stronghold were obviously long
considered and viewed mentally before its extensive design was carried
into execution Who was the man that said Let it be built herenot
on that hill yonder or on that ridge behind but on this best spot of
all Whether he were some great one of the Belgae or of the Durotriges
or the travelling engineer of Britains united tribes must for ever
remain times secret his form cannot be realized nor his countenance
nor the tongue that he spoke when he set down his foot with a thud and
said Let it be here

Within the innermost enclosure though it is so wide that at a
superficial glance the beholder has only a sense of standing on a breezy
down the solitude is rendered yet more solitary by the knowledge that
between the benighted sojourner herein and all kindred humanity are those
three concentric walls of earth which no being would think of scaling on
such a night as this even were he to hear the most pathetic cries
issuing hence that could be uttered by a spectrechased soul I reach a
central mound or platformthe crown and axis of the whole structure The
view from here by day must be of almost limitless extent On this raised
floor dais or rostrum harps have probably twanged more or less tuneful
notes in celebration of daring strength or cruelty of worship
superstition love birth and death of simple lovingkindness perhaps
never Many a time must the king or leader have directed his keen eyes
hence across the open lands towards the ancient road the Icening Way
still visible in the distance on the watch for armed companies
approaching either to succour or to attack

I am startled by a voice pronouncing my name Past and present have
become so confusedly mingled under the associations of the spot that for
a time it has escaped my memory that this mound was the place agreed on
for the aforesaid appointment I turn and behold my friend He stands
with a dark lantern in his hand and a spade and light pickaxe over his
shoulder He expresses both delight and surprise that I have come I
tell him I had set out before the bad weather began

He to whom neither weather darkness nor difficulty seems to have any
relation or significance so entirely is his soul wrapped up in his own
deep intentions asks me to take the lantern and accompany him I take
it and walk by his side He is a man about sixty small in figure with
grey oldfashioned whiskers cut to the shape of a pair of crumbbrushes
He is entirely in black broadclothor rather at present black and
brown for he is bespattered with mud from his heels to the crown of his
low hat He has no consciousness of thisno sense of anything but his
purpose his ardour for which causes his eyes to shine like those of a
lynx and gives his motions all the elasticity of an athletes

Nobody to interrupt us at this time of night he chuckles with fierce
enjoyment

We retreat a little way and find a sort of angle an elevation in the
sod a suggested squareness amid the mass of irregularities around Here
he tells me if anywhere the kings house stood Three months of
measurement and calculation have confirmed him in this conclusion

He requests me now to open the lantern which I do and the light streams
out upon the wet sod At last divining his proceedings I say that I had
no idea in keeping the tryst that he was going to do more at such an
unusual time than meet me for a meditative ramble through the stronghold
I ask him why having a practicable object he should have minded
interruptions and not have chosen the day He informs me quietly
pointing to his spade that it was because his purpose is to dig then
signifying with a grim nod the gaunt noticepost against the sky beyond
I inquire why as a professed and wellknown antiquary with capital
letters at the tail of his name he did not obtain the necessary
authority considering the stringent penalties for this sort of thing
and he chuckles fiercely again with suppressed delight and says
Because they wouldnt have given it

He at once begins cutting up the sod and as he takes the pickaxe to
follow on with assures me that penalty or no penalty honest men or
marauders he is sure of one thing that we shall not be disturbed at our
work till after dawn

I remember to have heard of men who in their enthusiasm for some special
science art or hobby have quite lost the moral sense which would
restrain them from indulging it illegitimately and I conjecture that
here at last is an instance of such an one He probably guesses the
way my thoughts travel for he stands up and solemnly asserts that he has
a distinctly justifiable intention in this matter namely to uncover to
search to verify a theory or displace it and to cover up again He
means to take away nothingnot a grain of sand In this he says he sees
no such monstrous sin I inquire if this is really a promise to me He
repeats that it is a promise and resumes digging My contribution to
the labour is that of directing the light constantly upon the hole When
he has reached something more than a foot deep he digs more cautiously
saying that be it much or little there it will not lie far below the
surface such things never are deep A few minutes later the point of
the pickaxe clicks upon a stony substance He draws the implement out as
feelingly as if it had entered a mans body Taking up the spade he
shovels with care and a surface level as an altar is presently
disclosed His eyes flash anew he pulls handfuls of grass and mops the
surface clean finally rubbing it with his handkerchief Grasping the
lantern from my hand he holds it close to the ground when the rays
reveal a complete mosaica pavement of minute tesserae of many colours
of intricate pattern a work of much art of much time and of much
industry He exclaims in a shout that he knew it alwaysthat it is not
a Celtic stronghold exclusively but also a Roman the former people
having probably contributed little more than the original framework which
the latter took and adapted till it became the present imposing
structure

I ask What if it is Roman

A great deal according to him That it proves all the world to be wrong
in this great argument and himself alone to be right Can I wait while
he digs further

I agreereluctantly but he does not notice my reluctance At an
adjoining spot he begins flourishing the tools anew with the skill of a
navvy this venerable scholar with letters after his name Sometimes he
falls on his knees burrowing with his hands in the manner of a hare and
where his oldfashioned broadcloth touches the sides of the hole it gets
plastered with the damp earth He continually murmurs to himself how
important how very important this discovery is He draws out an
object we wash it in the same primitive way by rubbing it with the wet
grass and it proves to be a semitransparent bottle of iridescent
beauty the sight of which draws groans of luxurious sensibility from the
digger Further and further search brings out a piece of a weapon It
is strange indeed that by merely peeling off a wrapper of modern
accumulations we have lowered ourselves into an ancient world Finally a
skeleton is uncovered fairly perfect He lays it out on the grass bone
to its bone

My friend says the man must have fallen fighting here as this is no
place of burial He turns again to the trench scrapes feels till from
a corner he draws out a heavy lumpa small image four or five inches
high We clean it as before It is a statuette apparently of gold or
more probably of bronzegilta figure of Mercury obviously its head
being surmounted with the petasus or winged hat the usual accessory of
that deity Further inspection reveals the workmanship to be of good
finish and detail and preserved by the limy earth to be as fresh in
every line as on the day it left the hands of its artificer

We seem to be standing in the Roman Forum and not on a hill in Wessex
Intent upon this truly valuable relic of the old empire of which even
this remote spot was a component part we do not notice what is going on
in the present world till reminded of it by the sudden renewal of the
storm Looking up I perceive that the wide extinguisher of cloud has
again settled down upon the fortresstown as if resting upon the edge of
the inner rampart and shutting out the moon I turn my back to the
tempest still directing the light across the hole My companion digs on
unconcernedly he is living two thousand years ago and despises things
of the moment as dreams But at last he is fairly beaten and standing
up beside me looks round on what he has done The rays of the lantern
pass over the trench to the tall skeleton stretched upon the grass on the
other side The beating rain has washed the bones clean and smooth and
the forehead cheekbones and twoandthirty teeth of the skull glisten
in the candleshine as they lie

This storm like the first is of the nature of a squall and it ends as
abruptly as the other We dig no further My friend says that it is
enoughhe has proved his point He turns to replace the bones in the
trench and covers them But they fall to pieces under his touch the air
has disintegrated them and he can only sweep in the fragments The next
act of his plan is more than difficult but is carried out The
treasures are inhumed again in their respective holes they are not ours
Each deposition seems to cost him a twinge and at one moment I fancied I
saw him slip his hand into his coat pocket

We must rebury them all say I

O yes he answers with integrity I was wiping my hand

The beauties of the tesselated floor of the governors house are once
again consigned to darkness the trench is filled up the sod laid
smoothly down he wipes the perspiration from his forehead with the same
handkerchief he had used to mop the skeleton and tesserae clean and we
make for the eastern gate of the fortress

Dawn bursts upon us suddenly as we reach the opening It comes by the
lifting and thinning of the clouds that way till we are bathed in a pink
light The direction of his homeward journey is not the same as mine
and we part under the outer slope

Walking along quickly to restore warmth I muse upon my eccentric friend
and cannot help asking myself this question Did he really replace the
gilded image of the god Mercurius with the rest of the treasures He
seemed to do so and yet I could not testify to the fact Probably
however he was as good as his word

  

It was thus I spoke to myself and so the adventure ended But one thing
remains to be told and that is concerned with seven years after Among
the effects of my friend at that time just deceased was found
carefully preserved a gilt statuette representing Mercury labelled
Debased Roman No record was attached to explain how it came into his
possession The figure was bequeathed to the Casterbridge Museum

WHAT THE SHEPHERD SAW A TALE OF FOUR MOONLIGHT NIGHTS


The genial Justice of the Peacenow alas no morewho made himself
responsible for the facts of this story used to begin in the good old
fashioned way with a bright moonlight night and a mysterious figure an
excellent stroke for an opening even to this day if well followed up

The Christmas moon he would say was showing her cold face to the
upland the upland reflecting the radiance in frostsparkles so minute as
only to be discernible by an eye near at hand This eye he said was
the eye of a shepherd lad young for his occupation who stood within a
wheeled hut of the kind commonly in use among sheepkeepers during the
early lambing season and was abstractedly looking through the loophole
at the scene without

The spot was called Lambing Corner and it was a sheltered portion of
that wide expanse of rough pastureland known as the Marlbury Downs which
you directly traverse when following the turnpikeroad across MidWessex
from London through Aldbrickham in the direction of Bath and Bristol
Here where the hut stood the land was high and dry open except to the
north and commanding an undulating view for miles On the north side
grew a tall belt of coarse furze with enormous stalks a clump of the
same standing detached in front of the general mass The clump was
hollow and the interior had been ingeniously taken advantage of as a
position for the beforementioned hut which was thus completely screened
from winds and almost invisible except through the narrow approach But
the furze twigs had been cut away from the two little windows of the hut
that the occupier might keep his eye on his sheep

In the rear the shelter afforded by the belt of furze bushes was
artificially improved by an inclosure of upright stakes interwoven with
boughs of the same prickly vegetation and within the inclosure lay a
renowned MarlburyDown breeding flock of eight hundred ewes

To the south in the direction of the young shepherds idle gaze there
rose one conspicuous object above the uniform moonlit plateau and only
one It was a Druidical trilithon consisting of three oblong stones in
the form of a doorway two on end and one across as a lintel Each
stone had been worn scratched washed nibbled split and otherwise
attacked by ten thousand different weathers but now the blocks looked
shapely and little the worse for wear so beautifully were they silvered
over by the light of the moon The ruin was locally called the Devils
Door

An old shepherd presently entered the hut from the direction of the ewes
and looked around in the gloom Be ye sleepy he asked in cross
accents of the boy

The lad replied rather timidly in the negative

Then said the shepherd Ill get me homealong and rest for a few
hours Theres nothing to be done here now as I can see The ewes can
want no more tending till daybreaktis beyond the bounds of reason that
they can But as the order is that one of us must bide Ill leave ee
dye hear You can sleep by day and I cant And you can be down to my
house in ten minutes if anything should happen I cant afford ee
candle but as tis Christmas week and the time that folks have
hollerdays you can enjoy yerself by falling asleep a bit in the chair
instead of biding awake all the time But mind not longer at once than
while the shade of the Devils Door moves a couple of spans for you must
keep an eye upon the ewes

The boy made no definite reply and the old man stirring the fire in the
stove with his crookstem closed the door upon his companion and
vanished

As this had been more or less the course of events every night since the
seasons lambing had set in the boy was not at all surprised at the
charge and amused himself for some time by lighting straws at the stove
He then went out to the ewes and newborn lambs reentered sat down
and finally fell asleep This was his customary manner of performing his
watch for though special permission for naps had this week been
accorded he had as a matter of fact done the same thing on every
preceding night sleeping often till awakened by a smack on the shoulder
at three or four in the morning from the crookstem of the old man

It might have been about eleven oclock when he awoke He was so
surprised at awaking without apparently being called or struck that on
second thoughts he assumed that somebody must have called him in spite of
appearances and looked out of the hut window towards the sheep They
all lay as quiet as when he had visited them very little bleating being
audible and no human soul disturbing the scene He next looked from the
opposite window and here the case was different The frostfacets
glistened under the moon as before an occasional furze bush showed as a
dark spot on the same and in the foreground stood the ghostly form of
the trilithon But in front of the trilithon stood a man

That he was not the shepherd or any one of the farm labourers was
apparent in a moments observationhis dress being a dark suit and his
figure of slender build and graceful carriage He walked backwards and
forwards in front of the trilithon

The shepherd lad had hardly done speculating on the strangeness of the
unknowns presence here at such an hour when he saw a second figure
crossing the open sward towards the locality of the trilithon and furze
clump that screened the hut This second personage was a woman and
immediately on sight of her the male stranger hastened forward meeting
her just in front of the hut window Before she seemed to be aware of
his intention he clasped her in his arms

The lady released herself and drew back with some dignity

You have come Harrietbless you for it he exclaimed fervently

But not for this she answered in offended accents And then more
goodnaturedly I have come Fred because you entreated me so What
can have been the object of your writing such a letter I feared I might
be doing you grievous ill by staying away How did you come here

I walked all the way from my fathers

Well what is it How have you lived since we last met

But roughly you might have known that without asking I have seen many
lands and many faces since I last walked these downs but I have only
thought of you

Is it only to tell me this that you have summoned me so strangely

A passing breeze blew away the murmur of the reply and several succeeding
sentences till the mans voice again became audible in the words
Harriettruth between us two I have heard that the Duke does not
treat you too well

He is warmtempered but he is a good husband

He speaks roughly to you and sometimes even threatens to lock you out
of doors

Only once Fred On my honour only once The Duke is a fairly good
husband I repeat But you deserve punishment for this nights trick of
drawing me out What does it mean

Harriet dearest is this fair or honest Is it not notorious that your
life with him is a sad onethat in spite of the sweetness of your
temper the sourness of his embitters your days I have come to know if
I can help you You are a Duchess and I am Fred Ogbourne but it is not
impossible that I may be able to help you    By God the sweetness of
that tongue ought to keep him civil especially when there is added to it
the sweetness of that face

Captain Ogbourne she exclaimed with an emphasis of playful fear How
can such a comrade of my youth behave to me as you do Dont speak so
and stare at me so Is this really all you have to say I see I ought
not to have come Twas thoughtlessly done

Another breeze broke the thread of discourse for a time

Very well I perceive you are dead and lost to me he could next be
heard to say Captain Ogbourne proves that As I once loved you I
love you now Harriet without one jot of abatement but you are not the
woman you wereyou once were honest towards me and now you conceal your
heart in madeup speeches Let it be I can never see you again

You need not say that in such a tragedy tone you silly You may see me
in an ordinary waywhy should you not But of course not in such a
way as this I should not have come now if it had not happened that the
Duke is away from home so that there is nobody to check my erratic
impulses

When does he return

The day after tomorrow or the day after that

Then meet me again tomorrow night

No Fred I cannot

If you cannot tomorrow night you can the night after one of the two
before he comes please bestow on me Now your hand upon it Tomorrow
or next night you will see me to bid me farewell He seized the
Duchesss hand

No but Fredlet go my hand What do you mean by holding me so If it
be love to forget all respect to a womans present position in thinking
of her past then yours may be so Frederick It is not kind and gentle
of you to induce me to come to this place for pity of you and then to
hold me tight here

But see me once more I have come two thousand miles to ask it

O I must not There will be slandersHeaven knows what I cannot
meet you For the sake of old times dont ask it

Then own two things to me that you did love me once and that your
husband is unkind to you often enough now to make you think of the time
when you cared for me

YesI own them both she answered faintly But owning such as that
tells against me and I swear the inference is not true

Dont say that for you have comelet me think the reason of your
coming what I like to think it It can do you no harm Come once more

He still held her hand and waist Very well then she said Thus
far you shall persuade me I will meet you tomorrow night or the night
after Now let me go

He released her and they parted The Duchess ran rapidly down the hill
towards the outlying mansion of Shakeforest Towers and when he had
watched her out of sight he turned and strode off in the opposite
direction All then was silent and empty as before

Yet it was only for a moment When they had quite departed another
shape appeared upon the scene He came from behind the trilithon He
was a man of stouter build than the first and wore the boots and spurs
of a horseman Two things were at once obvious from this phenomenon
that he had watched the interview between the Captain and the Duchess
and that though he probably had seen every movement of the couple
including the embrace he had been too remote to hear the reluctant words
of the ladys conversationor indeed any words at allso that the
meeting must have exhibited itself to his eye as the assignation of a
pair of wellagreed lovers But it was necessary that several years
should elapse before the shepherdboy was old enough to reason out this

The third individual stood still for a moment as if deep in meditation
He crossed over to where the lady and gentleman had stood and looked at
the ground then he too turned and went away in a third direction as
widely divergent as possible from those taken by the two interlocutors
His course was towards the highway and a few minutes afterwards the trot
of a horse might have been heard upon its frosty surface lessening till
it died away upon the ear

The boy remained in the hut confronting the trilithon as if he expected
yet more actors on the scene but nobody else appeared How long he
stood with his little face against the loophole he hardly knew but he
was rudely awakened from his reverie by a punch in his back and in the
feel of it he familiarly recognized the stem of the old shepherds crook

Blame thy young eyes and limbs Bill Millsnow you have let the fire
out and you know I want it kept in I thought something would go wrong
with ee up here and I couldnt bide in bed no more than thistledown on
the wind that I could not Well whats happened fie upon ee

Nothing

Ewes all as I left em

Yes

Any lambs want bringing in

No

The shepherd relit the fire and went out among the sheep with a lantern
for the moon was getting low Soon he came in again

Blame it allthoust say that nothing have happened when one ewe have
twinned and is like to go off and another is dying for want of half an
eye of looking to I told ee Bill Mills if anything went wrong to
come down and call me and this is how you have done it

You said I could go to sleep for a hollerday and I did

Dont you speak to your betters like that young man or youll come to
the gallowstree You didnt sleep all the time or you wouldnt have
been peeping out of that there hole Now you can go home and be up here
again by breakfasttime I be an old man and theres old men that
deserve well of the world but no Imust rest how I can

The elder shepherd then lay down inside the hut and the boy went down
the hill to the hamlet where he dwelt



SECOND NIGHT


When the next night drew on the actions of the boy were almost enough to
show that he was thinking of the meeting he had witnessed and of the
promise wrung from the lady that she would come there again As far as
the sheeptending arrangements were concerned tonight was but a
repetition of the foregoing one Between ten and eleven oclock the old
shepherd withdrew as usual for what sleep at home he might chance to get
without interruption making up the other necessary hours of rest at some
time during the day the boy was left alone

The frost was the same as on the night before except perhaps that it was
a little more severe The moon shone as usual except that it was three
quarters of an hour later in its course and the boys condition was much
the same except that he felt no sleepiness whatever He felt too
rather afraid but upon the whole he preferred witnessing an assignation
of strangers to running the risk of being discovered absent by the old
shepherd

It was before the distant clock of Shakeforest Towers had struck eleven
that he observed the opening of the second act of this midnight drama It
consisted in the appearance of neither lover nor Duchess but of the
third figurethe stout man booted and spurredwho came up from the
easterly direction in which he had retreated the night before He walked
once round the trilithon and next advanced towards the clump concealing
the hut the moonlight shining full upon his face and revealing him to be
the Duke Fear seized upon the shepherdboy the Duke was Jove himself
to the rural population whom to offend was starvation homelessness and
death and whom to look at was to be mentally scathed and dumbfoundered
He closed the stove so that not a spark of light appeared and hastily
buried himself in the straw that lay in a corner

The Duke came close to the clump of furze and stood by the spot where his
wife and the Captain had held their dialogue he examined the furze as if
searching for a hidingplace and in doing so discovered the hut The
latter he walked round and then looked inside finding it to all seeming
empty he entered closing the door behind him and taking his place at
the little circular window against which the boys face had been pressed
just before

The Duke had not adopted his measures too rapidly if his object were
concealment Almost as soon as he had stationed himself there eleven
oclock struck and the slender young man who had previously graced the
scene promptly reappeared from the north quarter of the down The spot
of assignation having by the accident of his running forward on the
foregoing night removed itself from the Devils Door to the clump of
furze he instinctively came thither and waited for the Duchess where he
had met her before

But a fearful surprise was in store for him tonight as well as for the
trembling juvenile At his appearance the Duke breathed more and more
quickly his breathings being distinctly audible to the crouching boy
The young man had hardly paused when the alert nobleman softly opened the
door of the hut and stepping round the furze came full upon Captain
Fred

You have dishonoured her and you shall die the death you deserve came
to the shepherds ears in a harsh hollow whisper through the boarding
of the hut

The apathetic and taciturn boy was excited enough to run the risk of
rising and looking from the window but he could see nothing for the
intervening furze boughs both the men having gone round to the side
What took place in the few following moments he never exactly knew He
discerned portion of a shadow in quick muscular movement then there was
the fall of something on the grass then there was stillness

Two or three minutes later the Duke became visible round the corner of
the hut dragging by the collar the now inert body of the second man The
Duke dragged him across the open space towards the trilithon Behind
this ruin was a hollow irregular spot overgrown with furze and stunted
thorns and riddled by the old holes of badgers its former inhabitants
who had now died out or departed The Duke vanished into this depression
with his burden reappearing after the lapse of a few seconds When he
came forth he dragged nothing behind him

He returned to the side of the hut cleansed something on the grass and
again put himself on the watch though not as before inside the hut but
without on the shady side Now for the second he said

It was plain even to the unsophisticated boy that he now awaited the
other person of the appointmenthis wife the Duchessfor what purpose
it was terrible to think He seemed to be a man of such determined
temper that he would scarcely hesitate in carrying out a course of
revenge to the bitter end Moreoverthough it was what the shepherd did
not perceivethis was all the more probable in that the moody Duke was
labouring under the exaggerated impression which the sight of the meeting
in dumb show had conveyed

The jealous watcher waited long but he waited in vain From within the
hut the boy could hear his occasional exclamations of surprise as if he
were almost disappointed at the failure of his assumption that his guilty
Duchess would surely keep the tryst Sometimes he stepped from the shade
of the furze into the moonlight and held up his watch to learn the time

About halfpast eleven he seemed to give up expecting her He then went
a second time to the hollow behind the trilithon remaining there nearly
a quarter of an hour From this place he proceeded quickly over a
shoulder of the declivity a little to the left presently returning on
horseback which proved that his horse had been tethered in some secret
place down there Crossing anew the down between the hut and the
trilithon and scanning the precincts as if finally to assure himself
that she had not come he rode slowly downwards in the direction of
Shakeforest Towers

The juvenile shepherd thought of what lay in the hollow yonder and no
fear of the crookstem of his superior officer was potent enough to
detain him longer on that hill alone Any live company even the most
terrible was better than the company of the dead so running with the
speed of a hare in the direction pursued by the horseman he overtook the
revengeful Duke at the second descent where the great western road
crossed before you came to the old park entrance on that sidenow closed
up and the lodge cleared away though at the time it was wondered why
being considered the most convenient gate of all

Once within the sound of the horses footsteps Bill Mills felt
comparatively comfortable for though in awe of the Duke because of his
position he had no moral repugnance to his companionship on account of
the grisly deed he had committed considering that powerful nobleman to
have a right to do what he chose on his own lands The Duke rode
steadily on beneath his ancestral trees the hoofs of his horse sending
up a smart sound now that he had reached the hard road of the drive and
soon drew near the front door of his house surmounted by parapets with
squarecut battlements that cast a notched shade upon the gravelled
terrace These outlines were quite familiar to little Bill Mills though
nothing within their boundary had ever been seen by him

When the rider approached the mansion a small turret door was quickly
opened and a woman came out As soon as she saw the horsemans outlines
she ran forward into the moonlight to meet him

Ah dearand are you come she said I heard Heros tread just when
you rode over the hill and I knew it in a moment I would have come
further if I had been aware

Glad to see me eh

How can you ask that

Well it is a lovely night for meetings

Yes it is a lovely night

The Duke dismounted and stood by her side Why should you have been
listening at this time of night and yet not expecting me he asked

Why indeed There is a strange story attached to that which I must
tell you at once But why did you come a night sooner than you said you
would come I am rather sorryI really am shaking her head
playfully for as a surprise to you I had ordered a bonfire to be built
which was to be lighted on your arrival tomorrow and now it is wasted
You can see the outline of it just out there

The Duke looked across to a spot of rising glade and saw the faggots in
a heap He then bent his eyes with a bland and puzzled air on the
ground What is this strange story you have to tell me that kept you
awake he murmured

It is thisand it is really rather serious My cousin Fred
OgbourneCaptain Ogbourne as he is nowwas in his boyhood a great
admirer of mine as I think I have told you though I was six years his
senior In strict truth he was absurdly fond of me

You have never told me of that before

Then it was your sister I toldyes it was Well you know I have not
seen him for many years and naturally I had quite forgotten his
admiration of me in old times But guess my surprise when the day before
yesterday I received a mysterious note bearing no address and found on
opening it that it came from him The contents frightened me out of my
wits He had returned from Canada to his fathers house and conjured me
by all he could think of to meet him at once But I think I can repeat
the exact words though I will show it to you when we get indoors

 MY DEAR COUSIN HARRIET the note said After this long absence you
 will be surprised at my sudden reappearance and more by what I am
 going to ask But if my life and future are of any concern to you at
 all I beg that you will grant my request What I require of you is
 dear Harriet that you meet me about eleven tonight by the Druid
 stones on Marlbury Downs about a mile or more from your house I
 cannot say more except to entreat you to come I will explain all
 when you are there The one thing is I want to see you Come alone
 Believe me I would not ask this if my happiness did not hang upon
 itGod knows how entirely I am too agitated to say moreYours
 FRED

That was all of it Now of course I ought have gone as it turned out
but that I did not think of then I remembered his impetuous temper and
feared that something grievous was impending over his head while he had
not a friend in the world to help him or any one except myself to whom
he would care to make his trouble known So I wrapped myself up and went
to Marlbury Downs at the time he had named Dont you think I was
courageous

Very

When I got therebut shall we not walk on it is getting cold The
Duke however did not move When I got there he came of course as a
full grown man and officer and not as the lad that I had known him When
I saw him I was sorry I had come I can hardly tell you how he behaved
What he wanted I dont know even now it seemed to be no more than the
mere meeting with me He held me by the hand and waistO so tightand
would not let me go till I had promised to meet him again His manner
was so strange and passionate that I was afraid of him in such a lonely
place and I promised to come Then I escapedthen I ran homeand
thats all When the time drew on this evening for the
appointmentwhich of course I never intended to keep I felt uneasy
lest when he found I meant to disappoint him he would come on to the
house and thats why I could not sleep But you are so silent

I have had a long journey

Then let us get into the house Why did you come alone and unattended
like this

It was my humour

After a moments silence during which they moved on she said I have
thought of something which I hardly like to suggest to you He said that
if I failed to come tonight he would wait again tomorrow night Now
shall we tomorrow night go to the hill togetherjust to see if he is
there and if he is read him a lesson on his foolishness in nourishing
this old passion and sending for me so oddly instead of coming to the
house

Why should we see if hes there said her husband moodily

Because I think we ought to do something in it Poor Fred He would
listen to you if you reasoned with him and set our positions in their
true light before him It would be no more than Christian kindness to a
man who unquestionably is very miserable from some cause or other His
head seems quite turned

By this time they had reached the door rung the bell and waited All
the house seemed to be asleep but soon a man came to them the horse was
taken away and the Duke and Duchess went in



THIRD NIGHT


There was no help for it Bill Mills was obliged to stay on duty in the
old shepherds absence this evening as before or give up his post and
living He thought as bravely as he could of what lay behind the Devils
Door but with no great success and was therefore in a measure relieved
even if awestricken when he saw the forms of the Duke and Duchess
strolling across the frosted greensward The Duchess was a few yards in
front of her husband and tripped on lightly

I tell you he has not thought it worth while to come again the Duke
insisted as he stood still reluctant to walk further

He is more likely to come and wait all night and it would be harsh
treatment to let him do it a second time

He is not here so turn and come home

He seems not to be here certainly I wonder if anything has happened to
him If it has I shall never forgive myself

The Duke uneasily O no He has some other engagement

That is very unlikely

Or perhaps he has found the distance too far

Nor is that probable

Then he may have thought better of it

Yes he may have thought better of it if indeed he is not here all
the timesomewhere in the hollow behind the Devils Door Let us go and
see it will serve him right to surprise him

O hes not there

He may be lying very quiet because of you she said archly

O nonot because of me

Come then I declare dearest you lag like an unwilling schoolboy to
night and theres no responsiveness in you You are jealous of that
poor lad and it is quite absurd of you

Ill come Ill come Say no more Harriet And they crossed over
the green

Wondering what they would do the young shepherd left the hut and
doubled behind the belt of furze intending to stand near the trilithon
unperceived But in crossing the few yards of open ground he was for a
moment exposed to view

Ah I see him at last said the Duchess

See him said the Duke Where

By the Devils Door dont you notice a figure there Ah my poor lover
cousin wont you catch it now And she laughed halfpityingly But
whats the matter she asked turning to her husband

It is not he said the Duke hoarsely It cant be he

No it is not he It is too small for him It is a boy

Ah I thought so Boy come here

The youthful shepherd advanced with apprehension

What are you doing here

Keeping sheep your Grace

Ah you know me Do you keep sheep here every night

Off and on my Lord Duke

And what have you seen here tonight or last night inquired the
Duchess Any person waiting or walking about

The boy was silent

He has seen nothing interrupted her husband his eyes so forbiddingly
fixed on the boy that they seemed to shine like points of fire Come
let us go The air is too keen to stand in long

When they were gone the boy retreated to the hut and sheep less fearful
now than at firstfamiliarity with the situation having gradually
overpowered his thoughts of the buried man But he was not to be left
alone long When an interval had elapsed of about sufficient length for
walking to and from Shakeforest Towers there appeared from that
direction the heavy form of the Duke He now came alone

The nobleman on his part seemed to have eyes no less sharp than the
boys for he instantly recognized the latter among the ewes and came
straight towards him

Are you the shepherd lad I spoke to a short time ago

I be my Lord Duke

Now listen to me Her Grace asked you what you had seen this last night
or two up here and you made no reply I now ask the same thing and you
need not be afraid to answer Have you seen anything strange these
nights you have been watching here

My Lord Duke I be a poor heedless boy and what I see I dont bear in
mind

I ask you again said the Duke coming nearer have you seen anything
strange these nights you have been watching here

O my Lord Duke I be but the undershepherd boy and my father he was
but your humble Graces hedger and my mother only the cinderwoman in
the backyard I fall asleep when left alone and I see nothing at all

The Duke grasped the boy by the shoulder and directly impending over
him stared down into his face Did you see anything strange done here
last night I say

O my Lord Duke have mercy and dont stab me cried the shepherd
falling on his knees I have never seen you walking here or riding
here or lyinginwait for a man or dragging a heavy load

Hm said his interrogator grimly relaxing his hold It is well to
know that you have never seen those things Now which would you
rathersee me do those things now or keep a secret all your life

Keep a secret my Lord Duke

Sure you are able

O your Grace try me

Very well And now how do you like sheepkeeping

Not at all Tis lonely work for them that think of spirits and Im
badly used

I believe you You are too young for it I must do something to make
you more comfortable You shall change this smockfrock for a real cloth
jacket and your thick boots for polished shoes And you shall be taught
what you have never yet heard of and be put to school and have bats and
balls for the holidays and be made a man of But you must never say you
have been a shepherd boy and watched on the hills at night for shepherd
boys are not liked in good company

Trust me my Lord Duke

The very moment you forget yourself and speak of your shepherd
daysthis year next year in school out of school or riding in your
carriage twenty years henceat that moment my help will be withdrawn
and smash down you come to shepherding forthwith You have parents I
think you say

A widowed mother only my Lord Duke

Ill provide for her and make a comfortable woman of her until you
speak ofwhat

Of my shepherd days and what I saw here

Good If you do speak of it

Smash down she comes to widowing forthwith

Thats wellvery well But its not enough Come here He took the
boy across to the trilithon and made him kneel down

Now this was once a holy place resumed the Duke An altar stood
here erected to a venerable family of gods who were known and talked of
long before the God we know now So that an oath sworn here is doubly an
oath Say this after me May all the host aboveangels and archangels
and principalities and powerspunish me may I be tormented wherever I
amin the house or in the garden in the fields or in the roads in
church or in chapel at home or abroad on land or at sea may I be
afflicted in eating and in drinking in growing up and in growing old in
living and dying inwardly and outwardly and for always if I ever speak
of my life as a shepherd boy or of what I have seen done on this
Marlbury Down So be it and so let it be Amen and amen Now kiss
the stone

The trembling boy repeated the words and kissed the stone as desired

The Duke led him off by the hand That night the junior shepherd slept
in Shakeforest Towers and the next day he was sent away for tuition to a
remote village Thence he went to a preparatory establishment and in
due course to a public school



FOURTH NIGHT


On a winter evening many years subsequent to the abovementioned
occurrences the cidevant shepherd sat in a wellfurnished office in the
north wing of Shakeforest Towers in the guise of an ordinary educated man
of business He appeared at this time as a person of thirtyeight or
forty though actually he was several years younger A worn and restless
glance of the eye now and then when he lifted his head to search for
some letter or paper which had been mislaid seemed to denote that his
was not a mind so thoroughly at ease as his surroundings might have led
an observer to expect

His pallor too was remarkable for a countryman He was professedly
engaged in writing but he shaped not word He had sat there only a few
minutes when laying down his pen and pushing back his chair he rested
a hand uneasily on each of the chairarms and looked on the floor

Soon he arose and left the room His course was along a passage which
ended in a central octagonal hall crossing this he knocked at a door A
faint though deep voice told him to come in The room he entered was
the library and it was tenanted by a single person onlyhis patron the
Duke

During this long interval of years the Duke had lost all his heaviness of
build He was indeed almost a skeleton his white hair was thin and
his hands were nearly transparent OhMills he murmured Sit down
What is it

Nothing new your Grace Nobody to speak of has written and nobody has
called

Ahwhat then You look concerned

Old times have come to life owing to something waking them

Old times be cursedwhich old times are they

That Christmas week twentytwo years ago when the late Duchesss cousin
Frederick implored her to meet him on Marlbury Downs I saw the
meetingit was just such a night as thisand I as you know saw more
She met him once but not the second time

Mills shall I recall some words to youthe words of an oath taken on
that hill by a shepherdboy

It is unnecessary He has strenuously kept that oath and promise Since
that night no sound of his shepherd life has crossed his lipseven to
yourself But do you wish to hear more or do you not your Grace

I wish to hear no more said the Duke sullenly

Very well let it be so But a time seems comingmay be quite near at
handwhen in spite of my lips that episode will allow itself to go
undivulged no longer

I wish to hear no more repeated the Duke

You need be under no fear of treachery from me said the steward
somewhat bitterly I am a man to whom you have been kindno patron
could have been kinder You have clothed and educated me have installed
me here and I am not unmindful But what of ithas your Grace gained
much by my stanchness I think not There was great excitement about
Captain Ogbournes disappearance but I spoke not a word And his body
has never been found For twentytwo years I have wondered what you did
with him Now I know A circumstance that occurred this afternoon
recalled the time to me most forcibly To make it certain to myself that
all was not a dream I went up there with a spade I searched and saw
enough to know that something decays there in a closed badgers hole

Mills do you think the Duchess guessed

She never did I am sure to the day of her death

Did you leave all as you found it on the hill

I did

What made you think of going up there this particular afternoon

What your Grace says you dont wish to be told

The Duke was silent and the stillness of the evening was so marked that
there reached their ears from the outer air the sound of a tolling bell

What is that bell tolling for asked the nobleman

For what I came to tell you of your Grace

You torment me it is your way said the Duke querulously Whos dead
in the village

The oldest manthe old shepherd

Dead at lasthow old is he

Ninetyfour

And I am only seventy I have fourandtwenty years to the good

I served under that old man when I kept sheep on Marlbury Downs And he
was on the hill that second night when I first exchanged words with your
Grace He was on the hill all the time but I did not know he was
therenor did you

Ah said the Duke starting up Go onI yield the pointyou may
tell

I heard this afternoon that he was at the point of death It was that
which set me thinking of that past timeand induced me to search on the
hill for what I have told you Coming back I heard that he wished to see
the Vicar to confess to him a secret he had kept for more than twenty
yearsout of respect to my Lord the Dukesomething that he had seen
committed on Marlbury Downs when returning to the flock on a December
night twentytwo years ago I have thought it over He had left me in
charge that evening but he was in the habit of coming back suddenly
lest I should have fallen asleep That night I saw nothing of him
though he had promised to return He must have returned andfound
reason to keep in hiding It is all plain The next thing is that the
Vicar went to him two hours ago Further than that I have not heard

It is quite enough I will see the Vicar at daybreak tomorrow

What to do

Stop his tongue for fourandtwenty yearstill I am dead at
ninetyfour like the shepherd

Your Gracewhile you impose silence on me I will not speak even
though nay neck should pay the penalty I promised to be yours and I am
yours But is this persistence of any avail

Ill stop his tongue I say cried the Duke with some of his old rugged
force Now you go home to bed Mills and leave me to manage him

The interview ended and the steward withdrew The night as he had
said was just such an one as the night of twentytwo years before and
the events of the evening destroyed in him all regard for the season as
one of cheerfulness and goodwill He went off to his own house on the
further verge of the park where he led a lonely life scarcely calling
any man friend At eleven he prepared to retire to bedbut did not
retire He sat down and reflected Twelve oclock struck he looked out
at the colourless moon and prompted by he knew not what put on his hat
and emerged into the air Here William Mills strolled on and on till he
reached the top of Marlbury Downs a spot he had not visited at this hour
of the night during the whole scoreandodd years

He placed himself as nearly as he could guess on the spot where the
shepherds hut had stood No lambing was in progress there now and the
old shepherd who had used him so roughly had ceased from his labours that
very day But the trilithon stood up white as ever and crossing the
intervening sward the steward fancifully placed his mouth against the
stone Restless and selfreproachful as he was he could not resist a
smile as he thought of the terrifying oath of compact sealed by a kiss
upon the stones of a Pagan temple But he had kept his word rather as a
promise than as a formal vow with much worldly advantage to himself
though not much happiness till increase of years had bred reactionary
feelings which led him to receive the news of tonight with emotions akin
to relief

While leaning against the Devils Door and thinking on these things he
became conscious that he was not the only inhabitant of the down A
figure in white was moving across his front with long noiseless strides
Mills stood motionless and when the form drew quite near he perceived it
to be that of the Duke himself in his nightshirtapparently walking in
his sleep Not to alarm the old man Mills clung close to the shadow of
the stone The Duke went straight on into the hollow There he knelt
down and began scratching the earth with his hands like a badger After
a few minutes he arose sighed heavily and retraced his steps as he had
come

Fearing that he might harm himself yet unwilling to arouse him the
steward followed noiselessly The Duke kept on his path unerringly
entered the park and made for the house where he let himself in by a
window that stood openthe one probably by which he had come out Mills
softly closed the window behind his patron and then retired homeward to
await the revelations of the morning deeming it unnecessary to alarm the
house

However he felt uneasy during the remainder of the night no less on
account of the Dukes personal condition than because of that which was
imminent next day Early in the morning he called at Shakeforest Towers
The blinds were down and there was something singular upon the porters
face when he opened the door The steward inquired for the Duke

The mans voice was subdued as he replied Sir I am sorry to say that
his Grace is dead He left his room some time in the night and wandered
about nobody knows where On returning to the upper floor he lost his
balance and fell downstairs

The steward told the tale of the Down before the Vicar had spoken Mills
had always intended to do so after the death of the Duke The
consequences to himself he underwent cheerfully but his life was not
prolonged He died a farmer at the Cape when still somewhat under
fortynine years of age

The splendid Marlbury breeding flock is as renowned as ever and to the
eye seems the same in every particular that it was in earlier times but
the animals which composed it on the occasion of the events gathered from
the Justice are divided by many ovine generations from its members now
Lambing Corner has long since ceased to be used for lambing purposes
though the name still lingers on as the appellation of the spot This
abandonment of site may be partly owing to the removal of the high furze
bushes which lent such convenient shelter at that date Partly too it
may be due to another circumstance For it is said by present shepherds
in that district that during the nights of Christmas week flitting shapes
are seen in the open space around the trilithon together with the gleam
of a weapon and the shadow of a man dragging a burden into the hollow
But of these things there is no certain testimony

Christmas 1881




A COMMITTEEMAN OF THE TERROR


We had been talking of the Georgian glories of our oldfashioned watering
place which now with its substantial russetred and dun brick buildings
in the style of the year eighteen hundred looks like one side of a Soho
or Bloomsbury Street transported to the shore and draws a smile from the
modern tourist who has no eye for solidity of build The writer quite a
youth was present merely as a listener The conversation proceeded from
general subjects to particular until old Mrs H whose memory was as
perfect at eighty as it had ever been in her life interested us all by
the obvious fidelity with which she repeated a story many times related
to her by her mother when our aged friend was a girla domestic drama
much affecting the life of an acquaintance of her said parent one
Mademoiselle V a teacher of French The incidents occurred in the
town during the heyday of its fortunes at the time of our brief peace
with France in 18023

I wrote it down in the shape of a story some years ago just after my
mothers death said Mrs H It is locked up in my desk there now

Read it said we

No said she the light is bad and I can remember it well enough
word for word flourishes and all We could not be choosers in the
circumstances and she began

    

There are two in it of course the man and the woman and it was on an
evening in September that she first got to know him There had not been
such a grand gathering on the Esplanade all the season His Majesty King
George the Third was present with all the princesses and royal dukes
while upwards of three hundred of the general nobility and other persons
of distinction were also in the town at the time Carriages and other
conveyances were arriving every minute from London and elsewhere and
when among the rest a shabby stagecoach came in by a byroute along the
coast from Havenpool and drew up at a secondrate tavern it attracted
comparatively little notice

From this dusty vehicle a man alighted left his small quantity of
luggage temporarily at the office and walked along the street as if to
look for lodgings

He was about fortyfivepossibly fiftyand wore a long coat of faded
superfine cloth with a heavy collar and a hunchedup neckcloth He
seemed to desire obscurity

But the display appeared presently to strike him and he asked of a
rustic he met in the street what was going on his accent being that of
one to whom English pronunciation was difficult

The countryman looked at him with a slight surprise and said King
Jarge is here and his royal Cwort

The stranger inquired if they were going to stay long

Dont know Sir Same as they always do I suppose

How long is that

Till some time in October Theyve come here every summer since eighty
nine

The stranger moved onward down St Thomas Street and approached the
bridge over the harbour backwater that then as now connected the old
town with the more modern portion The spot was swept with the rays of a
low sun which lit up the harbour lengthwise and shone under the brim of
the mans hat and into his eyes as he looked westward Against the
radiance figures were crossing in the opposite direction to his own
among them this lady of my mothers later acquaintance Mademoiselle V
She was the daughter of a good old French family and at that date a pale
woman twentyeight or thirty years of age tall and elegant in figure
but plainly dressed and wearing that evening she said a small muslin
shawl crossed over the bosom in the fashion of the time and tied behind

At sight of his face which as she used to tell us was unusually
distinct in the peering sunlight she could not help giving a little
shriek of horror for a terrible reason connected with her history and
after walking a few steps further she sank down against the parapet of
the bridge in a fainting fit

In his preoccupation the foreign gentleman had hardly noticed her but
her strange collapse immediately attracted his attention He quickly
crossed the carriageway picked her up and carried her into the first
shop adjoining the bridge explaining that she was a lady who had been
taken ill outside

She soon revived but clearly much puzzled her helper perceived that
she still had a dread of him which was sufficient to hinder her complete
recovery of selfcommand She spoke in a quick and nervous way to the
shopkeeper asking him to call a coach

This the shopkeeper did Mademoiselle V and the stranger remaining in
constrained silence while he was gone The coach came up and giving the
man the address she entered it and drove away

Who is that lady said the newly arrived gentleman

Shes of your nation as I should make bold to suppose said the
shopkeeper And he told the other that she was Mademoiselle V
governess at General Newbolds in the same town

You have many foreigners here the stranger inquired

Yes though mostly Hanoverians But since the peace they are learning
French a good deal in genteel society and French instructors are rather
in demand

Yes I teach it said the visitor I am looking for a tutorship in
an academy

The information given by the burgess to the Frenchman seemed to explain
to the latter nothing of his countrywomans conductwhich indeed was
the caseand he left the shop taking his course again over the bridge
and along the south quay to the Old Rooms Inn where he engaged a
bedchamber

Thoughts of the woman who had betrayed such agitation at sight of him
lingered naturally enough with the newcomer Though as I stated not
much less than thirty years of age Mademoiselle V one of his own
nation and of highly refined and delicate appearance had kindled a
singular interest in the middleaged gentlemans breast and her large
dark eyes as they had opened and shrunk from him exhibited a pathetic
beauty to which hardly any man could have been insensible

The next day having written some letters he went out and made known at
the office of the town Guide and of the newspaper that a teacher of
French and calligraphy had arrived leaving a card at the booksellers to
the same effect He then walked on aimlessly but at length inquired the
way to General Newbolds At the door without giving his name he asked
to see Mademoiselle V and was shown into a little back parlour where
she came to him with a gaze of surprise

My God Why do you intrude here Monsieur she gasped in French as
soon as she saw his face

You were taken ill yesterday I helped you You might have been run
over if I had not picked you up It was an act of simple humanity
certainly but I thought I might come to ask if you had recovered

She had turned aside and had scarcely heard a word of his speech I
hate you infamous man she said I cannot bear your helping me Go
away

But you are a stranger to me

I know you too well

You have the advantage then Mademoiselle I am a newcomer here I
never have seen you before to my knowledge and I certainly do not could
not hate you

Are you not Monsieur B

He flinched I amin Paris he said But here I am Monsieur G

That is trivial You are the man I say you are

How did you know my real name Mademoiselle

I saw you in years gone by when you did not see me You were formerly
Member of the Committee of Public Safety under the Convention

I was

You guillotined my father my brother my uncleall my family nearly
and broke my mothers heart They had done nothing but keep silence
Their sentiments were only guessed Their headless corpses were thrown
indiscriminately into the ditch of the Mousseaux Cemetery and destroyed
with lime

He nodded

You left me without a friend and here I am now alone in a foreign
land

I am sorry for you said be Sorry for the consequence not for the
intent What I did was a matter of conscience and from a point of view
indiscernible by you I did right I profited not a farthing But I
shall not argue this You have the satisfaction of seeing me here an
exile also in poverty betrayed by comrades as friendless as yourself

It is no satisfaction to me Monsieur

Well things done cannot be altered Now the question are you quite
recovered

Not from dislike and dread of youotherwise yes

Good morning Mademoiselle

Good morning

They did not meet again till one evening at the theatre which my
mothers friend was with great difficulty induced to frequent to perfect
herself in English pronunciation the idea she entertained at that time
being to become a teacher of English in her own country later on She
found him sitting next to her and it made her pale and restless

You are still afraid of me

I am O cannot you understand

He signified the affirmative

I follow the play with difficulty he said presently

So do Inow said she

He regarded her long and she was conscious of his look and while she
kept her eyes on the stage they filled with tears Still she would not
move and the tears ran visibly down her cheek though the play was a
merry one being no other than Mr Sheridans comedy of The Rivals
with Mr S Kemble as Captain Absolute He saw her distress and that
her mind was elsewhere and abruptly rising from his seat at
candlesnuffing time he left the theatre

Though he lived in the old town and she in the new they frequently saw
each other at a distance One of these occasions was when she was on the
north side of the harbour by the ferry waiting for the boat to take her
across He was standing by Cove Row on the quay opposite Instead of
entering the boat when it arrived she stepped back from the quay but
looking to see if he remained she beheld him pointing with his finger to
the ferryboat

Enter he said in a voice loud enough to reach her

Mademoiselle V stood still

Enter he said and as she did not move he repeated the word a third
time

She had really been going to cross and now approached and stepped down
into the boat Though she did not raise her eyes she knew that he was
watching her over At the landing steps she saw from under the brim of
her hat a hand stretched down The steps were steep and slippery

No Monsieur she said Unless indeed you believe in God and
repent of your evil past

I am sorry you were made to suffer But I only believe in the god
called Reason and I do not repent I was the instrument of a national
principle Your friends were not sacrificed for any ends of mine

She thereupon withheld her hand and clambered up unassisted He went
on ascending the Lookout Hill and disappearing over the brow Her way
was in the same direction her errand being to bring home the two young
girls under her charge who had gone to the cliff for an airing When
she joined them at the top she saw his solitary figure at the further
edge standing motionless against the sea All the while that she
remained with her pupils he stood without turning as if looking at the
frigates in the roadstead but more probably in meditation unconscious
where he was In leaving the spot one of the children threw away half a
spongebiscuit that she had been eating Passing near it he stooped
picked it up carefully and put it in his pocket

Mademoiselle V came homeward asking herself Can he be starving

From that day he was invisible for so long a time that she thought he
had gone away altogether But one evening a note came to her and she
opened it trembling

 I am here ill it said and as you know alone There are one or
 two little things I want done in case my death should occurand I
 should prefer not to ask the people here if it could be avoided Have
 you enough of the gift of charity to come and carry out my wishes
 before it is too late

Now so it was that since seeing him possess himself of the broken cake
she had insensibly begun to feel something that was more than curiosity
though perhaps less than anxiety about this fellowcountryman of hers
and it was not in her nervous and sensitive heart to resist his appeal
She found his lodging to which he had removed from the Old Rooms inn for
economy to be a room over a shop halfway up the steep and narrow
street of the old town to which the fashionable visitors seldom
penetrated With some misgiving she entered the house and was admitted
to the chamber where he lay

You are too good too good he murmured And presently You need not
shut the door You will feel safer and they will not understand what we
say

Are you in want Monsieur Can I give you

No no I merely want you to do a trifling thing or two that I have
not strength enough to do myself Nobody in the town but you knows who I
really amunless you have told

I have not told    I thought you might have acted from principle in
those sad days even

You are kind to concede that much However to the present I was
able to destroy my few papers before I became so weak    But in the
drawer there you will find some pieces of linen clothingonly two or
threemarked with initials that may be recognized Will you rip them
out with a penknife

She searched as bidden found the garments cut out the stitches of the
lettering and replaced the linen as before A promise to post in the
event of his death a letter he put in her hand completed all that he
required of her

He thanked her I think you seem sorry for me he murmured And I
am surprised You are sorry

She evaded the question Do you repent and believe she asked

No

Contrary to her expectations and his own he recovered though very
slowly and her manner grew more distant thenceforward though his
influence upon her was deeper than she knew Weeks passed away and the
month of May arrived One day at this time she met him walking slowly
along the beach to the northward

You know the news he said

You mean of the rupture between France and England again

Yes and the feeling of antagonism is stronger than it was in the last
war owing to Bonapartes highhanded arrest of the innocent English who
were travelling in our country for pleasure I feel that the war will be
long and bitter and that my wish to live unknown in England will be
frustrated See here

He took from his pocket a piece of the single newspaper which circulated
in the county in those days and she read

 The magistrates acting under the Alien Act have been requested to
 direct a very scrutinizing eye to the Academies in our towns and other
 places in which French tutors are employed and to all of that
 nationality who profess to be teachers in this country Many of them
 are known to be inveterate Enemies and Traitors to the nation among
 whose people they have found a livelihood and a home

He continued I have observed since the declaration of war a marked
difference in the conduct of the rougher class of people here towards me
If a great battle were to occuras it soon will no doubtfeeling would
grow to a pitch that would make it impossible for me a disguised man of
no known occupation to stay here With you whose duties and
antecedents are known it may be less difficult but still unpleasant
Now I propose this You have probably seen how my deep sympathy with you
has quickened to a warm feeling and what I say is will you agree to
give me a title to protect you by honouring me with your hand I am
older than you it is true but as husband and wife we can leave England
together and make the whole world our country Though I would propose
Quebec in Canada as the place which offers the best promise of a home

My God You surprise me said she

But you accept my proposal

No no

And yet I think you will Mademoiselle some day

I think not

I wont distress you further now

Much thanks    I am glad to see you looking better Monsieur I mean
you are looking better

Ah yes I am improving I walk in the sun every day

And almost every day she saw himsometimes nodding stiffly only
sometimes exchanging formal civilities You are not gone yet she said
on one of these occasions

No At present I dont think of going without you

But you find it uncomfortable here

Somewhat So when will you have pity on me

She shook her head and went on her way Yet she was a little moved He
did it on principle she would murmur He had no animosity towards
them and profited nothing

She wondered how he lived It was evident that he could not be so poor
as she had thought his pretended poverty might be to escape notice She
could not tell but she knew that she was dangerously interested in him

And he still mended till his thin pale face became more full and firm
As he mended she had to meet that request of his advanced with even
stronger insistency

The arrival of the King and Court for the season as usual brought
matters to a climax for these two lonely exiles and fellow
countrypeople The Kings awkward preference for a part of the coast in
such dangerous proximity to France made it necessary that a strict
military vigilance should be exercised to guard the royal residents Half
adozen frigates were every night posted in a line across the bay and
two lines of sentinels one at the waters edge and another behind the
Esplanade occupied the whole seafront after eight every night The
wateringplace was growing an inconvenient residence even for
Mademoiselle V herself her friendship for this strange French tutor
and writingmaster who never had any pupils having been observed by many
who slightly knew her The Generals wife whose dependent she was
repeatedly warned her against the acquaintance while the Hanoverian and
other soldiers of the Foreign Legion who had discovered the nationality
of her friend were more aggressive than the English military gallants
who made it their business to notice her

In this tense state of affairs her answers became more agitated O
Heaven how can I marry you she would say

You will surely you will he answered again I dont leave without
you And I shall soon be interrogated before the magistrates if I stay
here probably imprisoned You will come

She felt her defences breaking down Contrary to all reason and sense
of family honour she was by some abnormal craving inclining to a
tenderness for him that was founded on its opposite Sometimes her warm
sentiments burnt lower than at others and then the enormity of her
conduct showed itself in more staring hues

Shortly after this he came with a resigned look on his face It is as
I expected he said I have received a hint to go In good sooth I
am no BonapartistI am no enemy to England but the presence of the King
made it impossible for a foreigner with no visible occupation and who
may be a spy to remain at large in the town The authorities are civil
but firm They are no more than reasonable Good I must go You must
come also

She did not speak But she nodded assent her eyes drooping

On her way back to the house on the Esplanade she said to herself I am
glad I am glad I could not do otherwise It is rendering good for
evil But she knew how she mocked herself in this and that the moral
principle had not operated one jot in her acceptance of him In truth
she had not realized till now the full presence of the emotion which had
unconsciously grown up in her for this lonely and severe man who in her
tradition was vengeance and irreligion personified He seemed to absorb
her whole nature and absorbing to control it

A day or two before the one fixed for the wedding there chanced to come
to her a letter from the only acquaintance of her own sex and country she
possessed in England one to whom she had sent intelligence of her
approaching marriage without mentioning with whom This friends
misfortunes had been somewhat similar to her own which fact had been one
cause of their intimacy her friends sister a nun of the Abbey of
Montmartre having perished on the scaffold at the hands of the same
Comite de Salut Public which had numbered Mademoiselle Vs affianced
among its members The writer had felt her position much again of late
since the renewal of the war she said and the letter wound up with a
fresh denunciation of the authors of their mutual bereavement and
subsequent troubles

Coming just then its contents produced upon Mademoiselle V the
effect of a pail of water upon a somnambulist What had she been doing
in betrothing herself to this man Was she not making herself a
parricide after the event At this crisis in her feelings her lover
called He beheld her trembling and in reply to his question she told
him of her scruples with impulsive candour

She had not intended to do this but his attitude of tender command
coerced her into frankness Thereupon he exhibited an agitation never
before apparent in him He said But all that is past You are the
symbol of Charity and we are pledged to let bygones be

His words soothed her for the moment but she was sadly silent and he
went away

That night she saw as she firmly believed to the end of her life a
divinely sent vision A procession of her lost relativesfather
brother uncle cousinseemed to cross her chamber between her bed and
the window and when she endeavoured to trace their features she
perceived them to be headless and that she had recognized them by their
familiar clothes only In the morning she could not shake off the
effects of this appearance on her nerves All that day she saw nothing
of her wooer he being occupied in making arrangements for their
departure It grew towards eveningthe marriage eve but in spite of
his reassuring visit her sense of family duty waxed stronger now that
she was left alone Yet she asked herself how could she alone and
unprotected go at this eleventh hour and reassert to an affianced
husband that she could not and would not marry him while admitting at the
same time that she loved him The situation dismayed her She had
relinquished her post as governess and was staying temporarily in a room
near the coachoffice where she expected him to call in the morning to
carry out the business of their union and departure

Wisely or foolishly Mademoiselle V came to a resolution that her
only safety lay in flight His contiguity influenced her too sensibly
she could not reason So packing up her few possessions and placing on
the table the small sum she owed she went out privately secured a last
available seat in the London coach and almost before she had fully
weighed her action she was rolling out of the town in the dusk of the
September evening

Having taken this startling step she began to reflect upon her reasons
He had been one of that tragic Committee the sound of whose name was a
horror to the civilized world yet he had been only one of several
members and it seemed not the most active He had marked down names
on principle had felt no personal enmity against his victims and had
enriched himself not a sou out of the office he had held Nothing could
change the past Meanwhile he loved her and her heart inclined to as
much of him as she could detach from that past Why not as he had
suggested bury memories and inaugurate a new era by this union In
other words why not indulge her tenderness since its nullification
could do no good

Thus she held selfcommunion in her seat in the coach passing through
Casterbridge and Shottsford and on to the White Hart at Melchester at
which place the whole fabric of her recent intentions crumbled down
Better be staunch having got so far let things take their course and
marry boldly the man who had so impressed her How great he was how
small was she And she had presumed to judge him Abandoning her place
in the coach with the precipitancy that had characterized her taking it
she waited till the vehicle had driven off something in the departing
shapes of the outside passengers against the starlit sky giving her a
start as she afterwards remembered Presently the down coach The
Morning Herald entered the city and she hastily obtained a place on
the top

Ill be firmIll be hisif it cost me my immortal soul she said
And with troubled breathings she journeyed back over the road she had
just traced

She reached our royal wateringplace by the time the day broke and her
first aim was to get back to the hired room in which her last few days
had been spent When the landlady appeared at the door in response to
Mademoiselle Vs nervous summons she explained her sudden departure
and return as best she could and no objection being offered to her re
engagement of the room for one day longer she ascended to the chamber and
sat down panting She was back once more and her wild tergiversations
were a secret from him whom alone they concerned

A sealed letter was on the mantelpiece Yes it is directed to you
Mademoiselle said the woman who had followed her But we were
wondering what to do with it A town messenger brought it after you had
gone last night

When the landlady had left Mademoiselle V opened the letter and
read

 MY DEAR AND HONOURED FRIENDYou have been throughout our
 acquaintance absolutely candid concerning your misgivings But I have
 been reserved concerning mine That is the difference between us You
 probably have not guessed that every qualm you have felt on the
 subject of our marriage has been paralleled in my heart to the full
 Thus it happened that your involuntary outburst of remorse yesterday
 though mechanically deprecated by me in your presence was a last item
 in my own doubts on the wisdom of our union giving them a force that
 I could no longer withstand I came home and on reflection much as
 I honour and adore you I decide to set you free

 As one whose life has been devoted and I may say sacrificed to the
 cause of Liberty I cannot allow your judgment probably a permanent
 one to be fettered beyond release by a feeling which may be transient
 only

 It would be no less than excruciating to both that I should announce
 this decision to you by word of mouth I have therefore taken the
 less painful course of writing Before you receive this I shall have
 left the town by the evening coach for London on reaching which city
 my movements will be revealed to none

 Regard me Mademoiselle as dead and accept my renewed assurances of
 respect remembrance and affection

When she had recovered from her shock of surprise and grief she
remembered that at the starting of the coach out of Melchester before
dawn the shape of a figure among the outside passengers against the
starlit sky had caused her a momentary start from its resemblance to
that of her friend Knowing nothing of each others intentions and
screened from each other by the darkness they had left the town by the
same conveyance He the greater persevered I the smaller
returned she said

Recovering from her stupor Mademoiselle V bethought herself again of
her employer Mrs Newbold whom recent events had estranged To that
lady she went with a full heart and explained everything Mrs Newbold
kept to herself her opinion of the episode and reinstalled the deserted
bride in her old position as governess to the family

A governess she remained to the end of her days After the final peace
with France she became acquainted with my mother to whom by degrees she
imparted these experiences of hers As her hair grew white and her
features pinched Mademoiselle V would wonder what nook of the world
contained her lover if he lived and if by any chance she might see him
again But when some time in the twenties death came to her at no
great age that outline against the stars of the morning remained as the
last glimpse she ever obtained of her familys foe and her once affianced
husband

1895




MASTER JOHN HORSELEIGH KNIGHT


In the earliest and mustiest volume of the Havenpool marriage registers
said the thinfaced gentleman this entry may still be read by any one
curious enough to decipher the crabbed handwriting of the date I took a
copy of it when I was last there and it runs thus he had opened his
pocketbook and now read aloud the extract afterwards handing round the
book to us wherein we saw transcribed the following

 Mastr John Horseleigh Knyght of the pysshe of Clyffton was maryd to
 Edith the wyffe late off John Stocker mchawnte of Havenpool the
 xiiij daje of December be pvylegge gevyn by our supme hedd of the
 chyrche of Ingelonde Kynge Henry the viii th 1539

Now if you turn to the long and elaborate pedigree of the ancient family
of the Horseleighs of Clyfton Horseleigh you will find no mention
whatever of this alliance notwithstanding the privilege given by the
Sovereign and head of the Church the said Sir John being therein
chronicled as marrying at a date apparently earlier than the above the
daughter and heiress of Richard Phelipson of Montislope in Nether
Wessex a lady who outlived him of which marriage there were issue two
daughters and a son who succeeded him in his estates How are we to
account for these as it would seem contemporaneous wives A strange
local tradition only can help us and this can be briefly told

One evening in the autumn of the year 1540 or 1541 a young sailor whose
Christian name was Roger but whose surname is not known landed at his
native place of Havenpool on the South Wessex coast after a voyage in
the Newfoundland trade then newly sprung into existence He returned in
the ship Primrose with a cargo of trayne oyle brought home from the New
Founde Lande to quote from the town records of the date During his
absence of two summers and a winter which made up the term of a
Newfoundland spell many unlookedfor changes had occurred within the
quiet little seaport some of which closely affected Roger the sailor At
the time of his departure his only sister Edith had become the bride of
one Stocker a respectable townsman and part owner of the brig in which
Roger had sailed and it was to the house of this couple his only
relatives that the young man directed his steps On trying the door in
Quay Street he found it locked and then observed that the windows were
boarded up Inquiring of a bystander he learnt for the first time of
the death of his brotherinlaw though that event had taken place nearly
eighteen months before

And my sister Edith asked Roger

Shes married againas they do say and hath been so these twelve
months I dont vouch for the truth ot though if she isnt she ought
to be

Rogers face grew dark He was a man with a considerable reserve of
strong passion and he asked his informant what he meant by speaking
thus

The man explained that shortly after the young womans bereavement a
stranger had come to the port He had seen her moping on the quay had
been attracted by her youth and loneliness and in an extraordinarily
brief wooing had completely fascinated herhad carried her off and as
was reported had married her Though he had come by water he was
supposed to live no very great distance off by land They were last
heard of at Oozewood in Upper Wessex at the house of one Wall a timber
merchant where he believed she still had a lodging though her
husband if he were lawfully that much was but an occasional visitor to
the place

The stranger asked Roger Did you see him What manner of man was
he

I liked him not said the other He seemed of that kind that hath
something to conceal and as he walked with her he ever and anon turned
his head and gazed behind him as if he much feared an unwelcome pursuer
But faith continued he it may have been the mans anxiety only Yet
did I not like him

Was he older than my sister Roger asked

Aymuch older from a dozen to a score of years older A man of some
position maybe playing an amorous game for the pleasure of the hour
Who knoweth but that he have a wife already Many have done the thing
hereabouts of late

Having paid a visit to the graves of his relatives the sailor next day
went along the straight road which then a lane now a highway conducted
to the curious little inland town named by the Havenpool man It is
unnecessary to describe Oozewood on the SouthAvon It has a railway at
the present day but thirty years of steam traffic past its precincts
have hardly modified its original features Surrounded by a sort of
freshwater lagoon dividing it from meadows and coppice its ancient
thatch and timber houses have barely made way even in the front street
for the ubiquitous modern brick and slate It neither increases nor
diminishes in size it is difficult to say what the inhabitants find to
do for though trades in woodware are still carried on there cannot be
enough of this class of work nowadays to maintain all the householders
the forests around having been so greatly thinned and curtailed At the
time of this tradition the forests were dense artificers in wood
abounded and the timber trade was brisk Every house in the town
without exception was of oak framework filled in with plaster and
covered with thatch the chimney being the only brick portion of the
structure Inquiry soon brought Roger the sailor to the door of Wall
the timberdealer referred to but it was some time before he was able to
gain admission to the lodging of his sister the people having plainly
received directions not to welcome strangers

She was sitting in an upper room on one of the lathbacked
willowbottomed shepherds chairs made on the spot then as to this
day and as they were probably made there in the days of the Heptarchy
In her lap was an infant which she had been suckling though now it had
fallen asleep so had the young mother herself for a few minutes under
the drowsing effects of solitude Hearing footsteps on the stairs she
awoke started up with a glad cry and ran to the door opening which she
met her brother on the threshold

O this is merry I didnt expect ee she said Ah RogerI thought
it was John Her tones fell to disappointment

The sailor kissed her looked at her sternly for a few moments and
pointing to the infant said You mean the father of this

Yes my husband said Edith

I hope so he answered

Why Roger Im marriedof a truth am I she cried

Shame upon ee if true If not true worse Master Stocker was an
honest man and ye should have respected his memory longer Where is thy
husband

He comes often I thought it was he now Our marriage has to be kept
secret for a whileit was done privily for certain reasons but we was
married at church like honest folkafore God we were Roger six months
after poor Stockers death

Twas too soon said Roger

I was living in a house alone I had nowhere to go to You were far
over sea in the New Found Land and John took me and brought me here

How often doth he come says Roger again

Once or twice weekly says she

I wish th dst waited till I returned dear Edy he said It mid be
you are a wifeI hope so But if so why this mystery Why this mean
and cramped lodging in this lonely copsecircled town Of what standing
is your husband and of where

He is of gentle breedinghis name is John I am not free to tell his
familyname He is said to be of London for safety sake but he really
lives in the county next adjoining this

Where in the next county

I do not know He has preferred not to tell me that I may not have the
secret forced from me to his and my hurt by bringing the marriage to
the ears of his kinsfolk and friends

Her brothers face flushed Our people have been honest townsmen well
reputed for long why should you readily take such humbling from a
sojourner of whom th st know nothing

They remained in constrained converse till her quick ear caught a sound
for which she might have been waitinga horses footfall It is John
said she This is his nightSaturday

Dont be frightened lest he should find me here said Roger I am on
the point of leaving I wish not to be a third party Say nothing at
all about my visit if it will incommode you so to do I will see thee
before I go afloat again

Speaking thus he left the room and descending the staircase let himself
out by the front door thinking he might obtain a glimpse of the
approaching horseman But that traveller had in the meantime gone
stealthily round to the back of the homestead and peering along the
pinionend of the house Roger discerned him unbridling and haltering his
horse with his own hands in the shed there

Roger retired to the neighbouring inn called the Black Lamb and
meditated This mysterious method of approach determined him after all
not to leave the place till he had ascertained more definite facts of his
sisters positionwhether she were the deluded victim of the stranger or
the wife she obviously believed herself to be Having eaten some supper
he left the inn it being now about eleven oclock He first looked into
the shed and finding the horse still standing there waited
irresolutely near the door of his sisters lodging Half an hour
elapsed and while thinking he would climb into a loft hard by for a
nights rest there seemed to be a movement within the shutters of the
sittingroom that his sister occupied Roger hid himself behind a faggot
stack near the back door rightly divining that his sisters visitor
would emerge by the way he had entered The door opened and the candle
she held in her hand lighted for a moment the strangers form showing it
to be that of a tall and handsome personage about forty years of age
and apparently of a superior position in life Edith was assisting him
to cloak himself which being done he took leave of her with a kiss and
left the house From the door she watched him bridle and saddle his
horse and having mounted and waved an adieu to her as she stood candle
in hand he turned out of the yard and rode away

The horse which bore him was or seemed to be a little lame and Roger
fancied from this that the riders journey was not likely to be a long
one Being light of foot he followed apace having no great difficulty
on such a still night in keeping within earshot some few miles the
horseman pausing more than once In this pursuit Roger discovered the
rider to choose bridletracks and open commons in preference to any high
road The distance soon began to prove a more trying one than he had
bargained for and when out of breath and in some despair of being able
to ascertain the mans identity he perceived an ass standing in the
starlight under a hayrick from which the animal was helping itself to
periodic mouthfuls

The story goes that Roger caught the ass mounted and again resumed the
trail of the unconscious horseman which feat may have been possible to a
nautical young fellow though one can hardly understand how a sailor
would ride such an animal without bridle or saddle and strange to his
hands unless the creature were extraordinarily docile This question
however is immaterial Suffice it to say that at dawn the following
morning Roger beheld his sisters lover or husband entering the gates of
a large and welltimbered park on the southwestern verge of the White
Hart Forest as it was then called now known to everybody as the Vale
of Blackmoor Thereupon the sailor discarded his steed and finding for
himself an obscurer entrance to the same park a little further on he
crossed the grass to reconnoitre

He presently perceived amid the trees before him a mansion which new to
himself was one of the best known in the county at that time Of this
fine manorial residence hardly a trace now remains but a manuscript
dated some years later than the events we are regarding describes it in
terms from which the imagination may construct a singularly clear and
vivid picture This record presents it as consisting of a faire yellow
freestone building partly two and partly three storeys a faire halle
and parlour both waynscotted a faire dyning roome and withdrawing
roome and many good lodgings a kitchen adjoyninge backwarde to one end
of the dwellinghouse with a faire passage from it into the halle
parlour and dyninge roome and sellars adjoyninge

In the front of the house a square greene court and a curious gatehouse
with lodgings in it standing with the front of the house to the south
in a large outer court three stables a coachhouse a large barne and a
stable for oxen and kyne and all houses necessary

Without the gatehouse paled in a large square greene in which
standeth a faire chappell of the southeast side of the greene court
towards the river a large garden

Of the southwest side of the greene court is a large bowling greene
with fower mounted walks about it all walled about with a batteled wall
and sett with all sorts of fruit and out of it into the feildes there
are large walks under many tall elmes orderly planted

Then follows a description of the orchards and gardens the servants
offices brewhouse bakehouse dairy pigeonhouses and cornmill the
river and its abundance of fish the warren the coppices the walks
ending thus

And all the country north of the house open champaign sandy feildes
very dry and pleasant for all kindes of recreation huntinge and
hawkinge and profitble for tillage    The house hath a large prospect
east south and west over a very large and pleasant vale    is
seated from the good markett towns of Sherton Abbas three miles and Ivel
a mile that plentifully yield all manner of provision and within twelve
miles of the south sea

It was on the grass before this seductive and picturesque structure that
the sailor stood at gaze under the elms in the dim dawn of Sunday
morning and saw to his surprise his sisters lover and horse vanish
within the court of the building

Perplexed and weary Roger slowly retreated more than ever convinced
that something was wrong in his sisters position He crossed the
bowling green to the avenue of elms and bent on further research was
about to climb into one of these when looking below he saw a heap of
hay apparently for horses or deer Into this he crept and having eaten
a crust of bread which he had hastily thrust into his pocket at the inn
he curled up and fell asleep the hay forming a comfortable bed and
quite covering him over

He slept soundly and long and was awakened by the sound of a bell On
peering from the hay he found the time had advanced to full day the sun
was shining brightly The bell was that of the faire chappell on the
green outside the gatehouse and it was calling to matins Presently the
priest crossed the green to a little sidedoor in the chancel and then
from the gateway of the mansion emerged the household the tall man whom
Roger had seen with his sister on the previous night on his arm being a
portly dame and running beside the pair two little girls and a boy
These all entered the chapel and the bell having ceased and the environs
become clear the sailor crept out from his hiding

He sauntered towards the chapel the opening words of the service being
audible within While standing by the porch he saw a belated servitor
approaching from the kitchencourt to attend the service also Roger
carelessly accosted him and asked as an idle wanderer the name of the
family he had just seen cross over from the mansion

Od zounds if ye modden be a stranger here in very truth goodman That
wer Sir John and his dame and his children Elizabeth Mary and John

I be from foreign parts Sir John what dye calln

Master John Horseleigh Knight who had amost as much lond by
inheritance of his mother as a had by his father and likewise some by
his wife Why baint his arms dree goolden horses heads and idden his
lady the daughter of Master Richard Phelipson of Montislope in Nether
Wessex known to us all

It mid be so and yet it mid not However th lt miss thy prayers for
such an honest knights welfare and I have to traipse seaward many
miles

He went onward and as he walked continued saying to himself Now to
that poor wronged fool Edy The fond thing I thought it twas too
quickshe was ever amorous Whats to become of her God wot How be
I going to face her with the news and how be I to hold it from her To
bring this disgrace on my fathers honoured name a doubletongued
knave He turned and shook his fist at the chapel and all in it and
resumed his way

Perhaps it was owing to the perplexity of his mind that instead of
returning by the direct road towards his sisters obscure lodging in the
next county he followed the highway to Casterbridge some fifteen miles
off where he remained drinking hard all that afternoon and evening and
where he lay that and two or three succeeding nights wandering thence
along the Anglebury road to some village that way and lying the Friday
night after at his native place of Havenpool The sight of the familiar
objects there seems to have stirred him anew to action and the next
morning he was observed pursuing the way to Oozewood that he had followed
on the Saturday previous reckoning no doubt that Saturday night would
as before be a time for finding Sir John with his sister again

He delayed to reach the place till just before sunset His sister was
walking in the meadows at the foot of the garden with a nursemaid who
carried the baby and she looked up pensively when he approached Anxiety
as to her position had already told upon her once rosy cheeks and lucid
eyes But concern for herself and child was displaced for the moment by
her regard of Rogers worn and haggard face

Whyyou are sick Rogeryou are tired Where have you been these many
days Why not keep me company a bitmy husband is much away And we
have hardly spoke at all of dear father and of your voyage to the New
Land Why did you go away so suddenly There is a spare chamber at my
lodging

Come indoors he said Well talk nowtalk a good deal As for him
nodding to the child better heave him into the river better for him
and you

She forced a laugh as if she tried to see a good joke in the remark and
they went silently indoors

A miserable hole said Roger looking round the room

Nay but tis very pretty

Not after what Ive seen Did he marry ee at church in orderly
fashion

He did sureat our church at Havenpool

But in a privy way

Aybecause of his friendsit was at nighttime

Ede ye fond onefor all that hes not thy husband Th rt not his
wife and the child is a bastard He hath a wife and children of his own
rank and bearing his name and thats Sir John Horseleigh of Clyfton
Horseleigh and not plain Jack as you think him and your lawful
husband The sacrament of marriage is no safeguard nowadays The Kings
newmade headship of the Church hath led men to practise these tricks
lightly

She had turned white Thats not true Roger she said You are in
liquor my brother and you know not what you say Your seafaring years
have taught ee bad things

EdithIve seen them wife and familyall How canst

They were sitting in the gathered darkness and at that moment steps were
heard without Go out this way she said It is my husband He must
not see thee in this mood Get away till tomorrow Roger as you care
for me

She pushed her brother through a door leading to the back stairs and
almost as soon as it was closed her visitor entered Roger however did
not retreat down the stairs he stood and looked through the bobbinhole
If the visitor turned out to be Sir John he had determined to confront
him

It was the knight She had struck a light on his entry and he kissed
the child and took Edith tenderly by the shoulders looking into her
face

Somethings gone awry wi my dear he said What is it Whats the
matter

O Jack she cried I have heard such a fearsome rumourwhat doth it
mean He who told me is my best friend He must be deceived But who
deceived him and why Jack I was just told that you had a wife living
when you married me and have her still

A wifeHm

Yes and children Say no say no

By God I have no lawful wife but you and as for children many or
few they are all bastards save this one alone

And that you be Sir John Horseleigh of Clyfton

I mid be I have never said so to ee

But Sir John is known to have a lady and issue of her

The knight looked down How did thy mind get filled with such as this
he asked

One of my kindred came

A traitor Why should he mar our life Ah you said you had a brother
at seawhere is he now

Here came from close behind him And flinging open the door Roger
faced the intruder Liar he said to call thyself her husband

Sir John fired up and made a rush at the sailor who seized him by the
collar and in the wrestle they both fell Roger under But in a few
seconds he contrived to extricate his right arm and drawing from his
belt a knife which he wore attached to a cord round his neck he opened it
with his teeth and struck it into the breast of Sir John stretched above
him Edith had during these moments run into the next room to place the
child in safety and when she came back the knight was relaxing his hold
on Rogers throat He rolled over upon his back and groaned

The only witness of the scene save the three concerned was the nursemaid
who had brought in the child on its fathers arrival She stated
afterwards that nobody suspected Sir John had received his death wound
yet it was so though he did not die for a long while meaning thereby an
hour or two that Mistress Edith continually endeavoured to staunch the
blood calling her brother Roger a wretch and ordering him to get
himself gone on which order he acted after a gloomy pause by opening
the window and letting himself down by the sill to the ground

It was then that Sir John in difficult accents made his dying
declaration to the nurse and Edith and later the apothecary which was
to this purport that the Dame Horseleigh who passed as his wife at
Clyfton and who had borne him three children was in truth and deed
though unconsciously the wife of another man Sir John had married her
several years before in the face of the whole county as the widow of
one Decimus Strong who had disappeared shortly after her union with him
having adventured to the North to join the revolt of the Nobles and on
that revolt being quelled retreated across the sea Two years ago
having discovered this man to be still living in France and not wishing
to disturb the mind and happiness of her who believed herself his wife
yet wishing for legitimate issue Sir John had informed the King of the
facts who had encouraged him to wed honestly though secretly the young
merchants widow at Havenpool she being therefore his lawful wife and
she only That to avoid all scandal and hubbub he had purposed to let
things remain as they were till fair opportunity should arise of making
the true case known with least pain to all parties concerned but that
having been thus suspected and attacked by his own brotherinlaw his
zest for such schemes and for all things had died out in him and he only
wished to commend his soul to God

That night while the owls were hooting from the forest that encircled
the sleeping townlet and the SouthAvon was gurgling through the wooden
piles of the bridge Sir John died there in the arms of his wife She
concealed nothing of the cause of her husbands death save the subject of
the quarrel which she felt it would be premature to announce just then
and until proof of her status should be forthcoming But before a month
had passed it happened to her inexpressible sorrow that the child of
this clandestine union fell sick and died From that hour all interest
in the name and fame of the Horseleighs forsook the younger of the twain
who called themselves wives of Sir John and being careless about her
own fame she took no steps to assert her claims her legal position
having indeed grown hateful to her in her horror at the tragedy And
Sir William Byrt the curate who had married her to her husband being an
old man and feeble was not disinclined to leave the embers unstirred of
such a fiery matter as this and to assist her in letting established
things stand Therefore Edith retired with the nurse her only
companion and friend to her native town where she lived in absolute
obscurity till her death in middle age Her brother was never seen again
in England

A strangely corroborative sequel to the story remains to be told Shortly
after the death of Sir John Horseleigh a soldier of fortune returned
from the Continent called on Dame Horseleigh the fictitious living in
widowed state at Clyfton Horseleigh and after a singularly brief
courtship married her The tradition at Havenpool and elsewhere has
ever been that this man was already her husband Decimus Strong who
remarried her for appearance sake only

The illegitimate son of this lady by Sir John succeeded to the estates
and honours and his son after him there being nobody on the alert to
investigate their pretensions Little difference would it have made to
the present generation however had there been such a one for the
family in all its branches lawful and unlawful has been extinct these
many score years the last representative but one being killed at the
siege of Sherton Castle while attacking in the service of the
Parliament and the other being outlawed later in the same century for a
debt of ten pounds and dying in the county jail The mansion house and
its appurtenances were as I have previously stated destroyed excepting
one small wing which now forms part of a farmhouse and is visible as
you pass along the railway from Casterbridge to Ivel The outline of the
old bowlinggreen is also distinctly to be seen

This then is the reason why the only lawful marriage of Sir John as
recorded in the obscure register at Havenpool does not appear in the
pedigree of the house of Horseleigh

Spring 1893




THE DUKES REAPPEARANCEA FAMILY TRADITION


According to the kinsman who told me the story Christopher Swetmans
house on the outskirts of KingsHintock village was in those days
larger and better kept than when many years later it was sold to the
lord of the manor adjoining after having been in the Swetman family as
one may say since the Conquest

Some people would have it to be that the thing happened at the house
opposite belonging to one Childs with whose family the Swetmans
afterwards intermarried But that it was at the original homestead of
the Swetmans can be shown in various ways chiefly by the unbroken
traditions of the family and indirectly by the evidence of the walls
themselves which are the only ones thereabout with windows mullioned in
the Elizabethan manner and plainly of a date anterior to the event
while those of the other house might well have been erected fifty or
eighty years later and probably were since the choice of Swetmans
house by the fugitive was doubtless dictated by no other circumstance
than its then suitable loneliness

It was a cloudy July morning just before dawn the hour of two having
been struck by Swetmans onehanded clock on the stairs that is still
preserved in the family Christopher heard the strokes from his chamber
immediately at the top of the staircase and overlooking the front of the
house He did not wonder that he was sleepless The rumours and
excitements which had latterly stirred the neighbourhood to the effect
that the rightful King of England had landed from Holland at a port only
eighteen miles to the southwest of Swetmans house were enough to make
wakeful and anxious even a contented yeoman like him Some of the
villagers intoxicated by the news had thrown down their scythes and
rushed to the ranks of the invader Christopher Swetman had weighed both
sides of the question and had remained at home

Now as he lay thinking of these and other things he fancied that he could
hear the footfall of a man on the road leading up to his housea byway
which led scarce anywhere else and therefore a tread was at any time
more apt to startle the inmates of the homestead than if it had stood in
a thoroughfare The footfall came opposite the gate and stopped there
One minute two minutes passed and the pedestrian did not proceed
Christopher Swetman got out of bed and opened the casement Hoi whos
there cries he

A friend came from the darkness

And what mid ye want at this time o night says Swetman

Shelter Ive lost my way

Whats thy name

There came no answer

Be ye one of King Monmouths men

He that asks no questions will hear no lies from me I am a stranger
and I am spent and hungered Can you let me lie with you tonight

Swetman was generous to people in trouble and his house was roomy Wait
a bit he said and Ill come down and have a look at thee anyhow

He struck a light put on his clothes and descended taking his horn
lantern from a nail in the passage and lighting it before opening the
door The rays fell on the form of a tall dark man in cavalry
accoutrements and wearing a sword He was pale with fatigue and covered
with mud though the weather was dry

Prithee take no heed of my appearance said the stranger But let me
in

That his visitor was in sore distress admitted of no doubt and the
yeomans natural humanity assisted the others sad importunity and gentle
voice Swetman took him in not without a suspicion that this man
represented in some way Monmouths cause to which he was not unfriendly
in his secret heart At his earnest request the newcomer was given a
suit of the yeomans old clothes in exchange for his own which with his
sword were hidden in a closet in Swetmans chamber food was then put
before him and a lodging provided for him in a room at the back

Here he slept till quite late in the morning which was Sunday the sixth
of July and when he came down in the garments that he had borrowed he
met the household with a melancholy smile Besides Swetman himself
there were only his two daughters Grace and Leonard the latter was
oddly enough a womans name here and both had been enjoined to
secrecy They asked no questions and received no information though the
stranger regarded their fair countenances with an interest almost too
deep Having partaken of their usual breakfast of ham and cider he
professed weariness and retired to the chamber whence he had come

In a couple of hours or thereabout he came down again the two young
women having now gone off to morning service Seeing Christopher
bustling about the house without assistance he asked if he could do
anything to aid his host

As he seemed anxious to hide all differences and appear as one of
themselves Swetman set him to get vegetables from the garden and fetch
water from Buttocks Spring in the dip near the house though the spring
was not called by that name till years after by the way

And what can I do next says the stranger when these services had been
performed

His meekness and docility struck Christopher much and won upon him
Since you be minded to says the latter you can take down the dishes
and spread the table for dinner Take a pewter plate for thyself but
the trenchers will do for we

But the other would not and took a trencher likewise in doing which he
spoke of the two girls and remarked how comely they were

This quietude was put an end to by a stir out of doors which was
sufficient to draw Swetmans attention to it and he went out Farm
hands who had gone off and joined the Duke on his arrival had begun to
come in with news that a midnight battle had been fought on the moors to
the north the Dukes men who had attacked being entirely worsted the
Duke himself with one or two lords and other friends had fled no one
knew whither

There has been a battle says Swetman on coming indoors after these
tidings and looking earnestly at the stranger

May the victory be to the rightful in the end whatever the issue now
says the other with a sorrowful sigh

Dost really know nothing about it said Christopher I could have
sworn you was one from that very battle

I was here before three o the clock this morning and these men have
only arrived now

True said the yeoman But still I think

Do not press your question the stranger urged I am in a strait and
can refuse a helper nothing such inquiry is therefore unfair

True again said Swetman and held his tongue

The daughters of the house returned from church where the service had
been hurried by reason of the excitement To their fathers questioning
if they had spoken of him who sojourned there they replied that they had
said never a word which indeed was true as events proved

He bade them serve the dinner and as the visitor had withdrawn since
the news of the battle prepared to take a platter to him upstairs But
he preferred to come down and dine with the family

During the afternoon more fugitives passed through the village but
Christopher Swetman his visitor and his family kept indoors In the
evening however Swetman came out from his gate and harkening in
silence to these tidings and more wondered what might be in store for
him for his last nights work

He returned homeward by a path across the mead that skirted his own
orchard Passing here he heard the voice of his daughter Leonard
expostulating inside the hedge her words being Dont ye sir dont I
prithee let me go

Why sweetheart

Because Ive apromised another

Peeping through as he could not help doing he saw the girl struggling
in the arms of the stranger who was attempting to kiss her but finding
her resistance to be genuine and her distress unfeigned he reluctantly
let her go

Swetmans face grew dark for his girls were more to him than himself He
hastened on meditating moodily all the way He entered the gate and
made straight for the orchard When he reached it his daughter had
disappeared but the stranger was still standing there

Sir said the yeoman his anger having in no wise abated Ive seen
what has happened I have taken ee into my house at some jeopardy to
myself and whoever you be the least I expected of ee was to treat the
maidens with a seemly respect You have not done it and I no longer
trust you I am the more watchful over them in that they are motherless
and I must ask ee to go after dark this night

The stranger seemed dazed at discovering what his impulse had brought
down upon his head and his pale face grew paler He did not reply for a
time When he did speak his soft voice was thick with feeling

Sir says he I own that I am in the wrong if you take the matter
gravely We do not what we would but what we must Though I have not
injured your daughter as a woman I have been treacherous to her as a
hostess and friend in need Ill go as you say I can do no less I
shall doubtless find a refuge elsewhere

They walked towards the house in silence where Swetman insisted that his
guest should have supper before departing By the time this was eaten it
was dusk and the stranger announced that he was ready

They went upstairs to where the garments and sword lay hidden till the
departing one said that on further thought he would ask another favour
that he should be allowed to retain the clothes he wore and that his
host would keep the others and the sword till he the speaker should
come or send for them

As you will said Swetman The gain is on my side for those clouts
were but kept to dress a scarecrow next fall

They suit my case said the stranger sadly However much they may
misfit me they do not misfit my sorry fortune now

Nay then said Christopher relenting I was too hasty Shlt bide

But the other would not saying that it was better that things should
take their course Notwithstanding that Swetman importuned him he only
added If I never come again do with my belongings as you list In the
pocket you will find a gold snuffbox and in the snuffbox fifty gold
pieces

But keep em for thy use man said the yeoman

No says the parting guest they are foreign pieces and would harm me
if I were taken Do as I bid thee Put away these things again and take
especial charge of the sword It belonged to my fathers father and I
value it much But something more common becomes me now

Saying which he took as he went downstairs one of the ash sticks used
by Swetman himself for walking with The yeoman lighted him out to the
garden hatch where he disappeared through Clammers Gate by the road that
crosses KingsHintock Park to Evershead

Christopher returned to the upstairs chamber and sat down on his bed
reflecting Then he examined the things left behind and surely enough
in one of the pockets the gold snuffbox was revealed containing the
fifty gold pieces as stated by the fugitive The yeoman next looked at
the sword which its owner had stated to have belonged to his grandfather
It was twoedged so that he almost feared to handle it On the blade
was inscribed the words ANDREA FERARA and among the many fine chasings
were a rose and crown the plume of the Prince of Wales and two
portraits portraits of a man and a woman the mans having the face of
the first King Charles and the womans apparently that of his Queen

Swetman much awed and surprised returned the articles to the closet
and went downstairs pondering Of his surmise he said nothing to his
daughters merely declaring to them that the gentleman was gone and
never revealing that he had been an eyewitness of the unpleasant scene
in the orchard that was the immediate cause of the departure

Nothing occurred in Hintock during the week that followed beyond the
fitful arrival of more decided tidings concerning the utter defeat of the
Dukes army and his own disappearance at an early stage of the battle
Then it was told that Monmouth was taken not in his own clothes but in
the disguise of a countryman He had been sent to London and was
confined in the Tower

The possibility that his guest had been no other than the Duke made
Swetman unspeakably sorry now his heart smote him at the thought that
acting so harshly for such a small breach of good faith he might have
been the means of forwarding the unhappy fugitives capture On the
girls coming up to him he said Get away with ye wenches I fear you
have been the ruin of an unfortunate man

On the Tuesday night following when the yeoman was sleeping as usual in
his chamber he was he said conscious of the entry of some one Opening
his eyes he beheld by the light of the moon which shone upon the front
of his house the figure of a man who seemed to be the stranger moving
from the door towards the closet He was dressed somewhat differently
now but the face was quite that of his late guest in its tragical
pensiveness as was also the tallness of his figure He neared the
closet and feeling his visitor to be within his rights Christopher
refrained from stirring The personage turned his large haggard eyes
upon the bed where Swetman lay and then withdrew from their hiding the
articles that belonged to him again giving a hard gaze at Christopher as
he went noiselessly out of the chamber with his properties on his arm
His retreat down the stairs was just audible and also his departure by
the side door through which entrance or exit was easy to those who knew
the place

Nothing further happened and towards morning Swetman slept To avoid
all risk he said not a word to the girls of the visit of the night and
certainly not to any one outside the house for it was dangerous at that
time to avow anything

Among the killed in opposing the recent rising had been a younger brother
of the lord of the manor who lived at KingsHintock Court hard by
Seeing the latter ride past in mourning clothes next day Swetman
ventured to condole with him

Hed no business there answered the other His words and manner
showed the bitterness that was mingled with his regret But say no more
of him You know what has happened since I suppose

I know that they say Monmouth is taken Sir Thomas but I cant think it
true answered Swetman

O zounds tis true enough cried the knight and thats not all The
Duke was executed on Tower Hill two days ago

Dye say it verily says Swetman

And a very hard death he had worse luck for n said Sir Thomas
Well tis over for him and over for my brother But not for the rest
Therell be searchings and siftings down here anon and happy is the man
who has had nothing to do with this matter

Now Swetman had hardly heard the latter words so much was he confounded
by the strangeness of the tidings that the Duke had come to his death on
the previous Tuesday For it had been only the night before this present
day of Friday that he had seen his former guest whom he had ceased to
doubt could be other than the Duke come into his chamber and fetch away
his accoutrements as he had promised

It couldnt have been a vision said Christopher to himself when the
knight had ridden on But Ill go straight and see if the things be in
the closet still and thus I shall surely learn if twere a vision or
no

To the closet he went which he had not looked into since the strangers
departure And searching behind the articles placed to conceal the
things hidden he found that as he had never doubted they were gone

When the rumour spread abroad in the West that the man beheaded in the
Tower was not indeed the Duke but one of his officers taken after the
battle and that the Duke had been assisted to escape out of the country
Swetman found in it an explanation of what so deeply mystified him That
his visitor might have been a friend of the Dukes whom the Duke had
asked to fetch the things in a last request Swetman would never admit
His belief in the rumour that Monmouth lived like that of thousands of
others continued to the end of his days

    

Such briefly concluded my kinsman is the tradition which has been
handed down in Christopher Swetmans family for the last two hundred
years




A MERE INTERLUDE


CHAPTER I


The traveller in schoolbooks who vouched in dryest tones for the
fidelity to fact of the following narrative used to add a ring of truth
to it by opening with a nicety of criticism on the heroines personality
People were wrong he declared when they surmised that Baptista Trewthen
was a young woman with scarcely emotions or character There was nothing
in her to love and nothing to hateso ran the general opinion That
she showed few positive qualities was true The colours and tones which
changing events paint on the faces of active womankind were looked for in
vain upon hers But still waters run deep and no crisis had come in the
years of her early maidenhood to demonstrate what lay hidden within her
like metal in a mine

She was the daughter of a small farmer in St Marias one of the Isles
of Lyonesse beyond OffWessex who had spent a large sum as there
understood on her education by sending her to the mainland for two
years At nineteen she was entered at the Training College for Teachers
and at twentyone nominated to a school in the country near Torupon
Sea whither she proceeded after the Christmas examination and holidays

The months passed by from winter to spring and summer and Baptista
applied herself to her new duties as best she could till an uneventful
year had elapsed Then an air of abstraction pervaded her bearing as she
walked to and fro twice a day and she showed the traits of a person who
had something on her mind A widow by name Mrs Wace in whose house
Baptista Trewthen had been provided with a sittingroom and bedroom till
the schoolhouse should be built noticed this change in her youthful
tenants manner and at last ventured to press her with a few questions

It has nothing to do with the place nor with you said Miss Trewthen

Then it is the salary

No nor the salary

Then it is something you have heard from home my dear

Baptista was silent for a few moments It is Mr Heddegan she
murmured Him they used to call David Heddegan before he got his
money

And who is the Mr Heddegan they used to call David

An old bachelor at Giants Town St Marias with no relations
whatever who lives about a stones throw from fathers When I was a
child he used to take me on his knee and say hed marry me some day Now
I am a woman the jest has turned earnest and he is anxious to do it And
father and mother says I cant do better than have him

Hes well off

Yeshes the richest man we knowas a friend and neighbour

How much older did you say he was than yourself

I didnt say Twenty years at least

And an unpleasant man in the bargain perhaps

Nohes not unpleasant

Well child all I can say is that Id resist any such engagement if
its not palatable to ee You are comfortable here in my little house
I hope All the parish like ee and Ive never been so cheerful since
my poor husband left me to wear his wings as Ive been with ee as my
lodger

The schoolmistress assured her landlady that she could return the
sentiment But here comes my perplexity she said I dont like
keeping school Ah you are surprisedyou didnt suspect it Thats
because Ive concealed my feeling Well I simply hate school I dont
care for childrenthey are unpleasant troublesome little things whom
nothing would delight so much as to hear that you had fallen down dead
Yet I would even put up with them if it was not for the inspector For
three months before his visit I didnt sleep soundly And the Committee
of Council are always changing the Code so that you dont know what to
teach and what to leave untaught I think father and mother are right
They say I shall never excel as a schoolmistress if I dislike the work
so and that therefore I ought to get settled by marrying Mr Heddegan
Between us two I like him better than school but I dont like him quite
so much as to wish to marry him

These conversations once begun were continued from day to day till at
length the young girls elderly friend and landlady threw in her opinion
on the side of Miss Trewthens parents All things considered she
declared the uncertainty of the school the labour Baptistas natural
dislike for teaching it would be as well to take what fate offered and
make the best of matters by wedding her fathers old neighbour and
prosperous friend

The Easter holidays came round and Baptista went to spend them as usual
in her native isle going by train into OffWessex and crossing by packet
from Penzephyr When she returned in the middle of April her face wore
a more settled aspect

Well said the expectant Mrs Wace

I have agreed to have him as my husband said Baptista in an offhand
way Heaven knows if it will be for the best or not But I have agreed
to do it and so the matter is settled

Mrs Wace commended her but Baptista did not care to dwell on the
subject so that allusion to it was very infrequent between them
Nevertheless among other things she repeated to the widow from time to
time in monosyllabic remarks that the wedding was really impending that
it was arranged for the summer and that she had given notice of leaving
the school at the August holidays Later on she announced more
specifically that her marriage was to take place immediately after her
return home at the beginning of the month aforesaid

She now corresponded regularly with Mr Heddegan Her letters from him
were seen at least on the outside and in part within by Mrs Wace Had
she read more of their interiors than the occasional sentences shown her
by Baptista she would have perceived that the scratchy rusty handwriting
of Miss Trewthens betrothed conveyed little more matter than details of
their future housekeeping and his preparations for the same with
innumerable my dears sprinkled in disconnectedly to show the depth of
his affection without the inconveniences of syntax



CHAPTER II


It was the end of Julydry too dry even for the season the delicate
green herbs and vegetables that grew in this favoured end of the kingdom
tasting rather of the wateringpot than of the pure fresh moisture from
the skies Baptistas boxes were packed and one Saturday morning she
departed by a waggonette to the station and thence by train to
Penzephyr from which port she was as usual to cross the water
immediately to her home and become Mr Heddegans wife on the Wednesday
of the week following

She might have returned a week sooner But though the wedding day had
loomed so near and the banns were out she delayed her departure till
this last moment saying it was not necessary for her to be at home long
beforehand As Mr Heddegan was older than herself she said she was to
be married in her ordinary summer bonnet and grey silk frock and there
were no preparations to make that had not been amply made by her parents
and intended husband

In due time after a hot and tedious journey she reached Penzephyr She
here obtained some refreshment and then went towards the pier where she
learnt to her surprise that the little steamboat plying between the town
and the islands had left at eleven oclock the usual hour of departure
in the afternoon having been forestalled in consequence of the fogs which
had for a few days prevailed towards evening making twilight navigation
dangerous

This being Saturday there was now no other boat till Tuesday and it
became obvious that here she would have to remain for the three days
unless her friends should think fit to rig out one of the island sailing
boats and come to fetch hera not very likely contingency the sea
distance being nearly forty miles

Baptista however had been detained in Penzephyr on more than one
occasion before either on account of bad weather or some such reason as
the present and she was therefore not in any personal alarm But as
she was to be married on the following Wednesday the delay was certainly
inconvenient to a more than ordinary degree since it would leave less
than a days interval between her arrival and the wedding ceremony

Apart from this awkwardness she did not much mind the accident It was
indeed curious to see how little she minded Perhaps it would not be too
much to say that although she was going to do the critical deed of her
life quite willingly she experienced an indefinable relief at the
postponement of her meeting with Heddegan But her manner after making
discovery of the hindrance was quiet and subdued even to passivity
itself as was instanced by her having at the moment of receiving
information that the steamer had sailed replied Oh so coolly to the
porter with her luggage that he was almost disappointed at her lack of
disappointment

The question now was should she return again to Mrs Wace in the
village of Lower Wessex or wait in the town at which she had arrived
She would have preferred to go back but the distance was too great
moreover having left the place for good and somewhat dramatically to
become a bride a return even for so short a space would have been a
trifle humiliating

Leaving then her boxes at the station her next anxiety was to secure a
respectable or rather genteel lodging in the popular seaside resort
confronting her To this end she looked about the town in which though
she had passed through it halfadozen times she was practically a
stranger

Baptista found a room to suit her over a fruiterers shop where she made
herself at home and set herself in order after her journey An early
cup of tea having revived her spirits she walked out to reconnoitre

Being a schoolmistress she avoided looking at the schools and having a
sort of trade connection with books she avoided looking at the
booksellers but wearying of the other shops she inspected the churches
not that for her own part she cared much about ecclesiastical edifices
but tourists looked at them and so would shea proceeding for which no
one would have credited her with any great originality such for
instance as that she subsequently showed herself to possess The
churches soon oppressed her She tried the Museum but came out because
it seemed lonely and tedious

Yet the town and the walks in this land of strawberries these
headquarters of early English flowers and fruit were then as always
attractive From the more picturesque streets she went to the town
gardens and the Pier and the Harbour and looked at the men at work
there loading and unloading as in the time of the Phoenicians

Not Baptista Yes Baptista it is

The words were uttered behind her Turning round she gave a start and
became confused even agitated for a moment Then she said in her usual
undemonstrative manner Ois it really you Charles

Without speaking again at once and with a halfsmile the newcomer
glanced her over There was much criticism and some resentmenteven
temperin his eye

I am going home continued she But I have missed the boat

He scarcely seemed to take in the meaning of this explanation in the
intensity of his critical survey Teaching still What a fine
schoolmistress you make Baptista I warrant he said with a slight
flavour of sarcasm which was not lost upon her

I know I am nothing to brag of she replied Thats why I have given
up

Ogiven up You astonish me

I hate the profession

Perhaps thats because I am in it

O no it isnt But I am going to enter on another life altogether I
am going to be married next week to Mr David Heddegan

The young manfortified as he was by a natural cynical pride and
passionatenesswinced at this unexpected reply notwithstanding

Who is Mr David Heddegan he asked as indifferently as lay in his
power

She informed him the bearer of the name was a general merchant of Giants
Town St Marias islandher fathers nearest neighbour and oldest
friend

Then we shant see anything more of you on the mainland inquired the
schoolmaster

O I dont know about that said Miss Trewthen

Here endeth the career of the belle of the boardingschool your father
was foolish enough to send you to A general merchants wife in the
Lyonesse Isles Will you sell pounds of soap and pennyworths of tin
tacks or whole bars of saponaceous matter and great tenpenny nails

Hes not in such a small way as that she almost pleaded He owns
ships though they are rather little ones

O well it is much the same Come let us walk on it is tedious to
stand still I thought you would be a failure in education he
continued when she obeyed him and strolled ahead You never showed
power that way You remind me much of some of those women who think they
are sure to be great actresses if they go on the stage because they have
a pretty face and forget that what we require is acting But you found
your mistake didnt you

Dont taunt me Charles It was noticeable that the young
schoolmasters tone caused her no anger or retaliatory passion far
otherwise there was a tear in her eye How is it you are at
Penzephyr she inquired

I dont taunt you I speak the truth purely in a friendly way as I
should to any one I wished well Though for that matter I might have
some excuse even for taunting you Such a terrible hurry as youve been
in I hate a woman who is in such a hurry

How do you mean that

Whyto be somebodys wife or otheranythings wife rather than
nobodys You couldnt wait for me O no Well thank God Im cured
of all that

How merciless you are she said bitterly Wait for you What does
that mean Charley You never showedanything to wait foranything
special towards me

O come Baptista dear come

What I mean is nothing definite she expostulated I suppose you
liked me a little but it seemed to me to be only a pastime on your part
and that you never meant to make an honourable engagement of it

There thats just it You girls expect a man to mean business at the
first look No man when he first becomes interested in a woman has any
definite scheme of engagement to marry her in his mind unless he is
meaning a vulgar mercenary marriage However I did at last mean an
honourable engagement as you call it come to that

But you never said so and an indefinite courtship soon injures a
womans position and credit sooner than you think

Baptista I solemnly declare that in six months I should have asked you
to marry me

She walked along in silence looking on the ground and appearing very
uncomfortable Presently he said Would you have waited for me if you
had known To this she whispered in a sorrowful whisper Yes

They went still farther in silencepassing along one of the beautiful
walks on the outskirts of the town yet not observant of scene or
situation Her shoulder and his were close together and he clasped his
fingers round the small of her armquite lightly and without any
attempt at impetus yet the act seemed to say Now I hold you and my
will must be yours

Recurring to a previous question of hers he said I have merely run down
here for a day or two from school near Trufal before going off to the
north for the rest of my holiday I have seen my relations at Redrutin
quite lately so I am not going there this time How little I thought of
meeting you How very different the circumstances would have been if
instead of parting again as we must in halfanhour or so possibly for
ever you had been now just going off with me as my wife on our
honeymoon trip Hahawellso humorous is life

She stopped suddenly I must go back nowthis is altogether too
painful Charley It is not at all a kind mood you are in today

I dont want to pain youyou know I do not he said more gently Only
it just exasperates methis you are going to do I wish you would not

What

Marry him There now I have showed you my true sentiments

I must do it now said she

Why he asked dropping the offhand masterful tone he had hitherto
spoken in and becoming earnest still holding her arm however as if
she were his chattel to be taken up or put down at will It is never
too late to break off a marriage thats distasteful to you Now Ill say
one thing and it is truth I wish you would marry me instead of him
even now at the last moment though you have served me so badly

O it is not possible to think of that she answered hastily shaking
her head When I get home all will be preparedit is ready even
nowthe things for the party the furniture Mr Heddegans new suit
and everything I should require the courage of a tropical lion to go
home there and say I wouldnt carry out my promise

Then go in Heavens name But there would be no necessity for you to
go home and face them in that way If we were to marry it would have to
be at once instantly or not at all I should think your affection not
worth the having unless you agreed to come back with me to Trufal this
evening where we could be married by licence on Monday morning And
then no Mr David Heddegan or anybody else could get you away from me

I must go home by the Tuesday boat she faltered What would they
think if I did not come

You could go home by that boat just the same All the difference would
be that I should go with you You could leave me on the quay where Id
have a smoke while you went and saw your father and mother privately
you could then tell them what you had done and that I was waiting not
far off that I was a schoolmaster in a fairly good position and a
young man you had known when you were at the Training College Then I
would come boldly forward and they would see that it could not be
altered and so you wouldnt suffer a lifelong misery by being the wife
of a wretched old gaffer you dont like at all Now honestly you do
like me best dont you Baptista

Yes

Then we will do as I say

She did not pronounce a clear affirmative But that she consented to the
novel proposition at some moment or other of that walk was apparent by
what occurred a little later



CHAPTER III


An enterprise of such pith required indeed less talking than
consideration The first thing they did in carrying it out was to return
to the railway station where Baptista took from her luggage a small
trunk of immediate necessaries which she would in any case have required
after missing the boat That same afternoon they travelled up the line
to Trufal

Charles Stow as his name was despite his disdainful indifference to
things was very careful of appearances and made the journey
independently of her though in the same train He told her where she
could get board and lodgings in the city and with merely a distant nod
to her of a provisional kind went off to his own quarters and to see
about the licence

On Sunday she saw him in the morning across the nave of the
procathedral In the afternoon they walked together in the fields
where he told her that the licence would be ready next day and would be
available the day after when the ceremony could be performed as early
after eight oclock as they should choose

His courtship thus renewed after an interval of two years was as
impetuous violent even as it was short The next day came and passed
and the final arrangements were made Their agreement was to get the
ceremony over as soon as they possibly could the next morning so as to
go on to Penzephyr at once and reach that place in time for the boats
departure the same day It was in obedience to Baptistas earnest
request that Stow consented thus to make the whole journey to Lyonesse by
land and water at one heat and not break it at Penzephyr she seemed to
be oppressed with a dread of lingering anywhere this great first act of
disobedience to her parents once accomplished with the weight on her
mind that her home had to be convulsed by the disclosure of it To face
her difficulties over the water immediately she had created them was
however a course more desired by Baptista than by her lover though for
once he gave way

The next morning was bright and warm as those which had preceded it By
six oclock it seemed nearly noon as is often the case in that part of
England in the summer season By nine they were husband and wife They
packed up and departed by the earliest train after the service and on
the way discussed at length what she should say on meeting her parents
Charley dictating the turn of each phrase In her anxiety they had
travelled so early that when they reached Penzephyr they found there
were nearly two hours on their hands before the steamers time of
sailing

Baptista was extremely reluctant to be seen promenading the streets of
the wateringplace with her husband till as above stated the household
at Giants Town should know the unexpected course of events from her own
lips and it was just possible if not likely that some Lyonessian might
be prowling about there or even have come across the sea to look for
her To meet any one to whom she was known and to have to reply to
awkward questions about the strange young man at her side before her well
framed announcement had been delivered at proper time and place was a
thing she could not contemplate with equanimity So instead of looking
at the shops and harbour they went along the coast a little way

The heat of the morning was by this time intense They clambered up on
some cliffs and while sitting there looking around at St Michaels
Mount and other objects Charles said to her that he thought he would run
down to the beach at their feet and take just one plunge into the sea

Baptista did not much like the idea of being left alone it was gloomy
she said But he assured her he would not be gone more than a quarter of
an hour at the outside and she passively assented

Down he went disappeared appeared again and looked back Then he
again proceeded and vanished till as a small waxen object she saw him
emerge from the nook that had screened him cross the white fringe of
foam and walk into the undulating mass of blue Once in the water he
seemed less inclined to hurry than before he remained a long time and
unable either to appreciate his skill or criticize his want of it at that
distance she withdrew her eyes from the spot and gazed at the still
outline of St Michaelsnow beautifully toned in grey

Her anxiety for the hour of departure and to cope at once with the
approaching incidents that she would have to manipulate as best she
could sent her into a reverie It was now Tuesday she would reach home
in the eveninga very late time they would say but as the delay was a
pure accident they would deem her marriage to Mr Heddegan tomorrow
still practicable Then Charles would have to be produced from the
background It was a terrible undertaking to think of and she almost
regretted her temerity in wedding so hastily that morning The rage of
her father would be so crushing the reproaches of her mother so bitter
and perhaps Charles would answer hotly and perhaps cause estrangement
till death There had obviously been no alarm about her at St Marias
or somebody would have sailed across to inquire for her She had in a
letter written at the beginning of the week spoken of the hour at which
she intended to leave her country schoolhouse and from this her friends
had probably perceived that by such timing she would run a risk of losing
the Saturday boat She had missed it and as a consequence sat here on
the shore as Mrs Charles Stow

This brought her to the present and she turned from the outline of St
Michaels Mount to look about for her husbands form He was as far as
she could discover no longer in the sea Then he was dressing By
moving a few steps she could see where his clothes lay But Charles was
not beside them

Baptista looked back again at the water in bewilderment as if her senses
were the victim of some sleight of hand Not a speck or spot resembling
a mans head or face showed anywhere By this time she was alarmed and
her alarm intensified when she perceived a little beyond the scene of her
husbands bathing a small area of water the quality of whose surface
differed from that of the surrounding expanse as the coarse vegetation of
some foul patch in a mead differs from the fine green of the remainder
Elsewhere it looked flexuous here it looked vermiculated and lumpy and
her marine experiences suggested to her in a moment that two currents met
and caused a turmoil at this place

She descended as hastily as her trembling limbs would allow The way
down was terribly long and before reaching the heap of clothes it
occurred to her that after all it would be best to run first for help
Hastening along in a lateral direction she proceeded inland till she met
a man and soon afterwards two others To them she exclaimed I think a
gentleman who was bathing is in some danger I cannot see him as I
could Will you please run and help him at once if you will be so
kind

She did not think of turning to show them the exact spot indicating it
vaguely by the direction of her hand and still going on her way with the
idea of gaining more assistance When she deemed in her faintness that
she had carried the alarm far enough she faced about and dragged herself
back again Before reaching the now dreaded spot she met one of the men

We can see nothing at all Miss he declared

Having gained the beach she found the tide in and no sign of Charleys
clothes The other men whom she had besought to come had disappeared it
must have been in some other direction for she had not met them going
away They finding nothing had probably thought her alarm a mere
conjecture and given up the quest

Baptista sank down upon the stones near at hand Where Charley had
undressed was now sea There could not be the least doubt that he was
drowned and his body sucked under by the current while his clothes
lying within highwater mark had probably been carried away by the
rising tide

She remained in a stupor for some minutes till a strange sensation
succeeded the aforesaid perceptions mystifying her intelligence and
leaving her physically almost inert With his personal disappearance
the last three days of her life with him seemed to be swallowed up also
his image in her minds eye waned curiously receded far away grew
stranger and stranger less and less real Their meeting and marriage
had been so sudden unpremeditated adventurous that she could hardly
believe that she had played her part in such a reckless drama Of all
the few hours of her life with Charles the portion that most insisted in
coming back to memory was their fortuitous encounter on the previous
Saturday and those bitter reprimands with which he had begun the attack
as it might be called which had piqued her to an unexpected
consummation

A sort of cruelty an imperiousness even in his warmth had
characterized Charles Stow As a lover he had ever been a bit of a
tyrant and it might pretty truly have been said that he had stung her
into marriage with him at last Still more alien from her life did these
reflections operate to make him and then they would be chased away by an
interval of passionate weeping and mad regret Finally there returned
upon the confused mind of the young wife the recollection that she was on
her way homeward and that the packet would sail in threequarters of an
hour

Except the parasol in her hand all she possessed was at the station
awaiting her onward journey

She looked in that direction and entering one of those undemonstrative
phases so common with her walked quietly on

At first she made straight for the railway but suddenly turning she went
to a shop and wrote an anonymous line announcing his death by drowning to
the only person she had ever heard Charles mention as a relative Posting
this stealthily and with a fearful look around her she seemed to
acquire a terror of the late events pursuing her way to the station as
if followed by a spectre

When she got to the office she asked for the luggage that she had left
there on the Saturday as well as the trunk left on the morning just
lapsed All were put in the boat and she herself followed Quickly as
these things had been done the whole proceeding nevertheless had been
almost automatic on Baptistas part ere she had come to any definite
conclusion on her course

Just before the bell rang she heard a conversation on the pier which
removed the last shade of doubt from her mind if any had existed that
she was Charles Stows widow The sentences were but fragmentary but
she could easily piece them out

A man drownedswam out too farwas a stranger to the placepeople in
boatsaw him go downcouldnt get there in time

The news was little more definite than this as yet though it may as well
be stated once for all that the statement was true Charley with the
overconfidence of his nature had ventured out too far for his strength
and succumbed in the absence of assistance his lifeless body being at
that moment suspended in the transparent middepths of the bay His
clothes however had merely been gently lifted by the rising tide and
floated into a nook hard by where they lay out of sight of the passers
by till a day or two after



CHAPTER IV


In ten minutes they were steaming out of the harbour for their voyage of
four or five hours at whose ending she would have to tell her strange
story

As Penzephyr and all its environing scenes disappeared behind Mousehole
and St Clements Isle Baptistas ephemeral meteorlike husband
impressed her yet more as a fantasy She was still in such a trancelike
state that she had been an hour on the little packetboat before she
became aware of the agitating fact that Mr Heddegan was on board with
her Involuntarily she slipped from her left hand the symbol of her
wifehood

Heehee Well the truth is I wouldnt interrupt ee I reckon she
dont see me or wont see me I said and whats the hurry Shell
see enough o me soon I hope ye be well mee deer

He was a hale wellconditioned man of about five and fifty of the
complexion common to those whose lives are passed on the bluffs and
beaches of an ocean isle He extended the four quarters of his face in a
genial smile and his hand for a grasp of the same magnitude She gave
her own in surprised docility and he continued I couldnt help coming
across to meet ee What an unfortunate thing you missing the boat and
not coming Saturday They meant to have warned ee that the time was
changed but forgot it at the last moment The truth is that I should
have informed ee myself but I was that busy finishing up a job last
week so as to have this week free that I trusted to your father for
attending to these little things However so plain and quiet as it is
all to be it really do not matter so much as it might otherwise have
done and I hope ye havent been greatly put out Now if youd sooner
that I should not be seen talking to eeif ee feel shy at all before
strangersjust say Ill leave ee to yourself till we get home

Thank you much I am indeed a little tired Mr Heddegan

He nodded urbane acquiescence strolled away immediately and minutely
inspected the surface of the funnel till some female passengers of
Giants Town tittered at what they must have thought a rebufffor the
approaching wedding was known to many on St Marias Island though to
nobody elsewhere Baptista coloured at their satire and called him
back and forced herself to commune with him in at least a mechanically
friendly manner

The opening event had been thus different from her expectation and she
had adumbrated no act to meet it Taken aback she passively allowed
circumstances to pilot her along and so the voyage was made

It was near dusk when they touched the pier of Giants Town where
several friends and neighbours stood awaiting them Her father had a
lantern in his hand Her mother too was there reproachfully glad that
the delay had at last ended so simply Mrs Trewthen and her daughter
went together along the Giants Walk or promenade to the house rather
in advance of her husband and Mr Heddegan who talked in loud tones
which reached the women over their shoulders

Some would have called Mrs Trewthen a good mother but though well
meaning she was maladroit and her intentions missed their mark This
might have been partly attributable to the slight deafness from which she
suffered Now as usual the chief utterances came from her lips

Ah yes Im so glad my child that youve got over safe It is all
ready and everything so well arranged that nothing but misfortune could
hinder you settling as with Gods grace becomes ee Close to your
mothers door amost twill be a great blessing Im sure and I was
very glad to find from your letters that youd held your word sacred
Thats rightmake your word your bond always Mrs Wace seems to be a
sensible woman I hope the Lord will do for her as hes doing for you no
long time hence And how did ee get over the terrible journey from Tor
uponSea to Penzephyr Once youd done with the railway of course you
seemed quite at home Well Baptista conduct yourself seemly and all
will be well

Thus admonished Baptista entered the house her father and Mr Heddegan
immediately at her back Her mother had been so didactic that she had
felt herself absolutely unable to broach the subjects in the centre of
her mind

The familiar room with the dark ceiling the wellspread table the old
chairs had never before spoken so eloquently of the times ere she knew
or had heard of Charley Stow She went upstairs to take off her things
her mother remaining below to complete the disposition of the supper and
attend to the preparation of tomorrows meal altogether composing such
an array of pies from pies of fish to pies of turnips as was never
heard of outside the Western Duchy Baptista once alone sat down and
did nothing and was called before she had taken off her bonnet

Im coming she cried jumping up and speedily disapparelling herself
brushed her hair with a few touches and went down

Two or three of Mr Heddegans and her fathers friends had dropped in
and expressed their sympathy for the delay she had been subjected to The
meal was a most merry one except to Baptista She had desired privacy
and there was none and to break the news was already a greater
difficulty than it had been at first Everything around her animate and
inanimate great and small insisted that she had come home to be
married and she could not get a chance to say nay

One or two people sang songs as overtures to the melody of the morrow
till at length bedtime came and they all withdrew her mother having
retired a little earlier When Baptista found herself again alone in her
bedroom the case stood as before she had come home with much to say and
she had said nothing

It was now growing clear even to herself that Charles being dead she had
not determination sufficient within her to break tidings which had he
been alive would have imperatively announced themselves And thus with
the stroke of midnight came the turning of the scale her story should
remain untold It was not that upon the whole she thought it best not to
attempt to tell it but that she could not undertake so explosive a
matter To stop the wedding now would cause a convulsion in Giants Town
little short of volcanic Weakened tired and terrified as she had been
by the days adventures she could not make herself the author of such a
catastrophe But how refuse Heddegan without telling It really seemed
to her as if her marriage with Mr Heddegan were about to take place as
if nothing had intervened

Morning came The events of the previous days were cut off from her
present existence by scene and sentiment more completely than ever
Charles Stow had grown to be a special being of whom owing to his
character she entertained rather fearful than loving memory Baptista
could hear when she awoke that her parents were already moving about
downstairs But she did not rise till her mothers rather rough voice
resounded up the staircase as it had done on the preceding evening

Baptista Come time to be stirring The man will be here by heavens
blessing in threequarters of an hour He has looked in already for a
minute or twoand says hes going to the church to see if things be well
forward

Baptista arose looked out of the window and took the easy course When
she emerged from the regions above she was arrayed in her new silk frock
and best stockings wearing a linen jacket over the former for
breakfasting and her common slippers over the latter not to spoil the
new ones on the rough precincts of the dwelling

It is unnecessary to dwell at any great length on this part of the
mornings proceedings She revealed nothing and married Heddegan as
she had given her word to do on that appointed August day



CHAPTER V


Mr Heddegan forgave the coldness of his brides manner during and after
the wedding ceremony full well aware that there had been considerable
reluctance on her part to acquiesce in this neighbourly arrangement and
as a philosopher of long standing holding that whatever Baptistas
attitude now the conditions would probably be much the same six months
hence as those which ruled among other married couples

An absolutely unexpected shock was given to Baptistas listless mind
about an hour after the wedding service They had nearly finished the
midday dinner when the now husband said to her father We think of
starting about two And the breeze being so fair we shall bring up
inside Penzephyr new pier about six at least

Whatare we going to Penzephyr said Baptista I dont know
anything of it

Didnt you tell her asked her father of Heddegan

It transpired that owing to the delay in her arrival this proposal too
among other things had in the hurry not been mentioned to her except
some time ago as a general suggestion that they would go somewhere
Heddegan had imagined that any trip would be pleasant and one to the
mainland the pleasantest of all

She looked so distressed at the announcement that her husband willingly
offered to give it up though he had not had a holiday off the island for
a whole year Then she pondered on the inconvenience of staying at
Giants Town where all the inhabitants were bonded by the circumstances
of their situation into a sort of family party which permitted and
encouraged on such occasions as these oral criticism that was apt to
disturb the equanimity of newly married girls and would especially worry
Baptista in her strange situation Hence unexpectedly she agreed not
to disorganize her husbands plans for the wedding jaunt and it was
settled that as originally intended they should proceed in a
neighbours sailing boat to the metropolis of the district

In this way they arrived at Penzephyr without difficulty or mishap
Bidding adieu to Jenkin and his man who had sailed them over they
strolled arm in arm off the pier Baptista silent cold and obedient
Heddegan had arranged to take her as far as Plymouth before their return
but to go no further than where they had landed that day Their first
business was to find an inn and in this they had unexpected difficulty
since for some reason or otherpossibly the fine weathermany of the
nearest at hand were full of tourists and commercial travellers He led
her on till he reached a tavern which though comparatively unpretending
stood in as attractive a spot as any in the town and this somewhat to
their surprise after their previous experience they found apparently
empty The considerate old man thinking that Baptista was educated to
artistic notions though he himself was deficient in them had decided
that it was most desirable to have on such an occasion as the present
an apartment with a good view the expression being one he had often
heard in use among tourists and he therefore asked for a favourite room
on the first floor from which a bowwindow protruded for the express
purpose of affording such an outlook

The landlady after some hesitation said she was sorry that particular
apartment was engaged the next one however or any other in the house
was unoccupied

The gentleman who has the best one will give it up tomorrow and then
you can change into it she added as Mr Heddegan hesitated about
taking the adjoining and less commanding one

We shall be gone tomorrow and shant want it he said

Wishing not to lose customers the landlady earnestly continued that
since he was bent on having the best room perhaps the other gentleman
would not object to move at once into the one they despised since
though nothing could be seen from the window the room was equally large

Well if he doesnt care for a view said Mr Heddegan with the air of
a highly artistic man who did

O noI am sure he doesnt she said I can promise that you shall
have the room you want If you would not object to go for a walk for
half an hour I could have it ready and your things in it and a nice
tea laid in the bowwindow by the time you come back

This proposal was deemed satisfactory by the fussy old tradesman and
they went out Baptista nervously conducted him in an opposite direction
to her walk of the former day in other company showing on her wan face
had he observed it how much she was beginning to regret her sacrificial
step for mending matters that morning

She took advantage of a moment when her husbands back was turned to
inquire casually in a shop if anything had been heard of the gentleman
who was sucked down in the eddy while bathing

The shopman said Yes his body has been washed ashore and had just
handed Baptista a newspaper on which she discerned the heading A
Schoolmaster drowned while bathing when her husband turned to join her
She might have pursued the subject without raising suspicion but it was
more than flesh and blood could do and completing a small purchase
almost ran out of the shop

What is your terrible hurry mee deer said Heddegan hastening after

I dont knowI dont want to stay in shops she gasped

And we wont he said They are suffocating this weather Lets go
back and have some tay

They found the much desired apartment awaiting their entry It was a
sort of combination bed and sittingroom and the table was prettily
spread with high tea in the bowwindow a bunch of flowers in the midst
and a bestparlour chair on each side Here they shared the meal by the
ruddy light of the vanishing sun But though the view had been engaged
regardless of expense exclusively for Baptistas pleasure she did not
direct any keen attention out of the window Her gaze as often fell on
the floor and walls of the room as elsewhere and on the table as much as
on either beholding nothing at all

But there was a change Opposite her seat was the door upon which her
eyes presently became riveted like those of a little bird upon a snake
For on a peg at the back of the door there hung a hat such a
hatsurely from its peculiar make the actual hatthat had been worn
by Charles Conviction grew to certainty when she saw a railway ticket
sticking up from the band Charles had put the ticket thereshe had
noticed the act

Her teeth almost chattered she murmured something incoherent Her
husband jumped up and said You are not well What is it What shall I
get ee

Smelling salts she said quickly and desperately at that chemists
shop you were in just now

He jumped up like the anxious old man that he was caught up his own hat
from a back table and without observing the other hastened out and
downstairs

Left alone she gazed and gazed at the back of the door then
spasmodically rang the bell An honestlooking country maidservant
appeared in response

A hat murmured Baptista pointing with her finger It does not
belong to us

O yes Ill take it away said the young woman with some hurry It
belongs to the other gentleman

She spoke with a certain awkwardness and took the hat out of the room
Baptista had recovered her outward composure The other gentleman she
said Where is the other gentleman

Hes in the next room maam He removed out of this to oblige ee

How can you say so I should hear him if he were there said Baptista
sufficiently recovered to argue down an apparent untruth

Hes there said the girl hardily

Then it is strange that he makes no noise said Mrs Heddegan
convicting the girl of falsity by a look

He makes no noise but it is not strange said the servant

All at once a dread took possession of the brides heart like a cold
hand laid thereon for it flashed upon her that there was a possibility
of reconciling the girls statement with her own knowledge of facts

Why does he make no noise she weakly said

The waitingmaid was silent and looked at her questioner If I tell
you maam you wont tell missis she whispered

Baptista promised

Because hes alying dead said the girl Hes the schoolmaster that
was drownded yesterday

O said the bride covering her eyes Then he was in this room till
just now

Yes said the maid thinking the young ladys agitation natural enough
And I told missis that I thought she oughtnt to have done it because I
dont hold it right to keep visitors so much in the dark where deaths
concerned but she said the gentleman didnt die of anything infectious
she was a poor honest innkeepers wife she says who had to get her
living by making hay while the sun sheened And owing to the drownded
gentleman being brought here she said it kept so many people away that
we were empty though all the other houses were full So when your good
man set his mind upon the room and she would have lost good paying folk
if hed not had it it wasnt to be supposed she said that shed let
anything stand in the way Ye wont say that Ive told ye please mm
All the linen has been changed and as the inquest wont be till
tomorrow after you are gone she thought you wouldnt know a word of
it being strangers here

The returning footsteps of her husband broke off further narration
Baptista waved her hand for she could not speak The waitingmaid
quickly withdrew and Mr Heddegan entered with the smelling salts and
other nostrums

Any better he questioned

I dont like the hotel she exclaimed almost simultaneously I cant
bear itit doesnt suit me

Is that all thats the matter he returned pettishly this being the
first time of his showing such a mood Upon my heart and life such
trifling is trying to any mans temper Baptista Sending me about from
here to yond and then when I come back saying ee dont like the place
that I have sunk so much money and words to get for ee Od dang it
all tis enough toBut I wont say any more at present mee deer
though it is just too much to expect to turn out of the house now We
shant get another quiet place at this time of the eveningevery other
inn in the town is bustling with rackety folk of one sort and tother
while here tis as quiet as the gravethe country I would say So bide
still dye hear and tomorrow we shall be out of the town altogetheras
early as you like

The obstinacy of age had in short overmastered its complaisance and
the young woman said no more The simple course of telling him that in
the adjoining room lay a corpse which had lately occupied their own
might it would have seemed have been an effectual one without further
disclosure but to allude to that subject however it was disguised was
more than Heddegans young wife had strength for Horror broke her down
In the contingency one thing only presented itself to her paralyzed
regardthat here she was doomed to abide in a hideous contiguity to the
dead husband and the living and her conjecture did in fact bear itself
out That night she lay between the two men she had marriedHeddegan on
the one hand and on the other through the partition against which the
bed stood Charles Stow



CHAPTER VI


Kindly time had withdrawn the foregoing event three days from the present
of Baptista Heddegan It was ten oclock in the morning she had been
ill not in an ordinary or definite sense but in a state of cold
stupefaction from which it was difficult to arouse her so much as to say
a few sentences When questioned she had replied that she was pretty
well

Their trip as such had been something of a failure They had gone on
as far as Falmouth but here he had given way to her entreaties to return
home This they could not very well do without repassing through Pen
zephyr at which place they had now again arrived

In the train she had seen a weekly local paper and read there a
paragraph detailing the inquest on Charles It was added that the
funeral was to take place at his native town of Redrutin on Friday

After reading this she had shown no reluctance to enter the fatal
neighbourhood of the tragedy only stipulating that they should take
their rest at a different lodging from the first and now comparatively
braced up and calmindeed a cooler creature altogether than when last in
the town she said to David that she wanted to walk out for a while as
they had plenty of time on their hands

To a shop as usual I suppose mee deer

Partly for shopping she said And it will be best for you dear to
stay in after trotting about so much and have a good rest while I am
gone

He assented and Baptista sallied forth As she had stated her first
visit was made to a shop a drapers Without the exercise of much
choice she purchased a black bonnet and veil also a black stuff gown a
black mantle she already wore These articles were made up into a parcel
which in spite of the saleswomans offers her customer said she would
take with her Bearing it on her arm she turned to the railway and at
the station got a ticket for Redrutin

Thus it appeared that on her recovery from the paralyzed mood of the
former day while she had resolved not to blast utterly the happiness of
her present husband by revealing the history of the departed one she had
also determined to indulge a certain odd inconsequent feminine
sentiment of decency to the small extent to which it could do no harm to
any person At Redrutin she emerged from the railway carriage in the
black attire purchased at the shop having during the transit made the
change in the empty compartment she had chosen The other clothes were
now in the bandbox and parcel Leaving these at the cloakroom she
proceeded onward and after a wary survey reached the side of a hill
whence a view of the burial ground could be obtained

It was now a little before two oclock While Baptista waited a funeral
procession ascended the road Baptista hastened across and by the time
the procession entered the cemetery gates she had unobtrusively joined
it

In addition to the schoolmasters own relatives not a few the
paragraph in the newspapers of his death by drowning had drawn together
many neighbours acquaintances and onlookers Among them she passed
unnoticed and with a quiet step pursued the winding path to the chapel
and afterwards thence to the grave When all was over and the relatives
and idlers had withdrawn she stepped to the edge of the chasm From
beneath her mantle she drew a little bunch of forgetmenots and dropped
them in upon the coffin In a few minutes she also turned and went away
from the cemetery By five oclock she was again in Penzephyr

You have been a mortal long time said her husband crossly I
allowed you an hour at most mee deer

It occupied me longer said she

WellI reckon it is wasting words to complain Hang it ye look so
tired and wisht that I cant find heart to say what I would

I amweary and wisht David I am We can get home tomorrow for
certain I hope

We can And please God we will said Mr Heddegan heartily as if he
too were weary of his brief honeymoon I must be into business again on
Monday morning at latest

They left by the next morning steamer and in the afternoon took up their
residence in their own house at Giants Town

The hour that she reached the island it was as if a material weight had
been removed from Baptistas shoulders Her husband attributed the
change to the influence of the local breezes after the hothouse
atmosphere of the mainland However that might be settled here a few
doors from her mothers dwelling she recovered in no very long time much
of her customary bearing which was never very demonstrative She
accepted her position calmly and faintly smiled when her neighbours
learned to call her Mrs Heddegan and said she seemed likely to become
the leader of fashion in Giants Town

Her husband was a man who had made considerably more money by trade than
her father had done and perhaps the greater profusion of surroundings at
her command than she had heretofore been mistress of was not without an
effect upon her One week two weeks three weeks passed and being pre
eminently a young woman who allowed things to drift she did nothing
whatever either to disclose or conceal traces of her first marriage or
to learn if there existed possibilitieswhich there undoubtedly didby
which that hasty contract might become revealed to those about her at any
unexpected moment

While yet within the first month of her marriage and on an evening just
before sunset Baptista was standing within her garden adjoining the
house when she saw passing along the road a personage clad in a greasy
black coat and battered tall hat which common enough in the slums of a
city had an odd appearance in St Marias The tramp as he seemed to
be marked her at oncebonnetless and unwrapped as she was her features
were plainly recognizableand with an air of friendly surprise came and
leant over the wall

What dont you know me said he

She had some dim recollection of his face but said that she was not
acquainted with him

Why your witness to be sure maam Dont you mind the man that was
mending the churchwindow when you and your intended husband walked up to
be made one and the clerk called me down from the ladder and I came and
did my part by writing my name and occupation

Baptista glanced quickly around her husband was out of earshot That
would have been of less importance but for the fact that the wedding
witnessed by this personage had not been the wedding with Mr Heddegan
but the one on the day previous

Ive had a misfortune since then thats pulled me under continued her
friend But dont let me damp yer wedded joy by naming the particulars
Yes Ive seen changes since though tis but a short time agolet me
see only a month next week I think for twere the first or second day
in August

Yesthats when it was said another man a sailor who had come up
with a pipe in his mouth and felt it necessary to join in Baptista
having receded to escape further speech For that was the first time I
set foot in Giants Town and her husband took her to him the same day

A dialogue then proceeded between the two men outside the wall which
Baptista could not help hearing

Ay I signed the book that made her one flesh repeated the decayed
glazier Wheres her goodman

About the premises somewhere but you dont see em together much
replied the sailor in an undertone You see hes older than she

Older I should never have thought it from my own observation said
the glazier He was a remarkably handsome man

Handsome Well there he iswe can see for ourselves

David Heddegan had indeed just shown himself at the upper end of the
garden and the glazier looking in bewilderment from the husband to the
wife saw the latter turn pale

Now that decayed glazier was a farseeing and cunning mantoo farseeing
and cunning to allow himself to thrive by simple and straightforward
meansand he held his peace till he could read more plainly the meaning
of this riddle merely adding carelessly Wellmarriage do alter a man
tis true I should never ha knowed him

He then stared oddly at the disconcerted Baptista and moving on to where
he could again address her asked her to do him a good turn since he
once had done the same for her Understanding that he meant money she
handed him some at which he thanked her and instantly went away



CHAPTER VII


She had escaped exposure on this occasion but the incident had been an
awkward one and should have suggested to Baptista that sooner or later
the secret must leak out As it was she suspected that at any rate she
had not heard the last of the glazier

In a day or two when her husband had gone to the old town on the other
side of the island there came a gentle tap at the door and the worthy
witness of her first marriage made his appearance a second time

It took me hours to get to the bottom of the mysteryhours he said
with a gaze of deep confederacy which offended her pride very deeply
But thanks to a good intellect Ive done it Now maam Im not a man
to tell tales even when a tale would be so good as this But Im going
back to the mainland again and a little assistance would be as rain on
thirsty ground

I helped you two days ago began Baptista

Yesbut what was that my good lady Not enough to pay my passage to
Penzephyr I came over on your account for I thought there was a
mystery somewhere Now I must go back on my own Mind thistwould be
very awkward for you if your old man were to know Hes a queer temper
though he may be fond

She knew as well as her visitor how awkward it would be and the hush
money she paid was heavy that day She had however the satisfaction of
watching the man to the steamer and seeing him diminish out of sight
But Baptista perceived that the system into which she had been led of
purchasing silence thus was one fatal to her peace of mind particularly
if it had to be continued

Hearing no more from the glazier she hoped the difficulty was past But
another week only had gone by when as she was pacing the Giants Walk
the name given to the promenade she met the same personage in the
company of a fat woman carrying a bundle

This is the lady my dear he said to his companion This maam is
my wife Weve come to settle in the town for a time if so be we can
find room

That you wont do said she Nobody can live here who is not
privileged

I am privileged said the glazier by my trade

Baptista went on but in the afternoon she received a visit from the
mans wife This honest woman began to depict in forcible colours the
necessity for keeping up the concealment

I will intercede with my husband maam she said Hes a true man if
rightly managed and Ill beg him to consider your position Tis a very
nice house youve got here she added glancing round and well worth a
little sacrifice to keep it

The unlucky Baptista staved off the danger on this third occasion as she
had done on the previous two But she formed a resolve that if the
attack were once more to be repeated she would face a revelationworse
though that must now be than before she had attempted to purchase silence
by bribes Her tormentors never believing her capable of acting upon
such an intention came again but she shut the door in their faces They
retreated muttering something but she went to the back of the house
where David Heddegan was

She looked at him unconscious of all The case was serious she knew
that well and all the more serious in that she liked him better now than
she had done at first Yet as she herself began to see the secret was
one that was sure to disclose itself Her name and Charless stood
indelibly written in the registers and though a month only had passed as
yet it was a wonder that his clandestine union with her had not already
been discovered by his friends Thus spurring herself to the inevitable
she spoke to Heddegan

David come indoors I have something to tell you

He hardly regarded her at first She had discerned that during the last
week or two he had seemed preoccupied as if some private business
harassed him She repeated her request He replied with a sigh Yes
certainly mee deer

When they had reached the sittingroom and shut the door she repeated
faintly David I have something to tell youa sort of tragedy I have
concealed You will hate me for having so far deceived you but perhaps
my telling you voluntarily will make you think a little better of me than
you would do otherwise

Tragedy he said awakening to interest Much you can know about
tragedies mee deer that have been in the world so short a time

She saw that he suspected nothing and it made her task the harder But
on she went steadily It is about something that happened before we
were married she said

Indeed

Not a very long time beforea short time And it is about a lover
she faltered

I dont much mind that he said mildly In truth I was in hopes
twas more

In hopes

Well yes

This screwed her up to the necessary effort I met my old sweetheart
He scorned me chid me dared me and I went and married him We were
coming straight here to tell you all what we had done but he was
drowned and I thought I would say nothing about him and I married you
David for the sake of peace and quietness Ive tried to keep it from
you but have found I cannot Therethats the substance of it and you
can never never forgive me I am sure

She spoke desperately But the old man instead of turning black or
blue or slaying her in his indignation jumped up from his chair and
began to caper around the room in quite an ecstatic emotion

O happy thing How well it falls out he exclaimed snapping his
fingers over his head Hahathe knot is cutI see a way out of my
troublehaha She looked at him without uttering a sound till as he
still continued smiling joyfully she said Owhat do you mean Is it
done to torment me

Nono O mee deer your story helps me out of the most heartaching
quandary a poor man ever found himself in You see it is thisIve got
a tragedy too and unless you had had one to tell I could never have
seen my way to tell mine

What is yourswhat is it she asked with altogether a new view of
things

Wellit is a bouncer mine is a bouncer said he looking on the
ground and wiping his eyes

Not worse than mine

Wellthat depends upon how you look at it Yours had to do with the
past alone and I dont mind it You see weve been married a month
and it dont jar upon me as it would if wed only been married a day or
two Now mine refers to past present and future so that

Past present and future she murmured It never occurred to me that
you had a tragedy too

But I have he said shaking his head In fact four

Then tell em cried the young woman

I willI will But be considerate I beg ee mee deer WellI
wasnt a bachelor when I married ee any more than you were a spinster
Just as you was a widowwoman I was a widowman

Ah said she with some surprise But is that allthen we are
nicely balanced she added relieved

Noit is not all Theres the point I am not only a widower

O David

I am a widower with four tragediesthat is to say four strapping
girlsthe eldest taller than you Dont ee look so struckdumblike
It fell out in this way I knew the poor woman their mother in Pen
zephyr for some years andto cut a long story shortI privately
married her at last just before she died I kept the matter secret but
it is getting known among the people here by degrees Ive long felt for
the childrenthat it is my duty to have them here and do something for
them I have not had courage to break it to ee but Ive seen lately
that it would soon come to your ears and that hev worried me

Are they educated said the exschoolmistress

No I am sorry to say they have been much neglected in truth they can
hardly read And so I thought that by marrying a young schoolmistress I
should get some one in the house who could teach em and bring em into
genteel condition all for nothing You see they are growed up too tall
to be sent to school

O mercy she almost moaned Four great girls to teach the rudiments
to and have always in the house with me spelling over their books and I
hate teaching it kills me I am bitterly punishedI am I am

Youll get used to em mee deer and the balance of secretsmine
against yourswill comfort your heart with a sense of justice I could
send for em this week very welland I will In faith I could send
this very day Baptista you have relieved me of all my difficulty

Thus the interview ended so far as this matter was concerned Baptista
was too stupefied to say more and when she went away to her room she
wept from very mortification at Mr Heddegans duplicity Education the
one thing she abhorred the shame of it to delude a young wife so

The next meal came round As they sat Baptista would not suffer her
eyes to turn towards him He did not attempt to intrude upon her
reserve but every now and then looked under the table and chuckled with
satisfaction at the aspect of affairs How very well matched we be he
said comfortably

Next day when the steamer came in Baptista saw her husband rush down to
meet it and soon after there appeared at her door four tall hipless
shoulderless girls dwindling in height and size from the eldest to the
youngest like a row of Pan pipes at the head of them standing Heddegan
He smiled pleasantly through the grey fringe of his whiskers and beard
and turning to the girls said Now come forrard and shake hands
properly with your stepmother

Thus she made their acquaintance and he went out leaving them together
On examination the poor girls turned out to be not only plainlooking
which she could have forgiven but to have such a lamentably meagre
intellectual equipment as to be hopelessly inadequate as companions Even
the eldest almost her own age could only read with difficulty words of
two syllables and taste in dress was beyond their comprehension In the
long vista of future years she saw nothing but dreary drudgery at her
detested old trade without prospect of reward

She went about quite despairing during the next few daysan unpromising
unfortunate mood for a woman who had not been married six weeks From
her parents she concealed everything They had been amongst the few
acquaintances of Heddegan who knew nothing of his secret and were
indignant enough when they saw such a readymade household foisted upon
their only child But she would not support them in their remonstrances

No you dont yet know all she said

Thus Baptista had sense enough to see the retributive fairness of this
issue For some time whenever conversation arose between her and
Heddegan which was not often she always said I am miserable and you
know it Yet I dont wish things to be otherwise

But one day when he asked How do you like em now her answer was
unexpected Much better than I did she said quietly I may like
them very much some day

This was the beginning of a serener season for the chastened spirit of
Baptista Heddegan She had in truth discovered underneath the crust
of uncouthness and meagre articulation which was due to their
Troglodytean existence that her unwelcomed daughters had natures that
were unselfish almost to sublimity The harsh discipline accorded to
their young lives before their mothers wrong had been righted had
operated less to crush them than to lift them above all personal
ambition They considered the world and its contents in a purely
objective way and their own lot seemed only to affect them as that of
certain human beings among the rest whose troubles they knew rather than
suffered

This was such an entirely new way of regarding life to a woman of
Baptistas nature that her attention from being first arrested by it
became deeply interested By imperceptible pulses her heart expanded in
sympathy with theirs The sentences of her tragicomedy her life
confused till now became clearer daily That in humanity as
exemplified by these girls there was nothing to dislike but infinitely
much to pity she learnt with the lapse of each week in their company
She grew to like the girls of unpromising exterior and from liking she
got to love them till they formed an unexpected point of junction
between her own and her husbands interests generating a sterling
friendship at least between a pair in whose existence there had
threatened to be neither friendship nor love
