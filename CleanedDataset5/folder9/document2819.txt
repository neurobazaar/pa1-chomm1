 Dedication

 To T A
 I have made for you a song
 And it may be right or wrong
 But only you can tell me if its true
 I have tried for to explain
 Both your pleasure and your pain
 And Thomas heres my best respects to you

 O therell surely come a day
 When theyll give you all your pay
 And treat you as a Christian ought to do
 So until that day comes round
 Heaven keep you safe and sound
 And Thomas heres my best respects to you

Danny Deever

 What are the bugles blowin for said FilesonParade
 To turn you out to turn you out the ColourSergeant said
 What makes you look so white so white said FilesonParade
 Im dreadin what Ive got to watch the ColourSergeant said
 For theyre hangin Danny Deever you can hear the Dead March play
 The regiments in ollow squaretheyre hangin him today
 Theyve taken of his buttons off an cut his stripes away
 An theyre hangin Danny Deever in the mornin

 What makes the rearrank breathe so ard said FilesonParade
 Its bitter cold its bitter cold the ColourSergeant said
 What makes that frontrank man fall down said FilesonParade
 A touch o sun a touch o sun the ColourSergeant said
 They are hangin Danny Deever they are marchin of im round
 They ave alted Danny Deever by is coffin on the ground
 An ell swing in arf a minute for a sneakin shootin hound
 O theyre hangin Danny Deever in the mornin

 Is cot was rightand cot to mine said FilesonParade
 Es sleepin out an far tonight the ColourSergeant said
 Ive drunk is beer a score o times said FilesonParade
 Es drinkin bitter beer alone the ColourSergeant said
 They are hangin Danny Deever you must mark im to is place
 For e shot a comrade sleepinyou must look im in the face
 Nine undred of is county an the regiments disgrace
 While theyre hangin Danny Deever in the mornin

 Whats that so black agin the sun said FilesonParade
 Its Danny fightin ard for life the ColourSergeant said
 Whats that that whimpers overead said FilesonParade
 Its Dannys soul thats passin now the ColourSergeant said
 For theyre done with Danny Deever you can ear the quickstep play
 The regiments in column an theyre marchin us away
 Ho the young recruits are shakin an theyll want their beer today
 After hangin Danny Deever in the mornin




Tommy

 I went into a publicouse to get a pint o beer
 The publican e up an sez We serve no redcoats here
 The girls beind the bar they laughed an giggled fit to die
 I outs into the street again an to myself sez I
 O its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy go away
 But its Thank you Mister Atkins when the band begins to play
 The band begins to play my boys the band begins to play
 O its Thank you Mister Atkins when the band begins to play

 I went into a theatre as sober as could be
 They gave a drunk civilian room but adnt none for me
 They sent me to the gallery or round the musicalls
 But when it comes to fightin Lord theyll shove me in the stalls
 For its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy wait outside
 But its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide
 The troopships on the tide my boys the troopships on the tide
 O its Special train for Atkins when the troopers on the tide

 Yes makin mock o uniforms that guard you while you sleep
 Is cheaper than them uniforms an theyre starvation cheap
 An hustlin drunken soldiers when theyre goin large a bit
 Is five times better business than paradin in full kit
 Then its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy ows yer soul
 But its Thin red line of eroes when the drums begin to roll
 The drums begin to roll my boys the drums begin to roll
 O its Thin red line of eroes when the drums begin to roll

 We arent no thin red eroes nor we arent no blackguards too
 But single men in barricks most remarkable like you
 An if sometimes our conduck isnt all your fancy paints
 Why single men in barricks dont grow into plaster saints
 While its Tommy this an Tommy that an Tommy fall beind
 But its Please to walk in front sir when theres trouble in the wind
 Theres trouble in the wind my boys theres trouble in the wind
 O its Please to walk in front sir when theres trouble in the wind

 You talk o better food for us an schools an fires an all
 Well wait for extry rations if you treat us rational
 Dont mess about the cookroom slops but prove it to our face
 The Widows Uniform is not the soldiermans disgrace
 For its Tommy this an Tommy that an Chuck him out the brute
 But its Saviour of is country when the guns begin to shoot
 An its Tommy this an Tommy that an anything you please
 An Tommy aint a bloomin foolyou bet that Tommy sees




FuzzyWuzzy

 Soudan Expeditionary Force


 Weve fought with many men acrost the seas
 An some of em was brave an some was not
 The Paythan an the Zulu an Burmese
 But the Fuzzy was the finest o the lot
 We never got a haporths change of im
 E squatted in the scrub an ocked our orses
 E cut our sentries up at Suakim
 An e played the cat an banjo with our forces
 So eres to you FuzzyWuzzy at your ome in the Soudan
 Youre a pore benighted eathen but a firstclass fightin man
 We gives you your certificate an if you want it signed
 Well come an ave a romp with you whenever youre inclined

 We took our chanst among the Khyber ills
 The Boers knocked us silly at a mile
 The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills
 An a Zulu impi dished us up in style
 But all we ever got from such as they
 Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller
 We eld our bloomin own the papers say
 But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us oller
 Then eres to you FuzzyWuzzy an the missis and the kid
 Our orders was to break you an of course we went an did
 We sloshed you with Martinis an it wasnt ardly fair
 But for all the odds agin you FuzzyWuz you broke the square

 E asnt got no papers of is own
 E asnt got no medals nor rewards
 So we must certify the skill es shown
 In usin of is long twoanded swords
 When es oppin in an out among the bush
 With is coffineaded shield an shovelspear
 An appy day with Fuzzy on the rush
 Will last an ealthy Tommy for a year
 So eres to you FuzzyWuzzy an your friends which are no more
 If we adnt lost some messmates we would elp you to deplore
 But give an takes the gospel an well call the bargain fair
 For if you ave lost more than us you crumpled up the square

 E rushes at the smoke when we let drive
 An before we know es ackin at our ead
 Es all ot sand an ginger when alive
 An es generally shammin when es dead
 Es a daisy es a ducky es a lamb
 Es a injiarubber idiot on the spree
 Es the ony thing that doesnt give a damn
 For a Regiment o British Infantree
 So eres to you FuzzyWuzzy at your ome in the Soudan
 Youre a pore benighted eathen but a firstclass fightin man
 An eres to you FuzzyWuzzy with your ayrick ead of air
 You big black boundin beggarfor you broke a British square

ScrewGuns

 Smokin my pipe on the mountings sniffin the mornin cool
 I walks in my old brown gaiters along o my old brown mule
 With seventy gunners beind me an never a beggar forgets
 Its only the pick of the Army
 that handles the dear little petsTss Tss
 For you all love the screwgunsthe screwguns they all love you
 So when we call round with a few guns
 o course you will know what to dohoo hoo
 Jest send in your Chief an surrender
 its worse if you fights or you runs
 You can go where you please you can skid up the trees
 but you dont get away from the guns

 They sends us along where the roads are but mostly we goes where they aint
 Wed climb up the side of a signboard an trust to the stick o the paint
 Weve chivied the Naga an Looshai weve give the Afreedeeman fits
 For we fancies ourselves at two thousand
 we guns that are built in two bitsTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 If a man doesnt work why we drills im an teaches im ow to behave
 If a beggar cant march why we kills im an rattles im into is grave
 Youve got to stand up to our business an spring without snatchin or fuss
 Dyou say that you sweat with the fieldguns
 By God you must lather with usTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 The eagles is screamin around us the rivers amoanin below
 Were clear o the pine an the oakscrub
 were out on the rocks an the snow
 An the wind is as thin as a whiplash what carries away to the plains
 The rattle an stamp o the leadmules
 the jingletyjink o the chainsTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 Theres a wheel on the Horns o the Mornin
 an a wheel on the edge o the Pit
 An a drop into nothin beneath you as straight as a beggar can spit
 With the sweat runnin out o your shirtsleeves
 an the sun off the snow in your face
 An arf o the men on the dragropes
 to hold the old gun in er placeTss Tss
 For you all love the screwguns

 Smokin my pipe on the mountings sniffin the mornin cool
 I climbs in my old brown gaiters along o my old brown mule
 The monkey can say what our road was
 the wildgoat e knows where we passed
 Stand easy you longeared old darlins
 Out dragropes With shrapnel Hold fastTss Tss
 For you all love the screwgunsthe screwguns they all love you
 So when we take tea with a few guns
 o course you will know what to dohoo hoo
 Jest send in your Chief an surrender
 its worse if you fights or you runs
 You may hide in the caves theyll be only your graves
 but you cant get away from the guns




Cells

 Ive a head like a concertina Ive a tongue like a buttonstick
 Ive a mouth like an old potato and Im more than a little sick
 But Ive had my fun o the Corprals Guard Ive made the cinders fly
 And Im here in the Clink for a thundering drink
 and blacking the Corporals eye
 With a secondhand overcoat under my head
 And a beautiful view of the yard
 O its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard
 Mad drunk and resisting the Guard
 Strewth but I socked it them hard
 So its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard

 I started o canteen porter I finished o canteen beer
 But a dose o gin that a mate slipped in it was that that brought me here
 Twas that and an extry double Guard that rubbed my nose in the dirt
 But I fell away with the Corprals stock
 and the best of the Corprals shirt

 I left my cap in a publichouse my boots in the public road
 And Lord knows where and I dont care my belt and my tunic goed
 Theyll stop my pay theyll cut away the stripes I used to wear
 But I left my mark on the Corprals face and I think hell keep it there

 My wife she cries on the barrackgate my kid in the barrackyard
 It aint that I mind the Ordly roomits that that cuts so hard
 Ill take my oath before them both that I will sure abstain
 But as soon as Im in with a mate and gin I know Ill do it again
 With a secondhand overcoat under my head
 And a beautiful view of the yard
 Yes its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard
 Mad drunk and resisting the Guard
 Strewth but I socked it them hard
 So its packdrill for me and a fortnights CB
 For drunk and resisting the Guard




Gunga Din

 You may talk o gin and beer
 When youre quartered safe out ere
 An youre sent to pennyfights an Aldershot it
 But when it comes to slaughter
 You will do your work on water
 An youll lick the bloomin boots of im thats got it
 Now in Injias sunny clime
 Where I used to spend my time
 Aservin of Er Majesty the Queen
 Of all them blackfaced crew
 The finest man I knew
 Was our regimental bhisti Gunga Din
 He was Din Din Din
 You limpin lump o brickdust Gunga Din
 Hi slippery hitherao
 Water get it Panee lao
 You squidgynosed old idol Gunga Din

 The uniform e wore
 Was nothin much before
 An rather less than arf o that beind
 For a piece o twisty rag
 An a goatskin waterbag
 Was all the fieldequipment e could find
 When the sweatin trooptrain lay
 In a sidin through the day
 Where the eat would make your bloomin eyebrows crawl
 We shouted Harry By
 Till our throats were brickydry
 Then we wopped im cause e couldnt serve us all
 It was Din Din Din
 You eathen where the mischief ave you been
 You put some juldee in it
 Or Ill marrow you this minute
 If you dont fill up my helmet Gunga Din

 E would dot an carry one
 Till the longest day was done
 An e didnt seem to know the use o fear
 If we charged or broke or cut
 You could bet your bloomin nut
 Ed be waitin fifty paces right flank rear
 With is mussick on is back
 E would skip with our attack
 An watch us till the bugles made Retire
 An for all is dirty ide
 E was white clear white inside
 When e went to tend the wounded under fire
 It was Din Din Din
 With the bullets kickin dustspots on the green
 When the cartridges ran out
 You could hear the frontfiles shout
 Hi ammunitionmules an Gunga Din

 I shant forgit the night
 When I dropped beind the fight
 With a bullet where my beltplate should a been
 I was chokin mad with thirst
 An the man that spied me first
 Was our good old grinnin gruntin Gunga Din
 E lifted up my ead
 An he plugged me where I bled
 An e guv me arfapint o watergreen
 It was crawlin and it stunk
 But of all the drinks Ive drunk
 Im gratefullest to one from Gunga Din
 It was Din Din Din
 Eres a beggar with a bullet through is spleen
 Es chawin up the ground
 An es kickin all around
 For Gawds sake git the water Gunga Din

 E carried me away
 To where a dooli lay
 An a bullet come an drilled the beggar clean
 E put me safe inside
 An just before e died
 I ope you liked your drink sez Gunga Din
 So Ill meet im later on
 At the place where e is gone
 Where its always double drill and no canteen
 Ell be squattin on the coals
 Givin drink to poor damned souls
 An Ill get a swig in hell from Gunga Din
 Yes Din Din Din
 You Lazarushianleather Gunga Din
 Though Ive belted you and flayed you
 By the livin Gawd that made you
 Youre a better man than I am Gunga Din




Oonts

 Northern India Transport Train

 Wot makes the soldiers eart to penk wot makes im to perspire
 It isnt standin up to charge nor lyin down to fire
 But its everlastin waitin on a everlastin road
 For the commissariat camel an is commissariat load
 O the oont O the oont O the commissariat oont
 With is silly neck abobbin like a basket full o snakes
 We packs im like an idol an you ought to ear im grunt
 An when we gets im loaded up is blessed girthrope breaks

 Wot makes the rearguard swear so ard when night is drorin in
 An every native follower is shiverin for is skin
 It aint the chanst o being rushed by Paythans from the ills
 Its the commissariat camel puttin on is bloomin frills
 O the oont O the oont O the hairy scary oont
 Atrippin over tentropes when weve got the night alarm
 We socks im with a stretcherpole an eads im off in front
 An when weve saved is bloomin life e chaws our bloomin arm

 The orse e knows above a bit the bullocks but a fool
 The elephants a gentleman the batterymules a mule
 But the commissariat camuel when all is said an done
 Es a devil an a ostrich an a orphanchild in one
 O the oont O the oont O the Gawdforsaken oont
 The lumpyumpy umminbird asingin where e lies
 Es blocked the whole division from the rearguard to the front
 An when we get him up againthe beggar goes an dies

 Ell gall an chafe an lame an fighte smells most awful vile
 Ell lose isself for ever if you let im stray a mile
 Es game to graze the ole day long an owl the ole night through
 An when e comes to greasy ground e splits isself in two
 O the oont O the oont O the floppin droppin oont
 When is long legs give from under an is meltin eye is dim
 The tribes is up beind us and the tribes is out in front
 It aint no jam for Tommy but its kites an crows for im

 So when the cruel march is done an when the roads is blind
 An when we sees the camp in front an ears the shots beind
 Ho then we strips is saddle off and all is woes is past
 E thinks on us that used im so and gets revenge at last
 O the oont O the oont O the floatin bloatin oont
 The late lamented camel in the watercut e lies
 We keeps a mile beind im an we keeps a mile in front
 But e gets into the drinkincasks and then o course we dies




Loot

 If youve ever stole a pheasantegg beind the keepers back
 If youve ever snigged the washin from the line
 If youve ever crammed a gander in your bloomin aversack
 You will understand this little song o mine
 But the service rules are ard an from such we are debarred
 For the same with English morals does not suit
 Cornet Toot toot
 Wy they call a man a robber if e stuffs is marchin clobber
 With the
 Chorus Loo loo Lulu lulu Loo loo Loot loot loot
 Ow the loot
 Bloomin loot
 Thats the thing to make the boys git up an shoot
 Its the same with dogs an men
 If youd make em come again
 Clap em forward with a Loo loo Lulu Loot
 ff Whoopee Tear im puppy Loo loo Lulu Loot loot loot

 If youve knocked a nigger edgeways when es thrustin for your life
 You must leave im very careful where e fell
 An may thank your stars an gaiters if you didnt feel is knife
 That you aint told off to bury im as well
 Then the sweatin Tommies wonder as they spade the beggars under
 Why lootin should be entered as a crime
 So if my song youll ear I will learn you plain an clear
 Ow to pay yourself for fightin overtime
 Chorus With the loot

 Now remember when youre acking round a gilded Burma god
 That is eyes is very often precious stones
 An if you treat a nigger to a dose o cleaninrod
 Es like to show you everything e owns
 When e wont prodooce no more pour some water on the floor
 Where you ear it answer ollow to the boot
 Cornet Toot toot
 When the ground begins to sink shove your baynick down the chink
 An youre sure to touch the
 Chorus Loo loo Lulu Loot loot loot
 Ow the loot

 When from ouse to ouse youre unting you must always work in pairs
 It alves the gain but safer you will find
 For a single man gets bottled on them twistywisty stairs
 An a woman comes and clobs im from beind
 When youve turned em inside out an it seems beyond a doubt
 As if there werent enough to dust a flute
 Cornet Toot toot
 Before you sling your ook at the ousetops take a look
 For its underneath the tiles they ide the loot
 Chorus Ow the loot

 You can mostly square a Sergint an a Quartermaster too
 If you only take the proper way to go
 I could never keep my pickins but Ive learned you all I knew
 An dont you never say I told you so
 An now Ill bid goodbye for Im gettin rather dry
 An I see another tunin up to toot
 Cornet Toot toot
 So eres goodluck to those that wears the Widows cloes
 An the Devil send em all they want o loot
 Chorus Yes the loot
 Bloomin loot
 In the tunic an the messtin an the boot
 Its the same with dogs an men
 If youd make em come again
 fff Whoop em forward with a Loo loo Lulu Loot loot loot
 Heeya Sick im puppy Loo loo Lulu Loot loot loot




Snarleyow

 This appened in a battle to a battry of the corps
 Which is first among the women an amazin first in war
 An what the bloomin battle was I dont remember now
 But Twos offlead e answered to the name o Snarleyow
 Down in the Infantry nobody cares
 Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
 But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
 Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

 They was movin into action they was needed very sore
 To learn a little schoolin to a native army corps
 They ad nipped against an uphill they was tuckin down the brow
 When a tricky trundlin roundshot give the knock to Snarleyow

 They cut im loose an left ime was almost tore in two
 But he tried to follow after as a welltrained orse should do
 E went an fouled the limber an the Drivers Brother squeals
 Pull up pull up for Snarleyowis heads between is eels

 The Driver umped is shoulder for the wheels was goin round
 An there aint no Stop conductor when a battrys changin ground
 Sez e I broke the beggar in an very sad I feels
 But I couldnt pull up not for youyour ead between your eels

 E adnt ardly spoke the word before a droppin shell
 A little right the battry an between the sections fell
 An when the smoke ad cleared away before the limber wheels
 There lay the Drivers Brother with is ead between is eels

 Then sez the Drivers Brother an is words was very plain
 For Gawds own sake get over me an put me out o pain
 They saw is wounds was mortial an they judged that it was best
 So they took an drove the limber straight across is back an chest

 The Driver e give nothin cept a little coughin grunt
 But e swung is orses andsome when it came to Action Front
 An if one wheel was juicy you may lay your Monday head
 Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread

 The moril of this story it is plainly to be seen
 You avnt got no families when servin of the Queen
 You avnt got no brothers fathers sisters wives or sons
 If you want to win your battles take an work your bloomin guns
 Down in the Infantry nobody cares
 Down in the Cavalry Colonel e swears
 But down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
 Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog

Belts

 There was a row in Silver Street thats near to Dublin Quay
 Between an Irish regiment an English cavalree
 It started at Revelly an it lasted on till dark
 The first man dropped at Harrisons the last forninst the Park
 For it wasBelts belts belts an thats one for you
 An it was Belts belts belts an thats done for you
 O buckle an tongue
 Was the song that we sung
 From Harrisons down to the Park

 There was a row in Silver Streetthe regiments was out
 They called us Delhi Rebels an we answered Threes about
 That drew them like a hornets nestwe met them good an large
 The English at the double an the Irish at the charge
 Then it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetan I was in it too
 We passed the time o day an then the belts went whirraru
 I misremember what occurred but subsequint the storm
 A Freemans Journal Supplemint was all my uniform
 O it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetthey sent the Polis there
 The English were too drunk to know the Irish didnt care
 But when they grew impertinint we simultaneous rose
 Till half o them was Liffey mud an half was tatthered cloes
 For it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetit might ha raged till now
 But some one drew his sidearm clear an nobody knew how
 Twas Hogan took the point an dropped we saw the red blood run
 An so we all was murderers that started out in fun
 While it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetbut that put down the shine
 Wid each man whisperin to his next Twas never work o mine
 We went away like beaten dogs an down the street we bore him
 The poor dumb corpse that couldnt tell the bhoys were sorry for him
 When it wasBelts

 There was a row in Silver Streetit isnt over yet
 For half of us are under guard wid punishments to get
 Tis all a merricle to me as in the Clink I lie
 There was a row in Silver Streetbegod I wonder why
 But it wasBelts belts belts an thats one for you
 An it was Belts belts belts an thats done for you
 O buckle an tongue
 Was the song that we sung
 From Harrisons down to the Park




The Young British Soldier

 When the arfmade recruity goes out to the East
 E acts like a babe an e drinks like a beast
 An e wonders because e is frequent deceased
 Ere es fit for to serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Serve serve serve as a soldier
 Sooldier of the Queen

 Now all you recruities whats drafted today
 You shut up your ragbox an ark to my lay
 An Ill sing you a soldier as far as I may
 A soldier whats fit for a soldier
 Fit fit fit for a soldier

 First mind you steer clear o the grogsellers huts
 For they sell you Fixed Baynets that rots out your guts
 Ay drink that ud eat the live steel from your butts
 An its bad for the young British soldier
 Bad bad bad for the soldier

 When the cholera comesas it will past a doubt
 Keep out of the wet and dont go on the shout
 For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out
 An it crumples the young British soldier
 Crum crum crumples the soldier

 But the worst o your foes is the sun overead
 You must wear your elmet for all that is said
 If e finds you uncovered ell knock you down dead
 An youll die like a fool of a soldier
 Fool fool fool of a soldier

 If youre cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind
 Dont grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind
 Be handy and civil and then you will find
 That its beer for the young British soldier
 Beer beer beer for the soldier

 Now if you must marry take care she is old
 A troopsergeants widows the nicest Im told
 For beauty wont help if your rations is cold
 Nor love aint enough for a soldier
 Nough nough nough for a soldier

 If the wife should go wrong with a comrade be loath
 To shoot when you catch emyoull swing on my oath
 Make im take er and keep er thats Hell for them both
 An youre shut o the curse of a soldier
 Curse curse curse of a soldier

 When first under fire an youre wishful to duck
 Dont look nor take eed at the man that is struck
 Be thankful youre livin and trust to your luck
 And march to your front like a soldier
 Front front front like a soldier

 When arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch
 Dont call your Martini a crosseyed old bitch
 Shes human as you areyou treat her as sich
 An shell fight for the young British soldier
 Fight fight fight for the soldier

 When shakin their bustles like ladies so fine
 The guns o the enemy wheel into line
 Shoot low at the limbers an dont mind the shine
 For noise never startles the soldier
 Start start startles the soldier

 If your officers dead and the sergeants look white
 Remember its ruin to run from a fight
 So take open order lie down and sit tight
 And wait for supports like a soldier
 Wait wait wait like a soldier

 When youre wounded and left on Afghanistans plains
 And the women come out to cut up what remains
 Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
 An go to your Gawd like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier
 Go go go like a soldier

Mandalay

 By the old Moulmein Pagoda lookin eastward to the sea
 Theres a Burma girl asettin and I know she thinks o me
 For the wind is in the palmtrees and the templebells they say
 Come you back you British soldier come you back to Mandalay
 Come you back to Mandalay
 Where the old Flotilla lay
 Cant you ear their paddles chunkin from Rangoon to Mandalay
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the flyinfishes play
 An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

 Er petticoat was yaller an er little cap was green
 An er name was Supiyawlatjes the same as Theebaws Queen
 An I seed her first asmokin of a whackin white cheroot
 An awastin Christian kisses on an eathen idols foot
 Bloomin idol made omud
 Wot they called the Great Gawd Budd
 Plucky lot she cared for idols when I kissed er where she stud
 On the road to Mandalay

 When the mist was on the ricefields an the sun was droppin slow
 Shed git er little banjo an shed sing Kullalolo
 With er arm upon my shoulder an er cheek agin my cheek
 We useter watch the steamers an the hathis pilin teak
 Elephints apilin teak
 In the sludgy squdgy creek
 Where the silence ung that eavy you was arf afraid to speak
 On the road to Mandalay

 But thats all shove beind melong ago an fur away
 An there aint no busses runnin from the Bank to Mandalay
 An Im learnin ere in London what the tenyear soldier tells
 If youve eard the East acallin you wont never eed naught else
 No you wont eed nothin else
 But them spicy garlic smells
 An the sunshine an the palmtrees an the tinkly templebells
 On the road to Mandalay

 I am sick o wastin leather on these gritty pavinstones
 An the blasted Henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
 Tho I walks with fifty ousemaids outer Chelsea to the Strand
 An they talks a lot o lovin but wot do they understand
 Beefy face an grubby and
 Law wot do they understand
 Ive a neater sweeter maiden in a cleaner greener land
 On the road to Mandalay

 Ship me somewheres east of Suez where the best is like the worst
 Where there arent no Ten Commandments an a man can raise a thirst
 For the templebells are callin an its there that I would be
 By the old Moulmein Pagoda looking lazy at the sea
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the old Flotilla lay
 With our sick beneath the awnings when we went to Mandalay
 On the road to Mandalay
 Where the flyinfishes play
 An the dawn comes up like thunder outer China crost the Bay

GentlemenRankers

 To the legion of the lost ones to the cohort of the damned
 To my brethren in their sorrow overseas
 Sings a gentleman of England cleanly bred machinely crammed
 And a trooper of the Empress if you please
 Yea a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses
 And faith he went the pace and went it blind
 And the world was more than kin while he held the ready tin
 But today the Sergeants something less than kind
 Were poor little lambs whove lost our way
 Baa Baa Baa
 Were little black sheep whove gone astray
 Baaaaaa
 Gentlemenrankers out on the spree
 Damned from here to Eternity
 God ha mercy on such as we
 Baa Yah Bah

 Oh its sweet to sweat through stables sweet to empty kitchen slops
 And its sweet to hear the tales the troopers tell
 To dance with blowzy housemaids at the regimental hops
 And thrash the cad who says you waltz too well
 Yes it makes you cockahoop to be Rider to your troop
 And branded with a blasted worsted spur
 When you envy O how keenly one poor Tommy being cleanly
 Who blacks your boots and sometimes calls you Sir

 If the home we never write to and the oaths we never keep
 And all we know most distant and most dear
 Across the snoring barrackroom return to break our sleep
 Can you blame us if we soak ourselves in beer
 When the drunken comrade mutters and the great guardlantern gutters
 And the horror of our fall is written plain
 Every secret selfrevealing on the aching whitewashed ceiling
 Do you wonder that we drug ourselves from pain

 We have done with Hope and Honour we are lost to Love and Truth
 We are dropping down the ladder rung by rung
 And the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth
 God help us for we knew the worst too young
 Our shame is clean repentance for the crime that brought the sentence
 Our pride it is to know no spur of pride
 And the Curse of Reuben holds us till an alien turf enfolds us
 And we die and none can tell Them where we died
 Were poor little lambs whove lost our way
 Baa Baa Baa
 Were little black sheep whove gone astray
 Baaaaaa
 Gentlemenrankers out on the spree
 Damned from here to Eternity
 God ha mercy on such as we
 Baa Yah Bah

 Like a lot of button mushrooms when you pick em up at ome
 But its over in a minute an at six the column starts
 While the women and the kiddies sit an shiver in the carts
 An its best foot first

 Oh then its open order an we lights our pipes an sings
 An we talks about our rations an a lot of other things
 An we thinks o friends in England an we wonders what theyre at
 An ow they would admire for to hear us sling the bat
 An its best foot first
 Its none so bad o Sunday when youre lyin at your ease
 To watch the kites awheelin round them feathereaded trees
 For although there aint no women yet there aint no barrickyards
 So the orficers goes shootin an the men they plays at cards
 Till its best foot first

 So ark an eed you rookies which is always grumblin sore
 Theres worser things than marchin from Umballa to Cawnpore
 An if your eels are blistered an they feels to urt like ell
 You drop some tallow in your socks an that will make em well
 For its best foot first

 Were marchin on relief over Injias coral strand

 My name is OKelly Ive heard the Revelly
 From Birr to Bareilly from Leeds to Lahore
 HongKong and Peshawur
 Lucknow and Etawah
 And fiftyfive more all endin in pore
 Black Death and his quickness the depth and the thickness
 Of sorrow and sickness Ive known on my way
 But Im old and Im nervis
 Im cast from the Service
 And all I deserve is a shillin a day
 Chorus Shillin a day
 Bloomin good pay
 Lucky to touch it a shillin a day

 Oh it drives me half crazy to think of the days I
 Went slap for the Ghazi my sword at my side
 When we rode Hellforleather
 Both squadrons together
 That didnt care whether we lived or we died
 But its no use despairin my wife must go charin
 An me commissairin the paybills to better
 So if me you beold
 In the wet and the cold
 By the Grand Metropold wont you give me a letter
 Full chorus Give im a letter
 Cant do no better
 Late TroopSergeantMajor anruns with a letter
 Think what es been
 Think what es seen
 Think of his pension an

 Gawd save the Queen

Soldier an Salor Too

 As I was spittin into the Ditch aboard o the Crocodile
 I seed a man on a manowar got up in the Reglars style
 E was scrapin the paint from off of er plates
 an I sez to im Oo are you
 Sez e Im a JollyEr Majestys Jollysoldier an sailor too
 Now is work begins by Gawd knows when and is work is never through
 E isnt one o the reglar Line nor e isnt one of the crew
 Es a kind of a giddy harumfroditesoldier an sailor too

 An after I met im all over the world adoin all kinds of things
 Like landin isself with a Gatlin gun to talk to them eathen kings
 E sleeps in an ammick instead of a cot
 an e drills with the deck on a slew
 An e sweats like a JollyEr Majestys Jollysoldier an sailor too
 For there isnt a job on the top o the earth the beggar dont know nor do
 You can leave im at night on a bald mans ead to paddle is own canoe
 Es a sort of a bloomin cosmopolousesoldier an sailor too

 Weve fought em in trooper weve fought em in dock
 and drunk with em in betweens
 When they called us the seasick scullrymaids
 an we called em the Ass Marines
 But when we was down for a double fatigue from Woolwich to Bernardmyo
 We sent for the JolliesEr Majestys Jolliessoldier an sailor too
 They think for emselves an they steal for emselves
 and they never ask whats to do
 But theyre camped an fed an theyre up an fed before our bugles blew
 Ho they aint no limpin procrastitutessoldier an sailor too

 You may say we are fond of an arnesscut or ootin in barrickyards
 Or startin a Board School mutiny along o the Onion Guards
 But once in a while we can finish in style for the ends of the earth to view
 The same as the JolliesEr Majestys Jolliessoldier an sailor too
 They come of our lot they was brothers to us
 they was beggars wed met an knew
 Yes barrin an inch in the chest an the arm they was doubles o me an you
 For they werent no special chrysanthemumssoldier an sailor too

 To take your chance in the thick of a rush with firing all about
 Is nothing so bad when youve cover to and an leave an likin to shout
 But to stand an be still to the Birkenead drill
 is a damn tough bullet to chew
 An they done it the JolliesEr Majestys Jollies
 soldier an sailor too
 Their work was done when it adnt begun they was younger nor me an you
 Their choice it was plain between drownin in eaps
 an bein mopped by the screw
 So they stood an was still to the Birkenead drill soldier an sailor too

 Were most of us liars were arf of us thieves
 an the rest are as rank as can be
 But once in a while we can finish in style
 which I ope it wont appen to me
 But it makes you think better o you an your friends
 an the work you may ave to do
 When you think o the sinkin Victoriers Jolliessoldier an sailor too
 Now there isnt no room for to say ye dont know
 they ave proved it plain and true
 That whether its Widow or whether its ship Victoriers work is to do
 An they done it the JolliesEr Majestys Jollies

That Day

 It got beyond all orders an it got beyond all ope
 It got to shammin wounded an retirin from the alt
 Ole companies was lookin for the nearest road to slope
 It were just a bloomin knockoutan our fault

 Now there aint no chorus ere to give
 Nor there aint no band to play
 An I wish I was dead fore I done what I did
 Or seen what I seed that day

 We was sick o bein punished an we let em know it too
 An a companycommander up an it us with a sword
 An some one shouted Ook it an it come to sovekipoo
 An we chucked our rifles from usO my Gawd

 There was thirty dead an wounded on the ground we wouldnt keep
 No there wasnt more than twenty when the front begun to go
 But Christ along the line o flight they cut us up like sheep
 An that was all we gained by doin so

 I eard the knives beind me but I dursnt face my man
 Nor I dont know where I went to cause I didnt alt to see
 Till I eard a beggar squealin out for quarter as e ran
 An I thought I knew the voice anit was me

 We was idin under bedsteads more than arf a march away
 We was lyin up like rabbits all about the countryside
 An the major cursed is Maker cause e lived to see that day
 An the colonel broke is sword acrost an cried

 We was rotten fore we startedwe was never disciplined
 We made it out a favour if an order was obeyed
 Yes every little drummer ad is rights an wrongs to mind
 So we had to pay for teachinan we paid

 The papers id it andsome but you know the Army knows
 We was put to groomin camels till the regiments withdrew
 An they gave us each a medal for subduin Englands foes
 An I ope you like my songbecause its true

 An there aint no chorus ere to give
 Nor there aint no band to play
 But I wish I was dead fore I done what I did
 Or seen what I seed that day




The Men that fought at Minden

 A Song of Instruction

 The men that fought at Minden they was rookies in their time
 So was them that fought at Waterloo
 All the ole command yuss from Minden to Maiwand
 They was once dam sweeps like you

 Then do not be discouraged Eaven is your elper
 Well learn you not to forget
 An you mustnt swear an curse or youll only catch it worse
 For well make you soldiers yet

 The men that fought at Minden they ad stocks beneath their chins
 Six inch igh an more
 But fatigue it was their pride and they would not be denied
 To clean the cookouse floor

 The men that fought at Minden they had anarchistic bombs
 Served to em by name of andgrenades
 But they got it in the eye same as you will byanby
 When they clubbed their fieldparades

 The men that fought at Minden they ad buttons up an down
 Twoantwenty dozen of em told
 But they didnt grouse an shirk at an hours extry work
 They kept em bright as gold

 The men that fought at Minden they was armed with musketoons
 Also they was drilled by alberdiers
 I dont know what they were but the sergeants took good care
 They washed beind their ears

 The men that fought at Minden they ad ever cash in and
 Which they did not bank nor save
 But spent it gay an free on their betterssuch as me
 For the good advice I gave

 The men that fought at Minden they was civilyuss they was
 Never didnt talk o rights an wrongs
 But they got it with the toe same as you will get itso
 For interrupting songs

 The men that fought at Minden they was several other things
 Which I dont remember clear
 But thats the reason why now the sixyear men are dry
 The rooks will stand the beer

 Then do not be discouraged Eaven is your elper
 Well learn you not to forget
 An you mustnt swear an curse or youll only catch it worse
 For well make you soldiers yet

 Soldiers yet if youve got it in you
 All for the sake of the Core
 Soldiers yet if we ave to skin you
 Run an get the beer Johnny RawJohnny Raw
 Ho run an get the beer Johnny Raw




Cholera Camp

 Weve got the cholerer in campits worse than forty fights
 Were dyin in the wilderness the same as Isrulites
 Its before us an beind us an we cannot get away
 An the doctors just reported weve ten more today

 Oh strike your camp an go the Bugles callin
 The Rains are fallin
 The dead are bushed an stoned to keep em safe below
 The Bands adoin all she knows to cheer us
 The Chaplains gone and prayed to Gawd to ear us
 To ear us
 O Lord for its akillin of us so

 Since August when it started its been stickin to our tail
 Though theyve ad us out by marches an theyve ad us back by rail
 But it runs as fast as trooptrains and we cannot get away
 An the sicklist to the Colonel makes ten more today

 There aint no fun in women nor there aint no bite to drink
 Its much too wet for shootin we can only march and think
 An at evenin down the nullahs we can ear the jackals say
 Get up you rotten beggars youve ten more today

 Twould make a monkey cough to see our way o doin things
 Lieutenants takin companies an captains takin wings
 An Lances actin Sergeantseight file to obey
 For weve lots o quick promotion on ten deaths a day

 Our Colonels white an twitterlye gets no sleep nor food
 But mucks about in orspital where nothing does no good
 E sends us eaps o comforts all bought from is pay
 But there arent much comfort andy on ten deaths a day

 Our Chaplains got a banjo an a skinny mule e rides
 An the stuff e says an sings us Lord it makes us split our sides
 With is black coattails abobbin to Tarara Boomderay
 Es the proper kind o padre for ten deaths a day

 An Father Victor elps im with our Roman Catholicks
 He knows an eap of Irish songs an rummy conjurin tricks
 An the two they works together when it comes to play or pray
 So we keep the ball arollin on ten deaths a day

 Weve got the cholerer in campweve got it ot an sweet
 It aint no Christmas dinner but its elped an we must eat
 Weve gone beyond the funkin cause weve found it doesnt pay
 An were rockin round the Districk on ten deaths a day

 Then strike your camp an go the Rains are fallin
 The Bugles callin
 The dead are bushed an stoned to keep em safe below
 An them that do not like it they can lump it
 An them that cannot stand it they can jump it
 Weve got to die somewheresome waysomeow
 We might as well begin to do it now
 Then Number One let down the tentpole slow
 Knock out the pegs an old the cornersso
 Fold in the flies furl up the ropes an stow
 Oh strikeoh strike your camp an go
 Gawd elp us




The Ladies

 Ive taken my fun where Ive found it
 Ive rogued an Ive ranged in my time
 Ive ad my pickin o sweetearts
 An four o the lot was prime
 One was an arfcaste widow
 One was a woman at Prome
 One was the wife of a jemadarsais
 An one is a girl at ome

 Now I arent no and with the ladies
 For takin em all along
 You never can say till youve tried em
 An then you are like to be wrong
 Theres times when youll think that you mightnt
 Theres times when youll know that you might
 But the things you will learn from the Yellow an Brown
 Theyll elp you a lot with the White

 I was a young un at Oogli
 Shy as a girl to begin
 Aggie de Castrer she made me
 An Aggie was clever as sin
 Older than me but my first un
 More like a mother she were
 Showed me the way to promotion an pay
 An I learned about women from er

 Then I was ordered to Burma
 Actin in charge o Bazar
 An I got me a tiddy live eathen
 Through buyin supplies off er pa
 Funny an yellow an faithful
 Doll in a teacup she were
 But we lived on the square like a truemarried pair
 An I learned about women from er

 Then we was shifted to Neemuch
 Or I might ha been keepin er now
 An I took with a shiny shedevil
 The wife of a nigger at Mhow
 Taught me the gipsyfolks bolee
 Kind o volcano she were
 For she knifed me one night cause I wished she was white
 And I learned about women from er

 Then I come ome in the trooper
 Long of a kid o sixteen
 Girl from a convent at Meerut
 The straightest I ever ave seen
 Love at first sight was er trouble
 She didnt know what it were
 An I wouldnt do such cause I liked er too much
 ButI learned about women from er

 Ive taken my fun where Ive found it
 An now I must pay for my fun
 For the more you ave known o the others
 The less will you settle to one
 An the end of its sittin and thinkin
 An dreamin Hellfires to see
 So be warned by my lot which I know you will not
 An learn about women from me

 What did the Colonels Lady think
 Nobody never knew
 Somebody asked the Sergeants wife
 An she told em true
 When you get to a man in the case
 Theyre like as a row of pins
 For the Colonels Lady an Judy OGrady
 Are sisters under their skins




Bill Awkins

 As anybody seen Bill Awkins
 Now ow in the devil would I know
 Es taken my girl out walkin
 An Ive got to tell im so
 Gawdblessim

 Now what in the devil ud ye do
 Id open is cheek to is chinstrap buckle

 So Ill pass im the time o day
 Gawdblessim

The Jacket

 Through the Plagues of Egyp we was chasin Arabi
 Gettin down an shovin in the sun
 An you might ave called us dirty an you might ha called us dry
 An you might ave eard us talkin at the gun
 But the Captain ad is jacket an the jacket it was new
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 An the wettin of the jacket is the proper thing to do
 Nor we didnt keep im waitin very long

 One day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt
 Loadin down the axlearms with case
 But the Captain knew is dooty an he took the crackers out
 An he put some proper liquor in its place
 An the Captain saw the shrapnel which is sixanthirty clear
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 Will you draw the weight sez e or will you draw the beer
 An we didnt keep im waitin very long
 For the Captain etc

 Then we trotted gentle not to break the bloomin glass
 Though the Arabites ad all their ranges marked
 But we dursnt ardly gallop for the most was bottled Bass
 An wed dreamed of it since we was disembarked
 So we fired economic with the shells we ad in and
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 But the beggars under cover ad the impidence to stand
 An we couldnt keep em waitin very long
 And the Captain etc

 So we finished arf the liquor an the Captain took champagne
 An the Arabites was shootin all the while
 An we left our wounded appy with the empties on the plain
 An we used the bloomin guns for projectile
 We limbered up an gallopedthere were nothin else to do
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 An the Battery came aboundin like a boundin kangaroo
 But they didnt watch us comin very long
 As the Captain etc

 We was goin most extendedwe was drivin very fine
 An the Arabites were loosin igh an wide
 Till the Captain took the glassy with a rattlin right incline
 An we dropped upon their eads the other side
 Then we give em quartersuch as adnt up and cut
 Orse Gunners listen to my song
 An the Captain stood a limberful of fizzysomethin Brutt
 But we didnt leave it fizzing very long
 For the Captain etc

 We might ha been courtmartialled but it all come out all right
 When they signalled us to join the main command
 There was every round expended there was every gunner tight
 An the Captain waved a corkscrew in is and
 But the Captain ad is jacket etc




The Eathen

 The eathen in is blindness bows down to wood an stone
 E dont obey no orders unless they is is own
 E keeps is sidearms awful e leaves em all about
 An then comes up the regiment an pokes the eathen out

 All along o dirtiness all along o mess
 All along o doin things rathermoreorless
 All along of abbynay kul an hazarho
 Mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so
 The young recruit is aughtye drafs from Gawd knows where
 They bid im show is stockins an lay is mattress square
 E calls it bloomin nonsensee doesnt know no more
 An then up comes is Company an kicks im round the floor

 The young recruit is ammerede takes it very ard
 E angs is ead an mutterse sulks about the yard
 E talks o cruel tyrants ell swing for byanby
 An the others ears an mocks im an the boy goes orf to cry

 The young recruit is sillye thinks o suicide
 Es lost is gutterdevil e asnt got is pride
 But day by day they kicks im which elps im on a bit
 Till e finds isself one mornin with a full an proper kit

 Gettin clear o dirtiness gettin done with mess
 Gettin shut o doin things rathermoreorless
 Not so fond of abbynay kul nor hazarho
 Learns to keep is rifle an isself jus so

 The young recruit is appye throws a chest to suit
 You see im grow mustaches you ear im slap is boot
 E learns to drop the bloodies from every word e slings
 An e shows an ealthy brisket when e strips for bars an rings

 The crueltyrantsergeants they watch im arf a year
 They watch im with is comrades they watch im with is beer
 They watch im with the women at the regimental dance
 And the crueltyrantsergeants send is name along for Lance

 An now es arf o nothin an all a private yet
 Is room they up an rags im to see what they will get
 They rags im low an cunnin each dirty trick they can
 But e learns to sweat is temper an e learns to sweat is man

 An last a ColourSergeant as such to be obeyed
 E schools is men at cricket e tells em on parade
 They sees em quick an andy uncommon set an smart
 An so e talks to orficers which ave the Core at eart

 E learns to do is watchin without it showin plain
 E learns to save a dummy an shove im straight again
 E learns to check a ranker thats buyin leave to shirk
 An e learns to make men like im so theyll learn to like their work

 An when it comes to marchin hell see their socks are right
 An when it comes to action e shows em ow to sight
 E knows their ways of thinkin and just whats in their mind
 E knows when they are takin on an when theyve fell beind

 E knows each talkin corpril that leads a squad astray
 E feels is innards eavin is bowels givin way
 E sees the bluewhite faces all tryin ard to grin
 An e stands an waits an suffers till its time to cap em in

 An now the hugly bullets come peckin through the dust
 An no one wants to face em but every beggar must
 So like a man in irons which isnt glad to go
 They moves em off by companies uncommon stiff an slow

 Of all is five years schoolin they dont remember much
 Excep the not retreatin the step an keepin touch
 It looks like teachin wasted when they duck an spread an op
 But if e adnt learned em theyd be all about the shop

 An now its Oo goes backward an now its Oo comes on
 And now its Get the doolies an now the captains gone
 An now its bloody murder but all the while they ear
 Is voice the same as barrick drill ashepherdin the rear

 Es just as sick as they are is eart is like to split
 But e works em works em works em till he feels em take the bit
 The rest is oldin steady till the watchful bugles play
 An e lifts em lifts em lifts em through the charge that wins the day

 The eathen in is blindness bows down to wood an stone
 E dont obey no orders unless they is is own
 The eathen in is blindness must end where e began
 But the backbone of the Army is the noncommissioned man

 Keep away from dirtinesskeep away from mess
 Dont get into doin things rathermoreorless
 Lets ha done with abbynay kul an hazarho
 Mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so

 The ShutEye Sentry
 Sez the Junior Orderly Sergeant
 To the Senior Orderly Man

 The moon was white on the barricks
 The road was white an wide

 Es usin is sword for a bicycle but sentry shut your eye
 An it was Pass Alls well Es called me Darlin Jane

 So he needed affidavits pretty badly byanby

 To swear to a touch o sun
 There was me ed kissed in the sentrybox
 As I ave not told in my song
 But I took my oath which were Bible truth
 I adnt seen nothin wrong

 Theres them thats ot an aughty
 Theres them thats cold an ard
 But there comes a night when the best gets tight
 And then turns out the Guard
 Ive seen them ide their liquor
 In every kind o way
 But most depends on makin friends
 With Privit Thomas A

 Es reelin rollin roarin tight but sentry shut your eye
 An it is Pass Alls well An thats the way it goes
 Well elp im for is mother an ell elp us byanby




Mary Pity Women

 You call yourself a man

 You done the worst you know

 Nice while it lasted an now it is over
 Tear out your eart an goodbye to your lover
 Whats the use o grievin when the mother that bore you
 Mary pity women knew it all before you

 It arent no false alarm
 The finish to your fun
 Youyou ave brung the arm
 An Im the ruined one
 An now youll off an run
 With some new fool in tow
 Your eart You avent none
 Ah Gawd I love you so

 When a man is tired there is naught will bind im
 All e solemn promised e will shove beind im
 Whats the good o prayin for The Wrath to strike im
 Mary pity women when the rest are like im

 Ive walked with men a bit
 But thisbut this is you
 So elp me Christ its true
 Where can I ide or go
 You coward through and through

 Love lies dead an you cannot kiss im livin
 Down the road e led you there is no returnin
 Mary pity women but youre late in learnin

 Youd like to treat me fair

 Whats the good o pleadin when the mother that bore you
 Mary pity women knew it all before you
 Sleep on is promises an wake to your sorrow
 Mary pity women for we sail tomorrow




For to Admire

 The Injian Ocean sets an smiles
 So sof so bright so bloomin blue
 There arent a wave for miles an miles
 Excep the jiggle from the screw
 The ship is swep the day is done
 The bugles gone for smoke and play
 An black agin the settin sun
 The Lascar sings Hum deckty hai

 For to admire an for to see
 For to beold this world so wide
 It never done no good to me
 But I cant drop it if I tried

 I see the sergeants pitchin quoits
 I ear the women laugh an talk
 I spy upon the quarterdeck
 The orficers an lydies walk
 I thinks about the things that was
 An leans an looks acrost the sea
 Till spite of all the crowded ship
 Theres no one lef alive but me

 The things that was which I ave seen
 In barrick camp an action too
 I tells them over by myself
 An sometimes wonders if theyre true
 For they was oddmost awful odd
 But all the same now they are oer
 There must be eaps o plenty such
 An if I wait Ill see some more

 Oh I ave come upon the books
 An frequent broke a barrick rule
 An stood beside an watched myself
 Beavin like a bloomin fool
 I paid my price for findin out
 Nor never grutched the price I paid
 But sat in Clink without my boots
 Admirin ow the world was made

 Beold a crowd upon the beam
 An umped above the sea appears
 Old Aden like a barrickstove
 That no ones lit for years an years
 I passed by that when I began
 An I go ome the road I came
 A timeexpired soldierman
 With six years service to is name

 My girl she said Oh stay with me
 My mother eld me to er breast
 Theyve never written none an so
 They must ave gone with all the rest
 With all the rest which I ave seen
 An found an known an met along
 I cannot say the things I feel
 And so I sing my evenin song

 For to admire an for to see
 For to beold this world so wide
 It never done no good to me
 But I cant drop it if I tried

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
