AUGUSTUS DOES HIS BIT

A TRUETOLIFE FARCE


By George Bernard Shaw


I wish to express my gratitude for certain good offices which Augustus
secured for me in January 1917 I had been invited to visit the theatre
of war in Flanders by the CommanderinChief an invitation which was
under the circumstances a summons to duty Thus I had occasion to
spend some days in procuring the necessary passport and other official
facilities for my journey It happened just then that the Stage Society
gave a performance of this little play It opened the heart of
every official to me I have always been treated with distinguished
consideration in my contracts with bureaucracy during the war but on
this occasion I found myself persona grata in the highest degree There
was only one word when the formalities were disposed of and that
was We are up against Augustus all day The showingup of Augustus
scandalized one or two innocent and patriotic critics who regarded the
prowess of the British army as inextricably bound up with Highcastle
prestige But our Government departments knew better their problem was
how to win the war with Augustus on their backs wellmeaning brave
patriotic but obstructively fussy selfimportant imbecile and
disastrous

Save for the satisfaction of being able to laugh at Augustus in the
theatre nothing as far as I know came of my dramatic reduction of him
to absurdity Generals admirals Prime Ministers and Controllers not
to mention Emperors Kaisers and Tsars were scrapped remorselessly at
home and abroad for their sins or services as the case might be But
Augustus stood like the Eddystone in a storm and stands so to this day
He gave us his word that he was indispensable and we took it

Augustus Does His Bit was performed for the first time at the Court
Theatre in London by the Stage Society on the 21st January 1917
with Lalla Vandervelde as The Lady F BJ Sharp as Lord Augustus
Highcastle and Charles Rock as Horatio Floyd Beamish




AUGUSTUS DOES HIS BIT

The Mayors parlor in the Town Hall of Little Pifflington Lord Augustus
Highcastle a distinguished member of the governing class in the
uniform of a colonel and very well preserved at fortyfive is
comfortably seated at a writingtable with his heels on it reading The
Morning Post The door faces him a little to his left at the other
side of the room The window is behind him In the fireplace a gas
stove On the table a bell button and a telephone Portraits of past
Mayors in robes and gold chains adorn the walls An elderly clerk with
a short white beard and whiskers and a very red nose shuffles in


AUGUSTUS hastily putting aside his paper and replacing his feet on the
floor Hullo Who are you

THE CLERK The staff a slight impediment in his speech adds to the
impression of incompetence produced by his age and appearance

AUGUSTUS You the staff What do you mean man

THE CLERK What I say There aint anybody else

AUGUSTUS Tush Where are the others

THE CLERK At the front

AUGUSTUS Quite right Most proper Why arent you at the front

THE CLERK Over age Fiftyseven

AUGUSTUS But you can still do your bit Many an older man is in the
GRs or volunteering for home defence

THE CLERK I have volunteered

AUGUSTUS Then why are you not in uniform

THE CLERK They said they wouldnt have me if I was given away with a
pound of tea Told me to go home and not be an old silly A sense of
unbearable wrong till now only smouldering in him bursts into flame
Young Bill Knight that I took with me got two and sevenpence I got
nothing Is it justice This country is going to the dogs if you ask
me

AUGUSTUS rising indignantly I do not ask you sir and I will not
allow you to say such things in my presence Our statesmen are the
greatest known to history Our generals are invincible Our army is
the admiration of the world Furiously How dare you tell me that the
country is going to the dogs

THE CLERK Why did they give young Bill Knight two and sevenpence and
not give me even my tram fare Do you call that being great statesmen
As good as robbing me I call it

AUGUSTUS Thats enough Leave the room He sits down and takes up his
pen settling himself to work The clerk shuffles to the door Augustus
adds with cold politeness Send me the Secretary

THE CLERK IM the Secretary I cant leave the room and send myself to
you at the same time can I

AUGUSTUS Dont be insolent Where is the gentleman I have been
corresponding with Mr Horatio Floyd Beamish

THE CLERK returning and bowing Here Me

AUGUSTUS You Ridiculous What right have you to call yourself by a
pretentious name of that sort

THE CLERK You may drop the Horatio Floyd Beamish is good enough for
me

AUGUSTUS Is there nobody else to take my instructions

THE CLERK Its me or nobody And for two pins Id chuck it Dont you
drive me too far Old uns like me is up in the world now

AUGUSTUS If we were not at war I should discharge you on the spot for
disrespectful behavior But England is in danger and I cannot think of
my personal dignity at such a moment Shouting at him Dont you think
of yours either worm that you are or Ill have you arrested under the
Defence of the Realm Act double quick

THE CLERK What do I care about the realm They done me out of two and
seven

AUGUSTUS Oh damn your two and seven Did you receive my letters

THE CLERK Yes

AUGUSTUS I addressed a meeting here last nightwent straight to the
platform from the train I wrote to you that I should expect you to be
present and report yourself Why did you not do so

THE CLERK The police wouldnt let me on the platform

AUGUSTUS Did you tell them who you were

THE CLERK They knew who I was Thats why they wouldnt let me up

AUGUSTUS This is too silly for anything This town wants waking up I
made the best recruiting speech I ever made in my life and not a man
joined

THE CLERK What did you expect You told them our gallant fellows is
falling at the rate of a thousand a day in the big push Dying for
Little Pifflington you says Come and take their places you says That
aint the way to recruit

AUGUSTUS But I expressly told them their widows would have pensions

THE CLERK I heard you Would have been all right if it had been the
widows you wanted to get round

AUGUSTUS rising angrily This town is inhabited by dastards I say
it with a full sense of responsibility DASTARDS They call themselves
Englishmen and they are afraid to fight

THE CLERK Afraid to fight You should see them on a Saturday night

AUGUSTUS Yes they fight one another but they wont fight the Germans

THE CLERK They got grudges again one another how can they have grudges
again the Huns that they never saw Theyve no imagination thats what
it is Bring the Huns here and theyll quarrel with them fast enough

AUGUSTUS returning to his seat with a grunt of disgust Mf Theyll
have them here if theyre not careful Seated Have you carried out my
orders about the war saving

THE CLERK Yes

AUGUSTUS The allowance of petrol has been reduced by three quarters

THE CLERK It has

AUGUSTUS And you have told the motorcar people to come here and
arrange to start munition work now that their motor business is stopped

THE CLERK It aint stopped Theyre busier than ever

AUGUSTUS Busy at what

THE CLERK Making small cars

AUGUSTUS NEW cars

THE CLERK The old cars only do twelve miles to the gallon Everybody
has to have a car that will do thirtyfive now

AUGUSTUS Cant they take the train

THE CLERK There aint no trains now Theyve tore up the rails and sent
them to the front

AUGUSTUS Psha

THE CLERK Well we have to get about somehow

AUGUSTUS This is perfectly monstrous Not in the least what I intended

THE CLERK Hell

AUGUSTUS Sir

THE CLERK explaining Hell they says is paved with good intentions

AUGUSTUS springing to his feet Do you mean to insinuate that hell is
paved with MY good intentionswith the good intentions of His Majestys
Government

THE CLERK I dont mean to insinuate anything until the Defence of the
Realm Act is repealed It aint safe

AUGUSTUS They told me that this town had set an example to all England
in the matter of economy I came down here to promise the Mayor a
knighthood for his exertions

THE CLERK The Mayor Where do I come in

AUGUSTUS You dont come in You go out This is a fool of a place Im
greatly disappointed Deeply disappointed Flinging himself back into
his chair Disgusted

THE CLERK What more can we do Weve shut up everything The picture
gallery is shut The museum is shut The theatres and picture shows is
shut I havent seen a movie picture for six months

AUGUSTUS Man man do you want to see picture shows when the Hun is at
the gate

THE CLERK mournfully I dont now though it drove me melancholy mad
at first I was on the point of taking a pennorth of rat poison

AUGUSTUS Why didnt you

THE CLERK Because a friend advised me to take to drink instead That
saved my life though it makes me very poor company in the mornings as
hiccuping perhaps youve noticed

AUGUSTUS Well upon my soul You are not ashamed to stand there and
confess yourself a disgusting drunkard

THE CLERK Well what of it Were at war now and everythings changed
Besides I should lose my job here if I stood drinking at the bar Im a
respectable man and must buy my drink and take it home with me And they
wont serve me with less than a quart If youd told me before the war
that I could get through a quart of whisky in a day I shouldnt have
believed you Thats the good of war it brings out powers in a man
that he never suspected himself capable of You said so yourself in your
speech last night

AUGUSTUS I did not know that I was talking to an imbecile You ought to
be ashamed of yourself There must be an end of this drunken slacking
Im going to establish a new order of things here I shall come down
every morning before breakfast until things are properly in train Have
a cup of coffee and two rolls for me here every morning at halfpast
ten

THE CLERK You cant have no rolls The only baker that baked rolls was
a Hun and hes been interned

AUGUSTUS Quite right too And was there no Englishman to take his
place

THE CLERK There was But he was caught spying and they took him up to
London and shot him

AUGUSTUS Shot an Englishman

THE CLERK Well it stands to reason if the Germans wanted to spy they
wouldnt employ a German that everybody would suspect dont it

AUGUSTUS rising again Do you mean to say you scoundrel that an
Englishman is capable of selling his country to the enemy for gold

THE CLERK Not as a general thing I wouldnt say it but theres men
here would sell their own mothers for two coppers if they got the
chance

AUGUSTUS Beamish its an ill bird that fouls its own nest

THE CLERK It wasnt me that let Little Pifflington get foul I dont
belong to the governing classes I only tell you why you cant have no
rolls

AUGUSTUS intensely irritated Can you tell me where I can find an
intelligent being to take my orders

THE CLERK One of the street sweepers used to teach in the school until
it was shut up for the sake of economy Will he do

AUGUSTUS What You mean to tell me that when the lives of the gallant
fellows in our trenches and the fate of the British Empire depend on
our keeping up the supply of shells you are wasting money on sweeping
the streets

THE CLERK We have to We dropped it for a while but the infant death
rate went up something frightful

AUGUSTUS What matters the death rate of Little Pifflington in a moment
like this Think of our gallant soldiers not of your squalling infants

THE CLERK If you want soldiers you must have children You cant buy em
in boxes like toy soldiers

AUGUSTUS Beamish the long and the short of it is you are no patriot
Go downstairs to your office and have that gas stove taken away and
replaced by an ordinary grate The Board of Trade has urged on me the
necessity for economizing gas

THE CLERK Our orders from the Minister of Munitions is to use gas
instead of coal because it saves material Which is it to be

AUGUSTUS bawling furiously at him Both Dont criticize your orders
obey them Yours not to reason why yours but to do and die Thats war
Cooling down Have you anything else to say

THE CLERK Yes I want a rise

AUGUSTUS reeling against the table in his horror A rise Horatio
Floyd Beamish do you know that we are at war

THE CLERK feebly ironical I have noticed something about it in the
papers Heard you mention it once or twice now I come to think of it

AUGUSTUS Our gallant fellows are dying in the trenches and you want a
rise

THE CLERK What are they dying for To keep me alive aint it Well
whats the good of that if Im dead of hunger by the time they come
back

AUGUSTUS Everybody else is making sacrifices without a thought of self
and you

THE CLERK Not half they aint Wheres the bakers sacrifice Wheres
the coal merchants Wheres the butchers Charging me double thats
how they sacrifice themselves Well I want to sacrifice myself that
way too Just double next Saturday double and not a penny less or no
secretary for you he stiffens himself shakily and makes resolutely for
the door

AUGUSTUS looking after him contemptuously Go miserable proGerman

THE CLERK rushing back and facing him Who are you calling a
proGerman

AUGUSTUS Another word and I charge you under the Act with discouraging
me Go

The clerk blenches and goes out cowed

The telephone rings

AUGUSTUS taking up the telephone receiver Hallo Yes who are
you oh Blueloo is it Yes theres nobody in the room fire away
What A spy A woman Yes brought it down with me Do you suppose
Im such a fool as to let it out of my hands Why it gives a list
of all our antiaircraft emplacements from Ramsgate to Skegness The
Germans would give a million for itwhat But how could she possibly
know about it I havent mentioned it to a soul except of course dear
Lucy Oh Toto and Lady Popham and that lot they dont count theyre
all right I mean that I havent mentioned it to any Germans Pooh
Dont you be nervous old chap I know you think me a fool but Im not
such a fool as all that If she tries to get it out of me Ill have
her in the Tower before you ring up again The clerk returns Shsh
Somebodys just come in ring off Goodbye He hangs up the receiver

THE CLERK Are you engaged His manner is strangely softened

AUGUSTUS What business is that of yours However if you will take the
trouble to read the society papers for this week you will see that I am
engaged to the Honorable Lucy Popham youngest daughter of

THE CLERK That aint what I mean Can you see a female

AUGUSTUS Of course I can see a female as easily as a male Do you
suppose Im blind

THE CLERK You dont seem to follow me somehow Theres a female
downstairs what you might call a lady She wants to know can you see
her if I let her up

AUGUSTUS Oh you mean am I disengaged Tell the lady I have just
received news of the greatest importance which will occupy my entire
attention for the rest of the day and that she must write for an
appointment

THE CLERK Ill ask her to explain her business to me I aint above
talking to a handsome young female when I get the chance going

AUGUSTUS Stop Does she seem to be a person of consequence

THE CLERK A regular marchioness if you ask me

AUGUSTUS Hm Beautiful did you say

THE CLERK A human chrysanthemum sir believe me

AUGUSTUS It will be extremely inconvenient for me to see her but the
country is in danger and we must not consider our own comfort Think
how our gallant fellows are suffering in the trenches Show her up The
clerk makes for the door whistling the latest popular ballad Stop
whistling instantly sir This is not a casino

CLERK Aint it You just wait till you see her He goes out

Augustus produces a mirror a comb and a pot of moustache pomade from
the drawer of the writingtable and sits down before the mirror to put
some touches to his toilet

The clerk returns devotedly ushering a very attractive lady
brilliantly dressed She has a dainty wallet hanging from her wrist
Augustus hastily covers up his toilet apparatus with The Morning Post
and rises in an attitude of pompous condescension

THE CLERK to Augustus Here she is To the lady May I offer you a
chair lady He places a chair at the writingtable opposite Augustus
and steals out on tiptoe

AUGUSTUS Be seated madam

THE LADY sitting down Are you Lord Augustus Highcastle

AUGUSTUS sitting also Madam I am

TAE LADY with awe The great Lord Augustus

AUGUSTUS I should not dream of describing myself so Madam but no
doubt I have impressed my countrymenand bowing gallantly may I
say my countrywomenas having some exceptional claims to their
consideration

THE LADY emotionally What a beautiful voice you have

AUGUSTUS What you hear madam is the voice of my country which
now takes a sweet and noble tone even in the harsh mouth of high
officialism

THE LADY Please go on You express yourself so wonderfully

AUGUSTUS It would be strange indeed if after sitting on thirtyseven
Royal Commissions mostly as chairman I had not mastered the art
of public expression Even the Radical papers have paid me the high
compliment of declaring that I am never more impressive than when I have
nothing to say

THE LADY I never read the Radical papers All I can tell you is that
what we women admire in you is not the politician but the man of
action the heroic warrior the beau sabreur

AUGUSTUS gloomily Madam I beg Please My military exploits are not
a pleasant subject unhappily

THE LADY Oh I know I know How shamefully you have been treated what
ingratitude But the country is with you The women are with you Oh do
you think all our hearts did not throb and all our nerves thrill when
we heard how when you were ordered to occupy that terrible quarry in
Hulluch and you swept into it at the head of your men like a seagod
riding on a tidal wave you suddenly sprang over the top shouting To
Berlin Forward dashed at the German army singlehanded and were cut
off and made prisoner by the Huns

AUGUSTUS Yes madam and what was my reward They said I had disobeyed
orders and sent me home Have they forgotten Nelson in the Baltic
Has any British battle ever been won except by a bold initiative I say
nothing of professional jealousy it exists in the army as elsewhere
but it is a bitter thought to me that the recognition denied me by my
countryor rather by the Radical cabal in the Cabinet which pursues my
family with rancorous class hatredthat this recognition I say came
to me at the hands of an enemyof a rank Prussian

THE LADY You dont say so

AUGUSTUS How else should I be here instead of starving to death in
Ruhleben Yes madam the Colonel of the Pomeranian regiment which
captured me after learning what I had done and conversing for an
hour with me on European politics and military strategy declared that
nothing would induce him to deprive my country of my services and set
me free I offered of course to procure the release in exchange of
a German officer of equal quality but he would not hear of it He was
kind enough to say he could not believe that a German officer answering
to that description existed With emotion I had my first taste of the
ingratitude of my own country as I made my way back to our lines A shot
from our front trench struck me in the head I still carry the flattened
projectile as a trophy he throws it on the table the noise it makes
testifies to its weight Had it penetrated to the brain I might never
have sat on another Royal Commission Fortunately we have strong heads
we Highcastles Nothing has ever penetrated to our brains

THE LADY How thrilling How simple And how tragic But you will
forgive England Remember England Forgive her

AUGUSTUS with gloomy magnanimity It will make no difference whatever
to my services to my country Though she slay me yet will I if not
exactly trust in her at least take my part in her government I am ever
at my countrys call Whether it be the embassy in a leading European
capital a governorgeneralship in the tropics or my humble mission
here to make Little Pifflington do its bit I am always ready for the
sacrifice Whilst England remains England wherever there is a public
job to be done you will find a Highcastle sticking to it And now
madam enough of my tragic personal history You have called on
business What can I do for you

THE LADY You have relatives at the Foreign Office have you not

AUGUSTUS haughtily Madam the Foreign Office is staffed by my
relatives exclusively

THE LADY Has the Foreign Office warned you that you are being pursued
by a female spy who is determined to obtain possession of a certain list
of gun emplacements

AUGUSTUS interrupting her somewhat loftily All that is perfectly well
known to this department madam

THE LADY surprised and rather indignant Is it Who told you Was it
one of your German brothersinlaw

AUGUSTUS injured remonstrating I have only three German
brothersinlaw madam Really from your tone one would suppose that
I had several Pardon my sensitiveness on that subject but reports are
continually being circulated that I have been shot as a traitor in
the courtyard of the Ritz Hotel simply because I have German
brothersinlaw With feeling If you had a German brotherinlaw
madam you would know that nothing else in the world produces so strong
an antiGerman feeling Life affords no keener pleasure than finding a
brotherinlaws name in the German casualty list

THE LADY Nobody knows that better than I Wait until you hear what
I have come to tell you you will understand me as no one else could
Listen This spy this woman

AUGUSTUS all attention Yes

THE LADY She is a German A Hun

AUGUSTUS Yes yes She would be Continue

THE LADY She is my sisterinlaw

AUGUSTUS deferentially I see you are well connected madam Proceed

THE LADY Need I add that she is my bitterest enemy

AUGUSTUS May Ihe proffers his hand They shake fervently From this
moment onward Augustus becomes more and more confidential gallant and
charming

THE LADY Quite so Well she is an intimate friend of your brother at
the War Office Hungerford Highcastle Blueloo as you call him I dont
know why

AUGUSTUS explaining He was originally called The Singing Oyster
because he sang drawingroom ballads with such an extraordinary absence
of expression He was then called the Blue Point for a season or two
Finally he became Blueloo

THE LADY Oh indeed I didnt know Well Blueloo is simply infatuated
with my sisterinlaw and he has rashly let out to her that this list
is in your possession He forgot himself because he was in a towering
rage at its being entrusted to you his language was terrible He
ordered all the guns to be shifted at once

AUGUSTUS What on earth did he do that for

THE LADY I cant imagine But this I know She made a bet with him
that she would come down here and obtain possession of that list and get
clean away into the street with it He took the bet on condition that
she brought it straight back to him at the War Office

AUGUSTUS Good heavens And you mean to tell me that Blueloo was such a
dolt as to believe that she could succeed Does he take me for a fool

THE LADY Oh impossible He is jealous of your intellect The bet is
an insult to you dont you feel that After what you have done for our
country

AUGUSTUS Oh never mind that It is the idiocy of the thing I look at
Hell lose his bet and serve him right

THE LADY You feel sure you will be able to resist the siren I warn
you she is very fascinating

AUGUSTUS You need have no fear madam I hope she will come and try
it on Fascination is a game that two can play at For centuries the
younger sons of the Highcastles have had nothing to do but fascinate
attractive females when they were not sitting on Royal Commissions or on
duty at Knightsbridge barracks By Gad madam if the siren comes here
she will meet her match

THE LADY I feel that But if she fails to seduce you

AUGUSTUS blushing Madam

THE LADY continuingfrom your allegiance

AUGUSTUS Oh that

THE LADYshe will resort to fraud to force to anything She will
burgle your office she will have you attacked and garotted at night in
the street

AUGUSTUS Pooh Im not afraid

THE LADY Oh your courage will only tempt you into danger She may get
the list after all It is true that the guns are moved But she would
win her bet

AUGUSTUS cautiously You did not say that the guns were moved You
said that Blueloo had ordered them to be moved

THE LADY Well that is the same thing isnt it

AUGUSTUS Not quiteat the War Office No doubt those guns WILL be
moved possibly even before the end of the war

THE LADY Then you think they are there still But if the German War
Office gets the listand she will copy it before she gives it back to
Blueloo you may depend on itall is lost

AUGUSTUS lazily Well I should not go as far as that Lowering his
voice Will you swear to me not to repeat what I am going to say to
you for if the British public knew that I had said it I should be at
once hounded down as a proGerman

THE LADY I will be silent as the grave I swear it

AUGUSTUS again taking it easily Well our people have for some reason
made up their minds that the German War Office is everything that
our War Office is notthat it carries promptitude efficiency and
organization to a pitch of completeness and perfection that must be
in my opinion destructive to the happiness of the staff My own
viewwhich you are pledged remember not to betrayis that the German
War Office is no better than any other War Office I found that opinion
on my observation of the characters of my brothersinlaw one of whom
by the way is on the German general staff I am not at all sure that
this list of gun emplacements would receive the smallest attention You
see there are always so many more important things to be attended to
Family matters and so on you understand

THE LADY Still if a question were asked in the House of Commons

AUGUSTUS The great advantage of being at war madam is that nobody
takes the slightest notice of the House of Commons No doubt it is
sometimes necessary for a Minister to soothe the more seditious members
of that assembly by giving a pledge or two but the War Office takes no
notice of such things

THE LADY staring at him Then you think this list of gun emplacements
doesnt matter

AUGUSTUS By no means madam It matters very much indeed If this spy
were to obtain possession of the list Blueloo would tell the story at
every dinnertable in London and

THE LADY And you might lose your post Of course

AUGUSTUS amazed and indignant I lose my post What are you dreaming
about madam How could I possibly be spared There are hardly
Highcastles enough at present to fill half the posts created by this
war No Blueloo would not go that far He is at least a gentleman But
I should be chaffed and frankly I dont like being chaffed

THE LADY Of course not Who does It would never do Oh never never

AUGUSTUS Im glad you see it in that light And now as a measure
of security I shall put that list in my pocket He begins searching
vainly from drawer to drawer in the writingtable Where on earth
What the dickens did I Thats very odd IWhere the deuce I
thought I had put it in theOh here it is No this is Lucys last
letter

THE LADY elegiacally Lucys Last Letter What a title for a picture
play

AUGUSTUS delighted Yes it is isnt it Lucy appeals to the
imagination like no other woman By the way handing over the letter
I wonder could you read it for me Lucy is a darling girl but I really
cant read her writing In London I get the office typist to decipher it
and make me a typed copy but here there is nobody

THE LADY puzzling over it It is really almost illegible I think the
beginning is meant for Dearest Gus

AUGUSTUS eagerly Yes that is what she usually calls me Please go
on

THE LADY trying to decipher it What awhat aoh yes what a
forgetful oldsomethingyou are I cant make out the word

AUGUSTUS greatly interested Is it blighter That is a favorite
expression of hers

THE LADY I think so At all events it begins with a B Reading What
a forgetful oldshe is interrupted by a knock at the door

AUGUSTUS impatiently Come in The clerk enters clean shaven and in
khaki with an official paper and an envelope in his hand What is this
ridiculous mummery sir

THE CLERK coming to the table and exhibiting his uniform to both
Theyve passed me The recruiting officer come for me Ive had my two
and seven

AUGUSTUS rising wrathfully I shall not permit it What do they
mean by taking my office staff Good God they will be taking our hunt
servants next Confronting the clerk What did the man mean What did
he say

THE CLERK He said that now you was on the job wed want another million
men and he was going to take the oldage pensioners or anyone he could
get

AUGUSTUS And did you dare to knock at my door and interrupt my business
with this lady to repeat this mans ineptitudes

THE CLERK No I come because the waiter from the hotel brought this
paper You left it on the coffeeroom breakfasttable this morning

THE LADY intercepting it It is the list Good heavens

THE CLERK proffering the envelope He says he thinks this is the
envelope belonging to it

THE LADY snatching the envelope also Yes Addressed to you Lord
Augustus Augustus comes back to the table to look at it Oh how
imprudent Everybody would guess its importance with your name on it
Fortunately I have some letters of my own here opening her wallet
Why not hide it in one of my envelopes then no one will dream that the
enclosure is of any political value Taking out a letter she crosses
the room towards the window whispering to Augustus as she passes him
Get rid of that man

AUGUSTUS haughtily approaching the clerk who humorously makes a
paralytic attempt to stand at attention Have you any further business
here pray

THE CLERK Am I to give the waiter anything or will you do it yourself

AUGUSTUS Which waiter is it The English one

THE CLERK No the one that calls hisself a Swiss Shouldnt wonder if
hed made a copy of that paper

AUGUSTUS Keep your impertinent surmises to yourself sir Remember
that you are in the army now and let me have no more of your civilian
insubordination Attention Left turn Quick march

THE CLERK stolidly I dunno what you mean

AUGUSTUS Go to the guardroom and report yourself for disobeying
orders Now do you know what I mean

THE CLERK Now look here I aint going to argue with you

AUGUSTUS Nor I with you Out with you

He seizes the clerk and rushes him through the door The moment the
lady is left alone she snatches a sheet of official paper from the
stationery rack folds it so that it resembles the list compares the
two to see that they look exactly alike whips the list into her wallet
and substitutes the facsimile for it Then she listens for the return of
Augustus A crash is heard as of the clerk falling downstairs

Augustus returns and is about to close the door when the voice of the
clerk is heard from below

THE CLERK Ill have the law of you for this I will

AUGUSTUS shouting down to him Theres no more law for you you
scoundrel Youre a soldier now He shuts the door and comes to the
lady Thank heaven the war has given us the upper hand of these
fellows at last Excuse my violence but discipline is absolutely
necessary in dealing with the lower middle classes

THE LADY Serve the insolent creature right Look I have found you a
beautiful envelope for the list an unmistakable ladys envelope She
puts the sham list into her envelope and hands it to him

AUGUSTUS Excellent Really very clever of you Slyly Come would you
like to have a peep at the list beginning to take the blank paper from
the envelope

THE LADY on the brink of detection No no Oh please no

AUGUSTUS Why It wont bite you drawing it out further

THE LADY snatching at his hand Stop Remember if there should be an
inquiry you must be able to swear that you never showed that list to a
mortal soul

AUGUSTUS Oh that is a mere form If you are really curious

THE LADY I am not I couldnt bear to look at it One of my dearest
friends was blown to pieces by an aircraft gun and since then I have
never been able to think of one without horror

AUGUSTUS You mean it was a real gun and actually went off How sad
how sad He pushes the sham list back into the envelope and pockets
it

THE LADY Ah Great sigh of relief And now Lord Augustus I have
taken up too much of your valuable time Goodbye

AUGUSTUS What Must you go

THE LADY You are so busy

AUGUSTUS Yes but not before lunch you know I never can do much
before lunch And Im no good at all in the afternoon From five to six
is my real working time Must you really go

THE LADY I must really I have done my business very satisfactorily
Thank you ever so much she proffers her hand

AUGUSTUS shaking it affectionately as he leads her to the door but
fast pressing the bell button with his left hand Goodbye Goodbye So
sorry to lose you Kind of you to come but there was no real danger
You see my dear little lady all this talk about war saving and
secrecy and keeping the blinds down at night and so forth is all very
well but unless its carried out with intelligence believe me you may
waste a pound to save a penny you may let out all sorts of secrets to
the enemy you may guide the Zeppelins right on to your own chimneys
Thats where the ability of the governing class comes in Shall the
fellow call a taxi for you

THE LADY No thanks I prefer walking Goodbye Again many many
thanks

She goes out Augustus returns to the writingtable smiling and takes
another look at himself in the mirror The clerk returns with his head
bandaged carrying a poker

THE CLERK What did you ring for Augustus hastily drops the mirror
Dont you come nigh me or Ill split your head with this poker thick as
it is

AUGUSTUS It does not seem to me an exceptionally thick poker I rang
for you to show the lady out

THE CLERK Shes gone She run out like a rabbit I ask myself why was
she in such a hurry

THE LADYS VOICE from the street Lord Augustus Lord Augustus

THE CLERK Shes calling you
