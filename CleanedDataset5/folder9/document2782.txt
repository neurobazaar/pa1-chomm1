Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Wilhelm Tell

by Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller




Translator Theodore Martin




INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller was born at Marbach
Wurtemberg Germany November 10 1759 His father had served both as
surgeon and soldier in the War of the Austrian Succession and at the
time of the poets birth held an appointment under the Duke of
Wurtemberg Friedrichs education was begun with a view to holy
orders but this idea was given up when he was placed in a military
academy established by the Duke He tried the study of law and then of
medicine but his tastes were literary and while holding a position
as regimental surgeon he wrote his revolutionary drama The
Robbers which brought down on him the displeasure of his ducal
master Finding the interference with his personal liberty
intolerable he finally fled from the Duchy and in various retreats
went on with his dramatic work Later he turned to philosophy and
history and through his book on The Revolt of the Netherlands he was
appointed professor extraordinarius at Jena in 1789 His History of
the Thirty Years War appeared in 179093 and in 1794 began his
intimate relation with Goethe beside whom he lived in Weimar from
1799 till his death in 1805 His lyrical poems were produced
throughout his career but his last period was most prolific both in
these and in dramatic composition and includes such great works as
his Wallenstein Marie Stuart The Maid of Orleans The Bride
of Messina and William Tell 1804 His life was a continual
struggle against illhealth and unfavorable circumstances but he
maintained to the end the spirit of independence and love of liberty
which are the characteristic mark of his writings

This enthusiasm for freedom is well illustrated in William Tell the
most widely popular of his plays Based upon a worldwide legend which
became localized in Switzerland in the fifteenth century and was
incorporated into the history of the struggle of the Forest Cantons
for deliverance from Austrian domination it unites with the theme of
liberty that of the beauty of life in primitive natural conditions
and both in its likenesses and differences illustrates Schillers
attitude toward the principles of the French Revolution

ACT I


SCENE I

A high rocky shore of the Lake of Lucerne opposite Schwytz The lake
makes a bend into the land a hut stands at a short distance from the
shore the fisher boy is rowing about in his boat Beyond the lake are
seen the green meadows the hamlets and farms of Schwytz lying in the
clear sunshine On the left are observed the peaks of The Hacken
surrounded with clouds to the right and in the remote distance
appear the Glaciers The Ranz des Vaches and the tinkling of cattle
bells continue for some time after the rising of the curtain


FISHER BOY sings in his boat Melody of the Ranz des Vaches
The smiledimpled lake wood to bathe in its deep
A boy on its green shore had laid him to sleep
Then heard he a melody
Floating along
Sweet as the notes
Of an angels song
And as thrilling with pleasure he wakes from his rest
The waters are rippling over his breast
And a voice from the deep cries
With me thou must go
I charm the young shepherd
I lure him below

HERDSMAN on the mountains AirVariation of the Ranz des Vaches
Farewell ye green meadows
Farewell sunny shore
The herdsman must leave you
The summer is oer
We go to the hills but youll see us again
When the cuckoo calls and the merry birds sing
When the flowers bloom afresh in glade and in glen
And the brooks sparkle bright in the sunshine of Spring
Farewell ye green meadows
Farewell sunny shore
The herdsman must leave you
The summer is oer

CHAMOIS HUNTER appearing on the top of a cliff Second Variation of
 the Ranz des Vaches
On the heights peals the thunder and trembles the bridge
The huntsman bounds on by the dizzying ridge
Undaunted he hies him
Oer icecovered wild
Where leaf never budded
Nor Spring ever smiled
And beneath him an ocean of mist where his eye
No longer the dwellings of man can espy
Through the parting clouds only
The earth can be seen
Far down neath the vapour
The meadows of green

A change comes over the landscape A rumbling cracking noise is
heard among the mountains Shadows of clouds sweep across the scene
Ruodi the fisherman comes out of his cottage
Werni the huntsman descends from the rocks
Kuoni the shepherd enters with a milkpail on his shoulders followed
by Seppi his assistant

RUODI
Come Jenni bustle get the boat on shore
The grizzly ValeKing comes the Glaciers moan
The Mytenstein is drawing on his hood
And from the Stormcleft chilly blows the wind
The storm will burst before we know whats what

 The German is Thalvogt Ruler of the Valleythe name given
 figuratively to a dense grey mist which the south wind sweeps into
 the valleys from the mountain tops It is well known as the
 precursor of stormy weather

 A steep rock standing on the north of Rutli and nearly opposite
 to Brumen

KUONI
Twill rain ere long my sheep browse eagerly
And Watcher there is scraping up the earth

WERNI
The fish are leaping and the waterhen
Keeps diving up and down A storm is brewing

KUONI to his boy
Look Seppi if the beasts be all in sight

SEPPI
There goes brown Liesel I can hear her bells

KUONI
Then all are safe she ever ranges farthest

RUODI
Youve a fine chime of bells there master herdsman

WERNI
And likely cattle too Are they your own

KUONI
Im not so rich They are the noble lords
Of Attinghaus and told off to my care

RUODI
How gracefully yon heifer bears her ribbon

KUONI
Ay well she knows shes leader of the herd
And take it from her shed refuse to feed

RUODI
Youre joking now A beast devoid of reason

WERNI
Easily said But beasts have reason too
And that we know we chamoishunters well
They never turn to feedsagacious creatures
Till they have placed a sentinel ahead
Who pricks his ears whenever we approach
And gives alarm with clear and piercing pipe

RUODI to the shepherd
Are you for home

KUONI
The Alp is grazed quite bare

WERNI
A safe return my friend

KUONI
The same to you
Men come not always back from tracks like yours

RUODI
But who comes here running at topmost speed

WERNI
I know the man tis Baumgart of Alzellen

KONRAD BAUMGARTEN rushing in breathless
For Gods sake ferryman your boat

RUODI
How now Why all this haste

BAUM
Cast off My lifes at stake
Set me across

KUONI
Why whats the matter friend

WERNI
Who are pursuing you First tell us that

BAUM to the fisherman
Quick quick man quick theyre close upon my heels
It is the Viceroys men are after me
If they should overtake me I am lost

RUODI
Why are the troopers in pursuit of you

BAUM
First make me safe and then Ill tell you all

WERNI
Theres blood upon your garmentshow is this

BAUM
The Imperial Seneschal who dwelt at Rossberg

KUONI
How What The Wolfshot Is it he pursues you

 In German Wolfenschiessena young man of noble family and a
 native of Unterwalden who attached himself to the House of
 Austria and was appointed Burvogt or Seneschal of the Castle of
 Rossberg He was killed by Baumgarten in the manner and for the
 cause mentioned in the text

BAUM
Hell neer hurt man again Ive settled him

ALL starting back
Now God forgive you what is this youve done

BAUM
What every free man in my place had done
Mine own good household right I have enforced
Gainst him that would have wrongd my wifemy honour

KUONI
How Wronged you in your honour did he so

BAUM
That he did not fulfil his foul desire
Is due to God and to my trusty axe

WERNI
And you have cleft his skull then with your axe

KUONI
O tell us all Youve time enough and more
While he is getting out the boat there from the beach

BAUM
When I was in the forest felling timber
My wife came running out in mortal fear
The Seneschal she said was in my house
Had ordered her to get a bath prepared
And thereupon had taen unseemly freedoms
From which she rid herself and flew to me
Armd as I was I sought him and my axe
Has given his bath a bloody benison

WERNI
And you did well no man can blame the deed

KUONI
The tyrant Now he has his just reward We men of
Unterwald have owed it long

BAUM
The deed got wind and now theyre in pursuit
Heavens whilst we speak the time is flying fast

It begins to thunder

KUONI
Quick ferryman and set the good man over

RUODI
Impossible a storm is close at hand
Wait till it pass You must

BAUM
Almighty heavens
I cannot wait the least delay is death

KUONI to the fisherman
Push outGod with you
We should help our neighbours
The like misfortune may betide us all

Thunder and the roaring of the wind

RUODI
The Southwinds up See how the lake is rising
I cannot steer against both wind and wave

 Literally The Fohn is loose When says Muller in his History
 of Switzerland the wind called the Fohn is high the navigation
 of the lake becomes extremely dangerous Such is its vehemence
 that the laws of the country require that the fires shall be
 extinguished in the houses while it lasts and the night watches
 are doubled The inhabitants lay heavy stones upon the roofs of
 their houses to prevent their being blown away

BAUM clasping him by the knees
God so help you as now you pity me

WERNI
His lifes at stake Have pity on him man

KUONI
He is a father has a wife and children

Repeated peals of thunder

RUODI
What and have I not then a life to lose
A wife and child at home as well as he
See how the breakers foam and toss and whirl
And the lake eddies up from all its depths
Right gladly would I save the worthy man
But tis impossible as you must see

BAUM still kneeling
Then must I fall into the tyrants hands
And with the shore of safety close in sight
Yonder it lies My eyes can see it clear
My very voice can echo to its shores
There is the boat to carry me across
Yet must I lie here helpless and forlorn

KUONI
Look who comes here

RUODI
Tis Tell ay Tell of Burglen

 Burglen the birthplace and residence of Tell A chapel erected
 in 1522 remains on the spot formerly occupied by his house

Enter Tell with a crossbow

TELL
What man is he that here implores of aid

KUONI
He is from Alzellen and to guard his honour
From touch of foulest shame has slain the Wolfshot
The Imperial Seneschal who dwelt at Rossberg
The Viceroys troopers are upon his heels
He begs the ferryman to take him over
But frightened at the storm he says he wont

RUODI
Well there is Tell can steer as well as I
Hell be my judge if it be possible

Violent peals of thunderthe lake becomes more tempestuous

Am I to plunge into the jaws of hell
I should be mad to dare the desperate act

TELL
The brave man thinks upon himself the last
Put trust in God and help him in his need

RUODI
Safe in the port tis easy to advise
There is the boat and there the lake Try you

TELL
The lake may pity but the Viceroy never
Come risk it man

SHEPHERD and HUNTSMAN
O save him save him save him

RUODI
Though twere my brother or my darling child
I would not go Tis Simon and Judes day
The lake is up and calling for its victim

TELL
Noughts to be done with idle talking here
Each moments precious the man must be helpd
Say boatman will you venture

RUODI
No not I

TELL
In Gods name then give me the boat I will
With my poor strength see what is to be done

KUONI
Ha gallant Tell

WERNI
Thats like a huntsman true

BAUM
You are my angel my preserver Tell

TELL
I may preserve you from the Viceroys power
But from the tempests rage another must
Yet better tis you fall into Gods hands
Than into those of men

To the herdsman

Herdsman do thou
Console my wife if I should come to grief
I could not choose but do as I have done

He leaps into the boat

KUONI to the fisherman
A pretty man to keep a ferry truly
What Tell could risk you dared not venture on

RUODI
Far better men would never cope with Tell
Theres no two such as he mong all our hills

WERNI who has ascended a rock
Now he is off God help thee gallant sailor
Look how the little boat reels on the waves
There they have swept clean over it And now

KUONI on the shore
Tis out of sight Yet stay there tis again
Stoutly he stems the breakers noble fellow

SEPPI
Here come the troopers hard as they can ride

KUONI
Heavens so they do Why that was help indeed

Enter a troop of horsemen

1ST H
Give up the murderer You have him here

2ND H
This way he came Tis useless to conceal him

RUODI and KUONI
Whom do you mean

1ST H discovering the boat
The devil What do I see

WERNI from above
Isnt he in yonder boat ye seek Ride on
If you lay to you may oertake him yet

2ND H
Curse on you hes escaped

1ST H to the shepherd and fisherman
You helpd him off
And you shall pay for it Fall on their herds
Down with the cottage burn it beat it down

They rush off

SEPPI hurrying after them
Oh my poor lambs

KUONI following him
Unhappy me my herds

WERNI
The tyrants

RUODI wringing his hands
Righteous Heaven Oh when will come
Deliverance to this doomdevoted land

Exeunt severally


SCENE II

A lime tree in front of Stauffachers house at Steinen in Schwytz
upon the public road near a bridge

Werner Stauffacher and Pfeiffer of Lucerne enter into conversation


PFEIFF
Ay ay friend Stauffacher as I have said
Swear not to Austria if you can help it
Hold by the Empire stoutly as of yore
And God preserve you in your ancient freedom

Presses his hand warmly and is going

STAUFF
Wait till my mistress comes Now do You are
My guest in SchwytzI in Lucerne am yours

PFEIFF
Thanks thanks But I must reach Gersau today
Whatever grievances your rulers pride
And grasping avarice may yet inflict
Bear them in patiencesoon a change may come
Another emperor may mount the throne
But Austrias once and you are hers for ever

Exit

Stauffacher sits down sorrowfully upon a bench under the lime tree
Gertrude his wife enters and finds him in this posture She places
herself near him and looks at him for some time in silence

GERT
So sad my love I scarcely know thee now
For many a day in silence I have markd
A moody sorrow furrowing thy brow
Some silent grief is weighing on thy heart
Trust it to me I am thy faithful wife
And I demand my half of all thy cares

Stauffacher gives her his hand and is silent

Tell me what can oppress thy spirits thus
Thy toil is blestthe world goes well with thee
Our barns are fullour cattle many a score
Our handsome team of wellfed horses too
Brought from the mountain pastures safely home
To winter in their comfortable stalls
There stands thy houseno noblemans more fair
Tis newly built with timber of the best
All grooved and fitted with the nicest skill
Its many glistening windows tell of comfort
Tis quarterd oer with scutcheons of all hues
And proverbs sage which passing travellers
Linger to read and ponder oer their meaning

STAUFF
The house is strongly built and handsomely
But ah the ground on which we built it quakes

GERT
Tell me dear Werner what you mean by that

STAUFF
No later gone than yesterday I sat
Beneath this linden thinking with delight
How fairly all was finished when from Kussnacht
The Viceroy and his men came riding by
Before this house he halted in surprise
At once I rose and as beseemed his rank
Advanced respectfully to greet the lord
To whom the Emperor delegates his power
As judge supreme within our Canton here
Who is the owner of this house he asked
With mischief in his thoughts for well he knew
With prompt decision thus I answered him
The Emperor your gracemy lord and yours
And held by me in fief On this he answered
I am the Emperors viceregent here
And will not that each peasant churl should build
At his own pleasure bearing him as freely
As though he were the master in the land
I shall make bold to put a stop to this
So saying he with menaces rode off
And left me musing with a heavy heart
On the fell purpose that his words betrayd

GERT
My own dear lord and husband Wilt thou take
A word of honest counsel from thy wife
I boast to be the noble Ibergs child
A man of wide experience Many a time
As we sat spinning in the winter nights
My sisters and myself the peoples chiefs
Were wont to gather round our fathers hearth
To read the old imperial charters and
To hold sage converse on the countrys weal
Then heedfully I listened marking well
What now the wise man thought the good man wished
And garnerd up their wisdom in my heart
Hear then and mark me well for thou wilt see
I long have known the grief that weighs thee down
The Viceroy hates thee fain would injure thee
For thou hast crossd his wish to bend the Swiss
In homage to this upstart house of princes
And kept them staunch like their good sires of old
In true allegiance to the Empire Say
Ist not so Werner Tell me am I wrong

STAUFF
Tis even so For this doth Gessler hate me

GERT
He burns with envy too to see thee living
Happy and free on thine ancestral soil
For he is landless From the Emperors self
Thou holdst in fief the lands thy fathers left thee
Theres not a prince i the Empire that can show
A better title to his heritage
For thou hast over thee no lord but one
And he the mightiest of all Christian kings
Gessler we know is but a younger son
His only wealth the knightly cloak he wears
He therefore views an honest mans good fortune
With a malignant and a jealous eye
Long has he sworn to compass thy destruction
As yet thou art uninjured Wilt thou wait
Till he may safely give his malice vent
A wise man would anticipate the blow

STAUFF
Whats to be done

GERT
Now hear what I advise
Thou knowest well how here with us in Schwytz
All worthy men are groaning underneath
This Gesslers grasping grinding tyranny
Doubt not the men of Unterwald as well
And Uri too are chafing like ourselves
At this oppressive and heartwearying yoke
For there across the lake the Landenberg
Wields the same iron rule as Gessler here
No fishingboat comes over to our side
But brings the tidings of some new encroachment
Some fresh outrage more grievous than the last
Then it were well that some of youtrue men
Men sound at heart should secretly devise
How best to shake this hateful thraldom off
Full sure I am that God would not desert you
But lend His favour to the righteous cause
Has thou no friend in Uri one to whom
Thou frankly mayst unbosom all thy thoughts

STAUFF
I know full many a gallant fellow there
And nobles toogreat men of high repute
In whom I can repose unbounded trust

Rising

Wife What a storm of wild and perilous thoughts
Hast thou stirrd up within my tranquil breast
The darkest musings of my bosom thou
Hast draggd to light and placed them full before me
And what I scarce dared harbour een in thought
Thou speakest plainly out with fearless tongue
But hast thou weighd well what thou urgest thus
Discord will come and the fierce clang of arms
To scare this valleys long unbroken peace
If we a feeble shepherd race shall dare
Him to the fight that lords it oer the world
Evn now they only wait some fair pretext
For setting loose their savage warrior hordes
To scourge and ravage this devoted land
To lord it oer us with the victors rights
And neath the show of lawful chastisement
Despoil us of our chartered liberties

GERT
You too are men can wield a battle axe
As well as they God neer deserts the brave

STAUFF
Oh wife a horrid ruthless fiend is war
That smites at once the shepherd and his flock

GERT
Whateer great Heaven inflicts we must endure
But wrong is what no noble heart will bear

STAUFF
This housethy pridewar unrelenting war
Will burn it down

GERT
And did I think this heart
Enslaved and fettered to the things of earth
With my own hand Id hurl the kindling torch

STAUFF
Thou hast faith in human kindness wife but war
Spares not the tender infant in its cradle

GERT
There is a Friend to innocence in heaven
Send your gaze forward Wernernot behind

STAUFF
We men may die like men with sword in hand
But oh what fate my Gertrude may be thine

GERT
None are so weak but one last choice is left
A spring from yonder bridge and I am free

STAUFF embracing her
Well may he fight for hearth and home that clasps
A heart so rare as thine against his own
What are the host of emperors to him
Gertrude farewell I will to Uri straight
There lives my worthy comrade Walter Furst
His thoughts and mine upon these times are one
There too resides the noble Banneret
Of Attinghaus High though of blood he be
He loves the people honours their old customs
With both of these I will take counsel how
To rid us bravely of our countrys foe
Farewell and while I am away bear thou
A watchful eye in management at home
The pilgrim journeying to the house of God
And holy friar collecting for his cloister
To these give liberally from purse and garner
Stauffachers house would not be hid Right out
Upon the public way it stands and offers
To all that pass a hospitable roof

While they are retiring Tell enters with Baumgarten

TELL
Now then you have no further need of me
Enter yon house Tis Werner Stauffachers
A man that is a father to distress
See there he is himself Come follow me

They retire up Scene changes


SCENE III

A common near Altdorf On an eminence in the background a castle in
progress of erection and so far advanced that the outline of the
whole may be distinguished The back part is finished men are working
at the front Scaffolding on which the workmen are going up and down
A slater is seen upon the highest part of the roof All is bustle and
activity

Taskmaster Mason Workmen and Labourers


TASK with a stick urging on the workmen
Up up
Youve rested long enough To work
The stones here Now the mortar and the lime
And let his lordship see the work advanced
When next he comes These fellows crawl like snails

To two labourers with loads

What call ye that a load Go double it
Is this the way ye earn your wages laggards

1ST W
Tis very hard that we must bear the stones
To make a keep and dungeon for ourselves

TASK
Whats that you mutter Tis a worthless race
For nothing fit but just to milk their cows
And saunter idly up and down the hills

OLD MAN sinks down exhausted
I can no more

TASK shaking him
Up up old man to work

1ST W
Have you no bowels of compassion thus
To press so hard upon a poor old man
That scarce can drag his feeble limbs along

MASTER MASON and WORKMEN
Shame shame upon youshame It cries to heaven

TASK

1ST W
Pray master whats to be the name of this
Same castle when tis built

TASK
The Keep of Uri
For by it we shall keep you in subjection

WORK
The Keep of Uri

TASK
Well why laugh at that

2ND W
Keep Uri will you with this paltry place

1ST W
How many molehills such as that must first
Be piled up each on each ere you make
A mountain equal to the least in Uri

Taskmaster retires up the stage

MAS M
Ill drown the mallet in the deepest lake
That served my hand on this accursed pile

Enter Tell and Stauffacher

STAUFF
O that I had not lived to see this sight

TELL
Here tis not good to be Let us proceed

STAUFF

MAS M
O sir if you could only see the vaults
Beneath these towers The man that tenants them
Will neer hear cock crow more

STAUFF
O God O God

MASON
Look at these ramparts and these buttresses
That seem as they were built to last for ever

TELL
What hands have built my friend hands can destroy

Pointing to the mountains

That home of freedom God hath built for us

A drum is heard People enter bearing a cap upon a pole followed by
a crier Women and children thronging tumultuously after them

1ST W
What means the drum Give heed

MASON
Why heres a mumming
And look the capwhat can they mean by that

CRIER
In the Emperors name give ear

WORK
Hush silence hush

CRIER
Ye men of Uri ye do see this cap
It will be set upon a lofty pole
In Altdorf in the market place and this
Is the Lord Governors good will and pleasure
The cap shall have like honour as himself
All do it reverence with bended knee
And head uncovered thus the king will know
Who are his true and loyal subjects here
His life and goods are forfeit to the crown
That shall refuse obedience to the order

The people burst out into laughter The drum beats and the procession
passes on

1ST W
A strange device to fall upon indeed
Do reverence to a cap A pretty farce
Heard ever mortal anything like this

MAS M
Down to a cap on bended knee forsooth
Rare jesting this with men of sober sense

1ST W
Nay an it were the imperial crown A cap
Merely the cap of Austria Ive seen it
Hanging above the throne in Gesslers hall

MASON
The cap of Austria Mark that A snare
To get us into Austrias power by Heaven

WORK

MAS M

They retire up

TELL to Stauffacher

STAUFF
Whither away Oh leave us not so soon

TELL
They look for me at home So fare ye well

STAUFF
My hearts so full and has so much to tell you

TELL
Words will not make a heart thats heavy light

STAUFF
Yet words may possibly conduct to deeds

TELL
Endure in silence We can do no more

STAUFF
But shall we bear what is not to be borne

TELL
Impetuous rulers have the shortest reigns
When the fierce Southwind rises from its chasms
Men cover up their fires the ships in haste
Make for the harbour and the mighty spirit
Sweeps oer the earth and leaves no trace behind
Let every man live quietly at home
Peace to the peaceful rarely is denied

STAUFF
And is it thus you view our grievances

TELL
The serpent stings not till it is provoked
Let them alone theyll weary of themselves
When they shall see we are not to be roused

STAUFF
Much might be donedid we stand fast together

TELL
When the ship founders he will best escape
Who seeks no others safety but his own

STAUFF
And you desert the common cause so coldly

TELL
A man can safely count but on himself

STAUFF
Nay even the weak grow strong by union

TELL
But the strong man is strongest when alone

STAUFF
So then your country cannot count on you
If in despair she rise against her foes

TELL
Tell rescues the lost sheep from yawning gulfs
Is he a man then to desert his friends
Yet whatsoeer you do spare me from council
I was not born to ponder and select
But when your course of action is resolved
Then call on Tell you shall not find him fail

Exeunt severally A sudden tumult is heard around the scaffolding

MASON running in
Whats wrong

FIRST WORKMAN running forward
The slaters fallen from the roof

BERTHA rushing in
Heavens Is he dashed to pieces
Save him help
If help be possible save him Here is gold

Throws her trinkets among the people

MASON
Hence with your goldyour universal charm
And remedy for ill When you have torn
Fathers from children husbands from their wives
And scattered woe and wail throughout the land
You think with gold to compensate for all
Hence Till we saw you we were happy men
With you came misery and dark despair

BERTHA to the Taskmaster who has returned
Lives he

Taskmaster shakes his head

Illomened towers with curses built
And doomed with curses to be tenanted

Exit


SCENE IV

The House of Walter Furst Walter Furst and Arnold von Melchthal enter
simultaneously at different sides


MELCH
Good Walter Furst

FURST
If we should be surprised
Stay where you are We are beset with spies

MELCH
Have you no news for me from Unterwald
What of my father Tis not to be borne
Thus to be pent up like a felon here
What have I done so heinous that I must
Skulk here in hiding like a murderer
I only laid my staff across the fists
Of the pert varlet when before my eyes
By order of the governor he tried
To drive away my handsome team of oxen

FURST
You are too rash by far He did no more
Than what the Governor had ordered him
You had transgressd and therefore should have paid
The penalty however hard in silence

MELCH
Was I to brook the fellows saucy gibe
That if the peasant must have bread to eat
Why let him go and draw the plough himself
It cut me to the very soul to see
My oxen noble creatures when the knave
Unyoked them from the plough As though they felt
The wrong they lowed and butted with their horns
On this I could contain myself no longer
And overcome by passion struck him down

FURST
O we old men can scarce command ourselves
And can we wonder youth breaks out of bounds

MELCH
Im only sorry for my fathers sake
To be away from him that needs so much
My fostering care The Governor detests him
Because wheneer occasion served he has
Stood stoutly up for right and liberty
Therefore theyll bear him hardthe poor old man
And there is none to shield him from their gripe
Come what come may I must go home again

FURST
Compose yourself and wait in patience till
We get some tidings oer from Unterwald
Away away I hear a knock Perhaps
A message from the Viceroy Get thee in
You are not safe from Landenbergers arm
In Uri for these tyrants pull together

 Berenger von Landenberg a man of noble family in Thurgau and
 Governor of Unterwald infamous for his cruelties to the Swiss
 and particularly to the venerable Henry of the Halden He was
 slain at the battle of Morgarten in 1315

MELCH
They teach us Switzers what we ought to do

FURST
Away Ill call you when the coast is clear

Melchthal retires

Unhappy youth I dare not tell him all
The evil that my boding heart predicts
Whos there The door neer opens but I look
For tidings of mishap Suspicion lurks
With darkling treachery in every nook
Even to our inmost rooms they force their way
These myrmidons of power and soon well need
To fasten bolts and bars upon our doors

He opens the door and steps back in surprise as Werner Stauffacher
enters

What do I see You Werner Now by Heaven
A valued guest indeed No man eer set
His foot across this threshold more esteemd
Welcome thrice welcome Werner to my roof
What brings you here What seek you here in Uri

STAUFF shakes Furst by the hand
The olden times and olden Switzerland

FURST
You bring them with you See how glad I am
My heart leaps at the very sight of you
Sit downsit down and tell me how you left
Your charming wife fair Gertrude Ibergs child
And clever as her father Not a man
That wends from Germany by Meinrads Cell
To Italy but praises far and wide
Your houses hospitality But say
Have you come here direct from Fluelen
And have you noticed nothing on your way
Before you halted at my door

 A cell built in the 9th century by Meinrad Count of
 Hohenzollern the founder of the Convent of Einsiedeln
 subsequently alluded to in the text

STAUFF sits down
I saw
A work in progress as I came along
I little thought to seethat likes me ill

FURST
O friend youve lighted on my thought at once

STAUFF
Such things in Uri neer were known before
Never was prison here in mans remembrance
Nor ever any stronghold but the grave

FURST
You name it well It is the grave of freedom

STAUFF
Friend Walter Furst I will be plain with you
No idle curiosity it is
That brings me here but heavy cares I left
Thraldom at home and thraldom meets me here
Our wrongs een now are more than we can bear
And who shall tell us where they are to end
From eldest time the Switzer has been free
Accustomd only to the mildest rule
Such things as now we suffer neer were known
Since herdsman first drove cattle to the hills

FURST
Yes our oppressions are unparalleld
Why even our own good lord of Attinghaus
Who lived in olden times himself declares
They are no longer to be tamely borne

STAUFF
In Unterwalden yonder tis the same
And bloody has the retribution been
The imperial Seneschal the Wolfshot who
At Rossberg dwelt longd for forbidden fruit
Baumgartens wife that lives at Alzellen
He tried to make a victim to his lust
On which the husband slew him with his axe

FURST
O Heaven is just in all its judgments still
Baumgarten say you A most worthy man
Has he escaped and is he safely hid

STAUFF
Your soninlaw conveyed him oer the lake
And he lies hidden in my house at Steinen
He brought the tidings with him of a thing
That has been done at Sarnen worse than all
A thing to make the very heart run blood

FURST attentively
Say on What is it

STAUFF
There dwells in Melchthal then
Just as you enter by the road from Kerns
An upright man named Henry of the Halden
A man of weight and influence in the Diet

FURST
Who knows him not But what of him Proceed

STAUFF
The Landenberg to punish some offence
Committed by the old mans son it seems
Had given command to take the youths best pair
Of oxen from his plough on which the lad
Struck down the messenger and took to flight

FURST
But the old fathertell me what of him

STAUFF
The Landenberg sent for him and required
He should produce his son upon the spot
And when the old man protested and with truth
That he knew nothing of the fugitive
The tyrant calld his torturers

FURST springs up and tries to lead him to the other side
Hush no more

STAUFF with increasing warmth
And though thy son he cried has scaped me now
I have thee fast and thou shalt feel my vengeance
With that they flung the old man to the ground
And plunged the pointed steel into his eyes

FURST
Merciful Heaven

MELCH rushing out
Into his eyes his eyes

STAUFF addresses himself in astonishment to Walter Furst
Who is this youth

MELCH grasping him convulsively
Into his eyes Speak speak

FURST
Oh miserable hour

STAUFF
Who is it tell me

Stauffacher makes a sign to him

It is his son Allrighteous Heaven

MELCH
And I
Must be from thence What Into both his eyes

FURST
Be calm be calm and bear it like a man

MELCH
And all for me for my mad willful folly
Blind did you say Quite blindand both his eyes

STAUFF
Evn so The fountain of his sight is quenchd
He neer will see the blessed sunshine more

FURST
Oh spare his anguish

MELCH
Never never more

Presses his hands upon his eyes and is silent for some moments then
turning from one to the other speaks in a subdued tone broken by
sobs

O the eyes light of all the gifts of Heaven
The dearest best From light all beings live
Each fair created thingthe very plants
Turn with a joyful transport to the light
And hehe must drag on through all his days
In endless darkness Never more for him
The sunny meads shall glow the flowrets bloom
Nor shall he more behold the roseate tints
Of the iced mountain top To die is nothing
But to have life and not have sightoh that
Is misery indeed Why do you look
So piteously at me I have two eyes
Yet to my poor blind father can give neither
No not one gleam of that great sea of light
That with its dazzling splendour floods my gaze

STAUFF
Ah I must swell the measure of your grief
Instead of soothing it The worst alas
Remains to tell Theyve strippd him of his all
Nought have they left him save his staff on which
Blind and in rags he moves from door to door

MELCH
Nought but his staff to the old eyeless man
Strippd of his alleven of the light of day
The common blessing of the meanest wretch
Tell me no more of patience of concealment
Oh what a base and coward thing am I
That on mine own security I thought
And took no care of thine Thy precious head
Left as a pledge within the tyrants grasp
Hence cravenhearted prudence hence And all
My thoughts be vengeance and the despots blood
Ill seek him straightno power shall stay me now
And at his hands demand my fathers eyes
Ill beard him mid a thousand myrmidons
Whats life to me if in his hearts best blood
I cool the fever of this mighty anguish

He is going

FURST
Stay this is madness Melchthal What avails
Your single arm against his power He sits
At Sarnen high within his lordly keep
And safe within its battlemented walls
May laugh to scorn your unavailing rage

MELCH
And though he sat within the icy domes
Of yon far Schreckhornay or higher where
Veild since eternity the Jungfrau soars
Still to the tyrant would I make my way
With twenty comrades minded like myself
Id lay his fastness level with the earth
And if none follow me and if you all
In terror for your homesteads and your herds
Bow in submission to the tyrants yoke
Round me Ill call the herdsmen on the hills
And there beneath heavens free and boundless roof
Where men still feel as men and hearts are true
Proclaim aloud this foul enormity

STAUFF to Furst
The measures fulland are we then to wait
Till some extremity

MELCH
Peace What extremity
Remains for us to dread What when our eyes
No longer in their sockets are secure
Heavens Are we helpless Wherefore did we learn
To bend the crossbowwield the battleaxe
What living creature but in its despair
Finds for itself a weapon of defence
The baited stag will turn and with the show
Of his dread antlers hold the hounds at bay
The chamois drags the hunstman down th abyss
The very ox the partner of mans toil
The sharer of his roof that meekly bends
The strength of his huge neck beneath the yoke
Springs up if hes provoked whets his strong horn
And tosses his tormentor to the clouds

FURST
If the three Cantons thought as we three do
Something might then be done with good effect

STAUFF
When Uri calls when Unterwald replies
Schwytz will be mindful of her ancient league

 The League or Bond of the Three Cantons was of very ancient
 origin They met and renewed it from time to time especially when
 their liberties were threatened with danger A remarkable instance
 of this occurred in the end of the 13th century when Albert of
 Austria became Emperor and when possibly for the first time
 the Bond was reduced to writing As it is important to the
 understanding of many passages of the play a translation is
 subjoined of the oldest known document relating to it The
 original which is in Latin and German is dated in August 1291
 and is under the seals of the whole of the men of Schwytz the
 commonalty of the vale of Uri and the whole of the men of the
 upper and lower vales of Stanz

THE BOND

 Be it known to every one that the men of the Dale of Uri the
 Community of Schwytz as also the men of the mountains of
 Unterwald in consideration of the evil times have full
 confidently bound themselves and sworn to help each other with
 all their power and might property and people against all who
 shall do violence to them or any of them That is our Ancient
 Bond

 Whoever hath a Seignior let him obey according to the conditions
 of his service

 We are agreed to receive into these dales no Judge who is not a
 countryman and indweller or who hath bought his place

 Every controversy amongst the sworn confederates shall be
 determined by some of the sagest of their number and if any one
 shall challenge their judgment then shall he be constrained to
 obey it by the rest

 Whoever intentionally or deceitfully kills another shall be
 executed and whoever shelters him shall be banished

 Whoever burns the property of another shall no longer be regarded
 as a countryman and whoever shelters him shall make good the
 damage done

 Whoever injures another or robs him and hath property in our
 country shall make satisfaction out of the same

 No one shall distrain a debtor without a judge nor any one who is
 not his debtor or the surety of such debtor

 Every one in these dales shall submit to the judge or we the
 sworn confederates all will take satisfaction for all the injury
 occasioned by his contumacy And if in any internal division the
 one party will not accept justice all the rest shall help the
 other party These decrees shall God willing endure eternally
 for our general advantage

MELCH
Ive many friends in Unterwald and none
That would not gladly venture life and limb
If fairly backd and aided by the rest
Oh sage and reverend fathers of this land
Here do I stand before your riper years
An unskilld youth who in the Diet must
Into respectful silence hush his voice
Yet do not for that I am young and want
Experience slight my counsel and my words
Tis not the wantonness of youthful blood
That fires my spirit but a pang so deep
That een the flinty rocks must pity me
You too are fathers heads of families
And you must wish to have a virtuous son
To reverence your grey hairs and shield your eyes
With pious and affectionate regard
Do not I pray because in limb and fortune
You still are unassailed and still your eyes
Revolve undimmd and sparkling in their spheres
Oh do not therefore disregard our wrongs
Above you also hangs the tyrants sword
You too have striven to alienate the land
From Austria This was all my fathers crime
You share his guilt and may his punishment

STAUFF to Furst
Do thou resolve I am prepared to follow

FURST
First let us learn what steps the noble lords
Von Sillinen and Attinghaus propose
Their names would rally thousands to the cause

MELCH
Is there a name within the Forest Mountains
That carried more respect than yoursand yours
On names like these the people build their trust
In time of needsuch names are household words
Rich was your heritage of manly worth
And richly have you added to its stores
What need of nobles Let us do the work
Ourselves Yes though we have to stand alone
We shall be able to maintain our rights

STAUFF
The nobles wrongs are not so great as ours
The torrent that lays waste the lower grounds
Hath not ascended to the uplands yet
But let them see the country once in arms
Theyll not refuse to lend a helping hand

FURST
Were there an umpire twixt ourselves and Austria
Justice and law might then decide our quarrel
But out oppressor is our Emperor too
And judge supreme Tis God must help us then
And our own arm Be yours the task to rouse
The men of Schwytz Ill rally friends in Uri
But whom are we to send to Unterwald

MELCH
Thither send me Whom should it more concern

FURST
No Melchthal no you are my guest and I
Must answer for your safety

MELCH
Let me go I know each forest track and mountain path
Friends too Ill find be sure on every hand
To give me willing shelter from the foe

STAUFF
Nay let him go no traitors harbour there
For tyranny is so abhorred in Unterwald
No tools can there be found to work her will
In the low valleys too the Alzeller
Will gain confederates and rouse the country

MELCH
But how shall we communicate and not
Awaken the suspicion of the tyrants

STAUFF
Might we not meet at Brunnen or at Treib
Where merchant vessels with their cargoes come

FURST
We must not go so openly to work
Hear my opinion On the lakes left bank
As we sail hence to Brunnen right against
The Mytenstein deephidden in the wood
A meadow lies by shepherds called the Rootli
Because the wood has been uprooted there

To Melchthal

Tis where our Canton boundries verge on yours

To Stauffacher

Your boat will carry you across from Schwytz

Thither by lonely bypaths let us wend
At midnight and deliberate oer our plans
Let each bring with him there ten trusty men
All one at heart with us and then we may
Consult together for the general weal
And with Gods guidance fix what next to do

STAUFF
So let it be And now your true right hand
Yours too young man and as we now three men
Among ourselves thus knit our hands together
In all sincerity and truth een so
Shall we three cantons too together stand
In victory and defeat in life and death

FURST and MELCH
In life and death

They hold their hands clasped together for some moments in silence

MELCH
Alas my old blind father
The day of freedom that thou canst not see
But thou shalt hear it when from Alp to Alp
The beacon fires throw up their flaming signs
And the proud castles of the tyrants fall
Into thy cottage shall the Switzer burst
Bear the glad tidings to thine ear and oer
Thy darkend way shall Freedoms radiance pour



ACT II


SCENE I

The mansion of the Baron of Attinghausen A Gothic Hall decorated
with escutcheons and helmets The Baron a greyheaded man eighty
five years old tall and of a commanding mien clad in a furred
pelisse and leaning on a staff tipped with chamois horn Kuoni and
six hinds standing round him with rakes and scythes Ulrich of Rudenz
enters in the costume of a knight


RUD
Uncle Im here Your will

ATTING
First let me share
After the ancient custom of our house
The morning cup with these my faithful servants

He drinks from a cup which is then passed round

Time was I stood myself in field and wood
With mine own eyes directing all their toil
Even as my banner led them in the fight
Now I am only fit to play the steward
And if the genial sun come not to me
I can no longer seek it on the hills
Thus slowly in an evernarrowing sphere
I move on to the narrowest and the last
Where all lifes pulses cease I now am but
The shadow of my former self and that
Is fading fasttwill soon be but a name

KUONI offering Rudenz the cup
A pledge young master

Rudenz hesitates to take the cup

Nay Sir drink it off
One cup one heart You know our proverb Sir

ATTING
Go children and at eve when work is done
Well meet and talk the countrys business over

Exeunt servants

Belted and plumed and all thy bravery on
Thou art for Altdorffor the castle boy

RUD
Yes uncle Longer may I not delay

ATTING sitting down
Why in such haste Say are thy youthful hours
Doled in such niggard measure that thou must
Be chary of them to thy aged uncle

RUD
I see my presence is not needed here
I am but as a stranger in this house

ATTING gazes fixedly at him for a considerable time
Ay pity tis thou art Alas that home
To thee has grown so strange Oh Uly Uly
I scarce do know thee now thus deckd in silks
The peacocks feather flaunting in thy cap
And purple mantle round thy shoulders flung
Thou lookst upon the peasant with disdain
And takst his honest greeting with a blush

 The Austrian knights were in the habit of wearing a plume of
 peacocks feathers in their helmets After the overthrow of the
 Austrian dominion in Switzerland it was made highly penal to wear
 the peacocks feather at any public assembly there

RUD
All honour due to him I gladly pay
But must deny the right he would usurp

ATTING
The sore displeasure of its monarch rests
Upon our land and every true mans heart
Is full of sadness for the grievous wrongs
We suffer from our tyrants Thou alone
Art all unmoved amid the general grief
Abandoning thy friends thou takst thy stand
Beside thy countrys foes and as in scorn
Of our distress pursuest giddy joys
Courting the smiles of princes all the while
Thy country bleeds beneath their cruel scourge

RUD
The land is sore oppressd I know it uncle
But why Who plunged it into this distress
A word one little easy word might buy
Instant deliverance from all our ills
And win the good will of the Emperor
Woe unto those who seal the peoples eyes
And make them adverse to their countrys good
The men who for their own vile selfish ends
Are seeking to prevent the Forest States
From swearing fealty to Austrias House
As all the countries round about have done
It fits their humour well to take their seats
Amid the nobles on the Herrenbank
Theyll have the Kaiser for their lord forsooth
That is to say theyll have no lord at all

 The bench reserved for the nobility

ATTING
Must I hear this and from thy lips rash boy

RUD
You urged me to this answer Hear me out
What uncle is the character youve stoopd
To fill contentedly through life Have you
No higher pride than in these lonely wilds
To be the Landamman or Banneret
The petty chieftain of a shepherd race How
Were it not a far more glorious choice
To bend in homage to our royal lord
And swell the princely splendours of his court
Than sit at home the peer of your own vassals
And share the judgmentseat with vulgar clowns

 The Landamman was an officer chosen by the Swiss Gemeinde or
 Diet to preside over them The Banneret was an officer entrusted
 with the keeping of the State Banner and such others as were
 taken in battle

ATTING
Ah Uly Uly all too well I see
The tempters voice has caught thy willing ear
And pourd its subtle poison in thy heart

RUD
Yes I conceal it not It doth offend
My inmost soul to hear the strangers gibes
That taunt us with the name of Peasant Nobles
Think you the heart thats stirring here can brook
While all the young nobility around
Are reaping honour under Hapsburgs banner
That I should loiter in inglorious ease
Here on the heritage my fathers left
And in the dull routine of vulgar toil
Lose all lifes glorious spring In other lands
Great deeds are done A world of fair renown
Beyond these mountains stirs in martial pomp
My helm and shield are rusting in the hall
The martial trumpets spiritstirring blast
The heralds call inviting to the lists
Rouse not the echoes of these vales where nought
Save cowherds horn and cattle bell is heard
In one unvarying dull monotony

ATTING
Deluded boy seduced by empty show
Despise the land that gave thee birth Ashamed
Of the good ancient customs of thy sires
The day will come when thou with burning tears
Wilt long for home and for thy native hills
And that dear melody of tuneful herds
Which now in proud disgust thou dost despise
A day when wistful pangs shall shake thy heart
Hearing their music in a foreign land
Oh potent is the spell that binds to home
No no the cold false world is not for thee
At the proud court with thy true heart thou wilt
For ever feel a stranger among strangers
The world asks virtues of far other stamp
Than thou hast learned within these simple vales
But gogo thitherbarter thy free soul
Take land in fief be minion to a prince
Where thou mightst be lord paramount and prince
Of all thine own unburdend heritage
O Uly Uly stay among thy people
Go not to Altdorf Oh abandon not
The sacred cause of thy wrongd native land
I am the last of all my race My name
Ends with me Yonder hang my helm and shield
They will be buried with me in the grave
And must I think when yielding up my breath
That thou but waitst the closing of mine eyes
To stoop thy knee to this new feudal court
And take in vassalage from Austrias hands
The noble lands which I from God received
Free and unfetterd as the mountain air

 According to the custom by which when the last male descendant
 of a noble family died his sword helmet and shield were buried
 with him

RUD
Tis vain for us to strive against the king
The world pertains to himshall we alone
In mad presumptuous obstinacy strive
To break that mighty chain of lands which he
Hath drawn around us with his giant grasp
His are the markets his the courtshis too
The highways nay the very carriers horse
That traffics on the Gotthardt pays him toll
By his dominions as within a net
We are enclosed and girded round about
And will the Empire shield us Say can it
Protect itself gainst Austrias growing power
To God and not to emperors must we look
What store can on their promises be placed
When they to meet their own necessities
Can pawn and even alienate the towns
That flee for shelter neath the Eagles wings
No uncle It is wise and wholesome prudence
In times like these when factions all abroad
To vow attachment to some mighty chief
The imperial crowns transferred from line to line
It has no memory for faithful service
But to secure the favour of these great
Hereditary masters were to sow
Seed for a future harvest

 This frequently occurred But in the event of an imperial city
 being mortgaged for the purpose of raising money it lost its
 freedom and was considered as put out of the realm

 An allusion to the circumstance of the Imperial Crown not being
 hereditary but conferred by election on one of the Counts of the
 Empire

ATTING
Art so wise
Wilt thou see clearer than thy noble sires
Who battled for fair freedoms priceless gem
With life and fortune and heroic arm
Sail down the lake to Lucerne there inquire
How Austrias thraldom weighs the Cantons down
Soon she will come to count our sheep our cattle
To portion out the Alps een to their peaks
And in our own free woods to hinder us
From striking down the eagle or the stag
To set her tolls on every bridge and gate
Impoverish us to swell her lust of sway
And drain our dearest blood to feed her wars
No if our blood must flow let it be shed
In our own cause We purchase liberty
More cheaply far than bondage

RUD
What can we
A shepherd race against great Alberts hosts

ATTING
Learn foolish boy to know this shepherd race
I know them I have led them on in fight
I saw them in the battle at Favenz
What Austria try forsooth to force on us
A yoke we are determined not to bear
Oh learn to feel from what a stock thourt sprung
Cast not for tinsel trash and idle show
The precious jewel of thy worth away
To be the chieftain of a freeborn race
Bound to thee only by their unbought love
Ready to standto fightto die with thee
Be that thy pride be that thy noblest boast
Knit to thy heart the ties of kindredhome
Cling to the land the dear land of thy sires
Grapple to that with thy whole heart and soul
Thy power is rooted deep and strongly here
But in yon stranger world thoult stand alone
A trembling reed beat down by every blast
Oh come tis long since we have seen thee Uly
Tarry but this one day Only today
Go not to Altdorf Wilt thou Not today
For this one day bestow thee on thy friends

Takes his hand

RUD
I gave my word Unhand me I am bound

ATTING drops his hand and says sternly
Bound didst thou say Oh yes unhappy boy
Thou art indeed But not by word or oath
Tis by the silken mesh of love thourt bound

Rudenz turns away

Ah hide thee as thou wilt Tis she
I know Bertha of Bruneck draws thee to the court
Tis she that chains thee to the Emperors service
Thou thinkst to win the noble knightly maid
By thy apostasy Be not deceived
She is held out before thee as a lure
But never meant for innocence like thine

RUD
No more Ive heard enough So fare you well

Exit

ATTING
Stay Uly Stay Rash boy hes gone I can
Nor hold him back nor save him from destruction
And so the Wolfshot has deserted us
Others will follow his example soon
This foreign witchery sweeping oer our hills
Tears with its potent spell our youth away
O luckless hour when men and manners strange
Into these calm and happy valleys came
To warp our primitive and guileless ways
The new is pressing on with might The old
The good the simple all flee fast away
New times come on A race is springing up
That think not as their fathers thought before
What do I hear All all are in the grave
With whom erewhile I moved and held converse
My age has long been laid beneath the sod
Happy the man who may not live to see
What shall be done by those that follow me


SCENE II

A meadow surrounded by high rocks and wooded ground On the rocks are
tracks with rails and ladders by which the peasants are afterwards
seen descending In the background the lake is observed and over it
a moon rainbow in the early part of the scene The prospect is closed
by lofty mountains with glaciers rising behind them The stage is
dark but the lake and glaciers glisten in the moonlight

Melchthal Baumgarten Winkelried Meyer von Sarnen Burkhart am
Buhel Arnold von Sewa Klaus von der Flue and four other peasants
all armed


MELCHTHAL behind the scenes
The mountain pass is open Follow me
I see the rock and little cross upon it
This is the spot here is the Rootli

They enter with torches

WINK
Hark

SEWA
The coast is clear

MEYER
None of our comrades come
We are the first we Unterwaldeners

MELCH
How far ist i the night

BAUM
The beacon watch
Upon the Selisberg has just called two

A bell is heard at a distance

MEYER
Hush Hark

BUHEL
The forest chapels matin bell
Chimes clearly oer the lake from Switzerland

VON F
The air is clear and bears the sound so far

MELCH
Go you and you and light some broken boughs
Lets bid them welcome with a cheerful blaze

Two peasants exeunt

SEWA
The moon shines fair tonight Beneath its beams
The lake reposes bright as burnishd steel

BUHEL
Theyll have an easy passage

WINK pointing to the lake
Ha look there
Do you see nothing

MEYER
Ay indeed I do
A rainbow in the middle of the night

MELCH
Formed by the bright reflection of the moon

VON F
A sign most strange and wonderful indeed
Many there be who neer have seen the like

SEWA
Tis doubled see a paler one above

BAUM
A boat is gliding yonder right beneath it

MELCH
That must be Werner Stauffacher I knew
The worthy patriot would not tarry long

Goes with Baumgarten towards the shore

MEYER
The Uri men are like to be the last

BUHEL
Theyre forced to take a winding circuit through
The mountains for the Viceroys spies are out

In the meanwhile the two peasants have kindled a fire in the centre
of the stage

MELCH on the shore
Whos there The word

STAUFF from below
Friends of the country

All retire up the stage towards the party landing from the boat
Enter Stauffacher Itel Reding Hans auf der Mauer Jorg im Hofe
Conrad Hunn Ulrich der Schmidt Jost von Weiler and three other
peasants armed

ALL
Welcome

While the rest remain behind exchanging greetings Melchthal comes
forward with Stauffacher

MELCH
Oh worthy Stauffacher Ive lookd but now
On him who could not look on me again
Ive laid my hands upon his rayless eyes
And on their vacant orbits sworn a vow
Of vengeance only to be coold in blood

STAUFF
Speak not of vengeance We are here to meet
The threatened evil not to avenge the past
Now tell me what youve done and what secured
To aid the common cause in Unterwald
How stand the peasantry disposed and how
Yourself escaped the wiles of treachery

MELCH
Through the Surenens fearful mountain chain
Where dreary icefields stretch on every side
And sound is none save the hoarse vultures cry
I reachd the Alpine pasture where the herds
From Uri and from Engelberg resort
And turn their cattle forth to graze in common
Still as I went along I slaked my thirst
With the coarse oozings of the glacier heights
that thro the crevices come foaming down
And turned to rest me in the herdsmens cots
Where I was host and guest until I gaind
The cheerful homes and social haunts of men
Already through these distant vales had spread
The rumour of this last atrocity
And wheresoeer I went at every door
Kind words saluted me and gentle looks
I found these simple spirits all in arms
Against our rulers tyrannous encroachments
For as their Alps through each succeeding year
Yield the same rootstheir streams flow ever on
In the same channelsnay the clouds and winds
The selfsame course unalterably pursue
So have old customs there from sire to son
Been handed down unchanging and unchanged
Nor will they brook to swerve or turn aside
From the fixed even tenor of their life
With grasp of their hard hands they welcomed me
Took from the walls their rusty falchions down
And from their eyes the soul of valour flashd
With joyful lustre as I spoke those names
Sacred to every peasant in the mountains
Your own and Walter Fursts Whateer your voice
Should dictate as the right they swore to do
And you they swore to follow een to death
So sped I on from house to house secure
In the guests sacred privilegeand when
I reached at last the valley of my home
Where dwell my kinsmen scatterd far and near
And when I found my father stript and blind
Upon the strangers straw fed by the alms
Of charity

STAUFF
Great Heaven

MELCH
Yet wept I not
Nonot in weak and unavailing tears
Spent I the force of my fierce burning anguish
Deep in my bosom like some precious treasure
I lockd it fast and thought on deeds alone
Through every winding of the hills I crept
No valley so remote but I explored it
Nay at the very glaciers iceclad base
I sought and found the homes of living men
And still whereer my wandering footsteps turnd
The selfsame hatred of these tyrants met me
For even there at vegetations verge
Where the numbd earth is barren of all fruits
Their grasping hands had been for plunder thrust
Into the hearts of all this honest race
The story of my wrongs struck deep and now
They to a man are ours both heart and hand

STAUFF
Great things indeed youve wrought in little time

MELCH
I did still more than this The fortresses
Rossberg and Sarnen are the countrys dread
For from behind their adamantine walls
The foe like eagle from his eyrie swoops
And safe himself spreads havoc oer the land
With my own eyes I wishd to weigh its strength
So went to Sarnen and explored the castle

STAUFF
How Venture even into the tigers den

MELCH
Disguised in pilgrims weeds I entered it
I saw the Viceroy feasting at his board
Judge if Im master of myself or no
I saw the tyrant and I slew him not

STAUFF
Fortune indeed upon your boldness smiled

Meanwhile the others have arrived and join Melchthal and
Stauffacher

Yet tell me now I pray who are the friends
The worthy men who came along with you
Make me acquainted with them that we may
Speak frankly man to man and heart to heart

MEYER
In the three Cantons who sir knows not you
Meyer of Sarnen is my name and this
Is Struth of Winkelried my sisters son

STAUFF
No unknown name A Winkelried it was
Who slew the dragon in the fen at Weiler
And lost his life in the encounter too

WINK
That Master Stauffacher was my grandfather

MELCH pointing to two peasants
These two are men who till the cloister lands
Of Engelberg and live behind the forest
Youll not think ill of them because theyre serfs
And sit not free upon the soil like us
They love the land and bear a good repute

STAUFF to them
Give me your hands He has good cause for thanks
That to no man his bodys service owes
But worth is worth no matter where tis found

HUNN
That is Herr Reding sir our old Landamman

MEYER
I know him well I am at law with him
About a piece of ancient heritage
Herr Reding we are enemies in court
Here we are one

Shakes his hand

STAUFF
Thats well and bravely said

WINK
Listen They come The horn of Uri Hark

On the right and left armed men are seen descending the rocks with
torches

MAUER
Look is not that the holy man of God
A worthy priest The terrors of the night
And the ways pains and perils scare not him
A faithful shepherd caring for his flock

BAUM
The Sacrist follows him and Walter Furst
But where is Tell I do not see him there

Walter Furst Rosselmann the Pastor Petermann the Sacrist Kuoni the
Shepherd Werni the Huntsman Ruodi the Fisherman and five other
countrymen thirtythree in all advance and take their places round
the fire

FURST
Thus must we on the soil our fathers left us
Creep forth by stealth to meet like murderers
And in the night that should her mantle lend
Only to crime and black conspiracy
Assert our own good rights which yet are clear
As is the radiance of the noonday sun

MELCH
So be it What is hatchd in gloom of night
Shall free and boldly meet the morning light

ROSSEL
Confederates Listen to the words which God
Inspires my heart withal Here we are met
To represent the general weal In us
Are all the people of the land convened
Then let us hold the Diet as of old
And as were wont in peaceful times to do
The times necessity be our excuse
If there be aught informal in this meeting
Still wheresoeer men strike for justice there
Is God and now beneath His heavn we stand

STAUFF
Tis well advisedLet us then hold the Diet
According to our ancient usages
Though it be night theres sunshine in our cause

MELCH
Few though our numbers be the hearts are here
Of the whole people here the BEST are met

HUNN
The ancient books may not be near at hand
Yet are they graven in our inmost hearts

ROSSEL
Tis well And now then let a ring be formed
And plant the swords of power within the ground

 It was the custom at the Meetings of the Landes Gemeinde or Diet
 to set swords upright in the ground as emblems of authority

MAUER
Let the Landamman step into his place
And by his side his secretaries stand

SACRIST
There are three Cantons here Which hath the right
To give the head to the united Council
Schwytz may contest that dignity with Uri
We Unterwaldners enter not the field

MELCH
We stand aside We are but suppliants here
Invoking aid from our more potent friends

STAUFF
Let Uri have the sword Her banner takes
In battle the precedence of our own

FURST
Schwytz then must share the honour of the sword
For shes the honoured ancestor of all

ROSSEL
Let me arrange this generous controversy
Uri shall lead in battleSchwytz in Council

FURST gives Stauffacher his hand
Then take your place

STAUFF
Not I Some older man

HOFE
Ulrich the smith is the most aged here

MAUER
A worthy man but not a freeman no
No bondman can be judge in Switzerland

STAUFF
Is not Herr Reding here our old Landamman
Where can we find a worthier man than he

FURST
Let him be Amman and the Diets chief
You that agree with me hold up your hands

All hold up their right hands

REDING stepping into the center
I cannot lay my hands upon the books
But by yon everlasting stars I swear
Never to swerve from justice and the right

The two swords are placed before him and a circle formed Schwytz in
the centre Uri on his right Unterwald on his left

REDING resting on his battle sword
Why at the hour when spirits walks the earth
Meet the three Cantons of the mountains here
Upon the lakes inhospitable shore
What may the purport be of this new league
We here contract beneath the starry heaven

STAUFF entering the circle
Tis no new league that here we now contract
But one fathers framed in ancient times
We purpose to renew For know confederates
Though mountain ridge and lake divide our bounds
And each Canton by its own laws is ruled
Yet are we but one race born of one blood
And all are children of one common home

WINK
Is then the burden of our legends true
That we came hither from a distant land
Oh tell us what you know that our new league
May reap fresh vigour from the leagues of old

STAUFF
Hear then what aged herdsmen tell There dwelt
A mighty people in the land that lies
Back to the north The scourge of famine came
And in this strait twas publicly resolved
That each tenth man on whom the lot might fall
Should leave the country They obeydand forth
With loud lamentings men and women went
A mighty host and to the south moved on
Cutting their way through Germany by the sword
Until they gained these pineclad hills of ours
Nor stoppd they ever on their forward course
Till at the shaggy dell they halted where
The Muta flows through its luxuriant meads
No trace of human creature met their eye
Save one poor hut upon the desert shore
Where dwelt a lonely man and kept the ferry
A tempest ragedthe lake rose mountains high
And barrd their further progress Thereupon
They viewd the countryfound it rich in wood
Discoverd goodly springs and felt as they
Were in their own dear native land once more
Then they resolved to settle on the spot
Erected there the ancient town of Schwytz
And many a day of toil had they to clear
The tangled brake and forests spreading roots
Meanwhile their numbers grew the soil became
Unequal to sustain them and they crossd
To the black mountain far as Weissland where
Conceald behind eternal walls of ice
Another people speak another tongue
They built the village Stanz beside the Kernwald
The village Altdorf in the vale of Reuss
Yet ever mindful of their parent stem
The men of Schywtz from all the stranger race
That since that time have settled in the land
Each other recognize Their hearts still know
And beat fraternally to kindred blood

Extends his hand right and left

MAUER
Ay we are all one heart one blood one race

ALL joining hands
We are one people and will act as one

STAUFF
The nations round us bear a foreign yoke
For they have to the conqueror succumbed
Nay een within our frontiers may be found
Some that owe villein service to a lord
A race of bonded serfs from sire to son
But we the genuine race of ancient Swiss
Have kept our freedom from the first till now
Never to princes have we bowd the knee
Freely we sought protection of the Empire

ROSSEL
Freely we sought itfreely it was given
Tis so set down in Emperor Fredericks charter

STAUFF
For the most free have still some feudal lord
There must be still a chief a judge supreme
To whom appeal may lie in case of strife
And therefore was it that our sires allowd
For what they had recoverd from the waste
This honour to the Emperor the lord
Of all the German and Italian soil
And like the other free men of his realm
Engaged to aid him with their swords in war
The free mans duty this alone should be
To guard the Empire that keeps guard for him

MELCH
Hes but a slave that would acknowledge more

STAUFF
They followed when the Heribann went forth
The imperial standard and they fought its battles
To Italy they marchd in arms to place
The Caesars crown upon the Emperors head
But still at home they ruled themselves in peace
By their own laws and ancient usages
The Emperors only right was to adjudge
The penalty of death he therefore named
Some mighty noble as his delegate
That had no stake or interest in the land
Who was calld in when doom was to be passd
And in the face of day pronounced decree
Clear and distinctly fearing no mans hate
What traces here that we are bondsmen Speak
If there be any can gainsay my words

 The Heribann was a muster of warriors similar to the arriere ban
 of France

HOFE
No You have spoken but the simple truth
We never stoopd beneath a tyrants yoke

STAUFF
Even to the Emperor we did not submit
When he gave judgment gainst us for the church
For when the Abbey of Einsiedlen claimed
The Alp our fathers and ourselves had grazed
And showed an ancient charter which bestowed
The land on them as being ownerless
For our existence there had been concealed
What was our answer This The grant is void
No Emperor can bestow what is our own
And if the Empire shall deny our rights
We can within our mountains right ourselves
Thus spake our fathers And shall we endure
The shame and infamy of this new yoke
And from the vassal brook what never king
Dared in his plenitude of power attempt
This soil we have created for ourselves
By the hard labour of our hands weve changed
The giant forest that was erst the haunt
Of savage bears into a home for man
Extirpated the dragons brood that wont
To rise distent with venom from the swamps
Rent the thick misty canopy that hung
Its blighting vapours on the dreary waste
Blasted the solid rock across the chasm
Thrown the firm bridge for the wayfaring man
By the possession of a thousand years
The soil is ours And shall an alien lord
Himself a vassal dare to venture here
Insult us by our own hearth firesattempt
To forge the chains of bondage for our hands
And do us shame on our own proper soil
Is there no help against such wrong as this

Great sensation among the people

Yes theres a limit to the despots power
When the oppressd for justice looks in vain
When his sore burden may no more be borne
With fearless heart he makes appeal to Heaven
And thence brings down his everlasting rights
Which there abide inalienably his
And indestructible as are the stars
Natures primaeval state returns again
Where man stands hostile to his fellow man
And if all other means shall fail his need
One last resource remainshis own good sword
Our dearest treasures call to us for aid
Against the oppressors violence we stand
For country home for wives for children here

ALL clashing their swords
Here stand we for our homes our wives and children

ROSSEL stepping into the circle
Bethink ye well before ye draw the sword
Some peaceful compromise may yet be made
Speak but one word and at your feet youll see
The men who now oppress you Take the terms
That have been often tendered you renounce
The Empire and to Austria swear allegiance

MAUER
What says the priest To Austria allegiance

BUHEL
Hearken not to him

WINK
Tis a traitors counsel His countrys foe

REDING
Peace peace confederates

SEWA
Homage to Austria after wrongs like these

FLUE
Shall Austria extort from us by force
What we denied to kindness and entreaty

MEYER
Then should we all be slaves deservedly

MAUER
Yes Let him forfeit all a Switzers rights
Who talks of yielding thus to Austrias yoke
I stand on this Landamman Let this be
The foremost of our laws

MELCH
Even so Whoeer
Shall talk of bearing Austrias yoke let him
Of all his rights and honours be despoiled
No man thenceforth receive him at his hearth

ALL raising their right hands
Agreed Be this the law

REDING After a pause
The law it is

ROSSEL
Now you are freethis law hath made you free
Never shall Austria obtain by force
What she has faild to gain by friendly suit

WEIL
On with the order of the day Proceed

REDING
Confederates Have all gentler means been tried
Perchance the Empror knows not of our wrongs
It may not be his will we suffer thus
Were it not well to make one last attempt
And lay our grievances before the throne
Ere we unsheath the sword Force is at best
A fearful thing een in a righteous cause
God only helps when man can help no more

STAUFF to Conrad Hunn
Here you can give us information Speak

HUNN
I was at Rheinfeld at the Emperors Court
Deputed by the Cantons to complain
Of the oppressions of these governors
And of our liberties the charter claim
Which each new king till now has ratified
I found the envoys there of many a town
From Suabia and the valley of the Rhine
Who all received their parchments as they wishd
And straight went home again with merry heart
But me your envoy they to the Council sent
Where I with empty cheer was soon dismissd
The Emperor at present was engaged
Some other time he would attend to us
I turnd away and passing through the hall
With heavy heart in a recess I saw
The Grand Duke John in tears and by his side
The noble lords of Wart and Tegerfeld
Who beckond me and said Redress yourselves
Expect not justice from the Emperor
Does he not plunder his own brothers child
And keep from him his just inheritance
The Duke claims his maternal property
Urging hes now of age and tis full time
That he should rule his people and estates
What is the answer made to him The King
Places a chaplet on his head Behold
The fitting ornament he cries of youth

 The Duke of Suabia who soon afterwards assassinated his uncle
 for withholding his patrimony from him

MAUER
You hear Expect not from the Emperor
Or right or justice Then redress yourselves

REDING
No other course is left us Now advise
What plan most likely to ensure success

FURST
To shake a thraldom off that we abhor
To keep our ancient rights inviolate
As we received them from our fathersthis
Not lawless innovation is our aim
Let Caesar still retain what is his due
And he that is a vassal let him pay
The service he is sworn to faithfully

MEYER
I hold my land of Austria in fief

FURST
Continue then to pay your feudal dues

WEIL
Im tenant of the lords of Rappersweil

FURST
Continue then to pay them rent and tithe

ROSSEL
Of Zurichs Abbess humble vassal I

FURST
Give to the cloister what the cloister claims

STAUFF
The Empire only is my feudal lord

FURST
What needs must be well do but nothing more
Well drive these tyrants and their minions hence
And raze their towering strongholds to the ground
Yet shed if possible no drop of blood
Let the Emperor see that we were driven to cast
The sacred duties of respect away
And when he finds we keep within our bounds
His wrath belike may yield to policy
For truly is that nation to be feard
That arms in hand is temperate in its wrath

REDING
But prithee tell us how may this be done
The enemy is armd as well as we
And rest assured he will not yield in peace

STAUFF
He will wheneer he sees us up in arms
We shall surprise him ere he is prepared

MEYER
Easily said but not so easily done
Two strongholds dominate the countrythey
Protect the foe and should the King invade us
Our task would then be dangerous indeed
Rossberg and Sarnen both must be secured
Before a sword is drawn in either Canton

STAUFF
Should we delay the foe would soon be warned
We are too numerous for secrecy

MEYER
There is no traitor in the Forest States

ROSSEL
But even zeal may heedlessly betray

FURST
Delay it longer and the keep at Altdorf
Will be completethe governor secure

MEYER
You think but of yourselves

SACRIS
You are unjust

MEYER
Unjust said you Dares Uri taunt us so

REDING
Peace on your oath

SACRIS
If Schwytz be leagued with Uri
Why then indeed we must perforce be dumb

REDING
And let me tell you in the Diets name
Your hasty spirit much disturbs the peace
Stand we not all for the same common cause

WINK
What if till Christmas we delay Tis then
The custom for the serfs to throng the castle
Bringing the Governor their annual gifts
Thus may some ten or twelve selected men
Assemble unobserved within its walls
Bearing about their persons pikes of steel
Which may be quickly mounted upon staves
For arms are not admitted to the fort
The rest can fill the neighbring wood prepared
To sally forth upon a trumpets blast
Soon as their comrades have secured the gate
And thus the castle will with ease be ours

MELCH
The Rossberg I will undertake to scale
I have a sweetheart in the garrison
Whom with some tender words I could persuade
To lower me at night a hempen ladder
Once up my friends will not be long behind

REDING
Are all resolved in favor of delay

The majority raise their hands

STAUFF counting them
Twenty to twelve is the majority

FURST
If on the appointed day the castles fall
From mountain on to mountain we shall speed
The fiery signal in the capital
Of every Canton quickly rouse the Landsturm
Then when these tyrants see our martial front
Believe me they will never make so bold
As risk the conflict but will gladly take
Safe conduct forth beyond our boundaries

 A sort of national militia

STAUFF
Not so with Gessler He will make a stand
Surrounded with his dread array of horse
Blood will be shed before he quits the field
And even expelld hed still be terrible
Tis hard nay dangerous to spare his life

BAUM
Place me whereer a life is to be lost
I owe my life to Tell and cheerfully
Will pledge it for my country I have cleard
My honour and my heart is now at rest

REDING
Counsel will come with circumstance Be patient
Something must still be to the moment left
Yet while by night we hold our Diet here
The morning see has on the mountain tops
Kindled her glowing beacon Let us part
Ere the broad sun surprise us

FURST
Do not fear
The night wanes slowly from these vales of ours

All have involuntarily taken off their caps and contemplate the
breaking of day absorbed in silence

ROSSEL
By this fair light which greeteth us before
Those other nations that beneath us far
In noisome cities pent draw painful breath
Swear we the oath of our confederacy
A band of brothers true we swear to be
Never to part in danger or in death

They repeat his words with three fingers raised

We swear we will be free as were our sires
And sooner die than live in slavery

All repeat as before

We swear to put our trust in God Most High
And not to quail before the might of man

All repeat as before and embrace each other

STAUFF
Now every man pursue his several way
Back to his friends his kindred and his home
Let the herd winter up his flock and gain
In secret friends for this great league of ours
What for a time must be endured endure
And let the reckoning of the tyrants grow
Till the great day arrive when they shall pay
The general and particular debt at once
Let every man control his own just rage
And nurse his vengeance for the public wrongs
For he whom selfish interests now engage
Defrauds the general weal of what to it belongs

As they are going off in profound silence in three different
directions the orchestra plays a solemn air The empty scene remains
open for some time showing the rays of the sun rising over the
Glaciers



ACT III


SCENE I

Court before Tells house Tell with an axe Hedwig engaged in her
domestic duties Walter and William in the background playing with a
little crossbow


 Walter sings
With his crossbow and his quiver
 The huntsman speeds his way
Over mountain dale and river
 At the dawning of the day
As the eagle on wild pinion
 Is the king in realms of air
So the hunter claims dominion
 Over crag and forest lair
Far as ever bow can carry
 Thro the trackless airy space
All he sees he makes his quarry
 Soaring bird and beast of chase

WILL runs forward
My string has snapped Oh father mend it do

TELL
Not I a trueborn archer helps himself

Boys retire

HEDW
The boys begin to use the bow betimes

TELL
Tis early practice only makes the master

HEDW
Ah Would to heaven they never learned the art

TELL
But they shall learn it wife in all its points
Whoeer would carve an independent way
Through life must learn to ward or plant a blow

HEDW
Alas alas and they will never rest
Contentedly at home

TELL
No more can I
I was not framed by nature for a shepherd
My restless spirit ever yearns for change
I only feel the flush and joy of life
If I can start fresh quarry every day

HEDW
Heedless the while of all your wifes alarms
As she sits watching through long hours at home
For my soul sinks with terror at the tales
The servants tell about the risks you run
Wheneer we part my trembling heart forebodes
That you will neer come back to me again
I see you on the frozen mountain steeps
Missing perchance your leap from crag to crag
I see the chamois with a wild rebound
Drag you down with him oer the precipice
I see the avalanche close oer your head
The treacherous ice give way and you sink down
Intombed alive within its hideous gulf
Ah in a hundred varying forms does death
Pursue the Alpine huntsman on his course
That way of life can surely neer be blessed
Where life and limb are perilld every hour

TELL
The man that bears a quick and steady eye
And trusts in God and his own lusty thews
Passes with scarce a scar through every danger
The mountain cannot awe the mountain child

Having finished his work he lays aside his tools

And now methinks the door will hold awhile
Axe in the house oft saves the carpenter

Takes his cap

HEDW
Whither away

TELL
To Altdorf to your father

HEDW
You have some dangerous enterprise in view
Confess

TELL
Why think you so

HEDW
Some schemes on foot
Against the governors There was a Diet
Held on the Rootlithat I knowand you
Are one of the confederacy Im sure

TELL
I was not there Yet will I not hold back
Wheneer my country calls me to her aid

HEDW
Wherever danger is will you be placed
On you as ever will the burden fall

TELL
Each man shall have the post that fits his powers

HEDW
You tookay mid the thickest of the storm
The man of Unterwald across the lake
Tis marvel you escaped Had you no thought
Of wife and children then

TELL
Dear wife I had
And therefore saved the father for his children

HEDW
To brave the lake in all its wrath Twas not
To put your trust in God Twas tempting Him

TELL
Little will he thats over cautious do

HEDW
Yes youve a kind and helping hand for all
But be in straits and who will lend you aid

TELL
God grant I neer may stand in need of it

Takes up his crossbow and arrows

HEDW
Why take your crossbow with you leave it here

TELL
I want my right hand when I want my bow

The boys return

WALT
Where father are you going

TELL
To granddad boy
To Altdorf Will you go

WALT
Ay that I will

HEDW
The Viceroys there just now Go not to Altdorf

TELL
He leaves today

HEDW
Then let him first be gone
Cross not his pathYou know he bears us grudge

TELL
His illwill cannot greatly injure me
I do whats right and care for no mans hate

HEDW
Tis those who do whats right whom most he hates

TELL
Because he cannot reach them Me I ween
His knightship will be glad to leave in peace

HEDW
AyAre you sure of that

TELL
Not long ago
As I was hunting through the wild ravines
Of Shechenthal untrod by mortal foot
There as I took my solitary way
Along a shelving ledge of rocks where twas
Impossible to step on either side
For high above rose like a giant wall
The precipices side and far below
The Shechen thunderd oer its rifted bed

The boys press towards him looking upon him with excited curiosity

There face to face I met the Viceroy He
Alone with meand I myself alone
Mere man to man and near us the abyss
And when his lordship had perused my face
And knew the man he had severely fined
On some most trivial ground not long before
And saw me with my sturdy bow in hand
Come striding towards him his cheek grew pale
His knees refused their office and I thought
He would have sunk against the mountain side
Then touchd with pity for him I advanced
Respectfully and said Tis I my lord
But neer a sound could he compel his lips
To frame in answer Only with his hand
He beckoned me in silence to proceed
So I passd on and sent his train to seek him

HEDW
He trembled then before you Woe the while
You saw his weakness that hell neer forgive

TELL
I shun him therefore and hell not seek me

HEDW
But stay away today Go hunt instead

TELL
What do you fear

HEDW
I am uneasy Stay

TELL
Why thus distress yourself without a cause

HEDW
Because there is no cause Tell Tell stay here

TELL
Dear wife I gave my promise I would go

HEDW
Must youthen go But leave the boys with me

WALT
No mother dear I go with father I

HEDW
How Walter Will you leave your mother then

WALT
Ill bring you pretty things from grandpapa

Exit with his father

WIL
Mother Ill stay with you

HEDW embracing him
Yes yes thou art
My own dear child Thourt all thats left to me

She goes to the gate of the court and looks anxiously after Tell and
her son for a considerable time


SCENE II

A retired part of the forestBrooks dashing in spray over the rocks

Enter Bertha in a hunting dress Immediately afterwards Rudenz


BERTH
He follows me Now then to speak my mind

RUD entering hastily
At length dear lady we have met alone
In this wild dell with rocks on every side
No jealous eye can watch our interview
Now let my heart throw off this weary silence

BERTH
But are you sure they will not follow us

RUD
See yonder goes the chase Now then or never
I must avail me of this precious chance
Must hear my doom decided by thy lips
Though it should part me from thy side forever
Oh do not arm that gentle face of thine
With looks so stern and harsh Whowho am I
That dare aspire so high as unto thee
Fame hath not stampd me yet nor may I take
My place amid the courtly throng of knights
That crownd with glorys lustre woo thy smiles
Nothing have I to offer but a heart
That overflows with truth and love for thee

BERTH sternly and with severity
And dare you speak to me of loveof truth
You that are faithless to your nearest ties
You that are Austrias slavebartered and sold
To heran alien and your countrys tyrant

RUD
How This reproach from thee Whom do I seek
On Austrias side my own beloved but thee

BERTH
Think you to find me in the traitors ranks
Now as I live Id rather give my hand
To Gesslers self all despot though he be
Than to the Switzer who forgets his birth
And stoops to be a tyrants servile tool

RUD
Oh Heaven what words are these

BERTH
Say What can lie
Nearer the good mans heart than friends and kindred
What dearer duty to a noble soul
Than to protect weak suffering innocence
And vindicate the rights of the oppressd
My very soul bleeds for your countrymen
I suffer with them for I needs must love them
They are so gentle yet so full of power
They draw my whole heart to them Every day
I look upon them with increased esteem
But you whom nature and your knightly vow
Have given them as their natural protector
Yet who desert them and abet their foes
In forging shackles for your native land
Youyou incense and wound me to the core
It tries me to the utmost not to hate you

RUD
Is not my countrys welfare all my wish
What seek I for her but to purchase peace
Neath Austrias potent sceptre

BERTH
Bondage rather
You would drive Freedom from the last stronghold
That yet remains for her upon the earth
The people know their own true intrests better
Their simple natures are not warpd by show
But round your head a tangling net is wound

RUD
Bertha you hate meyou despise me

BERTH
Nay And if I did twere better for my peace
But to see him despised and despicable
The man whom one might love

RUD
Oh Bertha You
Show me the pinnacle of heavenly bliss
Then in a moment hurl me to despair

BERTH
No no the noble is not all extinct
Within you It but slumbersI will rouse it
It must have cost you many a fiery struggle
To crush the virtues of your race within you
But Heaven be praised tis mightier than yourself
And you are noble in your own despite

RUD
You trust me then Oh Bertha with thy love
What might I not become

BERTH
Be only that
For which your own high nature destind you
Fill the position you were born to fill
Stand by your people and your native land
And battle for your sacred rights

RUD
Alas How can I win youhow can you be mine
If I take arms against the Emperor
Will not your potent kinsmen interpose
To dictate the disposal of your hand

BERTH
All my estates lie in the Forest Cantons
And I am free when Switzerland is free

RUD
Oh what a prospect Bertha hast thou shown me

BERTH
Hope not to win my hand by Austrias grace
Fain would they lay their grasp on my estates
To swell the vast domains which now they hold
The selfsame lust of conquest that would rob
You of your liberty endangers mine
Oh friend Im markd for sacrificeto be
The guerdon of some parasite perchance
Theyll drag me hence to the Imperial court
That hateful haunt of falsehood and intrigue
And marriage bonds I loathe await me there
Love love aloneyour love can rescue me

RUD
And thou couldst be content love to live here
In my own native land to be my own
Oh Bertha all the yearnings of my soul
For this great world and its tumultuous strife
What were they but a yearning after thee
In glorys path I sought for thee alone
And all my thirst of fame was only love
But if in this calm vale thou canst abide
With me and bid earths pomps and pride adieu
Then is the goal of my ambition won
And the rough tide of the tempestuous world
May dash and rave around these firmset hills
No wandering wishes more have I to send
Forth to the busy scene that stirs beyond
Then may these rocks that girdle us extend
Their giant walls impenetrably round
And this sequestered happy vale alone
Look up to heaven and be my paradise

BERTH
Now art thou all my fancy dreamd of thee
My trust has not been given to thee in vain

RUD
Away ye idle phantoms of my folly
In mine own home Ill find my happiness
Here where the gladsome boy to manhood grew
Where evry brook and tree and mountain peak
Teems with remembrances of happy hours
In mine own native land thou wilt be mine
Ah I have ever loved it well I feel
How poor without it were all earthly joys

BERTH
Where should we look for happiness on earth
If not in this dear land of innocence
Here where old truth hath its familiar home
Where fraud and guile are strangers envy neer
Shall dim the sparkling fountain of our bliss
And ever bright the hours shall oer us glide
There do I see thee in true manly worth
The foremost of the free and of thy peers
Revered with homage pure and unconstraind
Wielding a power that kings might envy thee

RUD
And thee I see thy sexs crowning gem
With thy sweet womans grace and wakeful love
Building a heaven for me within my home
And as the springtime scatters forth her flowers
Adorning with thy charms my path of life
And spreading joy and sunshine all around

BERTH
And this it was dear friend that caused my grief
To see thee blast this lifes supremest bliss
With thine own hand Ah what had been my fate
Had I been forced to follow some proud lord
Some ruthless despot to his gloomy keep
Here are no keeps here are no bastiond walls
To part me from a people I can bless

RUD
Yet how to free myself to loose the coils
Which I have madly twined around my head

BERTH
Tear them asunder with a mans resolve
Whateer ensue firm by thy people stand
It is thy post by birth

Hunting horns are heard in the distance

But hark The chase
Farewelltis needful we should partaway
Fight for thy land thou fightest for thy love
One foe fills all our souls with dread the blow
That makes one free emancipates us all

Exeunt severally


SCENE III

A meadow near Altdorf Trees in the foreground At the back of the
stage a cap upon a pole The prospect is bounded by the Bannberg
which is surmounted by a snowcapped mountain

Friesshardt and Leuthold on guard


FRIESS
We keep our watch in vain Zounds not a soul
Will pass and do obeisance to the cap
But yesterday the place swarmd like a fair
Now the old green looks like a desert quite
Since yonder scarecrow hung upon the pole

LEUTH
Only the vilest rabble show themselves
And wave their tattered caps in mockery at us
All honest citizens would sooner make
A weary circuit over half the town
Than bend their backs before our masters cap

FRIESS
They were obliged to pass this way at noon
As they were coming from the Council House
I counted then upon a famous catch
For no one thought of bowing to the cap
But Rosselmann the priest was even with me
Coming just then from some sick man he takes
His stand before the polelifts up the Host
The Sacrist too must tinkle with his bell
When down they droppd on kneemyself and all
In reverence to the Host but not the cap

LEUTH
Hark ye companion Ive a shrewd suspicion
Our posts no better than the pillory
It is a burning shame a trooper should
Stand sentinel before an empty cap
And every honest fellow must despise us
To do obeisance to a cap too Faith
I never heard an order so absurd

FRIESS
Why not ant please you to an empty cap
Youve duckd Im sure to many an empty sconce

Hildegard Mechthild and Elsbeth enter with their children and
station themselves around the pole

LEUTH
And you are a timeserving sneak that takes
Delight in bringing honest folks to harm
For my part he that likes may pass the cap
Ill shut my eyes and take no note of him

MECH
There hangs the Viceroy Your obeisance children

ELS
I would to God hed go and leave his cap
The country would be none the worse for it

FRIESS driving them away
Out of the way Confounded pack of gossips
Who sent for you Go send your husbands here
If they have courage to defy the order

Tell enters with his crossbow leading his son Walter by the hand
They pass the hat without noticing it and advance to the front of the
stage

WALT pointing to the Bannberg
Father ist true that on the mountain there
The trees if wounded with a hatchet bleed

TELL
Who says so boy

WALT
The master herdsman father
He tells us theres a charm upon the trees
And if a man shall injure them the hand
That struck the blow will grow from out the grave

TELL
There is a charm about themthats the truth
Dost see those glaciers yonderthose white horns
That seem to melt away into the sky

WALT
They are the peaks that thunder so at night
And send the avalanches down upon us

TELL
They are and Altdorf long ago had been
Submerged beneath these avalanches weight
Did not the forest there above the town
Stand like a bulwark to arrest their fall

WALT after musing a little
And are there countries with no mountains father

TELL
Yes if we travel downwards from our heights
And keep descending where the rivers go
We reach a wide and level country where
Our mountain torrents brawl and foam no more
And fair large rivers glide serenely on
All quarters of the heaven may there be scannd
Without impediment The corn grows there
In broad and lovely fields and all the land
Is like a garden fair to look upon

WALT
But father tell me wherefore haste we not
Away to this delightful land instead
Of toiling here and struggling as we do

TELL
The land is fair and bountiful as Heaven
But they who till it never may enjoy
The fruits of what they sow

WALT
Live they not free
As you do on the land their fathers left them

TELL
The fields are all the bishops or the kings

WALT
But they may freely hunt among the woods

TELL
The game is all the monarchsbird and beast

WALT
But they at least may surely fish the streams

TELL
Stream lake and sea all to the king belong

WALT
Who is this king of whom theyre so afraid

TELL
He is the man who fosters and protects them

WALT
Have they not courage to protect themselves

TELL
The neighbour there dare not his neighbour trust

WALT
I should want breathing room in such a land
Id rather dwell beneath the avalanches

TELL
Tis better child to have these glacier peaks
Behind ones back than evilminded men

They are about to pass on

WALT
See father see the cap on yonder pole

TELL
What is the cap to us Come lets begone

As he is going Friesshardt presenting his pike stops him

FRIESS
Stand I command you in the Emperors name

TELL seizing the pike
What would ye Wherefore do ye stop me thus

FRIESS
Youve broke the mandate and with us must go

LEUTH
You have not done obeisance to the cap

TELL
Friend let me go

FRIESS
Away away to prison

WALT
Father to prison Help

Calling to the side scene

This way you men
Good people help Theyre dragging him to prison

Rosselmann the priest and the Sacristan with three other men
enter

SACRIS

ROSSEL
Why do you seize this man

FRIESS
He is an enemy of the Kinga traitor

TELL seizing him with violence
A traitor I

ROSSEL

WALT descries Furst and runs up to him
Grandfather help they want to seize my father

FRIESS
Away to prison

FURST running in
Stay I offer bail
For Gods sake Tell what is the matter here

Melchthal and Stauffacher enter

LEUTH
He has contemnd the Viceroys sovereign power
Refusing flatly to acknowledge it

STAUFF
Has Tell done this

MELCH
Villain you know tis false

LEUTH
He has not made obeisance to the cap

FURST
And shall for this to prison Come my friend
Take my security and let him go

FRIESS
Keep your security for yourselfyoull need it
We only do our duty Hence with him

MELCH to the country people
This is too badshall we stand by and see
Him dragged away before our very eyes

SACRIS
We are the strongest Friends endure it not
Our countrymen will back us to a man

FRIESS
Who dares resist the governors commands

OTHER THREE PEASANTS running in
Well help you
Whats the matter Down with them

Hildegard Mechthild and Elsbeth return

TELL
Go go good people I can help myself
Think you had I a mind to use my strength
These pikes of theirs should daunt me

MELCH to Friesshardt
Only try
Try from our midst to force him if you dare

FURST and STAUFF
Peace peace friends

FRIESS loudly
Riot Insurrection ho

Hunting horns without

WOMEN
The Governor

FRIESS raising his voice
Rebellion Mutiny

STAUFF
Roar till you burst knave

ROSSEL and MELCH
Will you hold your tongue

FRIESS calling still louder
Help help I say the servants of the law

FURST
The Viceroy here Then we shall smart for this

Enter Gessler on horseback with a falcon on his wrist Rudolph der
Harras Bertha and Rudenz and a numerous train of armed attendants
who form a circle of lances round the whole stage

HAR
Room for the Viceroy

GESSL
Drive the clowns apart
Why throng the people thus Who calls for help

General silence

Who was it I will know

Friesshardt steps forward

And who art thou
And why hast thou this man in custody

Gives his falcon to an attendant

FRIESS
Dread sir I am a soldier of your guard
And stationd sentinel beside the cap
This man I apprehended in the act
Of passing it without obeisance due
So as you ordered I arrested him
Whereon to rescue him the people tried

GESSL after a pause
And do you Tell so lightly hold your King
And me who act as his viceregent here
That you refuse obeisance to the cap
I hung aloft to test your loyalty
I read in this a disaffected spirit

TELL
Pardon me good my lord The action sprung
From inadvertencenot from disrespect
Were I discreet I were not Wilhelm Tell
Forgive me nowIll not offend again

GESSL after a pause
I hear Tell youre a master with the bow
From every rival bear the palm away

WALT
Thats very truth sir At a hundred yards
Hell shoot an apple for you off the tree

GESSL
Is that boy thine Tell

TELL
Yes my gracious lord

GESSL
Hast any more of them

TELL
Two boys my lord

GESSL
And of the two which dost thou love the most

TELL
Sir both the boys are dear to me alike

GESSL
Then Tell since at a hundred yards thou canst
Bring down the apple from the tree thou shalt
Approve thy skill before me Take thy bow
Thou hast it there at handmake ready then
To shoot an apple from the striplings head
But take this counsellook well to thine aim
See that thou hitst the apple at the first
For shouldst thou miss thy head shall pay the forfeit

All give signs of horror

TELL
What monstrous thing my lord is this you ask
What from the head of mine own childNo no
It cannot be kind sir you meant not that
God in His grace forbid You could not ask
A father seriously to do that thing

GESSL
Thou art to shoot an apple from his head
I do desirecommand it so

TELL
What I
Level my crossbow at the darling head
Of mine own child Norather let me die

GESSL
Or thou must shoot or with thee dies the boy

TELL
Shall I become the murderer of my child
You have no children siryou do not know
The tender throbbings of a fathers heart

GESSL
How now Tell on a sudden so discreet
I had been told thou wert a visionary
A wanderer from the paths of common men
Thou lovst the marvellous So have I now
Culld out for thee a task of special daring
Another man might pause and hesitate
Thou dashest at it heart and soul at once

BERTH
Oh do not jest my lord with these poor souls
See how they tremble and how pale they look
So little used are they to hear thee jest

GESSL
Who tells thee that I jest

Grasping a branch above his head

Here is the apple
Room there I say And let him take his distance
Just eighty pacesas the custom is
Not an inch more or less It was his boast
That at a hundred he could hit his man
Now archer to your task and look you miss not

HAR
Heavens this grows seriousdown boy on your knees
And beg the governor to spare your life

FURST aside to Melchthal who can scarcely restrain his indignation
Command yourselfbe calm I beg of you

BERTHA to the Governor
Let this suffice you sir It is inhuman
To trifle with a fathers anguish thus
Although this wretched man had forfeited
Both life and limb for such a slight offence
Already has he sufferd tenfold death
Send him away uninjured to his home
Hell know thee well in future and this hour
He and his childrens children will remember

GESSL
Open a way therequick Why this delay
Thy life is forfeited I might dispatch thee
And see I graciously repose thy fate
Upon the skill of thine own practised hand
No cause has he to say his doom is harsh
Whos made the master of his destiny
Thou boastest thine unerring aim Tis well
Now is the fitting time to show thy skill
The mark is worthy and the prize is great
To hit the bulls eye in the targetthat
Can many another do as well as thou
But he methinks is master of his craft
Who can at all times on his skill rely
Nor lets his heart disturb or eye or hand

FURST
My lord we bow to your authority
But oh let justice yield to mercy here
Take half my property nay take it all
But spare a father this unnatural doom

WALT
Grandfather do not kneel to that bad man
Say where am I to stand I do not fear
My father strikes the bird upon the wing
And will not miss now when twould harm his boy

STAUFF
Does the childs innocence not touch your heart

ROSSEL
Bethink you sir there is a God in heaven
To whom you must account for all your deeds

GESSL pointing to the boy
Bind him to yonder lime tree

WALT
What Bind me
No I will not be bound I will be still
Still as a lambnor even draw my breath
But if you bind me I can not be still
Then I shall writhe and struggle with my bonds

HAR
But let your eyes at least be bandaged boy

WALT
And why my eyes No Do you think I fear
An arrow from my fathers hand Not I
Ill wait it firmly nor so much as wink
Quick father show them what thy bow can do
He doubts thy skillhe thinks to ruin us
Shoot then and hit though but to spite the tyrant

He goes to the lime tree and an apple is placed on his head

MELCH to the country people
What Is this outrage to be perpetrated
Before our very eyes Where is our oath

STAUFF
Resist we cannot Weapons we have none
And see the wood of lances round us See

MELCH
Oh would to heaven that we had struck at once
God pardon those who counselld the delay

GESSL to Tell
Now to your task Men bear not arms for naught
To carry deadly tools is dangerous
And on the archer oft his shaft recoils
This right these haughty peasant churls assume
Trenches upon their masters privileges
None should be armed but those who bear command
It pleases you to carry bow and bolt
Wellbe it so I will prescribe the mark

TELL bends the bow and fixes the arrow
A lane there Room

STAUFF
What Tell You wouldno no
You shakeyour hands unsteadyyour knees tremble

TELL letting the bow sink down
Theres something swims before mine eyes

WOMEN
Great Heaven

TELL
Release me from this shot Here is my heart

Tears open his breast

Summon your trooperslet them strike me down

GESSL
Tis not thy life I wantI want the shot
Thy talents universal Nothing daunts thee
The rudder thou canst handle like the bow
No storms affright thee when a lifes at stake
Now saviour help thyselfthou savest all

Tell stands fearfully agitated by contending emotions his hands
moving convulsively and his eyes turning alternately to the Governor
and Heaven Suddenly he takes a second arrow from his quiver and
sticks it in his belt The Governor notes all he does

WALT beneath the lime tree
Shoot father shoot fear not

TELL
It must be

Collects himself and levels the bow

RUD who all the while has been standing in a state of violent
excitement and has with difficulty restrained himself advances
My lord you will not urge this matter further
You will not It was surely but a test
Youve gained your object Rigour pushd too far
Is sure to miss its aim however good
As snaps the bow thats all too straitly bent

GESSL
Peace till your counsels askd for

RUD
I will speak
Ay and I dare I reverence my king
But acts like these must make his name abhorrd
He sanctions not this cruelty I dare
Avouch the fact And you outstep your powers
In handling thus my harmless countrymen

GESSL
Ha thou growst bold methinks

RUD
I have been dumb
To all the oppressions I was doomed to see
Ive closed mine eyes to shut them from my view
Bade my rebellious swelling heart be still
And pent its struggles down within my breast
But to be silent longer were to be
A traitor to my king and country both

BERTH casting herself between him and the Governor
Oh Heavens you but exasperate his rage

RUD
My people I forsookrenounced my kindred
Broke all the ties of nature that I might
Attach myself to you I madly thought
That I should best advance the general weal
By adding sinews to the Emperors power
The scales have fallen from mine eyesI see
The fearful precipice on which I stand
Youve led my youthful judgment far astray
Deceived my honest heart With best intent
I had wellnigh achievd my countrys ruin

GESSL
Audacious boy this language to thy lord

RUD
The Emperor is my lord not you Im free
As you by birth and I can cope with you
In every virtue that beseems a knight
And if you stood not here in that kings name
Which I respect een where tis most abused
Id throw my gauntlet down and you should give
An answer to my gage in knightly sort
Ay beckon to your troopers Here I stand
But not like these

Pointing to the people

unarmed I have a sword
And he that stirs one step

STAUFF exclaims
The apples down

While the attention of the crowd has been directed to the spot where
Bertha had cast herself between Rudenz and Gessler Tell has shot

ROSSEL
The boys alive

MANY VOICES
The apple has been struck

Walter Furst staggers and is about to fall Bertha supports him

GESSL astonished
How Has he shot The madman

BERTH
Worthy father
Pray you compose yourself The boys alive

WALT runs in with the apple
Here is the apple father Well I knew
You would not harm your boy

Tell stands with his body bent forwards as if still following the
arrow His bow drops from his hand When he sees the boy advancing he
hastens to meet him with open arms and embracing him passionately
sinks down with him quite exhausted All crowd round them deeply
affected

BERTH
Oh ye kind Heavens

FURST to father and son
My children my dear children

STAUFF
God be praised

LEUTH
Almighty powers That was a shot indeed
It will be talked of to the end of time

HAR
This feat of Tell the archer will be told
Long as these mountains stand upon their base

Hands the apple to Gessler

GESSL
By Heaven the apples cleft right through the core
It was a master shot I must allow

ROSSEL
The shot was good But woe to him who drove
The man to tempt his God by such a feat

STAUFF
Cheer up Tell rise Youve nobly freed yourself
And now may go in quiet to your home

ROSSEL
Come to the mother let us bear her son

They are about to lead him off

GESSL
A word Tell

TELL
Sir your pleasure

GESSL
Thou didst place
A second arrow in thy beltnay nay
I saw it well Thy purpose with it Speak

TELL confused
It is a custom with all archers sir

GESSL
No Tell I cannot let that answer pass
There was some other motive well I know
Frankly and cheerfully confess the truth
Whateer it be I promise thee thy life
Wherefore the second arrow

TELL
Well my lord
Since you have promised not to take my life
I will without reserve declare the truth

He draws the arrow from his belt and fixes his eyes sternly upon the
governor

If that my hand had struck my darling child
This second arrow I had aimed at you
And be assured I should not then have missd

GESSL
Well Tell I promised thou shouldst have thy life
I gave my knightly word and I will keep it
Yet as I know the malice of thy thoughts
Ill have thee carried hence and safely pennd
Where neither sun nor moon shall reach thine eyes
Thus from thy arrows I shall be secure
Seize on him guards and bind him

They bind him

STAUFF
How my lord
How can you treat in such a way a man
On whom Gods hand has plainly been reveald

GESSL
Well let us see if it will save him twice
Remove him to my ship Ill follow straight
At Kussnacht I will see him safely lodged

ROSSEL
You dare not dot Nor durst the Emperors self
So violate our dearest chartered rights

GESSL
Where are they Has the Empror confirmd them
He never has And only by obedience
May you that favour hope to win from him
You are all rebels gainst the Emprors power
And bear a desperate and rebellious spirit
I know you allI see you through and through
Him do I single from amongst you now
But in his guilt you all participate
If you are wise be silent and obey

Exit followed by Bertha Rudenz Harras and attendants Friesshardt
and Leuthold remain

FURST in violent anguish
Alls over now He is resolved to bring
Destruction on myself and all my house

STAUFF to Tell
Oh why did you provoke the tyrants rage

TELL
Let him be calm who feels the pangs I felt

STAUFF
Alas alas Our every hope is gone
With you we all are fettered and enchaind

COUNTRY PEOPLE surrounding Tell
Our last remaining comfort goes with you

LEUTH approaching him
Im sorry for you Tell but must obey

TELL
Farewell

WALT clinging to him in great agony
Oh father father father dear

TELL pointing to Heaven
Thy father is on highappeal to Him

STAUFF
Have you no message Tell to send your wife

TELL clasping the boy passionately to his breast
The boys uninjured God will succour me

Tears himself suddenly away and follows the soldiers of the guard

Eastern shore of the Lake of Lucerne rugged and singularly shaped
rocks close the prospect to the west The lake is agitated violent
roaring and rushing of wind with thunder and lightning at intervals

Kunz of Gersau Fisherman and Boy


KUNZ
I saw it with these eyes Believe me friend
It happend all precisely as Ive said

FISHER
How Tell a prisoner and to Kussnacht borne
The best man in the land the bravest arm
Had we for liberty to strike a blow

KUNZ
The Viceroy takes him up the lake in person
They were about to go on board as I
Started from Fluelen but the gathering storm
That drove me here to land so suddenly
May well have hindered them from setting out

FISHER
Our Tell in chains and in the Viceroys power
O trust me Gessler will entomb him where
He never more shall see the light of day
For Tell once free the tyrant well might dread
The just revenge of one so deeply wrongd

KUNZ
The old Landamman toovon Attinghaus
They say is lying at the point of death

FISHER
Then the last anchor of our hopes gives way
He was the only man that dared to raise
His voice in favour of the peoples rights

KUNZ
The storm grows worse and worse So fare ye well
Ill go and seek out quarters in the village
Theres not a chance of getting off today

Exit

FISHER
Tell draggd to prison and the Baron dead
Now tyranny exalt thy brazen front
Throw every shame aside Truths voice is dumb
The eye that watchd for us in darkness closed
The arm that should have struck thee down in chains

BOY
Tis hailing hardcome let us to the hut
This is no weather to be out in father

FISHER
Rage on ye winds Ye lightnings flash your fires
Burst ye swollen clouds Ye cataracts of Heaven
Descend and drown the country In the germ
Destroy the generations yet unborn
Ye savage elements be lords of all
Return ye bears ye ancient wolves return
To this wide howling waste The land is yours
Who would live here when liberty is gone

BOY
Hark How the wind whistles and the whirlpool roars
I never saw a storm so fierce as this

FISHER
To level at the head of his own child
Never had father such command before
And shall not Nature rising in wild wrath
Revolt against the deed I should not marvel
Though to the lake these rocks should bow their heads
Though yonder pinnacles yon towers of ice
That since creations dawn have known no thaw
Should from their lofty summits melt away
Though yonder mountains yon primeval cliffs
Should topple down and a new deluge whelm
Beneath its waves all living mens abodes

Bells heard

BOY
Hark they are ringing on the mountain yonder
They surely see some vessel in distress
And toll the bell that we may pray for it

Ascends a rock

FISHER
Woe to the bark that now pursues its course
Rockd in the cradle of these stormtost waves
Nor helm nor steersman here can aught avail
The storm is master Man is like a ball
Tossd twixt the winds and billows Far or near
No haven offers him its friendly shelter
Without one ledge to grasp the sheer smooth rocks
Look down inhospitably on his despair
And only tender him their flinty breasts

BOY calling from above
Father a ship from Fluelen bearing down

FISHER
Heaven pity the poor wretches When the storm
Is once entangled in this strait of ours
It rages like some savage beast of prey
Struggling against its cages iron bars
Howling it seeks an outletall in vain
For the rocks hedge it round on every side
Walling the narrow gorge as high as Heaven

He ascends a cliff

BOY
It is the Governor of Uris ship
By its red poop I know it and the flag

FISHER
Judgments of Heaven Yes it is he himself
It is the Governor Yonder he sails
And with him bears the burden of his crimes
The avengers arm has not been slow to strike
Now over him he knows a mightier lord
These waves yield no obedience to his voice
These rocks bow not their heads before his cap
Boy do not pray stay not the Judges arm

BOY
I pray not for the Governor I pray
For Tell whos with him there on board the ship

FISHER
Alas ye blind unreasoning elements
Must ye in punishing one guilty head
Destroy the vessel and the pilot too

BOY
See see theyve cleard the Buggisgrat but now
The blast rebounding from the Devils Minster
Has driven them back on the Great Axenberg
I cannot see them now

FISHER
The Hakmesser
Is there thats founderd many a gallant ship
If they should fail to double that with skill
Their bark will go to pieces on the rocks
That hide their jagged peaks below the lake
The best of pilots boy they have on board
If man could save them Tell is just the man
But he is manacled both hand and foot

 Rocks on the shore of the Lake of Lucerne

Enter William Tell with his crossbow He enters precipitately
looks wildly round and testifies the most violent agitation When he
reaches the centre of the stage he throws himself upon his knees and
stretches out his hands first towards the earth then towards
Heaven

BOY observing him
See father A man ons knees who can it be

FISHER
He clutches at the earth with both his hands
And looks as though he were beside himself

Boy advancing
What do I see Come father come and look

FISHER approaches
Who is it God in Heaven What Wilhelm Tell
How came you hither Speak Tell

BOY
Were you not
In yonder ship a prisoner and in chains

FISHER
Were they not carrying you to Kussnacht Tell

TELL rising
I am released

FISHER and BOY
Released oh miracle

BOY
Whence came you here

TELL
From yonder vessel

FISHER
What

BOY
Where is the Viceroy

TELL
Drifting on the waves

FISHER
Ist possible But you How are you here
How scaped you from your fetters and the storm

TELL
By Gods most gracious providence Attend

FISHER And BOY
Say on say on

TELL
You know what passed at Altdorf

FISHER
I dosay on

TELL
How I was seized and bound
And orderd by the governor to Kussnacht

FISHER
And how at Fluelen he embarked with you
All this we know Say how have you escaped

TELL
I lay on deck fast bound with cords disarmd
In utter hopelessness I did not think
Again to see the gladsome light of day
Nor the dear faces of my wife and boys
And eyed disconsolate the waste of waters

FISHER
Oh wretched man

TELL
Then we put forth the Viceroy
Rudolph der Harras and their suite My bow
And quiver lay astern beside the helm
And just as we had reached the corner near
The little Axen Heaven ordaind it so
That from the Gotthardts gorge a hurricane
Swept down upon us with such headlong force
That every oarsmans heart within him sank
And all on board lookd for a watery grave
Then heard I one of the attendant train
Turning to Gessler in this wise accost him
You see our danger and your own my lord
And that we hover on the verge of death
The boatmen there are powerless from fear
Nor are they confident what course to take
Now here is Tell a stout and fearless man
And knows to steer with more than common skill
How if we should avail ourselves of him
In this emergency The Viceroy then
Addressd me thus If thou wilt undertake
To bring us through this tempest safely Tell
I might consent to free thee from thy bonds
I answerd Yes my lord so help me God
Ill see what can be done On this they loosed
The cords that bound me and I took my place
Beside the helm and steered as best I could
Yet ever eyed my shooting gear askance
And kept a watchful eye upon the shore
To find some point where I might leap to land
And when I had descried a shelving crag
That jutted smooth atop into the lake

 A rock on the shore of the Lake of Lucerne

FISHER
I know it At the foot of the Great Axen
So steep it looks I never could have dreamt
That from a boat a man could leap to it

TELL
I bade the men to row with all their force
Until we came before the shelving ledge
For there I said the danger will be past
Stoutly they pulld and soon we neard the point
One prayer to God for His assisting grace
And straining every muscle I brought round
The vessels stern close to the rocky wall
Then snatching up my weapons with a bound
I swung myself upon the flattened shelf
And with my feet thrust off with all my might
The puny bark into the watery hell
There left it drift about as Heaven ordains
Thus am I here deliverd from the might
Of the dread storm and mans more dreadful still

FISHER
Tell Tell the Lord has manifestly wrought
A miracle in thy behalf I scarce
Can credit my own eyes But tell me now
Whither you purpose to betake yourself
For you will be in peril should perchance
The Viceroy scape this tempest with his life

TELL
I heard him say as I lay bound on board
At Brunnen he proposed to disembark
And crossing Schwytz convey me to his castle

FISHER
Means he to go by land

TELL
So he intends

FISHER
Oh then conceal yourself without delay
Not twice will Heaven release you from his grasp

TELL
Which is the nearest way to Arth and Kussnacht

FISHER
The public road leads by the way of Steinen
But theres a nearer road and more retired
That goes by Lowerz which my boy can show you

TELL gives him his hand
May Heaven reward your kindness Fare ye well

As he is going he comes back

Did not you also take the oath at Rootli
I heard your name methinks

FISHER
Yes I was there
And took the oath of confederacy

TELL
Then do me this one favour speed to Burglen
My wife is anxious at my absencetell her
That I am free and in secure concealment

FISHER
But whither shall I tell her you have fled

TELL
Youll find her father with her and some more
Who took the oath with you upon the Rootli
Bid them be resolute and strong of heart
For Tell is free and master of his arm
They shall hear further news of me ere long

FISHER
What have you then in view Come tell me frankly

TELL
When once tis done twill be in every mouth

Exit

FISHER
Show him the way boy Heaven be his support
Whateer he has resolved hell execute

Exit


SCENE II

Baronial mansion of Attinghausen The Baron upon a couch dying Walter
Furst Stauffacher Melchthal and Baumgarten attending round him
Walter Tell kneeling before the dying man


FURST
All now is over with him He is gone

STAUFF
He lies not like one dead The feather see
Moves on his lips His sleep is very calm
And on his features plays a placid smile

Baumgarten goes to the door and speaks with some one

FURST
Whos there

BAUM returning
Tells wife your daughter she insists
That she must speak with you and see her boy

Walter Tell rises

FURST
I who need comfortcan I comfort her
Does every sorrow centre on my head

HEDW forcing her way in
Where is my child unhand me I must see him

STAUFF
Be calm Reflect youre in the house of death

HEDW falling upon her boys neck
My Walter Oh he yet is mine

WALT
Dear mother

HEDW
And is it surely so Art thou unhurt

Gazing at him with anxious tenderness

And is it possible he aimd at thee
How could he do it Oh he has no heart
And he could wing an arrow at his child

FURST
His soul was rackd with anguish when he did it
No choice was left him but to shoot or die

HEDW
Oh if he had a fathers heart he would
Have sooner perishd by a thousand deaths

STAUFF
You should be grateful for Gods gracious care
That ordered things so well

HEDW
Can I forget
What might have been the issue God of Heaven
Were I to live for centuries I still
Should see my boy tied uphis fathers mark
And still the shaft would quiver in my heart

MELCH
You know not how the Viceroy taunted him

HEDW
Oh ruthless heart of man Offend his pride
And reason in his breast forsakes her seat
In his blind wrath hell stake upon a cast
A childs existence and a mothers heart

BAUM
Is then your husbands fate not hard enough
That you embitter it by such reproaches
Have you not feeling for his sufferings

HEDW turning to him and gazing full upon him
Hast thou tears only for thy friends distress
Say where were you when hemy noble Tell
Was bound in chains Where was your friendship then
The shameful wrong was done before your eyes
Patient you stood and let your friend be draggd
Ay from your very hands Did ever Tell
Act thus to you Did he stand whining by
When on your heels the Viceroys horsemen pressd
And full before you roared the stormtossd lake
Oh not with idle tears his pity showd
Into the boat he sprang forgot his home
His wife his children and delivered thee

FURST
It had been madness to attempt his rescue
Unarmd and few in numbers as we were

HEDW casting herself upon his bosom
Oh father and thou too hast lost my Tell
The countryall have lost him All lament
His loss and oh how he must pine for us
Heaven keep his soul from sinking to despair
No friends consoling voice can penetrate
His dreary dungeon walls Should he fall sick
Ah In the vapours of the murky vault
He must fall sick Even as the Alpine rose
Grows pale and withers in the swampy air
There is no life for him but in the sun
And in the breath of Heavens freshblowing airs
Imprisond Liberty to him is breath
He cannot live in the rank dungeon air

STAUFF
Pray you be calm And hand in hand well all
Combine to burst his prison doors

HEDW
He gone
What have you power to do While Tell was free
There still indeed was hopeweak innocence
Had still a friend and the oppressd a stay
Tell saved you all You cannot all combined
Release him from his cruel prison bonds

The Baron wakes

BAUM
Hush hush He starts

ATTING sitting up
Where is he

STAUFF
Who

ATTING
He leaves me
In my last moments he abandons me

STAUFF
He means his nephew Have they sent for him

FURST
He has been summoned Cheerly sir Take comfort
He has found his heart at last and is our own

ATTING
Say has he spoken for his native land

STAUFF
Ay like a hero

ATTING
Wherefore comes he not
That he may take my blessing ere I die
I feel my life fast ebbing to a close

STAUFF
Nay talk not thus dear sir This last short sleep
Has much refreshd you and your eye is bright

ATTING
Life is but pain and that has left me now
My sufferings like my hopes have passd away

Observing the boy

What boy is that

FURST
Bless him Oh good my lord
He is my grandson and is fatherless

Hedwig kneels with the boy before the dying man

ATTING
And fatherlessI leave you all ay all
Oh wretched fate that these old eyes should see
My countrys ruin as they close in death
Must I attain the utmost verge of life
To feel my hopes go with me to the grave

STAUFF to Furst
Shall he depart mid grief and gloom like this
Shall not his parting moments be illumed
By hopes inspiring beams My noble lord
Raise up your drooping spirit We are not
Forsaken quitepast all deliverance

ATTING
Who shall deliver you

FURST
Ourselves For know
The Cantons three are to each other pledged
To hunt the tyrants from the land The league
Has been concluded and a sacred oath
Confirms our union Ere another year
Begins its circling coursethe blow shall fall
In a free land your ashes shall repose

ATTING
The league concluded Is it really so

MELCH
On one day shall the Cantons rise together
All is prepared to strikeand to this hour
The secret closely kept though hundreds share it
The ground is hollow neath the tyrants feet
Their days of rule are numberd and ere long
No trace will of their hateful sway be left

ATTING
Ay but their castles how to master them

MELCH
On the same day they too are doomd to fall

ATTING
And are the nobles parties to this league

STAUFF
We trust to their assistance should we need it
As yet the peasantry alone have sworn

ATTING raising himself up in great astonishment
And have the peasantry dared such a deed
On their own charge without the nobles aid
Relied so much on their own proper strength
Nay then indeed they want our help no more
We may go down to death cheerd by the thought
That after us the majesty of man
Will live and be maintaind by other hands

He lays his hand upon the head of the child who is kneeling before
him

From this boys head whereon the apple lay
Your new and better liberty shall spring
The old is crumbling downthe times are changing
And from the ruins blooms a fairer life

STAUFF to Furst
See see what splendour streams around his eye
This is not Natures last expiring flame
It is the beam of renovated life

ATTING
From their old towers the nobles are descending
And swearing in the towns the civic oath
In Uechtland and Thurgau the works begun
The noble Berne lifts her commanding head
And Freyburg is a stronghold of the free
The stirring Zurich calls her guilds to arms
And now beholdthe ancient might of kings
Is shiverd gainst her everlasting walls

He speaks what follows with a prophetic tone his utterance rising
into enthusiasm

I see the princes and their haughty peers
Clad all in steel come striding on to crush
A harmless shepherd race with mailed hand
Desprate the conflict tis for life or death
And many a pass will tell to after years
Of glorious victories sealed in foemans blood
The peasant throws himself with naked breast
A willing victim on their serried spears
They yieldthe flower of chivalrys cut down
And Freedom waves her conquering banner high

 An allusion to the gallant selfdevotion of Arnold Struthan of
 Winkelried at the battle of Sempach 9th July 1386 who broke
 the Austrian phalanx by rushing on their lances grasping as many
 of them as he could reach and concentrating them upon his breast
 The confederates rushed forward through the gap thus opened by the
 sacrifice of their comrade broke and cut down their enemys
 ranks and soon became the masters of the field Dear and
 faithful confederates I will open you a passage Protect my wife
 and children were the words of Winkelried as he rushed to
 death

Grasps the hands of Walter Furst and Stauffacher

Hold fast together thenforever fast Let freedoms haunts be one
in heart and mind Set watches on your mountain tops that league May
answer league when comes the hour to strike Be onebe onebe one

He falls back upon the cushion His lifeless hands continue to grasp
those of Furst and Stauffacher who regard him for some moments in
silence and then retire overcome with sorrow Meanwhile the servants
have quietly pressed into the chamber testifying different degrees of
grief Some kneel down beside him and weep on his body while this
scene is passing the castle bell tolls

RUD entering hurriedly
Lives he Oh say can he still hear my voice

FURST averting his face
You are our seignior and protector now
Henceforth this castle bears another name

RUD gazing at the body with deep emotion
Oh God Is my repentance then too late
Could he not live some few brief moments more
To see the change that has come oer my heart
Oh I was deaf to his true counselling voice
While yet he walked on earth Now he is gone
Gone and foreverleaving me the debt
The heavy debt I owe himundischarged
Oh tell me did he part in anger with me

STAUFF
When dying he was told what you had done
And blessd the valour that inspired your words

RUD kneeling down beside the dead body
Yes sacred relics of a man beloved
Thou lifeless corpse Here on thy deathcold hand
Do I abjure all foreign ties for ever
And to my countrys cause devote myself
I am a Switzer and will act as one
With my whole heart and soul

Rises

Mourn for our friend
Our common parent yet be not dismayd
Tis not alone his lands that I inherit
His hearthis spirit have devolved on me
And my young arm shall execute the task
Which in his hoary age he could not pay
Give me your hands ye venerable sires
Thine Melchthal too Nay do not hesitate
Nor from me turn distrustfully away
Accept my plighted vowmy knightly oath

FURST
Give him your hands my friends A heart like his
That sees and owns its error claims our trust

MELCH
You ever held the peasantry in scorn
What surety have we that you mean us fair

RUD
Oh think not of the error of my youth

STAUFF to Melch
Be one They were our fathers latest words
See they be not forgotten

MELCH
Take my hand
A peasants handand with it noble sir
The gage and the assurance of a man
Without us sir what would the nobles be
Our order is more ancient too than yours

RUD
I honour itwill shield it with my sword

MELCH
The arm my lord that tames the stubborn earth
And makes its bosom blossom with increase
Can also shield its owners breast at need

RUD
Then you shall shield my breast and I will yours
Thus each be strengthend by the others strength
Yet wherefore talk ye while our native land
Is still to alien tyranny a prey
First let us sweep the foemen from the soil
Then reconcile our difference in peace

After a moments pause

How You are silent Not a word for me
And have I yet no title to your trust
Then must I force my way despite your will
Into the League you secretly have formd
Youve held a Diet on the RootliI
Know thisknow all that was transacted there
And though not trusted with your secret I
Have kept it closely like a sacred pledge
Trust meI never was my countrys foe
Nor would I ever have against you stood
Yet you did wrongto put your rising off
Time presses We must strike and swiftly too
Already Tell is lost through your delay

STAUFF
We swore that we should wait till Christmastide

RUD
I was not thereI did not take the oath
If you delay I will not

MELCH
What You would

RUD
I count me now among the countrys chiefs
And my first duty is to guard your rights

FURST
Your nearest and holiest duty is
Within the earth to lay these dear remains

RUD
When we have set the country free well place
Our fresh victorious wreaths upon his bier
Oh my dear friends tis not your cause alone
I with the tyrants have a cause to fight
That more concerns myself My Berthas gone
Has disappeard been carried off by stealth
Stolen from amongst us by their ruffian hands

STAUFF
So fell an outrage has the tyrant dared
Against a lady free and nobly born

RUD
Alas my friends I promised help to you
And I must first implore it for myself
She that I love is stolenis forced away
And who knows where shes by the tyrant hid
Or with what outrages his ruffian crew
May force her into nuptials she detests
Forsake me notOh help me to her rescue
She loves you Well oh well has she deserved
That all should rush to arms in her behalf

STAUFF
What course do you propose

RUD
Alas I know not
In the dark mystery that shrouds her fate
In the dread agony of this suspense
Where I can grasp at nought of certainty
One single ray of comfort beams upon me
From out the ruins of the tyrants power
Alone can she be rescued from the grave
Their strongholds must be levelld every one
Ere we can penetrate her dungeon walls

MELCH
Come lead us on We follow Why defer
Until tomorrow what today may do
Tells arm was free when we at Rootli swore
This foul enormity was yet undone
And change of circumstance brings change of vow
Who such a coward as to waver still

RUD to Walter Furst
Meanwhile to arms and wait in readiness
The fiery signal on the mountain tops
For swifter than a boat can scour the lake
Shall you have tidings of our victory
And when you see the welcome flames ascend
Then like the lightning swoop upon the foe
And lay the despots and their creatures low


SCENE III

The pass near Kussnacht sloping down from behind with rocks on
either side The travellers are visible upon the heights before they
appear on the stage Rocks all round the stage Upon one of the
foremost a projecting cliff overgrown with brushwood


TELL enters with his crossbow
Through this ravine he needs must come There is
No other way to Kussnacht Here Ill do it
The ground is everything I could desire
Yon elder bush will hide me from his view
And from that point my shaft is sure to hit
The straitness of the gorge forbids pursuit
Now Gessler balance thine account with Heaven
Thou must away from earththy sand is run
Quiet and harmless was the life I led
My bow was bent on forest game alone
No thoughts of murder rested on my soul
But thou hast scared me from my dream of peace
The milk of human kindness thou hast turnd
To rankling poison in my breast and made
Appalling deeds familiar to my soul
He who could make his own childs head his mark
Can speed his arrow to his foemans heart
My boys poor innocents my loyal wife
Must be protected tyrant from thy rage
When last I drew my bowwith trembling hand
And thou with fiendishly remorseless glee
Forced me to level at my own boys head
When I imploring pity writhed before thee
Then in the anguish of my soul I vowd
A fearful oath which met Gods ear alone
That when my bow next wingd an arrows flight
Its aim should be thy heart The vow I made
Amid the hellish torments of that moment
I hold a sacred debt and I will pay it
Thou art my lord my Emperors delegate
Yet would the Emperor not have stretchd his power
So far as thou hast done He sent thee here
To deal forth lawstern lawfor he is wroth
But not to wanton with unbridled will
In every cruelty with fiendlike joy
There lives a God to punish and avenge
Come forth thou bringer once of bitter pangs
My precious jewel nowmy chiefest treasure
A mark Ill set thee which the cry of grief
Could never penetratebut thou shalt pierce it
And thou my trusty bowstring that so oft
For sport has served me faithfully and well
Desert me not in this dread hour of need
Only be true this once my own good cord
That hast so often wingd the biting shaft
For shouldst thou fly successless from my hand
I have no second to send after thee

Travellers pass over the stage

Ill sit me down upon this bench of stone
Hewn for the wayworn travellers brief repose
For here there is no home Men hurry past
Each other with quick step and careless look
Nor stay to question of their grief Here goes
The merchant all anxietythe pilgrim
With scanty furnished scrip the pious monk
The scowling robber and the jovial player
The carrier with his heavyladen horse
That comes to us from the far haunts of men
For every road conducts to the worlds end
They all push onwardsevery man intent
On his own several businessmine is murder

Sits down

Time was my dearest children when with joy
You haild your fathers safe return to home
From his long mountain toils for when he came
He ever brought with him some little gift
A lovely Alpine flowera curious bird
Or elfbolt such as on the hills are found
But now he goes in quest of other game
Sits in this gorge with murder in his thoughts
And for his enemys lifeblood lies in wait
But still it is of you alone he thinks
Dear children Tis to guard your innocence
To shield you from the tyrants fell revenge
He bends his bow to do a deed of blood

Rises

WellI am watching for a noble prey
Does not the huntsman with unflinching heart
Roam for whole days when winter frosts are keen
Leap at the risk of death from rock to rock
And climb the jagged slippery steeps to which
His limbs are glued by his own streaming blood
And all to hunt a wretched chamois down
A far more precious prize is now my aim
The heart of that dire foe who seeks my life

Sprightly music heard in the distance which comes gradually nearer

From my first years of boyhood I have used
The bowbeen practised in the archers feats
The bulls eye many a time my shafts have hit
And many a goodly prize have I brought home
From competitions But this day Ill make
My mastershot and win whats best to win
In the whole circuit of our mountain range

A bridal party passes over the stage and goes up the pass Tell
gazes at it leaning on his bow He is joined by Stussi the Ranger

STUSSI
There goes the cloister bailiffs bridal train
Of Morlischachen A rich fellow he
And has some half score pastures on the Alps
He goes to fetch his bride from Imisee
At Kussnacht there will be high feast tonight
Come with usevry honest man is asked

TELL
A gloomy guest fits not a wedding feast

STUSSI
If youve a trouble dash it from your heart
Take what Heaven sends The times are heavy now
And we must snatch at pleasure as it flies
Here tis a bridal there a burial

TELL
And oft the one close on the other treads

STUSSI
So runs the world we live in Everywhere
Mischance befalls and misery enough
In Glarus there has been a landslip and
A whole side of the Glarnisch has fallen in

TELL
How Do the very hills begin to quake
There is stability for nought on earth

STUSSI
Of strange things too we hear from other parts
I spoke with one but now from Baden come
Who said a knight was on his way to court
And as he rode along a swarm of wasps
Surrounded him and settling on his horse
So fiercely stung the beast that it fell dead
And he proceeded to the court on foot

TELL
The weak are also furnishd with a sting

Armgart enters with several children and places herself at the
entrance of the pass

STUSSI
Tis thought to bode disaster to the land
Some horrid deeds against the course of nature

TELL
Why every day brings forth such fearful deeds
There needs no prodigy to herald them

STUSSI
Ay happy he who tills his field in peace
And sits at home untroubled with his kin

TELL
The very meekest cannot be at peace
If his ill neighbour will not let him rest

Tell looks frequently with restless expectation towards the top of
the pass

STUSSI
So fare you well Youre waiting some one here

TELL
I am

STUSSI
God speed you safely to your home
You are from Uri are you not His grace
The Governors expected thence today

TRAVELLER entering
Look not to see the Governor today
The streams are flooded by the heavy rains
And all the bridges have been swept away

Tell rises

ARM coming forward
Gessler not coming

STUSSI
Want you aught with him

ARM
Alas I do

STUSSI
Why then thus place yourself
Where you obstruct his passage down the pass

ARM
Here he cannot escape me He must hear me

FRIESS coming hastily down the pass and calls upon the stage
Make way make way My lord the Governor
Is close behind me riding down the pass

Exit TELL

ARM excitedly
The Viceroy comes

She goes towards the pass with her children Gessler and Rudolph der
Harras appear on horseback at the upper end of the pass

STUSSI to Friess
How got ye through the stream
When all the bridges have been carried down

FRIESS
Weve fought friend with the tempest on the lake
An Alpine torrents nothing after that

STUSSI
How Were you out then in that dreadful storm

FRIESS
We were Ill not forget it while I live

STUSSI
Stay speak

FRIESS
I cantmust to the castle haste
And tell them that the Governors at hand

Exit

STUSSI
If honest men now had been in the ship
It had gone down with every soul on board
Some folks are proof gainst fire and water both

Looking round

Where has the huntsman gone with whom I spoke

Exit

Enter Gessler and Rudolph der Harras on horseback

GESSL
Say what you will I am the Emperors liege
And how to please him my first thought must be
He did not send me here to fawn and cringe
And coax these boors into good humour No
Obedience he must have The struggles this
Is king or peasant to be sovereign here

ARM
Now is the moment Now for my petition

GESSL
Twas not in sport that I set up the cap
In Altdorfor to try the peoples hearts
All this I knew before I set it up
That they might learn to bend those stubborn necks
They carry far too proudlyand I placed
What well I knew their pride could never brook
Full in the road which they perforce must pass
That when their eye fell on it they might call
That lord to mind whom they too much forget

HAR
But surely sir the people have some rights

GESSL
This is not time to settle what they are
Great projects are at work and hatching now
The imperial house seeks to extend its power
Those vast designs of conquest which the sire
Has gloriously begun the son will end
This petty nation is a stumblingblock
One way or other it must be put down

They are about to pass on Armgart throws herself down before
Gessler

ARM
Mercy Lord Governor Oh pardon pardon

GESSL
Why do you cross me on the public road
Stand back I say

ARM
My husband lies in prison
My wretched orphans cry for bread Have pity
Pity my lord upon our sore distress

HAR
Who are you and your husband what is he

ARM
A poor wild hayman of the Rigiberg
Kind sir who on the brow of the abyss
Mows the unownerd grass from craggy shelves
To which the very cattle dare not climb

HAR to GESSL
By Heaven a sad and pitiable life
I pray you set the wretched fellow free
How great soever may be his offence
His horrid trade is punishment enough

To Armgart

You shall have justice To the castle bring
Your suit This is no place to deal with it

ARM
No no I will not stir from where I stand
Until your grace gives me my husband back
Six months already has he been shut up
And waits the sentence of a judge in vain

GESSL
How would you force me woman Hence Begone

ARM
Justice my lord Ay justice Thou art judge
Viceregent of the Emperorof Heaven
Then do thy dutyas thou hopest for justice
From Him who rules above show it to us

GESSL
Hence Drive this insolent rabble from my sight

ARM seizing his horses reins
No no by Heaven Ive nothing more to lose
Thou stirst not Viceroy from this spot until
Thou dost me fullest justice Knit thy brows
And roll thine eyesI fear not Our distress
Is so extreme so boundless that we care
No longer for thine anger

GESSL
Woman hence
Give way or else my horse shall ride you down

ARM
Well let itthere

Throws her children and herself upon the ground before him

Here on the ground I lie
I and my children Let the wretched orphans
Be trodden by thy horse into the dust
It will not be the worst that thou hast done

HAR
Are you mad woman

ARM continuing with vehemence
Many a day thou hast
Trampled the Emperors lands beneath thy feet
Oh I am but a woman Were I man
Id find some better thing to do than here
Lie grovelling in the dust

The music of the bridal party is again heard from the top of the
pass but more softly

GESSL
Where are my knaves
Drag her away lest I forget myself
And do some deed I may repent me of

HAR
My lord the servants cannot force their way
The pass is blockd up by a bridal train

GESSL
Too mild a ruler am I to this people
Their tongues are all too boldnor have they yet
Been tamed to due submission as they shall be
I must take order for the remedy
I will subdue this stubborn mood of theirs
This braggart spirit of freedom I will crush
I will proclaim a new law through the land
I will

An arrow pierces himhe puts his hand on his heart and is about to
sinkwith a feeble voice

Oh God have mercy on my soul

HAR
My lord my lord Oh God Whats this Whence came it

ARM starts up
Dead dead He reels he falls Tis in his heart

HAR springs from his horse
Horror of horrors Heavenly powers Sir Knight
Address yourself for mercy to your God
You are a dying man

GESSL
That shot was Tells

He slides from his horse into the arms of Rudolph der Harras who
lays him down upon the bench Tell appears above upon the rocks

TELL
Thou knowst the marksmanI and I alone
Now are our homesteads free and innocence
From thee is safe thoult be our curse no more

Tell disappears People rush in

STUSSI
What is the matter Tell me what has happend

ARM
The Viceroys shotpierced by a crossbow bolt

PEOPLE running in
Who has been shot

While the foremost of the marriage party are coming on the stage the
hindmost are still upon the heights The music continues

HAR
Hes bleeding fast to death
Away for helppursue the murderer
Unhappy man is this to be your end
You would not listen to my warning words

STUSSI
By Heaven his cheek is pale Lifes ebbing fast

MANY VOICES
Who did the deed

HAR
What Are the people mad
That they make music to a murder Silence

Music breaks off suddenly People continue to flock in

Speak if you can my lord Have you no charge
To trust me with

Gessler makes signs with his hand which he repeats with vehemence
when he finds they are not understood

Where shall I take you to
To Kussnacht What you say I cant make out
Oh do not grow impatient Leave all thought
Of earthly things and make your peace with Heaven

The whole marriage party gather round the dying man

STUSSI
See there how pale he grows Deaths gathering now
About his hearthis eyes grow dim and glazed

ARM holds up a child
Look children how a tyrant dies

HAR
Mad hag
Have you no touch of feeling that your eyes
Gloat on a sight so horrible as this
Help metake hold What will not one assist
To pull the torturing arrow from his breast

WOMEN
What touch the man whom Gods own hand has struck

HAR
All curses light on you

Draws his sword

STUSSI seizes his arm
Gently Sir Knight
Your power is at end Twere best forbear
Our countrys foe has fallen We will brook
No further violence We are free men

ALL
The countrys free

HAR
And is it come to this
Fear and obedience at an end so soon

To the soldiers of the guard who are thronging in

You see my friends the bloody piece of work
Has here been done Tis now too late for help
And to pursue the murderer were vain
Weve other things to think of On to Kussnacht
And let us save that fortress for the king
For in a moment such as this all ties
Of order fealty and faith are rent
And we can trust to no mans loyalty

As he is going out with the soldiers six Fratres Misericordiae
appear

ARM
Here comes the brotherhood of mercy Room

STUSSI
The victims slain and now the ravens stoop

BROTHERS OF MERCY form a semicircle round the body and sing in
solemn tones
Death hurries on with hasty stride
No respite man from him may gain
He cuts him down when lifes full tide
Is throbbing strong in every vein
Prepared or not the call to hear
He must before his Judge appear

While they are repeating the two last lines the curtain falls



ACT V


SCENE I

A common near Altdorf In the background to the right the keep of Uri
with the scaffold still standing as in the third scene of the first
Act To the left the view opens upon numerous mountains on all of
which signal fires are burning Day is breaking and distant bells are
heard ringing in several directions

Ruodi Kuoni Werni Master Mason and many other country people also
women and children


RUODI
See there The beacons on the mountain heights

MASON
Hark how the bells above the forest toll

RUODI
The enemys routed

MASON
And the forts are stormd

RUODI
And we of Uri do we still endure
Upon our native soil the tyrants keep
Are we the last to strike for liberty

MASON
Shall the yoke stand that was to curb our necks
Up Tear it to the ground

ALL
Down down with it

RUODI
Where is the Stier of Uri

URI
Here What would ye

RUODI
Up to your tower and wind us such a blast
As shall resound afar from peak to peak
Rousing the echoes of each glen and hill
To rally swiftly all the mountain men

Exit Stier of UriEnter Walter Furst

FURST
Stay stay my friends As yet we have not learnd
What has been done in Unterwald and Schwytz
Lets wait till we receive intelligence

RUODI
Wait wait for what The accursed tyrants dead
And on us freedoms glorious day has dawnd

MASON
How Are these flaming signals not enough
That blaze on every mountaintop around

RUODI
Come all fall tocome men and women all
Destroy the scaffold Burst the arches Down
Down with the walls let not a stone remain

MASON
Come comrades come We built it and we know
How best to hurl it down

ALL
Come Down with it

They fall upon the building on every side

FURST
The floodgates burst Theyre not to be restrained

Enter Melchthal and Baumgarten

MELCH
What Stands the fortress still when Sarnen lies
In ashes and the Rossbergs in our hands

FURST
You Melchthal here Dye bring us liberty
Are all the Cantons from our tyrants freed

MELCH
Weve swept them from the soil Rejoice my friend
Now at this very moment while we speak
Theres not one tyrant left in Switzerland

FURST
How did you get the forts into your power

MELCH
Rudenz it was who by a bold assault
With manly valour mastered Sarnens keep
The Rossberg I had stormd the night before
But hear what chanced Scarce had we driven the foe
Forth from the keep and given it to the flames
That now rose crackling upwards to the skies
When from the blaze rushd Diethelm Gesslers page
Exclaiming Lady Bertha will be burnt

FURST
Good heavens

The beams of the scaffold are heard falling

MELCH
Twas she herself Here had she been
By Gesslers orders secretly immured
Up sprang Rudenz in frenzy For even now
The beams and massive posts were crashing down
And through the stifling smoke the piteous shrieks
Of the unhappy lady

FURST
Is she saved

MELCH
Twas not a time to hesitate or pause
Had he been but our baron and no more
We should have been most chary of our lives
But he was our confederate and Bertha
Honourd the people So without a thought
We riskd the worst and rushd into the flames

FURST
But is she saved

MELCH
She is Rudenz and I
Bore her between us from the blazing pile
With crashing timbers toppling all around
And when she had revived the danger past
And raised her eyes to look upon the sun
The baron fell upon my breast and then
A silent vow between us two was sworn
A vow that welded in yon furnace heat
Will last through evry shock of time and fate

FURST
Where is the Landenberg

MELCH
Across the Brunig
Twas not my fault he bore his sight away
He who had robbd my father of his eyes
He fledI followedovertook him soon
And draggd him to my fathers feet The sword
Already quiverd oer the caitiffs head
When from the pity of the blind old man
He wrung the life which cravenlike he begged
He swore URPHEDE never to return
Hell keep his oath for he has felt our arm

 The Urphede was an oath of peculiar force When a man who was at
 feud with another invaded his lands and was worsted he often
 made terms with his enemy by swearing the Urphede by which he
 bound himself to depart and never to return with a hostile
 intention

FURST
Oh well for you you have not staind with blood
Our spotless victory

CHILDREN running across the stage with fragments of wood
Were free were free

FURST
Oh what a joyous scene These children will
Remember it when all their heads are grey

Girls bring in the cap upon a pole The whole stage is filled with
people

RUODI
Here is the cap to which we were to bow

BAUM
What shall we do with it Do you decide

FURST
Heavens Twas beneath this cap my grandson stood

SEVERAL VOICES
Destroy the emblem of the tyrants power
Let it be burnt

FURST
No Rather be preserved
Twas once the instrument of despotsnow
Twill of our freedom be a lasting sign

Peasants men women and children some standing others sitting
upon the beams of the shattered scaffold all picturesquely grouped
in a large semicircle

MELCH
Thus now my friends with light and merry hearts
We stand upon the wreck of tyranny
And gloriously the work has been fulfilled
Which we at Rootli pledged ourselves to do

FURST
No not fulfilled The work is but begun
Courage and concord firm we need them both
For be assured the king will make all speed
To avenge his Viceroys death and reinstate
By force of arms the tyrant weve expelled

MELCH
Why let him come with all his armaments
The foes expelled that pressd us from within
The foe without we are prepared to meet

RUODI
The passes to our Cantons are but few
These with our bodies we will block we will

BAUM
Knit are we by a league will neer be rent
And all his armies shall not make us quail

Enter Rosselmann and Stauffacher

ROSSEL speaking as he enters
These are the awful judgments of the Lord

PEAS
What is the matter

ROSSEL
In what times we live

FURST
Say on what ist Ha Werner is it you
What tidings

PEAS
Whats the matter

ROSSEL
Hear and wonder

STAUFF
We are released from one great cause of dread

ROSSEL
The Emperor is murdered

FURST
Gracious Heaven

Peasants rise up and throng round Stauffacher

ALL
Murderdthe Empror What The Empror Hear

MELCH
Impossible How came you by the news

STAUFF
Tis true Near Bruck by the assassins hand
King Albert fell A most trustworthy man
John Muller from Schaffhausen brought the news

FURST
Who dared commit so horrible a deed

STAUFF
The doer makes the deed more dreadful still
It was his nephew his own brothers son
Duke John of Austria who struck the blow

MELCH
What drove him to so dire a parricide

STAUFF
The Empror kept his patrimony back
Despite his urgent importunities
Twas said he meant to keep it for himself
And with a mitre to appease the duke
However this may be the duke gave ear
To the ill counsel of his friends in arms
And with the noble lords Von Eschenbach
Von Tegerfeld Von Wart and Palm resolved
Since his demands for justice were despised
With his own hands to take revenge at least

FURST
But saythe dreadful deed how was it done

STAUFF
The king was riding down from Stein to Baden
Upon his way to join the court at Rheinfeld
With him a train of highborn gentlemen
And the young Princes John and Leopold
And when theyd reachd the ferry of the Reuss
The assassins forced their way into the boat
To separate the Emperor from his suite
His highness landed and was riding on
Across a fresh ploughd fieldwhere once they say
A mighty city stood in Pagan times
With Hapsburgs ancient turrets full in sight
That was the cradle of his princely race
When Duke John plunged a dagger in his throat
Palm ran him thro the body with his lance
And Eschenbach to end him clove his skull
So down he sank all weltering in his blood
On his own soil by his own kinsmen slain
Those on the opposite bank beheld the deed
But parted by the stream could only raise
An unavailing cry of loud lament
A poor old woman sitting by the way
Raised him and on her breast he bled to death

MELCH
Thus has he dug his own untimely grave
Who sought insatiably to grasp it all

STAUFF
The country round is filld with dire alarm
The passes are blockaded everywhere
And sentinels on evry frontier set
Een ancient Zurich barricades her gates
That have stood open for these thirty years
Dreading the murdrers and th avengers more
For cruel Agnes comes the Hungarian Queen
By all her sexs tenderness untouchd
Armd with the thunders of the ban to wreak
Dire vengeance for her parents royal blood
On the whole race of those that murderd him
Their servants children childrens childrenyea
Upon the stones that built their castle walls
Deep has she sworn a vow to immolate
Whole generations on her fathers tomb
And bathe in blood as in the dew of May

MELCH
Ist known which way the murderers have fled

STAUFF
No sooner had they done the deed than they
Took flight each following a different route
And parted neer to see each other more
Duke John must still be wandring in the mountains

FURST
And thus their crime has borne no fruit for them
Revenge bears never fruit Itself it is
The dreadful food it feeds on its delight
Is murderits satiety despair

STAUFF
The assassins reap no profit by their crime
But we shall pluck with unpolluted hands
The teeming fruits of their most bloody deed
For we are ransomed from our heaviest fear
The direst foe of liberty has fallen
And tis reported that the crown will pass
From Hapsburgs house into another line
The Empire is determined to assert
Its old prerogative of choice I hear

FURST and several others
Is any named

STAUFF
The Count of Luxembourgs
Already chosen by the general voice

FURST
Tis well we stood so staunchly by the Empire
Now we may hope for justice and with cause

STAUFF
The Emperor will need some valiant friends
He will gainst Austrias vengeance be our shield

The peasantry embrace Enter Sacristan with Imperial messenger

SACRIS
Here are the worthy chiefs of Switzerland

ROSSEL and several others
Sacrist what news

SACRIS
A courier brings this letter

ALL to Walter Furst
Open and read it

FURST reading
To the worthy men Of Uri Schwytz and Unterwald the Queen
Elizabeth sends grace and all good wishes

MANY VOICES
What wants the queen with us Her reign is done

FURST reading
In the great grief and doleful widowhood
In which the bloody exit of her lord
Has plunged the queen still in her mind she bears
The ancient faith and love of Switzerland

MELCH
She neer did that in her prosperity

ROSSEL
Hush let us hear

FURST reading
And she is well assured
Her people will in due abhorrence hold
The perpetrators of this damned deed
On the three Cantons therefore she relies
That they in nowise lend the murderers aid
But rather that they loyally assist
To give them up to the avengers hand
Remembering the love and grace which they
Of old received from Rudolphs royal house

Symptoms of dissatisfaction among the peasantry

MANY VOICES
The love and grace

STAUFF
Grace from the father we indeed received
But what have we to boast of from the son
Did he confirm the charter of our freedom
As all preceding emperors had done
Did he judge righteous judgment or afford
Shelter or stay to innocence oppressd
Nay did he een give audience to the men
We sent to lay our grievances before him
Not one of all these things did the king do
And had we not ourselves achieved our rights
By our own stalwart hands the wrongs we bore
Had never touchd him Gratitude to him
Within these vales he sowed no seeds of that
He stood upon an eminencehe might
Have been a very father to his people
But all his aim and pleasure was to raise
Himself and his own house and now may those
Whom he has aggrandized lament for him

FURST
We will not triumph in his fall nor now
Recall to mind the wrongs that we endured
Far bet from us Yet that we should avenge
The sovereigns death who never did us good
And hunt down those who neer molested us
Becomes us not nor is our duty Love
Must be a tribute free and unconstraind
From all enforced duties death absolves
And unto him we owe no further debt

MELCH
And if the queen laments within her bower
Accusing Heaven in sorrows wild despair
Here see a people from its anguish freed
To that same Heavn send up its thankful praise
Who would reap tears must sow the seeds of love

Exit the Imperial courier

STAUFF to the people
But where is Tell Shall he our freedoms founder
Alone be absent from our festival
He did the mostendured the worst of all
Cometo his dwelling let us all repair
And bid the Saviour of our country hail

Exeunt omnes


SCENE II

Has shielded you and set my country free
Freely I raise it in the face of Heaven

Monk gives a sudden starthe looks at him

MONK stepping nearer
Are you the Tell who slew the Governor

TELL
Yes I am he I hide the fact from no man

MONK
And you are Tell Ah it is Gods own hand
That hath conducted me beneath your roof

TELL examining him closely
You are no monk Who are you

MONK

HEDW

Exit with the children

TELL to the Monk
You are the Duke Of AustriaI know it
You have slain The Emperor your uncle and liege lord

JOHN
He robbd me of my patrimony

TELL
How Slain himyour king your uncle And the earth
Still bears you And the sun still shines on you

JOHN
Tell hear me are you

TELL
Reeking with the blood
Of him that was your Emperor your kinsman
Dare you set foot within my spotless house
Dare to an honest man to show your face
And claim the rights of hospitality

JOHN
I hoped to find compassion at your hands
You took like me revenge upon your foe

TELL
Unhappy man Dare you confound the crime
Of bloodimbrued ambition with the act
Forced on a father in mere selfdefence
Had you to shield your childrens darling heads
To guard your firesides sanctuaryward off
The last the direst doom from all you loved
To Heaven I raise my unpolluted hands
To curse your act and you I have avenged
That holy nature which you have profaned
I have no part with you You murdered I
Have shielded all that was most dear to me

JOHN
You cast me off to comfortless despair

TELL
I shrink with horror while I talk with you
Hence on the dread career you have begun
Cease to pollute the home of innocence

John turns to depart

JOHN
I cannot and I will not live this life

TELL
And yet my soul bleeds for you Gracious Heaven
So young of such a noble line the grandson
Of Rudolph once my lord and Emperor
An outcastmurdererstanding at my door
The poor mans doora suppliant in despair

Covers his face

JOHN
If you have power to weep oh let my fate
Move your compassionit is horrible
I amsay rather wasa prince I might
Have been most happy had I only curbd
The impatience of my passionate desires
But envy gnawd my heartI saw the youth
Of mine own cousin Leopold endowd
With honour and enrichd with broad domains
The while myself of equal age with him
In abject slavish nonage was kept back

TELL
Unhappy man your uncle knew you well
When from you land and subjects he withheld
You by your mad and desperate act have set
A fearful seal upon his wise resolve
Where are the bloody partners of your crime

JOHN
Whereer the avenging furies may have borne them
I have not seen them since the luckless deed

TELL
Know you the Empires ban is outthat you
Are interdicted to your friends and given
An outlawd victim to your enemies

JOHN
Therefore I shun all public thoroughfares
And venture not to knock at any door
I turn my footsteps to the wilds and through
The mountains roam a terror to myself
From mine own self I shrink with horror back
If in a brook I see my illstarrd form
If you have pity or a human heart

Falls down before him

TELL
Stand up stand up I say

JOHN
Not till you give
Your hand in promise of assistance to me

TELL
Can I assist you Can a sinful man
Yet get ye uphow black soeer your crime
You are a man I too am one From Tell
Shall no one part uncomforted I will
Do all that lies within my power

JOHN springs up and grasps him ardently by the hand
Oh Tell
You save me from the terrors of despair

TELL
Let go my hand You must away You can not
Remain here undiscoverd and discoverd
You cannot count on succour Which way then
Would you be going Where do you hope to find
A place of rest

JOHN
Alas I know not where

TELL
Hear then what Heaven unto my heart suggests
You must to Italyto Saint Peters City
There cast yourself at the Popes feetconfess
Your guilt to him and ease your laden soul

JOHN
Will he not to the avengers yield me up

TELL
Whateer he does accept it as from God

JOHN
But how am I to reach that unknown land
I have no knowledge of the way and dare not
Attach myself to other travellers

TELL
I will describe the road so mark me well
You must ascend keeping along the Reuss
Which from the mountains dashes wildly down

JOHN in alarm
What See the Reuss The witness of my deed

TELL The road you take lies through the rivers gorge
And many a cross proclaims where travellers
Have been by avalanches done to death

JOHN
I have no fear for natures terrors so
I can appease the torments of my soul

TELL
At every cross kneel down and expiate
Your crime with burning penitential tears
And if you scape the perils of the pass
And are not whelmd beneath the drifted snows
That from the frozen peaks come sweeping down
Youll reach the bridge thats drenchd with drizzling spray
Then if it give not way beneath your guilt
When you have left it safely in your rear
Before you frowns the gloomy Gate of Rocks
Where never sun did shine Proceed through this
And you will reach a bright and gladsome vale
Yet must you hurry on with hasty steps
You must not linger in the haunts of peace

JOHN
O Rudolph Rudolph royal grandsire Thus
Thy grandson first sets foot within thy realms

TELL
Ascending still you gain the Gotthardts heights
Where are the tarns the everlasting tarns
That from the streams of Heaven itself are fed
There to the German soil you bid farewell
And thence with swift descent another stream
Leads you to Italy your promised land

Ranz des Vaches sounded on Alphorns is heard without

But I hear voices Hence

HEDW hurrying in
Where art thou Tell
My father comes and in exulting bands
All the confederates approach

DUKE JOHN covering himself
Woes me I dare not tarry mong these happy men

TELL
Go dearest wife and give this man to eat
Spare not your bounty for his road is long
And one where shelter will be hard to find
Quickthey approach

HEDW
Who is he

TELL
Do not ask
And when he quits you turn your eyes away
So that you do not see which way he goes

Duke John advances hastily towards Tell but he beckons him aside and
exit When both have left the stage the scene changes


SCENE III

The whole valley before Tells house the heights which enclose it
occupied by peasants grouped into tableaux Some are seen crossing a
lofty bridge which crosses the Shechen

Walter Furst with the two boys Werner and Stauffacher come forward
Others throng after them When Tell appears all receive him with loud
cheers


ALL
Long live brave Tell our shield our saviour

While those in front are crowding round Tell and embracing him
Rudenz and Bertha appear The former salutes the peasantry the latter
embraces Hedwig The music from the mountains continues to play When
it has stopped Bertha steps into the centre of the crowd

BERTH
Peasants Confederates Into your league
Receive me who was happily the first
That found deliverance in the land of freedom
To your brave hands I now entrust my rights
Will you protect me as your citizen

PEAS
Ay that we will with life and goods

BERTH
Tis well And now to him

Turning to Rudenz

I frankly give my hand
A free Swiss maiden to a free Swiss man

RUD
And from this moment all my serfs are free

Music and the curtain falls
