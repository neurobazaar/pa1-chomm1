The Legend of LIle Derniere

I

Travelling south from New Orleans to the Islands you pass through a
strange land into a strange sea by various winding waterways You can
journey to the Gulf by lugger if you please but the trip may be made
much more rapidly and agreeably on some one of those light narrow
steamers built especially for bayoutravel which usually receive
passengers at a point not far from the foot of old SaintLouis Street
hard by the sugarlanding where there is ever a pushing and flocking
of steam craftall striving for place to rest their white breasts
against the levee side by sidelike great weary swans But the
miniature steamboat on which you engage passage to the Gulf never
lingers long in the Mississippi she crosses the river slips into
some canalmouth labors along the artificial channel awhile and then
leaves it with a scream of joy to puff her free way down many a league
of heavily shadowed bayou Perhaps thereafter she may bear you through
the immense silence of drenched ricefields where the yellowgreen
level is broken at long intervals by the black silhouette of some
irrigating machinebut whichever of the five different routes be
pursued you will find yourself more than once floating through sombre
mazes of swampforestpast assemblages of cypresses all hoary with
the parasitic tillandsia and grotesque as gatherings of fetichgods
Ever from river or from lakelet the steamer glides again into canal or
bayoufrom bayou or canal once more into lake or bay and sometimes
the swampforest visibly thins away from these shores into wastes of
reedy morass where even of breathless nights the quaggy soil trembles
to a sound like thunder of breakers on a coast the stormroar of
billions of reptile voices chanting in cadencerhythmically surging
in stupendous crescendo and diminuendoa monstrous and appalling
chorus of frogs 

Panting screaming scraping her bottom over the sandbarsall day
the little steamer strives to reach the grand blaze of blue open water
below the marshlands and perhaps she may be fortunate enough to enter
the Gulf about the time of sunset For the sake of passengers she
travels by day only but there are other vessels which make the journey
also by nightthreading the bayoulabyrinths winter and summer
sometimes steering by the North Starsometimes feeling the way with
poles in the white season of fogssometimes again steering by that
Star of Evening which in our sky glows like another moon and drops
over the silent lakes as she passes a quivering trail of silver fire

Shadows lengthen and at last the woods dwindle away behind you into
thin bluish linesland and water alike take more luminous
colorbayous open into broad passeslakes link themselves with
seabaysand the oceanwind bursts upon youkeen cool and full of
light For the first time the vessel begins to swingrocking to the
great living pulse of the tides And gazing from the deck around you
with no forest walls to break the view it will seem to you that the
low land must have once been rent asunder by the sea and strewn about
the Gulf in fantastic tatters

Sometimes above a waste of windblown prairiecane you see an oasis
emerginga ridge or hillock heavily umbraged with the rounded foliage
of evergreen oaksa cheniere And from the shining flood also
kindred green knolls arisepretty islets each with its beachgirdle
of dazzling sand and shells yellowwhiteand all radiant with
semitropical foliage myrtle and palmetto orange and magnolia Under
their emerald shadows curious little villages of palmetto huts are
drowsing where dwell a swarthy population of OrientalsMalay
fishermen who speak the SpanishCreole of the Philippines as well as
their own Tagal and perpetuate in Louisiana the Catholic traditions of
the Indies There are girls in those unfamiliar villages worthy to
inspire any statuarybeautiful with the beauty of ruddy
bronzegracile as the palmettoes that sway above them Further
seaward you may also pass a Chinese settlement some queer camp of
wooden dwellings clustering around a vast platform that stands above
the water upon a thousand pilesover the miniature wharf you can
scarcely fail to observe a white signboard painted with crimson
ideographs The great platform is used for drying fish in the sun and
the fantastic characters of the sign literally translated mean
HeapShrimpPlenty  And finally all the land melts down into
desolations of seamarsh whose stillness is seldom broken except by
the melancholy cry of longlegged birds and in wild seasons by that
sound which shakes all shores when the weird Musician of the Sea
touches the bass keys of his mighty organ


II

Beyond the seamarshes a curious archipelago lies If you travel by
steamer to the seaislands today you are tolerably certain to enter
the Gulf by Grande Passskirting Grande Terre the most familiar
island of all not so much because of its proximity as because of its
great crumbling fort and its graceful pharos the stationary
WhiteLight of Barataria Otherwise the place is bleakly
uninteresting a wilderness of windswept grasses and sinewy weeds
waving away from a thin beach ever speckled with drift and decaying
thingswormriddled timbers dead porpoises

Eastward the russet level is broken by the columnar silhouette of the
light house and again beyond it by some puny scrub timber above
which rises the angular ruddy mass of the old brick fort whose ditches
swarm with crabs and whose sluiceways are half choked by obsolete
cannonshot now thickly covered with incrustation of oyster shells
Around all the gray circling of a sharkhaunted sea

Sometimes of autumn evenings there when the hollow of heaven flames
like the interior of a chalice and waves and clouds are flying in one
wild rout of broken goldyou may see the tawny grasses all covered
with something like huskswheatcolored huskslarge flat and
disposed evenly along the leeside of each swaying stalk so as to
present only their edges to the wind But if you approach those pale
husks all break open to display strange splendors of scarlet and
sealbrown with arabesque mottlings in white and black they change
into wondrous living blossoms which detach themselves before your eyes
and rise in air and flutter away by thousands to settle down farther
off and turn into wheatcolored husks once more  a whirling
flowerdrift of sleepy butterflies

Southwest across the pass gleams beautiful Grande Isle primitively a
wilderness of palmetto latanierthen drained diked and cultivated
by Spanish sugarplanters and now familiar chiefly as a
bathingresort Since the war the ocean reclaimed its ownthe
canefields have degenerated into sandy plains over which tramways
wind to the smooth beachthe plantationresidences have been
converted into rustic hotels and the negroquarters remodelled into
villages of cozy cottages for the reception of guests But with its
imposing groves of oak its golden wealth of orangetrees its odorous
lanes of oleander

its broad grazingmeadows yellowstarred with wild camomile Grande
Isle remains the prettiest island of the Gulf and its loveliness is
exceptional For the bleakness of Grand Terre is reiterated by most of
the other islandsCaillou Cassetete Calumet Wine Island the twin
Timbaliers Gull Island and the many islets haunted by the gray
pelicanall of which are little more than sandbars covered with wiry
grasses prairiecane and scrubtimber Last Island LIle
Dernierewell worthy a long visit in other years in spite of its
remoteness is now a ghastly desolation twentyfive miles long Lying
nearly forty miles west of Grande Isle it was nevertheless far more
populated a generation ago it was not only the most celebrated island
of the group but also the most fashionable wateringplace of the
aristocratic Southtoday it is visited by fishermen only at long
intervals Its admirable beach in many respects resembled that of
Grande Isle today the accommodations also were much similar although
finer a charming village of cottages facing the Gulf near the western
end The hotel itself was a massive twostory construction of timber
containing many apartments together with a large diningroom and
dancinghall In rear of the hotel was a bayou where passengers
landedVillage Bayou it is still called by seamenbut the deep
channel which now cuts the island in two a little eastwardly did not
exist while the village remained The sea tore it out in one
nightthe same night when trees fields dwellings all vanished into
the Gulf leaving no vestige of former human habitation except a few of
those strong brick props and foundations upon which the frame houses
and cisterns had been raised One living creature was found there
after the cataclysma cow But how that solitary cow survived the
fury of a stormflood that actually rent the island in twain has ever
remained a mystery 


III

On the Gulf side of these islands you may observe that the treeswhen
there are any treesall bend away from the sea and even of bright
hot days when the wind sleeps there is something grotesquely pathetic
in their look of agonized terror A group of oaks at Grande Isle I
remember as especially suggestive five stooping silhouettes in line
against the horizon like fleeing women with streaming garments and
windblown hairbowing grievously and thrusting out arms desperately
northward as to save themselves from falling And they are being
pursued indeedfor the sea is devouring the land Many and many a
mile of ground has yielded to the tireless charging of Oceans cavalry
far out you can see through a good glass the porpoises at play where
of old the sugarcane shook out its million bannerets and sharkfins
now seam deep water above a site where pigeons used to coo Men build
dikes but the besieging tides bring up their batteringramswhole
forests of drifthuge trunks of wateroak and weighty cypress
Forever the yellow Mississippi strives to build forever the sea
struggles to destroyand amid their eternal strife the islands and
the promontories change shape more slowly but not less fantastically
than the clouds of heaven

And worthy of study are those wan battlegrounds where the woods made
their last brave stand against the irresistible invasionusually at
some long point of seamarsh widely fringed with billowing sand Just
where the waves curl beyond such a point you may discern a multitude of
blackened snaggy shapes protruding above the watersome high enough
to resemble ruined chimneys others bearing a startling likeness to
enormous skeletonfeet and skeletonhandswith crustaceous white
growths clinging to them here and there like remnants of integument
These are bodies and limbs of drowned oaksso long drowned that the
shellscurf is inchthick upon parts of them Farther in upon the
beach immense trunks lie overthrown Some look like vast broken
columns some suggest colossal torsos imbedded and seem to reach out
mutilated stumps in despair from their deepening gravesand beside
these are others which have kept their feet with astounding obstinacy
although the barbarian tides have been charging them for twenty years
and gradually torn away the soil above and beneath their roots The
sand aroundsoft beneath and thinly crusted upon the surfaceis
everywhere pierced with holes made by a beautifully mottled and
semidiaphanous crab with hairy legs big staring eyes and milkwhite
clawswhile in the green sedges beyond there is a perpetual rustling
as of some strong wind beating among reeds a marvellous creeping of
fiddlers which the inexperienced visitor might at first mistake for
so many peculiar beetles as they run about sideways each with his
huge single claw folded upon his body like a wingcase Year by year
that rustling strip of green land grows narrower the sand spreads and
sinks shuddering and wrinkling like a living brown skin and the last
standing corpses of the oaks ever clinging with naked dead feet to
the sliding beach lean more and more out of the perpendicular As the
sands subside the stumps appear to creep their intertwisted masses of
snakish roots seem to crawl to writhelike the reaching arms of
cephalopods

 Grande Terre is going the sea mines her fort and will before
many years carry the ramparts by storm Grande Isle is goingslowly
but surely the Gulf has eaten three miles into her meadowed land
Last Island has gone How it went I first heard from the lips of a
veteran pilot while we sat one evening together on the trunk of a
drifted cypress which some high tide had pressed deeply into the Grande
Isle beach The day had been tropically warm we had sought the shore
for a breath of living air Sunset came and with it the ponderous
heat lifteda sudden breeze blewlightnings flickered in the
darkening horizonwind and water began to strive togetherand soon
all the low coast boomed Then my companion began his story perhaps
the coming of the storm inspired him to speak And as I listened to
him listening also to the clamoring of the coast there flashed back
to me recollection of a singular Breton fancy that the Voice of the
Sea is never one voice but a tumult of many voicesvoices of drowned
menthe muttering of multitudinous deadthe moaning of innumerable
ghosts all rising to rage against the living at the great Witch call
of storms


IV

The charm of a single summer day on these island shores is something
impossible to express never to be forgotten Rarely in the paler
zones do earth and heaven take such luminosity those will best
understand me who have seen the splendor of a West Indian sky And yet
there is a tenderness of tint a caress of color in these Gulfdays
which is not of the Antillesa spirituality as of eternal tropical
spring It must have been to even such a sky that Xenophanes lifted up
his eyes of old when he vowed the Infinite Blue was Godit was indeed
under such a sky that De Soto named the vastest and grandest of
Southern havens Espiritu Santothe Bay of the Holy Ghost There is a
something unutterable in this bright Gulfair that compels
awesomething vital something holy something pantheistic and
reverentially the mind asks itself if what the eye beholds is not the
Pneuma indeed the Infinite Breath the Divine Ghost the great Blue
Soul of the Unknown All all is blue in the calmsave the low land
under your feet which you almost forget since it seems only as a tiny
green flake afloat in the liquid eternity of day Then slowly
caressingly irresistibly the witchery of the Infinite grows upon you
out of Time and Space you begin to dream with open eyesto drift into
delicious oblivion of factsto forget the past the present the
substantialto comprehend nothing but the existence of that infinite
Blue Ghost as something into which you would wish to melt utterly away
forever

And this daymagic of azure endures sometimes for months together
Cloudlessly the dawn reddens up through a violet east

there is no speck upon the blossoming of its Mystical Roseunless it
be the silhouette of some passing gull whirling his sicklewings
against the crimsoning Ever as the sun floats higher the flood
shifts its color Sometimes smooth and gray yet flickering with the
morning gold it is the vision of Johnthe apocalyptic Sea of Glass
mixed with fireagain with the growing breeze it takes that
incredible purple tint familiar mostly to painters of West Indian
sceneryonce more under the blaze of noon it changes to a waste of
broken emerald With evening the horizon assumes tints of
inexpressible sweetnesspearllights opaline colors of milk and
fire and in the west are topazglowings and wondrous flushings as of
nacre Then if the sea sleeps it dreams of all thesefaintly
weirdlyshadowing them even to the verge of heaven

Beautiful too are those white phantasmagoria which at the approach
of equinoctial days mark the coming of the winds Over the rim of the
sea a bright cloud gently pushes up its head It rises and others
rise with it to right and leftslowly at first then more swiftly
All are brilliantly white and flocculent like loose new cotton
Gradually they mount in enormous line high above the Gulf rolling and
wreathing into an arch that expands and advancesbending from horizon
to horizon

A clear cold breath accompanies its coming Reaching the zenith it
seems there to hang poised awhilea ghostly bridge arching the
empyreanupreaching its measureless span from either underside of the
world Then the colossal phantom begins to turn as on a pivot of
airalways preserving its curvilinear symmetry but moving its unseen
ends beyond and below the skycircle And at last it floats away
unbroken beyond the blue sweep of the world with a wind following
after Day after day almost at the same hour the white arc rises
wheels and passes

 Never a glimpse of rock on these low shoresonly long sloping
beaches and bars of smooth tawny sand Sand and sea teem with
vitalityover all the dunes there is a constant susurration a
blattering and swarming of crustaceathrough all the sea there is a
ceaseless play of silver lightningflashing of myriad fish
Sometimes the shallows are thickened with minute transparent
crablike organismsall colorless as gelatine There are days also
when countless medusae drift inbeautiful veined creatures that throb
like hearts with perpetual systole and diastole of their diaphanous
envelops some of translucent azure or rose seem in the flood the
shadows or ghosts of huge campanulate flowersothers have the
semblance of strange living vegetablesgreat milky tubers just
beginning to sprout But woe to the human skin grazed by those shadowy
sproutings and spectral stamensthe touch of glowing iron is not more
painful Within an hour or two after their appearance all these
tremulous jellies vanish mysteriously as they came

Perhaps if a bold swimmer you may venture out alone a long wayonce
Not twiceeven in company As the water deepens beneath you and you
feel those ascending wavecurrents of coldness arising which bespeak
profundity you will also begin to feel innumerable touches as of
groping fingerstouches of the bodies of fish innumerable fish
fleeing towards shore The farther you advance the more thickly you
will feel them come and above you and around you to right and left
others will leap and fall so swiftly as to daze the sight like
intercrossing fountainjets of fluid silver The gulls fly lower about
you circling with sinister squeaking criesperhaps for an instant
your feet touch in the deep something heavy swift lithe that rushes
past with a swirling shock Then the fear of the Abyss the vast and
voiceless Nightmare of the Sea will come upon you the silent panic of
all those opaline millions that flee glimmering by will enter into you
also

From what do they flee thus perpetually Is it from the giant sawfish
or the ravening sharkfrom the herds of the porpoises or from the
grandeecaillethat splendid monster whom no net may holdall
helmed and armored in argent platemailor from the hideous devilfish
of the Gulfgigantic flatbodied black with immense sidefins ever
outspread like the pinions of a batthe terror of luggermen the
uprooter of anchors From all these perhaps and from other monsters
likewisegoblin shapes evolved by Nature as destroyers as
equilibrists as counterchecks to that prodigious fecundity which
unhindered would thicken the deep into one measureless and waveless
ferment of being But when there are many bathers these perils are
forgottennumbers give courageone can abandon ones self without
fear of the invisible to the long quivering electrical caresses of
the sea 


V

Thirty years ago Last Island lay steeped in the enormous light of even
such magical days July was dyingfor weeks no fleck of cloud had
broken the heavens blue dream of eternity winds held their breath
slow waveless caressed the bland brown beach with a sound as of kisses
and whispers To one who found himself alone beyond the limits of the
village and beyond the hearing of its voicesthe vast silence the
vast light seemed full of weirdness And these hushes these
transparencies do not always inspire a causeless apprehension they
are omens sometimesomens of coming tempest
Natureincomprehensible Sphinxbefore her mightiest bursts of rage
ever puts forth her divinest witchery makes more manifest her awful
beauty 

But in that forgotten summer the witchery lasted many long daysdays
born in roselight buried in gold It was the height of the season
The long myrtleshadowed village was thronged with its summer
populationthe big hotel could hardly accommodate all its
gueststhe bathinghouses were too few for the crowds who flocked to
the water morning and evening There were diversions for allhunting
and fishing parties yachting excursions rides music games
promenades Carriage wheels whirled flickering along the beach
seaming its smoothness noiselessly as if muffled Love wrote its
dreams upon the sand

 Then one great noon when the blue abyss of day seemed to yawn over
the world more deeply than ever before a sudden change touched the
quicksilver smoothness of the watersthe swaying shadow of a vast
motion First the whole seacircle appeared to rise up bodily at the
sky the horizoncurve lifted to a straight line the line darkened and
approacheda monstrous wrinkle an immeasurable fold of green water
moving swift as a cloudshadow pursued by sunlight But it had looked
formidable only by startling contrast with the previous placidity of
the open it was scarcely two feet highit curled slowly as it
neared the beach and combed itself out in sheets of woolly foam with a
low rich roll of whispered thunder Swift in pursuit another
followeda thirda feebler fourth then the sea only swayed a little
and stilled again Minutes passed and the immeasurable heaving
recommencedone two three four  seven long swells this
timeand the Gulf smoothed itself once more Irregularly the
phenomenon continued to repeat itself each time with heavier billowing
and briefer intervals of quietuntil at last the whole sea grew
restless and shifted color and flickered greenthe swells became
shorter and changed form Then from horizon to shore ran one
uninterrupted heavingone vast green swarming of snaky shapes rolling
in to hiss and flatten upon the sand Yet no single cirrusspeck
revealed itself through all the violet heights there was no
windyou might have fancied the sea had been upheaved from beneath 

And indeed the fancy of a seismic origin for a windless surge would not
appear in these latitudes to be utterly without foundation On the
fairest days a southeast breeze may bear you an odor singular enough to
startle you from sleepa strong sharp smell as of fishoil and
gazing at the sea you might be still more startled at the sudden
apparition of great oleaginous patches spreading over the water
sheeting over the swells That is if you had never heard of the
mysterious submarine oilwells the volcanic fountains unexplored
that well up with the eternal pulsing of the GulfStream 

But the pleasureseekers of Last Island knew there must have been a
great blow somewhere that day Still the sea swelled and a splendid
surf made the evening bath delightful Then just at sundown a
beautiful cloudbridge grew up and arched the sky with a single span of
cottony pink vapor that changed and deepened color with the dying of
the iridescent day And the cloudbridge approached stretched
strained and swung round at last to make way for the coming of the
galeeven as the light bridges that traverse the dreamy Teche swing
open when luggermen sound through their conchshells the long
bellowing signal of approach

Then the wind began to blow with the passing of July It blew from
the northeast clear cool It blew in enormous sighs dying away at
regular intervals as if pausing to draw breath All night it blew and
in each pause could be heard the answering moan of the rising surfas
if the rhythm of the sea moulded itself after the rhythm of the
airas if the waving of the water responded precisely to the waving
of the winda billow for every puff a surge for every sigh

The August morning broke in a bright skythe breeze still came cool
and clear from the northeast The waves were running now at a sharp
angle to the shore they began to carry fleeces an innumerable flock
of vague green shapes winddriven to be despoiled of their ghostly
wool Far as the eye could follow the line of the beach all the slope
was white with the great shearing of them Clouds came flew as in a
panic against the face of the sun and passed All that day and
through the night and into the morning again the breeze continued from
the north east blowing like an equinoctial gale 

Then day by day the vast breath freshened steadily and the waters
heightened A week later seabathing had become perilous
colossal breakers were herding in like moving leviathanbacks twice
the height of a man Still the gale grew and the billowing waxed
mightier and faster and faster overhead flew the tatters of torn
cloud The gray morning of the 9th wanly lighted a surf that appalled
the best swimmers the sea was one wild agony of foam the gale was
rending off the heads of the waves and veiling the horizon with a fog
of salt spray Shadowless and gray the day remained there were mad
bursts of lashing rain Evening brought with it a sinister apparition
looming through a cloudrent in the westa scarlet sun in a green sky
His sanguine disk enormously magnified seemed barred like the body of
a belted planet A moment and the crimson spectre vanished and the
moonless night came

Then the Wind grew weird It ceased being a breath it became a Voice
moaning across the worldhootinguttering nightmare
soundsWhoowhoowhooand with each stupendous owlcry the
mooing of the waters seemed to deepen more and more abysmally through
all the hours of darkness From the northwest the breakers of the bay
began to roll high over the sandy slope into the salinesthe village
bayou broadened to a bellowing flood  So the tumult swelled and the
turmoil heightened until morninga morning of gray gloom and
whistling rain Rain of bursting clouds and rain of windblown brine
from the great spuming agony of the sea

The steamer Star was due from St Marys that fearful morning Could
she come No one really believed itno one And nevertheless men
struggled to the roaring beach to look for her because hope is
stronger than reason 

Even today in these Creole islands the advent of the steamer is the
great event of the week There are no telegraph lines no telephones
the mailpacket is the only trustworthy medium of communication with
the outer world bringing friends news letters The magic of steam
has placed New Orleans nearer to New York than to the Timbaliers
nearer to Washington than to Wine Island nearer to Chicago than to
Barataria Bay And even during the deepest sleep of waves and winds
there will come betimes to sojourners in this unfamiliar archipelago a
feeling of lonesomeness that is a fear a feeling of isolation from the
world of mentotally unlike that sense of solitude which haunts one
in the silence of mountainheights or amid the eternal tumult of lofty
granitic coasts a sense of helpless insecurity

The land seems but an undulation of the seabed its highest ridges do
not rise more than the height of a man above the salines on either
sidethe salines themselves lie almost level with the level of the
floodtidesthe tides are variable treacherous mysterious But
when all around and above these everchanging shores the twin
vastnesses of heaven and sea begin to utter the tremendous revelation
of themselves as infinite forces in contention then indeed this sense
of separation from humanity appalls  Perhaps it was such a feeling
which forced men on the tenth day of August eighteen hundred and
fiftysix to hope against hope for the coming of the Star and to
strain their eyes towards faroff Terrebonne It was a wind you could
lie down on said my friend the pilot

 Great God shrieked a voice above the shouting of the
stormshe is coming  It was true Down the Atchafalaya and
thence through strange mazes of bayou lakelet and pass by a rear
route familiar only to the best of pilots the frail rivercraft had
toiled into Caillou Bay running close to the main shoreand now she
was heading right for the island with the wind aft over the monstrous
sea On she came swaying rocking plungingwith a great whiteness
wrapping her about like a cloud and moving with her movinga
tempestwhirl of sprayghostwhite and like a ghost she came for her
smokestacks exhaled no visible smokethe wind devoured it The
excitement on shore became wildmen shouted themselves hoarse women
laughed and cried Every telescope and operaglass was directed upon
the coming apparition all wondered how the pilot kept his feet all
marvelled at the madness of the captain

But Captain Abraham Smith was not mad A veteran American sailor he
had learned to know the great Gulf as scholars know deep books by
heart he knew the birthplace of its tempests the mystery of its
tides the omens of its hurricanes While lying at Brashear City he
felt the storm had not yet reached its highest vaguely foresaw a
mighty peril and resolved to wait no longer for a lull Boys he
said weve got to take her out in spite of Hell And they took her
out Through all the peril his men stayed by him and obeyed him By
midmorning the wind had deepened to a roarlowering sometimes to a
rumble sometimes bursting upon the ears like a measureless and
deafening crash Then the captain knew the Star was running a race
with Death Shell win it he mutteredshell stand it 
Perhaps theyll have need of me tonight

She won With a sonorous steamchant of triumph the brave little
vessel rode at last into the bayou and anchored hard by her accustomed
restingplace in full view of the hotel though not near enough to
shore to lower her gangplank But she had sung her swansong
Gathering in from the northeast the waters of the bay were already
marbling over the salines and half across the island and still the
wind increased its paroxysmal power

Cottages began to rock Some slid away from the solid props upon which
they rested A chimney fumbled Shutters were wrenched off verandas
demolished Light roofs lifted dropped again and flapped into ruin
Trees bent their heads to the earth And still the storm grew louder
and blacker with every passing hour

The Star rose with the rising of the waters dragging her anchor

Two more anchors were put out and still she draggeddragged in with
the floodtwisting shuddering careening in her agony Evening fell
the sand began to move with the wind stinging faces like a continuous
fire of fine shot and frenzied blasts came to buffet the steamer
forward sideward Then one of her hogchains parted with a clang like
the boom of a big bell Then another  Then the captain bade his
men to cut away all her upper works clean to the deck Overboard into
the seething went her stacks her pilothouse her cabinsand whirled
away And the naked hull of the Star still dragging her three
anchors labored on through the darkness nearer and nearer to the
immense silhouette of the hotel whose hundred windows were now all
aflame The vast timber building seemed to defy the storm The wind
roaring round its broad verandashissing through every crevice with
the sound and force of steamappeared to waste its rage And in the
halflull between two terrible gusts there came to the captains ears a
sound that seemed strange in that night of multitudinous terrors  a
sound of music


VI

 Almost every evening throughout the season there had been dancing
in the great hallthere was dancing that night also The population
of the hotel had been augmented by the advent of families from other
parts of the island who found their summer cottages insecure places of
shelter there were nearly four hundred guests assembled Perhaps it
was for this reason that the entertainment had been prepared upon a
grander plan than usual that it assumed the form of a fashionable
ball And all those pleasure seekersrepresenting the wealth and
beauty of the Creole parisheswhether from Ascension or Assumption
St Marys or St Landrys Iberville or Terrebonne whether
inhabitants of the multicolored and manybalconied Creole quarter of
the quaint metropolis or dwellers in the dreamy paradises of the
Techemingled joyously knowing each other feeling in some sort
akinwhether affiliated by blood connaturalized by caste or simply
interassociated by traditional sympathies of class sentiment and class
interest Perhaps in the more than ordinary merriment of that evening
something of nervous exaltation might have been discernedsomething
like a feverish resolve to oppose apprehension with gayety to combat
uneasiness by diversion But the hours passed in mirthfulness the
first general feeling of depression began to weigh less and less upon
the guests they had found reason to confide in the solidity of the
massive building there were no positive terrors no outspoken fears
and the new conviction of all had found expression in the words of the
host himselfIl ny a rien de mieux a faire que de samuser Of
what avail to lament the prospective devastation of canefieldsto
discuss the possible ruin of crops Better to seek solace in
choregraphic harmonies in the rhythm of gracious motion and of perfect
melody than hearken to the discords of the wild orchestra of
stormswiser to admire the grace of Parisian toilets the eddy of
trailing robes with its fairyfoam of lace the ivorine loveliness of
glossy shoulders and jewelled throats the glimmering of
satinslippered feetthan to watch the raging of the flood without
or the flying of the wrack 

So the music and the mirth went on they made joy for
themselvesthose elegant gueststhey jested and sipped rich
winesthey pledged and hoped and loved and promised with never a
thought of the morrow on the night of the tenth of August eighteen
hundred and fiftysix Observant parents were there planning for the
future bliss of their nearest and dearestmothers and fathers of
handsome lads lithe and elegant as young pines and fresh from the
polish of foreign university trainingmothers and fathers of splendid
girls whose simplest attitudes were witcheries Young cheeks flushed
young hearts fluttered with an emotion more puissant than the
excitement of the danceyoung eyes betrayed the happy secret
discreeter lips would have preserved Slaveservants circled through
the aristocratic press bearing dainties and wines praying permission
to pass in terms at once humble and officiousalways in the excellent
French which welltrained houseservants were taught to use on such
occasions

 Night wore on still the shining floor palpitated to the feet of
the dancers still the pianoforte pealed and still the violins
sangand the sound of their singing shrilled through the darkness in
gasps of the gale to the ears of Captain Smith as he strove to keep
his footing on the spraydrenched deck of the Star

Christ he muttereda dance If that wind whips round south
therell be another dance  But I guess the Star will stay 

Half an hour might have passed still the lights flamed calmly and the
violins trilled and the perfumed whirl went on  And suddenly the
wind veered

Again the Star reeled and shuddered and turned and began to drag all
her anchors But she now dragged away from the great building and its
lightsaway from the voluptuous thunder of the grand piano even at
that moment outpouring the great joy of Webers melody orchestrated by
Berlioz lInvitation a la Valsewith its marvellous musical swing

Waltzing cried the captain God help themGod help us all now
 The Wind waltzes tonight with the Sea for his partner 

O the stupendous ValseTourbillon O the mighty Dancer
Onetwothree From northeast to east from east to southeast from
southeast to south then from the south he came whirling the Sea in
his arms 

 Some one shrieked in the midst of the revelssome girl who found
her pretty slippers wet What could it be Thin streams of water were
spreading over the level plankingcurling about the feet of the
dancers  What could it be All the land had begun to quake even
as but a moment before the polished floor was trembling to the
pressure of circling stepsall the building shook now every beam
uttered its groan What could it be 

There was a clamor a panic a rush to the windy night Infinite
darkness above and beyond but the lanternbeams danced far out over an
unbroken circle of heaving and swirling black water Stealthily
swiftly the measureless seaflood was rising

Messieursmesdames ce nest rien Nothing serious ladies I
assure you  Mais nous en avons vu bien souvent les inondations
comme celleci ca passe vite The water will go down in a few hours
ladiesit never rises higher than this il ny a pas le moindre
danger je vous dis Allons il ny aMy God what is that 

For a moment there was a ghastly hush of voices And through that hush
there burst upon the ears of all a fearful and unfamiliar sound as of
a colossal cannonade rolling up from the south with volleying
lightnings Vastly and swiftly nearer and nearer it camea
ponderous and unbroken thunderroll terrible as the long muttering of
an earthquake

The nearest mainlandacross mad Caillou Bay to the seamarsheslay
twelve miles north west by the Gulf the nearest solid ground was
twenty miles distant There were boats yesbut the stoutest swimmer
might never reach them now

Then rose a frightful crythe hoarse hideous indescribable cry of
hopeless fearthe despairing animalcry man utters when suddenly
brought face to face with Nothingness without preparation without
consolation without possibility of respite  Sauve qui peut Some
wrenched down the doors some clung to the heavy banquettables to the
sofas to the billiardtablesduring one terrible instantagainst
fruitless heroisms against futile generositiesraged all the frenzy
of selfishness all the brutalities of panic And thenthen came
thundering through the blackness the giant swells boom on boom 
One crashthe huge frame building rocks like a cradle seesaws
crackles What are human shrieks nowthe tornado is shrieking
Anotherchandeliers splinter lights are dashed out a sweeping
cataract hurls in the immense hall risesoscillatestwirls as
upon a pivotcrepitatescrumbles into ruin Crash againthe
swirling wreck dissolves into the wallowing of another monster billow
and a hundred cottages overturn spin in sudden eddies quiver
disjoint and melt into the seething

 So the hurricane passedtearing off the heads of the prodigious
waves to hurl them a hundred feet in airheaping up the ocean
against the landupturning the woods Bays and passes were swollen
to abysses rivers regorged the seamarshes were changed to raging
wastes of water Before New Orleans the flood of the milebroad
Mississippi rose six feet above highest watermark One hundred and
ten miles away Donaldsonville trembled at the towering tide of the
Lafourche Lakes strove to burst their boundaries Faroff river
steamers tugged wildly at their cablesshivering like tethered
creatures that hear by night the approaching howl of destroyers
Smokestacks were hurled overboard pilothouses torn away cabins
blown to fragments

And over roaring Kaimbuck Passover the agony of Caillou Baythe
billowing tide rushed unresisted from the Gulftearing and swallowing
the land in its courseploughing out deepsea channels where sleek
herds had been grazing but a few hours beforerending islands in
twainand ever bearing with it through the night enormous vortex of
wreck and vast wan drift of corpses 

But the Star remained And Captain Abraham Smith with a long good
rope about his waist dashed again and again into that awful surging to
snatch victims from deathclutching at passing hands heads
garments in the cataractsweep of the seassaving aiding cheering
though blinded by spray and battered by drifting wreck until his
strength failed in the unequal struggle at last and his men drew him
aboard senseless with some beautiful halfdrowned girl safe in his
arms But wellnigh twoscore souls had been rescued by him and the
Star stayed on through it all

Long years after the weedgrown ribs of her graceful skeleton could
still be seen curving up from the sanddunes of Last Island in
valiant witness of how well she stayed


VII

Day breaks through the flying wrack over the infinite heaving of the
sea over the low land made vast with desolation It is a spectral
dawn a wan light like the light of a dying sun

The wind has waned and veered the flood sinks slowly back to its
abyssesabandoning its plunderscattering its piteous waifs over bar
and dune over shoal and marsh among the silences of the mangoswamps
over the long low reaches of sandgrasses and drowned weeds for more
than a hundred miles From the shellreefs of PointeauFer to the
shallows of Pelto Bay the dead lie mingled with the highheaped
driftfrom their cypress groves the vultures rise to dispute a share
of the feast with the shrieking frigatebirds and squeaking gulls And
as the tremendous tide withdraws its plunging waters all the pirates
of air follow the great whitegleaming retreat a storm of billowing
wings and screaming throats

And swift in the wake of gull and frigatebird the Wreckers come the
Spoilers of the deadsavage skimmers of the seahurricaneriders

beyond the comprehension of the oldest licensed pilot 

There is plunder for allbirds and men There are drowned sheep in
multitude heaped carcasses of kine There are casks of claret and
kegs of brandy and legions of bottles bobbing in the surf There are
billiardtables overturned upon the sandthere are sofas pianos

There are chests of cedar and toilettables of rosewood and trunks of

the great Nautilus went down There is money in notes and in coinin

 Suddenly a long mighty silver trilling fills the ears of all
there is a wild hurrying and scurrying swiftly one after another the
overburdened luggers spread wings and flutter away

Thrice the great cry rings rippling through the gray air and over the
green sea and over the farflooded shellreefs where the huge white

It is the steamcall of the reliefboat hastening to rescue the

The tremendous tragedy is over



Out of the Seas Strength

I

There are regions of Louisiana coast whose aspect seems not of the
present but of the immemorial pastof that epoch when low flat
reaches of primordial continent first rose into form above a Silurian
Sea To indulge this geologic dream any fervid and breezeless day
there it is only necessary to ignore the evolutional protests of a few
blue asters or a few composite flowers of the coryopsis sort which
contrive to display their rare flashes of color through the general
waving of catheads bloodweeds wild cane and marsh grasses For
at a hasty glance the general appearance of this marsh verdure is
vague enough as it ranges away towards the sand to convey the idea of
amphibious vegetationa primitive flora as yet undecided whether to
retain marine habits and forms or to assume terrestrial onesand the
occasional inspection of surprising shapes might strengthen this fancy
Queer flatlying and manybranching things which resemble seaweeds in
juiciness and color and consistency crackle under your feet from time
to time the moist and weighty air seems heated rather from below than
from aboveless by the sun than by the radiation of a cooling world
and the mists of morning or evening appear to simulate the vapory
exhalation of volcanic forceslatent but only dozing and
uncomfortably close to the surface And indeed geologists have
actually averred that those rare elevations of the soilwhich with
their heavy coronets of evergreen foliage not only look like islands
but are so called in the French nomenclature of the coasthave been
prominences created by ancient mud volcanoes

The family of a Spanish fisherman Feliu Viosca once occupied and gave
its name to such an islet quite close to the Gulfshorethe loftiest
bit of land along fourteen miles of just such marshy coast as I have
spoken of Landward it dominated a desolation that wearied the eye to
look at a wilderness of reedy sloughs patched at intervals with
ranges of bitterweed tufts of elbowbushes and broad reaches of
sawgrass stretching away to a bluishgreen line of woods that closed
the horizon and imperfectly drained in the driest season by a slimy
little bayou that continually vomited foul water into the sea The
point had been much discussed by geologists it proved a godsend to
United States surveyors weary of attempting to take observations among
quagmires moccasins and arborescent weeds from fifteen to twenty feet
high Savage fishermen at some unrecorded time had heaped upon the
eminence a hill of clamshellsrefuse of a million feasts earth
again had been formed over these perhaps by the blind agency of worms
working through centuries unnumbered and the new soil had given birth
to a luxuriant vegetation Millennial oaks interknotted their roots
below its surface and vouchsafed protection to many a frailer growth
of shrub or treewild orange waterwillow palmetto locust
pomegranate and many trailing tendrilled things both green and gray
Thenperhaps about half a century agoa few white fishermen cleared
a place for themselves in this grove and built a few palmetto
cottages with boathouses and a wharf facing the bayou Later on
this temporary fishing station became a permanent settlement homes
constructed of heavy timber and plaster mixed with the trailing moss of
the oaks and cypresses took the places of the frail and fragrant huts
of palmetto Still the population itself retained a floating character
it ebbed and came according to season and circumstances according to
luck or loss in the tilling of the sea Viosca the founder of the
settlement always remained he always managed to do well

He owned several luggers and sloops which were hired out upon
excellent terms he could make large and profitable contracts with New
Orleans fishdealers and he was vaguely suspected of possessing more
occult resources There were some confused stories current about his
having once been a daring smuggler and having only been reformed by
the pleadings of his wife Carmena little brown woman who had
followed him from Barcelona to share his fortunes in the western world

On hot days when the shade was full of thin sweet scents the place
had a tropical charm a drowsy peace Nothing except the peculiar
appearance of the line of oaks facing the Gulf could have conveyed to
the visitor any suggestion of days in which the trilling of crickets
and the fluting of birds had ceased of nights when the voices of the
marsh had been hushed for fear In one enormous rank the veteran trees
stood shoulder to shoulder but in the attitude of giants over
masteredforced backward towards the marshmade to recoil by the
might of the ghostly enemy with whom they had striven a thousand
yearsthe Shrieker the SkySweeper the awful SeaWind

Never had he given them so terrible a wrestle as on the night of the
tenth of August eighteen hundred and fiftysix All the waves of the
excited Gulf thronged in as if to see and lifted up their voices and
pushed and roared until the cheniere was islanded by such a billowing
as no white mans eyes had ever looked upon before Grandly the oaks
bore themselves but every fibre of their knotted thews was strained in
the unequal contest and two of the giants were overthrown upturning
as they fell roots coiled and huge as the serpentlimbs of Titans
Moved to its entrails all the islet trembled while the sea magnified
its menace and reached out whitely to the prostrate trees but the
rest of the oaks stood on and strove in line and saved the
habitations defended by them 


II

Before a little waxen image of the Mother and Childan odd little
Virgin with an Indian face brought home by Feliu as a gift after one
of his Mexican voyagesCarmen Viosca had burned candles and prayed
sometimes telling her beads sometimes murmuring the litanies she knew
by heart sometimes also reading from a prayerbook worn and greasy as
a longused pack of cards It was particularly stained at one page a
page on which her tears had fallen many a lonely nighta page with a
clumsy wood cut representing a celestial lamp a symbolic radiance
shining through darkness and on either side a kneeling angel with
folded wings And beneath this rudely wrought symbol of the Perpetual
Calm appeared in big coarse type the title of a prayer that has been
offered up through many a century doubtless by wives of Spanish
marinersContra las Tempestades

Once she became very much frightened After a partial lull the storm
had suddenly redoubled its force the ground shook the house quivered
and creaked the wind brayed and screamed and pushed and scuffled at
the door and the water which had been whipping in through every
crevice all at once rose over the threshold and flooded the dwelling
Carmen dipped her finger in the water and tasted it It was salt

And none of Felius boats had yet come indoubtless they had been
driven into some faraway bayous by the storm The only boat at the
settlement the Carmencita had been almost wrecked by running upon a
snag three days beforethere was at least a fortnights work for the
shipcarpenter of Dead Cypress Point And Feliu was sleeping as if
nothing unusual had happenedthe heavy sleep of a sailor heedless of
commotions and voices And his men Miguel and Mateo were at the
other end of the cheniere

With a scream Carmen aroused Feliu He raised himself upon his elbow
rubbed his eyes and asked her with exasperating calmness Que
tienes que tienes What ails thee

Oh Feliu the sea is coming upon us she answered in the same
tongue But she screamed out a word inspired by her fear she did not
cry Se nos viene el mar encima but Se nos viene LA ALTURAthe
name that conveys the terrible thought of depth swallowed up in
heightthe height of the high sea

No lo creo muttered Feliu looking at the floor then in a quiet
deep voice he said pointing to an oar in the corner of the room
Echame ese remo

She gave it to him Still reclining upon one elbow Feliu measured the
depth of the water with his thumb nail upon the blade of the oar and
then bade Carmen light his pipe for him His calmness reassured her
For half an hour more undismayed by the clamoring of the wind or the
calling of the sea Feliu silently smoked his pipe and watched his oar
The water rose a little higher and he made another markthen it
climbed a little more but not so rapidly and he smiled at Carmen as
he made a third mark Como creia he exclaimed no hay porque
asustarse el agua baja And as Carmen would have continued to pray
he rebuked her fears and bade her try to obtain some rest

Basta ya de plegarios queridavete y duerme His tone though
kindly was imperative and Carmen accustomed to obey him laid
herself down by his side and soon for very weariness slept

It was a feverish sleep nevertheless shattered at brief intervals by
terrible sounds sounds magnified by her nervous conditiona sleep
visited by dreams that mingled in a strange way with the impressions of
the storm and more than once made her heart stop and start again at
its own stopping One of these fancies she never could forgeta dream
about little ConchaConchita her firstborn who now slept far away
in the old churchyard at Barcelona She had tried to become
resignednot to think But the child would come back night after
night though the earth lay heavy upon hernight after night through
long distances of Time and Space Oh the fancied clinging of
infantlipsthe thrilling touch of little ghostly handsthose
phantomcaresses that torture mothers hearts  Night after night
through many a month of pain Then for a time the gentle presence
ceased to haunt herseemed to have lain down to sleep forever under
the high bright grass and yellow flowers Why did it return that
night of all nights to kiss her to cling to her to nestle in her
arms

For in her dream she thought herself still kneeling before the waxen
Image while the terrors of the tempest were ever deepening about
herraving of winds and booming of waters and a shaking of the land
And before her even as she prayed her dreamprayer the waxen Virgin
became tall as a woman and tallerrising to the roof and smiling as
she grew Then Carmen would have cried out for fear but that
something smothered her voiceparalyzed her tongue And the Virgin
silently stooped above her and placed in her arms the Childthe
brown Child with the Indian face And the Child whitened in her hands
and changedseeming as it changed to send a sharp pain through her
heart an old pain linked somehow with memories of bright windy
Spanish hills and summer scent of olive groves and all the luminous
Pastit looked into her face with the soft dark gaze with the
unforgotten smile of  dead Conchita

And Carmen wished to thank the smiling Virgin for that priceless
bliss and lifted up her eyes but the sickness of ghostly fear
returned upon her when she looked for now the Mother seemed as a woman
long dead and the smile was the smile of fleshlessness and the places
of the eyes were voids and darknesses  And the sea sent up so vast a
roar that the dwelling rocked

Carmen started from sleep to find her heart throbbing so that the couch
shook with it Night was growing gray the door had just been opened
and slammed again Through the rainwhipped panes she discerned the
passing shape of Feliu making for the beacha broad and bearded
silhouette bending against the wind Still the waxen Virgin smiled
her Mexican smilebut now she was only seven inches high and her
beadglass eyes seemed to twinkle with kindliness while the flame of
the last expiring taper struggled for life in the earthen socket at her
feet


III

Rain and a blind sky and a bursting sea Feliu and his men Miguel and
Mateo looked out upon the thundering and flashing of the monstrous
tide The wind had fallen and the gray air was full of gulls Behind
the cheniere back to the cloudy line of low woods many miles away
stretched a wash of leadcolored water with a green point piercing it
here and thereelbowbushes or wild cane tall enough to keep their
heads above the flood But the inundation was visibly
decreasingwith the passing of each hour more and more green patches
and points had been showing themselves by degrees the course of the
bayou had become definedtwo parallel winding lines of dwarftimber
and bushy shrubs traversing the water toward the distant
cypressswamps Before the cheniere all the shellbeach slope was piled
with wreckuptorn trees with the foliage still fresh upon them
splintered timbers of mysterious origin and logs in multitude scarred
with gashes of the axe Feliu and his comrades had saved wood enough
to build a little townworking up to their waists in the surf with
ropes poles and boathooks The whole sea was full of flotsam Voto
a Cristowhat a wrecking there must have been And to think the
Carmencita could not be taken out

They had seen other luggers making eastward during the morningcould
recognize some by their sails others by their gaitexaggerated in
their struggle with the pitching of the sea the San Pablo the
Gasparina the Enriqueta the Agueda the Constanza Ugly water
yesbut what a chance for wreckers  Some great ship must have
gone to piecesscores of casks were rolling in the troughcasks of
wine Perhaps it was the Manilaperhaps the Nautilus

A dead cow floated near enough for Mateo to throw his rope over one
horn and they all helped to get it out It was a milch cow of some
expensive breed and the owners brand had been burned upon the
hornsa monographic combination of the letters A and P Feliu said
he knew that brand Oldman Preaulx of BelleIsle who kept a sort of
dairy at Last Island during the summer season used to mark all his
cows that way Strange

But as they worked on they began to see stranger thingswhite dead
faces and dead hands which did not look like the hands or the faces of
drowned sailors the ebb was beginning to run strongly and these were
passing out with it on the other side of the mouth of the
bayouperhaps they had been washed into the marsh during the night
when the great rush of the sea came Then the three men left the water
and retired to higher ground to scan the furrowed Gulftheir
practiced eyes began to search the courses of the seacurrentskeen
as the gaze of birds that watch the wake of the plough And soon the
casks and the drift were forgotten for it seemed to them that the tide
was heavy with human deadpassing out processionally to the great
open Very far where the huge pitching of the swells was diminished by
distance into a mere fluttering of ripples the water appeared as if
sprinkled with themthey vanished and became visible again at
irregular intervals here and therefloating most thickly
eastwardtossing swaying patches of white or pink or blue or black
each with its tiny speck of fleshcolor showing as the sea lifted or
lowered the body Nearer to shore there were few but of these two
were close enough to be almost recognizable Miguel first discerned
them They were rising and falling where the water was deepestwell
out in front of the mouth of the bayou beyond the flooded sandbars
and moving toward the shellreef westward They were drifting almost
side by side One was that of a negro apparently well attired and
wearing a white apronthe other seemed to be a young colored girl
clad in a blue dress she was floating upon her face they could
observe that she had nearly straight hair braided and tied with a red
ribbon These were evidently houseservantsslaves But from
whence Nothing could be learned until the luggers should return and
none of them was yet in sight Still Feliu was not anxious as to the
fate of his boats manned by the best sailors of the coast Rarely are
these Louisiana fishermen lost in sudden storms even when to other
eyes the appearances are most pacific and the skies most splendidly
blue they divine some faroff danger like the gulls and like the
gulls also you see their light vessels fleeing landward These men
seem living barometers exquisitely sensitive to all the invisible
changes of atmospheric expansion and compression they are not easily
caught in those awful dead calms which suddenly paralyze the wings of a
bark and hold her helpless in their charmed circle as in a nightmare
until the blackness overtakes her and the longsleeping sea leaps up
foaming to devour her

Carajo

The word all at once bursts from Felius mouth with that peculiar
guttural snarl of the r betokening strong excitementwhile he
points to something rocking in the ebb beyond the foaming of the
shellreef under a circling of gulls More dead Yesbut something
too that lives and moves like a quivering speck of gold and Mateo
also perceives it a gleam of bright hairand Miguel likewise after
a moments gazing A living childa lifeless mother Pobrecita No
boat within reach and only a mighty surfwrestler could hope to swim
thither and return

But already without a word brown Feliu has stripped for the
struggleanother second and he is shooting through the surf head
and hands tunnelling the foam hills Onetwothree lines
passedfourthat is where they first begin to crumble white from
the summitfivethat he can ride fearlessly  Then swiftly
easily he advances with a long powerful breaststrokekeeping his
bearded head well up to watch for driftseeming to slide with a swing
from swell to swellascending sinkingalternately presenting
breast or shoulder to the wave always diminishing more and more to the
eyes of Mateo and Migueltill he becomes a moving speck occasionally
hard to follow through the confusion of heaping waters  You are not
afraid of the sharks Feliuno they are afraid of you right and
left they slunk away from your coming that morning you swam for life in
WestIndian waters with your knife in your teeth while the balls of
the Cuban coastguard were purring all around you That day the
swarming sea was warmwarm like soupand clear with an emerald
flash in every ripplenot opaque and clamorous like the Gulf today
 Miguel and his comrade are anxious Ropes are unrolled and
interknotted into a line Miguel remains on the beach but Mateo
bearing the end of the line fights his way outswimming and wading
by turns to the further sandbar where the water is shallow enough to
stand inif you know how to jump when the breaker comes

But Feliu nearing the flooded shellbank watches the white
flashingsknows when the time comes to keep flat and take a long
long breath One heavy volleying of foamdarkness and hissing as of
a steamburst a vibrant lifting up a rush into lightand again the
volleying and the seething darkness Once moreand the fight is won
He feels the upcoming chill of deeper watersees before him the green
quaking of unbroken swellsand far beyond him Mateo leaping on the
barand beside him almost within arms reach a great billiardtable
swaying and a dead woman clinging there and  the child

A moment more and Feliu has lifted himself beside the waifs  How
fast the dead woman clings as if with the one power which is strong as
deaththe desperate force of love Not in vain for the frail
creature bound to the mothers corpse with a silken scarf has still the
strength to cry outMaman maman But time is life now and the
tiny hands must be pulled away from the fair dead neck and the scarf
taken to bind the infant firmly to Felius broad shouldersquickly
roughly for the ebb will not wait 

And now Feliu has a burden but his style of swimming has totally
changedhe rises from the water like a Triton and his powerful arms
seem to spin in circles like the spokes of a flying wheel For now is
the wrestle indeedafter each passing swell comes a prodigious
pulling from beneaththe sea clutching for its prey

But the reef is gained is passedthe wild horses of the deep seem to
know the swimmer who has learned to ride them so well And still the
brown arms spin in an evernearing mist of spray and the outer
sandbar is not far offand there is shouting Mateo leaping in the
surf swinging something about his head as a vaquero swings his noose
 Sough splashit struggles in the trough beside Feliu and the
sinewy hand descends upon it Tienetira Miguel And their feet
touch land again 

She is very cold the child and very still with eyes closed

Esta muerta Feliu asks Mateo

No the panting swimmer makes answer emerging while the waves
reach whitely up the sand as in pursuitno vive respira todavia

Behind him the deep lifts up its million hands and thunders as in
acclaim


IV

Madre de Diosmi sueno screamed Carmen abandoning her
preparations for the morning meal as Feliu nude like a marine god
rushed in and held out to her a dripping and gasping
babygirlMother of God my dream But there was no time then to
tell of dreams the child might die In one instant Carmens quick
deft hands had stripped the slender little body and while Mateo and
Feliu were finding dry clothing and stimulants and Miguel telling how
it all happenedquickly passionately with furious gesturethe kind
and vigorous woman exerted all her skill to revive the flickering life
Soon Feliu came to aid her while his men set to work completing the
interrupted preparation of the breakfast Flannels were heated for the
friction of the frail limbs and brandyandwater warmed which Carmen
administered by the spoonful skilfully as any physicianuntil at
last the little creature opened her eyes and began to sob Sobbing
still she was laid in Carmens warm featherbed well swathed in
woollen wrappings The immediate danger at least was over and Feliu
smiled with pride and pleasure

Then Carmen first ventured to relate her dream and his face became
grave again Husband and wife gazed a moment into each others eyes
feeling together the same strange thrillthat mysterious faint
creeping as of a wind passing which is the awe of the Unknowable
Then they looked at the child lying there pink checked with the flush
of the blood returning and such a sudden tenderness touched them as
they had known long years before while together bending above the
slumbering loveliness of lost Conchita

Que ojos murmured Feliu as he turned awayfeigning hunger 
He was not hungry but his sight had grown a little dim as with a
mist Que ojos They were singular eyes large dark and wonderfully
fringed The childs hair was yellowit was the flash of it that had
saved her yet her eyes and brows were beautifully black She was
comely but with such a curious delicate comelinesstotally unlike
the robust beauty of Concha  At intervals she would moan a little
between her sobs and at last cried out with a thin shrill cry
Mamanoh maman Then Carmen lifted her from the bed to her lap
and caressed her and rocked her gently to and fro as she had done
many a night for ConchamurmuringYo sere tu madre angel mio
dulzura miasere tu madrecita palomita mia I will be thy mother
my angel my sweetI will be thy little mother my doveling And the
long silk fringes of the childs eyes overlapped shadowed her little
cheeks and she sleptjust as Conchita had slept long agowith her
head on Carmens bosom

Feliu reappeared at the inner door at a sign he approached
cautiously without noise and looked

She can talk whispered Carmen in Spanish she called her
motherha llamado a su madre

Y Dios tambien la ha llamado responded Feliu with rude
pathosAnd God also called her

But the Virgin sent us the child Feliusent us the child for
Conchas sake

He did not answer at once he seemed to be thinking very
deeplyCarmen anxiously scanned his impassive face

Who knows he answered at lastwho knows Perhaps she has
ceased to belong to any one else

One after another Felius luggers fluttered inbearing with them
news of the immense calamity And all the fishermen in turn looked
at the child Not one had ever seen her before


V

Ten days later a lugger full of armed men entered the bayou and
moored at Vioscas wharf The visitors were for the most part
country gentlemenresidents of Franklin and neighboring towns or
planters from the Teche countryforming one of the numerous
expeditions organized for the purpose of finding the bodies of
relatives or friends lost in the great hurricane and of punishing the
robbers of the dead They had searched numberless nooks of the coast
had given sepulture to many corpses had recovered a large amount of
jewelry andas Feliu afterward learnedhad summarily tried and
executed several of the most abandoned class of wreckers found with
illgotten valuables in their possession and convicted of having
mutilated the drowned But they came to Vioscas landing only to obtain
informationhe was too well known and liked to be a subject for
suspicion and moreover he had one good friend in the crowdCaptain
Harris of New Orleans a veteran steamboat man and a market contractor
to whom he had disposed of many a cargo of fresh pompano sheepshead
and Spanishmackerel  Harris was the first to step to landsome
ten of the party followed him Nearly all had lost some relative or
friend in the great catastrophethe gathering was serious
silentalmost grimwhich formed about Feliu

Mateo who had come to the country while a boy spoke English better
than the rest of the cheniere peoplehe acted as interpreter whenever
Feliu found any difficulty in comprehending or answering questions and
he told them of the child rescued that wild morning and of Felius
swim His recital evoked a murmur of interest and excitement followed
by a confusion of questions Well they could see for themselves
Feliu said but he hoped they would have a little patiencethe child
was still weakit might be dangerous to startle her Well arrange
it just as you like responded the captaingo ahead Feliu 

All proceeded to the house under the great trees Feliu and Captain
Harris leading the way It was sultry and brighteven the seabreeze
was warm there were pleasant odors in the shade and a soporific
murmur made of leafspeech and the hum of gnats Only the captain
entered the house with Feliu the rest remained withoutsome taking
seats on a rude plank bench under the oaksothers flinging themselves
down upon the weedsa few stood still leaning upon their rifles
Then Carmen came out to them with gourds and a bucket of fresh water
which all were glad to drink

They waited many minutes Perhaps it was the cool peace of the place
that made them all feel how hot and tired they were conversation
flagged and the general languor finally betrayed itself in a silence
so absolute that every leafwhisper seemed to become separately audible

It was broken at last by the guttural voice of the old captain emerging
from the cottage leading the child by the hand and followed by Carmen
and Feliu All who had been resting rose up and looked at the child

Standing in a lighted space with one tiny hand enveloped by the
captains great brown fist she looked so lovely that a general
exclamation of surprise went up Her bright hair loose and steeped in
the sunflame illuminated her like a halo and her large dark eyes
gentle and melancholy as a deers watched the strange faces before her
with shy curiosity She wore the same dress in which Feliu had found
hera soft white fabric of muslin with trimmings of ribbon that had
once been blue and the now discolored silken scarf which had twice
done her such brave service was thrown over her shoulders Carmen had
washed and repaired the dress very creditably but the tiny slim feet
were barethe brinesoaked shoes she wore that fearful night had
fallen into shreds at the first attempt to remove them

Gentlemen said Captain Harriswe can find no clew to the
identity of this child There is no mark upon her clothing and she
wore nothing in the shape of jewelryexcept this string of coral
beads We are nearly all Americans here and she does not speak any
English  Does any one here know anything about her

Carmen felt a great sinking at her heart was her newfound darling to
be taken so soon from her But no answer came to the captains query
No one of the expedition had ever seen that child before The coral
beads were passed from hand to hand the scarf was minutely scrutinized
without avail Somebody asked if the child could not talk German or
Italian

Italiano No said Feliu shaking his head One of his
luggermen Gioachino Sparicio who though a Sicilian could speak
several Italian idioms besides his own had already essayed

She speaks something or other answered the captainbut no
English I couldnt make her understand me and Feliu who talks
nearly all the infernal languages spoken down this way says he cant
make her understand him Suppose some of you who know French talk to
her a bit  Laroussel why dont you try

The young man addressed did not at first seem to notice the captains
suggestion He was a tall lithe fellow with a dark positive face
he had never removed his black gaze from the child since the moment of
her appearance Her eyes too seemed to be all for himto return his
scrutiny with a sort of vague pleasure a half savage confidence 
Was it the first embryonic feeling of raceaffinity quickening in the
little brainsome intuitive inexplicable sense of kindred She
shrank from Doctor Hecker who addressed her in German shook her head
at Lawyer Solari who tried to make her answer in Italian and her look
always went back plaintively to the dark sinister face of
LarousselLaroussel who had calmly taken a human life a wicked human
life only the evening before

Laroussel youre the only Creole in this crowd said the captain
talk to her Talk gumbo to her  Ive no doubt this child knows
German very well and Italian toohe added maliciouslybut not in
the way you gentlemen pronounce it

Laroussel handed his rifle to a friend crouched down before the little
girl and looked into her face and smiled Her great sweet orbs shone
into his one moment seriously as if searching and then  she
returned his smile It seemed to touch something latent within the
man something rare for his whole expression changed and there was a
caress in his look and voice none of the men could have believed
possibleas he exclaimed

Fais moin bo piti

She pouted up her pretty lips and kissed his black moustache

He spoke to her again

Dis moin to nom pitidis moin to nom chere

Then for the first time she spoke answering in her argent treble

Zouzoune

All held their breath Captain Harris lifted his finger to his lips to
command silence

Zouzoune Zouzoune qui chere

Zouzoune a cest moin Lili

Cest pas tout to nom Lilidis moin chere to laut nom

Mo pas connin laut nom

Comment ye te pele to maman piti

MamanMaman Dele

Et comment ye te pele to papa chere

Papa Zulien

Bon Et comment to maman te pele to papadis ca a moin chere

The child looked down put a finger in her mouth thought a moment and
replied

Li pele li Cheri li pele li Papoute

Aie aiecest tout cato maman te jamain pele li daut chose

Mo pas connin moin

She began to play with some trinkets attached to his watch chaina
very small gold compass especially impressed her fancy by the trembling
and flashing of its tiny needle and she murmured coaxingly

Mo oule ca Donnin ca a moin

He took all possible advantage of the situation and replied at once

Oui mo va donnin toi ca si to di moin to laut nom

The splendid bribe evidently impressed her greatly for tears rose to
the brown eyes as she answered

Mo pas capab di camo pas capab di laut nom  Mo oule mo pas
capab

Laroussel explained The childs name was Liliperhaps a contraction
of Eulalie and her pet Creole name Zouzoune He thought she must be
the daughter of wealthy people but she could not for some reason or
other tell her family name Perhaps she could not pronounce it well
and was afraid of being laughed at some of the old French names were
very hard for Creole children to pronounce so long as the little ones
were indulged in the habit of talking the patois and after a certain
age their mispronunciations would be made fun of in order to accustom
them to abandon the idiom of the slavenurses and to speak only
French Perhaps again she was really unable to recall the name
certain memories might have been blurred in the delicate brain by the
shock of that terrible night She said her mothers name was Adele
and her fathers Julien but these were very common names in
Louisianaand could afford scarcely any better clew than the innocent
statement that her mother used to address her father as dear
Cherior with the Creole diminutive little papa Papoute Then
Laroussel tried to reach a clew in other ways without success He
asked her about where she livedwhat the place was like and she told
him about figtrees in a court and galleries and banquettes and
spoke of a faubouwithout being able to name any street He asked
her what her father used to do and was assured that he did
everythingthat there was nothing he could not do Divine absurdity
of childish faithinfinite artlessness of childish love  Probably
the little girls parents had been residents of New Orleansdwellers
of the old colonial quarterthe faubourg the faubou

Well gentlemen said Captain Harris as Laroussel abandoned his
crossexamination in despairall we can do now is to make inquiries
I suppose wed better leave the child here She is very weak yet and
in no condition to be taken to the city right in the middle of the hot
season and nobody could care for her any better than shes being cared
for here Then again seems to me that as Feliu saved her lifeand
that at the risk of his ownhes got the prior claim anyhow and his
wife is just crazy about the childwants to adopt her If we can find
her relatives so much the better but I say gentlemen let them come
right here to Feliu themselves and thank him as he ought to be
thanked by God Thats just what I think about it

Carmen understood the little speechall the Spanish charm of her
youth had faded out years before but in the one swift look of
gratitude she turned upon the captain it seemed to blossom againfor
that quick moment she was beautiful

The captain is quite right observed Dr Hecker it would be very
dangerous to take the child away just now There was no dissent

All correct boys asked the captain  Well weve got to be
going Byby Zouzoune

But Zouzoune burst into tears Laroussel was going too

Give her the thing Laroussel she gave you a kiss anyhowmore
than shed do for me cried the captain

Laroussel turned detached the little compass from his watch chain and
gave it to her She held up her pretty face for his farewell kiss 


VI

But it seemed fated that Felius waif should never be
identifieddiligent inquiry and printed announcements alike proved
fruitless Sea and sand had either hidden or effaced all the records
of the little world they had engulfed the annihilation of whole
families the extinction of races had in more than one instance
rendered vain all efforts to recognize the dead It required the
subtle perception of long intimacy to name remains tumefied and
discolored by corruption and exposure mangled and gnawed by fishes by
reptiles and by birdsit demanded the great courage of love to look
upon the eyeless faces found sweltering in the blackness of
cypressshadows under the low palmettoes of the swampswhere gorged
buzzards started from sleep or cottonmouths uncoiled hissing at the
coming of the searchers And sometimes all who had loved the lost were
themselves among the missing The full roll call of names could never
be made out extraordinary mistakes were committed Men whom the world
deemed dead and buried came back like ghoststo read their own
epitaphs

 Almost at the same hour that Laroussel was questioning the child in
Creole patois another expedition searching for bodies along the
coast discovered on the beach of a low islet famed as a haunt of
pelicans the corpse of a child Some locks of bright hair still
adhering to the skull a string of red beads a white muslin dress a
handkerchief broidered with the initials ALBwere secured as
clews and the little body was interred where it had been found

And several days before Captain Hotard of the reliefboat Estelle
Brousseaux had found drifting in the open Gulf latitude 26 degrees
43 minutes longitude 88 degrees 17 minutesthe corpse of a
fairhaired woman clinging to a table The body was disfigured beyond
recognition even the slender bones of the hands had been stripped by
the nibs of the seabirdsexcept one finger the third of the left
which seemed to have been protected by a ring of gold as by a charm
Graven within the plain yellow circlet was a dateJUILLET1851
and the namesADELE  JULIENseparated by a cross The Estelle
carried coffins that day most of them were already full but there
was one for Adele

Who was shewho was her Julien  When the Estelle and many other
vessels had discharged their ghastly cargoeswhen the bereaved of the
land had assembled as hastily as they might for the du y of
identificationwhen memories were strained almost to madness in
research of names dates incidentsfor the evocation of dead words
resurrection of vanished days recollection of dear promisesthen in
the confusion it was believed and declared that the little corpse
found on the pelican island was the daughter of the wearer of the
wedding ring Adele La Brierre nee Florane wife of Dr Julien La
Brierre of New Orleans who was numbered among the missing

And they brought dead Adele backup shadowy river windings over
linked brightnesses of lake and lakelet through many a green
glimmering bayouto the Creole city and laid her to rest somewhere
in the old SaintLouis Cemetery And upon the tablet recording her
name were also graven the words

VII

Yet six months afterward the face of Julien La Brierre was seen again
upon the streets of New Orleans Men started at the sight of him as
at a spectre standing in the sun And nevertheless the apparition cast
a shadow People paused approached half extended a hand through old
habit suddenly checked themselves and passed onwondering they
should have forgotten asking themselves why they had so nearly made an
absurd mistake

It was a February dayone of those crystalline days of our snowless
Southern winter when the air is clear and cool and outlines sharpen
in the light as if viewed through the focus of a diamond glassand in
that brightness Julien La Brierre perused his own brief epitaph and
gazed upon the sculptured name of drowned Adele Only half a year had
passed since she was laid away in the high wall of tombsin that
strange colonial columbarium where the dead slept in rows behind
squared marbles lettered in black or bronze Yet her
restingplacein the highest rangealready seemed old Under our
Southern sun the vegetation of cemeteries seems to spring into being
spontaneouslyto leap all suddenly into luxuriant life Microscopic
mossy growths had begun to mottle the slab that closed her inover
its face some singular creeper was crawling planting tiny reptilefeet
into the chiselled letters of the inscription and from the moist soil
below speckled euphorbias were growing up to herand morning
gloriesand beautiful green tangled things of which he did not know
the name

And the sight of the pretty lizards puffing their crimson pouches in
the sun or undulating athwart epitaphs and shifting their color when
approached from emerald to ashengraythe caravans of the ants
journeying to and from tiny chinks in the masonrythe bees gathering
honey from the crimson blossoms of the cretedecoq whose radicles
sought sustenance perhaps from human dust in the decay of
generationsall that rich life of graves summoned up fancies of
Resurrection Natures resurrectionworkwondrous transformations of
flesh marvellous bans migration of souls  From some forgotten
crevice of that tomb roof which alone intervened between her and the
vast light a sturdy weed was growing He knew that plant as it
quivered against the bluethe chougras as Creole children call it
its dark berries form the mockingbirds favorite food  Might not its
roots exploring darkness have found some unfamiliar nutriment
withinmight it not be that something of the dead heart had risen to
purple and emerald lifein the sap of translucent leaves in the wine
of the savage berriesto blend with the blood of the Wizard
Singerto lend a strange sweetness to the melody of his wooing 

 Seldom indeed does it happen that a man in the prime of youth in
the possession of wealth habituated to comforts and the elegances of
life discovers in one brief week how minute his true relation to the
human aggregatehow insignificant his part as one living atom of the
social organism Seldom at the age of twentyeight has one been made
able to comprehend through experience alone that in the vast and
complex Stream of Being he counts for less than a drop and that even
as the blood loses and replaces its corpuscles without a variance in
the volume and vigor of its current so are individual existences
eliminated and replaced in the pulsing of a peoples life with never a
pause in its mighty murmur But all this and much more Julien had
learned in seven merciless daysseven successive and terrible shocks
of experience The enormous world had not missed him and his place
therein was not voidsociety had simply forgotten him So long as he
had moved among them all he knew for friends had performed their petty
altruistic roleshad discharged their small human obligationshad
kept turned toward him the least selfish side of their natureshad
made with him a tolerably equitable exchange of ideas and of favors
and after his disappearance from their midst they had duly mourned for
his lossto themselves They had played out the final act in the
unimportant drama of his life it was really asking too much to demand
a repetition  Impossible to deceive himself as to the feeling his
unanticipated return had arousedfeigned pity where he had looked for
sympathetic welcome dismay where he had expected surprised delight
and oftener airs of resignation or disappointment ill
disguisedalways insincerity politely masked or coldly bare He had
come back to find strangers in his home relatives at law concerning
his estate and himself regarded as an intruder among the livingan
unlucky guest a revenant  How hollow and selfish a world it seemed
And yet there was love in it he had been loved in it unselfishly
passionately with the love of father and of mother of wife and child
 All buriedall lost forever  Oh would to God the story of
that stone were not a liewould to kind God he also were dead 

Evening shadowed the violet deepened and prickled itself with
starsthe sun passed below the west leaving in his wake a momentary
splendor of vermilion  our Southern day is not prolonged by
gloaming And Juliens thoughts darkened with the darkening and as
swiftly For while there was yet light to see he read another name
that he used to knowthe name of RAMIREZ  Nacio en Cienfuegos isla
de Cuba  Wherefore bornfor what eternal purpose Ramirezin the
City of a Hundred Fires He had blown out his brains before the
sepulchre of his young wife  It was a detached double vault shaped
like a huge chest and much dilapidated alreadyunder the continuous
burrowing of the crawfish it had sunk greatly on one side tilting as
if about to fall Out from its zigzag fissurings of brick and plaster
a sinister voice seemed to comeGo thou and do likewise  Earth
groans with her burthen even nowthe burthen of Man she holds no
place for thee


VIII

 That voice pursued him into the darkness of his chilly
roomhaunted him in the silence of his lodging And then began
within the man that ghostly struggle between courage and despair
between patient reason and mad revolt between weakness and force
between darkness and light which all sensitive and generous natures
must wage in their own souls at least onceperhaps many timesin
their lives Memory in such moments plays like an electric
stormall involuntarily he found himself reviewing his life

Incidents long forgotten came back with singular vividness he saw the
Past as he had not seen it while it was the Presentremembrances of
home recollections of infancy recurred to him with terrible
intensitythe artless pleasures and the trifling griefs the little
hurts and the tender pettings the hopes and the anxieties of those who
loved him the smiles and tears of slaves  And his first Creole
pony a present from his father the day after he had proved himself
able to recite his prayers correctly in French without one
mispronunciationwithout saying crasse for graceand yellow Michel
who taught him to swim and to fish and to paddle a pirogueand the
bayou with its wonderworld of turtles and birds and creeping
thingsand his German tutor who could not pronounce the jand the
songs of the canefieldsstrangely pleasing full of quaverings and
long plaintive notes like the call of the cranes  Tou tou pays
blanc  Afterward Camaniere had leased the placeeverything must
have been changed even the songs could not be the same Tou tou
pays blareDanie qui commande 

And then Paris and the university with its wild underlifesome
debts some follies and the frequent fond letters from home to which
he might have replied so much oftenerParis where talent is
mediocrity Paris with its thunders and its splendors and its seething
of passionParis supreme focus of human endeavor with its madnesses
of art its frenzied striving to express the Inexpressible its
spasmodic strainings to clutch the Unattainable its soarings of
soulfire to the heaven of the Impossible 

What a rejoicing there was at his returnhow radiant and level the
long Road of the Future seemed to open before himeverywhere
friends prospects felicitations Then his first serious loveand
the night of the ball at St Martinsvillethe vision of light
Gracile as a palm and robed at once so simply so exquisitely in
white she had seemed to him the supreme realization of all possible
dreams of beauty  And his passionate jealousy and the slap from
Laroussel and the humiliating twominute duel with rapiers in which he
learned that he had found his master The scar was deep Why had not
Laroussel killed him then  Not evilhearted Larousselthey
used to salute each other afterward when they met and Laroussels
smile was kindly Why had he refrained from returning it Where was
Laroussel now

For the death of his generous father who had sacrificed so much to
reform him for the death only a short while after of his
allforgiving mother he had found one sweet woman to console him with
her tender words her loving lips her delicious caress She had given
him Zouzoune the darling link between their livesZouzoune who
waited each evening with black Eglantine at the gate to watch for his
coming and to cry through all the house like a bird Papa lape
vinipapa Zulien ape vini  And once that she had made him very
angry by upsetting the ink over a mass of business papers and he had
slapped her could he ever forgive himselfshe had cried through
her sobs of astonishment and painTo laimin mointo batte moin
Thou lovest methou beatest me Next month she would have been five
years old To laimin mointo batte moin 

A furious paroxysm of grief convulsed him suffocated him it seemed to
him that something within must burst must break He flung himself
down upon his bed biting the coverings in order to stifle his outcry
to smother the sounds of his despair What crime had he ever done oh
God that he should be made to suffer thuswas it for this he had
been permitted to live had been rescued from the sea and carried
round all the world unscathed Why should he live to remember to
suffer to agonize Was not Ramirez wiser

How long the contest within him lasted he never knew but ere it was
done he had become in more ways than one a changed man For the
firstthough not indeed for the last timesomething of the deeper
and nobler comprehension of human weakness and of human suffering had
been revealed to himsomething of that larger knowledge without which
the sense of duty can never be fully acquired nor the understanding of
unselfish goodness nor the spirit of tenderness The suicide is not a
coward he is an egotist

A ray of sunlight touched his wet pillowawoke him He rushed to the
window flung the latticed shutters apart and looked out

Something beautiful and ghostly filled all the vistasfrosthaze and
in some queer way the mist had momentarily caught and held the very
color of the sky An azure fog Through it the quaint and checkered
streetas yet but half illumined by the suntook tones of impossible
color the view paled away through faint bluish tints into transparent
purplesall the shadows were indigo How sweet the morninghow
well life seemed worth living Because the sun had shown his face
through a fairy veil of frost 

Who was the ancient thinkerwas it Hermeswho said

The Sun is Laughter for tis He who maketh joyous the thoughts of
men and gladdeneth the infinite world 



The Shadow of the Tide

I

Carmen found that her little pet had been taught how to pray for each
night and morning when the devout woman began to make her orisons the
child would kneel beside her with little hands joined and in a voice
sweet and clear murmur something she had learned by heart Much as
this pleased Carmen it seemed to her that the childs prayers could
not be wholly valid unless uttered in Spanishfor Spanish was
heavens own tonguela lengua de Dios el idioma de Dios and she
resolved to teach her to say the Salve Maria and the Padre Nuestro in
Castilianalso her own favorite prayer to the Virgin beginning with
the words Madre santisima toda dulce y hermosa   

So Conchitafor a new name had been given to her with that terrible
sea christeningreceived her first lessons in Spanish and she proved
a most intelligent pupil Before long she could prattle to Feliushe
would watch for his return of evenings and announce his coming with
Aqui viene mi papacitoshe learned too from Carmen many little
caresses of speech to greet him with Felius was not a joyous nature
he had his dark hours his sombre days yet it was rarely that he felt
too sullen to yield to the little ones petting when she would leap up
to reach his neck and to coax his kiss withDame un beso
papaasiy otro otro otro He grew to love her like his
ownwas she not indeed his own since he had won her from death And
none had yet come to dispute his claim More and more with the
passing of weeks months seasons she became a portion of his lifea
part of all that he wrought for At the first he had had a
halfformed hope that the little one might be reclaimed by relatives
generous and rich enough to insist upon his acceptance of a handsome
compensation and that Carmen could find some solace in a pleasant
visit to Barceloneta But now he felt that no possible generosity
could requite him for her loss and with the unconscious selfishness of
affection he commenced to dread her identification as a great calamity

It was evident that she had been brought up nicely She had pretty
prim ways of drinking and eating queer little fashions of sitting in
company and of addressing people She had peculiar notions about
colors in dress about wearing her hair and she seemed to have already
imbibed a small stock of social prejudices not altogether in harmony
with the republicanism of Vioscas Point Occasional swarthy
visitorsmen of the Manilla settlementsshe spoke of contemptuously
as neguesmarrons and once she shocked Carmen inexpressibly by
stopping in the middle of her evening prayer declaring that she wanted
to say her prayers to a white Virgin Carmens Senora de Guadalupe was
only a negra Then for the first time Carmen spoke so crossly to the
child as to frighten her But the pious womans heart smote her the
next moment for that first harsh wordand she caressed the motherless
one consoled her cheered her and at last explained to herI know
not howsomething very wonderful about the little figurine something
that made Chitas eyes big with awe Thereafter she always regarded
the Virgin of Wax as an object mysterious and holy

And one by one most of Chitas little eccentricities were gradually
eliminated from her developing life and thought More rapidly than
ordinary children because singularly intelligent she learned to adapt
herself to all the changes of her new environmentretaining only that
indescribable something which to an experienced eye tells of hereditary
refinement of habit and of minda natural grace a thoroughbred ease
and elegance of movement a quickness and delicacy of perception

She became strong again and activeactive enough to play a great deal
on the beach when the sun was not too fierce and Carmen made a canvas
bonnet to shield her head and face Never had she been allowed to play
so much in the sun before and it seemed to do her good though her
little bare feet and hands became brown as copper At first it must
be confessed she worried her fostermother a great deal by various
queer misfortunes and extraordinary freaksgetting bitten by crabs
falling into the bayou while in pursuit of fiddlers or losing
herself at the conclusion of desperate efforts to run races at night
with the moon or to walk to the end of the world If she could only
once get to the edge of the sky she said she could climb up She
wanted to see the stars which were the souls of good little children
and she knew that God would let her climb up Just what I am afraid
ofthought Carmen to herselfHe might let her climb upa little
ghost But one day naughty Chita received a terrible lessona
lasting lessonwhich taught her the value of obedience

She had been particularly cautioned not to venture into a certain part
of the swamp in the rear of the grove where the weeds were very tall
for Carmen was afraid some snake might bite the child

But Chitas birdbright eye had discerned a gleam of white in that
direction and she wanted to know what it was The white could only be
seen from one point behind the furthest house where the ground was
high Never go there said Carmen there is a Dead Man therewill
bite you And yet one day while Carmen was unusually busy Chita
went there

In the early days of the settlement a Spanish fisherman had died and
his comrades had built him a little tomb with the surplus of the same
bricks and other material brought down the bayou for the construction
of Vioscas cottages But no one except perhaps some wandering duck
hunter had approached the sepulchre for years High weeds and grasses
wrestled together all about it and rendered it totally invisible from
the surrounding level of the marsh

Fiddlers swarmed away as Chita advanced over the moist soil each
uplifting its single huge claw as it sidled offthen frogs began to
leap before her as she reached the thicker grassand longlegged
brown insects sprang showering to right and left as she parted the
tufts of the thickening verdure As she went on the bitterweeds
disappearedjointed grasses and sinewy dark plants of a taller growth
rose above her head she was almost deafened by the storm of insect
shrilling and the mosquitoes became very wicked All at once
something long and black and heavy wriggled almost from under her naked
feetsquirming so horribly that for a minute or two she could not
move for fright But it slunk away somewhere and hid itself the weeds
it had shaken ceased to tremble in its wake and her courage returned
She felt such an exquisite and fearful pleasure in the gratification of
that naughty curiosity Then quite unexpectedlyoh what a start it
gave herthe solitary white object burst upon her view leprous and
ghastly as the yawn of a cottonmouth Tombs ruin soon in
Louisianathe one Chita looked upon seemed ready to topple down
There was a great ragged hole at one end where wind and rain and
perhaps also the burrowing of crawfish and of worms had loosened the
bricks and caused them to slide out of place It seemed very black
inside but Chita wanted to know what was there She pushed her way
through a gap in the thin and rotten line of pickets and through some
tall weeds with big coarse pink flowersthen she crouched down on
hands and knees before the black hole and peered in It was not so
black inside as she had thought for a sunbeam slanted down through a
chink in the roof and she could see

A brown headwithout hair without eyes but with teeth ever so many
teethseemed to laugh at her and close to it sat a Toad the hugest
she had ever seen and the white skin of his throat kept puffing out
and going in And Chita screamed and screamed and fled in wild
terrorscreaming all the way till Carmen ran out to meet her and
carry her home Even when safe in her adopted mothers arms she
sobbed with fright To the vivid fancy of the child there seemed to be
some hideous relation between the staring reptile and the brown
deathshead with its empty eyes and its nightmaresmile

The shock brought on a fevera fever that lasted several days and
left her very weak But the experience taught her to obey taught her
that Carmen knew best what was for her good It also caused her to
think a great deal Carmen had told her that the dead people never
frightened good little girls who stayed at home

Madrecita Carmen she asked is my mamma dead

Pobrecita  Yes my angel God called her to Himyour darling
mother

Madrecita she asked againher young eyes growing vast with
horroris my own mamma now like That  She pointed toward the
place of the white gleam behind the great trees

No no no my darling cried Carmen appalled herself by the
ghastly questionyour mamma is with the dear good loving God who
lives in the beautiful sky above the clouds my darling beyond the
sun

But Carmens kind eyes were full of tears and the child read their
meaning He who teareth off the Mask of the Flesh had looked into her
face one unutterable momentshe had seen the brutal Truth naked to
the bone

Yet there came to her a little thrill of consolation caused by the
words of the tender falsehood for that which she had discerned by day
could not explain to her that which she saw almost nightly in her
slumber The face the voice the form of her loving mother still
lived somewherecould not have utterly passed away since the sweet
presence came to her in dreams bending and smiling over her caressing
her speaking to hersometimes gently chiding but always chiding
with a kiss And then the child would laugh in her sleep and prattle
in Creoletalking to the luminous shadow telling the dead mother all
the little deeds and thoughts of the day Why would God only let her
come at night

 Her idea of God had been first defined by the sight of a quaint
French picture of the Creationan engraving which represented a
shoreless sea under a black sky and out of the blackness a solemn and
bearded gray head emerging and a cloudy hand through which stars
glimmered God was like old Doctor de Coulanges who used to visit the
house and talk in a voice like a low roll of thunder At a later
day when Chita had been told that God was everywhere at the same time
without and within beneath and above all thingsthis idea became
somewhat changed The awful bearded face the huge shadowy hand did
not fade from her thought but they became fantastically blended with
the larger and vaguer notion of something that filled the world and
reached to the starssomething diaphanous and incomprehensible like
the invisible air omnipresent and everlasting like the high blue of
heaven 


II

 She began to learn the life of the coast

With her acquisition of another tongue there came to her also the
understanding of many things relating to the world of the sea She
memorized with novel delight much that was told her day by day
concerning the nature surrounding hermany secrets of the air many
of those signs of heaven which the dwellers in cities cannot comprehend
because the atmosphere is thickened and made stagnant above
themcannot even watch because the horizon is hidden from their eyes
by walls and by weary avenues of trees with whitewashed trunks She
learned by listening by asking by observing also how to know the
signs that foretell wild weathertremendous sunsets scuddings and
bridgings of cloudsharpening and darkening of the sealineand the
shriek of gulls flashing to land in level flight out of a still
transparent skyand halos about the moon

She learned where the seabirds with white bosoms and brown wings
made their hidden nests of sandand where the cranes waded for their
preyand where the beautiful wildducks plumaged in satiny lilac and
silken green found their foodand where the best reeds grew to
furnish stems for Felius redclay pipeand where the ruddy seabeans
were most often tossed upon the shoreand how the gray pelicans
fished all together like menmoving in farextending semicircles
beating the flood with their wings to drive the fish before them

And from Carmen she learned the fables and the sayings of the seathe
proverbs about its deafness its avarice its treachery its terrific
powerespecially one that haunted her for all time thereafter Si
quieres aprender a orar entra en el mar If thou wouldst learn to
pray go to the sea She learned why the sea is salthow the tears
of women made the waves of the seaand how the sea has ii no
friendsand how the cats eyes change with the tides

What had she lost of life by her swift translation from the dusty
existence of cities to the open immensity of natures freedom What did
she gain

Doubtless she was saved from many of those little bitternesses and
restraints and disappointments which all wellbred city children must
suffer in the course of their training for the more or less factitious
life of societyobligations to remain very still with every nimble
nerve quivering in dumb revoltthe injustice of being found
troublesome and being sent to bed early for the comfort of her
eldersthe cruel necessity of straining her pretty eyes for many
long hours at a time over grimy desks in gloomy schoolrooms though
birds might twitter and bright winds flutter in the trees withoutthe
austere constrains and heavy drowsiness of warm churches filled with
the droning echoes of a voice preaching incomprehensible thingsthe
progressively augmenting weariness of lessons in deportment in
dancing in music in the impossible art of keeping her dresses
unruffled and unsoiled Perhaps she never had any reason to regret all
these

She went to sleep and awakened with the wild birdsher life remained
as unfettered by formalities as her fine feet by shoes Excepting
Carmens old prayerbookin which she learned to read a littleher
childhood passed without booksalso without pictures without
dainties without music without theatrical amusements But she saw
and heard and felt much of that which though old as the heavens and
the earth is yet eternally new and eternally young with the holiness
of beautyeternally mystical and divineeternally weird the
unveiled magnificence of Natures moodsthe perpetual poem hymned by
wind and surgethe everlasting splendor of the sky

She saw the quivering pinkness of waters curled by the breath of the
morningunder the deepening of the dawnlike a far fluttering and
scattering of roseleaves of fire

Saw the shoreless cloudless marvellous doublecircling azure of
perfect summer daystwin glories of infinite deeps interreflected
while the Soul of the World lay still suffused with a jewellight as
of vaporized sapphire

Saw the Sea shift colorchange sheetswhen the viewless Wizard of
the Wind breathed upon its face and made it green

Saw the immeasurable panicsnoiseless scintillantwhich silver
summer after summer curved leagues of beach with bodies of little
fishthe yearly massacre of migrating populations nations of
seatrout driven from their element by terrorand the winnowing of
sharkfinsand the rushing of porpoisesand the rising of the
grandeecaille like a pillar of flameand the diving and pitching
and fighting of the frigates and the gullsand the armored hordes of
crabs swarming out to clear the slope after the carnage and the gorging
had been done

Saw the Dreams of the Skyscudding mockeries of ridged foamand
shadowy stratification of capes and coasts and promontories longdrawn
outand imageries multicolored of mountain frondage and sierras
whitening above sierrasand phantom islands ringed around with
lagoons of glory

Saw the toppling and smouldering of cloudworlds after the enormous
conflagration of sunsetsincandescence ruining into darkness and
after it a moving and climbing of stars among the blacknesseslike
searching lamps

Saw the deep kindle countless ghostly candles as for mysterious
nightfestivaland a luminous billowing under a black sky and
effervescences of fire and the twirling and crawling of phosphoric
foam

Saw the mesmerism of the Moonsaw the enchanted tides selfheaped in
muttering obeisance before her

Often she heard the Music of the Marsh through the night an infinity
of flutings and tinklings made by tiny amphibialike the low blowing
of numberless little tin horns the clanking of billions of little
bellsand at intervals profound tones vibrant and heavy as of a
bass violthe orchestra of the great frogs And interweaving with it
all one continuous shrillingkeen as the steel speech of a sawthe
stridulous telegraphy of crickets

But alwaysalways dreaming or awake she heard the huge blind Sea
chanting that mystic and eternal hymn which none may hear without awe
which no musician can learn

Heard the hoary PreacherEl Pregonadorpreaching the ancient Word
the word as a fire and as a hammer that breaketh the rock in
piecesthe ElohimWord of the Sea 

Unknowingly she came to know the immemorial sympathy of the mind with
the Soul of the Worldthe melancholy wrought by its moods of gray
the reverie responsive to its vagaries of mist the exhilaration of its
vast exultingsdays of windy joy hours of transfigured light

She felteven without knowing itthe weight of the Silences the
solemnities of sky and sea in these low regions where all things seem
to dreamwaters and grasses with their momentary wavingswoods
graywebbed with mosses that drip and droolhorizons with their
delusions of vaporcranes meditating in their marsheskites
floating in the high blue Even the children were singularly quiet
and their play less noisythough she could not have learned the
differencethan the play of city children Hour after hour the women
sewed or wove in silence And the brown menalways barefooted
always wearing rough blue shirtsseemed when they lounged about the
wharf on idle days as if they had told each other long ago all they
knew or could ever know and had nothing more to say They would stare
at the flickering of the current at the drifting of clouds and
buzzardseldom looking at each other and always turning their black
eyes again in a weary way to sky or sea Even thus one sees the
horses and the cattle of the coast seeking the beach to escape the
whizzing fliesall watch the long waves rolling in and sometimes
turn their heads a moment to look at one another but always look back
to the waves again as if wondering at a mystery

How often she herself had wonderedwondered at the multiform changes
of each swell as it came intransformations of tint of shape of
motion that seemed to betoken a life infinitely more subtle than the
strange cold life of lizards and of fishesand sinister and
spectral Then they all appeared to move in orderaccording to one
law or impulseeach had its own voice yet all sang one and the same
everlasting song Vaguely as she watched them and listened to them
there came to her the idea of a unity of will in their motion a unity
of menace in their utterancethe idea of one monstrous and complex
life The sea lived it could crawl backward and forward it could
speakit only feigned deafness and sightlessness for some malevolent
end Thenceforward she feared to find herself alone with it Was it
not at her that it strove to rush muttering and showing its white
teeth  just because it knew that she was all by herself  Si
quieres aprender a orar entra en el mar And Concha had well learned
to pray But the sea seemed to her the one Power which God could not
make to obey Him as He pleased Saying the creed one day she repeated
very slowly the opening wordsCreo en un Dios padre todopoderoso
Criador de cielo y de la tierraand paused and thought Creator of
Heaven and Earth Madrecita Carmen she askedquien entonces hizo
el mar who then made the sea

Dios mi querida answered CarmenGod my darling All things
were made by Him todas las cosas fueron hechas por El

Even the wicked Sea And He had said unto it Thus far and no
farther  Was that why it had not overtaken and devoured her when
she ran back in fear from the sudden reaching out of its waves Thus
far But there were times when it disobeyedwhen it rushed
further shaking the world Was it because God was then asleepcould
not hear did not see until too late

And the tumultuous ocean terrified her more and more it filled her
sleep with enormous nightmareit came upon her in dreams
mountainshadowingholding her with its spell smothering her power
of outcry heaping itself to the stars

Carmen became alarmedshe feared that the nervous and delicate child
might die in one of those moaning dreams out of which she had to arouse
her night after night But Feliu answering her anxiety with one of
his favorite proverbs suggested a heroic remedy

The world is like the sea those who do not know how to swim in it
are drownedand the sea is like the world he added Chita must
learn to swim

And he found the time to teach her Each morning at sunrise he took
her into the water She was less terrified the first time than Carmen
thought she would beshe seemed to feel confidence in Feliu although
she screamed piteously before her first ducking at his hands His
teaching was not gentle He would carry her out perched upon his
shoulder until the water rose to his own neck and there he would
throw her from him and let her struggle to reach him again as best she
could The first few mornings she had to be pulled out almost at once
but after that Feliu showed her less mercy and helped her only when he
saw she was really in danger He attempted no other instruction until
she had learned that in order to save herself from being half choked by
the salt water she must not scream and by the time she became
habituated to these austere experiences she had already learned by
instinct alone how to keep herself afloat for a while how to paddle a
little with her hands Then he commenced to train her to use themto
lift them well out and throw them forward as if reaching to dip them
as the blade of an oar is dipped at an angle without loud
splashingand he showed her also how to use her feet She learned
rapidly and astonishingly well In less than two months Feliu felt
really proud at the progress made by his tiny pupil it was a delight
to watch her lifting her slender arms above the water in swift easy
curves with the same fine grace that marked all her other natural
motions Later on he taught her not to fear the sea even when it
growled a littlehow to ride a swell how to face a breaker how to
dive She only needed practice thereafter and Carmen who could also
swim finding the childs health improving marvellously under this new
discipline took good care that Chita should practice whenever the
mornings were not too cold or the water too rough

With the first thrill of delight at finding herself able to glide over
the water unassisted the childs superstitious terror of the sea
passed away Even for the adult there are few physical joys keener
than the exultation of the swimmerhow much greater the same glee as
newly felt by an imaginative childa child whose vivid fancy can
lend unutterable value to the most insignificant trifles can transform
a weedpatch to an Eden  Of her own accord she would ask for her
morning bath as soon as she opened her eyesit even required some
severity to prevent her from remaining in the water too long The sea
appeared to her as something that had become tame for her sake
something that loved her in a huge rough way a tremendous playmate
whom she no longer feared to see come bounding and barking to lick her
feet And little by little she also learned the wonderful healing
and caressing power of the monster whose cool embrace at once
dispelled all drowsiness feverishness wearinesseven after the
sultriest nights when the air had seemed to burn and the mosquitoes
had filled the chamber with a sound as of water boiling in many
kettles And on mornings when the sea was in too wicked a humor to be
played with how she felt the loss of her loved sport and prayed for
calm Her delicate constitution changedthe soft pale flesh became
firm and brown the meagre limbs rounded into robust symmetry the thin
cheeks grew peachy with richer life for the strength of the sea had
entered into her the sharp breath of the sea had renewed and
brightened her young blood

 Thou primordial Sea the awfulness of whose antiquity hath stricken
all mythology dumbthou most wrinkled diving Sea the millions of
whose years outnumber even the multitude of thy hoary motionsthou
omniform and most mysterious Sea mother of the monsters and the
godswhence shine eternal youth Still do thy waters hold the
infinite thrill of that Spirit which brooded above their face in the
Beginningstill is thy quickening breath an elixir unto them that
flee to thee for lifelike the breath of young girls like the breath
of children prescribed for the senescent by magicians of
oldprescribed unto weazened elders in the books of the Wizards

 Eighteen hundred and sixtysevenmidsummer in the pestsmitten
city of New Orleans

Heat motionless and ponderous The steelblue of the sky bleached from
the furnacecircle of the horizonthe lukewarm river ran yellow and
noiseless as a torrent of fluid wax Even sounds seemed blunted by the
heaviness of the airthe rumbling of wheels the reverberation of
footsteps fell halftoned upon the ear like sounds that visit a
dozing brain

Daily almost at the same hour the continuous sense of atmospheric
oppression became thickeneda packed herd of lowbellying clouds
lumbered up from the Gulf crowded blackly against the sun flickered
thundered and burst in torrential raintepid perpendicularand
vanished utterly away Then more furiously than before the sun
flamed downroofs and pavements steamed the streets seemed to smoke
the air grew suffocating with vapor and the luminous city filled with
a faint sickly odora stale smell as of dead leaves suddenly
disinterred from wet mouldas of grasses decomposing after a flood
Something saffron speckled the slimy water of the gutters sulphur some
called it others feared even to give it a name Was it only the
windblown pollen of some innocuous plant

I do not know but to many it seemed as if the Invisible Destruction
were scattering visible seed  Such were the days and each day the
terrorstricken city offered up its hecatomb to death and the faces of
all the dead were yellow as flame

DECEDE DECEDEE FALLECIODIED  On the doorposts
the telegraphpoles the pillars of verandas the lampsover the
government letterboxeseverywhere glimmered the white annunciations
of death All the city was spotted with them And lime was poured
into the gutters and huge purifying fires were kindled after sunset

The nights began with a black heatthere were hours when the acrid
air seemed to ferment for stagnation and to burn the bronchial
tubingthen toward morning it would grow chill with venomous
vapors with morbific dewstill the sun came up to lift the torpid
moisture and to fill the buildings with ovenglow And the
interminable procession of mourners and hearses and carriages again
began to circulate between the centres of life and of deathand long
trains and steamships rushed from the port with heavy burden of
fugitives

Wealth might flee yet even in flight there was peril Men who might
have been saved by the craft of experienced nurses at home hurriedly
departed in apparent health unconsciously carrying in their blood the
toxic principle of a malady unfamiliar to physicians of the West and
Northand they died upon their way by the roadside by the
riverbanks in woods in deserted stations on the cots of quarantine
hospitals Wiser those who sought refuge in the purity of the pine
forests or in those near Gulf Islands whence the bright seabreath
kept ever sweeping back the expanding poison into the funereal swamps
into the misty lowlands The wateringresorts became
overcrowdedthen the fishing villages were throngedat least all
which were easy to reach by steamboat or by lugger And at last even
Vioscas Pointremote and unfamiliar as it washad a stranger to
shelter a good old gentleman named Edwards rather broken down in
healthwho came as much for quiet as for seaair and who had been
warmly recommended to Feliu by Captain Harris For some years he had
been troubled by a disease of the heart

Certainly the old invalid could not have found a more suitable place so
far as rest and quiet were concerned The season had early given such
little promise that several men of the Point betook themselves
elsewhere and the aged visitor had two or three vacant cabins from
among which to select a dwellingplace He chose to occupy the most
remote of all which Carmen furnished for him with a cool moss bed and
some necessary furnitureincluding a big wooden rockingchair It
seemed to him very comfortable thus He took his meals with the
family spent most of the day in his own quarters spoke very little
and lived so unobtrusively and inconspicuously that his presence in the
settlement was felt scarcely more than that of some dumb
creaturesome domestic animalsome humble pet whose relation to the
family is only fully comprehended after it has failed to appear for
several days in its accustomed place of patient waitingand we know
that it is dead


IV

Persistently and furiously at halfpast two oclock of an August
morning Sparicio rang Dr La Brierres nightbell He had fifty
dollars in his pocket and a letter to deliver He was to earn another
fifty dollarsdeposited in Felius handsby bringing the Doctor to
Vioscas Point He had risked his life for that moneyand was
terribly in earnest

Julien descended in his underclothing and opened the letter by the
light of the hall lamp It enclosed a check for a larger fee than he
had ever before received and contained an urgent request that he would
at once accompany Sparicio to Vioscas Pointas the sender was in
hourly danger of death The letter penned in a long quavering hand
was signedHenry Edwards

His fathers dear old friend Julien could not refuse to gothough
he feared it was a hopeless case Angina pectorisand a third attack
at seventy years of age Would it even be possible to reach the
sufferers bedside in time Due giornocon ventosaid Sparicio
Still he must go and at once It was Friday morningmight reach
the Point Saturday night with a good wind  He roused his
housekeeper gave all needful instructions prepared his little
medicinechestand long before the first rosegold fire of day had
flashed to the city spires he was sleeping the sleep of exhaustion in
the tiny cabin of a fishingsloop

 For eleven years Julien had devoted himself heart and soul to the
exercise of that profession he had first studied rather as a polite
accomplishment than as a future calling In the unselfish pursuit of
duty he had found the only possible consolation for his irreparable
loss and when the war came to sweep away his wealth he entered the
struggle valorously not to strive against men but to use his science
against death After the passing of that huge shock which left all
the imposing and splendid fabric of Southern feudalism wrecked forever
his profession stood him in good steadhe found himself not only able
to supply those personal wants he cared to satisfy but also to
alleviate the misery of many whom he had known in days of
opulencethe princely misery that never doffed its smiling mask
though living in secret from week to week on bread and orangeleaf
teathe misery that affected condescension in accepting an invitation
to dinestaring at the face of a watch refused by the MontdePiete
with eyes half blinded by starvationthe misery which could afford
but one robe for three marriageable daughtersone plain dress to be
worn in turn by each of them on visiting daysthe pretty
miseryyoung brave sweetasking for a treat of cakes too
jocosely to have its asking answeredlaughing and coquetting with its
wellfed wooers and crying for hunger after they were gone Often and
often his heart had pleaded against his purse for such as these and
won its case in the silent courts of Self But ever mysteriously the
gift camesometimes as if from the hand of a former slave sometimes
as from a remorseful creditor ashamed to write his name Only yellow
Victorine knew but the Doctors housekeeper never opened those
sphinxlips of hers until years after the Doctors name had
disappeared from the City Directory

He had grown quite thina little gray The epidemic had burthened
him with responsibilities too multifarious and ponderous for his
slender strength to bear The continual nervous strain of abnormally
protracted duty the perpetual interruption of sleep had almost
prostrated even his will Now he only hoped that during this brief
absence from the city he might find renewed strength to do his
terrible task

Mosquitoes bit savagely and the heat became thickerand there was
yet no wind Sparicio and his hired boy Carmelo had been walking
backward and forward for hours overheadurging the vessel yard by
yard with long poles through the slime of canals and bayous With
every heavy push the weary boy would sigh outSanto AntonioSanto
Antonio Sullen Sparicio himself at last burst into vociferations of
illhumorSanto AntonioAh santissimu e santu diavulu 
Sacramentu paescite vegnu un asidentemalidittu lu Signuri All
through the morning they walked and pushed trudged and sighed and
swore and the minutes dragged by more wearily than the shuffling of
their feet Managgia Cristo co tutta a croce  Santissimu e
santu diavulu 

But as they reached at last the first of the broad bright lakes the
heat lifted the breeze leaped up the loose sail flapped and filled
and bending graciously as a skater the old San Marco began to shoot
in a straight line over the blue flood Then while the boy sat at the
tiller Sparicio lighted his tiny charcoal furnace below and prepared
a simple mealdelicious yellow macaroni flavored with goats cheese
some fried fish that smelled appetizingly and rich black coffee of
Oriental fragrance and thickness Julien ate a little and lay down to
sleep again This time his rest was undisturbed by the mosquitoes and
when he woke in the cooling evening he felt almost refreshed The
San Marco was flying into Barataria Bay Already the lantern in the
lighthouse tower had begun to glow like a little moon and right on the
rim of the sea a vast and vermilion sun seemed to rest his chin Gray
pelicans came flapping around the mastseabirds sped hurtling by
their white bosoms roseflushed by the western glow  Again
Sparicios little furnace was at workmore fish more macaroni more
black coffee also a squareshouldered bottle of gin made its
appearance Julien ate less sparingly at this second meal and smoked
a long time on deck with Sparicio who suddenly became very
goodhumored and chatted volubly in bad Spanish and in much worse
English Then while the boy took a few hours sleep the Doctor helped
delightedly in maneuvering the little vessel He had been a good
yachtsman in other years and Sparicio declared he would make a good
fisherman By midnight the San Marco began to run with a long
swinging gaitshe had reached deep water Julien slept soundly the
steady rocking of the sloop seemed to soothe his nerves

After all he thought to himself as he rose from his little bunk
next morningsomething like this is just what I needed  The
pleasant scent of hot coffee greeted himCarmelo was handing him the
tin cup containing it down through the hatchway After drinking it he
felt really hungryhe ate more macaroni than he had ever eaten
before Then while Sparicio slept he aided Carmelo and during the
middle of the day he rested again He had not had so much
uninterrupted repose for many a week He fancied he could feel himself
getting strong At suppertime it seemed to him he could not get
enough to eatalthough there was plenty for everybody

All day long there had been exactly the same wavecrease distorting the
white shadow of the San Marcos sail upon the blue waterall day long
they had been skimming over the liquid level of a world so jewelblue
that the low green ribbonstrips of marsh land the faroff fleeing
lines of pineyellow sand beach seemed flaws or breaks in the
perfected color of the universeall day long had the cloudless sky
revealed through all its exquisite transparency that inexpressible
tenderness which no painter and no poet can ever reimagethat
unutterable sweetness which no art of man may ever shadow forth and
which none may ever comprehendthough we feel it to be in some
strange way akin to the luminous and unspeakable charm that makes us
wonder at the eyes of a woman when she loves

Evening came and the great dominant celestial tone deepenedthe
circling horizon filled with ghostly tintsspectral greens and grays
and pearllights and fishcolors  Carmelo as he crouched at the
tiller was singing in a low clear alto some tristful little melody
Over the sea behind them lay blackstretching a long low arm of
islandshorebefore them flamed the splendor of sundeath they were
sailing into a mighty gloryinto a vast and awful light of gold

Shading his vision with his fingers Sparicio pointed to the long lean
limb of land from which they were fleeing and said to La Brierre

Looka Docta Lasta Islan

Julien knew ithe only nodded his head in reply and looked the other
wayinto the glory of God Then wishing to divert the fishermans
attention to another theme he asked what was Carmelo singing
Sparicio at once shouted to the lad

Ha  ho CarmeloSantu diavulu  Singa louda Docta
lika Singa sing  He singa niceeadded the boatman with
his peculiar dark smile And then Carmelo sang loud and clearly the
song he had been singing beforeone of those artless Mediterranean
ballads full of caressing vowelsounds and young passion and
melancholy beauty

 Mama ancor belta fulgente
 Come tu mamasti allor
 Ascoltar non dei gente
 Solo interroga il tuo cor 

He singa niceemucha bueno murmured the fisherman And then
suddenlywith a rich and splendid basso that seemed to thrill every
fibre of the plankingSparicio joined in the song

 Mama pur damore eterno
 Ne deilitto sembri a te
 Tassicuro che linferno
 Una favola sol e 

All the roughness of the man was gone To Juliens startled fancy the
fishers had ceased to belo Carmelo was a princely page Sparicio a
king How perfectly their voices married togetherthey sang with
passion with power with truth with that wondrous natural art which
is the birthright of the rudest Italian soul And the stars throbbed
out in the heaven and the glory died in the west and the night opened
its heart and the splendor of the eternities fell all about them
Still they sang and the San Marco sped on through the soft gloom ever
slightly swerved by the steady blowing of the southeast wind in her
sailalways wearing the same crimplingfrill of wavespray about her
prowalways accompanied by the same smoothbacked swellsalways
spinning out behind her the same long trail of interwoven foam And
Julien looked up Ever the night thrilled more and more with silent
twinklingsmore and more multitudinously lights pointed in the
eternitiesthe Evening Star quivered like a great drop of liquid
white fire ready to fallVega flamed as a pharos lighting the courses
etherealto guide the sailing of the suns and the swarming of fleets
of worlds Then the vast sweetness of that violet night entered into
his bloodfilled him with that awful joy so near akin to sadness
which the sense of the Infinite bringswhen one feels the poetry of
the Most Ancient and Most Excellent of Poets and then is smitten at
once with the contrastthought of the sickliness and selfishness of
Manof the blindness and brutality of cities whereinto the divine
blue light never purely comes and the sanctification of the Silences
never descends  furious cities walled away from heaven  Oh if
one could only sail on thus always always through such a
nightthrough such a starsprinkled violet light and hear Sparicio
and Carmelo sing even though it were the same melody always always
the same song

 Scuza Doctalooka out Julien bent down as the big boom
loosened swung over his head The San Marco was rounding into
shoreheading for her home Sparicio lifted a huge conchshell from
the deck put it to his lips filled his deep lungs and flung out into
the nightthricea profound mellifluent booming horntone A
minute passed Then ghostly faint as an echo from very far away a
triple blowing responded

And a long purple mass loomed and swelled into sight heightened
approachedland and trees blackshadowing and lights that swung 
The San Marco glided into a bayouunder a high wharfing of timbers
where a bearded fisherman waited and a woman Sparicio flung up a
rope

The bearded man caught it by the lanternlight and tethered the San
Marco to her place Then he asked in a deep voice

Has traido al Doctor

Si si answered Sparicio Y el viejo

Aye pobre responded Feliuhace tres dias que esta muerto

Henry Edwards was dead

He had died very suddenly without a cry or a word while resting in
his rockingchairthe very day after Sparicio had sailed They had
made him a grave in the marshamong the high weeds not far from the
ruined tomb of the Spanish fisherman But Sparicio had fairly earned
his hundred dollars


V

So there was nothing to do at Vioscas Point except to rest Feliu and
all his men were going to Barataria in the morning on businessthe
Doctor could accompany them there and take the Grand Island steamer
Monday for New Orleans With this intention Julien retirednot sorry
for being able to stretch himself at full length on the good bed
prepared for him in one of the unoccupied cabins But he woke before
day with a feeling of intense prostration a violent headache and such
an aversion for the mere idea of food that Felius invitation to
breakfast at five oclock gave him an internal qualm Perhaps a touch
of malaria In any case he felt it would be both dangerous and useless
to return to town unwell and Feliu observing his condition himself
advised against the journey Wednesday he would have another
opportunity to leave and in the meanwhile Carmen would take good care
of him  The boats departed and Julien slept again

The sun was high when he rose up and dressed himself feeling no
better He would have liked to walk about the place but felt
nervously afraid of the sun He did not remember having ever felt so
broken down before He pulled a rockingchair to the window tried to
smoke a cigar It commenced to make him feel still sicker and he
flung it away It seemed to him the cabin was swaying as the San
Marco swayed when she first reached the deep water

A light rustling sound approacheda sound of quick feet treading the
grass then a shadow slanted over the threshold In the glow of the
open doorway stood a young girlgracile tallwith singularly
splendid eyesbrown eyes peeping at him from beneath a golden riot of
loose hair

MsieuleDocteur maman dmande si vous navez besoin dqueque
chose  She spoke the rude French of the fishing villages where
the language lives chiefly as a baragouin mingled often with words and
forms belonging to many other tongues She wore a loosefalling dress
of some light stuff steelgray in colorboys shoes were on her feet

He did not replyand her large eyes grew larger for wonder at the
strange fixed gaze of the physician whose face had visibly
bleachedblanched to corpsepallor Silent seconds passed and still
the eyes staredflamed as if the life of the man had centralized and
focussed within them

His voice had risen to a cry in his throat quivered and swelled one
passionate instant and failedas in a dream when one strives to call
and yet can only moan  She Her unforgotten eyes her brows her
lipsthe oval of her facethe dawnlight of her hair  Adeles
own poiseher own graceeven the very turn of her neck even the
birdtone of her speech  Had the grave sent forth a Shadow to haunt
himcould the perfidious Sea have yielded up its dead For one
terrible fraction of a minute memories doubts fears mad fancies
went pulsing through his brain with a rush like the rhythmic throbbing
of an electric streamthen the shock passed the Reason
spokeFoolcount the long years since you first saw her
thuscount the years that have gone since you looked upon her last
And Time has never halted silly heartneither has Death stood still

 Plaitilthe clear voice of the young girl asked She thought
he had made some response she could not distinctly hear

Mastering himself an instant as the heart faltered back to its duty
and the color remounted to his lips he answered her in French

Pardon meI did not hear  you gave me such a start  But even
then another extraordinary fancy flashed through his thoughtand with
the tutoiement of a parent to a child with an irresistible outburst of
such tenderness as almost frightened her he cried Oh merciful
Godhow like her  Tell me darling your name  tell me who
you are Dismoi qui tu es mignonnedismoi ton nom

 Who was it had asked her the same question in another idiom ever
so long ago The man with the black eyes and nose like an eagles
beakthe one who gave her the compass Not this manno

She answered with the timid gravity of surprise

Chita Viosca

He still watched her face and repeated the name slowlyreiterated it
in a tone of wondermentChita VioscaChita Viosca

Cest a dire  she said looking down at her
feetConchaConchita His strange solemnity made her smilethe
smile of shyness that knows not what else to do But it was the smile
of dead Adele

Thanks my child he exclaimed of a suddenin a quick hoarse
changed tone He felt that his emotion would break loose in some wild
way if he looked upon her longer I would like to see your mother
this evening but I now feel too ill to go out I am going to try to
rest a little

Nothing I can bring you she askedsome fresh milk

Nothing now dear if I need anything later I will tell your
mother when she comes

Mamma does not understand French very well

No importa Conchitale hablare en Espanol

Bien entonces she responded with the same exquisite smile
Adios senor 

But as she turned in going his piercing eye discerned a little brown
speck below the pretty lobe of her right earjust in the peachy curve
between neck and cheek His own little Zouzoune had a birthmark like
thathe remembered the faint pink trace left by his fingers above and
below it the day he had slapped her for overturning his ink bottle 
To laimin mointo batte moin

ChitaChita

She did not hear  After all what a mistake he might have made
Were not Natures coincidences more wonderful than fiction Better to
waitto question the mother first and thus make sure

Stillthere were so many coincidences The face the smile the eyes
the voice the whole charmthen that markand the fair hair
Zouzoune had always resembled Adele so strangely That golden hair was
a Scandinavian bequest to the Florane familythe tall daughter of a
Norwegian sea captain had once become the wife of a Florane
Vioscawho ever knew a Viosca with such hair Yet again these
Spanish emigrants sometimes married blonde German girls  Might be a
case of atavism too Who was this Viosca If that was his wifethe
little brown Carmenwhence Chitas sunny hair 

And this was part of that same desolate shore whither the Last Island
dead had been drifted by that tremendous surge On a clear day with a
good glass one might discern from here the long blue streak of that
ghastly coast  Somewherebetween here and there  Merciful God


 But again That bivouacnight before the fight at
Chancellorsville Laroussel had begun to tell him such a singular story
 Chance had brought themthe old enemiestogether made them
dear friends in the face of Death How little he had comprehended the
manwhat a brave true simple soul went up that day to the Lord of
Battles  What was itthat story about the little Creole girl saved
from Last Islandthat story which was never finished  Eh what a
pain

Evidently he had worked too much slept too little A decided case of
nervous prostration He must lie down and try to sleep

These pains in the head and back were becoming unbearable Nothing but
rest could avail him now

He stretched himself under the mosquito curtain It was very still
breathless hot The venomous insects were thickthey filled the room
with a continuous ebullient sound as if invisible kettles were boiling
overhead A sign of storm Still it was strangehe could not
perspire 

Then it seemed to him that Laroussel was bending over himLaroussel in
his cavalry uniform Bon jour camaradenous allons avoir un bien
mauvais temps mon pauvre Julien How bad weatherComment un
mauvais temps  He looked in Laroussels face There was something
so singular in his smile Ah yeshe remembered now it was the
wound  Un vilain temps whispered Laroussel Then he was gone
 Whither

Cheri 

The whisper roused him with a fearful start  Adeles whisper So she
was wont to rouse him sometimes in the old sweet nightsto crave some
little attention for ailing Eulalieto make some little confidence
she had forgotten to utter during the happy evening  No no It was
only the trees The sky was clouding over The wind was rising 
How his heart beat how his temples pulsed Why this was fever Such
pains in the back and head

Still his skin was drydry as parchmentburning He rose up and a
bursting weight of pain at the base of the skull made him reel like a
drunken man He staggered to the little mirror nailed upon the wall
and looked How his eyes glowedand there was blood in his mouth
He felt his pulse spasmodic terribly rapid Could it possibly 
No this must be some pernicious malarial fever The Creole does not
easily fall a prey to the great tropical maladyunless after a long
absence in other climates True he had been four years in the army
But this was 1867  He hesitated a moment thenopening his
medicine chest he measured out and swallowed thirty grains of quinine

Then he lay down again His head pained more and moreit seemed as
if the cervical vertebrae were filled with fluid iron And still his
skin remained dry as if tanned Then the anguish grew so intense as to
force a groan with almost every aspiration  Nauseaand the
stinging bitterness of quinine rising in his throatdizziness and a
brutal wrenching within his stomach Everything began to look
pinkthe light was rosecolored It darkened morekindled with
deepening tint Something kept sparkling and spinning before his
sight like a firework  Then a burst of blood mixed with chemical
bitterness filled his mouth the light became scarlet as claret 
Thisthis was  not malaria

 Carmen knew what it was but the brave little woman was not afraid
of it Many a time before she had met it face to face in Havanese
summers she knew how to wrestle with it she had torn Felius life
away from its yellow clutch after one of those long struggles that
strain even the strength of love Now she feared mostly for Chita
She had ordered the girl under no circumstances to approach the cabin

Julien felt that blankets had been heaped upon himthat some gentle
hand was bathing his scorching face with vinegar and water Vaguely
also there came to him the idea that it was night He saw the
shadowshape of a woman moving against the red light upon the wallhe
saw there was a lamp burning

Then the delirium seized him he moaned sobbed cried like a
childtalked wildly at intervals in French in English in Spanish

Mentirayou could not be her mother  Still if you wereAnd
she must not come in herejamais  Carmen did you know
AdeleAdele Florane So like herso likeGod only knows how
like  Perhaps I think I knowbut I do notdo not know justly
fullyhow like  Si sies el vomitoyo lo conozco Carmen 
She must not die twice  I died twice  I am going to die again
She only once Till the heavens be no more she will not rise  Moi
au contraire il faut que je me leve toujours They need me so
muchthe slate is always full the bell will never stop They will
ring that bell for me when I am dead  So will I rise
againresurgam  How could I save himcould not save myself It
was a bad caseat seventy years  There Qui ca 

He saw Laroussel againreaching out a hand to him through a whirl of
red smoke He tried to grasp it and could not  Nimporte mon
ami said Larousseltu vas la voir bientot Who was he to see
soonqui done Laroussel But Laroussel did not answer Through
the red mist he seemed to smilethen passed

For some hours Carmen had trusted she could save her
patientdesperate as the case appeared to be His was one of those
rapid and violent attacks such as often despatch their victims in a
single day In the Cuban hospitals she had seen many and many terrible
examples strong young mensoldiers fresh from Spaincarried
panting to the fever wards at sunrise carried to the cemeteries at
sunset Even troopers riddled with revolutionary bullets had lingered
longer  Still she had believed she might save Juliens life the
burning forehead once began to bead the burning hands grew moist

But now the wind was moaningthe air had become lighter thinner
cooler A stone was gathering in the east and to the feverstricken
man the change meant death  Impossible to bring the priest of the
Caminada now and there was no other within a days sail She could
only pray she had lost all hope in her own power to save

Still the sick man raved but he talked to himself at longer intervals
and with longer pauses between his wordshis voice was growing more
feeble his speech more incoherent His thought vacillated and
distorted like flame in a wind

Weirdly the past became confounded with the present impressions of
sight and of sound interlinked in fastastic affinitythe face of
Chita Viosca the murmur of the rising storm Then flickers of
spectral lightning passed through his eyes through his brain with
every throb of the burning arteries then utter darkness camea
darkness that surged and moaned as the circumfluence of a shadowed
sea And through and over the moaning pealed one multitudinous human
cry one hideous interblending of shoutings and shriekings  A
womans hand was locked in his own  Tighter he muttered tighter
still darling hold as long as you can It was the tenth night of
August eighteen hundred and fiftysix 

Cheri

Again the mysterious whisper startled him to consciousnessthe dim
knowledge of a room filled with ruby colored lightand the sharp odor
of vinegar The house swung round slowlythe crimson flame of the
lamp lengthened and broadened by turnsthen everything turned dizzily
fastwhirled as if spinning in a vortex  Nausea unutterable and a
frightful anguish as of teeth devouring him withintearing more and
more furiously at his breast Then one atrocious wrenching rending
burningand the gush of blood burst from lips and nostrils in a
smothering deluge Again the vision of lightnings the swaying and
the darkness of long ago Quickquickhold fast to the table
Adelenever let go 

 Upupupwhat higher yet Up to the red sky Redblackred
 heated iron when its vermilion dies So too the frightful flood
And noiseless Noiseless because heavy clammythick warm
sickeningblood Well might the land quake for the weight of such a
tideWhy did Adele speak Spanish Who prayed for him 

Alma de Cristo santisima santificame

Sangre de Cristo embriagame

O buen Jesus oye me 

Out of the darkness intosuch a light An azure haze Ahthe
delicious frost  All the streets were filled with the sweet blue
mist  Voiceless the City and whitecrooked and weed grown its
narrow ways  Old streets of tombs these  Eh How odd a

only by nightcalled up from the darkness and silence  Yet
shemight he not dare to ring for her even by day  Strange
he had deemed it daywhy it was black starless  And it was
growing queerly cold  How should he ever find her now It was
so black  so cold 

Cheri

All the dwelling quivered with the mighty whisper

Outside the great oaks were trembling to their rootsall the shore
shook and blanched before the calling of the sea

And Carmen kneeling at the feet of the dead cried out alone in the
night
