THE RISE OF ROSCOE PAINE

By Joseph C Lincoln




CHAPTER I


Im going up to the village I told Dorinda taking my cap from the
hook behind the diningroom door

What for asked Dorinda pushing me to one side and reaching for the
dustcloth which also was behind the door

Oh just for the walk I answered carelessly

Umhm observed Dorinda

Umhm is I believe good Scotch for Yes I have read that it
is somewherein one of Barries yarns I think I had never been in
Scotland or much of anywhere else except the city I was born in and
my college town and Bostonand Cape Cod Umhm meant yes on the
Cape too except when Dorinda said it then it might mean almost
anything When Mother asked her to lower the window shade in the
bedroom she said Umhm and lowered it And five minutes later when
Lute came in loaded to the guards with explanations as to why he had
forgotten to clean the fish for dinner she said it again And the
Equator and the North Pole are no nearer alike so far as temperature
is concerned than those two Umhms And between them she had others
expressing all degrees from frigid to semitorrid

Her Umhm this time was somewhere along the northern edge of Labrador

Its a good morning for a walk I said

Umhm repeated Dorinda crossing over to Greenland so to speak

I opened the outside door The warm spring sunshine pouring in was a
pleasant contrast and made me forget for the moment the glacier at my
back Come to think of it glacier isnt a good word glaciers move
slowly and that wasnt Dorindas way

What are you going to do I asked

Work snapped Dorinda unfurling the dust cloth Its a good mornin
for that too

I went out turned the corner of the house and found Lute sound asleep
on the wash bench behind the kitchen His full name was Luther Millard
Filmore Rogers and he was Dorindas husband by law and the burden
which Providence or hard luck had ordered her to carry through this
vale of tears She was a good Methodist and there was no doubt in
her mind that Providence was responsible When she rose to testify in
prayermeeting she always mentioned her cross and everybody knew that
the cross was Luther She carried him but it is no more than fair to
say that she didnt provide him with cushions She never let him forget
that he was a steerage passenger However Lute was well upholstered
with philosophy of a kind and so long as he didnt have to work his
passage was happy even if the voyage was a rather rough one

Just now he was supposed to be raking the back yard but the rake was
between his knees his head was tipped back against the shingled wall
of the kitchen and he was sleeping with the sunshine illuminating his
open mouth for all the world like a lamp in a potato cellar as his
wife had said the last time she caught him in this position She went on
to say that it was a pity he wouldnt stand on his head when he slept
Then I could see if your skull was as holler as I believe it is she
told him

Lute heard me as I passed him and woke up The potato cellar closed
with a snap and he seized the rake handles with both hands

I was takin a sort of observation he explained hurriedly Figgerin
whether Id better begin here or over by the barn Oh its you Roscoe
is it Land sakes I thought first twas Dorindy Where you bound

Up to the village I said

Aint goin to the postoffice be you

I may I dont know

Lute sighed I was kind of callatin to go there myself he observed
regretfully Thoph Newcomb and Capn Jed Dean and the rest of us
was havin a talk on politics last night up there and twas mighty
interestin Old Dean had Thoph pretty well out of the race when I
hauled alongside but when I got into the argument twas different
Whats goin to become of the laborin men of this country if you have
free trade I says Dean had to give in that he didnt know Might
have to let their wives support em he says pompous as ever That
would be a calamity wouldnt it Lute That wasnt no answer of
course But you cant expect sense of a Democrat I left him fumin and
come away Ive thought of a lot more questions to ask him since and
I was hopin I could get at him this mornin But no Dorindys sot on
havin this yard raked so I spose Ive got to do it

He had dropped the rake but now he leaned over picked it up and rose
from the wash bench

I spose Ive got to do it he repeated unless hopefully you
want me to run up to the village and do your errand for you

No I hadnt any errand

Well then I spose Id better start in Unless there was somethin
else youd ruther Id do today If there was I could do this
tomorrer

Tomorrow would have one advantage there would be more to rake then
However judging by Dorindas temper this morning I think perhaps you
had better do it today

Whats Dorindy doin

She is dusting the diningroom

Ill bet you And she dusted it yesterday and the day afore Do you
know Lute sat down again on the benchsometimes I get real worried
about her

No Do you

Yes I do I think she works too hard Seemss if sometimes it had kind
of struck to her brainswork I mean She dont think of nothin else
Now take the dustin for instance Dustins all right I believe in
dustin things But I dont believe in wearin em out dustin em That
aint sense is it

It doesnt seem like it thats a fact

You bet it dont And it aint good religion neither Now takewell
take this yard for instance What is it that Im slavin myself over
this fine mornin Why rakin this yard And what am I rakin Why
dead leaves from last fall and straws and sticks and pieces of seaweed
and such that have blowed in durin the winter And what blowed em in
Why the wind sartin And whose wind was it The Almightys thats
whose Now then if the Almighty didnt intend to have dead leaves
around why did he put trees for em to fall off of If he didnt want
straws and seaweed and truck around why did He send them everlastin
notheasters last November Did that idea ever strike you

I dont know that it ever did exactly in that way

No Well thats cause you aint reasoned it out same as I have
Youve got the same trouble that most folks have you dont reason
things out Now lets look at it straight in the face Lute let go of
the rake altogether and used both hands to illustrate his point That
finger there well say is me rakin and rakin hard as ever I can
And that fist there is the Almighty not meanin anything irreverent
I rake same as Im doin this mornin The yards all cleaned up
Thenzing Lutes clenched fist swept across and knocked the
offending finger out of the way Zing here comes one of the Almightys
notheasters same as were likely to have tomorrer and the consarned
yard is just as dirty as ever Aint that so

I looked at the yard It seems to be about as it was I agreed with
some sarcasm Lute was an immune so far as sarcasm was concerned

Yup he said triumphantly Now Dorindy shes a good pious woman
She believes the Powers above order everything If thats so then aint
it sacrilegious to be all the time flyin in the face of them Powers by
rakin and rakin and dustin and dustin Thats the question

But according to that reasoning I observed we should neither rake
nor dust Wouldnt that make our surroundings rather uncomfortable
after a while

Sartin But when they got uncomfortable then we could turn to and make
em comfortable again I aint arguin against workneedful work you
understand I like it And I aint thinkin of myself you know but
about Dorindy It worries me to see her wearin herself out withwith
dustin and such It aint sense and taint good religion Shes my
wife and its my duty to think for her and look out for her

He paused and reached into his overalls pocket for a pipe Finding it
he reached into another pocket for the wherewithal to fill it

Have you suggested to her that shes flying in the face of Providence
I asked

Lute shook his head No he admitted I aint Got any tobacco about
you Dorindy hove my plug away yesterday I left it back of the clock
and she found it and was maddustin again of course

He took the pouch I handed him filled his pipe and absently put the
pouch in his pocket

Got a match he asked Thanks No I aint spoke to her about it
though its been on my mind for a long spell I didnt know but you
might say somethin to her along that line Roscoe Twouldnt sound so
personal comin from you What do you think

I shook my head Dorinda wouldnt pay much attention to my ideas on
such subjects Im afraid I answered She knows Im not a regular
churchgoer

Lute was plainly disappointed Well he said with a sigh maybe
youre right She does callate youre kind of heathen though she hopes
youll see the light some day But just the same he added its a
good argument I tried it on the gang up to the postoffice last night
I says to em says I Works all right I believe in it Im a workin
man myself But to work when you dont have to is wrong Take Ros
Paine I says

Why should you take me I interrupted rather sharply

Cause youre the best example I could think of Everybody knows you
dont do no work Shootin and sailin and fishin aint work and
thats about all you do Take Ros says I He might be to work He
was in a bank up to the city once and he knows the bankin trade He
might be at it now but what would be the use I says Hes got enough
to live on and he lives on it stead of keepin some poor feller out of
a job Thats right too aint it

I didnt answer at once There was no reason why I should be irritated
because Luther Rogers had held me up as a shining example of the
donothing class to the crowd of hangerson in a country postoffice
What did I care for Denboro opinion Six years in that gossipy village
had made me so I thought capable of rising above such things

Well I asked after a moment what did they say to that

Oh nothin much They couldnt I had em you see Some of em
laughed and old Capn Jed he hove out somethin about birds of a feather
stickin up for each other No sense to it But as I said afore what
can you expect of a Democrat

I turned on my heel and moved toward the back gate Aint goin be
you asked Lute Hadnt you better set down and rest your breakfast a
spell

No Im going By the way if youre through with that tobacco pouch of
mine Ill take it off your hands I may want to smoke by and by

Lute coolly explained that he had forgotten the pouch it had gone
clean out of his head However he handed it over and I left him seated
on the wash bench with his head tipped back against the shingles I
opened the gate and strolled slowly along the path by the edge of the
bluff I had gone perhaps a hundred yards when I heard a shrill voice
behind me Turning I saw Dorinda standing by the corner of the kitchen
dust cloth in hand Her husband was raking for dear life

I walked on The morning was a beautiful one Beside the path on the
landward side the bayberry and beachplum bushes were in bud the green
of the new grass was showing above the dead brown of the old a bluebird
was swaying on the stump of a wild cherry tree and the pines and scrub
oaks of the grove by the Shore Lane were bright vivid splashes of color
against the blue of the sky At my right hand the yellow sand of the
bluff broke sharply down to the white beach and the waters of the
bay now beginning to ebb Across the bay the lighthouse at Crow Point
glistened with new paint and I could see a moving black speck which I
knew was Ben Small the keeper busy whitewashing the fence beside
it Down on the beach Zeb Kendrick was overhauling his dory In the
distance beyond the grove I could hear the carpenters hammers on the
roof of the big Atwater mansion which was now the property of James
Colton the New York millionaire whose rumored coming to Denboro to
live had filled the columns of the country weekly for three months The
quahaug boats were anchored just inside the Point a clam digger was
wading along the outer edge of the sedge a lobsterman was hauling his
pots in the channel even the bluebird on the wild cherry stump had
a straw in his beak and was plainly in the midst of nest building
Everyone had something to do and was doing iteveryone except Lute
Rogers and myself the birds of a feather And even Lute was working
now under compulsion

Ordinarily the sight of all this industry would not have affected me I
had seen it all before or something like it The six years I had spent
in Denboro the six everlasting idle monotonous years had had their
effect I had grown hardened and had come to accept my fate at first
rebelliously then with more of Lutes peculiar kind of philosophy
Circumstances had doomed me to be a goodfornothing a gentleman loafer
without the usual excusemoneyand as it was my doom I forced myself
to accept it if not with pleasure at least with resignation And I
determined to get whatever pleasure there might be in it So when I saw
the majority of the human race each with a purpose in life struggling
to attain that purpose I passed them by with my gun or fishing rod
on my shoulder and a smile on my lips If my remnant of a conscience
presumed to rise and reprove me I stamped it down It had no reasonable
excuse for rising I wasnt what I was from choice

But somehow on this particular morning my unreasonable conscience was
again alive and kicking Perhaps it was the quickening influence of the
spring which resurrected it perhaps Luthers quotation from the remarks
of Captain Jedediah Dean had stirred it to rebellion A man may know in
his heart that he is no good and still resent having others say that he
is particularly when they say that he and Luther Rogers are birds of a
feather I didnt care for Deans good opinion of course I didnt Nor
for that of any one else in Denboro my mother excepted But Dean and
the rest should keep their opinions to themselves confound them

The path from our housethe latter every Denboro native spoke of as
the Paine Placewound along the edge of the bluff for perhaps three
hundred yards then turned sharply through the grove of scrub oaks and
pitch pines and emerged on the Shore Lane The Shore Lane was not a
public road in the strictest sense of the term It was really a part of
my land and leading as it did from the Lower Road to the beach was
used as a public road merely because mother and I permitted it to be It
had been so used by sufferance of the former owner for years and when
we came into possession of the property we did not interfere with the
custom Land along the shore was worth precious little at that time and
besides it was pleasant rather than disagreeable to hear the fish
carts going out to the weirs and the wagons coming to the beach for
seaweed or filled with picnic parties rattling down the Lane We
could not see them from the house until they had passed the grove and
emerged upon the beach but even the noise of them was welcome The
Paine Place was a good halfmile from the Lower Road and there were few
neighbors therefore especially in the winter months any sounds of
society were comforting

I strode through the grove kicking the dead branches out of my way for
my mind was still busy with Luther and Captain Dean As I came out into
the Lane I looked across at the Atwater mansion now the property of the
great and only Colton Big Jim Colton whose deals and corners in Wall
Street supplied so many and such varied sensations for the financial
pages of the city papers just as those of his wife and family supplied
news for the society columns I looked across I say and then I stopped
short to take a longer look

I could see the carpenters whose hammers I had heard at work upon the
roof of the barn now destined to do double duty as a stable and garage
They and the painters and plumbers had been busy on the premises for
months The establishment had been a big one even when Major Atwater
owned it but the new owners had torn down and added and rebuilt until
the house loomed up like a palace or a Newport villa A Newport villa
in Denboro Why on earth any one should deliberately choose Denboro as a
place to live in I couldnt understand but why a millionaire with
all creation to select from should build a Newport villa on the bluff
overlooking Denboro Bay was beyond comprehension The reason given in
the Cape Cod Item was that Mrs Colton was in debilitated health
whatever that is and had been commanded by her doctors to seek sea air
and seclusion and rest Well there was sea air and rest not to mention
seclusion or sand and mosquitoes for a square mile about the new villa
and no one knew that better than I condemned to live within the
square But if Mrs Colton had deliberately chosen the spot with malice
aforethought the place for her was a home for the feeble minded At
least that was my opinion on that particular morning

It was not the carpenters who caused me to pause in my walk and look
across the lane and over the stone wall at my new neighbors residence
What caught my attention was that the place looked to be inhabited The
windows were openfifty or so of themsmoke was issuing from one of
the six chimneys a maid in a white cap and apron was standing by the
servants entrance Yes and a tall bulky man with a yachting cap
on the back of his head and a cigar in his mouth was talking with Asa
Peters the boss carpenter by the big door of the barn

I had not been up to the village for two days having been employed at
our boathouse on the beach below the house getting my motor dory
into commission for the summer But now I remembered that Lute had said
something about the Coltons being expected or having arrived and that
he seemed much excited over it He would have said more but Dorinda had
pounced on him and sent him out to shut up the chickens which gave
him the excuse to play truant and take his evenings trip to the
postoffice It was plain that the Coltons HAD arrived Very likely the
stout man with the yachting cap was the mighty Big Jim himself Well
I didnt envy him in his present situation He had my pity if anything

Possibly the fact that I could pity some one other than myself helped
to raise my spirits At any rate I managed to shake off a little of my
gloom and tramped on up the Lane feeling more like a human being and
less like a yellow dog Less as I should imagine a yellow dog ought
to feel I mean for as a matter of fact most yellow dogs of my
acquaintance seem to be as happy as their brown or white or black
relatives I walked up the Lane turned into the Lower Road and headed
for the village The day was a gorgeous one the air bracing as a tonic
and my thirtieth birthday was not yet so far astern as to be lost in
the fog After all there were some consolations in being alive and in a
state of health not debilitated I began to whistle

A quarter of a mile from the junction of the Shore Lane on the Lower
Road was a willowshaded spot where the brook which irrigated Elnathan
Mullets cranberry swamp ran under a small wooden bridge It was there
that I first heard the horn and turning saw the automobile coming from
behind me It was approaching at a speed of I should say thirty miles
an hour and I jumped to the rail of the bridge to let it pass Autos
were not as common on the Cape then as they have become since Now the
average pedestrian of commonsense jumps first and looks afterwards

However I jumped in time and stood still to watch the car as it went
by But it did not go bynot then Its speed slackened as it
approached and it came to a halt on the bridge beside me A big car
an aristocratic car a machine of pomp and price and polish such as
Denboro saw but seldom It contained three personsa capped and goggled
chauffeur on the front seat and a young fellow and a girl in the
tonneau They attracted my attention in just that orderfirst the
chauffeur then the young fellow and last of all the girl

It was the chauffeur who hailed me He leaned across the upholstery
beside him and still holding the wheel said

Say Bill whats the quickest way to get to Bayport

Now my name doesnt happen to be Bill and just then I objected to the
rechristening At another time I might have appreciated the joke and
given him the information without comment But this morning I didnt
feel like joking My dissatisfaction with the world in general included
automobilists who made common folks get out of their way and I was
resentful

I should say that you had picked about as quick a way as any I
answered

The chauffeur didnt seem to grasp the true inwardness of this brilliant
bit

Aw what he stammered Say whatlook here I asked you

Then the young man in the tonneau took charge of the conversation He
was a very young man with blond hair and a silky mustache and his
clothes fitted him as clothes have no right to fiton Cape Cod

Thatll do Oscar he ordered Then turning to me he said

See here my man we want to go to Bayport

I was not his man and wouldnt have been for something The chauffeur
had irritated me but he irritated me more I didnt like him his
looks his clothes and particularly his manner Therefore because
I didnt feel like answering I showed my independence by remaining
silent

Whats the matter he demanded impatiently Are you deaf I say we
want to go to Bayport

A newspaper joke which I had recently read came to my mind Very well
I said you have my permission

It was a rude thing to say and not even original I dont attempt to
excuse it In fact I was sorry as soon as I had said it It had its
effect The young man turned red Then he laughed aloud

Well by Jove he exclaimed What have we here A humorist I do
believe Mabel weve discovered a genuine rural humorist Another
David Harum by Jove Look at him

The girl in the tonneau swept aside her veil and looked as directed
And I looked at her The face that I saw was sweet and refined and
delicate a beautiful young face the face of a lady born and bred All
this I saw and realized at a glance but what I was most conscious of at
the time was the look in the dark eyes as they surveyed me from head
to foot Indifference was there and contemptuous amusement she
didnt even condescend to smile much less speak Under that look my
selfimportance shrank until the yellow dog with which I had compared
myself loomed as large as an elephant She might have looked that way at
some curious and rather ridiculous bug just before calling a servant to
step on it

The young man laughed again Isnt it a wonder Mabel he asked The
native wit on his native heath Reubenpardon me your name is Reuben
isnt itnow that youve had your little joke would you condescend to
tell us the road which we should take to reach Bayport in the shortest
time Would you oblige us to that extent

The young lady smiled at this Victor she said how idiotic you
are

I agreed with her Idiot was one of the terms the mildest which I
should have applied to that young man I wanted very much to remove him
from that car by what Lute would call the scruff of the neck But most
of all just then I wanted to be alone to see the last of the auto and
its occupants

First turn to the right second to the left I said sullenly

Thank you Reuben vouchsafed the young man Heres hoping that your
vegetables are fresher than your jokes Go ahead Oscar

The chauffeur threw in the clutch and the car buzzed up the road
turning the corner at full speed There was a loose board projecting
from the bridge just under my feet As a memberthough an inactive
oneof the Village Improvement Society I should have trodden it back
into place I didnt I kicked it into the brook

Then I walked on But the remainder of my march was a silent one
without music I did not whistle



CHAPTER II


The postoffice was at Eldredges store and Eldredges store situated
at the corners where the Main Road and the Depot Roadwhich is also
the direct road to South Denborojoin was the mercantile and social
center of Denboro Simeon Eldredge kept the store and Simeon was also
postmaster as well as the town constable undertaker and auctioneer
If you wanted a spool of thread a coffin or the latest bit of gossip
you applied at Eldredges The gossip you could be morally certain of
getting at once the thread or the coffin you might have to wait for

I scarcely know why I went to Eldredges that morning I did not
expect mail and I did not require Simeons services in any one of his
professional capacities Possibly Lutes suggestion had some sort of
psychic effect and I stopped at the postoffice involuntarily At any
rate I woke from the trance in which the encounter with the automobile
had left me to find myself walking in at the door

The mail was not yet due to say nothing of having arrived or been
sorted but there was a fairsized crowd on the settees and perched on
the edge of the counter Ezra Mullet was there and Alonzo Black and
Alvin Baker and Thoph Newcomb Beriah Doane and Sam Cahoon who lived
in South Denboro were there too having driven over behind Beriahs
horse on an errand that is Beriah had an errand and Sam came along to
help him remember it In the rear of the store by the frame of letter
boxes Captain Jedediah Dean was talking with Simeon

Alvin Baker saw me first and hailed me as I entered

Heres Ros Paine he exclaimed Hell know more about it than anybody
else Hey Ros how many hired help does he keep anyhow Thoph says
its eight but I know I counted moren that myself

Its eight I tell you broke in Newcomb before I could answer
Theres the two cooks and the boy that waits on em

The idea of having anybody wait on a cook interrupted Mullet Thats
blame foolishness

I never said he waited on the cooks I said he waited on themon the
family And theres a coachman

Why do they call them kind of fellers coachmen put in Thoph There
aint any coach I see the carriages when they cometwo freight cars
full of em There was a open twoseater and a buckboard and that
highwheeled thing they called a dogcart

Beriah Doane laughed uproariously Land of love he shouted Does the
dog have a cart all to himself Thats a good one You and me aint got
no dog Sam but we might have a couple of catcarts hey Haw haw

Thoph paid no attention to this pleasantry There was the dogcart he
repeated and another thing they called the trap But there want any
coach Ill swear to it

Dont make no difference declared Alvin there was a man along that
SAID he was the coachman anyhow And a big ministerlookin feller
who was a butler and two hired girls besides the cooks Thats nine
anyhow One moren you said Thoph

And that dont count the chauffeur the chap that runs the
automobiles said Alonzo Black Hes the tenth Say Ros turning to
me how many is there altogether

How many what I asked It was my first opportunity to speak

Why hired helpservants you know How many does Mr Colton keep

I dont know how many he keeps I said Why should I

The group looked at me in amazement Thoph Newcomb voiced the general
astonishment

Why should you he repeated Why shouldnt you you mean Youre
livin right next door to em as you might say My soul If I was you I
callate Id know afore this time

No doubt you would Thoph But I dont I didnt know the Coltons had
arrived until I came by just now They have arrived I take it

Arrived There was no question of the arrival nor of its being
witnessed by everyone present myself and the South Denboro delegates
excepted Newcomb and Baker and Mullet and Black began talking all
together I learned that the Colton invasion of Denboro was a spectacle
only equaled by the yearly coming of the circus to Hyannis or the
opening of the cattle show at Ostable The carriages and horses had
arrived by freight the morning before the servants and the family on
the afternoon train

I see em myself affirmed Alonzo I was as nigh to em as I be to
you Mrs Colton is sort of fleshy but as handsome a woman as youd
want to see I spoke to her too Its a nice day I says aint
it

What did she say asked Newcomb

She didnt say nothin Engine was makin such a noise she didnt hear
I presume likely

Humph sniffed Baker evidently envious I guess she heard you all
right Fellers like you make me tired Grabbin every chance to curry
favor with rich folks Wonder you didnt tell her you drove a fishcart
and wanted her trade As for me Im independent Dont make no
difference to me how welloff a person is Theyre human just the same
as I am and _I_ dont toady to em If they want to talk they can send
for me Ill wait till they do

Hope youve got lots of patience Alvin observed Mullet drily
During the hilarity which followed and while the offended apostle of
independence was trying to think of a sufficiently cutting reply I
walked to the rear of the store

Our letter box was Number 218 in the center of the rack and as I
approached I glanced at it involuntarily To my surprise there was a
letter in it I could see it through the glass of the box door Lute
had as I knew got the mail the previous evening and the mornings mail
had not yet arrived Therefore this letter must have been written by
some one in Denboro and posted late the night before or early that
morning It was not the custom for Denboro residents to communicate with
each other through the medium of the post They preferred to save the
two cents stamp money as a general thing Bills sometimes came by mail
but this was the tenth not the first of the month and besides our
bills were paid

I reached into my pocket for my keys unlocked the box and took out the
letter The envelope was square of an expensive quality and eminently
aristocratic It was postmarked Denboro dated that morning and
addressed in a sharp clear masculine hand unfamiliar to me to Roscoe
Paine Esq The Esq would have settled it if the handwriting had
not No fellowtownsman of my acquaintance would address me or any
one else as Esquire Misters and Captains were common enough but
Esquiresno

It was a Denboro custom when one received a mysterious letter to get
the fullest enjoyment out of the mystery before solving it I had known
Dorinda Rogers to guess surmise and speculate for ten minutes before
opening a patent medicine circular But though mysteries were uncommon
enough in my life I think I should have reached the solution of
this one in the next secondin fact I had torn the end from the
envelopewhen I was interrupted

It was Captain Dean who interrupted me He had evidently concluded his
conversation with the postmaster and now was bearing down majestically
upon me like a ten thousand ton steamer on a porgie schooner

Hey youRos he roared He was at my elbow but he roared just the
same Skipper of a coaster in his early days he had never outgrown the
habit of pitching his voice to carry above a fiftymile gale Hey Ros
See here I want to talk to you

I did not want to talk with any one particularly with him He was the
individual who according to Lute had bracketed Mr Rogers and myself
as birds of a feather the remark which was primarily responsible for my
ill humor of the morning If he had not said that and if Lute had not
quoted the saying to me I might have behaved less like a fool when that
automobile overtook me I might not have given that young idiot whose
Christian name it seemed was Victor the opportunity to be smart at my
expense That girl with the dark eyes might not have looked at me as if
I were a worm or a June bug Confound her what right had she to look at
me like that Victor or whatever his name was was a cub and a cad and
as fresh as the new paint on Ben Smalls lighthouse but he had deigned
to speak Whereas that girl

No I did not want to talk with Jedediah Dean However he wanted to
talk to me and what he wanted he usually got

Captain Dean was one of Denboros leading citizens His parents had been
as poor as Jobs turkey but Jedediah had determined to get money and
now he had it He was reputed to be worth upwards of thirty thousand
owned acres and acres of cranberry swamps and the new house he had just
built was almost as big as it was ugly which is saying considerable He
had wanted to be a deacon in the church and though the church was by no
means so eager deacon he became He was an uncompromising Democrat but
he had forced himself into the Board of Selectmen every other member
a Republican He was director in the Denboro bank and it was town talk
that his most ardent desire at the present time was to see his daughter
HelenNellie we all called hermarried to George Taylor cashier of
that bank As George and Nellie were keeping company it seemed likely
that Captain Jed would be gratified in this as in all other desires
He was a born boss and did his best to run the town according to his
ideas Captain Elisha Warren who lived over in South Denboro and was
also a director in the bank covered the situation when he said Jed
Dean is one of those fellers who ought to have a big family to order
around The Almighty gave him only one child and so he adopted Denboro
and is bossin that

I want to talk to you Ros repeated Captain Jed Come here

He led the way to the settee by the calico and dress goods counter I
put the unread letter in my pocket and followed him

Set down he ordered Come to anchor alongside

I came to anchor

Hows your mother he asked Matilda was callatin to go down and
set with her a spell this afternoon if she didnt have anything else to
doif Matilda didnt I mean

Matilda was his wife In her husbands company she was as dumb as a
broken phonograph when he was not with her she talked continuously
as if to get even A call from Matilda Dean was one of the additional
trials which made Mothers invalid state harder to bear

Course she may not come Jedediah hastened to say Shes pretty busy
these days But if she dont have anything else to do she will I told
her shed better

Mother will be charmed I said Captain Jed was no fool and he looked
at me sharply

Um yes he grunted I presume likely Youre charmed too aint
you

I was not expecting this I murmured something to the effect that I was
delighted of course

Sartin Well thats all right I didnt get you on this settee to
charm you I want to talk business with you a minute

Business With me

Yup Or it may be business later on Ive been thinkin about that
Shore Lane the one that runs through your land Us town folks use that
a whole lot I callate most everybodys come to look at it as a reglar
public road to the beach

Why yes I suppose they have I said puzzled to know what he was
driving at It is a public road practically

No taint neither Its a private way and if you wanted to you
could shut it off any day A good many folks would have shut it off
afore this

Oh I guess not

I guess yes Id shut it off myself I wouldnt have Tom Dick and
Harry drivin fish wagons and tip carts full of seaweed through my
premises free gratis for nothin

Why I asked What harm does it do

I dont know as it does any But because a tramp sleepin on my front
piazza might not harm the piazza thats no reason why Id let him sleep
there

I laughed The two cases arent exactly alike are they I said The
land is of no value to us at present Mother and I are glad to have the
Lane used if it is a convenience as I suppose it is

Its that sartin Ros who owns that land the Lane runs throughyou
or your mother

It is in my name I said

Umhm Well would you sell it

Sell it Sell that strip of sand and beach grass Who would buy it

I dont know as anybody would I just asked if youd sell it thats
all

Perhaps I would I presume I should if I had the chance

Aint had any chance yet have you

What do you mean by that

Oh nothin nothin Well you just think it over If you decide you
would sell it and get so fur as fixin a price on it let me know will
you

Captain what in the world do you want of that land See here you
dont want to shut off the Shore Lane do you

What in time would I want to shut it off for I use it as much as
anybody dont I

Then I dont see

Maybe there aint nothin TO see Only if you decide to sell let me
know Yes and dont sell WITHOUT lettin me know Understand

No I dont

Well you understand enough I callate All I want you to do is to
promise not to sell that land the Lanes on without speakin to me fust
Will you promise that

I considered for a moment Yes I said Ill promise that Though I
cant imagine what youre driving at

You dont need to Maybe Im just drivin blind I hope I am Thats
all I wanted to talk about rising from the settee Oh by the way
he added your neighborhoods honored just now aint it The King of
New Yorks arrived they tell me

King of New York Oh I see you mean the Coltons

Sartin Who else Met his Majesty yet

No Have you

I met him when he was down a month ago Sim Eldredge introduced me
right here in the store Mr Colton says Sim proud but humble so
to speak let me make you acquainted with one of our selectmen Capn
Dean Capn shake hands with Mr Colton of New York We shook and I
callate Id ought to have kept that hand in a glass case ever since
But somehow or other I aint

What sort of a chap is Colton I asked

Oh all right of his kind I guess In amongst a gang of high financers
like himself hed size up as a pretty good sport I shouldnt wonder
And he was polite enough to me I suppose But darn him I didnt like
the way he looked at me He looked as ifas ifwell I cant tell you
how he looked

You dont need to I said brusquely I know

You do hey He aint looked at you has he No course he aint You
said you hadnt met him

Ive met others of his kind

Yes Well Im a hayseed and I know it Im just a countryman and hes
a millionaire Hell be the big show in this town from now on When he
blows his nose seveneighths of this community ll start in workin up a
cold in the head

He turned on his heel and started to go

Will you I asked slily

He looked back over his shoulder I aint subject to coldsmuch he
snapped But YOU better lay in a supply of handkerchiefs Ros

I smiled I knew what was troubling him A little tin god has a pleasant
time of it no doubt until the coming of the eighteen carat gold idol
Captain Jed had been boss of Denboroselfappointed to that eminent
position but holding it neverthelessand to be pushed from his
perch by a city rival was disagreeable If I knew him he would not be
dethroned without a fight There were likely to be some interesting and
lively times in our village

I could understand Deans dislike of Colton but his interest in the
Shore Lane was a mystery Why should he wish to buy that worthless strip
of land And what did he mean by asking if I had chances to sell it
Still pondering over this puzzle I walked toward the front of the
store past the group waiting for the mail where the discussion
concerning the Coltons was still going on Thoph Newcomb and Alvin Baker
both talking at once

You ask Ros shouted Alvin pounding the counter beside him Say
Ros Newcomb here seems to think that because a feller comes from the
city and is rich that that gives him the right to order the rest of us
around as if we was fomast hands He says

I dont neither yelled Thoph What I say is that money counts
and

You do too Ros do YOU intend to get down on your knees to them
Coltons

I laughed and went on without replying I left the store and strolled
across the road to the bank intending to make a short call on George
Taylor the cashier my most intimate acquaintance and the one person in
Denboro who came nearest to being my friend

But George was busy in the directors room and after waiting a few
moments in conversation with Henry Small the bookkeeper I gave it up
and walked home across the fields this time I had no desire to meet
more automobilists

Dorinda had finished dusting the dining room and was busy upstairs
I could hear the swishswish of her broom overhead I opened the door
leading to Mothers bedroom and entered closing the door behind me

The curtains were drawn as they always were on sunny days and the room
was in deep shadow Mother had been asleep I think but she heard my
step and recognized it

Is that you Boy she asked If I had been fifty instead of
thirtyone Mother would have called me Boy just the same

Yes Mother I said

Where have you been For a walk It is a beautiful morning isnt it

Her only way of knowing that the morning was a beautiful one was that
the shades were drawn She had not seen the sunlight on the bay nor the
blue sky she had not felt the spring breeze on her face or the green
grass beneath her feet Her only glimpses of the outside world were
those which she got on cloudy or stormy days when the shades were raised
a few inches and turning her head on the pillow she could see beneath
them For six years she had been helpless and bedridden in that little
room But she never complained

I told her that I had been uptown for a walk

Did you meet any one she asked

I said that I had met Captain Dean and Newcomb and the rest I said
nothing of my encounter with the motor car

Captain Jed graciously informed me that his wife might be down to sit
with you this afternoon I said Provided she didnt have anything
else to do he took pains to add that You mustnt see her of course

She smiled Why not she asked Matilda is a little tiresome at
times but she means well

Humph Mother I think you would make excuses for the Old Harry
himself That woman will talk you to death

Oh no Not as bad as that And poor Matilda doesnt talk much at home
Im afraid

Her husband sees to that I dont blame him By the way the Captain
had a queer bee in his bonnet this morning He seems to be thinking of
buying some of our property

I told her of Jedediahs interest in the Shore Lane and his hint
concerning its possible purchase She listened and then said
thoughtfully

What have you decided to do about it Roscoe

I havent decided at all What do you think Mother

It seems to me that I shouldnt sell at least until I knew his reason
for wanting to buy It would be different if we needed the money but
of course we dont

Of course I said hastily But why not sell We dont use the land

No But the Denboro people need that Lane They use it a great deal
If it were closed it would put many of them to a great inconvenience
particularly those who get their living alongshore Every one in Denboro
has been so kind to us I feel that we owe them a debt we never can
repay

No one could help being kind to you Mother Oh I have another
piece of news Did you know that our new neighbors the Coltons have
arrived

Yes Dorinda told me Have you met any of them

No

Dorinda says Mrs Colton is an invalid Poor woman it must be hard
to be ill when one has so much to enjoy Dorinda says they have a very
pretty daughter

I made no comment I was not interested in pretty daughters just then
The memory of the girl in the auto was too fresh in my mind

Did you go to the postoffice Roscoe asked Mother I suppose there
were no letters There seldom are

Then I remembered the letter in my pocket I had forgotten it
altogether

Why yes there was a letter a letter for me I havent read it yet

I took the envelope from my pocket and drew out the enclosure The
latter was a note very brief and very much to the point I read it

Well by George I exclaimed angrily

What is it Roscoe

It appears to be a summons from what Captain Jed called the King of New
York A summons to appear at court

At court

Oh not the criminal court Merely the palace of his Majesty Just
listen

This was the letter


Roscoe Paine Esq

Dear Sir

I should like to see you at my house thisThursdayforenoon on a
matter of business I shall expect you at any time after ten in the
morning

Yours truly

JAMES W COLTON


From Mr Colton exclaimed Mother Why what can he want of you

I dont know I answered And I dont particularly care

Roscoe

Mother did you ever hear such a cool nervy proposition in your life
He wants to see me and he orders me to come to him Why doesnt he come
to me

I suppose he didnt think of it He is a big man in New York and he has
been accustomed to having people come at his convenience Its his way
of doing things I suppose

Then I dont like the way This is Denboro not New York He will
expect me at any time after ten will he Well as Mullet said to Alvin
Baker just now at the postoffice I hope he has lots of patience Hell
need it

But what can he want of you

I dont know Wants to look over his nearest jay neighbor I should
imagine and see what sort of a curio he is He thinks it may be
necessary to put up barbed wire fences I suppose

Roscoe dont be narrowminded Mr Coltons ways arent ours and we
must make allowances

Let him make a few for a change

Arent you going to see him

No At least not until I get good and ready

Dorinda came in just then to ask Mother some questions concerning
dinner for though Mother had not seen the dining room since that day
six years ago when she was carried from it to her bedroom she kept
her interest in household affairs and insisted on being consulted on all
questions of management and internal economy I rose from my chair and
started toward the door

Are you going Roscoe asked Mother

Yes

Where

Oh just out of doors perhaps to the boathouse

Boy

Yes Mother

What is the matter Something has gone wrong I knew it as soon as you
came in What is it

Nothing That is nothing of any consequence Im a little out of sorts
today and that mans letter irritates me Ill get over it Ill be
back soon Goodby Mother

Goodby Boy

I went out through the dining room and kitchen to the back yard where
seating myself on Lutes favorite resting place the wash bench I lit
my pipe and sat thinking gloomily thinking



CHAPTER III


It is a dreadful thing to hate ones own father to hate him and be
unable to forgive him even though he is dead although he paid for his
sin with his life Death is said to pay all debts but there are some
it cannot pay To my father I owed my present ambitionless idle
goodfornothing life my mothers illness years of disgrace the loss
of a nameeverything

Paine was my mothers maiden name she was christened Comfort Paine My
own Christian name is Roscoe and my middle name is Paine My other name
the name I was born with the name that Mother took when she married
we dropped when the disgrace came upon us It was honored and respected
once now when it was repeated people coupled it with shame and crime
and dishonor and broken trust

As a boy I remember myself as a spoiled youngster who took the luxuries
of this world for granted I attended an expensive and select private
school idled my way through that somehow and entered college a
happygolucky young fellow with money in my pocket For twothirds
of my Freshman yearwhich was all I experienced of University lifeI
enjoyed myself as much as possible and studied as little Then came the
telegram I remember the looks of the messenger who brought it the cap
he wore and the grin on his young Irish face when the fellow sitting
next me at the battered black oak table in the back room of Kellys
asked him to have a beer I remember the song we were singing the crowd
of us how it began again and then stopped short when the others saw the
look on my face The telegram contained but four words Come home at
once It was signed with the name of my fathers lawyer

I presume I shall never forget even the smallest incident of that night
journey in the train and the homecoming The lawyers meeting me at the
station in the early morning his taking care that I should not see the
newspapers and his breaking the news to me Not of the illness or death
which I had feared and dreaded but of something worsedisgrace My
father was an embezzler a thief He had absconded had run away like
the coward he was taking with him what was left of his stealings The
banking house of which he had been the head was insolvent The police
were on his track And worse and most disgraceful of all he had not
fled alone There was a woman with him a woman whose escapades had
furnished the papers with sensations for years

I had never been well acquainted with my father We had never been
friends and companions like other fathers and sons I knew I remember
him as a harsh redfaced man whom as a boy I avoided as much as
possible As I grew older I never went to him for advice he was to me a
sort of walking pocketbook and not much else Mother has often told
me that she remembers him as something quite different and I suppose it
must be true otherwise she would not have married him but to me he was
a source of supply coupled with a bad temper that was all That I was
not utterly impossible that going my own gait as I did I was not a
complete young blackguard I know now was due entirely to Mother She
and I were as close friends as I would permit her to be Father had
neglected us for years though how much he had neglected and illtreated
her I did not know until she told me afterward She was in delicate
health even then but when the blow fell it was she and not I who bore
up bravely and it was her pluck and nerve not mine which pulled us
through that dreadful time

And it was dreadful The stories and pictures in the papers The
rumors always contradicted that the embezzler had been caught The
misrepresentation and lies and scandal The loss of those whom we had
supposed were friends Mother bore them all wore a calm brave face
in public and only when alone with me gave way and then but at rare
intervals She clung to me as her only comfort and hope I was sullen
and wrathful and resentful an unlicked cub I suspect whose complaints
were selfish ones concerning the giving up of my college life and its
pleasures and the sacrifice of social position and wealth

Mother hador so we thought at the timea sum in her own name which
would enable us to live although not as we had lived by a great deal
We took an apartment in an unfashionable quarter of the city and thanks
to the lawyerwho proved himself a real and true friendI was given
a minor position in a small bank Oddly enough considering my former
life I liked the work it interested me and during the next few years
I was made by successive promotions bookkeeper teller and at last
assistant cashier No news came from the absconder The police had lost
track of him and it seemed probable that he would never be heard of
again But over Mother and myself hung always the dread that he might
be found and all the dreadful business revived once more Mother never
mentioned it nor did I but the dread was there

Then came the first breakdown in Mothers health which necessitated her
removal to the country Luther and Dorinda Rogers were distant relatives
of our friend the lawyer They owned the little house by the shore at
Denboro and the lawyer had visited them occasionally on shooting and
fishing trips They were in need of money for as Dorinda said Weve
got two mouths in this family and only one pair of hands One of the
mouths is so big that the hands cant fill it let alone the mouth that
belongs to THEM Motheras Mrs Paine a widowwent there first as
a boarder intending to remain but a few months Dorinda took to her at
once being attracted in the beginning I think by the name They call
you Comfort Paine she said and you are a comfort to everybody elses
pain Yet you aint out of pain a minute scurcely yourself I never see
anything like it If twant wicked Id say that name was give you by
the Old Scratch himself as a sort of divilish joke But anybody can see
that the Old Scratch never had anything in common with you even a hand
in the christenin

Dorinda was very kind and Lute was a neverending joy in his peculiar
way Mother would have been almost happy in the little Denboro home
if I had been with her But she was never really happy when we were
separated a condition of mind which grew more acute as her health
declined I came down from the city once every month and those Sundays
were great occasions The Denboro people know me as Roscoe Paine

For a time Mother seemed to be holding her own In answer to my
questions she always declared that she was ever so much better But
Doctor Quimby the town physician looked serious

She must be kept absolutely quiet he said She must not be troubled
in any way Worry or mental distress is what I fear most Any sudden bad
news or shock mightwell goodness knows what effect it might have She
must not be worried Ros after one has visited Denboro five times in
succession he is generally called by his Christian nameRos if youve
got any worries you keep em to yourself

I had worries plenty of them Our little fortune saved as we thought
from the wreck suffered a severe shrinkage A considerable portion
of it as the lawyers discovered was involved and belonged to the
creditors I said nothing to Mother about this she supposed that we
had a sufficient income for our needs even without my salary Without
telling her I gave up our city apartment stored our furniture and took
a room in a boardinghouse I was learning the banking business was
trusted with more and more responsibility and believed my future was
secure Then came the final blow

I saw the news in the paper when I went out to lunch Embezzler and His
Companion Caught in Rio Janeiro He Commits Suicide When Notified of
His Arrest These headlines stared at me as I opened the paper at the
restaurant table My father had shot himself when the police came I
read it with scarcely more than a vague feeling of pity for him It was
of Mother that I thought The news must be kept from her If she should
hear of it What should I do I went first of all to the lawyers
office he was out of town for the day I wandered up and down the
streets for an hour Then I went back to the bank There I found a
telegram from Doctor Quimby Mrs Paine very ill Come on first train
I knew what it meant Mother had heard the news the shock which the
doctor dreaded had had its effect

I reached Denboro the next morning Lute met me at the station From his
disjointed and lengthy story I gathered that Mother had been feelin
fustrate for her until the noon before I come back from the
postoffice said Lute and I was callatin to read the newspaper
but Dorindy had some everlastin chore or other for me to doI believe
she thinks em up in her sleepand I left the paper on the dininroom
table and went out to the barn Dorindy she come along to boss me as
usual When we went back to the house there was Mrs Comfort on the
dininroom floordead we was afraid at fust The paper was alongside
of her so we judge she was just agoin to read it when she was took
The doctor says its a paralysis or appleplexy or somethin We carried
her into the bedroom but she aint spoke sence

She did not speak for weeks and when she did it was to ask for me
She called my name over and over again and if I left her even for a
moment she grew so much worse that the doctor forbade my going back to
the city I obtained a leave of absence from the bank for three months
By that time she was herself so far as her reason was concerned but
very weak and unable to bear the least hint of disturbance or worry She
must not be moved so Doctor Quimby said and he held out no immediate
hope of her recovering the use of her limbs She will be confined to
her bed for a long time said the doctor and she is easy only when
you are here If you should go away I am afraid she might die I did
not go away I gave up my position in the bank and remained in Denboro

At the end of the year I bought the Rogers house and land moved a
portion of our furniture down there sold the rest and resigned myself
to a period of idleness in the country Dorinda I hired as housekeeper
and when Dorinda accepted the engagement she threw in Lute so to speak
for good measure

And here I have been ever since At first I looked upon my stay in
Denboro as a sort of enforced vacation which was to be of course only
temporary But time went on and Mothers condition continued unchanged
She needed me and I could not leave her I fished and shot and sailed
and loafed losing ambition and selfrespect aware that the majority of
the village people considered me too lazy to earn a living and
caring little for their opinion At first I had kept up a hit or miss
correspondence with one or two of my associates in the bank but after
a while I dropped even this connection with the world I was ashamed
to have my former acquaintances know what I had become and they
apparently were quite willing to forget me I expected to live and die
in Denboro and I faced the prospect with indifference

The summer people cottagers and boarders I avoided altogether and my
only friend and I did not consider him that was George Taylor the
Denboro bank cashier He was fond of saltwater and outdoor sports and
we occasionally enjoyed them together

Thanks to the lawyer our names had been scarcely mentioned in the
papers at the time of my fathers death No one in the village knew our
identity or our story And because I knew that Mother would worry if
she were told I kept from her the fact that our little income was but
half of what it had been Our wants were few and if my clothes were no
longer made by the best tailors if they were readymade and outofdate
and lacked pressing they were whole at all events because Dorinda was
a tiptop mender In fact I had forgotten they were outofdate until
the sight of the immaculately garbed young chap in the automobile
brought the comparison between us to my mind

But now as I sat on the washbench thinking of all this I looked down
at my baggy trousers and faded waistcoat with disgust One of the surest
signs of the loss of selfrespect is a disregard of ones personal
appearance I looked like a hayseednot the independent countryman who
wears old clothes on week days from choice and is proudly conscious of
a Sunday suit in the closetbut that other variety the postoffice and
billiardroom idler who has reached the point of utter indifference is
too shiftless to care Captain Jed was not so far wrong after allLute
Rogers and I were birds of a feather in more ways than one

No wonder that girl in the auto had looked at me as if I were something
too contemptible for notice Yet I hated her for that look I had
behaved like a boor of course Because I was a failure a country
loafer with no prospect of ever being anything else because I could
not ride in automobiles and others couldthese were no good reasons
for insulting strangers more fortunate than I Yet I did hate that girl
Just then I hated all creation especially that portion of it which
amounted to anything

I took the letter from my pocket and read it again I should like
to see you    on a matter of business What business could Yours
truly James W Colton have with me And Captain Jed also had talked
business I supposed that I had given up business long ago and for good
now all at once it seemed to be hunting me Well all the hunting
should be on its side

At another time I might have treated the great Coltons summons to
court as a joke I might like Mother have regarded the curtness
of the command and its general tone of taking my prompt obedience for
granted as an expression of the Wall Street magnates habit of mind
and nothing more He was used to having people jump when he snapped his
fingers But now it made me angry I sympathized with Dean and Alvin
Baker The possession of money did not necessarily imply omnipotence
This was Cape Cod not New York His Majesty might as Captain Jed put
it have blown his Imperial nose but I for one wouldnt lay in a
supply of handkerchiefsnot yet

I heard a rustle in the bushes and turning my head saw Lute coming
along the path He was walking fastfast for him that isand seemed
to be excited His excitement however did not cause him to forget
prudence He looked carefully about to be sure his wife was not in
sight before he spoke

Dorindy aint been here sence Ive been gone has she was his first
question

I guess not said I She has been in the house since I got back But
I dont know how long youve been gone

Only a few minutes II just stepped over cross the Lane for a jiffy
thats all Say by time them Coltons must have money

Thats a habit of millionaires I believe

Hey What do you mean by that If they didnt have money they couldnt
be millionaires could they Howd you like to be a millionaire Ros

I dont know I never tried

By time ID like to try a spell Ive been over lookin round their
place You never see such a place Why their front doorsteps big as
this yard pretty nigh

Does it have to be raked I asked

Raked Whoever heard of rakin a doorstep

Give it up But it does seem to me that I have heard of raking a yard
I think Dorinda mentioned that didnt she

Lute looked at me then he hurried over and picked up the rake which
was lying near the barn a pilea very small pileof chips and leaves
beside it

When did she mention it he asked

A week ago I think was the first time She has referred to it
occasionally since She was mentioning it to you when I went up town
this morning I heard her

Lute looked relieved Oh THEN he said I thought you meant lately
Well Im rakin it aint I Say Ros he added eagerly did you
go to the postoffice when you was uptown Was there a letter there for
you

What makes you think there was

Asa Peters boy the bowlegged one told me The chauffeur the feller
that pilots the automobiles asked him where the postoffice was and he
see the address on the envelope He said the letter was for you I told
him he was lyin

What in the world did you tell him that for I interrupted I had
known Lute a long time but he sometimes surprised me even yet

Cause he is nine times out of ten replied Lute promptly You
never see such a youngone for dodgin the truth Why one time he told
his grandmother Asas ma I mean that

What did he say about the letter

Said twas for you And the chauffeur said Mr Colton told him to mail
it right off Twant for you was it Ros

Yes

It WAS Well by time What did a man like Mr Colton write to you
about

Among his other lackings Lute was conspicuously short of tact This was
no time for him to ask me such a question especially to emphasize the
you

Why shouldnt he write to me I asked tartly

Butbut HIMwritin to YOU

Humph Even a god stoops once in a while Read your mythology Lute

Hey Say look here what are you swearin about

Swearing Oh thats all right The god I referred to was a heathen
one

Well its a good thing Dorindy didnt hear you shes down on
swearin heathen or any other kind But what did Mr Colton write to
you for

He says he wants to see me

See you What for

Dont know Perhaps he wants to borrow money

Borrow I believe youre crazy

No Im tolerably sane There there dont look at me like that
Heres his letter Read it if you want to

Lutes fingers were so eager to grasp that letter that they were all
thumbs He dropped it on the grass picked it up with as much care as if
it was a diamond and holding it a foot from his nosehe had broken
his spectacles and was afraid to ask Dorinda for the money to have them
repairedhe spelt it out to the last word

Well by time he exclaimed when he had finished He wants to see
you at his house this forenoon Andandwhy the forenoons all but
gone now What are you settin here for

Well I thought I should enjoy watching you rake the yard It is a
pleasure deferred so far

Watchin me Roscoe Paine you are out of your head Aint you goin
to see him

No

You AINT

No

Ros Paine have you jined in with them darn fools uptown

Whos swearing now What fools do you mean

Darn aint swearin Dorindy herself says that once in a while I mean
Alvin Baker and Jed Dean and the rest of em They was goin on about
Mr Colton last night said THEY want goin to run at his beck and
call I told em says I You aint had the chance Youll run fast
enough when you do

Did you say that to Captain Jed

Noo I said it to Alvin but old Jeds just as bad Hes down on
anybody thats got moren he has But Ros you aint foolish enough to
side with Jed Dean Just think Heres Mr Colton richern King Solomon
and all his glory Hes got servants and butlers and bonds and cowpons
and horses and teams and automobiles and

I rose from the wash bench

I know what hes got Lute I interrupted And I know what he hasnt
got

What Is there anything he aint got

He hasnt got menot yet If he wants to see me he may I expect to be
at home for the next day or two

You dont mean you expect a millionaire like him to come cruisin after
YOU Well by time I think I see him

When you do let me know I said I should like to be prepared

Wellbytime said Lute by way of summing up I ate dinner with
Dorinda Her husband did not join us Dorinda paid a visit to the back
yard and seeing how little raking had been done announced that until
the job was finished there would be no dinner for some folks So she
and I ate and Lute raked under protest and vowing that he was so faint
and holler he callated to collapse most any time

After the meal was finished I went down to the boathouse The boathouse
was a little building on the beach at the foot of the bluff below the
house It was a favorite resort of mine and I spent many hours there
My eighteen foot motor launch the Comfort the one expensive luxury I
allowed myself and which I had bought secondhand two years before
was jacked up in the middle of the floor The engine which I had taken
apart to clean was in pieces beside it On the walls hung my two shot
guns and my fishing rod Outside on the beach was my flatbottomed
skiff which I used for rowing about the bay her oars under the
thwarts In the boathouse was a comfortable armchair and a small shelf
of books novels for the most part A cheap clock and a brokendown
couch the latter a discard from the original outfit of the cottage
made up the list of furniture

My idea in coming to the boathouse was to continue my work with the
engine I tried it for a half hour or so and then gave it up It did not
interest me then I shut the door at the side of the building that by
which I had enteredthe big double doors in front I had not opened at
alland taking a book from the shelf stretched myself on the couch to
read

The book I had chosen was one belonging to the Denboro Ladies Library
Miss Almena Doane the librarian had recommended it highly as a real
interesting story with lots of uplifting thoughts in it The thoughts
might be uplifting to Almena but they did not elevate my spirits As
for the storywell the hero was a young gentleman who was poor but
tremendously clever and handsome and the heroine had eyes as dark and
deep as starlit pools The poor but beautiful person met the pooleyed
one at a concert where he sat his whole soul transfigured by the
music and she had been fascinated in spite of herself by the look on
his face I read as far as that and dropped the book in disgust

After that I must have fallen asleep What awakened me was a knock
on the door It was Lute of course Probably mother wanted me for
something or other and Dorinda had sent her husband to hunt me up

The knock was repeated

Come in I said sleepily

The door opened and in came not Lute but a tall portly man with a
yachting cap on the back of his gray head and a cigar in his mouth He
looked at me as I lay on the couch and I lay on the couch and looked at
him

Afternoon he said curtly Is your name Paine

I nodded I was waking rapidly but I was too astonished to speak

Roscoe Paine

Yes

Well mines Colton I sent you a letter this morning Did you get it



CHAPTER IV


I sat up on the couch Mr Colton knocked the ashes from his cigar
waited an instant and then repeated his question

Did you get my letter he asked

Yes I said

Oh you did I was afraid that man of mine might have forgotten to mail
it

No I got it Wont youerwont you sit down He pulled the
armchair toward him and sat down I noticed that he had a habit of doing
things quickly His sentences were short and to the point and he spoke
and acted like one accustomed to having his own way He crossed his
knees and looked about the little building

It is a pleasant day I observed for the sake of saying something
He did not seem to hear me or if he did he was not interested in the
weather For my part I found the situation embarrassing I knew what his
next question would be and I did not know how to answer Sure enough
he asked it

I wrote you to come over to my place this forenoon he said You
didnt come

No I

Why not

Here was the issue joined Here if ever was the opportunity to assert
my independence a la Jed Dean and Alvin Baker But to assert it now
after he had done the unexpected after the mountain had come to
Mahomet seemed caddish and ridiculous So I temporized weakly

I didnt read your letter until about noon I said

I see Well I waited until two oclock and then I decided to hunt you
up I called at your house The woman there said you were down here
Your mother

No My answer was prompt and sharp enough this time It was natural
perhaps that he should presume Dorinda to be my mother but I did not
like it

He paid absolutely no attention to the tone of my reply or its curtness
He did not refer to Dorinda again She might have been my wife or my
greataunt for all he cared

This your workshop he asked abruptly Then nodding toward the
dismembered engine What are you a boat builder

No not exactly

Whats the price of a boat like that indicating the Comfort with a
kick in her direction

About two hundred and fifty dollars I believe I answered

You believe Dont you know

No I bought that boat secondhand

He did not refer to the boat again apparently forgot it altogether His
next move was to rise and turn toward the door I watched him wondering
what was going to happen next He had a habit of jumping from one
subject to another which was bewildering

Whats that fellow doing off there he asked suddenly

I looked where he was pointing

That is Zeb Kendrick I answered Hes raking for quahaugs

Raking for what hogs

Quahaugs What you New Yorkers call clams

Oh Sell em does he

Yes

Tell him to call at my house next time you see him And for heavens
sake tell him to come to the servants door Dont you people down here
have any servants doors to your houses There have been no less than
fifty peddlers on my porch since yesterday and my butler will die of
apoplexy if it keeps on Hes a good one for a wonder and I dont want
to lose him

I made no reply to this observation and he did not seem to expect any
He watched Zeb rake for a moment and then he turned back to me

Can you come over to my house now he asked

I was not expecting this and again I did not have an answer ready

Can you he went on Ive got a business deal to make with you and
Id rather make it there Ive got a lot of carpenters and painters
at work and they ask me ten questions a minute They are unnecessary
questions but if I dont answer them the fellows are sure to make some
fool mistake or other They need a governess If youll come over with
me Ill be in touch with them and you and I can talk just as well Can
come cant you

I did not know what to say I wanted to say no that if he had any
business with me it could be discussed in that boathouse I did not like
his manner yet I had a feeling that it was his usual one and that he
had not meant to be rude And I could think of no good reason for not
going with him

You can come cant you he repeated

I suppose I can But

Of course if youre too busy to leave

I remembered the position he had found me in and I rather think I had
turned red He did not smile but there was a sort of grim twinkle in
his eyes

Ill come I said

Much obliged I wont keep you long Come on

He led the way and I followed rebellious and angry not so much with
him as with myself I wished now that I had gone over to the Colton
place when I first received the summons to court instead of making
proclamations of defiance to mother and Lute Rogers This seemed such
a complete backdown As we passed the house I saw Lute peering from the
barn I devoutly hoped he might not see me but he did His mouth opened
and he stared Then catching my eye he winked triumphantly I wanted
to punch his head

The King of New York walked briskly on in silence until we were just at
the edge of the grove by the Shore Lane Then he stopped and turned to
me

You own all this land dont you he asked

Yes

Humph Get a good view from here

I admitted that the view was good At that particular point it embraced
nearly the whole of the bay in front and a large portion of the village
at the side

He waved his hand toward the cluster of houses

There are eighteen hundred people in this town they tell me he said
Permanent residents I mean What do they all do

Do

Yes How do they get a living They must get it somehow In the regular
summer resorts they squeeze it out of the city people I know that But
there arent so many cottagers and boarders here What do you all do for
a living

I told him that most of masculine Denboro fished or farmed or kept
store

Which do you do he asked You said you werent a boatbuilder

Im not doing anything at present I replied shortly

Out of a job

You might call it that Is this a part of the business you wished to
see me about Mr Colton

I was boiling inwardly and a little of the heat was expressed in my
tone I dont know whether he took the hint or merely lost interest in
the subject At any rate his reply was a brief No and we continued
our walk

As we reached the Shore Lane he paused again and I thought he was about
to speak He did not however and we crossed the boundary line of my
property and entered the Colton grounds As we drew nearer to the house
I was surprised to see how large it was When the Atwaters owned it
I was an occasional caller there for old Major Atwater was fond of
shooting and sometimes borrowed my decoys But since it changed hands
I had not been nearer to it than the Lane With the new wing and the
other additions it was enormous It fairly reeked of money though so
far as I was a judge the taste shown in rebuilding and decorating was
good We turned the corner where Asa Peters the head carpenter came
hurrying up Asa looked surprised enough to see me in company with his
employer and regarded me wonderingly Mr Colton he said I wanted
to ask you about them skylights I stepped back out of hearing but I
inferred from Coltons actions that the question was another one of the
unnecessary ones he had so scornfully referred to in the boathouse

Jackass he exclaimed as he rejoined me I judged he was classifying
Asa but if so he did not trouble to lower his voice Come on
Paine he added and we passed a long line of windows hung with costly
curtains and stepped up on a handsome Colonial portico before two big
doors

The doors were opened by an imposing personage in dark blue and brass
buttons who bowed profoundly before Colton and regarded me with
condescending superiority This personage whom I recognized from
Alvins description as the ministerlookin butler led us through
a hall about as large as our sittingroom diningroom and kitchen
combined but bearing no other resemblance to these apartments and
opened another door through which bowing once more he ushered us
Then he closed the door leaving himself to my relief outside It had
been a long time since I was waited upon by a butler and I found this
specimen rather overpowering

The room we were in was the library and though it was bigger and far
more sumptuous than the library I remembered so well as a boy the sight
of the books in their cases along the walls gave me a feeling almost of
homesickness My resentment against my millionaire neighbor increased
Why should he and his have everything and the rest of us be deprived of
the little we once had

Colton seated himself in a leather upholstered chair and waved his hand
toward another

Sit down he said He took a cigar from his pocket Smoke he asked

I was a confirmed smoker but I was not going to smoke one of his
cigarsnot then

No thank you said I He did not comment on my refusal but lit the
cigar himself from the stump of his former one Then he crossed his
legs and proceeded with characteristic abruptness to his subject

Paine he began you own this land next to me you say Your property
ends at the fence this side of that road we just crossed doesnt it

It ends where yours begins I announced

Yes Just this side of that road

Of the Shore Lane It isnt a road exactly

I dont care what you call it Road or lane or cowpath It ends
there

Yes

And it IS your land It belongs to you personally all of it free and
clear

Whyyes it does I could not see what business of his my ownership
of that land might be

All right I asked that because if it wasnt yours if it was tied up
or mortgaged in any way it might complicate matters But it isnt

No

Good Then we can get down to brass tacks and save time I want a piece
of that land

I looked at him

You want I repeated slowly

I want a strip of your land Want to buy it of course I dont expect
you to give it to me Whats it worth by the acre say

I did not answer All at once I was beginning to see a light Captain
Jed Deans mysterious conversation at the postoffice was beginning to
lose some of its mystery

Well asked Colton impatiently Then without waiting longer he
added

By the way before you name a figure answer me one more question That
roador lane or whatever it isthat is yours too Doesnt belong to
the town

The light was growing more brilliant I could see breakers ahead

No I replied slowly It is a private way It belongs to me

Good Well whats that land of yours worth by the acre

I shook my head I scarcely know I said Ive never figured it that
way

I dont care how you figure it Here lets get down to a business
proposition I want to buy a strip of that land from the Lower
Roadthats what you call the one above here isnt itto the beach
The strip I want is about three hundred feet wide for a guess It
extends from my fence to the other side of that grove by the bluff What
will you sell it for

The breakers were close aboard However I dodged them momentarily

Why do you want to buy I asked

For reasons

I should think you had land enough already

I thought I had but it seems I havent Well whats your price for
that strip

Mr Colton IIm afraid

Never mind that I suppose youre afraid youll make the price too low
Now see here Im a busy man I havent time to do any bargaining
Name your price and if its anywhere within reason we wont haggle
I expect to pay more than anyone else would Thats part of my fine
for being a city man and not a native Gad the privilege is worth the
money Ill pay the fine Whats the price

But why do you want to buy

For reasons of my own I tell you They havent anything to do with
your selling

Im not so sure

What do you mean by that

That strip takes in the Shore Lane Mr Colton

I know it

And if you buy I presume the Lane will be closed

He looked at me surprised and I thought a little annoyed

Well he said suppose it is

But it will be wont it

You bet your life it will What of it

Then I dont know that I care to sell

He leaned back in his chair

You dont care to sell he repeated slowly What the devil do you
mean by that

What I said And besides Mr Colton I

He interrupted me

Why dont you care to sell he demanded The land is no good to you
is it

Not much No

Humph Are you so rich that youve got all the money you want

I was angry all through I rose from my chair

Good day Mr Colton I said

Here he shouted Hold on Where are you going

I cant see that there is any use of our talking further

No use WhyThere there sit down Its none of my business how rich
you are and I beg your pardon Sit down Sit down man I tell you

I sat down reluctantly He threw his cigar which had gone out into
the fireplace and lit another

Say he said you surprise me Paine What do you mean by saying you
wont sell that land You dont know what Ill pay for it yet

No I dont

Then how do you know you wont sell it I never had anything
yetexcept my wife and familythat I wouldnt sell for a price Look
here I havent got time to do any DownEast horsejockeying Ill make
you an offer Ill give you five hundred dollars cash for that strip of
land What do you say

I didnt say anything Five hundred dollars was a generous offer I
couldnt help thinking what Mother and I might do with that five hundred
dollars

What do you say he repeated

I answered Yankee fashion with another question Mr Colton I
asked why do you want to close that Shore Lane

Because I do What difference does it make to you why I want to close
it

That Lane has been used by Denboro people for years It is almost a
public necessity

He puffed twice on his cigar before he spoke again When he did it was
in a different tone

I see he said Humph I see Paine does the town pay you rent for
the use of that road

No

Has it been bidding to buy it

No

Is any one else after it

Noo I think not But

You THINK not That means youre not sure Youve had a bite somewhere
Somebody has been nibbling at your hook Well theyve got to bite quick
and swallow some to get ahead of me I want that road closed and Im
going to have it closed sooner or later Id prefer it sooner

But why do you want to close it

Before he could answer there came a knock at the door The butler
appeared

I beg your pardon sir he began His master cut him short

Tell em to wait he ordered I cant see any one now Johnson If it
is that damned carpenter he can wait

It isnt the carpenter sir explained Johnson Its Mrs Colton
sir She wishes to know if you have bought that road She says three of
those orrid fishcarts have gone by in the last hour sir and they are
making her very nervous Thats all sir

Tell her Ive bought it snapped the head of the house Get out

The butler obeyed orders Colton turned to me

You heard that Paine he said Thats my reason the principal one
I bought this place principally on account of Mrs Coltons health The
doctors said she needed quiet and rest I thought she could have them
hereGod knows the place looked forsaken enoughbut it appears she
cant Whenever she or I sit on the veranda or at a window we have to
watch a procession of jays driving smelly fish carts through that lane
of yours or be stared at by a gang of countrymen hanging over the
fence Its a nuisance It is bad enough for me or my daughter and our
guests but it will be the ruination of my wifes nerves and I cant
stand for that You see the position Im in You heard what I told that
butler I said I had bought the road You wouldnt make me a liar would
you Ill give you five hundred for that bunch of sand You couldnt get
more for it if you sold it by the pound like tea Say yes and close
the deal

I shook my head

I understand your position Mr Colton I said but I cant say yes
Not now at any rate

Why not Isnt five hundred enough

Its a good offer

Then why not accept it

Because if I were certain that I wanted to sell I could not accept
any offer just now

Why not See here are you afraid the town will be sore because the
road is closed

It would be a great inconvenience to them

Its a greater one to me as it is Can you afford to be a
philanthropist Are you one of those publicspirited citizens we read
about

He was sneering now and my anger which had lessened somewhat when he
spoke of his wifes ill health was rising again

Are you he repeated

I dont know as to that But as I said a while ago Mr Colton I
couldnt sell that land to you now

Why not

Because if there were no other reason I promised not to sell it
without telling another person first

He threw down his cigar and stood up I rose also

I see he said with sarcasm I knew there was something beside
public spirit You think by hanging off and playing me against this
other sucker you can get a higher price Well if thats the game Ill
keep him busy

He took out his watch glanced at it and thrust it back into his
pocket

Ive wasted time enough over this fool thing he declared Now that I
know what the game is well talk to the point Its highway robbery but
I might have expected to be robbed Ill give you six hundred for that
land

I did not answer I was holding my temper by main strength and I could
not trust myself to speak

Well he sneered That shakes your public spirit some hey What do
you say

No I answered and started for the door

What he could hardly believe his ears By the Lord Harry the fellow
is crazy Six hundred and fifty then you infernal robber

No

NO Say what in thunder do you mean

I mean that you may go to the devil I retorted and reached for the
door knob

But before my fingers touched it there was the sound of laughter and
voices in the hall The knob was turned from without I stepped back and
to one side involuntarily as the door opened and into the library
came not the butler but a young lady a girl in an automobile coat and
bonnet And following her a young man

Father said the young lady Johnson says youve bought that horrid
road Im so glad When did you do it

Congratulations Mr Colton said the young man We just passed a
cart full of somethingseaweed I believe it wasas we came along with
the car Oscar had to slow down to squeeze by and we certainly were
swept by ocean breezes By Jove I can smell them yet I

The young lady interrupted him

Hush Victor she said I beg your pardon Father I thought you were
alone Victor were intruding

The open door had partially screened me from the newcomers But Colton
red and wrathful had not ceased to glare in my direction and she
following his gaze saw me She did not recognize me I thinkprobably
I had not made sufficient impression upon her mind even for casual
remembrancebut I recognized her She was the girl with the dark eyes
whose look of contemptuous indifference had so withered my selfesteem
And her companion was the young chap who from the tonneau of the
automobile that morning had inquired the way to Bayport

The young man turned lazily Are we he said IWhat Why Mabel
its the humorist

Then she recognized me I could feel the blood climbing from my toes
to the roots of my hair I was too astonished and chagrined to speak or
even move though I wanted to move very much indeed She looked at me
and I at her Then she turned coldly away

Come Victor she said

But Victor was his own blase self It took more than a trifle to shake
his calm He laughed

Its the humorist he repeated Reuben how are you

Colton regarded the three of us with amazement

What he began Mabel do you

But I had recovered my powers of locomotion I was on my way out of that
library

Here shouted Colton Stop

I did not stop Feeling as I did at that moment it would have been
distinctly unpleasant for the person who tried to stop me The girl was
in my way and as I approached she drew her skirts aside No doubt
it was my imagination which made her manner of doing it seem like an
insult but imagination or reality it was the one thing necessary to
clench my resolution Now when she looked at me I returned the look with
interest I strode through the doorway and across the hall The butler
would have opened the outer door for me but I opened it myself to the
imminent danger of his dignified nose As I stepped from the portico I
heard behind me a roar from Big Jim Colton and a shout of laughter from
Victor

I walked home at top speed Only once did I look back That was just as
I was about to enter the grove on the other side of the Shore Lane Then
I turned and saw at the big window at the end of the Newport villa
a group of three staring in my direction Colton his daughter and that
cub Victor The distance was too great to see the expression of their
faces but I knew that two of them at least were laughinglaughing at
me

I did not laugh

Lute was waiting for me by the gate and ran to meet me He was wild with
excitement

He came after you didnt he he cried grabbing at my coat sleeve
You went over to his house with him didnt you I see you and at fust
I couldnt scurcely believe it What did he want What did he say

I did not answer He ran along beside me still clinging to my sleeve

What did he want he repeated What did he say to you What did you
say to him Tell a feller cant you

I told him to go to the devil I answered savagely

Lute let go of my sleeve

YouyouBy time youre stark loony he gasped and collapsed
against the gate post

I went into the house up the back stairs to my room and shut the door



CHAPTER V


So she was his daughter I might have guessed it would have guessed
it if I had possessed the commonest of commonsense I might have known
that the auto was Coltons No other machine was likely to be traveling
on the Lower Road at that season of the year She was the pretty
daughter of whom Dorinda had spoken to Mother Well she was pretty
enough even I had to admit that But I admitted it grudgingly I hated
her for her beauty and fine clothes and haughty arrogance She was the
incarnation of snobbishness

But to be made twice ridiculous even by the incarnation of snobbishness
was galling She was to be my nextdoor neighbor we were likely to
meet almost anywhere at any time When I thought of this and of the two
meetings which had already taken place I swore at the blue and white
waterpitcher on my bureau because it did not contain water enough to
drown me Not that I would commit suicide on her account She would not
care if I did and certainly I did not care whether she would care or
not but if I were satisfactorily dead I probably should not remember
what a fool I had made of myself or Fate had made of me

Why had I not got out of that library before she came Oh if not why
hadnt I stayed and told her father in her hearing and with dignity
just what I thought of him and his remarks to me But no I had run
away Sheor that Victorwould tell of the meeting at the bridge and
all my independence and the rest of it would be regarded as of a piece
with that just the bigheaded smartness of a country boor In their
eyes I was a nuisance that was all A disagreeable one perhaps like
the Shore Lane but a nuisance one to laugh at and forgetif it could
not be gotten rid of

Why had I gone with Colton at all Why hadnt I remained at the
boathouse and there told the King of New York to go to the mischief or
words to that effect But I had at all events told him that In spite
of my chagrin I could not help chuckling as I thought of it To tell Big
Jim Colton to go to the devil was in its way I imagined a privilege
enjoyed by few It must have shaken his selfsatisfaction a trifle
Well after all what did I care He and his whole familyincluding
Victorhad my permission to migrate in that direction and I wished Old
Nick joy of their company

Having derived this much satisfaction from my reflections I went
downstairs Dorinda was setting the table for supper She looked at me
as I came in

Been visitin I hear she observed wiping an imaginary speck from
the corner of a plate with her afternoon apron

Yes said I

Umhm said Dorinda Have a good time

I smiled I had an interesting one I told her

Umhm I judged so from what Lute said

Where is Lute

Out in the barn beddin down the horse That is I told him to do
that but his head was so full of you and what you told him you said to
Mr Colton that I shouldnt be surprised if hes bedded down the hens
and was huntin in the manger for eggs

Lute thinks Ive gone crazy I observed

Umhm He was all for fetchin the doctor right off but I told him I
callated we could bear with your ravins for a spell Did you say what
he said you said

Im afraid I did

Umhm Well it didnt do any good did it

Good What do you mean

I mean he didnt obey ordersColton that is

He hadnt when I left

I thought not I never saw any good come from profane language yet
and besides judgin from what I hear about the way that Colton man
lives and what he does on Sundays and all hell make the port you sent
him to when his time comes All you need is patience

I laughed and she began sorting the plated spoons We had silver ones
but Dorinda insisted on keeping those to use when we had company In
consequence we used them about twice a year when the minister came

Of course she said I aint askin you what happened over there or
why he wanted to see you But I give you fair warnin that if I dont
Lute will Lutes so stuffed with curiosity that hes lible to bust the
stitches any minute

Ill tell you both at supper I said

Umhm said Dorinda Well I can wait and Lutell have to By
the way she added seeing me about to enter Mothers room if its
anything too unpleasant I wouldnt worry Comfort with it Shell want to
know of course but Id sort of smooth the edges

Mother did want to know and I told her smoothing the edges all I
could I omitted my final order to Big Jim and I said nothing whatever
about his daughter Mother seemed to think I had done right in refusing
to sell though as usual she was ready to make allowances for the
other side

Poor woman she said I suppose the noise of the wagons and all that
are annoying to any one with weak nerves It must be dreadful to be in
that condition I am so sorry for her

She meant it too But I remembering the Colton mansion what I had
seen of it and contrasting its splendor with the bare necessity of
that darkened bedroom found it hard to spare pity for the sufferer from
nerves

You neednt be I said bitterly I imagine she wouldnt think of
you if the conditions were reversed I doubt if she thinks of any one
but herself

You shouldnt say that Roscoe You dont know You have never met
her

I have met the rest of the family No Mother I think you neednt be
sorry for that woman She has everything under the sun Whereas you

Hush hush There is one thing she hasnt got She hasnt a son like
you Boy

Humph That must be a terrible deprivation There there Mother I
wont be disagreeable Lets change the subject Did Matilda Dean come
to see you this afternoon

No I presume she was too busy But Roscoe it is plain enough why
Captain Dean spoke to you about the Lane at the office this morning He
must have heard somehow that Mr Colton wished to buy it

Yes Or if he didnt hear just that he heard enough to make him guess
the rest He is pretty shrewd

You promised him you wouldnt sell without telling him beforehand
Shall you tell him of Mr Coltons offer

If he asks me I shall I suppose

I wonder what he will do then Do you suppose he will try to persuade
the Selectmen to buy the Lane for the town

I dont know I shouldnt wonder

It will be harder to refuse the towns offer

Yes Although the town cant afford to pay Coltons prices I believe
that man would have raised his bid to a thousand if I had let him As a
matter of business and nothing else I suppose I am foolish not to push
the price as high as possible and then sell The land is worthless to
us

I know But this isnt just a matter of business is it And we DONT
need the money Were not rich but we arent poor are we Boy

No No of course not But Mother just see what I could dofor
youwith a thousand dollars Why there are so many little things
little luxuries that you need

I had rather not get them that way No Roscoe I wouldnt sell to Mr
Colton And I think I wouldnt sell to the town either

Why not

Well because we dont have to sell and selling to either party would
make illfeeling I shouldof course Im only a woman you are a man
and know much more about such things than Ibut why not let matters
stay just as they are The townspeople can use the Lane just as they
have always done and as I told you before every one has been so kind
to us that I like to feel we are doing a little in return Let them use
the Lane without cost Why not

What do you think the Coltons would say to that

Perhaps they dont understand the real situation The next time you see
Mr Colton you could explain more fully tell him what the Lane means to
the town and so on Im sure he would understand if you told him that
And then if the sight of the wagons was too annoying he could put up
some kind of a screen or plant a row of fir trees by the fence Dont
you think so

I imagined the great mans reply to such a suggestion However I
did not express my thoughts I told Mother not to worry I was sure
everything would be all right and as Dorinda called me to supper I
went into the diningroom

Lute was waiting for me at the table and Dorinda after taking the
tray into Mothers room joined us Lute was so full of excitement and
curiosity that he almost forgot to eat a miracle of itself and made
greater by the fact that he did not ask a single question until his wife
asked one first Then he asked three in succession Dorinda who was
quite as curious as he but would not have shown it for the world
stopped him at the beginning of the fourth

There there she said sharply this is supposed to be a meal not a
parrot shop and were humans not a passel of birds on a telegraph wire
all hollerin at once Drink your tea and stop your cawin Lute Rogers
Rosll tell us when he gets ready What DID Mr Colton want of you
Roscoe

I told them as much of the interview at the Coltons as I thought
necessary they should know Lute kept remarkably quiet for him until
I named the figure offered by the millionaire Then he could hold in no
longer

Five hundred he repeated Five hundred DOLLARS for the Shore Lane
Five

He raised it to six hundred and fifty before I left I said

SIX hundred Six hundredand FIFTY For the Shore Lane Six hun

Sshh shh cut in Dorinda You sound like Sim Eldredge sellin
somethin at auction DO be quiet And you told him Roscoe

I told you what I told him I said

Umhm I aint forgot it Be quiet Lute Well Roscoe I callate you
know your own affairs best but judgin from some hints Matildy Dean
hove out when she was here this afternoon I dont believe youve heard
the last from that Shore Lane

Matilda Dean I repeated Why Mother said Matilda wasnt here
today

Umhm Well she was here though Comfort didnt know it I took pains
she shouldnt Matildy come about three oclock in the buggy along
with Nellie Nellie was doin the drivin of course and her mother
was tellin her how as usual I dont wonder that girl is such a
meek softspoken kind of thing Between her pas bullyin and her mas
tongue its a wonder shes got any spirit left It would be a mercy if
George Taylor should marry her and take her out of that house Matildy
had a new book on Spiritulism and she was figgerin to read some of it
out loud to Comfort but I headed her off I know _I_ wouldnt want to
be all stirred up about tests and materializations and such and so
I told her Comfort was asleep

She wasnt asleep neither declared Lute What did you tell such a
whopper as that for Youre always sailin into me if I stretch a yarn
the least mite Why last April Fool Day you give me Hail Columby for
jokin you about a mouse under the kitchen table Called me all kinds of
names you didafter you got down off the table

His wife regarded him scornfully Its pretty hard to remember which IS
that particlar day with you around she said Id told Comfort shed
ought to take a nap and if she want takin it twant my fault I want
goin to have her seein her granddads ghost in every corner But
anyhow Matildy made a little call on me and amongst the million other
things she said was somethin about Capn Jed hearin that Mr Colton
was callatin to shut off that Lane Matildy hinted that her husband
and the Selectmen might have a little to say afore twas closed If
thats so I guess you may hear from him as well as the Colton man
Roscoe

Perhaps I said I could see no use in repeating my conversation with
Captain Jed

Dorinda nodded

Goin to tell the town to gowhere you sent the other one she asked
dryly

I dont know

Humph Well with some sarcasm it must be fine to be in a position
where moneys no object I never tried it myself but it sounds good

I did not answer

Umhm she said Well anyhow it looks to meLute you keep
stillas if there was goin to be two parties in Denboro afore this
Lane business is over One for the Coltons and one against em Youll
have to take one side or the other wont you Roscoe

Not necessarily

Goin to set on the fence hey

Thats a good place TO sit isnt it

Dorinda smiled grimly

If its the right kind of a fence maybe tis she observed
Otherwise the pickets are liable to make you uncomftable after a
spell I presume likely

I went out soon after this for my evening smoke and walk by the bluff
As I left the diningroom I heard Lute reiterating his belief that I
had gone crazy Colton had said the same thing I wondered what Captain
Jeds opinion would be

Whether it was another phase of my insanity or not I dont know but
I woke the next morning in pretty good spirits Remembrance of the
previous days humiliations troubled me surprisingly little They did
not seem nearly so great in the retrospect What difference did it make
to me what that crowd of snobs did or said or thought

However there was just enough bitterness in my mornings review of
yesterdays happenings to make me a little more careful in my dress I
did not expect to meet my aristocratic neighborsI devoutly wished it
might be my good luck never to meet any of them againbut in making
selections from my limited wardrobe I chose with more thought than
usual Dorinda noticed the result when I came down to breakfast

Got your other suit on aint you she observed

Yes said I

Goin anywheres special

No Down to the boathouse thats all

Humph I dont see what you put those blue pants on for Theyre awful
things to show water spots Did you leave your brown ones upstairs
Umhm Well Ill get at em some time today I noticed they was
wearin a little sort of on the bottoms of the legs

I had noticed it too and this reminder confirmed my suspicions that
others had made the same observations

Ill try and mend em this afternoon went on Dorinda if I can find
time But for mercys sake dont spot those all up for I may not get
time and then youd have to wear your Sunday ones

I promised curtly to be careful and after saying good morning to
Mother I went down to the boathouse and set to work on the engine It
was the only thing in the nature of work that I had to do but somehow
or other I did not feel like doing it any more than I had the day
before A little of my good spirits were wearing off like the legs of
my other trousers and after an hour of intermittent tinkering I
threw down the wrench and decided to go for a row The sun was shining
brightly but the breeze was fresh and as my skiff was low in the
gunwale and there was likely to be some water flying I put on an old
oilskin slicker and souwester before starting

I had determined to row across the bay over to the lighthouse and ask
Ben Small the keeper if there were any signs of fish alongshore The
pull was a long one but I enjoyed every stroke of it The tide was
almost full just beginning to ebb so there was scarcely any current
and I could make a straight cut across instead of following the
tortuous channel My skiff was a flat bottomed affair drawing very
little but in Denboro bay at low tide even a flatbottomed skiff has
to beware of sand and eelgrass

Small was busy whitewashing but he was glad to see me If you keep a
lighthouse the average lighthouse you are glad to see anybody He put
his brush into the pail and insisted on my coming to the house because
the old woman his wife would want to hear all the sewin circle
news Its the biggest hardship of her life said Ben that she has
to miss sewin circle when the bay ices in Soons it clears shes at me
to row her acrost to the meetins Ive took her to two this spring
but she missed the last one on account of this whitewashin and shes
crazy to know whos been talked about now If anything disgraceful has
happened for the land sakes tell her then shell he more reconciled

I had nothing disgraceful to tell but Mrs Small was glad to see
me nevertheless She brought out doughnuts and beachplum jelly and
insisted on my sampling both the doughnuts because they were just made
and she mistrusted there was too much flour in them and the jelly
because it was some she had left over and she wanted to see if I thought
it was keepin all right After this Ben took me out to see his
hens and then we walked to the back of the beach and talked fish The
forenoon was almost gone when I got back to the skiff The tide had
ebbed so far that the lightkeeper and I had to pull the little boat
twenty feet to launch her

There said Ben now youre afloat aint you Callate youll have
to go way round Robin Hoods barn to keep off the flats I forgot about
the tide or I wouldnt have talked so much Hello theres another craft
about your size off yonder Somebody else out rowin Two somebodys My
eyes aint as good for pickin em out as they used to be but one of em
IS a female aint it

I looked over my shoulder as I sat in the skiff and saw out in the
middle of the bay another rowboat with two people in it

That aint a dory or a skiff shouted Ben raising his voice as
I pulled away from him Way she sets out of water Id call her a
lapstreak dingy If that fellers takin his girl out rowin hell have
to work his passage home against this tide    Well so long Ros
Come again

I nodded a goodby and settled down for my long row a good deal longer
this time on account of the ebb There was water enough on this side of
the bay but on the village side the channel made a wide detour and
I should be obliged to follow it for nearly a mile up the bay before
turning in behind the long sand bar which made out from the point beyond
my boathouse

The breeze had gone down which made rowing easier but the pull of the
tide more than offset this advantage However I had mastered that tide
many times before and except that the delay might make me late for
dinner the prospect did not trouble me I swung into the channel and
set the skiffs bow against the current Then from the beach I had just
left I heard a faint hail Turning my head I saw Ben Small waving his
arms He was shouting something too but I was too far away to catch
the words

The lightkeeper continued to shout and wave I lifted an oar to show
that he had my attention He recognized the signal and began pointing
out over the water astern of me I looked where he was pointing I could
not see anything out of the ordinary Except for my own skiff and the
gulls and the row boat with the two persons in it there was nothing
astir on the bay But Ben kept on waving and pointing At last I decided
that it must be the row boat he was pointing at I stopped rowing and
looked

The row boat was a good distance off and its occupants were but specks
Now one of the specks stood up and waved its arms So far as I could
see the boat was drifting there were no flashes of sunlight on wet
blades to show that the oars were in use No it was drifting and as I
looked it swung broadside on The standing figure continued to wave its
arms

Those people must be in trouble of some sort I decided and it was
evident that Small thought so too There could no imminent danger
threaten for on a day like this with no sea running there was nothing
to fear in the bay If however they should drift out of the bay it
might be unpleasant And they certainly were drifting I resigned myself
to the indefinite postponement of my dinner swung the skiff about and
pulled as hard as I could in the direction of the row boat

With the tide to help me I made good progress but even at that it
took me some time to overtake the drifting craft She was as Ben had
said a lapstreaked keelbottomed dingygood enough as a yachts
tender or in deep water but the worst boat in the world to row about
Denboro bay at low tide Her high rail caught what breeze there was
blowing and this helped to push her along However I got within easy
hailing distance after a while and called over my shoulder to ask what
was the matter

A mans voice answered me

Weve lost an oar he shouted Were drifting out to sea Lend us a
hand will you

All right I answered Ill be there in a minute

Within the minute I was almost alongside Then I turned intending to
speak again but I did not The two persons in the dingy were VictorI
did not know his other nameand Mabel Colton

I was wearing the oilskin slicker and had pulled down the brim of
my souwester to keep the sun from my eyes therefore they had not
recognized me before And I busy at the oars and looking over my
shoulder only occasionally had not recognized them Now the recognition
was mutual Miss Colton spoke first

Why Victor she said it is

What asked her companion Then looking at me Oh its you is it

I did not answer Luck was certainly against me No matter where I went
on land or water I was fated to meet these two

Victor apparently was thinking the same thing By Jove he observed
Mabel we seem destined to    Humph Well Will you give us a hand

The most provoking part of it was that if I had known who was in that
rowboat I could have avoided the encounter Ben Small could have gone
to their rescue just as well as I However here I was and here they
were And I could not very well go away and leave them under the
circumstances

Victors patience was giving way

What are you waiting for he demanded Arent you going to help us
Well pay you for it

I pulled the skiff a little closer and drawing in my oars turned and
picked up the slack of my anchor rope

Here I said brusquely catch this line and Ill tow you

I tossed him the loop of rope and he caught it

What shall I do with it he asked

Hold it just as it is for the present What became of your other
oar

Lost it overboard

Why didnt you throw over your anchor and wait where you were

I think he had not thought of the anchor but he did not deign to
explain Instead he began pulling on the rope and the two boats drew
together

Dont do that I said Wait

I untied the rope where it was made fast to the skiffs bow and with
it and the anchor in my hands scrambled aft and wedged the anchor under
the stern thwart of the little craft

Now I said you can pull in the slack until you get to the end Then
make it fast to your bow somewhere

I suppose he did his best to follow instructions but the rope was a
short one the end jerked loose suddenly and he went backward in a heap
I thought for an instant that he was going overboard and that mine
would be the mixed pleasure of fishing him out

Miss Colton gave a little scream which changed to a ripple of laughter
I might have laughed too under different circumstances but just now I
did not feel like it Besides the rope having flown out of his hands
was in the water again and the two boats were drifting apart

What did you do that for demanded the fallen one scrambling to his
knees I heard a sound from the dingys stern as if the young lady was
trying to stifle her merriment Victor doubtless heard it too

Where are you going he sputtered angrily Give me that rope

I gave it to him literally gave it for I pulled alongside and put the
end in his hands

Tie it in the bow of your boat I said He did so I drew in the slack
until a fair towing length remained and made it fast While he was busy
I ventured to glance at Miss Colton Her eyes were snapping with fun
and she seemed to be enjoying the situation But catching my look her
expression changed She turned away and looked indifferently out to sea

I swung the skiffs bow around

Where do you want to go I asked

Victor answered Back to Mr Coltons landing he said Get as much
of a move on as you can will you Ill make it worth your while

I was as anxious to get there as he was I did not care for a quarrel
and I knew if he continued to use that tone in his remarks to me I
should answer as I felt I pulled with all my strength but against the
tide towing was hard work

Victor sat on the amidships thwart of the dingy with his back to me
But Miss Colton seated in the stern was facing me and I could not help
looking at her She did not look at me or if she did it was as if I
were merely a part of the view nothing to be interested in one way or
the other

She was beautiful there was no doubt of that Prettier even in the
blue and white boating costume and roughandready white felt hat than
she had seemed when I saw her in the auto or her fathers library She
represented the world that I had lost I had known girls like her They
had not as much money as she perhaps but they were just as wellbred
and refined and almost as pretty I had associated with them as an
equal I wondered what she would say or think if she knew that
Nothing probably she would not care enough to think at all It did
not matter to me what she thought but I did wish I had not put on those
fool oilskins I must look more like a country longshoreman than ever

If I had any doubts about it they were dispelled when I had rowed the
two boats up the bay until we were abreast the Colton mansion Then
Victor who had been talking in a low tone with his fellow passenger in
the dingy looked at the distant shore and over his shoulder at me

Here he shouted Where are you going Thats the landing over
there

I know I answered But we shall have to go around that flat We
cant cross here

Why Whats the reason we cant

Because there isnt water enough We should get aground

He stood up to look

Nonsense he said Theres plenty of water I cant see any flat or
whatever you call it

Its there though you cant see it It is covered with eelgrass and
doesnt show We shall have to go a half mile further before we turn
in

A half mile Why confound it its past one oclock now We havent
any time to waste

Im sorry but we cant cross yet And if I were you I shouldnt
stand up in that boat

He paid no attention to this suggestion

There are half a dozen boats bigger than these by the landing he
declared There is water enough for them What are you afraid of We
havent any time to waste I tell you

I did not answer Silence on my part was the safest thing just then I
continued rowing up the bay

Miss Colton spoke to him and he sat down a proceeding for which I was
thankful They whispered together for a moment Then he turned to me

See here he said this lady and I have an appointment We must get
ashore Go straight in If youre afraid Ill take the risk If there is
any danger Ill pay for that too

There was no question of risk It was a certainty I knew that channel

We cant cross here I said shortly

Why confound you

Victor cautioned Miss Colton

Hush Mabel This is ridiculous You and I saw two boats go straight
out from the beach this morning We went out that way ourselves Here
youPaine or whatever your name isweve had enough of this Ive
hired you to take us ashore and I want to go there and not a half mile
in another direction Will you do as I tell you

When the dingy and the other boats crossed the flat the tide had been
hours higher of course but I was in no mood to explainto him

No I said shortly

You wont Then you give me an oar and Ill row the rest of the way
myself

There were only two oars in the skiff but I could get on perfectly well
with one And it would serve him beautifully right to let him go But
there was the girl I hesitated

Give me that oar he repeated angrily You wont Then by Jove
Ill do without it Stop Stop where you are do you understand We
dont require your services any longer

He turned and began untying the tow line I stopped rowing

Miss Colton looked troubled

Victor she cried What are you doing

I know what Im doing Cant you see this fellows game The longer the
row the higher his price thats all He cant work me Ive seen his
kind before Dont be frightened If we cant do anything else we can
anchor and wait until they see us from the house

Idiot At that point the channel was deep and the bottom soft mud I
doubted if his anchor would touch and if it did I knew it would not
hold I backed water and brought the skiff alongside the dingy the rail
of which I seized and held

Keep off ordered Victor still fumbling with the rope We dont want
your help

I wasted no breath on him I addressed my remarks to the girl

Miss Colton I said will you listen to me please You cant anchor
here because your anchor will not hold And you cant cross that flat at
this stage of the tide I can give you an oar of course but it wont
do any good My oars are too light and small for your boat Unless you
wish to drift back where you were or beyond you must let me tow you
around the head of this flat

I dont know what answer she might have made None perhaps although I
am sure she was listening But Victor who had succeeded in untying the
tow line cut in ahead of her

Mabel he warned dont pay any attention to him Didnt your father
tell us what he was There throwing the end of the rope overboard
and addressing me now you may clear out Weve done with you
Understand

I looked at Miss Colton But I might as well have looked at an iceberg
I slid one of my oars over into the dingy

There you are I said grimly But I warn you that youre in for
trouble

I let go of the rail and the boats fell apart Victor seized the
borrowed oar with a triumphant laugh

Your bluff wouldnt work would it Reuben he sneered Ill send you
the oar and your pay later Now Mabel sit tight Ill have you ashore
in fifteen minutes

He began rowing toward the weedcovered flat I said nothing I
was furiously angry and it was some moments before I recovered
selfpossession sufficiently to get my remaining oar over the skiffs
stern and by sculling hold her against the tide Then I watched and
waited

It was not a long wait Victor was in difficulties almost from the
beginning The oar belonging to the dingy was a foot longer than the one
I had given him and he zigzagged wildly Soon he was in the edge of the
eelgrass and catching crabs first on one side then on the other
The dingys bow slid up on the mud He stood up to push it off and the
stern swung around Getting clear he took a fresh start and succeeded
only in fouling again This time he got further into the tangle before
he grounded The bow rose and the stern settled There was a mighty
splashing as Victor pushed and tugged but the dingy stuck fast And
there she would continue to stick for four hours unless I or some one
else helped her off

I did not want to help In fact I looked all up and down the bay before
I made a move But it was dinner time and there was not another soul
afloat More than that I noticed as I had not noticed before that
brown cloudswind cloudswere piling up in the west and if I was
anything of a prophet we would have squalls and dirty weather long
before those four hours were over And the dingy in that position was
not safe to face a blow No as the small boys say it was up to me I
wished it was not but it was

So again I went to the rescue but this time in an entirely different
frame of mind My anger and resentment had settled to a cold
determination and this trip was purely business I was not at a
disadvantage now as I had been when I first met that girl and her
friend in Big Jim Coltons library I was master of this situation
and master I intended to be

I sculled the skiff straight in to the edge of the flat at a point
where the bank sloped sharply to deep water I threw over my anchor
shortened the rope and made it fast Then I stepped out into water above
my shoe tops and waded toward the dingy The water was icy cold but I
did not know it at the time

I splashed through the eelgrass Victor saw me coming and roared an
angry protest He was still trying to push the boat off with an oar

Here he shouted You keep away We dont want you

I did not care what he wanted I splashed alongside the dingy and looked
at her and the position she was in My mind was made up instantly

Youll never get her off if you both stay aboard I said Let the
lady move amidships and you get out and wade

He glared at me as if I were as crazy as Colton or Lute had declared me
to be Then he laughed contemptuously

You go back where you came from he ordered Im running this

Yes Ive noticed that Now Ill state the facts as plainly as I can
This boat is fast aground in the mud the tide is still going out and
there are squalls coming She must be got off or there may be danger
You cant get her off until she is lightened Will you get out and
wade

He did not answer instead he continued to push with the oar I turned
to the girl

Miss Colton I said I must ask you to stand up Be careful when you
rise

She made no move nor did she reply The look she gave me was enough

You must stand up I repeated firmly Either yourthis
gentlemanmust get out as I tell him to or I shall have to carry you
to my skiff We havent any time to spare

She gazed at me in blank astonishment Then the color flamed in her
cheeks and her eyes flashed

We dont wish your help she said icily

Im sorry but that makes no difference I

Victor whirled on me the oar in his hands I thought for an instant he
was going to strike me with it

You blackguard he shouted Will you go away

I looked at him and then at her It had to be done and my mind was made
up to do it I waded in until the water was almost to my knees and I
was abreast the stern of the stranded boat

Miss Colton I said I am going to carry you to my skiff Are you
ready

YouWhy she breathed

I stooped lifted her in my arms and ploughed through the weeds and
water The mud was soft and my feet sank into it She struggled

You must keep still I said sharply or I shall drop you

She gasped but she stopped struggling From behind me I heard a roar of
rage from Victor

I carried her to the anchored skiff and plunging in still deeper
seated her on the stern thwart

Sit there please and dont move I said I shall be back as soon as
Ive got your boat afloat

I waded back to the dingy Victor was frantic but he did not disturb
me The worst of my unpleasant job was over

Now sit down I ordered Do you hear me Sit down and sit still

Youyou he stammered

Because if you dont sit down I continued serenely youre likely to
tumble overboard Im going to push this boat off

The first push helped to make up his mind He sat involuntarily I
pushed with all my might and slowly and jerkily the dingy slid off
the shoal But there were others all about With one hand on the bow
I guided her between them and to the edge of the channel Then wading
along the slippery bank I brought her to the skiff My passenger had
been making remarks in transit but I paid no attention to them

I made the rope fast for towing took my oar from the dingy pulled up
the skiffs anchor and climbed aboard

Sit where you are I said to Victor Miss Colton please keep as
still as possible

I ventured to look at her as I said this but I looked but once All the
way home I kept my gaze fixed on the bottom boards of the skiff

I made the landing just in time In fact the squall struck before I was
abreast the Colton place The channel beyond the flat which we had so
lately left was whipped to whitecaps in a moment and miniature breakers
were beating against the mud bank where the dingy had grounded

Under the high bluff it was calm enough The tide was too low to make
use of the little wharf so I beached the skiff and drew the towed
boat in by the line I offered to assist Miss Colton ashore but she
apparently did not see my proffered hand Victor scrambled out by
himself No one said anything I untied the rope and pulled it in Then
I prepared to push off

Here growled Victor Wait a minute

I looked up He was standing at the edge of the water with one hand in
his pocket Miss Colton was behind him

Well I asked

I havent paid you yet he said sullenly How much

What do you mean I asked I knew of course but it pleased me to
make him say it

Why how much for towing us in Whats your price Come hurry up

I havent any price Im not in the salvage business

NotSay dont bargain Whats your price I ask you

Nothing of course Very glad to have been of assistance

I took up my oars

Here he shouted Stop hold on Confound you do you suppose we
dont intend to pay you for this

I shook my head It has been a pleasure I said sweetly Good day

I rowed off but all the way down to my boathouse I smiled contentedly
I had seen the look on Mabel Coltons face I rather thought I had
evened the account between us at least I had reduced the balance a
trifle This time it was not I who appeared ridiculous

Dorinda saw me when I entered the kitchen Her hands were upraised

My soul and body she exclaimed LOOK at them pants LOOK at em And
I aint had time to put a needle to your other ones yet



CHAPTER VI


The rain which I expected would follow the squall did not come until
late that night and it was still falling heavily the next morning
It was a warm rain however and after breakfast I walked up to the
village I said nothing even to Mother about the happenings in the
bay and Dorinda who had asked many sarcastic questions concerning the
state of my blue trousersif I had mistook em for a bathin suit and
the likeseemed satisfied with my hurried explanation that I had gotten
overboard Though how you fell in feet fust she observed I dont
see She had mended my brown pair sitting up until after two to do so

Lute informed me that he had been up to the postoffice Everybodys
talkin about them Coltons he declared I see their automobile last
night myself The Colton girl she come into the store My shes a
stunner aint she Sim waited on her himself and gave her the mail
She wanted to buy some cheesefor a rabbit she said I never heard of
feeding a rabbit on cheese did you Ros

No I replied laughing It was not worth while to explain

Nor nobody else but her I guess continued Lute likely she was
just jokin Anyhow Sim was all out of cheese but he had some nice
print butter just in She didnt want no butter though

Humph sniffed Dorinda Did Sim Eldredge callate she wanted to feed
the rabbit butter Was the Colton girl alone

No There was a young feller with her the one thats visitin em
Carver his name isVictor Carver Did you ever hear such a name in your
life Afore Id name a child of mine Victor

Umhm Well I wouldnt waste time worryin about that if I was you
Look here Lute Rogers you didnt say anything about Roscoes talk with
Mr Colton did you

No no no no Course I didnt

You sure

Yes Taint likely I would would I Capn Jed was on hand as usual
and he was full of questions but he didnt get anything out of me
What did Colton say to Ros he says How do I know what he said
says I I want there was I Where was you that forenoon he says
Forenoon says I that shows how much you know about it Twas three
oclock in the afternoon Oh I had the laugh on him

Dorinda looked at me and shook her head

Its too bad Roscoe she said But I was afraid of it as soon as I
found hed sneaked off to the postoffice I callate its all over town
by now

What do you mean by that Lutes dignity was outraged All over town
I never told him nothin

No Only that Ros and Mr Colton were together and twas three oclock
in the afternoon And goodness knows how much more DO be quiet Seems
sometimes as if I should lose patience with you altogether Is this
Carver the Colton girls young man Are they engaged

I dont know I guess hes keepin company with her by the looks I
got as nigh to em as I could but I didnt hear much they said Only
just as they was goin out he said somethin about goin for a little
spin in the car She said no her father would want his letters Carver
he said why not send Oscar homethats the chauffeur you knowwith
the letters and hed run the car himself She kind of laughed and said
she guessed not shed taken one trip with him already that day and she
didnt believe she cared for another He seemed kind of put out about
it I thought

I had been feeling rather provoked at Lute for giving Captain Jed the
information concerning my interview with Colton but somehow this
other bit of news restored my good humor When I started for the village
I did not take the short cut across the fields but followed my regular
route the path by the bluff and the Shore Lane I was no longer fearful
of meeting my new neighbors The memory of the happenings in the bay was
a delightful solace to my wounded selfrespect I chuckled over it as
I walked through the dripping pines of the little grove No matter how
contemptuously indifferent that girl might pretend to be she would
not forget what had taken place that she had been obliged to obey my
orders that I had carried her to that skiff that I had saved her from
a dangernot a great danger and against her will of coursebut saved
her nevertheless She was under an obligation to me she could not help
herself How that must gall her I remembered the look on her face as I
rowed away Sweet was revenge And VictorVictor was a joke

When I reached the Lane I looked over at the Colton mansion The rain
had given the carpenters and painters an enforced holiday and except
for the chauffeur whom I could see through the open door of the garage
there was no one in sight I think I was a little disappointed If Big
Jim had appeared and hailed me with another offer for the land I should
not have dodged I was ready for him But neither he or any one else
appeared and I walked on

At the Corners Sim Eldredge shouted to me from the platform of his
store

Hi Ros he shouted You Ros Paine come here a minute will you

I did not want to see him I had intended avoiding the postoffice
altogether But I crossed to the platform

Say Ros he asked eagerly whats this about you and Mr Colton

I was annoyed

What do you mean I asked

Why you know dont you He come to see you and you went to see him
over to his house You had a reglar argument I understand About the
Shore Lane want it

Who told you that I inquired sharply

Why nobody told me exactly Lute Rogers and Capn Jed was here last
night and they got agoin as usual The Capn does love to stir up
Lute and he commenced hintin about somethin of the kind I dont know
as they was hints either but Lute thought they was

He grinned I understood

I see I said Well what did Lute say

I suppose hed say he never said a word but after hed gone there was
a kind of general sentiment that Colton wanted to buy the Shore Lane
land off you and that you and he had some words about it Anyhow you
didnt sell the land did you

Suppose I did or didnt what of it

Why nothin nothin Only I tell you Ros he looked carefully
about to make sure no one was listening I tell you its just this
way I can understand how you feel about it You know Dean and some of
the others are sore on Mr Colton cause hes got more money than they
have and they want to make all the trouble for him they can Jeds got
an idea that hes after that Lane to close it off and hes stirrin up
sentiment against its bein closed Hes talkin about the town buyin
it Now of course I know your position You want to get just as high a
price as you can afore you sell

Thats my position is it

It would be the position of any sensible man wouldnt it I dont
blame you Now what I wanted to say was this He bent forward and
lowered his voice to a whisper Why dont you let me handle this thing
for you I can do it bettern you I see Capn Jed every night you
might say And I see considerble of Mr Colton He knows Im postmaster
in this town and sort of prominent All the smart folks aint in the
Board of Selectmen Ill keep you posted see You just set back and
pretend you dont want to sell at all Colton hell bid and Jed and
his gangll bid Ill tell each what the other bids and well keep her
jumpin When we get to the last jump well selland not afore Of
course Mr Colton ll get it in the end

Oh he will What makes you think so

What makes me think so Dont be foolish Aint he a millionaire How
can Denboro stand up against a millionaire I tell you Ros its money
counts in this world and it pays to stand in with them thats got it
Im goin to stand in with Mr Colton But Ill pretend to stand in with
Dean just as much I can help a whole lot Why I shouldnt wonder if
between us we could getererI dont know how much for that land
What do you say

I smiled Its very kind of you Sim to be willing to go to so much
trouble on my account I observed I didnt know there was such
disinterested kindness in Denboro

Sim seemed a bit put out Why he stammered IIof
course I presumed likely youd be willin to pay me a little
commissionororsomethin I thought I might be a sort oferagent
for you Ive handled considerble real estate in my timeandyou see
what I mean dont you

Yes I said drily I see Well Sim if I decide to engage an agent
Ill let you know Good morning

But hold on Ros I

I did not hold on I walked across the road and entered the bank
Alvin Baker met me in the vestibule He seized my hand and shook it
violently

I declare he exclaimed it does me good to shake hands with a feller
thats got the grit you have It does so Were all proud of you

Much obliged Alvin Im sure But why

He winked and nudged me with his elbow

You know why all right he whispered Wouldnt sell him the land
would you Tell me Did he make you a real bid for it Lute as much as
said he did

For a person who had told nothing Lute seemed to have as much as said
a good many things I shook my head

So you think I shouldnt sell the land I asked

Course you shouldntnot to him Aint there such things as public
spirit and independence But Ill tell you somethin more Ros
mysteriously You may have a chance to sell it somewhere else

Indeed

Yes siree indeed Theres other publicspirited folks in Denboro as
well as you I know who they be and I stand in with em pretty close
too Im goin to help you all I can

Thats very kind of you Alvin

No no Im glad to do it Shant charge you nothin neither

Thats kinder still

No taint   Hold on a minute Ros Dont go As I say Im goin
to work tooth and nail to get the town to buy that Lane property of
yours Ill stick out for youre gettin a good price for it Ill use
all my influence

Thank you

You neednt thank me Its a matter of principle Well show these city
folks they aint the whole ship cargo and all    Hold on a second
more Ros IerI wonder if youd do a little favor for me

What is it Alvin

Why its this way Ive got a note here in the bank put it there when
I bought the power engine for my catboat Hundred and fifty dollars
tis Youre a pretty good friend of George Taylor cashier here and I
was wonderin if youd mind puttin in a word with him about my gettin
it renewed when it comes due Just tell him you think Im all right and
a good risk or somethin like that

I could not help smiling Alvin seemed to find encouragement in the
smile

George thinks considerble of you he said And Captain Jedhes one
of the directorshe will too now that youve stood up to Colton Just
put in a word for me will you And dont forget Im a friend of yours
and Im strong for your gettin a good fair price from the town
Remember that wont you

I wont forget Alvin Goodby

I left him and went into the bank Henry Small the bookkeeper was at
his desk I walked over to speak to him but he looking up from his
figures spoke first There was or so it seemed to me a different note
in his greeting It was more hearty I thought Certainly he regarded me
with a new and curious interest

Morning Ros he said Well how are you these days

I answered that I was well and was moving on but he detained me

Lively times ahead hey he whispered

What sort of times I asked

He winked I guess you know if anybody does he observed All right
youll have good friends on your side I aint saying anything of
course but Im on all right

He winked again I walked back to the cashiers window Taylor had
evidently seen me talking with the bookkeeper for he was standing by
the little gate waiting for me

Hello Ros he said Glad to see you Come in

George Taylor was a type of smart country boy grown to manhood in
the country His tone like his manner was sharp and quick and
businesslike but he spoke with the DownEast twang and used the Cape
phrases and metaphors He was younger than I but he looked older and
of late it had seemed to me that he was growing more nervous We shook
hands

Glad to see you he said again I was hoping youd drift in I
presumed likely you might Sit down

I took the proffered chair He looked at me with much the same curious
interest that Small had shown

Weve been hearing about you he said Youve been getting yourself
talked about

I mentally cussed Lute once more for his loquacity

Ill break the fellows neck I declared with emphasis

He laughed Dont do that yet awhile he said The market is in bad
enough shape as it is If his neck was broke the whole of Wall Street
would go to pot

Wall Street What in the world has Lute got to do with Wall Street

Lute Oh I see Yes Lutes been doing considerable talking but it
aint his neck I mean Say Ros what did you do to him anyway You
stirred him up some judging by what he said to me

Who said What

Why Colton He was in here yesterday Opened what he called a
household account that was his main business But he asked about you
along with it

This explained some things It was clear now why Small had appeared so
interested Oh I said

You bet he did Wanted to know if I knew you and what you were and so
on I told him I knew you pretty well What sort of a fellow is he
A damn fool he asked I strained the truth enough to say you were a
pretty good fellow and a long ways from that kind of a fool according
to my reckoning Umph says he Is he rich I told him I guessed you
want so rich that you got roundshouldered lugging your money Why
says I getting curious Have you met him Mr Colton If you have you
ought to have sized him up yourself I always heard you were a pretty
fair judge He looked at me kind of funny I thought I was says he
but you seem to raise a new variety down here Then I guess he thought
hed said enough At any rate he walked off What did you and he say to
each other Ros

I did not answer immediately When I did the answer was noncommittal
Oh we had a business interview I said

He nodded Well he observed I suppose its your affair and not
mine But I tell you this Ros if its what I suppose it is itll be
everybodys affair pretty soon

You think so do you

I know so Capn Jeds a fighter and he is on the war path The two
sides are lining up already Whichever way you decide youll make
enemies of course

I shrugged my shoulders The prospect of enemies more or less in
Denboro did not trouble me

But youll have to decide he went on who youll sell to

Or not sell at all I suggested

Can you afford to do that Therell be moneya whole lot of moneyin
this before its over if I know the leaders on both sides Youve got
the whiphand Therell be money in it Can you afford to let it slip

I did not answer Suddenly his expression changed He looked haggard and
careworn

By the Almighty he said between his teeth and without looking at
me I wish I had your chance

Why

Oh nothing nothing    Hows your mother nowadays

I told him that my mother was much as usual and we talked of various
things

By the way he said Ive got some news for you Nothing surprising
I guess all hands have seen it coming Im engaged to be married

Good said I with as much heartiness as I could answer marriage did
not interest me Congratulations George Nellie Dean of course

Yes

Im glad for you And for her Shell make you a good wife Im sure

He drew a long breath Yes he said slowly Nellies a good girl

When is thewhat do they call it the happy event to take place

In the fall some time if all goes well I hope it will

Humph Yes I should think you might hope as much as that Why
shouldnt it go well

Hey Oh of course it will He laughed and rose from his chair as
several men came into the bank Ill have to leave you Ros he said
Theres a directors meeting this morning Theyre coming now

As I passed out of the gate and through the group of directors I noticed
that they also regarded me with interest Two men from neighboring
towns whom I scarcely knew whispered to each other Captain Elisha
Warren shook hands with me and inquired concerning Mother The last of
the group was Captain Jedediah Dean and he touched me on the shoulder

Ros he whispered youre all right Understand I say youre all
right

Thanks I answered briefly

I heard about it he whispered Ase Peters said the Grand Panjandrum
was cranky as a shark with the toothache all day yesterday You must
tell me the yarn when we get together I missed you when I called just
now but Ill be down again pretty soon You wont lose nothin by this
So long

As I came down the bank steps Sim Eldredge called across the road

Goodby Ros he shouted Come in again next time youre up street

In all my period of residence in Denboro I had never before been treated
like this People had never before gone out of their way to shake hands
with me No one had considered it worth while to ask favors of me
Sim and Alvin were not to be taken seriously of course and both were
looking after their own pocketbooks but their actions were straws
proving the wind to be blowing in my direction I thought and smiled
scornfully that I all at once seemed to have become a person of some
importance

But my scorn was not entirely sincere There was a certain gratification
in the thought I might pretendI had pretendedthat Denboro opinion
good or bad was a matter of complete indifference to me I had assumed
myself a philosopher to whom in the consciousness of right such
trifles were of no consequence But philosophy or not the fact
remained that I was pleased People might dislike meas that lofty
Colton girl and her father disliked me though they could dislike me
no more than I did thembut I could compel them to respect me They
already must think of me as a man And so onas I walked home through
the wet grass It was all as foolish and childish and ridiculous as it
well could be I deserved what was coming to meand I got it

For as I came down the Lane I met Oscar the chauffeur and a
companion whom I judged to be a fellow servantthe coachman I learned
afterwardswalking in the direction of the village The rain had
ceased but they wore natty raincoats and caps and had the city air of
smartness which I recognized and envied even in them The footpath was
narrow but they apparently had no intention of stepping to one side
so I made way for them They whispered together as they approached and
looked at me curiously as we passed A few steps further on I heard them
both burst out laughing I caught the words from Oscar fool Rube and
the old manll make him look I heard no more but as I turned into
the grove I saw them both looking after me with broad grins on their
faces

Somebody has said that there is nothing harder to bear than the contempt
and ridicule of servants For one thing you cannot resent it without a
loss of dignity and for another you may be perfectly sure that theirs
is but the reflection of their employers frame of mind This encounter
shook my selfsatisfaction more than a little It angered me but it did
more than that it brought back the feeling I had when I left the Colton
library that my defiance was not after all taken seriously That I
was regarded by Colton as just what Oscar had termed me a fool Rube
When George Taylor told me of the great mans questions concerning my
foolishness I accepted the question as a tribute to my independence
Now I was not so sure

Dorinda met me at the door

Youve had two callers she said

So Who were they

One of em was Capn Jed He drove down just after you left He come to
see you about that land I callate

Oh yes I remember he told me he missed me this morning So he came
here

Umhm Him and me had a little talk He seemed to know considerble
about your rumpus with Mr Colton

How did he know

He wouldnt say but I wouldnt wonder if he got a lot from Ase Peters
Ase and he are pretty thick hes got a mortgage on Ases house you
know And Ase bein as hes doin the carpenterin over to Coltons
hears a lot from the servants I spose likely Leastways if they dont
tell all their bosses affairs theyre a new breed of hired help thats
all Ive got to say Capn Jed says Mr Colton callates youre a fool

Yes So Ive heard What did the Captain say to that

Seemed to think twas a pretty good joke He said he didnt care how
big a fool you was so longs you was feebleminded on the right side

So there it was again My imagined importance in the eyes of the
townspeople simmered down to about that I was an imbecile but they
must pretend to believe me something else because I owned something they
wanted Well I still owned it

Of course continued Dorinda I didnt tell him you was figgerin not
to sell the land at all If I had I spose hed have thought

She stopped short

You suppose what I asked

Oh nothin

She had said enough I could guess the rest I walked to the window and
stood looking out The clouds were breaking and as I stood there a
ray of sunlight streamed through a rift and struck the bay just at the
spot where the dingy had grounded The shallow water above the flat
flashed into fire I am not superstitious as a general thing but the
sight comforted me It seemed like an omen There was the one bright
spot in the outlook There at least I had not behaved like a fool
Rube There I had compelled respect and been taken seriously

Dorinda spoke again

You aint asked who your other caller was she observed

Was there another

Umhm I told you there was two After Capn Jed left that chauffeur
feller from the big house come here He fetched a note for you Here
tis

I took the note It was addressed to me in a mans handwriting not that
of Big Jim Colton I opened the envelope and read


Roscoe Paine

Sir The enclosed is in payment for your work No receipt is necessary

Yours truly

B VICTOR CARVER


The enclosed was a fivedollar bill

I stood staring at the note Then I began to laugh

Whats the joke asked Dorinda who had not taken her eyes from my
face

This said I handing her the money She looked at it in astonishment

Umhm she said drily Well Iwell a fivedollar bill may be a
joke to you but _I_ aint familiar enough with one to laugh at it You
dont laugh as if twas awful funny either Whos the joke on

Its on me just now

Umhm Id be willin to be joked ten times a day at that price And
Id undertake to laugh heartier than youre doin too Whats it for
the money I mean

Its for some work I did yesterday

She was more astonished than ever

Work You she exclaimed

Yes But dont worry I shant do it again

Land THAT wouldnt worry me What sort of work was it

Oh II picked up something adrift in the bay

Umhm I see Somethin belongin to the Coltons I spose likely Why
wont you do it again Aint they paid you enough

Again I laughed They have paid me too much I said bitterly What I
picked up wasnt worth the money



CHAPTER VII


And that in the end was the answer I sent to Carver with his five
dollars I spent an hour in my room trying to compose and write a
sarcastic reply to his note but I finally gave it up Then I put the
money in an envelope addressed the latter and sent it to the big house
by Lute Lute was delighted with the errand

Youll explain to Dorindy will you he asked She callates Im
goin to clean the henhouse But I can do that some other time

You canyes

Do you know Lute leaned against the clothes post and prepared to
philosophize Do you know he observed that I dont take no stock in
cleanin henhouses and such

Dont you Im surprised

Youre surprised cause you aint thought it out Thats my way I
always think things out Most folks are selfish They want to do what
they want to do and they want others to want the same thing If the
others dont want it then they like to make em have it anyhow
Dorindy is crazy on cleanin She wouldnt live in a dirty house no
moren shed live in a lobster pot Its the way shes made But a hen
aint made that way A hen LIKES dirt she scratches in it and digs
holes in it to waller in and heaves it over herself all day long If
you left it to the hens would THEY clean their house I guess not So I
say whats the use of cruelizin em by makin em live clean when they
dont want to I

Wait a minute I interrupted Lute youre wasting your breath It is
Dorinda you should explain all this to not to me And youre wasting my
time I want you to take that envelope to Mr Carver and I want you to
go now

Well Im goin aint I I was only just sayin

Say it when you come back And if Mr Carver asks you why I sent that
envelope to him be sure and give him the message I gave you Do you
remember it

Sartin That what you done want wuth so much

Not exactly That what I saved wasnt worth it

All right Ill remember But what did you save Ros Dorindy says
twas somethin you found afloat in the bay If it was somethin
belongin to them Coltons Id have took the money no matter what the
thing was wuth They can afford to pay and if I was you Id take the
reward

I have my reward Now go

I had my reward and I believed it worth much more than five dollars
I had learned my lesson I knew now exactly how I was regarded by the
occupants of the big house and by the townspeople as well I should
cherish no more illusions as to my importance in their eyes I meant to
be really independent from that time on I did not carereally did not
carefor anything or anybody outside my immediate household I was back
in the position I had occupied for years but with one difference I had
an ambition now It was to make both sides in the Shore Lane controversy
realize that George Taylor was right when he said I had the whiphand
By the Almighty they should dance when I cracked that whip

My first opportunity to crack it came a day or two later when Captain
Dean called upon me He had a definite proposition to make although
his Yankee shrewdness and caution prevented his making it until he had
discussed the weather and other unimportant trifles Then he leaned
against the edge of my workbenchwe were in the boathouseand began
to beat up to windward of his proposal

Ros he said you remember I told you you was all right when I met
you at the bank tother day

I remember I answered

Yes Well I callate you know what I meant by that

I did not pretend ignorance of his meaning

I presume I replied that you meant I was right in not selling that
strip of land to Mr Colton

Thats what I meant You kept your promise to me and I shant forget
it Nor the town wont forget it neither Would you mind tellin me
just what happened between you and His Majesty

Not at all He said he wanted to buy the Shore Lane strip and I refused
to sell it to him He said I was crazy and an infernal robber and I told
him to go to the devil

WHAT you didnt

I did

Captain Jed slapped his knee and shouted in delight He insisted on
shaking hands with me

By the great and everlastin he declared between laughs youre
all right Ros Paine I said you was and now Ill swear to it Told old
Colton to go to the devil If that aintoh I wish Id been there

I went on sandpapering a valve plug He walked up and down the floor
chuckling

Well he said at last youve made yourself solid in Denboro
anyhow And I told you you shouldnt lose nothin by it The Selectmen
held a meetin last night and they feel same as me that that Shore
Lane shant be shut off You understand what that means to you dont
you

I looked at him coolly

No I answered

You dont It means the towns decided to buy that strip of land of
yours Definitely decided practically speakin Now whatll you sell it
to us for

I put down the valve plug Captain said I that land is not for
sale

Not for SALE What do you mean by that

I mean that I have decided not to sell it for the present at least
Neither to Colton nor any one else

He could not believe it Of course I would not sell it to Colton Colton
was a stuckup selfish city aristocrat who thought all creation ought
to belong to him But the town was different Did I realize that it was
the town I lived in that was asking to buy now The town of which I was
a citizen Think of what the town had done for me

Very well I answered Im willing to think What has it done for
me

It hadit hadwell it had done a whole lot As a citizen of that town
I owed it aa

Look here Captain Dean I interrupted theres no use in our arguing
the matter I have decided not to sell

Dont talk so foolish Course youll sell if you get money enough

So Colton said but I shant

Ros I aint got any authority to do it but I shouldnt wonder if I
could get you three hundred dollars for that strip

It isnt a question of price

Rubbish Anythings a question of price

This isnt If it was I probably should have accepted Mr Coltons
offer of six hundred and fifty

Six hun Do you mean to say he offered you six hundred and fifty
dollars for that little mite of land and you never took him up

Yes

Well you must be a    Humph Six hundred and fifty The town cant
meet no such bid as that of course

I dont expect it to

He regarded me in silence He was chagrined and angry his florid face
was redder than ever but more than all he was puzzled

Well he observed after a moment this beats me this does Last
time we talked you was willin to consider sellin Whats changed you
Whats the reason you wont sell What business reason have you got for
not doin it

I had no business reason at all Except for Mothers counsel not to
sell which was based upon sentiment and nothing else and my own
stubbornness I had no reason at all Yet I was if anything more firm
in my resolve

How about the Lane he demanded You know what that Lane means to
Denboro

I know what you say it means The townspeople can continue to use the
Lane just as they always have so long as they behave themselves There
is no use of our talking further Captain Ive made up my mind

He went away soon after but he asked another question

Will you do this much for me he asked Will you promise me not to
sell the land to Colton

No I said I will make no promise of any kind to anybody

Oh with a scornful sniff I see Im on to you Youre just hangin
out for a big price I might have known it Youre on Coltons side
after all

I rose I was angry now

I told you price had nothing to do with it I said sharply I am on
no ones side The town is welcome to use the Lane that I have told you
already There is nothing more to be said

He shook his head

I dont make many mistakes he observed slowly but I guess Ive
made one Youre a whole lot deepern I thought you was

So much for the proletariat I heard from the plutocrats next day
Sim Eldredge dropped in on me After much wriggling about the bush he
intimated that he knew of Captain Jedediahs call and what had taken
place

You done just right Ros he whispered He had a habit of whispering
as the Captain had of shouting You done just right Keep em guessin
keep em guessin Jeds all upsot He dont know whether hes keel down
or on his beam ends Hell be makin a higher bid pretty soon Say
with a wink I see Colton last night

Did you

Yup Oh I give him a jolt I hinted that the town had made you a fine
offer and you was considerin it

What did you do that for Who gave you the right to

Sshh Dont holler Somebody might be listenin I come through the
woods and round the beach sos I wouldnt be seen What do you spose
Colton said

I dont care what he said

You will when I tell you He as much as offered a thousand dollars for
that land My crimps a thousand think of that I presume likely you
wouldnt take that would you Ros

Sim Ill tell you as I told Captain Jed that land is not for sale

I tried to make that statement firm and sharp enough to penetrate even
his wooden head but he merely winked again

All right he whispered hastily all right I guess perhaps youre
correct in hangin on Still a thousand is a lot of money even after
you take out my little commission But you know best You put your trust
in me Ill keep her jumpin I understand Goodby

He went out hurriedly and though I shouted after him he only waved
and ducked behind a beachplum bush He did not believe me serious in
my refusal to sell neither did Dean or Colton or apparently any one
else They all thought me merely shrewd a sharp trader driving a hard
bargain as they would have done in my place They might think so if
they wished I should not explain As a matter of fact I could not have
explained my attitude even to myself

Yet this very attitude made a difference a perceptible difference in
my position in Denboro I noticed it each time I went up to the village
I saw the groups at the postoffice and at the depot turn to watch me
as I approached and as I went away Captain Jedediah did not mention the
Lane againat least for some timebut he always hailed me cordially
when we met and seemed anxious to be seen in my company Eldredge of
course was effusive so was Alvin Baker And other people citizens of
consequence in the town who had heretofore merely bowed now stopped
to speak with me on the street Members of the sewing circle called
on Mother more frequently and Matilda Dean Captain Jeds wife came
regularly once a week Sometimes she saw Mother and sometimes she did
not depending upon Dorindas state of mind at the time

Lute always a sort of social barometer noticed the change in the
weather

Everybodys talkin about you Ros he declared They callate youre
a pretty smart feller They dont just understand what youre up to but
they think youre pretty smart

No I commented ironically Lute you astonish me Why am I smart

Well they dont know exactly but they callate you must be Oh
I hear things Capn Jed said tother night youd make a pretty good
Selectman

_I_ would A Selectman

Yup He as much as hinted that to me wondered if youd take the
nomination provided he could fix it for you Sim Eldredge and Alvin and
some more all said theyd vote for you if they got a chance ARE you
figgerin to charge toll on the Lane

Toll What put that idea in your head

Nothin only some of the fellers wondered if you was You see you
wont sell and so

I see Thats a brilliant suggestion Lute When I adopt it Ill
appoint you tollkeeper

By time I wish you would Id make Thoph Newcomb pay up He owes me
ten cents bet it one time and never settled

Yes my position in Denboro had changed But I took no pride in the
change as I had at first I knew the reason for this sudden burst of
popularity The knowledge made me more cynical than evercynical and
lonely For the first time since I came to the Cape I longed for a real
friend not a relative or an acquaintance but a friend to trust and
confide in Some one with no string of his own to pull who cared for
me because I was myself

And all the time I had such a friend and did not realize it The
knowledge came to me in this way Mother had one of her seizures one
of the now infrequent sinking spells as the doctor called them on an
evening when I was alone with her Dorinda and Lute had gone with the
horse and buggy to visit a cousin in Bayport They were to stay over
night and return before breakfast the next morning

I was alone in the diningroom when Mother called my name There was
something in her tone which alarmed me and I hastened to her bedside
One glance at her face was enough

Boy she said weakly I am afraid I am going to be ill I have tried
not to alarm you but I feel faint and I amyou wont be alarmed will
you I know it is nothing serious

I told her not to worry and not to talk I hurried out to the kitchen
got the hot water and the brandy made her swallow a little of
the mixture and bathed her forehead and wrists with vinegar an
oldfashioned restorative which Dorinda always used She said she felt
better but I was anxious and as soon as it was safe to leave her
hurried out to bring the doctor She begged me not to go because it
was beginning to rain and I might get wet but I assured her it was not
raining hard and went

It was not raining hard when I started but there was every sign of
a severe storm close at hand It was pitch dark and I was weary from
stumbling through the bushes and over the rough path when I reached the
corner of the Lane and the Lower Road Then a carriage came down that
road It was an open wagon and George Taylor was the driver He had been
up to the Deans and was on his way home

I hailed the vehicle intending to ask for a ride but when Taylor
discovered who his hailer was he insisted on my going back to the house
He would get the doctor he said and bring him down at once I was
afraid he would be caught in the storm and hesitated in accepting the
offer but he insisted I did go back to the house found Mother in much
the same condition as when I left her and had scarcely gotten into the
kitchen again when Taylor once more appeared

I brought Nellie along to stay with your mother he said The Capn
and the old ladymeaning Matildawere up at the meetinghouse and we
just left a note saying where wed gone Nellies all right Between you
and me she dont talk you deaf dumb and blind like her ma and shes
good company for sick folks Now Ill fetch the doctor and be right
back

But its raining pitchforks I said Youll be wet through

No I wont Ill have Doc Quimby here in no time

He drove off and Nellie Dean went into Mothers room I had always
considered Nellie a milkandwatery young female but somehow her quiet
ways and soft voice seemed just what were needed in a sick room I left
the two together and came out to wait for Taylor and the doctor

But they did not come The storm was under full headway now and the
wind was dashing the rain in sheets against the windows I waited nearly
an hour and still no sign of the doctor

Nellie came out of Mothers room and closed the door softly behind her

Shes quiet now she whispered I think shes asleep Where do you
suppose George is

Goodness knows I answered I shouldnt have let him go a night like
this

Im afraid you couldnt stop him if his mind was made up Hes dreadful
determined when he sets out to be

Hes a good fellow I said to please her She worshipped the cashier
a fact of which all Denboro was aware and which caused gossip to report
that she did the courting for the two

She blushed and smiled

He thinks a lot of you she observed Hes always talking to me about
you Its a good thing youre a man or I should be jealous

I smiled I seem to be talked about generally just now said I

Are you Oh you mean about the Shore Lane Yes Pa cant make you out
about that He says youve got something up your sleeve and he hasnt
decided what it is I asked George what Pa meant and he just laughed He
said whatever you had in your sleeve was your affair and if he was any
judge of character it would stay there till you got ready to shake it
out He always stood up for you even before the Shore Lane business
happened I think he likes you better than any one else in Denboro

Present company excepted of course

Oh of course If that wasnt excepted I should REALLY be jealous
Then more seriously Roscoe does it seem to you that George is
worried or troubled about something lately

I thought of Taylors sudden change of expression that day in the bank
and of his remark that he wished he had my chance But I concealed my
thoughts

The prospect of marriage is enough to make any man worried isnt it
I asked I imagine he realizes that he isnt good enough for you

There was sarcasm in this remark sarcasm of which I should have been
ashamed But she took it literally and as a compliment She looked at me
reproachfully

Good enough for me she exclaimed He Sometimes I wonder if it is
right for me to be so happy I feel almost as if it was wrong As if
something must happen to punish me for it

I did not answer To tell the truth I was envious There was real
happiness in the world This country girl had found it that Mabel
Colton would no doubt find it some dayunless she married her Victor
in which case I had my doubts But what happiness was in store for me

Nellie did most of the talking thereafter principally about George and
why he did not come At last she went in to see if Mother needed her
and twenty minutes later when I looked into the bedroom I saw that
she had fallen asleep on the couch Mother too seemed to be sleeping
and I left them thus

It was almost eleven oclock when the sound of carriage wheels in the
yard brought me to the window and then to the door Doctor Quimby had
come at last and Taylor was with him The doctor in his mackintosh and
overshoes was dry enough but his companion was wet to the skin

Sorry Im so late Ros said the doctor I was way up to Ebenezer
Cahoons in West Denboro Theres a new edition of Ebenezer made port
this morning and I was a little bit concerned about the missus Shes
all right though Hows your mother

Better I think Shes asleep now So is Nellie I suppose George told
you she was with her

Yes George had a rough passage over that West Denboro road Its bad
enough in daylight but on a night like thiswhew I carried away a
wheel turning into Ebenezers yard and if George hadnt had his team
along I dont know how Id have got here Ill go right in and see Mrs
Paine

He left us and I turned to Taylor

Youre soaked through I declared Come out to the kitchen stove
What in the world made you drive way up to that forsaken place Its a
good seven miles Come out to the kitchen Quick

He sat down by the stove and put his wet boots on the hearth I mixed
him a glass of the brandy and hot water and handed him a cigar

Why did you do it George I said I never would have thought of
asking such a thing

I know it he said Course you wouldnt ask it Theres plenty in
this town that would but you wouldnt Maybe thats one reason I was so
glad to do it for you

I am almost sorry you did It is too great a kindness altogether Im
afraid I shouldnt have done as much for you

Go on Yes you would I know you

I shook my head

No you dont I answered Captain Jedyour prospective
fatherinlawsaid the other day that he had been mistaken he thought
he knew me but he was beginning to find he did not

Did he say that What did he mean

I imagine he meant he wasnt sure whether I was the fool he had
believed me to be or just a sharp rascal

Taylor looked at me over the edge of his glass

You think thats what he meant do you

I know it

He put the glass on the floor beside him and laid a hand on my knee

Ros he said I dont know for sure what the Capn meant though
if he thinks youre either one of the two hes the fool But _I_ know
youbetter maybe than you know yourself At least I believe I know
you better than any one else in the town

That wouldnt be saying much

Wouldnt it Well maybe not But whose fault is it Its yours the
way I look at it Ros Ive been meaning to have a talk with you some
day perhaps this is as good a time as any You make a big mistake in
the way you treat Denboro and the folks in it

What do you mean

I mean just that Your whole attitude is wrong has been wrong ever
since you first came here to live You never gave any of us a chance to
know you and like youanybody but me I mean and even I never had
but half a chance You make a mistake I tell you Theres lots of good
folks in this town lots of em Capn Elisha Warrens one of em and
theres plenty more Theyre countrymen same as I am but theyre good
plain sensible folks and theyd like to like you if they had a chance
You belong to the Town Improvement Society but you never go to a
meeting You ought to get out and mix more

I shrugged my shoulders I guess my mixing wouldnt be very welcome I
said And besides I dont care to mix

I know you dont but you ought to just the same

Nonsense George Im not blind or deaf Dont you suppose I know what
Warren and Dean and the rest think of me They consider me a loafer and
no good Ive heard what they say Ive noticed how they treat me

How you treat them you mean You are as cold and freezing as a cake
of ice They was willing to be friends but you wouldnt have it And
as for their calling you a loaferwell thats your own fault too
You OUGHT to do something not work perhaps but youd be a whole lot
better off if you got really interested in something Get into politics
get into town affairs get out and know the people youre living with

I dont care to know them and Im sure they dont care to know me

Yes they do I understand how you feel In this Shore Lane matter now
you think Capn Jed and Colton because they pretend to call you a fool
dont respect you for taking the stand you have They do They dont
understand you maybe but they cant help respecting you and if they
knew you even as well as I do theyd like you Come I aint throwin
any bouquets but why do you suppose Id be willing to drive to West
Denboro forty times over on forty times worse nights than this for
you Why

Heaven knows Would you

I would I like you Ros I took a shine to you the first time I met
you I dont know why exactly Why does anybody like anybody else But I
think a whole lot of you I know this sounds foolish and you dont feel
that way towards me but its the truth

I was amazed I had always liked George Taylor but I never felt any
strong affection for him I was a little less indifferent to him than to
others in Denboro that was all And I had taken it for granted that
his liking for me was of the same casual lukewarm variety To hear him
declare himself in this way was astonishinghe the dry keen Yankee
banker

But why George I repeated

I dont know why I told you that Its because I cant help it I
suppose Or because as I said I know you better than any one else

I sighed Nobody knows me here I said

One knows you Ros I know you

You may think you do but you dont You can thank God for your
ignorance

Maybe I aint so ignorant

I looked at him He was looking me straight in the eye

What do you know I asked slowly

I know for one thing that your name aint Paine

I could not answer I am not certain whether I attempted to speak or
move I do remember that the pressure of his hand on my knee tightened

Its all right Ros he said earnestly Nobody knows but me and
nobody ever shall know if I can help it

Howhow much do you know I stammered

Why pretty much all I guess Ive known ever since your mother was
taken sick Some things I read in the paper and the pictures ofof
your father put me on and afterwards I got more certain of it But
its all right Nobody but me knows or shall know

I leaned my head on my hand He patted my knee gently

Areare you sure no one else knows I asked

Certain sure There was one time when it might have all come out A
reporter fellow from one of the Boston papers got on the track somehow
and came down here to investigate Luckily I was the first man he
tackled and I steered him away I presume likely I lied some but my
conscience is easy so far as that goes

And you have told no one Not even Nellie

No I tell Nellie most things but not allnot all

I remembered afterwards that he sighed as he said this and took his
hand from my knee but then my agitation was too great to do more than
casually notice it I rose to my feet

George George I cried II cant say to you what I should like
But whyWHY did you shield me And lie for me Why did you do it I was
hardly more than a stranger

He sighed Dont know he answered I never could quite see why
a mans sins should be visited on the widows and fatherless And of
course I realized that you and your mother changed your name and came
down here to get away from gossip and talk But I guess the real reason
was that I liked you Ros Love at first sight same as we read about
hey

He looked up and smiled I seized his hand

George I said chokingly I did not believe I had a real friend in
the world except Mother and Dorinda and Lute of course I cant
thank you enough for shielding us all these years theres no use in my
trying But if ever I can do anything to help YOUanythingIll do it
Ill swear to that

He shook my hand

I know you will Ros he said I told you I knew you

If ever I can do anything

He interrupted me

Theres one thing you can do right now he said Thats get out and
mix Thatll please me as much as anything And begin right off Why
see here the Methodist society is going to give a strawberry festival
on the meetinghouse lawn next Thursday night About everybodys going
Nellie and I included You come will you

I hesitated I had heard about the festival but I certainly had not
contemplated attending

Come he urged You wont say no to the first favor I ask you
Promise me youll be on hand

Before I could answer we heard the door of Mothers room open George
and I hastened into the diningroom Doctor Quimby and Nellie Dean were
there Nellie rushed over to her lovers side

You bad boy she cried Youre wet through

Doctor Quimby turned to me

Your mas getting on all right he declared About all that ails her
now is that she wants to see you

George was assisting Nellie to put on her wraps

Got to leave you now Ros he said Capn Jed and Matildyll think
weve eloped ahead of time Goodnight Oh say will you promise me to
take in the strawberry festival

Why I answered I supposeYes Mother Im comingWhy yes George
Ill promise to please you

I have often wondered since what my life story would have been if I had
not made that promise



CHAPTER VIII


The Methodist church stood on the slope of a little hill back from the
Main Road and the parsonage was next door Between the church and
the parsonage was a stretch of lawn dotted with shrubs and cedars
and shaded by two big silverleaf poplars It was on this lawn that
provided the night was fair the strawberry festival was to be held If
the weather should be unpropitious the festival was to be in the church
vestry

All that day Dorinda was busy baking and icing cake She was not going
to the festivalpartly because I was going and she could not leave
Motherbut principally because such affairs were altogether too
frivolous to fit in her scheme of orthodoxy I dont recollect she
said that the apostles did much strawberry festivalin they had
other things to attend to Lute however was going and if he had been
invited to a Presidential reception he could not have been much more
excited He was dressed and ready at supper time although the festival
did not begin until seventhirty

Think Im all right Dorindy do you he queried anxiously turning
himself about for his wifes inspection How about these new pants Fur
enough down on my boots be they

Dorinda looked him over with a critical eye Umhm she observed
that end of em seems to be all right But I callate the upper end
aint been introduced to your vest yet Anyhow the two dont seem to be
well enough acquainted to associate close

Lute bent forward to inspect the hiatus between trousers and waistcoat
By time he exclaimed I told Sim Eldredge they was too short in the
waist He said if they was any longer theyd wrinkle under the arms I
dont know what to do If I hist em up theyll be what the fellers call
highwater wont them

Humph Id ruther have em highwater than shoal in the middle of the
channel Youll have to average up somehow I ought to have known better
than to trust you to buy anything all by yourself

She condescended to approve of my appearance when an hour later I came
downstairs garbed in my best

Humph she vouchsafed after a long look I declare Id hardly know
you Roscoe You look more as you used to when you fust come here to
live

Thanks I answered drily Im glad to see that you respect old age
This suit is venerable enough to command that kind of respect

Taint the suit though thats all right enough Its the way you wear
it I guess You look BETTER than you used to Youre browned up
and broadened out and its real becomin But she added with
characteristic caution you must remember that good looks dont count
for much My father used to say to me that handsome is that handsome
does Not that I was so homely Id scare the crows but he didnt want
me to be vain Now dont fall overboard in THAT suit will you

Mother noticed my unwonted grandeur when I went in to say goodnight to
her

Why Roscoe she exclaimed You must consider this strawberry
festival very important

Why Mother

Because youve taken such pains to dress for it

It did not require a great deal of pains I merely put on what Dorinda
calls my Sunday clothes I dont know why I did either I certainly
dont consider the festival important

I am glad you did I have been a little troubled about you of late
Boy It has seemed to me that you were growingwell not careless
exactly but indifferent As if you were losing interest in life I
dont blame you Compelled to waste your time here in the country a
companion to a bedridden old woman like me

Hush Mother Youre not old and as to wasting my timewhy Mother
you know

Yes yes Boy I know what you would say But it does trouble me
nevertheless I ought to bid you go back into the world and take your
place among men A hundred times I have been upon the point of telling
you to leave me butbutI am SO selfish

Hush Mother please

Yes I AM selfish and I know it I am growing stronger every day I
am sure of it Just a little longer Roscoe just a little longer and
then

Mother I

There there she stroked my hand We wont be sad will we It
pleases me to see you taking an interest in affairs I think this Shore
Lane matter may be a good thing after all Dorinda says that Luther
tells her you are becoming very popular in town because of your
independent stand Everyone recognizes your public spirit

Did she tell you that

Not in those words You know Dorinda But what amounts to that I am
sure the Denboro people are very proud of you

I thought of my popularity and the admiration of my public spirit
as manifested in the attentions of Captain Jed and Eldredge and their
followers and I turned my head away so that she might not see my face

And I am glad you are going to the strawberry festival I cant
remember when you attended such a function before Boy

Yes Mother

There isnt any reason any special reason for your going is there

Why what do you mean

I meanwell you are young and I did not know but perhaps some one
else was going some one you were interested in andand

I laughed aloud Mother I said reproachfully

Why not I am very proud of my handsome boy and I know that

There there I havent noticed that my beauty is so fascinating as
to be dangerous No Mother there is no special reason for my going
tonight I promised George Taylor that was all

Well I am sure you will have a good time Kiss me Boy Goodnight

I was by no means so sure of the good time In fact I loitered on my
way to the village and it was well past eight oclock when I paid my
fifteen cents admission fee to Elnathan Mullet at the gate of the church
grounds and sauntered up the slope toward the lights and gaiety of the
strawberry festival

The ladies of the Methodist society under whose management the affair
was given were fortunate in their choice of an evening The early risen
moon shone from a cloudless sky and there was so little breeze that the
Japanese lanterns hung above the tables went out only occasionally
The beauty and elite of Denborosee next weeks Cape Cod Itemwere
present in force and mingling with them or if not mingling at least
inspecting them with interest were some of the early arrivals among the
cottagers from South Denboro and Bayport I saw Lute proudly conscious
of his new lavender trousers in conversation with Matilda Dean and
I wondered who was the winner in that wordy race Captain Jedediah
strutted arm in arm with the minister Thoph Newcomb and Alvin Baker
were there with their wives Simeon Eldredge had not yet put in an
appearance but I knew that he would as soon as the evening mail was
sorted

I found Nellie Dean in charge of a table and George Taylor seated at
that table I walked over and joined them

Good evening Nellie said I Well George here I am you see

He shook my hand heartily I see you are he said Good boy How does
it seem to splash into society

I havent splashed yet I have only just arrived

Oh trying the feel of the water hey Guess you wont find it very
chilly As a preparatory tonic Id recommend strawberries and cream
Nellie get Ros a saucer of those genuine homeraised berries why dont
you

Nellie laughed Roscoe she said isnt he dreadful He knows we
bought these berries in Boston Its much too early for the native ones
But they really are very nice though he does make such fun of them

She went into the vestry to get the berries and I sat down at the table
beside Taylor and looked about me

Most everybodys here he observed And theyll be glad to see you
Ros Get out and shake hands and be sociable after youve done your
duty by the fruit How are things at home

Mother is herself again I am glad to say George I have scarcely
thought of anything except what you told me the other night

Then its time you did Thats one reason why I wanted you to come
here Youve been thinking too much about yourself

It isnt of myself but of Mother If you had dropped a hint when that
Boston reporter came

Now look here Ros would YOU have dropped hints if things had been
the other way around

I dont know

I know you wouldnt Whats the use of giving the Denboro gossip mill
a chance to run over time Great heavens it works twelve hours a day as
tis

It was mighty good of you just the same

No it wasnt The whole affair was your business and nobody elses

Well as I said before if ever I have an opportunity to do as much for
younot that I ever will

How do you know you wont Anybodys liable to be gossiped about some
time or other

Not you You are Denboros shining light The mothers and fathers here
point you out as an example of what industry and ambition and honest
effort may rise to I

Shut up He said it almost savagely There he added quickly
lets change the subject Talk about something worth while Humph I
guess they must be opening another crate of those Boston homegrowns
judgin by the time it takes Nellie to get your sample

I am in no hurry How are affairs at the bank

Oh so so Dont know a good man who wants a job do you Henry
Smalls going to leave the middle of next month

Small the bookkeeper Why

Got a better chance up to the city I dont blame him Dont tell
anybody yet its a secret Say Ros DO you know of a good sharp
experienced fellow

I smiled Is it likely I asked How large is my acquaintance among
sharp experienced fellows down here

Not so large as it ought to be Ill give in to that But you know
one

Do I indeed Who is he

Yourself You wouldnt take Smalls job would you

I I laughed aloud

Its no joke Youve had a lot of banking experience Ive heard about
it among my city friends who dont know I know you Course I realize
the place is way beneath what you ought to have but

Oh dont be sarcastic No thank you George

All right if you say so But I meant it You dont need the salary I
know ButRos do you mind if I talk plain for a moment

I wondered what was coming now No I answered Go ahead and talk

Well then I tell you as a friend that twould be a good thing for
you if you did take that job or some other one Dont make much matter
what it is but you ought to do something Youre too clever a fellow to
be hanging around shooting and fishing Youre wasting your life

That was wasted long ago

No it wasnt But it will be if you dont change pretty soon I tell
you you ought to get interested in something that counts You might make
a big name for yourself yet

Thats enough of that I have a name already You know it and you know
what was made of it

YOU didnt make it that kind of a name did you And youre young
enough to make it something altogether different You ought to You owe
it to your mother and you owe it to yourself As it is if you keep on
youll

George youve said enough No one but you would have been permitted to
say as much You dont understand

Maybe not but Ros I dont like to have people around here call
you

I dont care a continental what they call me I dont want them to know
who I am but for public opinion generally I care nothing

He leaned back in his chair His face was in shadow and I could not see
it but his tone was grave enough

You think you dont he said slowly but there may come a time when
you will There may come a time when you get so interested in something
or some person that the thought of what folks would say ifif anything
went wrong would keep you awake night after night Oh I tell you
RosHello Nellie thought youd gone South to pick those berries
yourself Two saucers full Well I suppose I must eat the other to save
itunless Ros here wants both

I said one would be quite sufficient for the present and we three
chatted until Mrs Dean came over and monopolized the chat

Dont go Roscoe protested the matron The Capns here and hell
want to talk to you Hes dreadful interested in you just now Dont
talk about nobody else scurcely You set still and Ill go fetch him

But I refused to set I knew the cause of Captain Jedediahs interest
and what he wished to talk about I rose and announced that I would
stroll about a bit Taylor spoke to me as I was leaving

Ros he said earnestly you think of what I told you will you

I saw a group of people hurrying toward the entrance of the grounds
and I followed them curious as to the cause of the excitement An
automobile had stopped by the gate Sim Eldredge came hastening up and
seized me by the arm

Gosh its Ros he exclaimed in his mysterious whisper I hadnt
seen you afore just got here myself But Im glad you ARE here Ill
see that you and him get a chance to talk private

Who I asked trying to pull my arm free

Why Mr Colton Didnt you know Yes sir thats his car Hes come
and sos his daughter and that young Carver feller I believe theyve
come to take in the sociable There they be See em See em

I saw them Colton and Victor had already alighted and Miss Colton was
descending from the tonneau There were two other men in the car beside
Oscar the chauffeur

Who are those other people I asked

I dont know whispered Sim excitedly Stay where you be and Ill
find out Ill be right back now Dont you move

I did not move not because he had ordered me to stay where I was but
because I was curious The spot where I stood was in shadow and I knew
they could not see me

Colton and his daughter were talking with Victor who remained by the
step of the auto

Well Mabel observed Big Jim here we are though why I dont
know I hope you enjoy this thing more than I am likely to

Of course I shall enjoy it Father Look at the decorations Arent
they perfectly WONDERFUL

Especially the color scheme drawled Victor Mabel I call your
attention to the red blue and purple lanterns Some class Yes Well
I must go Ill be back in a very short time If Parker wasnt starting
for Europe tomorrow I shouldnt think of leaving but Im sure youll
forgive me under the circumstances

I forgive you Victor replied the girl carelessly But dont be too
long

No dont added her father I promised Mrs Colton that I should not
be away more than an hour Shes very nervous tonight and I may be sent
for any time So dont keep us waiting

No fear of that Ill be back long before you are ready to go I
wouldnt miss thiseraffair myself for something Ah our combination
friend the undertaking postmaster

Sims hat was in his hand and he was greeting Mr Colton

Proud to see you amongst us sir said Sim with unction The
Methodist folks are havin quite a time tonight aint they

How dye do Eldredge was the great mans salutation not at all
effusive Where does all this crowd come from Didnt know there were
so many people in the neighborhood

Most everybodys out tonight Churchll make considerble money Good
evenin Miss Colton Mr Carver pleased to meet you again sir

The young lady merely nodded Victor whose foot was on the step of the
car did not deign to turn

Thanks he drawled I amerembalmed Im sure All ready Phil
Let her go Oscar

The auto moved off Mr Colton gave his arm to his daughter and they
moved through the crowd Eldredge acting as master of ceremonies

Its all right Elnathan ordered Sim addressing the gatekeeper
Dont bother Mr Colton about the admission now Ill settle with you
myself later Now Mr Colton you and the lady come right along with
me Aint met the minister yet have you He said you want to home when
he called And you let me get you some strawberries Theyre fustrate
if I do say it

He led the way toward the tables I watched the progress from where I
stood It was interesting to see how the visitors were treated by the
different groups Some like Sim were gushing and obsequious A few
Captain Jed among them walked stubbornly by either nodding coldly or
paying no attention Others like George Taylor and Doctor Quimby were
neither obsequious nor cold merely bowing pleasantly and saying Good
evening as though greeting acquaintances and equals Yes there WERE
good people in Denboro quiet unassuming selfrespecting citizens

One of them came up to me and spoke

Hello Ros said Captain Elisha Warren Sims havin the time of his
life isnt he

He seems to be I replied

Yes Well theres some satisfaction in havin a thick shell then
you dont mind bein stepped on Yet I dont know sometimes I think
fellers of Sims kind enjoy bein stepped on provided the boot that
does it is patent leather

I wonder why they came here I mused

Who the Coltons Why for the same reason children go to the circus
I shouldnt wonderto laugh at the clowns I laugh myself
sometimesthough taint always at their kind of clowns Speakin of
that young Carvers in good company this evenin aint he

Who were those fellows in the auto I asked

Didnt you recognize them One was Phil Somersson of the rich widow
who owns the big cottage at Harniss Tother is a bird of the same flock
down visitin em Carvers takin em over to Ostable to say goodby to
another specimen a college mate who is migratin to Europe tomorrow
The chauffeur told Dan my man about it this afternoon The chauffeur
figgered that knowin the crowd twas likely to be a lively farewell
Hello theres Abbie hailin me See you later Ros

I knew young Somers by reputation He and his friends were a wild set
if report was true

Eldredge had hinted that he intended arranging an interview between
Colton and myself The prospect did not appeal to me At first I decided
to go home at once but something akin to Captain Deans resentful
stubbornness came over me I would not be driven home by those people
I found an unoccupied camp chairone of Sims which he rented for
funeralsand carried it to a dark spot in the shrubbery near the border
of the parsonage lawn and not far from the gate There I seated myself
lit a cigar and smoked in solitude

Elnathan Mullet evidently considering his labors as doorkeeper over
was counting his takings by lantern light The moon was low in the west
and a little breeze was now stirring the shrubbery It was very warm for
the season and I mentally prophesied thunder showers before morning

I had smoked my cigar perhaps half through when a carriage came down the
road and stopped before the gate The driver leaned forward and called
to Mullet

Hi Uncle he shouted You by the gate Is Mr Colton here

Elnathan who was apparently half asleep looked up

Hey he queried Mr Colton Yes hes here Want him do you

Yes Where is he

Up yonder somewheres There he is by Sarah Burgesss table Mr
Colton Mr Colton Somebody wants ye

What in blazes did you yell like that for protested the coachman
springing from the carriage Stop it dye hear

You said you wanted him didnt you Mr Colton Hi Come here

Colton came hurrying down to the gate his daughter following more
slowly

Whats the matter he asked

The coachman touched his hat

I beg your pardon sir he said this man started yelling before I
could stop him I was coming to tell you Mrs Colton says shes very
nervous sir and please come home at once

Colton turned with a shrug to his daughter We might have expected it
Mabel he said Come

But the young lady seemed to hesitate I believe I wont go yet
Father she said Mother doesnt need both of us Victor will be here
very soon and we promised to wait for him you know

We can leave word Youd better come Mabel Heavens and earth you
dont want any MORE of this do you

It was evident that he had had quite enough of the festival She laughed
lightly

Im finding it very entertaining she said I never saw so many
quaint people There is one girl a Miss Dean whom I am really
getting acquainted with Shes as country as can be but shes very
interesting

Humph she must be Dean hey Daughter of my particular friend the
ancient mariner I suppose I dont like to leave you here What shall I
tell your mother

Tell her I am quite safe and in perfectly respectable company

Humph I can imagine how respectable shell think it is Well I know
its useless to urge if you have made up your mind I dont see where
you get your stubbornness from

Dont you I can guess

It isnt from your dad Now do be careful wont you If Victor doesnt
come soon I shall send the carriage

Oh he will come Its all right Father dear I am quite able to take
care of myself

Her father shook his head Yes he observed I guess you are All
right Jenkins

He got into the carriage and was driven off Miss Colton turned and
walked back to the tables I relit my cigar

Another halfhour passed

Mullet finished his counting took up his money box and lantern and left
the gate unguarded Groups of homegoing people began to come down the
hill Horses which had been standing under the church sheds or hitched
in neighboring yards appeared and the various buggies and twoseaters
to which they were attached were filled and driven away Captain Warren
and Miss Abbie Baker his housekeeper were among the first to leave
Abijah Hammond the sexton began taking down the lanterns The
strawberry festival was almost over

I rose from my camp chair and prepared to start for home As I stepped
from behind the shrubbery the moonlight suddenly went out as if it had
been turned off like a gas jet Except for the few remaining lanterns
and the gleams from the church windows and door the darkness was
complete I looked at the western sky It was black and low down along
the horizon flashes of lightning were playing My prophecy of showers
was to be fulfilled

The ladies of the Methodist Society assisted by their husbands and male
friends were hurrying the tables and chairs indoors I picked up and
folded the chair I had been occupying and joined the busy group It was
so dark that faces were almost invisible but I recognized Sim Eldredge
by his voice and George Taylor and I bumped into each other as we
seized the same table

Hello Ros exclaimed the cashier Thought youd gone Going to have
a tempest aint we

Tempest is Cape Cod for thunderstorm I agreed that one was imminent

Hold on till I get this stuff into the vestry continued Taylor and
Ill drive you home Ill be ready pretty soon

I declined the invitation Ill walk I answered You have Nellie
to look after If you have a spare umbrella Ill borrow that Where is
Nellie

Oh shes over yonder with Miss Colton They have been making each
others acquaintance Say Ros shes a good deal of a girl that Colton
one did you know it

I did not answer

Oh I know youre down on the whole lot of em he added laughing
but she is just the same Kind of toplofty and condescending but
thats the fault of her bringingup Shes all right underneath Too
good for that Carver cub By the way if he doesnt come pretty soon
Ill phone her pa to send the carriage for her If I was Colton I
wouldnt put much confidence in Carvers showing up in a hurry You saw
the gang he was with didnt you They dont get home till morning till
daylight doth appear as a usual thing Hello thats the carriage now
aint it Guess papa wasnt taking any chances

Sure enough there were the lights of a carriage at the gate and I
heard the voice of Jenkins the coachman shouting Nellie Dean called
Taylors name and he hurried away A few moments later he returned

Shes off safe and sound he said I judged she wasnt any too well
pleased with her Victor for not showing up to look out for her

A sharp flash of lightning cut the sky and a rattling peal of thunder
followed

Right on top of us aint it exclaimed George Sure you dont want
me to drive you home All right just as you say Hold on till I get you
that umbrella

He borrowed an umbrella from the parsonage I took it thanked him and
hastened out of the church grounds I looked up the road as I passed
through the gate I could have seen an autos lamps for a long distance
but there were none in sight With a malicious chuckle I thought that my
particular friend Victor was not taking the surest way of making himself
popular with his fiancee if that was what she was

The storm overtook me before I was halfway down the Lower Road A few
drops of rain splashed the leaves A lightning stroke so near and
sharp that I fancied I could hear the hiss was accompanied by a savage
thunderclap Then came the roar of wind in the trees by the roadside
and down came the rain I put up my umbrella and began to run We have
few tempests in Denboro those we do have are almost worthy of the
name

I had reached the grove of birches perhaps two hundred yards from the
Shore Lane when out of the wet darkness before me came plunging a horse
drawing a covered carriage I had sprung to one side to let it go by
when I heard a mans voice shouting Whoa The voice did not come from
the carriage but from the road behind it

Whoa Stop him it shouted

I jumped back into the road The horse saw me appear directly in front
of him shied and reared The carriage lamps were lighted and by their
light I saw the reins dragging I seized them and held on It was all
involuntary I was used to horses and this one was frightened that was
all

Whoa boy I ordered Whoa Stand still

The horse had no intention of standing still

He continued to rear and plunge I clinging to the reins found myself
running alongside I had to run to avoid the wheels But I ran as slowly
as I could and my one hundred and ninety pounds made running on the
animals part a much less easy exercise

The voice from the rear continued to shout and in another moment a man
seized the reins beside me Together we managed to pull the horse into a
walk Then the man whom I recognized as the Colton coachman vented
his feelings in a comprehensive burst of profanity I interrupted the
service

What is the matter I asked

Oh this blessedor words to that effecthorse is scared of
thunder thats all Hes a new one we just bought him before we came
down here and I hadnt learned his little tricks Whoa stand still or
Ill break your dumb neck Say turning to me go back will you and
see if shes all right

Who

Miss Coltonthe old mans daughter She got out when he began to dance
and I was holding him by the bridle Then came that big flash and
he broke loose Go back and see to her will you I cant leave this
horse

For just a moment I hesitated I am ashamed of my hesitation now but
this is supposed to be a truthful chronicle Then I went back down the
road By another flash of lightning I saw the ministers umbrella upside
down in the bushes where I had dropped it and I took it with me I was
about as wet as I well could be but I am glad to say I remembered that
the umbrella was a borrowed one

After I had walked or stumbled or waded a little way I stopped and
called

Miss Colton I called Where are you

Here came the answer from just ahead Is that you Jenkins

I did not reply until I reached her side

You are not hurt I asked

No not at all But who is it

I ameryour neighbor Paine is my name

Oh the tone was not enthusiastic Where is Jenkins

He is attending to the horse Pardon me Miss Colton but wont you
take this umbrella

This seemed to strike her as a trifle absurd Why thank you she
said but I am afraid an umbrella would be useless in this storm Is
the horse all right

Yes though he is very much frightened I

I was interrupted by another flash and terrific report from directly
overhead The young lady came closer to me

Oh she exclaimed

I had an idea The flash had made our surroundings as light as day
for an instant and across the road I saw Sylvanus Snows old house
untenanted abandoned and falling to decay I took Miss Coltons arm

Come I said

She hung back Where are you going she asked

Just across the road to that old house On the porch we shall be out of
the rain

She made no further objections and together we stumbled through the
wet grass and over Sylvanuss weedgrown flower beds I presume I shall
never again smell the spicy fragrance of old maids pinks without
thinking of that night

I found the edge of the piazza by the direct process of barking my shins
against it and helped her up on to the creaking boards My sanguine
statement that we should be out of the rain proved not quite true There
was a roof above us but it leaked I unfurled the wet umbrella and held
it over her head

For some moments after we reached the piazza neither of us spoke The
roar of the rain on the shingles of the porch and the splash and gurgle
all about us would have made conversation difficult even if we had
wished to talk I for one did not At last she said

Do you see or hear anything of Jenkins

I listened or tried to I was wondering myself what had become of the
coachman

No I answered I dont hear him

Where do you suppose he is He could not have been far away when you
met him

He was not And I know he intended to come back at once

You dont suppose Caesarthe horseran away again When that second
crack came

I was wondering that very thing That particular thunder clap was louder
and more terrifying than those preceding it However there was no use
in alarming her

I guess not I answered Hell be here soon I am sure

But he did not come The storm seemed to be passing over The flashes
were just as frequent but there was a longer interval between each
flash and its thunder peal The rain was still a steady downpour

Miss Colton was plainly growing more anxious

Where can he be she murmured

Dont be frightened I urged He is all right Ill go and look him
up if you dont mind being left alone

Cantcant we go together

We could of course but there is no use in your getting wetter than
you are If you are willing to stay here I will run up the road and see
if I can find him

Thank you But you will get wet yourself

Oh I am wet already Take the umbrella Ill be back in a minute

I pressed the handle of the umbrella into her handit was as steady as
mineand darted out into the flood I think she called me to come back
but I did not obey I ran up the road until I was some distance beyond
the point where I had stopped the runaway but there were no signs of
horse carriage or coachman I called repeatedly but got no reply
Then reluctantly I gave it up and returned to the porch

She gave a little gasp of relief when I reached her side

Oh she exclaimed did you find him

No I answered He seems to have gone on He cannot have gone far It
is only a little way to the Corners

Isisnt there a house a house with people living in it near this
place

No nearer than your house Miss Colton We seem to have chosen the most
forsaken spot in Denboro to be cast away in I am very sorry

I am not frightened for myself But I know my father and mother will be
alarmed if I dont come soon I am sure Caesar must have run away again
and I am afraid Jenkins must be hurt

I had thought of that too Only an accident could explain the
coachmans nonappearance or at least his not sending help to his
mistress

If you are really not afraid to remain here Miss Colton I said I
will go to your house myself

Oh no Some one will come soon I cant understand where VictorMr
Carvercan be He was to have joined me at the church

I did not answer Knowing Mr Carvers associates and the errand upon
which he had gone I imagined I could guess the cause of his delay But
I did not speak my guess

The storm is not as severe just now I said I can get to your house
in a little while if you are willing I should leave you

She put her hand on my arm Come she said Shall we start now

But you must not go You couldnt get there on foot such a night as
this

Yes I can I mean to Please come

I still hesitated She took her hand from my arm and stepped out into
the rain Are you coming she said

I joined her still protesting We splashed on through the mud and
water she clinging lightly to my arm and I holding the perfectly
useless umbrella over her head The rain was descending steadily and the
sky overhead was just black but along the western horizon as I caught
a glimpse of it between the trees I fancied the blackness was a little
less opaque The storm was passing over sure enough

But before it passed it gave us one goodby salute We had about reached
the point on the Shore Lane where I first met her and Carver in the
auto The shaky bridge over Mullets cranberry brook was just ahead
Then without warning the black night split wide open a jagged streak
of fire shot from heaven to earth and seemed to explode almost in our
faces I was almost knocked off my feet and my fingers tingled as if I
had been holding the handles of an electric battery The umbrella flew
out of my hands and so far as I was concerned vanished utterly I
believe Elnathan picked up the ruin next day but just then I neither
knew nor cared what had become of it I had other things to think of

But for a moment I could not think at all I was conscious of a great
crashing and rustling and splintering directly in front of me and then I
realized that the young lady was no longer clinging to my arm I looked
about and up through the darkness Then down She was lying at my feet

I bent over her

Miss Colton I cried Miss Colton Are you hurt

She neither answered nor moved My brain was still numb from the
electric shock and I had a dazed fear that she might be dead I shook
her gently and she moaned I spoke again and again but she did not
answer nor try to rise The rain was pouring down upon us and I knew
she must not lie there So once more just as I had done in the dingy
but now under quite different circumstances and with entirely different
feelings I stooped and lifted her in my arms

My years of outdoor life in Denboro had had one good effect at least
they had made me strong I carried her with little effort to the bridge
And there I stopped The bridge was blocked covered with a mass of wet
leafy branches and splintered wood The lightning bolt had missed us by
just that much It had overthrown and demolished the big willow tree by
the brook and to get through or over the tangle was impossible

So again history repeated itself I descended the bank at the side of
the bridge and waded through the waters with Mabel Colton in my arms I
staggered up the opposite bank and hurried on She lay quiet her head
against my shoulder Her hat had fallen off and a wet fragrant strand
of her hair brushed my cheek Once I stopped and bent my head to listen
to make sure that she was breathing She was I felt her breath upon my
face Afterwards I remembered all this just then I was merely thankful
that she was alive

I had gone but a little way further when she stirred in my arms and
spoke

What is it she asked What is the matter

Nothing I answered with a sigh of relief It is all right We shall
be there soon

But what is the matter Why are youlet me walk please

You had better stay as you are You are almost home

But why are you carrying me What is the matter

Youyou fainted I think The lightning

Oh yes I remember Did I faint How ridiculous Please let me walk
now I am all right Really I am

But I think

Please I insist

I set her gently on her feet She staggered a little but she was plucky
and after a moment was able to stand and walk though slowly

You are sure you can manage it I asked

Of course But why did I faint I never did such a thing before in my
life

That flash was close to us It struck the big willow by the brook

Did it As near as that

Yes Dont try to talk

But I am all right    I am not hurt at all Are we almost home

Yes Those are the lights of your house ahead there

We moved on more rapidly As we turned in at the Colton walk she said
Why it has stopped raining

It had though I had not noticed it The flash which smashed the willow
had been the accompaniment of what Lute would call the clearingup
shower The storm was really over

We stepped up on the portico of the big house and I rang the bell
The butler opened the door His face as he saw the pair of dripping
bedraggled outcasts before him was worth looking at He was shocked out
of his dignity

Why Why Miss Mabel he stammered with almost human agitation
What

A voice a petulant female voice called from the head of the stairs

Johnson it quavered who is it Mabel is that you

The library door flew open and Mr Colton himself appeared

Eh What he exclaimed By George Mabel where have you been I have
been raising heaven and earth to locate you The phone seems to be out
of order andGreat Scott girl youre wet through Jenkins what
Hey Why it isnt Jenkins

The fact that his daughters escort was not the coachman had just dawned
upon him He stared at me in irate bewilderment Before he could ask
a question or his daughter could speak or explain there came a little
shriek from the stairs a rustle of silken skirts and a plump
whitefaced woman in an elaborate house gown rushed across the hall with
both white arms outstretched

Mabel she cried where HAVE you been You poor child I have been
almost beside myself and

Miss Colton laughingly avoided the rush Take care Mother she
warned I am very wet

Wet Why youre absolutely drenched JenkinsMabel where is Jenkins
And who is thiserperson

I thought it quite time for me to withdraw

Good night Miss Colton I said and stepped toward the door But Big
Jim roared my name

Its thatits Paine he exclaimed Here what does this mean
anyway

I think his daughter was about to explain when there came another
interruption From the driveway sounded the blare of an auto horn
Johnson threw open the door just as the big car whirled up to the porch

Here we are laughed Carver emerging from behind the drawn curtains
of the machine Home again from a foreign shore Come in fellows and
have a drink Weve had water enough for one night Come in

He stumbled as he crossed the sill recovered his balance laughed and
then all at once seemed to become aware of the group in the hall He
looked about him swaying a little as he did so

Ah Mabel he exclaimed genially Got here first didnt you Sorry
I was late but it was all old Parkers fault Wouldnt let us say
goodby But we came some when we did come The bridge is down and we
made Oscar run her right through the water Great exexperience Hello
Why whats matter Whos this What its Reuben isnt it Mabel what
on earth

She paid no attention to him I was at the door when she overtook me

Mr Paine she said I am very grateful for your kindness Both for
what you have done tonight and for your help the other afternoon Thank
you

She held out her hand I took it scarcely knowing that I did so

Thank you she said again I murmured something or other and went
out As I stepped from the porch I heard Victors voice

Well by Jove he exclaimed Mabel

I looked back He was standing by the door She went past him without
replying or even looking at him From the automobile I heard smothered
chuckles and exclamations The butler closed the door

I walked home as fast as I could Dorinda was waiting up for me What
she said when she saw the ruin of my Sunday suit had better not be
repeated She was still saying it when I took my lamp and went up to
bed



CHAPTER IX


The strawberry festival and the tempest were of course the subjects
most discussed at the breakfast table next morning Lute monopolized
the conversation a fact for which I was thankful for it enabled me
to dodge Dorindas questions as to my own adventures I did not care to
talk about the latter My feelings concerning them were curiously mixed
Was I glad or sorry that Fate had chosen me to play once more the role
of rescuer of a young female in distress That my playing of the role
had altered my standing in Mabel Coltons mind I felt reasonably sure
Her words at parting with me rang true She was grateful and she had
shaken hands with me Doubtless she would tell her father the whole
story and he too in common decency would be grateful to me for
helping his daughter But after all did I care for gratitude from
that family And what form would that gratitude take Would Colton
like Victor Carver offer to pay me for my services No hardly that I
thought He was a man of wide experience and if he did offer payment
it would be in some less crude form than a five dollar bill

But I did not want payment in any form I did not want condescension and
patronizing thanks I did not want anythingthat was it Up to now the
occupants of the big house and I had been enemies open and confessed I
had so far as possible kept out of their way and hoped they would keep
out of mine But now the situation was more complicated I did not know
what to expect Of course there was no chance of our becoming friends
The difference in social position as they reckoned it made that too
ridiculous to consider as a possibility even if I wished it which
I distinctly did not But something an interview awkward and
disagreeable for both sides or a patronizing note of thanks was at
the very least certain to follow the happenings of the previous night
I wished I had gone home when the Coltons first came to the festival
I wished I had not promised Taylor that I would attend that festival
I wishedI wished a great many things The thought of young Carvers
public snubbing before his friends was my one unmixed satisfaction I
rather imagined that he was more uncomfortable than I was or could be

Lute crowed vaingloriously over his own good judgment in leaving for
home early

I dont know how twas he declared Somethin seemed to tell me we
was in for a turrible tempest I was settin talkin with Alvin Baker
and eatin my second sasser of berries when

SECOND sasser interrupted Dorinda sharply Whered you get money
for two sassers I gave you thirty cents when you started for that
festival It cost you fifteen to get inside the gate and Matildy Dean
told me the church folks was callatin to charge fifteen for a helpin
of berries and cream And you had two sassers you say Who paid for the
second one

Her husband swallowed half a cup of coffee before replying Then his
reply had nothing to do with the question

I dont know how twas he went on I just had the feelin thats
all Sort of a presentpresentuary I guess come over me I looked up
at the sky and twas gettin black and then I looked to the westard
and I see a flash of lightnin Nothin but heat lightnin says
Alvin Heat lightnin nothin says I I tell you

Who paid for that second sasser of berries repeated his wife
relentlessly

Why now Dorindy

Who paid for em If twas Alvin Baker you ought to be ashamed of
yourself spongin on him for your vittles

Alvin Good land did you ever know him to pay for anything he didnt
have to

Never mind what I know Did you get trusted for em How many times
have I told you

I never got trusted I aint that kind And I didnt sponge em
neither I paid cash right out of my own pocket like a man

You did Umhm I want to know Well thenMAN where did the cash in
that pocket come from

Lute squirmed II he stammered

Where did it come from Answer me

Wellwell Dorindy you seewhen you sent me up to the store tother
day after the brown sugar andand number 50 spool cotton you give me
seventyfive cents You remember you did yourself

Yes and I remember you said there was a hole in your pocket and you
lost the change I aint likely to forget it and I shouldnt think
youd be

I didnt forget By time my ears aint done singin yet But that
shows how reckless you talk to me I never lost that change at all I
found it afterwards in my vest so all your jawin was just for nothin
Ros she ought to beg my pardon hadnt she Hadnt she now

Dorinda saved me the trouble of answering

Umhm she observed dryly Well Ill beg my own pardon instead for
bein so dumb as not to go through your vest myself So THATS where
the other fifteen cents come from I see Well you march out to the
woodpile and chop till I tell you to quit

But Dorindy Ive got one of my dyspepsy spells I dont feel real
good this mornin I told you I didnt

Folks that make pigs of themselves on stolen berries hadnt ought to
feel good Exercise is fine for dyspepsy You march

Lute marched and I marched with him as far as the back yard There I
left him groaning before the woodpile and went down to the boat house

The Comforts overhauling was complete and I had launched her the week
before Now she lay anchored at the edge of the channel For the want
of something more important to do I took down my shot gun and began to
polish its already glittering barrels

Try as I might I could not get the memory of my adventure in the
tempest out of my head I reviewed it from end to end thinking of
many things I might have done which in the light of what followed
would have been better and more sensible If instead of leaving the
coachman I had remained to help him with the frightened horse I should
have been better employed Between us we could have subdued the animal
and Miss Colton might have ridden home I wondered what had become of
Jenkins and the horse I wondered if the girl knew I carried her
through the brook Victor had said the bridge was down she must know
I wondered what she thought of the proceeding probably that splashing
about with young ladies in my arms was a habit of mine

I told myself that I did not care what she thought I resolved to forget
the whole affair and to focus my attention upon cleaning the gun But
I could not forget I waded that brook a dozen times as I sat there
I remembered every detail how still she lay in my arms how white her
face looked as the distant lightning flashes revealed it to me how her
hair brushed my cheek as I bent over her I was using a wad of cotton
waste to polish the gun barrel and I threw it into a corner having the
insane notion that in some way the association of ideas came from that
bunch of waste Itthe wastewas grimy and anything but fragrant as
different from the dark lock which the wind had blown against my face as
anything well could be but the hurry with which I discarded it proves
my imbecility at that time Confound the girl she was a nuisance I
wanted to forget her and her family and the sulphurous personage to
whose care I had once consigned the head of the family apparently took a
characteristic delight in arranging matters so that I could not

The shot gun was at last so spotless that even a pretense of further
cleaning was ridiculous I held it level with my eye and squinted
through the barrels

Dont shoot said a voice from the doorway Ill come down

I lowered the gun turned and looked Big Jim Colton was standing
there cigar in mouth cap on the back of his head and both hands in his
pockets exactly as he had appeared in that same doorway when he and I
first met The expected had happened part of it at least He had come
to see me the disagreeable interview I had foreseen was at hand

He nodded and entered without waiting for an invitation

Morning he said

Good morning said I guardedly I wondered how he would begin the
conversation Our previous meeting had ended almost in a fight We had
been fighting by proxy ever since I was prepared for more trouble
for haughty condescension for perfunctory apology for almost anything
except what happened His next remark might have been addressed to an
acquaintance upon whom he had casually dropped in for a friendly call

Thats a good looking gun youve got there he observed Lets see
it

I was too astonished to answer Lets look at it he repeated holding
out his hand

Mechanically I passed him the gun He examined it as if he was used to
such things broke it snapped it shut tried the locks with his thumb
and handed it back to me

Anything worth shooting around here he asked pulling the armchair
toward him and sitting

I think I did not let him see how astonished I was at his attitude I
tried not to

Why yes I answered in the season Plenty of coots some black duck
and quail and partridge in the woods

That so Peters that carpenter of mine said something of the sort I
remember but I wouldnt believe him under oath I could shoot HIM with
more or less pleasure but there seems to be no open session for his
species Wheres your launch

Out yonder I pointed to the Comfort at her moorings He looked but
made no comment I rose and put the gun in the rack Then I returned to
my chair He swung around in his seat and looked at me

Well he said grimly but with a twinkle in his eye the last time
you and I chatted together you told me to go to the devil

This was quite true and I might have added that I was glad of it But
what would be the use I did not answer at all

I havent gone there yet he continued Came over here instead Got
dry yet

Dry

Yes You were anything but dry when I saw you last night Have many
such cloudbursts as that in these parts

Not many No

I hope not I dont want another until I sell that horse of mine The
chap who stuck me with him is a friend of mine He warranted the beast
perfectly safe for an infant in arms to drive and not afraid of anything
short of an earthquake He is a lovely liar I admire his qualifications
in that respect and hope to trade with him again He bucks the stock
market occasionally

He smiled as he said it There was not the slightest malice in his tone
but if I had been the friend I should have kept clear of stocks for
awhile

What became of the horse I asked

Ran away again Jenkins had just got back into the carriage when
another one of those thunder claps started more trouble The horse ran
four miles more or less and stopped only when the wheels got jammed
between two trees I paid nine hundred dollars for that carriage

And the coachman

Oh he lit on his head fortunately and wasnt hurt Spent half the
night trying to find a phone not out of commission but failed Got home
about four oclock leading the horse Paine

Yes

Of course you know what Ive come here for Im much obliged to you

Thats all right Youre welcome

Maybe I am but I am obliged just the same Not only for the help you
gave Mabelmy daughterlast night but for that business in the bay
the other afternoon

So she had told him the whole story Remembering her last words as I
left her in the hall I had rather imagined she would

That didnt amount to anything I said shortly

Why yes it did It might have amounted to a whole lot I asked Peters
some questions about the tides out here and from what he said I judge
that being stuck on the shoals in a squall might not be altogether a
joke Mabel says you handled the affair mighty well

I did not answer He chuckled

How did young Carver enjoy playing second fiddle he asked From what
Ive seen of him he generally expects to lead the band Happy was he

I remained silent He smiled broadly

He isnt any too happy this morning he went on That young man wont
do I never quoted him within twenty points of par but Mabel seemed to
like him and her mother thought he was the real thing Mrs C couldnt
forget that his family is one of the oldest on the list Personally
I dont gamble much on families know a little about my own and that
little is enough But women are different However family or not he
wont do I should tell him so myself but I guess Mabel will save me
the trouble Shes got a surprising amount of commonsense considering
that shes an only childand who her parents are By the way Paine
what did Carver say when you put him ashore

Hehe saidoh nothing of importance

Yes I know that I listened to his explanations last night But did he
say anything

Why he offered to pay me for my work

Did he How much

I did not wait to find out

And you havent heard from him since

I hesitated

Have you he repeated

Well II received a note from him next day

Humph Offering apologies

No

Sent you money didnt he

I looked at him in surprise Did he tell you I asked

No nobody told me Im only trying to find out whether or not I have
lost all my judgment of human nature since I struck this sand heap He
did send you money then How much

Mr Colton I

Come now How much

Wellhe sent me five dollars

No he didnt

I am telling you the truth

Yes slowly I know you are Ive got that much judgment left Sent
you five dollars did he And you sent it back

Yes

Any message with it

I was tired of being catechized I had not meant to tell him anything
Now I decided to tell him all If it angered him so much the better

I sent him word that what I saved wasnt worth the money

To my amazement he was not angry Instead he slapped his knee and
laughed aloud

Ho ho he shouted Humph Well that was    Id like to have
seen his face when he got that message No that young man wont do He
wont do at all

It was not for me to dispute this conclusion even if I had disagreed
with him which I did not I said nothing He rubbed his knee for a
moment and then changed the subject

How did you happen to be on the Lower Road at that time of the night
he asked Im mighty glad you were there of course but where did you
come from

I left the festival rather late and

Festival Oh that thing up at the church I didnt see you there

I had taken pains that he should not see me

Do you mean to tell me he continued that you enjoy a thing like
that What in blazes made Mabel want to go I dont see She and Carver
were set on going and it would be the treat of a lifetime or words to
that effect I cant see it myself Of all the wooden headed jays I ever
laid eyes on this town holds the finest collection Narrow and stubborn
and blind to their own interests

This was more like what I expected from him and I resented it It may
seem odd that I of all persons should have taken upon myself the
defense of Denboro and its inhabitants but that is what I did

They are no more narrow and stubborn in their way than city people are
in theirs I declared They resent being ordered about as if their
opinions and wishes counted for nothing and I honor them for it

Do hey

Yes I do Mr Colton I tell you that you are all wrong Simply
because a man lives in the country it does not follow that he is a
blockhead No one in Denboro is rich as you would count riches but
plenty of them are independent and ask no help from any one You cant
drive them

Cant I

No you cant And if you want favors from men here you must ask for
them not try to bully

I dont want favors I want to be treated decently thats all When
I came here I intended doing things to help the town I should have
enjoyed doing it I told some of them so Look at the money Ive spent
Look at the taxes Ill pay Why they ought to be glad to have me here
They ought to welcome me

So they would if you had not behaved as if you were what some of them
call youEmperor of New York I tell you Mr Colton youre all
wrong I know the people here

So Well from what Ive been able to learn about you you havent
associated with many of them Youve been playing a little at the high
and mighty yourself

Chickens do come home to roost My attitude of indifference and coldness
toward my fellow citizens had been misinterpreted as it deserved to be
George Taylor was right when he said I had made a mistake

I have been foolish I said hotly but not for the reason you
suppose I dont consider myself any better than the people hereno
nor even the equal of some of them And from what I have seen of you
Mr Colton I dont consider you that either

Even this did not make him angry He looked at me as if I puzzled him

Say Paine he said what in the world are you doing down in a place
like this

What do you mean

Just that You upset my calculations I thought I spotted you and put
you in the class where you belonged when you and I first met I can
usually size up a man Youve got me guessing What are you doing down
here Youre no Rube

If he intended this as a compliment I was not in the mood to accept
it as such I should have told him that what I was or was not was no
business of his But he went on without giving me the opportunity

Youve got me guessing he repeated You talk like a man The way
you looked out for my daughter last night and the way according to her
story you handled her and Victor the other afternoon was a mans job
Why are you wasting your life down here

Mr Colton I dont consider

Never mind Youre right thats your affair of course But I hate to
quit till I have the answer and nobody around here seems to have the
answer to you Ready to sell me that land yet

No

Going to sell to the publicspirited bunch Dean and the rest

No

You mean that All rightall right Say Paine I admire your nerve
a good deal more than I do your judgment You must understand that I am
going to close that fool Lane of yours some time or other

Your understanding and mine differ on that point

Possibly but theyll agree before Im through I am going to close
that Lane

I think not

Im going to close it for two reasons First because its a condemned
nuisance and ought to be closed Second because I make it a point to
get what I go after I cant afford not to It is doing that very thing
that has put me where I am

There was nothing to be said in answer to a statement like that I did
not try to answer it

Where youre holding down a job like mine he continued crossing
his knees and looking out across the bay you have to get what you go
after Im down here and I mean to stay here as long as I want to but
I havent let go of my job by a good deal Ive got private
wirestelegraph and telephonein my house and I keep in touch with
things in the Street as much as I ever did If anybody tries to get
ahead of the old man because they think hes turned farmer theyll find
out their mistake in a hurry

This seemed to be a soliloquy I could not see how it applied to me He
went on talking

Sounds like bragging doesnt it he said reading my thoughts as if
I had spoken them It isnt Im just trying to show you why I cant
afford not to have my own way If I miss a trick big or little
somebody else wins When I was younger just butting into the game
there was another fellow trying to get hold of a lead mine out West that
I was after He beat me to it at first He was a big toad in the puddle
and I was a little one But I didnt quit I waited round the corner
By and by I saw my chance He was in a hole and I had the cover to the
hole Before I let him out I owned that mine It cost me more than it
was worth I lost money on it But I had my way and he and the rest had
found out that I intended to have it That was worth a lot more than I
lost in the mine Now this Lane proposition is a little bit of a thing
its picayune I should live right along if I didnt get it But because
I want it because Ive made up my mind to have it Im going to have
it one way or another See

I shrugged my shoulders This seems to me like wasting time Mr
Colton I said

Then your seeing is away off Look here Paine Im through fiddling
with the deal Im through with that undertaker postmaster or any other
gobetween I just wanted you to understand my position thats why Ive
told you all this Now well talk figures I might go on bidding and
youd go on saying no of course But I shant bid Ill just say this
When you are ready to selland Ill put you where you will be some
day

I rose Mr Colton I said sharply you had better not say any more
Im not afraid of you and

There there there who said anything about your being afraid Dont
get mad Im notnot now This is a business matter between friends
and

Friends

Sure Business friends Im talking to you as I would to any other chap
I intended to beat in a deal theres nothing personal about it When I
get you so youre ready to sell Ill give you five thousand dollars for
that strip of land

I actually staggered I said what Lute had said to me

Youre crazy I cried Five thousand dollars for that land

Yes Oh I know what its worth Five hundred is for the land itself
The other fortyfive hundred is payment for the privilege of having my
own way Want to close with me now

It took me some time to answer No is a short and simple word but I
found it tremendously difficult to pronounce Yet I did pronounce it
I am glad to say After all that I had said before I would have been
ashamed to do anything else

He did not appear surprised at my refusal

All right he said Im not going to coax you Just remember that the
offer holds good and when you get ready to accept it sing out Well
looking at his watch I must be going My wife will think Ive fallen
into the bay or been murdered by the hostile natives Nerves are mean
things to have in the house you can take my word for that Goodby
Paine Thank you again for last night and the rest of it Mabel will
thank you herself when she sees you I presume

He was on his way to the door when I recovered presence of mind
sufficient to remember ordinary politeness

Your daughtererMiss Colton is well I stammered No ill effects
from her wettingand the shock

Not a bit Shes one of the kind of girls they turn out nowadays
Athletics and all that Her grandmother would have died probably after
such an upset but shes as right as I am Oh    erPaine next time
you go shooting let me know Maybe Id like to go along I used to be
able to hit a barn door occasionally

He stopped long enough to bite the end from a cigar and strolled away
smoking I sat down in the armchair Five thousand dollars   
Carver wont do    I will have the Lane some time or other
   Five thousand dollars    Next time you go shooting   
Friends    Five thousand dollars

Oh this was a nightmare I must wake up before it got any worse



CHAPTER X


Mother was the only one to whom I told the whole story of my experience
in the tempest and of Coltons call She and I had a long talk She
was as surprised to hear of the five thousand dollar offer as I had
been but that I had refused it did not surprise her She seemed to take
my refusal as a matter of course whereas I was more and more doubtful
of my sanity at the time I knew well enough what the opinion of others
would be concerning that sanity and I wondered whether or not they might
be right In fact I rather resented her calm certainty

Mother said I you speak as if the offer had been five cents instead
of five thousand dollars

What difference does it make Boy she asked If it had been only a
matter of price you would have sold for six hundred and fifty That is a
good deal more than the land is worth isnt it

I suppose so But five thousand is a small fortune to us I am not sure
that we have the right to refuse it

Roscoe if you were alone in this matterif I were not here to be
considered at allwould you have sold the land no matter what he
offered

I dont know Mother I think perhaps I should

I know you would not And I know the only reason you feel the refusal
may be wrong is because you are thinking what the money might do for me
Do you suppose I will permit you to sacrifice a principle you know is
right simply that I may have a few more luxuries which I dont need

But you do need them Why there are so many things you need

No I dont need one So long as I have you I am perfectly happy And
it would not make me more happy to know that you accepted a bribethat
is what it is a bribebecause of me No Boy you did exactly right
and I am proud of you

I am not particularly proud of myself

You should be Cant you see how differently Mr Colton regards you
already He does not condescend or patronize now

Humph he is grateful because I helped his daughter out of a scrape
thats all

It is more than that He respects you because you are what he called
you a man I fancy it is a new experience to him to find some one down
here at any rate to whom his millions make absolutely no difference

I am glad of it It may do him good

Yes I think it will And what you told him about the townspeople may
do him good too He will find as you and I have found that there are
no kinder better people anywhere You remember I warned you against
misjudging the Coltons Roscoe They too I am sure are good people at
heart in spite of their wealth

Mother you are too charitable for this earthtoo unworldly
altogether

Havent you and I reason to be charitable There there let us forget
the land and the money Roscoe I should like to meet this Miss Colton
She must be a brave girl

She is brave enough

I suppose poor Mr Carver is in disgrace Perhaps it was not his fault
altogether

This was a trifle too much I refused to be charitable to Victor

I heard from him or of him next day I met Captain Jed Dean at the
bank where I had called to see Taylor and inquire concerning how he
and Nellie got home from the festival They had had a damp though safe
journey I learned and the Methodist ladies had cleared seventyfour
dollars and eightyfive cents from the entertainment

Captain Jed entered the door as I left the cashiers gate

Ship ahoy Ros hailed the captain genially Make port safe and
sound after the flood Id have swapped my horse and buggy for Noahs
Ark that night and wouldnt have asked any boot neither Did you see
Mullets bridge Elnathan says he callates hes got willow kindlin
enough to last him all summer Ready split toothe lightnin attended
to that Lute Rogers dont talk about nothin else I callate he wishes
lightnin would strike your woodpile then hed be saved considerble
labor hey

He laughed and I laughed with him

I understood Princess Colton was out in the wust of it went on
Captain Jed Did you hear how her horse ran away

Yes I answered shortly I heard about it

Never stopped till it got half way to West Bayport The coachman
hangin onto the reins and swearin at the top of his lungs all the
time Bije Ellis who lives up that way says the road smells like a
match factory even yetso much brimstone in the air The girl got
home somehow or other they tell me I callate her fine duds got their
nevergetover Nellie says the hat she was wearin come from Paris or
some such foreign place Well the rain falls on the just and unjust
so scriptur tells us and its true enough Only the unjust in this case
can afford new hats bettern the just a considerble sight Denboros
lost a promisin new citizen did you know it

Whom do you mean

Hadnt you heard That young Carver feller shook the dustthe mud I
meanof our roads off his shoes this mornin He went away on the up
train

Here was news The up train I repeated You mean he has gone for
good

I should call it for good for our good anyhow Yes hes gone Went
to the depot in Coltons automobile His majesty went with him furs
the platform The gang that saw the proceedins said the goodbys want
affectin Colton didnt shed any tears and young Carver seemed to be
pretty down at the mouth

But what makes you think he has gone for good I asked

Why Alvin Baker was there same as he usually is and he managed to be
nigh enough to hear the last wordsif there had been any

And there were not

Nothin to amount to much Nothin about comin back anyhow Colton
said somethin about bein remembered to the young fellers ma and
Carver said Thanks and that was all Alvin said twas pretty chilly
Theyve got it all figgered out at the postoffice you see Carver was
to come back to the meetin house and pick up his princess and he never
come She started without him and got run away with Some of the folks
paddlin home from the festival saw the auto go by and heard the crowd
inside singin and laughin and hollerin Nobodys goin to sing a
night like that unless theyve got cargo enough below decks to make em
forget the wet outside And Beriah Doane was over to Ostable yesterday
and he says its town talk there that young Parkerthe boy the auto
crowd was sayin goodby to at the hotelhad to be helped up to his
room No I guess likely the Colton girl objected to her fellers
gettin tight and forgettin her so he and she had a row and her dad
the emperor give him his discharge papers Sounds reasonable dont you
think so yourself

I imagined that the surmise was close to the truth I nodded and turned
away I did not like Carver I detested him but somehow I no longer
felt triumph at his discomfiture I wondered if he really cared for the
girl he had lost It was difficult to think of him as really caring for
any one except himself but if I had been in his place and had through
my own foolishness thrown away the respect and friendship of such a
girl    Yes I was beginning to feel a little of Mothers charity
for the young idiot now that he could no longer insult and patronize
me

Captain Jed followed me to the bank door

Say Ros he said changed your mind about sellin that Lane land
yet

No I answered impatiently Theres no use talking about that
Captain Dean

All right all right Humph the fellers are gettin considerble fun
out of that Lane

In what way

He laughed Oh nothin he observed with a wink only    Heard
any extry hurrahin over to your place lately

No Captain what do you mean

I dont mean nothin But I shouldnt wonder if the Great Panjandrum
and his folks was reminded that that Lane was still open thats all
Ho ho So long Ros

I did not catch his meaning at the time A few days later I discovered
it by accident I had been up to the village and was on my way home by
the short cut As I crossed the field behind Sylvanus Snows abandoned
house the spot where Miss Colton and I had waited on the porch the
night of the thunder shower I heard the rattle of a cart going down the
Lane There was nothing unusual in this of itself but with it I heard
the sound of loud voices One of these voices was so loud that I caught
the words

Now boys start her up Three cheers for the Star Spangled Banner and
make em loud Let her go

The cheers followed uproarious ones

Try it again commanded the voice And keep her up all the way along
Well shake up the nerves I guess Hooray

This was enough I understood now what Dean had meant by the Coltons
realizing that the Lane was still open I ran at full speed through the
scrub and bushes through the grove and emerged upon the Lane directly
opposite the Colton estate The wagonZeb Kendricks weir cartwas
approaching Zeb was driving and behind him in the body of the cart
were four or five young fellows whom I recognized as belonging to the
billiard room gang an unorganized society whose members worked only
occasionally but were responsible for most of the mischief and disorder
in our village Tim Hallet a sort of leader in that society with the
reputation of having been expelled from school three times and never
keeping a job longer than a fortnight was on the seat beside Kendrick
his back to the horse Zeb was grinning broadly

The wagon came nearer the horse barely moving Tim Hallet waved his
arm

Now boys he shouted lets have some music

 Everybody works but father
 And he sets around all day

Whoop her up

They whooped her up I stepped out into the road

Here I shouted Stop that Stop it do you hear Kendrick what is
all this

The song stopped in the middle of the verse Zeb jerked the reins and
shouted Whoa Hallet and his chorus turned They had been gazing at
the big house but now they turned and looked at me

Hello Ros said Kendrick still grinning but rather sheepishly How
be you Got quite a band aboard aint I

Hello cried Hallet Its Ros himself Ros youre all RIGHT
Hi boys lets give three cheers for the feller that dont toady to
nobodymillionaires nor nobody elsehooray for Ros Paine

The cheering that followed was not quite as loud as the previous
outburstsome of the gang may have noticed my attitude and
expressionbut it was loud enough Involuntarily I glanced toward the
Colton mansion I saw no one at the windows or on the veranda and I was
thankful for that The blood rushed to my face I was so angry that for
the moment I could not speak

Tim Hallet appeared to consider my silence and my crimson cheeks as
acknowledgments of the compliment just paid me

Callate they heard that over yonder he crowed Dont you think so
Ros Weve showed em what we think of you now lets give our opinion
of them Three groans for old Colton Come on

Even Zeb seemed to consider this as going too far for he protested

Hold on Tim he cautioned A jokes a joke but thats a little too
much aint it Ros

Too much be darned scoffed Hallet Well show em Now boys

The groans were not given I sprang into the road seized the horse by
the bridle and backed the wagon into the bank Tim insecurely balanced
fell off the seat and joined his comrades on the cart floor

Hi shouted the startled driver What you doin Ros Whats that
for

You go back where you come from I ordered Turn around Get out of
here

I saved him the trouble by completing the turn When I dropped the
bridle the horses head was pointing toward the Lower Road

Now get out of here I repeated Go back where you come from

Butbut Ros protested Zeb I dont want to go back Im goin to
the shore

Then youll have to go some other way You cant cross my property

Hallet on his knees looked out over the seat

Whats the matter with you he asked angrily Didnt you say the
town could use this Lane

Yes Any one may use it as long as he behaves himself When he doesnt
behave he forfeits the privilege Kendrick you hear me Go back

But I dont want to go back Ros If I do Ill have to go clear round
by Myricks two mile out of my way

You should have thought of that before you brought that crowd with
you I wont have this Lane made a public nuisance by any one Zeb Im
ashamed of you

Zeb turned to his passengers There he whined I told you so Tim I
said you hadnt ought to act that way

Aw what are you givin us sneered Hallet You thought twas as
funny as anybody Zeb Kendrick Look here Ros Paine I thought you was
down on them Coltons We fellers are only havin a little fun with em
for bein so stuckup and hoggish Cant you take a joke

Not your kind Go back Zeb

Butbut cant I use the Lane NO more pleaded the driver I wont
fetch em here agin

Well see about that You cant use it this time Now go

Zeb reluctantly spoke to his horse and the wagon began to move Hallet
swore a string of oaths

Im on to you Paine he yelled Youre standin in with em after
all You wait till I see Captain Jed

In three strides I was abreast the carttail

See him then said I And tell him that if any one uses this Lane
for the purpose of wilfully annoying those living near it Ill not only
forbid his using it but Ill prosecute him for trespass I mean that
Stop I advise you not to say another word

I did not intend to prosecute Jim he was not worth it but I should
have thoroughly enjoyed dragging him out of that wagon and silencing him
by primitive methods My anger had not cooled to any extent He did not
speak to me again though I heard him muttering as the cart moved off
I remained where I was until I saw it turn into the Lower Road Then I
once more started for home

I was very much annoyed and disturbed Evidently this sort of thing had
been going on for some time and I had just discovered it It placed me
in a miserable light When Colton had declared as he had in both
our interviews that the Lane was a nuisance I had loftily denied the
assertion Now those idiots in the village were doing their best to
prove me a liar I should have expected such behavior from Hallet and
his friends but for Captain Dean to tacitly approve their conduct was
unexpected and provoking Well I had made my position plain at all
events But I knew that Tim would distort my words and that the idea of
my standing in with the Coltons while professing independence would
be revived I was destined to be detested and misunderstood by both
sides Yes Dorinda was right in saying that I might find sitting on the
fence uncomfortable It was all of that

I entered the grove and was striding on head down busy with these and
similar reflections when some one said Good morning Mr Paine

I stopped short came out of the day dream in which I had been giving
Captain Jed my opinion of his followers behavior looked up and saw
Miss Colton in the path before me

She was dressed in white a light simple summer gown Her straw hat was
simple also expensive simplicity doubtless but without a trace of the
horticultural exhibits with which Olinda Cahoon our Denboro milliner
was wont to deck the creations she prepared for customers Matilda
Dean would have sniffed at the hat and gown they were not nearly as
elaborate as those Nellie her daughter wore on Sundays But Matilda or
Nellie at their grandest could not have appeared as well dressed as this
girl no matter what she wore Just now she looked as Lute or Dorinda
might have said as if she came out of a band box

Good morning she said again She was perfectly selfpossessed
Remembrance of our transit of Mullets cranberry brook did not seem to
embarrass her in the least Nellie Dean would have giggled and blushed
but she did not

_I_ was embarrassed I admit it but I had sufficient presence of mind
to remove my hat

Good morning said I There flashed through my mind the thought that
if she had been in that grove for any length of time she must have
overheard my lively interview with Kendrick and Tim Hallet I wondered
if she had

Her next remark settled that question

I suppose she said soberly but with the same twinkle in her eye
which I had observed once or twice in her fathers that I should
apologize for being here on your property Mr Paine I judge that you
dont like trespassers

I was more nettled at Zeb and his crowd than ever So you saw that
performance I said Im sorry

I saw a little of it and Im afraid I heard the rest I was walking
here by the bluff and I could not help seeing and hearing

Humph Well I hope you understand Miss Colton that I did not know
until just now this sort of thing was going on

She smiled Oh I understand that she said You made that quite
plain Even those people in the wagon understood it I should imagine

I hope they did

I did not know you could be so fierce Mr Paine I had not expected
it You almost frightened me You were so verywell mild and
longsuffering on the other occasions when we met

I am not always so mild Miss Colton However if I had known you were
within hearing I might not have been quite so emphatic

Then I am glad you didnt know I think those ruffians were treated as
they deserved

Not half as they deserved I shall watch from now on and if there are
any more attempts at annoying you or your people I shall do more than
talk

Thank you They have been troublesomeof late I am sure we are very
much obliged to you all of us

Not at all

Oh yes we are Not only for this but forall the rest For your help
the other night especially I want to thank you for that

It was nothing I answered awkwardly

Nothing You are not very complimentary Mr Paine

I meanthat is I

You may consider rescuing shipwrecked young ladies afloat and ashore
nothingperhaps you do it so often that it is of little consequence to
you but I am not so modest I estimate my safety as worth something
even if you do not

I did not mean that of course Miss Colton You know I did not I
meant thatthat what I did was no more than any one else would have
done under the same circumstances You were in no danger you would
have been safe enough even if I had not happened along Please dont say
anything more about it

Very well But I am very glad you happened along nevertheless You
seem to have the faculty of happening along just at the right time

This sounded like a reference to the episode in the bay and I did not
care to discuss that

YouI believe your father said you were not ill after your
experience I observed hastily

Not in the least thank you And you

Oh I was all right Rather wet but I did not mind that I sail and
fish a good deal and water fresh or salt doesnt trouble me

This was an unlucky remark for it led directly to the subject I was
trying to avoid

So I should imagine she answered And that reminds me that I owe you
another debt of thanks for helping mehelping us out of our difficulty
in the boat I am obliged to you for that also Even though what you
saved was NOT worth five dollars

I looked up at her quickly She was biting her lips and there was a
smile at the corners of her mouth I could not answer immediately for
the life of me I would have given something if I had not told Colton of
Victors message and my reply

Your father misrepresented my meaning Im afraid I stammered I was
angry when I sent that message It was not intended to include you

Thank you Father seemed inclined to agree with your estimatepart of
it at least He is very much interested in you Mr Paine

Yes I answered dryly I can understand that

Her smile broke into a ripple of laughter

You are quite distinctive in your way she said You may not be
aware of it but I have never known father to be so disturbed and
puzzled about any one as he is about you

Indeed

Yes he is indeed

I am sorry that I am the cause of so much mental strain

No you are not From what I have learned about you from him I think
you enjoy it You must It is great fun

Fun Well perhaps Does yourdoes Mrs Colton find it funny

She hesitated Well she answered more slowly to be perfectly
frankI presume that is what you want me to beI think Mother blames
you somewhat She is not well Mr Paine and this Lane of yours is her
pet bugbear just now Shelike the rest of uscannot understand why
you will not sell and because you will not she is ratherrather

I see Im not sure that I blame her I presume she has blamed me
for these outrageous disturbances in the Lane such as you have just
witnessed

She hesitated again Why yes she said more slowly still a little
I think She is not well as I said and she may have thought you were
if not instigating them at least aware of what was going on But I am
sure father does not think so

But you Miss Colton did you believe me responsible for them

No

Why not

Because from what I have seen of you you did not seem to me like that
kind of a man You kept your temper that day in the boat though you had
a good reason for losing it All this with a gesture toward the Lane
the shouting and noise and petty insults was so little and mean and
common I did not believe you would permit it if you knew And from
what I have learned about you I was sure you would not

From what you learned about me From your father

No

Then from whom pray

From your friends From that Mr Taylor and Miss Dean and the others
They spoke of you so highly and of your mother and your care of her
They described you as a gentleman and no gentleman would countenance
THAT

I was so astonished that I blurted out my next question without
thinking

You were speaking to them about ME I cried

Her manner changed Possibly she thought I was presuming on our chance
acquaintance or that she made a mistake in admitting even a casual
interest I might consider that interest to be real instead of merely
perfunctory At any rate I noticed a difference in her tone It was as
if she had suddenly withdrawn behind the fence which marked the border
of our social line

Oh she said carelessly I did not crossquestion of course
Puzzles are always interesting more or less And a puzzle which
perplexed my father was certainly unique So I was a trifle curious
thats all

I came to earth with a thud

I see I said curtly Well I presume I should thank my friends for
the testimonials to my character And I promise you that you shall not
be annoyed again Good morning Miss Colton

I was turning away when she spoke my name

Mr Paine she said

Yes Miss Colton

I have not explained why I was here on your land this morning

That is all right You are quite welcome to be here at any time

Thank you I told you I was walking by the bluff that is true but it
isnt the whole truth I was trying to muster courage to call on your
mother

I looked at her in amazement

Call on Mother I repeated

Yes I have heard a great deal about your mother and nothing except
the very best I think I should like to know her Do you think she would
consider me presuming and intrusive if I did call

Why Miss Colton I

Please be frank about it Mr Paine And please believe that my call
would not be from idle curiosity I should like to know her Of course
if this disagreement about the land makes a difference if she feels
resentful toward us I will not think of such a thing Does she Why do
you smile I am in earnest

I did not mean to smile Miss Colton The idea of Mothers feeling
resentment toward any one seemed absurd to me that was all

Then may I call on her

Certainly That is ifif you think it wise If your mother

Oh Mother has long ago given up trying to solve me I am a greater
puzzle to her than you seem to be to everyone Mr Paine I have spoken
to my father about it and he is quite willing His difference with you
is purely a business one as you know

Some of the business had been oddly conducted but I did not raise
the point I could not reason just then That this spoiled citybred
daughter of Big Jim Colton should wish to know my mother was beyond
reasoning

She said good morning and we parted I walked home racking my brains
to find the answer to this new conundrum It was a whim on her part of
course inspired by something George or Nellie had told her I did
not know whether to resent the whim or not whether to be angry or
indifferent If she intended to inspect Mother as a possible object of
future charity I should be angry and the first call would be the last
But Mother herself would settle all questions of charity I knew that
And the girl had not spoken in a patronizing way She had declared that
idle curiosity had no part in her wish She seemed in earnest What
would Mother say when I told her

Lute was just coming through the gate as I approached it He was in high
good humor

Im goin up street he declared Anything you want me to fetch you
from the store Ros

I looked at my watch It was only eleven oclock

Up street I repeated I thought you were slated to wash windows
this forenoon I heard Dorinda give you your orders to that effect You
havent finished washing them already

No with a broad grin I aint finished em Fact is I aint begun
em yet

So Does Dorinda know that you are going up street

Umhm She knows Anyhow she knows Im goin somewheres She told me
to go herself

She did Why

Dont ask ME I was all ready to wash the windows had the bucket
pumped full and everything But when I come into the dininroom she
sung out to know what I was doin with all that water on her clean
floor Why Dorindy I says Im agoin to wash them windows sames
you told me to No you aint says she But what will I do says
I I dont care says she Clear out of here thats all But
wherell I clear out to I wanted to know I dont care she snaps
again savage as a settin hen so longs you clear out of my sight
So here I be Dont ask me why she changed her mind _I_ dont know
Nothin you want to the store

No

Say Ros you know what I think

Far be it from me to presume to guess your thoughts Lute

Well I think this is a strange world and the strangest thing in it is
a woman You never can tell what theyll do ten minutes at a stretch
I

All right Lute Ill hear the rest of the philosophy later

Philosophy or not its the livin truth And when youre as old as I
be youll know it

I went in through the diningroom steering clear of Dorinda who
scarcely looked up from her floor scrubbing

Mother said I entering the darkened bedroom I just met the Colton
girl and what do you suppose she told me

That she was very grateful to you for coming to her rescue the other
night

That of course But she told me something else She said she was
coming to call on you On YOU Mother

I dont know what answer I expected I flung the announcement like a
bombshell and was ready for almost any sort of explosion at all

Did she observed Mother placidly I am very glad I have no doubt I
shall like her

My next remark had nothing to do with Miss Colton

Well by George I exclaimed with emphasis Lute IS a philosopher
after all I take off my hat to him



CHAPTER XI


I met Mabel Colton several times during the following week Once at the
place where I had met her before in the grove by the edge of the bluff
and again walking up the Lane in company with her father Once also on
the Lower Road though that could scarcely be called a meeting for I
was afoot and she and her father and mother were in the automobile

Only at the meeting in the grove were words exchanged between us She
bowed pleasantly and commented on the wonderful view

I am trespassing again you see she said Taking advantage of your
goodnature Mr Paine This spot is the most attractive I have found in
Denboro

I observed that the view from her verandas must be almost the same

Almost but not quite she said These pines shut off the inlet
below and all the little fishing boats One of them is yours I
suppose Which

That is my launch there I replied pointing

The little white one You built it yourself I think Father said

He was mistaken if he said that I am not clever enough to build a
boat Miss Colton I bought the Comfort secondhand

I dont know why I added the secondhand Probably because I had not
yet freed my mind from the bitternessyes and envywhich the sight
of this girl and her people always brought with it It is comparatively
easy to be free from envy if one is what George Taylor termed a
neverwas for a has been it is harder

The boats name was the only portion of my remark which attracted her
attention

The Comfort she repeated That is a jolly name for a pleasure boat

It is my mothers name I answered

Is it Why I remember now Miss Dean told me I beg your pardon Mr
Paine It is a pretty name at all events

Thank you

I must have misunderstood Father I was sure he said that boat building
was your business

No He saw me overhauling the engine and perhaps that gave him the
impression that I was a builder I told him I was not but no doubt he
forgot I have no business Miss Colton

I think she was surprised She glanced at me curiously and her lips
opened as if to ask another question She did not ask it however and
except for a casual remark or two about the view and the blueness of
the water in the bay she said nothing more I rather expected she would
refer to her intention of calling on Mother but she did not mention the
subject I inferred that she had thought better of her whim

On the other occasions when we met she merely bowed Big Jim nodded
carelessly Mrs Colton from her seat in the auto nodded also though
her majestic bow could scarcely be termed a nod It was more like the
acknowledgment by a queen in her chariot of the applauding citizen
on the sidewalk She saw me and she deigned to let me know that I was
seen that was all

But when I inferred that her daughter had forgotten or had decided not
to make the call at our house I misjudged the young lady I returned
one afternoon from a cruise up and down the bay in the Comfort to find
our small establishmentthe Rogers portion of it at leastin a high
state of excitement Lute and Dorinda were in the kitchen and before I
reached the back door which was open I heard their voices in animated
discussion

Why wouldnt I say it Dorinda pleaded Lute You cant blame me
none There I was with my sleeves rolled up and just settin in the
chair restin my arms a jiffy and thinkin which window Id wash next
when there come that knock at the door Thinks I Its Asa Peters
daughters youngone peddlin clams Thats what come to my mind fust
That idee popped right into my head it did

Found plenty of room when it got there I callate snapped Dorinda
Must have felt lonesome

Thats it keep on pitchin into me I swan to man sometimes I get so
discouraged and wore out and recklesshello heres Ros You ask him
now Ros shes layin into me because I didnt understand what

Roscoe broke in his wife I never was more mortified in all my born
days He

Let me tell you all about it Ros I went to the doorthinkin twas
a peddler you know had this old suit on all sloshed up with soapsuds
and water and a wet rag in my hand and there she stood styled up like
the Queen of Sheby Well sir Ill leave it to you if taint enough to
surprise anybody HER comin HERE

That want any reason why you should behave like a natural born

Hold on you let me finish tellin Roscoe Good afternoon says she
Is Mrs Paine in Said it just like that she did I was so flustered
up from the sight of her that I didnt sense it right off and I says
What maam Is Mrs Paine in says she In says I

Just like a poll parrot interjected Dorinda

Are you goin to let me tell this or aint you In says I hadnt
sensed it yet you see Is Mrs Paine to home she says Now your ma
Ros aint never been nowheres else BUT home sence land knows when so
I supposed she must mean somebody else Who says I again Mrs
Comfort Paine says she She raised her voice a little guessed I was
deef probably

If shed guessed you was dumb she wouldnt have been fur off
commented Dorinda I had not seen her so disturbed for many a day

Her husband disdained to notice this interruption

Mrs Comfort Paine says she he continued She is in And I says
In

No you didnt You said In where And she had all she could do
to keep from laughin I see her face as I got to the door and its a
mercy I got there when I did Land knows what youd have said next

But Dorindy I tell you I thought

YOU thought I know what SHE must have thought That shed made a
mistake and run afoul of an asylum for the feebleminded

Umph I should have GOT feebleminded if Id had any more of that kind
of talk What made her ask if a sick woman like Comfort was in and to
home Couldnt be nowheres else could she

Rubbish she meant could Mrs Paine see folks thats all

See em How you talk She aint blind

Oh my soul and body She was tryin to ask if she might make a call on
Comfort

Well then why didnt she ask it stead of wantin to know if she was
in

Thats the hightoned way TO ask and youd ought to have known it

Humph Do tell Well I aint tony myself Dont have no chance to be
in this house Nothin but work work work tongue tongue tongue for
me around here Im disgusted thats what I am

YOURE disgusted What about me

I had listened to as much of this little domestic disagreement as I
cared to hear

Wait a minute I said What is all this Who has been here to see
Mother

Both answered at once

That Colton girl cried Lute

That Mabel Colton said Dorinda

Miss Colton She has been here this afternoon

Umhm Dorinda nodded emphatically She stayed in your mas room
most an hour

Twas fiftythree minutes declared Lute I timed her by the clock
And she fetched a great big bouquet Comfort says she

I waited to hear no more but went into Mothers room The little bed
chamber was fragrant with the perfume of flowers A cluster of big
Jacqueminot roses drooped their velvety petaled heads over the sides
of the blue and white pitcher on the bureau Mother loved flowers and
I frequently brought her the old fashioned posies from Dorindas little
garden or wild blossoms from the woods and fields But roses such as
these were beyond my reach nowadays They grew in greenhouses not in
the gardens of country people

Mother did not move as I entered and I thought she was asleep But as I
bent over the roses she turned on the pillow and spoke

Arent they beautiful Roscoe she said

Yes I answered They are beautiful

Do you know who brought them to me

Yes Mother Lute told me

She did call you see She kept her word It was kind of her wasnt
it

I sat down in the rocking chair by the window

Well I asked after a moment what did she say Did she condescend
to pity her pauper neighbors

Roscoe

Did she express horrified sympathy and offer to call your case to the
attention of her cousin in charge of the Poor Ward in the City General
Hospital like that woman from the Harniss hotel last summer

Boy How can you

Oh well I am a jealous beast Mother I admit it But I have not been
able to bring you flowers like that and it galls me to think that others
can They dont deserve to have all the beautiful things in life while
the rest of us have none

But it isnt her fault that she has them is it And it was kind to
share them with us

I suppose so Well what did she say to you Dorinda says she was with
you nearly an hour What did you and she talk about She did not offer
charity did she

Do you think I should have accepted it if she had Roscoe I have
never seen you so prejudiced as you are against our new neighbors It
doesnt seem like you at all And if her father and mother are like
Miss Mabel you are very wrong I like her very much

You would try to like any one Mother

I did not have to try to like her And I was a little prejudiced too
at first She was so wealthy and an only child I feared she might be
conceited and spoiled But she isnt

Not conceited Humph

No not really At first she seemed a trifle distant and I thought her
haughty but afterward when her strangeness and constraint had worn
away she was simple and unaffected and delightful And she is very
pretty isnt she

Yes

She told me a great deal about herself She has been through Vassar and
has traveled a great deal This is the first summer since her graduation
which she has not spent abroad She and I talked of Rome and Florence
II told her of the month I spent in Italy when you were a baby
Roscoe

You did not tell her anything more Mother Anything she should not
know

Boy reproachfully

Pardon me Mother Of course you didnt Did she tell you why she
called on uson you I mean

Yes in a way I imaginethough she did not say sothat you are
responsible for that She and Nellie Dean seem to be well acquainted
almost friendly which is odd for I can scarcely think of two girls
more different But she likes Nellie that is evident and Nellie and
George have told her about you and me

I see And so she was curious concerning the interesting invalid
Probably anything even mildly interesting is a godsend to her down
here Did she mention the Shore Lane rumpus

Yes Although I mentioned it first It was plain that she could not
understand your position in the matter Roscoe and I explained it as
well as I could I told her that you felt the Lane was a necessity to
the townspeople and that under the circumstances you could not sell
I told her how deeply you sympathized with her mother

Did you tell her that

Why yes It is true isnt it

Humph Mildly so maybe What more did she say

She said she thought she understood better now I told her about you
Boy and what a good son you had been to me How you had sacrificed
your future and your career for my sake Of course I could not go into
particulars at all but we talked a great deal about you Roscoe

That must have been deliriously interestingto her

I think it was She told me of your helping her home through the storm
and of something else you had not told me Boy of your bringing her and
Mr Carver off the flat in the boat that day Why did you keep that a
secret

It was not worth telling

She thought it was She laughed about it said you handled the affair
in a most businesslike and unsentimental way she never felt more like
a bundle of drygoods in her life but that that appeared to be your
manner of handling people It was a somewhat startling manner but very
effective she said I dont know what she meant by that

I knew but I did not explain

You dont mean to say Mother that you glorified me to her for an
hour I demanded

No indeed We talked of ever so many things Of books and pictures
and music Im afraid I was rather wearisome It seemed so good to have
some oneexcept you of course dearto discuss such subjects with
Most of my callers are not interested in them

I was silent

She is coming again she says continued Mother She has some new
books she is going to lend me You must read them to me And arent
those roses wonderful She picked them herself in their conservatory
I told her how fond you were of flowers

I judged that the young lady must have gone away with the idea that I
was a combination of longshore lout and effeminate dilettante with the
financial resources of the former She might as well have that idea as
any other I supposed but in her eyes I must be more of a freak than
ever I should take care to keep out of the sight of those eyes as much
as possible But that the millionaires daughter had made a hit on the
occasion of her first call was plain Not only had Mother been favorably
impressed but even the practical and unromantic Dorindas shell was
dented She deigned to observe that the young lady seemed to have
considerble commonsense considerin her bringin up This from
Dorinda was high praise and I wondered what the caller had said or
done to win such a triumph Lute made the matter clear

By time he said when he and I were together that girls a smart
one Id give somethin to have her kind of smartness Dorindy was
terrible cranky all the time she was in your mas room and I didnt know
what would happen when she come out But the fust thing she done when
she come out was to look around the dinin room and say Oh what a
pleasant homey place And so clean Why it is perfectly spotless
Land sakes the old lady thawed out like a cranberry bog in April After
that they talked about housekeepin and cookin and such sociable as
could be Dorindys goin to give her her receipt for doughnuts next
time she comes And I bet that girl never cooked a doughnut in her life
or ever will If I could think of the right thing to say like that
twould save me moren one earache But I never do think of it till the
next day and then its too late

He borrowed my tobacco filled his pipe and continued

Say Ros he asked whats your idea of what made her come here

To see Mother of course I answered

Thats your notion is it

Certainly What else

Humph Theres other sick folks in town Why dont she go to see them

Perhaps she does I dont know

I bet you ten cents she dont No Ive been reasonin of it out
same as I genrally do and Ive got some notions of my own You dont
callate her pa sent her sos to sort of soft soap around toward his
gettin the Shore Lane You dont callate twas part of that game do
you

That supposition had crossed my mind more than once I was ashamed of it
and now I denied it indignantly

Of course not I answered

Well I dont think so myself But if taint that its another
reason She may be interested in Comfort I dont say she aint but
that aint all shes interested in

What do you mean

Never mind I aint said nothin Im just waitin to see thats all
I have had some experience in this world I have Theres different
times comin for this family you set that down in your logbook Ros
Paine

Look here Lute if you are hinting that Miss Colton or her people
intend offering us charity

Who said anything about charity No if she had that idee in her head
her talk with your ma would drive it out Taint charity I aint
sayin what tis    I wonder how twould seem to be rich

Lute youre growing more foolish every day

So Dorindy says but she nor you aint offered no proof yet All right
you wait and see And say Ros dont mention our talk to Dorindy Shes
moren extry down on me just now and if I breathe that Mabel Coltons
name she hops right up in the air Howd I know that askin if a woman
whos been sick in bed six year or more was in meant could she have
folks come to see her

Mother would have discussed the Coltons with me frequently but
I avoided the subject as much as possible The promised books
arrivedbrought over by Johnson the butler who viewed our humble
quarters with lofty disdainand I read one of them aloud to Mother a
chapter each evening More flowers came also and the darkened bedroom
became a bower of beauty and perfume If I had yielded to my own wishes
I should have returned both roses and books It was better as I saw
it that we and our wealthy neighbors had nothing to do with each other
Real friendship was out of the question the memory of Mrs Coltons
frigid bow and her reference to me as a person proved that Her
daughter might think otherwise or might think that she thought so
but I knew better However I did not like to pain Mother by refusing
offerings which to her were expressions of sympathy and regard so I
had no protest and tried to enthuse over the gifts and loans After
all what did they amount to One tearose bred from Dorindas carefully
tended bush or one gushful story book selected by Almena Doane from
the new additions to the town library and sent because she thought Mrs
Comfort might find it sort of soothin and distractin meant more real
unselfish thought and kindly feeling than all the conservatory exotics
and new novels which the rich girls whim supplied from her overflowing
store I was surprised only that the whim lasted so long

Behind all this I think and confirming my feeling was the fact that
Miss Colton did not repeat her call A week or more passed and she did
not come I caught glimpses of her occasionally in the auto or at the
postoffice but I took care that she should not see me I did not wish
to be seen though precisely why I could not have explained even to
myself The memory of that night in the rain and of our meetings in the
grove troubled me because I could not keep them from my mind They kept
recurring no matter what I did or where I went No I did not want
to meet her again Somehow the sight and memory of her made me more
dissatisfied and discontented than ever I found myself moodily
wishing for things beyond my reach longing to be something more than I
wasmore than the nobody which I knew I must always be I remembered my
feelings on the morning of the day when I first saw her Now they seemed
almost like premonitions

I kept away not only from her but from George Taylor and Captain
Dean and the townspeople I went to the village scarcely at all Sim
Eldredge who had evidently received orders from headquarters to drop
the Lane agency troubled me no more merely glowering reproachfully
when we met and Alvin Baker whose note had been renewed although he
hailed me with effusive cordiality did not press his society upon
me having no axe to grind at present Zeb Kendrick was using the
Lane again but he took care to bring no more billiard roomers as
passengers I had as yet heard nothing from my quarrel with Tim Hallet

I spent a good deal of my time in the Comfort or wandering about the
shore and in the woods One warm cloudy morning the notion seized me to
go up to the ponds and try for black bass There are bass in some of the
larger pondslakes they would be called anywhere else except on Cape
Codand if one is lucky and the weather is right and the bait
tempting they may be caught This particular morning promised to
furnish the proper brand of weather and a short excursion on the flats
provided a supply of shrimps and minnows for bait Dorinda who happened
to be in good humor put up a lunch for me and at seven oclock with
my rod and landing net in their cases strapped with my fishing boots
and coffee pot to my back and my bait pail in one hand and lunch
basket in the other I started on my tramp It was a long four miles
to Seaburys Pond my destination and Lute to whom like most
country people the idea of a fourmile walk was sheer lunacy urged my
harnessing the horse and driving there But I knew the overgrown wood
roads and the difficulty of piloting a vehicle through them and
moreover I really preferred to go afoot So I marched off and left him
protesting

Very few summer peopleand only summer people or irresponsible persons
like myself waste time in freshwater fishing on the Capeknew where
Seaburys Pond was It lay far from macadam roads and automobile
thoroughfares and its sandy shores were bordered with verdureclad hills
shutting it in like the sides of a bowl To reach it from Denboro one
left the Bayport road at Beriah Holts place followed Beriahs
cow path to the pasture plunged into the oak and birch grove at
the southern edge of that pasture emerged on a grassgrown and
bushencumbered track which had once been the way to some early
settlers home and had been forsaken for years and followed that
track in all its windings until he saw the gleam of water between the
upper fringe of brush and the lower limbs of the trees Then he left the
track and clambered down the steep slope to the pond

I am a good walker but I was tired long before I reached the slope
The bait pail which I refilled with fresh water at Beriahs pump grew
heavier as I went on and I began to think Lute knew what he was talking
about when he declared me to be plumb crazy hoofin it four mile
loaded down with all that dunnage However when the long hoof was
over and I sat down in a patch of hogcranberry vines for a smoke
with the pond before me I was measurably happy This was the sort of
thing I liked Here there were no Shore Lane controversies but real
independence and peace

After my smoke was finished and I had rested I carried my dunnage
around to the point where I intended to begin my fishing put the lunch
basket in a shady place beneath the bushes and the bait pail in the
water nearby changed my shoes for the fishing boots rigged my rod and
was ready

At first the fishing was rather poor The pond was full of perch
and they were troublesome By and by however I hooked a fourpound
pickerel and he stirred my lagging ambition I waded on casting and
playing beyond the lily pads and sedge At last I got my first bass a
small one and had scarcely landed him than a big fellow struck fought
rose and broke away That was spur sufficient All the forenoon I waded
about the shores of that pond When at halfpast eleven the sun came
out and I knew my sport was over for the time at least I had four
basstwo of them fine onesand two pickerel Then I remembered my
appetite and Dorindas luncheon

I went back to the point and inspected the contents of the basket
Sandwiches cold chicken eggs doughnuts and apple puffs They looked
good to me Also there were pepper and salt in one paper sugar in
another coffee in a third and milk in a bottle I collected some dry
chips and branches and prepared to kindle a fire As I bent over the
heap of sticks and chips I heard the sound of horses hoofs in the woods
near by

I was surprised and annoyed The principal charm of Seabury Pond was
that so few people visited it Also fewer still knew how good the
fishing was there I was not more than ordinarily selfish but I did not
care to have the place overrun with excursionists from the city who
had no scruples as to number and size of fish caught and would ruin
the sport as they had ruined it at other and better known ponds The
passerby whoever he wasa native probablywould if he saw me ask
questions concerning my luck and be almost sure to tell every one he
met I left my fire unkindled stepped back to the shade of the bushes
and waited in silence hoping the driver would go on without stopping
There was no real road on this side of the pond but there was an
abandoned wood track like that by which I had come The horse was
approaching along the track the sounds of hoofs and crackling branches
grew plainer

The odd part of it was that I heard no rattle of wheels It was almost
as if the person was on horseback This seemed impossible because no
one in Denboro or Bayportno one I could think of at leastowned or
rode a saddle horse Yet the hoof beats grew louder and there was no
squeak or jolt or rattle to bear them company They came to a point in
the woods directly opposite where I sat in the shade of the bushes and
there they stopped Then they recommenced and the crackle of branches
was louder than ever The rider whoever he was was coming down the
bank to the pond

A moment more and the tall swamphuckleberry bushes at the edge of
the sandy beach parted and between them stepped gingerly a cleancut
handsome brown horse which threw up its head at the sight of the water
and then trotted lightly toward it The rider who sat so easily in the
saddle was a girl And the girl was Mabel Colton

She did not notice me at first but gave her attention to the horse The
animal waded into the water to its knees and in obedience to a pull on
the reins stopped bent its head and began to drink Then the rider
turned in her seat looked about her saw the heap of wood for the fire
the open lunch basket the rods and landingnet andme

I had stepped from the bushes when she first appeared and was standing
motionless staring I imagine like what Dorinda sometimes called her
husbanda born gump There was Fate in this no doubt about it The
further I went to avoid this girl and the more outlandish and forsaken
the spot to which I fled the greater the certainty of our meeting
A feeling of helplessness came over me as if I were in the clutch of
destiny and no effort of mine could break that clutch

For a moment she looked as if she might be thinking the same thing She
started when she saw me and her lips parted

Oh she exclaimed softly Then we gazed at each other without
speaking

She was the first to recover from the surprise Her expression changed
The look of alarm caused by my sudden appearance left her face but the
wonder remained

Why Why Mr Paine she cried Is it you

I stepped forward

Why Miss Colton said I

She drew a breath of relief It IS you she declared I was beginning
to believe in hallucinations How you startled me What are you doing
here

That is exactly what I was going to ask you I replied I am here for
a fishing excursion But what brought you to this outoftheway place

She smiled and patted the horses shoulder Don here brought me
she answered He saw the water and I knew he was thirsty so I came
straight down the bank But I didnt expect to find any one here I
havent seen a horse or a human being for an hour What a pretty little
lake this is What is its name

It is called Seaburys Pond How did you find it

I didnt Don found it He and I came for a gallop in the woods and I
let him choose his own paths I have been in his charge all the morning
I havent the least idea where we are There Don you have had enough
and you are splashing us dreadfully Come back

She backed the horse out of the water and turned his head toward the
woods

It is great fun to be lost she observed I didnt suppose any one
could be lost in Denboro

But this isnt Denboro Seaburys Pond is in Bayport township

Is it really In Bayport Then I must be a long way from home

You are four miles and a half at least More than that over the
road

She looked at her watch and frowned slightly

Dear me she said And it is after twelve already I am perfectly
sure I cant find the way back in time for luncheon

I shall be glad to go with you and show you the way

No indeed Don and I will get home safely This isnt the first
time we have been lost together though not on Cape Cod Of course
I shouldnt think of taking you from your fishing Have you had good
luck

Pretty fair Some bass and two goodsized pickerel

Really Bass I didnt know there were any about here May I see them

Certainly They are over there in the bushes

She swung lightly down from the saddle and taking her horse by the
bridle led him toward the spot where my catch lay covered with leaves
and wet grass I removed the covering and she bent over the fish

Oh splendid she exclaimed with enthusiasm That big one must be
a threepounder I envy you Bass fishing is great sport Did you get
these on a flythe bass I mean

No I use a fly in the spring and fall but seldom in June or July
here Those were taken with live baitshrimp The pickerel with minnows
Are you fond of fishing Miss Colton

Yes indeed Whoa Don steady Yes I fish a good deal in September
when we are at our lodge in the Adirondacks Trout there principally
But I have caught bass in Maine I thought I must give it up this year
I did not know there were fish in fresh water on the Cape

There are a few The people about here pay no attention to them They
scorn such small fry Cod and pollock are more in their line

I suppose so But that is all the better for you isnt it Were you
fishing when I interrupted you

No I was just getting ready for lunch My fire was ready to kindle

Fire Why did you need a fire

For my coffee

Coffee You are a luxurious picnicer Mr Paine Hot coffee on a
fishing trip and without a guide And you are unfeeling besides for
you remind me that I am very hungry I must go at once How far am I
from home Four miles did you say

Four and a half or more by road And the roads are like those you
have been traveling this morning I doubt if you could find the way
even with your horses help I must insist upon going with you as far as
the main road between Denboro and Bayport

I shall not permit it

But I insist

Her answer was a little laugh She put her foot in the stirrup and
vaulted to the saddle

Your insisting is useless you see she said You are on foot and I
have the advantage No Don and I will go alone thank you Now will
you please tell me the way

I shrugged my shoulders Go back along the road you came I said
until you reach the second no the third path to the right Follow
that to the second on the left Then follow that for two hundred yards
or so untilwell until you reach a clump of bushes high bushes
Behind these is another path a blind one and you must take care to
pick the right clump because there is another one with a path behind it
and that path joins the road to Harniss If you should take the Harniss
road you would go miles out of your way Take the blind path I speak of
and

She interrupted me Stop stop she exclaimed please dont I am
absolutely bewildered already I had no idea I was in such a maze Let
me see Second to the right third to the left

No third to the right and second to the left

And then the bushes and the choice of blind paths Don I see plainly
that you and I must trust to Providence Well it is fortunate that the
family are accustomed to my ways They wont be alarmed no matter how
late I may be

Miss Colton I am not going to allow you to go alone Of course I am
not I can set you on the right road and get back here in plenty of time
for fishing The fish are not hungry in the middle of the day

No but you are I know you must be becauseno good day Mr Paine

She spoke to the horse and he began to move I took my courage between
my teeth ran after the animal and seized the bridle

You are not going alone I said decidedly I was smiling but
determined

She looked at me in surprised indignation

What do you mean she said

I merely smiled Her chin lifted and her brows drew together I
recognized that look I had seen it before on that afternoon when I
announced my intention of carrying her from the dingy to the skiff

Will you be good enough to let go of my rein she asked Every word
was a sort of verbal icicle I felt the chill and my smile was rather
forced but I held the bridle

No I said serenely as I could For a minuteI suppose it was not
longer than that it seemed an hour to mewe remained as we were Then
her lips began to curl upward at the corners and to my surprise she
burst out laughing

Really Mr Paine she said you are the most impossible person I
ever met Do you always order people about this way I feel as if I were
about five years old and you were my nurse Are we to stand here the
rest of the afternoon

Yes unless you permit me to go with you and show you the way

But I cant Im not going to spoil your picnic I know you want your
lunch You must Or if you dont I want mine

If you go alone there are nine chances in ten that you will not get
home in time for dinner to say nothing of lunch

She looked at me oddly I thought and started to speak Whatever it
was she was going to say she evidently thought better of it for she
remained silent

Then I had a new idea Whether or not it was her look which inspired it
I do not know I think it must have been I never would have dared such
a thing without inspiration

Miss Colton I said hesitatingly if you really are notif you are
sure your people will not worry about youII should be glad to share
my lunch with you Then we could go home together afterward

She did not look at me now Instead she turned her head

Areare you sure there is enough for two she asked in a curiously
choked tone

By way of answer I led the horse to the bushes drew the lunch basket
from the shade and threw back the cover Dorindas picnic lunches were
triumphs and she had never put up a more tempting one

Miss Colton looked down into the basket

Oh she exclaimed

There appears to be enough doesnt there I observed drily

Butbut I couldnt think of    Are you sure I wont be    Thank
you Yes Ill stay

Before I could offer my hand to help her from the saddle she sprang to
the ground Her eyes were sparkling

Mr Paine she said in a burst of confidence it is shameless to
tell you so I know but I was dreadfully afraid you werent going to
ask me I am absolutely STARVED



CHAPTER XII


And now continued Miss Colton after an interval during which I
presume she had been waiting for some reply to her frank declaration
concerning mind and appetite what must I do to help Shall I unpack
the basket

I was struggling as we say in Denboro to get the ship under control I
had been taken aback so suddenly that I had lost steerage way My slight
experience with the vagaries of the feminine mind had not prepared me
for the lightning changes of this kind Not two minutes before she had
if one might judge by her look and tone been deeply offended almost
insulted because I refused to permit her wandering off alone into the
woods My invitation to lunch had been given on the spur of the moment
and with no idea that it would be accepted And she not only accepted
but had expected me to invite her had been fearful that I might not do
so She told me so herself

Shall I unpack the basket she repeated She was looking at me
intently and the toe of her riding boot was patting the leaves What is
the matter Are you sorry I am going to stay

It was high time for me to get under way There were squalls on the
horizon

Oh no no I exclaimed hastily Of course not I am delighted But
you need not trouble to help Just let me attend to your horse and I
will have lunch ready in a jiffy

I led Don over to the little green belt of meadow between the trees and
the sand of the beach unbuckled the reins and made him fast to a stout
birch He bent his head and began to pull big mouthfuls of the rich
grass He too was evidently glad to accept my invitation

When I returned to my camping ground I found the basket unpacked and the
young lady arranging the eatables

You shouldnt have done that I said I am the host here

She did not look up Dont bother the table maid she observed
briskly That fire is not kindled yet

I lit the fire and going over to the bushes selected two of the fish
a bass and a pickerel I carried them down to the shore of the pond and
began cleaning them using my jacknife and a flat stone I was nearing
the end of the operation when she came over to watch

Why are you doing that she asked You are not going to cook
themnoware you

I am going to try I replied

But how You havent anything to cook them in

I dont need it You dont appreciate the conveniences of this hotel
Miss Colton There now were ready

I rose washed my hands in the pond and picked up two other flat
stones large ones which I had previously put aside These I carried
to the fire and raking aside the burning logs with a stick laid the
stones in a bed of hot coals

Those are our frying pans I informed her When they are hot enough
they will cook the fish At least I hope they will Now for the
coffee

But she waved me aside The coffee is my affair she said I insist
upon making the coffee Oh you need not look at me like that I am not
altogether useless I studied Domestic Sciencea littlein my prep
school course As much as I studied anything else laughingly

But

Mr Paine I am not on horseback now and you cant hold my bridle as
you did Dons If you will fill the coffee pot and put it on to boil
Thank you I am glad to see that even you obey orders sometimes

I had cooked fish in outofdoor fashion often before but I am quite
sure I never took such pains as I did with these They were not culinary
triumphs even at that but my guest was kind enough to pronounce them
delicious The lunch basket contained two plates but only one knife
and fork These I insisted upon her using and I got on very well
with sharpened sticks and a spoon The coffee waswell it had one
qualification strength

We conversed but little during the meal The young lady said she was too
hungry to talk and I was so confounded with the strangeness of the
whole affair that I was glad to be silent Sitting opposite me eating
Dorindas doughnuts and apple puffs and the fish that I_I_ had cooked
was Big Jim Coltons daughter the automobile girl the heiress the
incarnation of snobbery the young lady whose father I had bidden go
to the devil and to whom in company with the rest of the family I
had many times mentally extended the same invitation And now we were
picnicing together as if we were friends of long standing Why Nellie
Dean could not appear more unpretentious and unconscious of social
differences than this girl today What would her parents say if they
saw us like this What would Captain Jed and the rest of those in
rebellion against the Emperor of New York say That I was a traitor
hand and glove with the enemy Well I was not and I did not intend to
be But for her to

She interrupted my meditations

Mr Paine she observed suddenly you will excuse my mentioning it
but you are distinctly not entertaining You have not spoken a word for
five minutes And you are not attending to my needs The apple puffs are
on your side of thetable

I hastened to pass the paper containing the puffs

I beg your pardon I said hurriedly II was daydreaming I guess

So I imagined I forgive you this lunch would tempt me to forgive
greater sins than yours Did that delightful old housekeeper of yours
cook all these nice things

She did So you think Dorinda delightful do you

Yes She is so sincere and goodhearted And so odd and bright and
funny I could listen to her for hours

Humph Well if you were a member of her household you would have that
privilege often I doubt if her husband considers it such a privilege

Her husband Oh yes I met him He is a character too isnt he

Yes a weak one

She put down her coffee cup and sighed contentedly

I think I never tasted anything so good as this lunch she observed
And Im quite sure I never ate so much at one sitting I am going to
help you clear away but please dont ask me to do it just now Have you
finished You may smoke if you like

I had been longing for a smoke and now I filled my pipe and lighted it

Now we can talk cant we she said I want you to tell me about your
mother How is she

Just as she was when you saw her I answered Mother is always the
same

She is a dear I had heard so many nice things about her and I was
not disappointed I intended to make only a short call and I stayed and
stayed I hope I did not tire her

Not at all Mother enjoyed your call exceedingly

Did she I am so glad I really am I went to your house with a
good deal of misgiving Mr Paine I feared that my coming might be
considered an intrusion

I told you that it would not

I know But under the circumstancesFathers disagreement
withconsidering all thetheOh what shall I call it

The late unpleasantness I suggested

Again came the twinkle in her eye She nodded

Thank you she said That is a quotation but it was clever of you to
think of it Yes considering the late unpleasantness I was afraid
my visit might be misunderstood I was fearful that your mother
orsomeonemight think I came there with an ulterior motive something
connected with that troublesome Lane dispute Of course no one did think
such a thing

She asked the question quickly and with intense seriousness I
remembered Lutes hint and my own secret suspicions but I answered
promptly

Of course not I said

You did not think that did you

No unblushingly

I came because from what I had heard of your mother I was sure she must
be a wonderful woman I wanted to meet her And she IS wonderful and so
patient and sweet and good I fell in love with her Everyone must love
her You should be proud of your mother Mr Paine

I am I answered simply

You have reason And she is very proud of you

Without the reason Im afraid

She did not speak Her silence hurt I felt that I knew what she was
thinking and I determined to make her say it

Without the reason I repeated

I did not say that

But you thought it

My stubborn persistence was a mistake Again as at our meeting in the
grove I had gone too far Her answer was as completely indifferent as
speech and tone could be

Indeed she said coldly It is barely possible that I did not think
about it at all    Now Mr Paine if you are ready shall we clear
away

The clearing most of it was done silently I washed the plates the
coffee pot and other things in the pond and she packed them in the
basket As I returned with the knife and forks I found her looking at
the coffee pot and smiling

What is the matter I asked sulkily I was provoked with myself for
forgetting who and what I was and with her for making me forget Isnt
it clean

Why yes she answered surprisingly so Did they teach Domestic
Science at your college too

I started MY college I repeated How did you know I had been at
college Did Mother tell you

She laughed gleefully

Did Mother tell you I demanded If she did

Well what if she did However she did not But you have told me now
Harvard was it or Yale

I tossed the knife and fork into the basket and turned away

Princeton perhaps suggested Miss Colton

I walked over and began to unjoint my rod I was a fool to be trapped
like this No one in Denboro except Mother and George Taylor knew of my
brief college career and now I had practically told this girl of it
She mightif she were sufficiently interested to remember which
was fortunately not probabletell her father and he might ask other
questions concerning my history Where would those questions lead

I was angrily tugging at the rod when I heard her step behind me I did
not turn

I beg your pardon she said

I pretended not to hear

I beg your pardon Mr Paine she said again

Its all right I muttered No apologies are necessary

I said it like a sullen schoolboy There was another moment of silence
Then I heard her move away I looked over my shoulder She was walking
toward the meadow where Don the horse was picketed There was offended
dignity in every line of her figure

For a moment I fought with my pride and injured selfrespect Then I
hurried after her

Miss Colton I said

Well she neither turned nor stopped

Miss Colton I should not have answered like that I was rude

She stopped You were she said

I know it I am sorry I apologize

No apologies are necessary

Here was tit for tat I did not know what more to say so I said
nothing

Do I understand that you ask my pardon she inquired still without
turning

I do If you will permit me I will explain I

She whirled about and faced me To my astonishment she was smiling once
more

Of course you wont explain she declared I had no right to ask
you about your college But I couldnt help guessing I told you that
I liked puzzles Well say no more about it I have enjoyed this picnic
and I wont have it spoiled Now why are you taking your rod apart

Because I know you want to go home and I am going with you to show you
the way

But I dont have to go yet do I It is not late And I thought perhaps
you would let me see you catch another bass Wont you Please

Once more she had me at a disadvantage I had no desire for more
fishing and I was fearful of further questions but what could I do
And it was not latebut a little past two oclock

So I rigged the rod again and led the way down the shore to the spot
where the sedge extended out into the pond with the lily pads beyond
it She walked beside me Then she seated herself on a fallen tree and
I baited the hook with a lively minnow and cast For some time I got
not even a nibble As I waited she and I talked But now it was I who
questioned

Do you like Denboro I asked

I am beginning to like it very much At first I thought it very dull
but now I am getting acquainted

There are few cottagers and summer people here But in Harniss there is
a large colony Very nice people I believe

Yes I have met some of them But it was not the summer people I meant
I am beginning to know the townspeople and to like some of them I met
that delightful old Captain Warren the other day

He is as good as they make

Indeed he is And I had an interview with another captain Miss Deans
father yesterday We had an interesting encounter

So I should imagine Captain Jed Whew It MUST have been interesting

It was Oh we were very fierce at firstat least he was and I fought
for my side as hard as I could He said Father was a selfish pig for
wanting to close the Lane and I said it was because of its use by the
pigs that he wished to close it

Ha ha How did it end

Oh we agreed to disagree I respect Captain Dean for his fight but
Father will win of course He always does

He wont win this time Miss Colton

Why not Oh I actually forgot I was talking to the head and front of
the opposition So you think he will not win Mr Paine

I am sure of it He cannot close that Lane until I sell it and I shall
not sell

She regarded me thoughtfully her chin upon her hand

It would be odd if he should not after all she said He prides
himself on having his own way It would be strange if he should be
beaten down here after winning so often in New York Your mother
told me something of your feeling in the matter Mr Paine Father has
offered you a good price for the land hasnt he

He has offered me a dozen times what it is worth

Yes He does not count money when he has set his heart upon anything
And you refused

Yes

But Nellie Dean says the town also wished to buy and you refused its
offer too

Yes

You dont seem to care for money either Mr Paine Are all Cape Cod
people so unmercenary Or is it that you all have money enough  
Pardon me That was impolite I spoke without thinking

Oh never mind I am not sensitiveon that point at least

But I do mind And I am sorry I said it And I should like to
understand I see why the townspeople do not want the Lane closed But
you have not lived here always Only a few years so Miss Dean says
She said too that that Mr Taylor the cashier was almost the only
intimate friend you have made since you came Others would like to be
friendly but you will not permit them to be And yet for these
people mere acquaintances you are sacrificing what Father would call a
profitable deal

Not altogether for them I cant explain my feeling exactly I know
only that to sell them out and make moneyand heaven knows I need
moneyat their expense seems to me dead wrong

Then why dont you sell to THEM

I dont know Unless it was because to refuse your fathers offer and
accept a lower one seemed a mean trick too And I wont be bullied into
selling to anyone I guess that is it as much as anything

My how stubborn you must be

I dont know why I have preached this sermon to you Miss Colton your
sympathies in the fight are with your father naturally

Oh no they are not

I almost dropped the rod

Notwith I repeated

Not altogether They are with you just at present If you had soldif
you had given in to Father feeling as you do I should not have any
sympathy with you at all As it is

As it is I asked eagerlytoo eagerly I should have done better to
pretend indifference

As it is she answered lightly I respect you as I would any sincere
fighter for a losing cause And I shall probably feel some sympathy
for you after the cause is lost Excuse my breaking in on your sermon
provided it is not finished butI think you have a bite Mr Paine

I had very much of a bite The minnow on my hook had been forgotten and
allowed to sink to the bottom and a big pout had swallowed it along
with the hook and a section of line I dragged the creature out of the
water and performed a surgical operation resulting in the recovery of
my tackle

There I exclaimed in disgust I think I have had enough fishing
for one day Suppose we call it off Unless you would like to try Miss
Colton

I made the offer by way of a joke She accepted it instantly

May I she cried eagerly I have been dying to ever since I came

Butbut you will get wet

No matter This is an old suit

It did not look old to my countrified eyes but I protested no more
There was a rock a little below where we then were one of the typical
glacial boulders of the Capelying just at the edge of the water and
projecting out into it I helped her up on to this rock and baited her
hook with shrimp

Shall I cast for you I asked

No indeed I can do it thank you

She did and did it well Moreover the line had scarcely straightened
out in the water when it was savagely jerked the pole bent into a
halfcircle and out of the foaming eddy beneath its tip leaped the
biggest bass I had seen that day or in that pond on any day

By George I exclaimed Can you handle him Shall I

She did not look at me but I received my orders nevertheless

Please dont Keep away she said sharply

For nearly fifteen minutes she fought that fish in and out among the
pads keeping the line tight handling him at least as well as I could
have done I ran for the landing net and as she brought her captive up
beside the rock reached forward to use it But she stopped me

No she said breathlessly I want to do this all myself

It took her several more minutes to do it and she was pretty well
splashed when at last with the heavy net dragging from one hand and
the rod in the other she sprang down from the rock Together we bent
over the fish

A fourpounder if he is an ounce said I I congratulate you Miss
Colton

Poor thing she mused I am almost sorry he did not get away He IS a
beauty isnt he Now I am ready to go home

That journey home was a strange experience to me She rode Don and
bore the lunch basket and the net before her on the saddle I walked
alongside carrying the rod boots and the fish in the otherwise empty
bait pail The sunshine streaming through the leaves of the arching
boughs overhead dappled the narrow overgrown paths with shifting
blotches of light and shadow Around us was the deep living green of
the woods the songs of birds the chatter of red squirrels and the
scent of wild honeysuckle And as we moved onward we talkedthat is
she did most of the talking and I listened Yet I must have talked more
than I knew because I remember expressing opinions concerning books
and operas and pictures subjects I had not discussed for years except
occasionally with Mother and then only because she was still interested
in them I seemed somehow to have become a different a younger man
under the influence of these few hours with the girl I had professed to
hate so cordially Our companionshipperfectly meaningless as it was
the mere caprice of an idle day on her parthad rejuvenated me During
that homeward walk I forgot myself entirely forgot that I was Ros
Paine the country loafer forgot too that she was the only child of
the city millionaire that we had or could have nothing in common
She also seemed to forget and we chatted together as unconsciously
and easily as if we had known each other all our lives

Yet it may be that her part in the conversation was not altogether
without a purpose She led me to speak of Denboro and its people of how
they lived and of the old days of sailing ships and deep sea skippers
George Taylors name was mentioned and I praised him highly telling of
his rise from poor boy to successful man as we rated success locally

He manages that bank well I declared Everyone says so And from
what I have seen of his management I know it to be true

How do you know she asked

Because I have had some experience in banking myself I

I stopped short My tongue was running away with me She did not ask the
question which I dreaded and expected Instead she said looking down at
me

You are a loyal friend arent you Mr Paine

I have reason to be loyal to George I answered with feeling

Are you as loyal to yourself

I looked up at her in surprise

What do you mean I asked

I have been trying to understand you Mr Paine Trying to get the
answer to the puzzle In one way I think I have it I understand your
attitude in the Lane affair and I think I know why you came to Denboro
and are staying here

I stopped short Youyou know THAT I cried

I think I do You believe that your mother needs you and you will not
leave her That is your reason for living here I think But in another
way I cannot understand you at all

She spoke to the horse and we moved on again I waited for her to
continue but she was silent

How What is the other way The way in which you cannot understand me
I asked

Shall I tell you Do you wish me to be perfectly frank

Yes

I cannot understand how a man such as you seem to be young educated
and with life before him can be content to do as you do spend your
time in fishing or sailing or shooting To have no ambition at all
My father was a poor country boy like your friend Mr Taylor but he
worked night and day until he became what he is now And even now he
works and works hard Oh I am proud of him Not because he is what he
is but because he has done it all himself If I were a man I would have
some purpose in life I would do SOMETHING worth while if it were only
to sell fish from a cart like that old fellow with the queer namewhat
is itOh yes Theophilus Newcomb

I did not answer She had said all that was necessary and more It was
quite enough for me

There she observed after a moment You asked me to tell you and I
did If you never speak to me again it will be exactly what I deserve
But I thought it and so I said it Expressing my thoughts is one of my
bad habits    Oh why we are almost home arent we

We had come to the edge of the grove bordering Beriah Holts pasture
The grove was on the west side of a little hill Before us the pasture
sloped away to Beriahs house and barn with the road beyond it And
beyond that in the distance were the steeples and roofs of Denboro
Among them the gables and tower of the Colton mansion rose conspicuous
and costly

She turned in the saddle I presume I may leave you now Mr Paine
she said Even you must admit that the rest of the way is plain
sailing Thank you for your hospitality and for your services as guide
I will send the basket and net over by one of the servants

I will take them now I said shortly

Very well if you prefer Here they are

I took them from her

Good afternoon she said And thanks once more for a very pleasant
picnic

You are quite welcome Im sure Thank you for your frank opinion of
myworthlessness It was kind of you to express it

The sarcasm was not lost upon her

I meant it as a kindness she replied

Yes And it was true enough probably Doubtless I shall derive great
benefit from yourwords of wisdom

Her patience evidently was exhausted She turned away Oh that she
said indifferently is your affair I told you what I believed to
be the truth that was all What you do is not likely to be of vast
importance to me one way or the other Come Don

Don cantered down the slope I watched him and his rider disappear
beyond the trees in the distance Then I picked up my pail and other
burdens and followed in their wake The sun was behind a cloud It had
been a strange day with a miserable ending I was furiously angry with
her but I was more angry with myself For what she had told me WAS the
truth and I knew it

I strode on head down through the village People spoke to me asking
what luck I had had and where I had been but I scarcely noticed them
As I reached the Corners and was passing the bank someone called my
name I glanced up and saw George Taylor descending the steps

Hold on Ros he hailed Wait a minute Whats your rush Hold on

I halted reluctantly

Fishing again I see he observed as he reached my side Any luck

Fair I told him

What pond

Seaburys

Go alone

Yes That I had not been alone since was no business of his

Humph You aint exactly what a fellowd call talkative this afternoon
seems to me Anything wrong

No

Tuckered out

I guess so

Well so am I but I aint had your fun getting that way Small and I
have been at it night and day getting things in shape so he could leave
Hes gone Went this noon And that aint the worst of it I havent got
anybody yet to take his place Ill have to be cashier and bookkeeper
too for a spell Theres applicants enough but they dont suit Guess
likely youll have to help me out after all Ros The job is yours if
you say the word

He laughed as he said it Even to him the idea of my working was a joke

But the joke did not seem funny to me just then I walked on for some
distance without a word Then I asked a question

What is expected of a man in that position I asked

Expected Why plain bank bookkeepingnot much else at first Yet
theres a good chance for a likely fellow to be considerable more in
time I need help in my part of the work Thats why I havent hired
any of the dozen or so who are after the place What makes you ask You
dont know of a good man for me do you Ros

When do you want him to begin

Tomorrow morning if he satisfies me

Would I satisfy you

You Humph Try me and see thats all Id ask

All right Ill be on hand in the morning

He stopped looked at me and then seized me by the arm

See here he cried Im lost in the fog I guess likely What do you
mean by that Is it time to laughor what

It may be I dont know But I take the bookkeepers position in your
bank Now goodby Dont talk to me I dont feel like talking

Butbut Ros

Goodby

I walked on I had taken but a few steps when he overtook me

Ros he said I aint going to say but just one thing If you meant
what you said Im the most tickled man on the Cape But you aint asked
a word about the salary

I know it I havent asked because I dont care Ill be on hand in the
morning

I left him standing there and hurried down the Lower Road As I had
said to him I did not feel like talking I did not want even to see any
one I wanted to be let alone But it was fated that I should not be
not yet Sim Eldredge was waiting for me around the corner He stepped
out from behind the fence where he had been hidden

Ros he whispered Ros Paine Wait Its me Sim I want to ask you
somethin Want that George Taylor you was speakin to just now

Yes I answered impatiently What of it

Say Ros you and me aint pulled that Colton trade off but it aint
my fault You aint got no hard feelins against me I know And I want
you to do a little mite of favor for me Will you

What is it If it has anything to do with the Lane I tell you now
that

It aintit aint Its about that bookkeepin job in the bank Henry
Smalls place the one hes just quit Ive got a third cousin name of
Josiah Badger over to South Harniss Hes a smart young chap and an
A1 accountant at figgers Hes been keepin books down at the fish
wharfsee Now hed like that job and bein as you and George are
so thick I callated maybe youd sort of use your influence along of
George andand get it for him There aint nothin in it for methat
is nothin much But I feel friendly toward Josiah and you know I like
to do little kindnesses for folks So

There there I interrupted Its no use Sim I cant help you

Why yes you can

No I cant I dont know your cousin and besideswell you are too
late The place is filled

Sims expression changed He looked surprised and crestfallen

Filled he exclaimed Why no taint If twas Id have known it
wouldnt I Whod you hear had got it Whoever you heard taint so

Yes it is

How do you know Who is it then

I hesitated Before noon of the next day every soul in Denboro would
have heard the news Eldredge might as well hear it now

Ive taken the place myself I said

You Sim actually forgot to whisper he shouted the word YOU Ha
ha ha Ros quit your foolin

Im not fooling I go to work in the bank tomorrow morning

ButOh my soul You Aw I know better Say Ros dont lets waste
time like this Funs all right but    My heavens to Betsy YOU work
for a livin If I believed that Id believe anything Tell me now Who
has got that job    Why dont you answer me

I answered him Shut up I said fiercely Then I vaulted the fence
and set out for home across lots

I heard the next day that Sim went back to the postoffice and informed
the gathering there that Ros Paine had taken to drinking

He was tight as a biled owl declared Sim and uglydont talk
Wanted to fight me because I wouldnt believe he was goin to work Him
What in the everlastin would HE want to work for My heavens to Betsy



CHAPTER XIII


I think Taylor was almost as surprised as Eldredge had been when at
halfpast eight the following morning I appeared at the bank He was
already at his desk and when he looked up and saw me he whistled

Whew he exclaimed So I didnt dream it after all Youre here
aint you

I am here I answered opening the gate and stepping in behind the
rail

Going to take it back and say you never said it

No

Come to go to work Really

That is my intention unless you have changed your mind

Not me It aint likely But Ros Isit down a minute and lets talk
What are you doing this for

It was a question I had been asking myself at intervals during a
restless night Now I gave the only truthful answer

I dont know I said

You dont know

No And I dont seem to care Suppose we dont talk about it I am
here and I am ready to begin work Thats enough isnt it

Why no not quite Youre not doing it just to help me out

No

You dont need to work Youve got money enough

No I havent But money isnt my reason I havent any reason Now
show me the books will you

Dont be in a hurry What does your mother think about it

I havent told her yet Time enough for that when I know that I really
mean it and you know that I am competent to fill the position George
if you keep on crossexamining me I am likely to quit before I begin I
dont know why I am doing this but just now I think I am going to do it
if I can However I am not sure So you had better be careful

Humph What did you catch up at that pond yesterday I never saw a
days fishing make such a difference in a man in my life    All
right Ros All right I wont pester you Too glad to have you here for
that Now about the salary

Before we speak of that there is one more point How about your
directors Dean and the rest Do they know you offered me the position

Sure thing They put the whole affair in my hands Theyll be
satisfied And as for Capn Jedwhy he was the one that suggested
hiring you in the first place

Captain Jed Captain Jed Dean HE suggested it

Yup In a way he did You may not know it Ros but youve made a good
deal of a hit with the old man He aint been used to having anybody
stand up to him as you have As a general thing Denboro jumps when he
snaps the whip You didnt and he couldnt understand why He is the
kind that respects anything they cant understand Then too Nellie
likes you and shes his idol you know Ah hum

He sighed and for a moment seemed to forget me altogether I reminded
him by another question

But why should the captain think of me for this place I asked Why
should he dream that I would take it I gave you no encouragement

I dont know as he did dream it But he and I were speaking of you and
he said hed like to do something to show you what the town thought of
your holding out against Colton That tickled him down to the keel I
said youd be a firstclass helper to me in this bank that I heard you
knew something about banking

George

Its all right I only mentioned that I heard rumors that you were in a
city bank somewhere at one time He didnt ask any more and I shouldnt
have told him if he had But the idea pleased him I could see that
Why dont you try to get him says he Maybe the days of miracles
aint past Perhaps even hed condescend to work if the right job came
his way

So thats what you call his suggesting me do you Humph

Well I told him about it last night when I was up to see Nellie
and he was pleased as Punch Surprised of course but pleased Hes
practically the whole board as far as settling things is concerned so
it is all right He aint the worst friend youve got by a long shot

I imagined that I understood what Captain Jeds friendship meant My
accepting the bank position was one more bond binding me to his side in
the Shore Lane battle And so long as I was under Taylors eye and his
own I could not be subject to the Colton influence

George and I discussed the question of salary if his offer and my
prompt acceptance might be called a discussion The pay was not large
to begin with but it was more than I had a right to expect And I was
perfectly honest when I said that money was not the consideration which
led me to make the sudden change in my habit of life I was sick of
idleness I had longed for something to occupy my life and time I might
as well be doing this as anything Taylors offer had appealed to me
when he first made it these were the excuses I evolved for my own
satisfaction and I tried to believe them real But one reason I would
not admit even in my thoughts as a possibility It was not that
girl or anything she had said which influenced me No over and over
againno

Sam Wheeler the young fellow who acted as assistant bookkeeper and
messenger came in and Taylor after showing me the books and giving
me a few hints as to what my duties would be turned me over to him for
further instruction I found I needed but little The pages with their
rows of figures seemed like old friends I almost enjoyed poring over
them Was it possible that I was going to like this new venture of mine

Before noon I was fairly certain of it The work in a country bank is
different from that in the large city institutions in that it is by no
means as specialized I found that later on I should be expected
to combine the work of teller with that of bookkeeper And this
too seemed natural I worked as steadily as I could considering
interruptions and the forenoon was over almost before I knew it

The interruptions however were numerous and annoying some of them
too were amusing Depositors came saw me behind the bars of the
window and after expressing their astonishment demanded to know what
I was doing there If I had answered all the questions put to me by the
curious Denboroites I should have found time for little else But Taylor
helped me by shooing the curious ones away Dont bother the new hand
he said If you want to know particulars ask me Anything I dont tell
you you can read in next weeks Item This is a bank not a question
box

Captain Elisha Warren came in and was as surprised as the rest After an
interview with the cashier he returned to my window and requested me to
open up When I did so he reached in a big hand and seized mine

Shake Ros he said heartily Im glad for the bank and Im gladder
still for you Come hard at fust does it

A little I confessed Not as hard as I expected though

Fust day or two out of port is always the toughest Youll get your sea
legs on pretty soon Then youll be glad you shipped I callate

I hope so I answered rather dubiously

I know you will Theres nothin so tiresome as doin nothin I know
because thats been my job for quite a spell Seems sometimes as if Id
have a fit I get so sick of loafin

His idea of a loaf was rising at six and weeding his garden
superintending the labor on his cranberry swamps or about his barns and
grounds attending bank and Selectmens meetings and generally keeping
busy until sunset

I tell Abbie my housekeeper he continued that if twant for my
age I believe Id go to sea again just to keep from fallin apart with
dry rot I asked her if shed noticed how my timbers creaked and she
said I didnt keep still long enough for her to notice anything Ho ho
Nothin makes her more provoked than for me to mention gettin old or
goin to sea All the same I envy you your youth Ros Youve got your
life afore you and Im glad to see that youre goin to make somethin
of it I always said youd wake up if somebody give you a punch Who
punched you Ros

My reply was noncommittal

Better mind my own business hadnt I he observed All right
I will No offense meant you understand But you see Ive never
believed that work was the cuss of mankind like some folks and no
matter how much money a young fellers got I think hes better off doin
somethin Thats the gospel accordin to Elisha Well good luck and a
pleasant vyage See you again soon Say turning back keep an eye on
George will you Folks in love are lble to be absentminded they tell
me and I should not want him to be absent with any of my money Hear
that do you George

Taylor who was standing near laughed and walked away A moment later
I saw him looking out of the window with the same strange expression on
his face which I had noticed several times before when his approaching
marriage was hinted at Something was troubling him that was plain He
loved Nellie devotedly I knew yet he obviously did not like to hear
the marriage mentioned

Sim Eldredge was one of the first visitors to the bank but his visit
was a short one He entered the door walked straight to the tellers
window and peered through the bars I heard him catch his breath

Good morning Sim said I What can I do for you

Do he repeated Do for me Nothinnothin special Youyou
meant it then

I told you I did

My soul was all the answer he made Then he turned and walked out

At about eleven oclock I was halfway through the addition of a
column of figures when I heard some one say Well by time with such
anguished fervor that it was almost like a prayer for help I looked up
Lute Rogers was staring in at me openmouthed and horrorstricken

Hello Lute I said

Lute swallowed hard

They told me twas so he stammered They said so andand I laughed
at em Ros you aint be you

What

Goin to stay in there andand take Henrys job

Yes

You be And you never said nothin to nobody To Dorinda Or even
Comfort

No not yet

Nor to me To ME by time You let them fellers at the store make a
fool of me

No one could do that Lute I have told you so often

And you let them know it afore I did And me livin right in the house
with you By time II

There there Lute dont cry Ill tell you all about it when I come
home for dinner

Yes I should think you might do that much Treatin your own family
likewhy did you tell Sim Eldredge

Sim asked me and so I told him that was all Dont stand there
fidgeting Run along home theres a good fellow Mr Taylor has his eye
on you already

Lute glanced apprehensively toward the cashiers desk and turned to go

Well he exclaimed Ive said you was crazy moren once thats some
satisfaction Say can I tell em to home

I hesitated You may tell Dorinda if you like I answered But I
prefer to tell Mother myself

George rose from his desk just then and Lute hurried to the door I
smiled I imagined his arrival in our kitchen and how he would explode
the sensational news upon his unsuspecting wife

But I was not altogether calm though I did my best to appear so when
I entered that kitchen at a quarter past twelve Lute was seated in a
chair by the window evidently watching and waiting He sprang up as I
entered

Set down ordered Dorinda who was taking a clam pie from the oven
She merely nodded when I came in Dorinda often spoke in meeting against
sinful pride yet she had her share of pride sinful or not She would
not ask questions or deign to appear excited not she

But Dorinda cried her husband its Ros Dont you see

You set down Lute Rogers Well turning to me dinners ready if
you are

I shall be in a few minutes I answered I want to see Mother first

Breaking the news to Mother was a duty which I dreaded But it turned
out to be not dreadful at all Mother was surprised of course but she
did not offer a single objection Her principal feeling seemed to be
curiosity as to my reasons for the sudden change

Of course Roscoe if you are happier I shall be too she said
I know it must have been very dull for you here My conscience has
troubled me not a little all these years I realize that a man a young
man like you needs an interest in life he wants something more than
the care and companionship of a useless creature like me

Mother how often have I told you not to speak like that

But he does Many times when you and I have been here together I have
been on the point of urging you to leave me and go back to the world and
take your place in it More than once you remember dear I have hinted
at such a thing but you have always chosen not to understand the hints
and I have been so weak and selfish that I have not pressed them I am
glad you have done this if it seems right to you But does it Are you
sure

I think so Mother I confess I am not sure

This country bank is a pretty small place isnt it Not big enough for
my boy to prove his worth in

It is quite big enough for that That doesnt require a Rothschilds
establishment

But your decision must have been a very sudden one You did not mention
that you thought of such a thing Not even to me

It was sudden I answered I took the position on the spur of the
moment

But why What led you to do it

I dont know Mother

What influenced you Has any one urged you

George Taylor offered me the place some time ago He urged me

No one else

I avoided the issue You dont mind then Mother I said You are
willing that I should try the experiment

I am glad if it pleases you And you must let me say this now Roscoe
because it is true and I mean it If another and better opportunity
comes to you one that might take you away from Denboroand from
mefor a time of course I want you to promise me that you will not
refuse it on my account Will you promise

No Of course I shant promise any such thing Is it likely that I
would leave you Mother

I know that you would not leave me unless I were willing for you to
go I know that Roscoe But I am much better and stronger than I was I
shall never be well

Dont say that I interrupted hastily

But I must say it because it is true I shall never be well but I am
strong enough now to bear the thought of your leaving me and when the
time comes I shall insist upon your doing so I am glad we have had this
talk dear I am glad too that you are going to be busy once more in
the way you like and ought to be You must tell me about your work every
day Now go because your dinner is ready and of course you must be
getting back to the bank Kiss me Boy

And as I bent over her she put her arms about my neck

Boy she whispered I know there is some reason for your doing this
a reason which you have not told me You will tell me some day wont
you

I straightened hurriedly and tried to laugh Of course Ill tell you
Mother I replied If there is anything to tell

The clam pie was on the table in the diningroom and Dorinda was seated
majestically before it Lute was fidgeting in his chair

Here he is he exclaimed as I joined the pair at the table Ros how
did you ever come to do it

His wife squelched him as usual If Roscoes got anything to tell
she observed with dignity hell tell it without your help or anybody
elses If he aint he wont This pies colder than it ought to be
but that isnt my fault

As I ate I told them of my sudden determination to become a laboring
man I gave the reasons that I had given Mother

Umhm said Dorinda

But I cant understand pleaded Lute You dont need to work and
Ive sort of took a pride in your not doin it If I was welloff same
as you be I bet George Taylord have to whistle afore I wore out MY
brains in his old bank

He wouldnt have time to whistle moren once was Dorindas comment

Now Dorinda what kind of talk is that Wouldnt have time to whistle
You do say more things without any sense to em Just talk to hear
yourself I callate What are you grinnin at Roscoe

I cant imagine Lute This clam pie is a triumph May I have another
helping Dorinda

Dorinda did not answer but the second helping was a liberal one She
was so quiet and the glances she gave me from time to time were so odd
that I began to feel uneasy I was fairly sure that she approved of my
new venture but why did she look at me like that

Well said I looking at my watch and rising what do you think of
it Am I doing right

Lute leaned back in his chair Theres considerble to be said on that
subject he announced Work as a general thing I consider all right
Ive told you that afore But when it comes to

What do you think Dorinda I interrupted

Dorinda stirred her tea

Think she repeated I think    Whens that Colton girl comin to
call on Comfort again

I had taken my hat from the hook Now with it in my hand I turned and
faced her

How should I know that I demanded Thats a trifle off the subject
isnt it

Umhm said Dorinda Maybe tis

I went out hurriedly

Within the week I was at home in my new position The strangeness of
regular hours and regular employment wore away with surprising rapidity
There were of course mornings when sea and sky and the freshness of
outdoors tempted me and I wondered whether or not I had been foolish
to give up my fine and easy life But these periods of temptation were
shorter and less frequent as I became more and more familiar with my
duties and with the routine of the bank I found myself taking a greater
interest in the institution and to my astonishment I was actually
sorry when Saturday came It seemed odd enough to once more have money
in my pocket which I had earned It was not a great amount of course
but I felt it to be mine Yes there was no doubt about it I had done
the right thing and was glad I was grateful to Taylor for having given
me the opportunity Perhaps I should have been grateful to the person
whose brutal and impertinent frankness had piqued me into grasping that
opportunity but I was not

She made her second call upon Mother two days after our impromptu picnic
at Seaburys Pond I heard all about it when I came home that afternoon
It appeared that she had brought more flowers and a fresh supply of
books She had remained even longer than on her first visit and she
and Mother had talked about almost everything under the sun One topic
however had not been discussed a fact which my guarded questions made
certain She like myself had said nothing concerning the day in the
woods

I told her of your consenting to help Mr Taylor in his dilemma said
Mother

Did you said I It was kind of you to put it in that way

That was the truthful way of putting it wasnt it She seemed very
much interested

Indeed And surprised I presume

Why yes I think so She seemed surprised at first then she laughed
I could not understand why She has a very pleasant laugh hasnt she

I have never noticed This was untrue

She has She is a charming girl I am sorry you were not here when she
called I told her you would be home soon and asked her to wait but she
would not

I am glad she didnt

Roscoe

I am Mother That young lady comes here to see you merely because she
has nothing else to do just now I shouldnt accept too many favors from
her

Mother said I was unreasonable and prejudiced and I did not argue the
point Lute and Dorinda discussed the caller at the supper table until I
was constrained to leave the room Mabel Colton might amuse herself with
Mother and the two members of our household whom she had described as
characters she might delude them into believing her thoughtful and
sympathetic and without false pride but I knew better She had insulted
me She had in so many words told me that I was lazy and worthless
just as she might have told her chauffeur or one of the servants That
it was true made no difference Would she have spoken in that way toto
Victor Carver for instance Hardly She was just what I had thought
her at first a feminine edition of Victor with more brains than he
possessed

Captain Jed Dean came into the bank the third day after my installation
as bookkeeper and teller I was alone in the directors room going
over some papers and he entered and shook hands with me The old fellow
professed delight at my presence there

George tells me youre takin hold fustrate he said Thats good
Im glad to hear it

Why I asked There was a trace of his old pomposity in the speechor
I imagined there wasand I chose to resent it These were the days when
I was in the mood to resent almost anything

Why he repeated in surprise What do you mean

Why are you glad I said I cant see what difference it makes to you
whether I succeed or not

He regarded me with a puzzled expression but instead of taking
offense he laughed

Youve got a chip on your shoulder aint you Ros he observed
Workin you too hard at the start are we

No I answered curtly

Then what is the matter

Why nothing unless it is that everyone I meet seems to take such
a great interest in my being here I believe all of Denboro talks of
nothing else

Not much else I shouldnt wonder But thats to be expected aint it
Everybodys glad youre makin good

Humph They all seem to regard that as the eighth wonder of the world
The position doesnt require a marvel of intelligence almost any one
with a teaspoonful of brains could fill it

Why no they couldnt But thats nothin to do with it I see whats
the matter with you Ros You think all hands are knocked on their beam
ends because youve gone to work Some of em are thats a fact and
you cant blame em much considerin how long youve lived here without
doin anything But all of em that amount to a threecent piece are
glad and the rest dont count anyway Youve made a good many friends
in this town lately son

I smiled bitterly Friends I said

Why yes friends And friends are worth havin especially if you
make em without beggin for their friendship I give in that youve
surprised some of us We didnt know that you had it in you But your
standin up to old Colton was a fine thing and we appreciated it

That is because you were against his grabbing the Lane

What of it And twant that altogether I for one aint complainin
because you stood up to me and wouldnt sell to the town By the way
Tim Hallets gang havent bothered you lately have they

No And I advise them not to

He chuckled I heard you advised em to that effect he said I aint
complainin at that either even though I knew what they was up to and
thought twas more or less of a joke But I liked the way you fired em
out of there not carin a tinkers darn who was behind em So long as
a man stands square in his boots and dont knuckle to anybody he wont
lose anything with Jed Dean Thats me

You ought to like Colton then I said He hasnt knuckled much

Captain Jed grinned Well he said slowly I dont object to that in
him He seems to be a fighter and thats all right Maybe if I was one
of his tribe in New York I should like him But I aint And you aint
Ros Were both of us country folks livin here and hes a city shark
buttin into the feedin grounds He wants to hog the whole place and
you and I say he shant Im thankful to him for one thing his comin
here has waked you up and its goin to make a man of you or I miss my
guess

I did not answer

You mustnt get mad because I talk this way he went on Im old
enough to be your dad Ros Paine and I know what Im talkin about I
never took much of a shine to you in the old days You was too much of
what the story books call a gentleman to suit me Ive had to scratch
all my life for what Ive got but Ive got it When a young able
feller like you was contented to loaf around as you did and take no
interest in nothin I naturally figgered he was noaccount I see
now I was wrong All you needed was somethin to stir you up and set you
goin KEEP goin thats my advice to you And so long as you do and
dont bend when the pressure gets hard youll be somebody afore you
die And the friends youve madell stand back of you

How about the enemies I have made

Enemies I suppose likely you have made some enemies but what of it
Ive made enemies all my life It aint because Im popular here in
Denboro that Im what I am Now is it

The truthful answer would have been no Captain Dean was not popular
but he was respected even by the many who disliked and disagreed with
him I hesitated trying to think what to say

You know taint that he said Popularity I never had though its
a pleasant enough thing and sometimes I wishBut there this aint
experience meetin Im glad youre here in this bank Youre smart and
George says you are worth more than Henry Small ever was even so early
If you really are what it begins to look as if you are Im glad for
Denboro Maybe therell be somebody besides George fit to run this town
after Im gone

I smiled The last remark was so characteristic that it was funny He
was turning away but he noticed the smile and turned back

Thats a joke hey he asked

Captain I said you are not consistent When you and I first talked
about the Lane you said that you would not blame me if I closed it If
it was yours you wouldnt have Tom Dick and Harry driving fish carts
through it

Did I say that

Yes And you said on another occasion that anyone would sell anything
if they were offered money enough

Humph Well sometimes I say most anything but my prayers Matildy
says I forget them pretty often but I tell her her Friday night
speeches are long enough to make up Maybe I meant what I said to you at
those times Ros I shouldnt wonder if I did But twas a lie just the
same There are things I wouldnt sell of course Nellie my daughters
one of em Shes goin to get a good husband in George here but
her happiness means more to me than money Shes one of the things I
wouldnt sell And my Selectmans job is another I fought for that
not so much for the honor or whatever you call it but becausewell
because I wanted to show em that I could get it if I set out to I
dont presume likely you can understand that feelin

I think I can I answered Mr Colton gave about the same reason for
his determination to close the Lane You and he seem to be a good deal
alike after all

He looked at me from beneath his bushy brows His mouth twisted in a
grim smile

Say son he said if I hadnt been so free with my proclamations
about bein your friend you and me would have a settlement for that
little bit of talk The Emperor and me alike Ugh

The next afternoon he came in again and asked me to step outside the
railing He had something to say to me he declared

We sat down together on the settee by the wall

Ros he said in a low tone have you had any new offer for your
property Not from Colton or the town but from anybody else

No I answered What do you mean

You aint heard anything from a Boston firm claimin to represent the
Bay Shore Development Company or some such

No What sort of a company is that

I dont know that is I dont know much about it But theres talk
driftin round that a Boston syndicate is callatin to buy up all the
shore front land from South Ostable to the Bayport line and open it up
for summer house lots The name is the Bay Shore Development Company or
somethin like that You aint heard from em then

Not a word Where did your information come from

From nobody in particular It just seems to be in the air Alvin Baker
heard it over to Ostable The feller that told him got it from somebody
else who got it from another somebody and so on Theres talk about
good prices bein offered and accordin to Alvin Ostable folks are
pretty excited Elnathan Mullet who owns that strip below your house
knows somethin about it I think I shouldnt wonder if hed had an
offer or a hint or somethin But Elnathans mouth shuts tighter than
a muskrat trap and I couldnt get nothin out of him He just looked
knowin and that was all But if its so it may mean a heap to
Denboro

I was considering the news when he spoke again

It might mean a lot to you Ros he whispered

How so

Why this way If this concern offered you enough money you might sell
out to them mightnt you Sell all your place I mean you could
get another one easy enough You aint particular about livin by the
shore

Butyou urge me to SELL I exclaimed Sell the Shore Lane with the
rest

Why not You wouldnt be sellin to Colton And if this development
scheme is what they say it is therell be roads cut through all along
shore The town could use any of em at least that arrangement might be
made Think it over Ros If they do offer and offer enough Id sell
if I was you Say that would be a reef under His Majestys bows hey
Jolt him some I callate

I did not answer This was a new possibility Of course his reason for
advising my selling was plain enough but leaving the Coltons entirely
aside the idea was not without allurement The towns convenience
in the matter of a road might be considered just as he said And my
scruples against selling at a profit were after all based upon that
feature

You think it over he counseled Dont say nothin to nobody but
just thinkand wait Ill keep my eye to windard and see what I
can find out I tell you honest Ros Ill feel safer when I know old
Imperials games blocked for good and all

Old Imperial himself made his appearance before closing hours I looked
up from my work to see him standing by the window He had not expected
to see me thereevidently his daughter had not considered Mothers news
of sufficient importance to repeatand at first he did not recognize
me

Good afternoon Mr Colton said I

He nodded Cash this for me will you he said pushing a check
through the opening What Hello What in blazes are you doing in
there

I am employed here now I answered

Humph how long since

Ten days or such matter

What are you doing in a bank

Banking was my business at one time

Thought you hadnt any business

I havent had any for some years Now I have How do you wish this
money In tens and fives

Yes Nothing bigger Down here it restricts the circulation if you
spring a twenty dollar bill on them So youve taken to banking I was
thinking of corraling you for a gunning trip one of these days Now its
all off I suppose

It looks that way Sorry I am to be deprived of the pleasure

Humph Then with one of his sudden changes How big a business does
this concern do What do your deposits amount to

I gave him the figures as printed in the yearly statement He made no
comment Instead he observed You havent been around to accept that
offer of mine yet Paine

Not yet I answered

Suppose I ought to raise it now that youre a financier yourself
However I shant

I havent asked you to

He smiled No you havent he said Well it is openfor a while
If I were you Id accept it pretty soon

Possibly

Meaning that I am not you hey Im not I havent your high
principles Paine Cant afford em Youre what they call a
Progressive in politics too arent you

Here is your money I said ignoring the question

Ill bet you are he declared taking the bills I never saw one of
you highprincipled chaps yet that wasntuntil he got rich enough to
be something else Progress is all right maybe but I notice that you
fellows pay for it and the rest of us get it Just as I am going to get
that land of yours

You havent got it yet I said serenely I had made up my mind that
this time he should not provoke me into losing my temper

He seemed to divine my determination His eye twinkled Youre
improving Paine he observed Ill give you a piece of advice it has
cost me a good deal to learn but Ill give it to you Dont ever let
the other fellow make you mad

I remembered our first interview and I could not resist the temptation
to retort

If my recollection is correct I said you forgot that the first time
we met

He laughed aloud So I did he admitted Maybe if I hadnt it would
not cost me so much to get my own way in your case

He walked out of the building I heard one exclamation from behind and
turning saw Sam Wheeler my youthful assistant staring at me

Mygosh exclaimed Sam his tone a mixture of wonder and admiration
I dont see how you dast to talk back to him like that Ros Hell sic
thethe System onto you wont he

It was evident that Sam had been reading the magazines

I heard no more from Captain Jed and nothing from the mysterious
Development Company for the remainder of that week But on Sunday as
I sat in the boat house smoking my after dinner pipe and reading Lute
excitedly entered followed by a welldressed smoothshaven man of
middle age whom he introduced as Mr Keene of Boston whos driven all
the way from Ostable apurpose to see you Ros

Mr Keene shook hands with me cordially and apologized for intruding
upon my day of rest He intended returning to the city in the morning
he said and as he had a little matter to discuss with me had taken
the liberty of calling I shant take more than half an hour of your
time Mr Paine he explained At least I feel certain that you and I
can reach an agreement in that period If I might be alone with you

This hint evidently intended for Lutes benefit was quite lost upon
the last named individual who had seated himself on the edge of the
work bench and was listening with both ears I was obliged to tell
him that his presence was superfluous and request his returning to the
house which he reluctantly did moving slowly and looking back with
an expression of grieved disappointment After he had gone I asked Mr
Keene what his little matter might be

His reply was prompt and to the point He gave me his card He was it
seemed junior partner in the firm of Barclay and Keene real estate
brokers and promoters Milk Street Boston And just now he was acting
as representative of the Bay Shore Development Company A concern of
which in spite of all our precautions and attempts at secrecy you may
perhaps have heard Mr Paine he added smiling

I admitted that I had heard rumors concerning the companys existence
But except for these very vague rumors I knew nothing about it

He expected that he said and was glad to give me further and complete
information In fact that was his reason for coming so many miles to
see me If I would be good enough to listen he would tell me just what
the Bay Shore Company was and what it contemplated doing

I listened and he talked According to him the Bay Shore syndicatethat
is what it was a syndicate of capitalistsrepresented one of the
biggest real estate propositions ever conceived Those behind it were
awake to the possibilities of the Cape as a summer resort Shore land
water front property in the vicinity was destined to increase in value
provided it was properly exploited and developed The companys idea was
to do just thatexploit and develop

Weve been quietly looking about he continued and are all ready for
the preliminaries And naturally the first preliminary is to secure the
land to develop You have some of that land Mr Paine We know just how
much as we do the holdings of every other party we have approached
or intend to approach I am here to get your figures and if possible
conclude the purchase of your property this afternoon It is Sunday
of course he added with a goodhumored laugh and contracts signed
today are not legal but we can make a verbal contract and the papers
may be signed later I will defer my departure until the afternoon train
tomorrow for that purpose Now name your figure Mr Paine

Of course I had guessed what was coming If I intended to sell at all
here was my opportunity to do soto as Captain Jed expressed it
block Coltons game without sacrificing the principle for which I had
fought and make a good bit of money for myself Another home near by
could be secured I had no doubt and to it Mother might be safely and
easily moved Yet I hesitated to express even a qualified willingness

You appear to be certain that I will sell I observed Isnt that
taking a good deal for granted Mr Keene

He smiledin fact he smiled almost too often to please me There is
such a thing as being too cordial and goodnatured and he was so very
friendly on short acquaintance

I understand he said I have heard about you Mr Paine This
however is a different matter We are not hogs Mr Paine but business
men If our plans go through Denboro will be grateful to us and to
you

IF they go through I thought you were certain of their going through

Certainly certainly There is of course an if in all human plans
but our particular if is a small one I hope you will name your figure
now at once Dont be afraid We are disposed to be liberal And
understand this is entirely a cash transaction You shall have the
money in one hand as you sign the contract with the other Ha ha What
is the price to be

But I would not name a price I seemed to feel as unreasonably reluctant
to close with the Bay Shore Development Company as I had been with
Captain Jed or Colton

Shall I make a bid asked Keene

No not yet at any rate Tell me this Whose land have you already
bought

He shook his head That of course he said with the same gracious
smile I can hardly tell even to you Some of the deals are not yet
closed and as a business man yourself Mr Paine you

I am not a business man I interrupted impatiently At least not
much of a one You say there are capitalists behind your scheme Who are
they

He laid his hand on my knee Why that he said is a secret no
one is supposed to know Menfinanciers such as we are proud to
servepermit their names to be known only when the corporation is ready
to begin actual operations That is natural enough If I were to
mention nameswell some of your Yankee neighbors would want to become
millionaires before selling

There was truth in this I imagine that he guessed he had made an
impression for he went on to shout his praises of the company and the
greatness of its plan He talked and talked in fact he talked too much
I did not like to hear him I did not like HIM that was the trouble He
was too smooth and voluble altogether And he made a mistake in patting
my knee

Very well said I rising from my chair Ill think it over

He was plainly disappointed I dont wish to hurry you of course he
said not moving from his chair but we are anxious to close This is
to be cash remember and I stand ready to make an offer I am sure we
can reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides Mr Paine

Perhaps but I prefer to think the matter over before naming a price or
hearing your offer

As a matter of fact I did not intend to sell or consider selling until
I had discussed the whole affair with Mother But there was no need to
tell him that

I am sorry I confess he said I hoped this particular deal might be
closed We have so many of these little details Mr Paine and time
is money However if you insist upon it I presume the company will be
willing to wait a few days

I am afraid it will have to

Very well very well I shall be down again in a day or two Of course
waiting may have some effect upon the price Today I was empowered to
   You dont care to hear Very well So glad to have met you Mr
Paine Of course you will not mention the subject of our interview to
anyone Business secrets you know Thank you thank you And I will see
you againThursday shall we say

I refused to say Thursday principally because he had said it first I
suggested Saturday instead He agreed shook hands as if I were an old
friend from whom he parted with regret and left me

No I did not like Mr Keene He was too polite and too familiar And
as I thought over his words the whole prospectus of the Bay Shore
Development Company seemed singularly vague The proposal to buy my land
was definite enough but the rest of it was apparently very much in
the air There was too much secrecy about it No one was to tell anyone
anything I was glad I had insisted upon time for consideration I
intended to consider thoroughly



CHAPTER XIV


When I left the boat house I did not go directly home but wandered
along the beach I had puzzled my brain with Mr Keene and his
errand until I determined not to puzzle it any longer that day If my
suspicions were unfounded and existed merely because of my dislike of
the Bay Shore Companys representative then they were not worth worry
If they were well founded I had almost a week in which to discover the
fact I would dismiss the whole matter from my thoughts The question
as to whether or not I would sell the land at all to anybody which was
after all the real question I resolved to put off answering until I
had had my talk with Mother

I walked on by the waters edge until I reached the Lane turning into
that much coveted strip of territory I continued until I came opposite
the Colton mansion where turning again I strolled homeward by the
path through the grove Unconsciously my wandering thoughts strayed to
Mabel Colton It was here that I had met her on two occasions I had an
odd feeling that I should meet her here again that she was here now
I had no reason for thinking such a thing certainly the wish was not
father to the thought but at every bend in the path as the undergrowth
hid the way I expected as I turned the corner to see her coming
toward me

But the path was save for myself untenanted I was almost at its end
where the pines and bushes were scattering and the field of daisies now
in full bloom began when I heard a slight sound at my left I looked
in the direction of the sound and saw her She was standing beneath a
gnarled mossdraped old pine by the bluff edge looking out over the
bay

I stopped involuntarily Then I moved on again as noiselessly as I
could But at my first step she turned and saw me I raised my hat
She bowed coldly so it seemed to my supersensitive imagination and
I replaced the hat and continued my walk I thought I heard the bushes
near which she stood rustle as if she had moved but I did not look
back

Then close behind me I heard her voice

Mr Paine she said

I turned She had followed me and was standing in the path a bit out
of breath as if she had hurried I waited for her to speak but she did
not

Good afternoon Miss Colton I said awkwardly Some one had to speak
we could not stand staring at each other like that

She said Good afternoon also Then there was another interval of
silence

Youyou wished to speak to me I stammered

I DID speak to you with significant emphasis on the did I thought
you might possibly be interested to know that Don and I reached home
safely the other day

Considering that she had called upon Mother since it seemed to me
that my knowledge of her reaching home safely might have been taken for
granted but I said

I am very glad to hear it Miss Colton

We had no difficulty in finding the way after you left us

The way being almost straight and over the main traveled roads this
too was fairly obvious

I felt sure you would have no troubleafter I left you I answered
with a significant emphasis of my own

She did not reply and as I had nothing further to say I waited for her
to continue or to break off the interview She did neither but stood
as if irresolute looking down and stirring with her foot the leaves at
the edge of the path Suddenly she looked up

Mr Paine she said you are making it hard for me to say what I
intended But I think I should say it and so I will I beg your pardon
for speaking as I did when I last saw you I had no right to judge or
criticize you none whatever

You do not need to apologize Miss Colton What you told me was
probably true enough

The conventional answer to this would have been a halfhearted denial of
my statement I presume I expected something of the sort But this girl
was not conventional

Yes she said thoughtfully I think it was If I had not thought so
I should not have said it But that makes no difference You and I are
strangers almost and I had no right to speak as I did I am impulsive
I know it and I often do and say things on impulse which I am sorry for
afterward I offended you

Oh no no I put in hurriedly She had offended me but this frank
confession touched me more than the offense had hurt She was doing a
hard thing and doing it handsomely

Yes I offended you she repeated firmly I have considered the
matter a good deal since then and it seems to me that you were right to
feel offended You had been very kind to me on several occasions and I
had been yourwith a half smileyour guest that day I should not
have hurt your feelings Will you accept my apology

Why yes of course since you insist Miss Colton

Thank you

She was turning to go and I could not let her go thus Although she had
apologized for speaking her thought she had not retracted the thought
itself I was seized with a desire for justification in her eyes I
wanted to explain forgetting for the moment that explanations were
impossible

Miss Colton I said impulsively

Yes

May Imay I say a word

Certainly if you wish

She turned again and faced me

Miss Colton II I began and paused

Well she said patiently What is it

Miss Colton I blundered on you should not have apologized You were
right Your estimate of me was pretty nearly correct I realized that
when you gave it and I have been realizing it ever since I deserved
what I gotperhaps But I should not wish you to thinkthat is
Iwell I had reasons they seemed to me reasons for being what I
waswhat I am I doubt if they were altogether good reasons I am
inclined now to think they were not But I had come to think them good
You see II

I stopped face to face with the fact that I could not give those
reasons to her or any one else She was looking at me expectantly and
with so it seemed to me an expression of real almost eager interest
I faltered tried to go on and then surrendered absolutely to the
hopelessness of the situation

It is no use I said I cant tell you what those reasons were

I turned as I said it I did not care to see her expression change I
knew what she must be thinking and I had no desire to read the thought
in her eyes I stood there waiting for her to leave in disgust

I cant tell you I repeated stubbornly

Very well Her tone was as coldly indifferent as I had anticipated
Was that all you wished to say to me Mr Paine

Miss Colton I should like to explain if I could But I cannot

Pray dont trouble yourself I assure you I had no intentions of asking
for yourreasons Good afternoon

I heard her skirts brush the leaves at the border of the path She was
going and the contemptuous slur at my reasons proved that she did not
believe them existent She believed me to be a liar

Miss Colton I said sharply wait

She kept on

Wait I said again Listen to me

She seemed to hesitate and then turned her head

I am listening she said What is it

You have no right to disbelieve me

I disbelieve you Why should you think I disbelieve you I am not
sufficiently interested to believe or disbelieve I assure you

But you do You judge me

_I_ judge you You flatter yourself Mr Paine

But you do You apologized just now for judging me without a hearing
the other day You acknowledged that you should not have done it You
are doing the same thing now

I apologized for presuming to offer advice to a stranger I did not
apologize for the advice itself I think it good I do not care to argue
the matter further

You are not asked to argue But your sneer at my reasons proves that
you believe that I have none and am merely trying to justify myself with
trumped up and lying excuses You are wrong and since you presumed to
judge me then you must listen to me now I haveor hadreasons for
living as I have done for being the idler and goodfornothing you
believe me to be I cant tell you what they are I can tell no one But
I do ask you to believe that I have them that they are real and that
my being what you termed ambitionless and a country loafer is not my
condition from choice It is my right to insist upon your believing
that Do you believe it

At last I had made an impression My earnestness seemed to have shaken
her contemptuous indifference She looked at me steadily frowning a
little but regarding me less as if I were a clod and more and more as
if I were the puzzle she had once declared me to be I did not shun her
look now but met it eye to eye

Do you believe me I demanded

Slowly her frown was disappearing

Do you believe me I said again You must

Must

Yes you must I shall make you If not now at some other time You
must believe me Miss Colton

The frown disappeared altogether and she smiled

If you order me to I suppose I must she said with a shrug of mock
resignation I should have learned by this time that it is useless to
say no when you say yes Mr Paine

But do you

She turned altogether and faced me

I am very glad to believe you she said with simple directness

I stammered a Thank you and was silent I dared not trust myself to
speak at the moment Somehow the sincerity of her words moved me far
more than their trifling import warranted She had declared her belief
that I was not a liar that was all and yet I stood there fighting down
all sorts of ridiculous emotions The situation was decidedly strained
but as usual she saved it

It seems to me she said with the twinkle which I had learned
to recognize as a forerunner of mischief on her part that you are
inclined to make mountains out of molehills Mr Paine Was there any
need to be quite so fiercely tragic And besides I think that even now
you have not told the whole truth

The whole truth Why Miss Colton I have just explained that

Oh not that truth Your mysterious reasons are not my affair And
I have told you that I was willing to take those on trust But you have
not been quite truthful in another particular You intimated that you
were an idler I have been given to understand that you are far from
being an idler just now

I was relieved Oh I see I exclaimed You meansome one has told
you of my employment at the bank

A number of persons have told me Surely you did not expect to keep
THAT a secretin Denboro

Well scarcely I admitted with a laugh That was known almost
before I was sure of it myself You should have seen Eldredges face
when I announced my intention And LuteMrs Rogers husbandhasnt
completely recovered yet The sight of me actually trying to earn a
living was too much for him You see what a miracle worker you are
Miss Colton

Did you really accept the position simply because of what I said to
you

Yes The chance had been offered me before but it was your frankness
that shocked me into taking it

Not really You are joking

No Im not You are responsible Are you sorry

Her answer was a question

Are you she asked

No At first it seemed ridiculous and strange even to myself but now
I like the work It is like old times

Old times

I was forgetting myself again talking too much was a dangerous
trainfor me I laughed with pretended carelessness

Why yes I was employed in a bank at one time I think I told you
that Have you been motoring much of late Miss Colton

Yes Tell me please You really like your work

Yes I do

Then I will answer your question I am not a bit sorry I am glad I was
impertinent and intrusive especially now that I have apologized and
you have accepted the apology I am very glad I told you you should do
something worth while

Even if it were nothing more than to follow Thoph Newcombs example and
sell fish

Yes laughingly even that I WAS impertinent wasnt I I dont
wonder you were offended

I needed the impertinence I guess But frankly Miss Colton I cant
see why you should be glad because I have gone to work I cant see what
difference my working or idling can possibly make to you

Oh it doesnt of courseexcept on general principles I am a
dreadful idler myself but then I am a woman and idleness is a womans
right

I thought of Dorinda and of the other housewives of Denboro and how
little of that particular right they enjoyed which thought brought
again and forcibly to my mind the difference between this girls life
and theirsand Mothersand my own

A man continued Miss Colton sagely should not idle He should work
and work hardso that the rest of us may be as good for nothing as we
please That is philosophy isnt it

Yes

You were good enough not to say what sort of philosophy Thank you But
seriously Mr Paine I am fond of your mothervery fond considering
our short acquaintanceand when I saw her lying there so patient and
deprived of the little luxuries and conveniences which she needs and
which a little more money might bring to her it seemed to me   
Gracious what a lot of nonsense I am talking What is the matter with
me this afternoon Do lets change the subject Have you sold your land
yet Mr Paine Of course you havent That is more nonsense isnt it

I think she had again spoken merely on the impulse of the moment
doubtless there was no deliberate intention on her part to bring me to a
realization of my position the position I occupied in her thoughts
but if she had had such an intent she could not have done it more
effectively She believed me to have been neglecting Mother and her
interest in my doing something worth while was inspired merely because
she wished Mother to be supplied with those luxuries and conveniences
she had mentioned Well my question was answered this was the
difference my working or idling made to her And for a minute or two
I had been foolish enough to fancy her interested as a friend in my
success or failure in life I might have known better And yet because
of the novelty of the thing because I had so few friends I felt a pang
of disappointment

But I resolved she should not know she had disappointed me I might have
been a fool but I would keep my foolishness a secret

No Miss Colton I said with a smile I havent sold yet

Father said he saw you at the bank Did he say anything about the
land

He said his offer was still open that was all

You are resolved not to sell

To him Yes I am resolved I think he knows it I tried to make it
plain

You say to him Are you thinking of selling to any one else To the
town

No Probably not to any one Certainly not to your father or the town

She looked at me with an odd expression and seemed to hesitate

Mr Paine she said slowly would you resent my giving you another
bit ofadvice

Not at all What is it this time

Why nothing I must not give you any advice at all I wont Instead
Ill give you one of Fathers pet proverbs It isnt an elegant one but
he is very fond of repeating it There are more ways of killing a cat
than choking it to death with butter There you will admit it is not
elegant

But Miss Colton Killing a cat What in the world

You mustnt ask me I shouldnt have said even that But remember it
is fathers pet proverb I must go Please give my love to your mother
and tell her I shall call again soon Goodby

She walked briskly away and did not look back I went home I thought a
great deal during the evening and until late that night When at last
I did go to bed I had not made much progress in the problem of the cat
but I did believe that there was a rat in the vicinity I was beginning
to scent one If I was not mistaken it called itself the Bay Shore
Development Company

I said nothing to Mother of the new proposal to buy our land but next
morning at the bank I wrote a letter to the cashier of a bank in Boston
one of our correspondents and with which our little institution was on
very friendly terms I asked the cashier to make some guarded inquiries
concerning the Bay Shore Company to find out if possible who was
behind it and also to inquire concerning Barclay and Keene the real
estate brokers of Milk Street

The reply to my letter reached me on Friday It was satisfactory
eminently so And when on Saturday afternoon Mr Keene bland and
smiling as ever made his appearance at the house I was ready for him
I stood on the step and made no move to invite him within Well Mr
Paine he said cordially are you ready to talk business

Quite ready I answered

He beamed with satisfaction

Good he exclaimed Then what is your figure

My figure is a naught I replied with emphasis You may tell your
employer that I do not care to sell the land to him no matter whether
he calls himself James Colton or the Bay Shore Development Company Oh
yes and if you like you may add that this particular cat declines to
be choked

Mr Keene showed signs of choking himself and I shut the door and left
him outside Lute who had been listening at the diningroom window and
had heard only fragments of the brief interview was in a state of added
incoherence

Well by time he gasped Whatwhat sort of talk was that Chokin a
cat A cat We aint got no cat

Havent we I observed Why no so we havent Perhaps you had
better explain that to Mr Keene Lute It may help him to understand
the situation And add that I suggest his telling the person who sent
him here that softsoap is no improvement on butter

I think Lute did tell him just that doubtless with all sorts of excuses
for my insanity for the next day Sunday as I walked along the beach
a big body came ploughing down the sandy slope and joined me

Hello said Colton

Good morning said I

How are independence and public spirit these days

Very well thank you How are Development Companies developing

He put back his head and laughed He did not seem a bit chagrined or
discomfited The joke was on him but he could enjoy it nevertheless
In spite of my antagonism toward this man I could not help admiring
certain traits of his character He was big in every way Little
repulses or setbacks did not trouble him

Say he said how did you know about that cat

Saw his footprints I replied They were all over the scheme And
your friend Keene purred too loud

I dont mean that Keene was a fool that was plain enough for anyone
to see I had to use him if Barclay hadnt been sick it might have
been different But how did you come to send me that message about the
butter Man that is one of my favorite sayingsthe choking the cat
thing How did you know that I never said it to you

Oh it is an old saying I have heard it often and it did seem to fit
in this case I imagined you would understand and appreciate

Umyes dryly I appreciated all right As to understandingwell
Ill understand later on Thats another little conundrum for me to
work out Somebodys been talking of course Here hold on as I was
walking away Dont go I want to talk to you

He characteristically did not ask whether or not I wanted to talk to
him but as I happened to be in no hurry I stopped and waited for him
to continue He thrust his hands into his pockets and looked me over
very much as he might have looked over a horse he was thinking of
buying

Paine he said suddenly do you want to go to work

Work I repeated I am at work already

Youve got a job such as it is It might be work for the average jay
but it isnt for you Ill give you something to work atyes and work
for

I stared at him in wondering suspicion

What is this another Development Company I demanded

Ha ha not this time No this is straight If youll say that youll
work for me Ill make an opening for you in my New York office

I did not answer I was trying to fathom the motive behind this new
move

Ill put you to work in my office he went on It may not be much to
begin with but you can make it anything you like thatll be up to you
As to salarywell I dont know what youre getting in that onehorse
bank but Ill double it whatever it is That will be the start of
course After that it is up to you as I said

Mr Colton this may be a good joke but I dont see ityet

I dont joke often in business cant afford to

You are really serious You mean what you say

Yes

But why You dont know anything about me

I know all that is necessary And I have found out that you are all
right so far as bank work goes That fellow Taylor and some others told
me that But I didnt need their telling Why man it is part of my
trade to know men when I see them I have to know em I said a while
ago that you didnt belong in this forsaken hole of a town God knows
it IS forsaken Even my wife is beginning to admit that and she was the
keenest to come here Some day I shall get sick of it and sell out I
suppose

Sell out

Oh not yet Mabelmy daughterseems to like it here for some
unknown reason and wants to stay And I dont intend to sell until Ive
boughtwhat I set out to buy But Im not the subject were talking
about just now You are Come heres your chance to be somebody More
chance than I had Ill tell you that You can go to work in my office
next week if you want to Will you

I laughed at the idea I believed I had found the motive I was seeking
Of course not I said You cant close the Lane by that kind of
bribery Mr Colton

Bribery be hanged Come come Paine Wake up or I shall think your
brains arent up to standard after all When I bribe I bribe When I
ask a man to work for me there are no strings tied to the offer Forget
your picayune land for a minute Time enough to remember that when Ive
got it which will be some day or other of course Im making you this
offer because I want you Youre sharp you saw through that Development
game Youre cleveryour sending me that cat message proves it And
your not telling me where the idea for the message came from proves that
you can keep your mouth shut I could use a dozen fellows like you if
I could get them You interested me right at the start A chap with sand
enough to tell Jim Colton to go to the devil is always interesting Im
offering you this chance because I think it is a good chance for both
of us Yes and because I like you I suppose in spite of your
pigheadedness Will you take it

No thank you I answered

Why Because you cant leave your sick mother Shell be all right
I was talking with the doctorQuimby his name is isnt itand he
happened to mention that he was encouraged about her Said she had been
distinctly better for the last month

I could not believe it Doctor Quimby had said nothing of the sort to
me It was impossible Mother BETTER

That doesnt mean she is going to be well and strong again of course
he added not unkindly But I think Quimby believes she may be well
enough toperhapssit up one of these days Be wheeled about in a
chair or something of that sort    Why what is the matter You
looked as if I had knocked you out Hasnt the doctor said anything to
you

No I stammered I WAS knocked out I could not believe it Mother
the bedridden invalid of six long years to be well enough to sit up
to use a wheeled chair It could not be true It was too good to be
true

So you see you could leave her all right went on Colton If it was
necessary you could get a nurse down here to look after her while you
were away And you might get home every fortnight or so Better take my
offer Paine Come with a grunt of impatient amusement dont keep me
waiting too long I am not used to coaxing people to work for me it is
usually the other way around This offer of mine happens to be pretty
nearly a disinterested one and with one of his dry smiles all my
offers are not that kind as you ought to know Will you say yes now Or
do you want till tomorrow to think it over

The news concerning Mother had upset me greatly but my commonsense was
not all gone That there was something behind his offer I believed but
even if there were notif it was disinterested and made simply because
my unearthing of the Bay Shore cat had caught his fancyI did not
consider for a moment accepting it Not if Mother was like other women
well and strong would I have accepted it In Denboro I was Roscoe
Paine and my life story was my own secret In New York how long would
it be before that secret and my real name were known and all the old
disgrace and scandal resurrected

What do you say asked Colton again Want more time to think about
it do you

I shook my head No I answered I have had time enough I am obliged
for the offer and I appreciate your kindness but I cannot accept

I expected him to express impatience or perhaps anger at least to ask
my reasons for declining But his only utterance was a Humph For a
moment he regarded me keenly Then he said

Havent got the answer yet have I All right Well briskly when
are you and I going on that shooting trip

There is no shooting at present I answered as soon as I could adjust
my mind to this new switch in the conversation

That so Any fishing

I believe the squiteague are running outside I heard they were

What Squitwhich

Squiteague Weakfish some people call them

They are pretty fair sport arent they

Yes fair Nothing like bluefish however

All right What is the matter with our going squintsquintsomething
or othering one of these days Will you go Or are you as pigheaded
about that as you are about other things

I laughed Not quite I said I should be glad of your company Mr
Colton

Next Saturday suit you

Yes After bank hours

All right Ill look after the boat You provide the bait and tackle
Thats fair isnt it Right Be on hand at my dock at one oclock
Morning

He walked off Neither of us had thought of the tidehe probably not
realizing that high water was an important factor and I being too much
agitated by what he had said about Mother and the suddenness with which
the fishing trip was planned to think calmly of anything

That week was a strange one to me and the first of many strange ones
My manner of life was changing although I did not realize it and
although the change came through no effort of my own Our house which
had been so long almost a hermitage if a home containing four persons
might be called that was gradually becoming a social center Matilda
Dean had called once a week regularly for some time and this particular
week Captain Jed came with her Captain Elisha Warren and his cousin and
housekeeper Miss Abbie Baker drove down for a halfhours stay George
Taylor and Nellie spent an evening with us I feared the unaccustomed
rush of company might have a bad effect upon Mother but she seemed
actually the better for it She professed to believe that Denboro was
awakening to the fact of my merits as a man and a citizen They are
finding you out at last Boy she said I laughed at her I knew
better It was because of my position in the bank that these people
came I was making good there apparently and the surprise at
this caused Captain Warren and the rest to take a new and no doubt
transitory interest in me

And I thought I knew Captain Jeds reason for coming An interview
between us gave me the inkling Matilda was in Mothers room and Dean
and I were together in the diningroom

Ros said the captain suddenly you aint backin water are you

Backing water What do you mean by that

In this Lane business You aint callatin to sell out to Colton
after all

Well hardly Why do you say that

Nothin maybe But they tell me youre kind of thick with the Ryal
family lately Beriah Holt says he see you and the Colton girl come out
of the woods back of his place one afternoon a spell ago She was on
horseback and you was walkin but Beriah says you and she was mighty
friendly

I might have expected this In Denboro one does few things unnoticed

She had lost her way in the woods and I helped her to find the road
home I said that was all

Hum You helped her to find the road the night of the strawberry
festival too didnt you

How in the world did you find that out

Oh it just sort of drifted around Ive got pretty big earsmaybe
youve noticed emand they genrally catch some of whats blowin
past There was a coachman mixed up in that nights work and he talked
some I shouldnt wonder most of his kind do

Well what of it I asked sharply I helped her as I would your
daughter if she had been caught alone in a storm like that I should
have been ashamed not to

Sartin Neednt get mad about it Whats this about your takin his
Majesty off fishin next Saturday

All of my personal affairs seemed to be common property I was losing my
temper in spite of my recent good resolutions

Look here Captain Dean I said I have a right to take any one
fishing if I choose Mr Colton asked me to do it and I saw no reason
for saying no

Funny he should ask you He aint asked anybody else in town

I dont know that and I dont care I shall do as I please I have
no grievance against the Coltons I shall not sell them my land but I
reserve the right to meet themyes and to associate with themif I
choose You and your friends may as well understand that Captain

There there dont get huffy I aint got the right to say what your
rights are Ros And I dont think for a minute youd back water on the
Lane business apurpose But I do think youre takin chances I tell
you honest Im scart of old Colton in a way and I aint scart
of many folks Hes a fighter and hes smart He and I have had some
talks

You have I interrupted

Yup Lively squabbles they was too Each of us expressin our opinion
of tother and not holdin back anything to speak of I dont know how
he felt when we quit but I know I respected himfor his out and open
cussedness and grit if nothin else And I think he felt the same way
about me But hes smartconsarn him he is And HE never backs water
Thats why I think youre takin chances in bein too friendly with him
Hes layin low and if you get off your guard just once hell grab

I hesitated then I made up my mind

Captain Dean I said his smartness hasnt caught me yet Im going
to tell you something but first you must promise not to tell anyone
else

He promised and I told him of Mr Keene and the Bay Shore Company
He listened interrupting with chuckles and exclamations When I had
finished he seized my hand and wrung it

By the everlastin he exclaimed that was great I say again youre
all right Ros Paine Even _I_ swallered that Development Company hook
line and sinker But YOU saw through it

I tell you this I said so that you will understand I have no
intention of backing water

I know you aint Knew it afore and now I know it better But I cant
understand what the Colton game isand there is a game sure That
daughter of his nowshe may be in it or she may not Shes pretty
and I will give in that shes folksy and sociable with us natives its
surprisin considerin her bringin up Nellie and Matildy like her
Nellie especial Theyre real chummy as you might say Talk and talk
just as easy and common as you and I this minute Ive heard em two or
three times at my house when they thought I wasnt listenin and twice
out of the three they was talkin about you

About ME I repeated

Yes I dont wonder youre surprised I was myself Asked Nellie about
it and she just laughed Said you was the principal object of
interest in town just now which is more or less true But it makes me
suspicious all the same Why should a girl like that Colton one talk
about a feller like you Youre as fur apart furs anything in common
is concerned as molasses is from vinegar Aint that so

It was so of course but he need not have been so brutally frank in
telling me However I nodded and admitted that he was right

Yes he said A blind horse could see there was no sensible open and
aboveboard reason for HER bein interested in YOU So theres another
reason the way I look at it and thats why Id be mighty careful
mighty careful Ros Her pas got a new trick up his sleeve and shes
helpin him play it thats my notion So be careful wont you

Ill be careful said I I knew as well as I knew my real namewhich
he did notthat Mabel Colton was not helping her father play any
tricks I had seen enough of her to be certain she was not tricky And
besides if she were in sympathy with her parent why had she given me
the hint which put me on the trail of the Development Company Why had
she given me the hint at all That was the real riddle and I had
not as yet hit upon a plausible answer Those I had hit upon were
ridiculous and impossible and I put them from my mind But she was not
tricky that I knew

Captain Jed changed the subject and we talked of Nellies wedding which
was to take place in a month The captain was full of various emotions
regret at losing his daughter and joy because of her getting such a good
husband His last words were these

Ros he said be careful for my sake full as much as yours This
Lane business and Nellies gettin married have sort of possessed me
same as the evil spirits did the swine in scriptur I lay awake nights
fussin for fear the marriage wont turn out happy or for fear
youll sell the Lane after all And ones just as likely to happen as
totherwhich means theyre both impossible I callate But look out
for that Colton girl whatever else you do Shes a good deal better
lookin than her dad but shes just as dangerous You mark my words
son the feller that plays with fire takes chances So dont be TOO
sociable with any of the tribe

And the very next afternoon the dangerous person herself called and she
and I spent an hour in Mothers room where the three of us chatted
like old friends She had the rare power of making one forget self and
personal worries and I could readily understand why Mother had been so
completely won by her She was bright and cheery and sympathetic Here
there was no trace of the pride of class and the arrogance which had
caused me to hate her so heartily at first It seemed almost as if
she had set herself the task of making me like her in spite of my
prejudices My reason told me that this could not be it was merely her
fancy for Mother which caused her to notice me at all she had as much
as said so more than once But I did like her I acknowledged it in
my thoughts and after she had gone the room with its drawn shades
seemed doubly dark and gloomy Mother was silent for a few minutes and
I too said nothing Then

She is a wonderful girl isnt she Roscoe said Mother

She was altogether too wonderful that was the trouble A girl like
her had no place in our lives I went out for a walk and a smoke by the
bluff edge and almost before I knew it I found myself standing at
the border of the grove looking at the great house and trying to guess
which was her room and if she was there and of what or whom she might be
thinking just then Mark my words son Captain Jed had declared the
feller that plays with fire takes chances

I turned on my heel and set out for home I would take no chances I
must not play with fire even though the flames had for the moment
dazzled me I had called myself a fool many times in the past few years
but I would not be so great a fool as that



CHAPTER XV


So I resolved more resolutely than ever to keep out of her way to
see as little of her as possible and as had happened before to similar
resolutions of mine with which she was concerned this one was rendered
noneffective through no fault of my own almost as soon as it was
made For on Saturday afternoon as I approached the Colton wharf laden
with bait and rods for the fishing excursion in the Colton boat I saw
her standing there beside her father waiting for me

Weve got a passenger Paine said Big Jim Youve met her before
I believeon the water and in it No objections to my daughters going
along have you

What could I say except to announce delight at the addition to our
party Perhaps I did not say it as heartily as I might for Miss
Colton who was regarding me with a mischievous smile observed
demurely

I am sure he must be delighted Father Mr Paine knows I am very fond
of fishing dont you Mr Paine

Yes oh yes of course I stammered

He does eh Her father seemed surprised How did he find that out

I thought the question was addressed to her so I did not answer She
seemed to think otherwise for she said

Did you hear Mr Paine Father asks how you knew I was fond of
fishing

Whyeryou told me so Miss Colton I replied If she had not
related her Seabury Pond experience to her parents I did not propose to
be trapped into doing so She laughed merrily

Did I she asked Yes I believe I did

Mr Colton looked at us each in turn

Humph he observed I dont seem to be aboard this train Whats the
joke

She saved me the problem of inventing a satisfactory answer

Oh its a little joke of Mr Paines and my own she explained Ill
tell you about it by and by Father It would take too long to tell now
He saved my life once more thats all

Oh thats all Humph And you did not think a trifle like that worth
mentioning to me I suppose Would you mind telling me what it was he
saved you from this time

From starvation I was a famished wayfarer and he took me in There
Daddy dont puzzle your poor brain any longer It is all right and
Ill tell you all about it when we get home Now I am sure we should
be starting if we are to have any fishing at all Shall we cast off
Mrthat is Captain Paine

That fishing trip was not a huge success if judged solely by the size
of the catch The weakfish were not hungry or we did not tempt them with
bait to their taste that day We got a half dozen of which I caught
three Miss Colton two and her father but one His however was a big
one much the biggest of the six and he had a glorious time landing it
He fished as he appeared to do everything else with intense earnestness
and determination He evidently considered the struggle a sort of
personal disagreement between the fish and himself and as usual
intended to have his way He succeeded after a while and announced that
he had not enjoyed anything as much since arriving in Denboro

His daughter also seemed to be enjoying herself She was quite as good a
fisher as her father and when the sport was over and we reeled in
our lines preparatory to starting for home rallied him not a little
at having been the least successful of the party He took her teasing
goodnaturedly

You think it is quite a feat to get the better of your old dad dont
you my lady he observed

Of course I do It is isnt it

He chuckled Well maybe youre right he admitted You do it oftener
than any one else that is certain Paine you might take lessons from
her if you are still hoping to keep up your end in the little fight you
and I have on hand

She turned to me and smiled Her graceful head was silhouetted against
the red glow of the sunset and a loosened strand of her hair waved in
the light breeze

I think Mr Paine does not need lessons from any one she said He
seems to be holding his own very well

But hes frightened all the same Come Paine own up now You know
you are frightened dont you

Not very I answered truthfully

So Then you arent as sensible as you ought to be A wise man knows
when to be scared Lets make a little bet on it Ill bet you two to
one that Ill own that land of yours inside of six months

I shook my head I never bet on certainties I declared I should be
ashamed to collect my winnings

This seemed to amuse them both for they both laughed

Father said Miss Colton I am afraid you dont learn by experience
You have lost one bet already you know

Thats so And I havent paid it yet either I must or youll be
telling every one that I am a poor sport Paine this young lady bet me
a new pipe against a box of gloves that you wouldnt

Father broke in the young lady herself stop

Oh all right all right Just as you say But I tell you this Paine
SHE hasnt any scruples against betting on certainties

She was leaning against the cockpit rail looking forward and I could
not see her face She spoke without turning

You thought yours was the certainty she said You warned me that I
was sure to lose

Did I Well you may even yet On the whole I think Ill wait a while
before buying those gloves Remember there was no time limit When you
said that

Father more firmly please be quiet You have said quite enough Mr
Paine is not likely to be interested in the family gambling

I was interested in this particular gamble The wager had obviously
something to do with me I suppose I should have felt flattered at being
made the subject of a bet in such select circles but I did not I had
not been informed as to the details of that bet

There was nothing more said about it at the time and my passengers
talked of other things as we sailed home before the fast dying breeze
It died almost altogether as we passed the lighthouse at Crow Point and
entered the bay and for an hour we barely held our own against the
tide The sun set twilight came and the stars appeared one by one
Colton lying at full length on the deck forward of the cockpit smoked
in lazy enjoyment His only remark in ten minutes was to the effect that
his wife had probably drowned us all in her mind a dozen times over by
now

His daughter sitting by the rail and looking out over the smooth
darkly glimmering water bade him be quiet

You must not talk she said This is the most wonderful night I ever
experienced How still it is You can hear every sound Hark

From the dusk to port came the clear strokes of a church bell striking
eight

That is the clock at the Methodist Church isnt it asked Miss
Colton

Yes said I

The church where the strawberry festival was held

Yes

Colton struck a match to relight his cigar

Shouldnt think that would be a pleasant reminder to either of you he
observed I am mighty sure it wasnt to me

Miss Colton did not answer nor did I

The breeze sprang up again soon after from a different quarter this
time but the tide had ebbed so far that I was obliged to make the
detour around the end of the flat upon which Victor had grounded the
dingy Big Jim raised himself on his elbow

Hello he exclaimed heres another joyful spot Mabel it was along
here somewhere that Paine acquired the habit of carrying you about like
a bundle It must have been a picturesque performance Wish I might have
seen it

He laughed heartily

Father said the young lady coldly dont be sillyplease

He chuckled and lay down again and no one spoke during the rest of the
voyage It was after nine when I brought the boat up to the wharf made
her fast and lowered and furled the sail

Better come up to the house with us and have a bit to eat Paine
urged Colton You must be hungry I know I am

Oh no thank you said I Supper will be waiting for me at home

Glad to have you if youll come Tell him to come Mabel

Miss Coltons invitation was not overcordial

I presume Mr Paine knows what is best for him to do she said Of
course we shall be glad to have him if he will come

I declined and after thanking me for the sail and the pleasure of the
fishing trip they left me Colton carrying his big squiteague by the
gills its tail slapping his leg as he climbed the bluff A moment later
I followed

The night was as my feminine passenger had said wonderfully quiet and
sounds carried a long way As I reached the juncture of the path and
the Lane I heard a voice which I recognized as Mrs Coltons She was
evidently standing on the veranda of the big house and I heard every
word distinctly

You are so unthinking James You and Mabel have no regard for my
feelings at all I have been worried almost to death Do you realize the
time I warned you against trusting yourself to the care of that common
FELLOW

The fellow heard no more He did not wish to He was tramping heavily
through the dewsoaked undergrowth He needed now no counsel against
playing with fire The cutting contempt of Mrs James W Coltons
remark was fireextinguisher sufficient for that night

Miss Colton and I met again at the door of the bank a day or two later
just at closing time Sam Wheeler had already gone and I left George at
his desk poring over papers and busily figuring He was working
over time much of late and explained his industry by the fact of his
approaching marriage and his desire to make things easy for me to handle
while he was on his brief wedding trip I was not much alarmed by the
prospect He was to be gone but a week and I had become sufficiently
familiar with the routine to feel confident in assuming the
responsibility Small my predecessor had a brother who had formerly
been employed in the bank and was now out of work and he was coming in
to help during the cashiers absence I was not worried by the prospect
of being left in charge but I was worried about George He so it
seemed to me had grown pale and thin Also he was nervously irritable
and not at all like his usual goodnatured self I tried to joke him
into better humor but he did not respond to my jokes He seemed too
to realize that his odd behavior was noticeable for he said

Dont mind my crankiness Ros Ive got so much on my mind that Id be
mean to my old grandmother if I had one I guess likely Dont let my
meanness trouble you it isnt worth trouble

I laughed George I said if I ever dreamed of such a thing as
getting married myself you would scare me out of it You ought to be a
happy man and act like one instead you act as if you were about to be
jailed

He caught his breath with a sort of gasp Then after a pause and
without looking up he asked slowly

Jailed What in the world made you say that Ros

I said it because you act as if you were bound for states prison
instead of the matrimonial altar George what IS troubling you

Troubling me Whywhy nothing special of course Catching up with my
work here makes me nervous andand kind of absentminded I guess Act
absentminded dont I

He did there was no doubt of that but I did not believe it was his
work which caused the absentmindedness

If there is any trouble George I said earnestly if youre in any
difficulty personally I shall be very glad to help you if I can I
mean that

For a moment I thought he hesitated Then he shook his head

I know you mean it Ros he answered Im much obliged to you too
But theres nothing to help me with Im just nervous and tired thats
all

I did not believe it but I felt that I had said all I could
considering his attitude I bade him good night and left the building
As I came down the steps Miss Colton was just crossing the road from
Eldredges store a good sized brown paper parcel in her hand

Ever since the day when Captain Jed had given me his warning I had been
strengthening my resolution The remark of Mrs Coltons which I had
overheard on the night of the fishing trip although it revealed to me
as I believed my real standing in the minds of my neighbors whatever
they might pretend when in my company was after all only a minor
detail I knew that I must break off my acquaintance with this girl By
all that was sensible and sane it must be broken off I must not for
my own sake continue to meet her to see her and speak with her No
I would avoid her if I could but at all events I would break off the
association even if I were obliged to offend her deliberately offend
her to accomplish my purpose I swore it and then I swore at myself
for being so weakminded as to need to swear That I should be afraid
of a girl a mere girl ten years younger than I who as the casual
pastime of an idle summer had chosen to pretend an interest in me I
was not afraid of her of course I was afraid of myself Not that I was
in danger of falling in love with herthat idea was too ridiculous
to be even funny But she was becoming a disturbing influence in my
lifethat was it a disturbing influenceand I must not permit myself
to be disturbed

So now as I saw the disturbing influence crossing the road in my
direction my first thought was to retreat to the bank But it was
too late to retreat she had seen me and she bowed pleasantly as she
approached

Good afternoon she said

I bowed and admitted that the afternoon was a good one conscious as I
did so that Sim Eldredge had followed her to the door of his store and
was regarding us with marked interest

She exhibited the package I am acting as my own errand boy you see
she said smiling It was such a beautiful day that I refused to send
any one for this or even to ride I did not realize that a few yards
of muslin would make such a bundle Now I must carry it I suppose in
spite of appearances

I believed I saw an opportunity to escape

I am going directly home I said Let me carry it down for you I
will send it over to your house by Lute

Oh no thank you I could not think of troubling Mr Rogers But do you
really want to carry it You may for a while We will take turns I
am going directly home too and we will walk down together Unless of
course you are in a hurry

I think it was the expression of my face which led her to add the last
sentence If I had had time to think to summon my resolution it is
possibleyes it is possible that I should have declared myself to
be in a hurry and gone on alone But she had caught me unawares and
resolution was wanting I announced that I was in no hurry at all and
took the parcel

We walked on together she chatting easily and I pretending to listen
although aware that our progress was watched by eager eyes and commented
upon and exclaimed over by many tongues The drawn shades of parlor
windows moved significantly as we passed and as we turned into the
Lower Road I glanced over my shoulder and saw Sim Eldredge and his
clerk and Thoph Newcomb and Alvin Baker on the store platform staring
after us As if this audience was not sufficient and to make the affair
complete we met Captain Dean strutting importantly on his way to the
postoffice He bowed and said Afternoon but the look he gave me was
significant There was surprise in it and distrust I knew I should
have to do more explaining at our next meeting And I knew too or
could guess what was being said that very moment at the store and of
the surmising and theorizing and strengthening of suspicions which would
go on at a dozen supper tables that evening

My companion however appeared to be quite unconscious of all this
That I might be suspected and misjudged because she had chanced to
prefer my company to a walk home alone did not evidently occur to
her There was no reason why it should of course she was not in the
position where the opinion or suspicions of Denboros inhabitants need
concern her in the least But I angry at Captain Jed for his look and
with Sim Eldredge and his companions for their impudent stares and the
trouble I knew their gossipy tongues would make for me was gloomy and
resentful

She did most of the talking and I walked beside her putting in a word
occasionally and doing my best to appear as unconcerned as she really
was We crossed Elnathan Mullets bridge and continued down the Shore
Lane Suddenly I was aware that she had not spoken for some minutes

Eh Yes Miss Colton what is it I stammered Then I realized that
we were standing beside the granite posts marking the entrance to the
Colton grounds I had been so wrapped in my unpleasant thoughts and
forebodings that we had reached our journeys end without my noticing
it

Well I exclaimed and then added the brilliant observation We are
here arent we

We are she said dryly Didnt you know it

Why I had not realized The walk has seemed so short

Yes Im sure it must I think you have spoken exactly six words in the
last five minutes Will you come in

Oh no no thank you

Why not Father is in and will be glad to see you

II must be getting on toward home Supper will be ready

She bit her lip Far be it from me to criticize your domestic
arrangements Mr Paine she said but it does seem to me that your
housekeeper serves meals at odd hours It is only a few minutes after
four by my watch

She had me at a disadvantage I imagined I must have appeared
embarrassed I know I felt that way

I did not realize    I thought it much later I stammered

Then you will come in Father will like to discuss the fishing with
you I know He has talked of little but his wonderful weakfish ever
since he caught it

No thank you Miss Colton Really I must not stop

She took the parcel from my hands

Very well she said indifferently as you please I thank you for
your kindness in walking down with me Good afternoon Mr Paine

She turned away Here was the opportunity I had been waiting for the
opportunity of breaking off our acquaintance If I knew anything I knew
the tone of that Good afternoon meant that for some reason or other
she was offended just as I had been certain I wished her to be Here
was the opportunity Heaven sent to rid my life of its disturbing
influence Just what I had prayed for had come to pass

And so to prove the sincerity of my prayers and the worth of my high
resolve Icalled her back

Miss Colton I said

She apparently did not hear me so I called again

Miss Colton

Yes

I seem somehow or other to have offended you And even as I said it I
realized the completeness of the backdown realized it and blushed I
was ashamed of my weakness Yet when she asked me to repeat my words I
did so

You spoke to me she said coldly

II said I had not meant to offend you

Why should you imagine that I am offended pray You seem to think
other people must necessarily regard you as seriously as you do
yourself I am not offended

But you are

Very well then I am We wont argue the matter it is scarcely worth
argument is it

This observation called for no answer in particular at least I could
not think of one While I was groping for a word she spoke again

Dont let me detain you Mr Paine she said I am sure yoursupper
was itmust be waiting

Miss Colton youyou seem to resent my not accepting your invitation
to visit your father I assure you II should be very glad to call upon
him

Thank you I will tell him so He will be grateful doubtless Your
condescension is overwhelming Mr Paine

Miss Colton everything I say seems to be wrong this afternoon I dont
know what I have done Twice you have spoken of my condescension

Her foot was beginning to pat the grass I recognized the battle signal
but I kept on

I dont understand what you mean by condescension I said

Dont you indeed You are very dense all at once Mr Paine

Possibly But I dont understand

For an instant she hesitated Then she turned on me with a gust of
fierce impatience which took my breath away Her eyes flashed

You do she declared You do understand I am not blind Do you
suppose I could not see that you wished to avoid me when I met you at
the bank just now That my company was neither welcome nor desired That
you accepted my suggestion of walking down together merely because you
could think of no excuse for declining

This was a staggerer And the worst of it was its truth

Miss Colton I faltered I cant understand what you mean I

You do understand And please with a scornful laugh oh PLEASE
understand that I am not troubled because of THAT Your charming and
cultivated society is not indispensable to my happiness Mr Paine
strange as that may appear to you Really with cutting contempt it
is not

That I quite understand Miss Colton I said but

But you are like every one else in this horrid narrow bigoted place
Dont you suppose that I see it everywhere I go Every one here hates
usevery one We are intruders we are not wanted here and you all
take pains to make us feel as uncomfortable as you can Oh you are all
snobsall of you

I actually gasped

Snobs I repeated Wesnobs

Yes That is exactly what you are When Father came here he meant to be
a citizen a good citizen of the town He had intended to do all sorts
of things to help the village and the people in it He and I discussed
ever so many plans for doing good here And we wanted to be friendly
with every one But how have you treated us No one comes to see us We
are avoided as if we had the smallpox The majority of people scarcely
speak to us on the street I am so lonely and

She stopped I had never seen her so agitated As for me astonishment
is much too mild a term to use in describing my feelings That these
people these millionaires and aristocrats should feel that they had
been avoided and slighted that we Denboroites were the snobs that THEY
should be lonely because no one or almost no one came to call upon
themthis was too much for my bewildered brain to grasp all at once

The young lady went on

And you she exclaimed You are as bad as the rest Father has called
upon you several times I have called on your mother Father and I have
tried to be friendly and neighborly Not that we are lacking in friends
We haughtily are not obliged to BEG for friendship But we felt it
our duty to

I interrupted There is a limit to forbearance and I considered that
limit reached

Miss Colton I declared you are talking nonsense Considering the
manner in which your father treated me when we first met I

How did you treat him How did you treat Mr Carver and me when you
first met us in the auto You insulted us It was plain enough then that
you hated us

Iwhy Miss Colton I did not know who you were

Indeed Would it have made any difference if you had known I doubt it
No you are like the rest of the people here Because we have come from
the city you have chosen to be as envious and petty and disagreeable
as you can Even Nellie Dean whom I know better than any one here has
never returned my call There is a concerted plan to make us feel we are
neither welcome nor wanted Very well disdainfully we know it I
for one shall not force my presence upon any one of you again And it
is probable that I shall manage to exist even without the delights of
Denboro society Goodby Mr Paine

But Miss Colton

Goodby

Miss Colton listen to me You are wrong all wrong I tell you There
is no plan or plot to make you feel uncomfortable We are plain village
people here and you are wealthy and have been used to associating with
those of your class Every one in Denboro knew that when you came and
they have been shy of intruding where they might not be welcome Then
there was that matter of the Lane here

Oh that precious Lane I wish I had never seen it

I have wished that a number of times in the past few months But it is
here and the question overshadows everything else in the village just
now It does not seem of much importance to you perhaps perhaps it is
not so very important to me but

Again she interrupted me

I think it is important enough to make you forgetordinary courtesy
she declared Yes courtesy DONT look at me like that You know what
I mean As I told you before I am not blind Do credit me with some
intelligence All the way during this cheerful walk of ours you scarcely
spoke a word Did you suppose I did not know what was troubling you I
saw how that Captain Dean looked at you I saw those people staring from
the postoffice door I knew what you were afraid of their saying that
you are altogether too companionable with Father and me that you intend
selling the land to us after all That is what you thought they would
say and you were afraidAFRAID of their gossip Oh it is humiliating
And for a time I really thought you were different from the rest and
above such things

I began to feel as if I were once more a small boy receiving a lecture
from the governess

I am not at all afraid of them Miss Colton I protested

You are Why Your conscience is clear isnt it You dont intend
selling out to my father

Certainly not

Then why should you care what people like that may think Oh you weary
me I admired you for your independence There are few persons with the
courage to face my father as you have done and I admired you for it I
would not have had you sell us the land for ANYTHING

You would not I gasped

Certainly not I have been on your side all the time If you had sold
I should have thought you like all the rest holding back merely for
a higher price I respected you for the fight you were making You must
have known it If I had not why do you suppose I gave you that hint
about the Development Company

Goodness knows I exclaimed devoutly

And I was sure you could not be bribed by an offer of a position
in Fathers office It was not really a bribeFather has for some
unexplainable reason taken a fancy to youbut I knew you would believe
it to be bribery That is why I was so positive in telling him that you
would not accept And now youoh when I think of how I have LOWERED
myself How I have stooped to    But there I am sure that supper
of yours must be waiting Pray condescend to convey my regrets to the
faithfulwhat is her name Odd that I should forget a name like THAT
Oh yes DorindaPray convey my regrets to the faithful Dorinda
for being unwittingly the cause of the delay and assure her that the
offense will NOT be repeated Goodby Mr Paine

She walked off between the granite posts and along the curved drive
This time I made no attempt to call her back The storm had burst so
unexpectedly and had developed into such a hurricane that I had had time
to do little more than bend my head before it But I had had time enough
to grow angry I would not have called her back then for the world She
had insulted me not once only but again and again I stood and watched
her go on her way and then I turned and went on my own

The parting had come The acquaintance was broken off not precisely as
I had intended it to be broken but broken nevertheless and ended
for good and all I was glad of it There would be no more fishing
excursions no more gifts of flowers and books no more charity calls
The common fellow was free from the disturbing influence and he was
glad of itheartily glad of it

Yet his gladness was not as apparent to others as it should by all
that was consistent have been Lute evidently observed no traces of
transcendent happiness when I encountered him in the back yard beside
the woodpile sharpening the kindling hatchet with a whetstone a
process peculiarly satisfying to his temperament because it took such a
long time to achieve a noticeable result

Hello Ros he hailed Why what ails you

Ails me I repeated crossly Nothing ails me of course

Well Im glad to hear it You look as if youd lost your last friend

I havent lost any friends Far from it

Nobodys dead then

No Though I could find some who are half dead without trying very
hard

More perfectly good sarcasm wasted Lute inquired eagerly if I meant
old Mrs Lobelia Glover I heard yesterday she was pretty feeble he
added Taint to be expected shell last a long spell at her age
Doctor Quimby says she had a spine in her back for twenty years

I made no comment upon poor Mrs Glovers surprising affliction I
merely grunted and went into the house Dorinda looked at me curiously

Whats the trouble she asked

Trouble There isnt any trouble You and Lute seem to be looking for
trouble

Dont have to look far to find it in this world Anything wrong at the
bank

No

Umhm Settin so long on the fence make you uneasy I told you the
pickets would wear through if you roosted on em too long

There is nothing the matter I tell you How is Mother

She aint any wuss If twant an impossibility Id say she was better
the last month than Id seen her since she was took Nellie Dean called
on her this afternoon

Humph I should think a next weeks bride would be too busy to call on
any one except possibly the dressmaker

Umhm Well Nellie looks as if shed been callin on the dressmaker
pretty often Anyhow she looked worried and Olindy Cahoons dressmakin
gabble is enough to worry anybody She left a note for you

Who Olinda

Land sakes no What would Olindy be doin down here There aint
any brides to dress in this house or bridegrooms either unless youre
callatin to be one or Lute turns Mormon That last notion aint such
a bad one with a dry smile Another wife or two to help me take care
of him would come in handy

Who did leave the note for me then

Nellie of course She wanted me to be sure you got it Somethin about
that wonderful weddin I spose I left it upstairs on your bureau

I found the note and put it in my pocket to read later on I did not
feel like reading it then I did not feel like doing anything or seeing
any one yet least of all did I feel like being alone For if I was
alone I should think and I did not want to think I prowled about my
room for a time and then went down and spent a short time with Mother
Her first question was concerning my day at the bank and her second if
I had seen any of the Coltons recently I rather hoped Miss Mabel would
come to see me today she added I look forward to her visits so I
think shes a real friend of ours Roscoe I know you dont dear
or you try to believe you do not but she isI am convinced of it I
wonder if she will come tomorrow

I could have put a stop to her wondering on that subject but I was in
no mood to do it then I went into the diningroom Dorinda warned me
not to go far from the house because supper would be ready in a few
minutes The word supper reminded me of my unfortunate choice of an
excuse and the sarcastic reference to our odd domestic arrangements
which reminded me in its turn of other sarcasms which had followed it
My charming and cultivated society was not necessary to her happiness
   When she thought of how she had lowered herself    Other people
did not necessarily regard me as seriously as I did myself    And so
on    until Dorinda called me in to sit at the table and pretend
to eat while she and Lute commented on my lack of appetite and my
absentmindedness

It was eight oclock and I had gone up to my room to escape from their
solicitude and pointed questioning when I happened to think of Nellies
note I had not been curious concerning its contents for as I had
agreed to act as best man at the wedding I assumed as Dorinda had
done that she had written on that to her allimportant topic I took
the note from my pocket and tore open the envelope

Nellie had not written about the wedding Her letter was a long
one evidently written in great agitation and with words blotted and
underscored Its subject was the man she loved George Taylor She was
so anxious about him Did I remember that night when my mother was ill
how she had spoken of him to me and asked if I had noticed how troubled
and worried he seemed of late

And Roscoe she wrote I have noticed it more and more since then
He IS in trouble There is something on his mind something that he will
not tell me and that I can see is worrying him dreadfully He is not
like himself at all I KNOW something is wrong and I cannot find out
what it is I want to help him SO much Oh please Roscoe dont
think this is just a foolish girls imagination and does not amount to
anything It does I know it does You are his best friend Cant YOU
find out what is troubling him and help him for my sake I have meant
to speak to you about this ever so many times but I seldom see you
alone and I could not speak while he was with me So I decided to write
this letter If you will try just TRY to find out what ails him and
help him I shall never NEVER forget your kindness Perhaps he does not
want to marry me Perhaps he does not care for me as much as he thought
he did and will not tell me because he does not want me to feel bad
If that is it tell him not to mind my feelings at all I want him to be
happy If it would make him happier to have me give him up I will do it
even though I shall pray to die right away Oh cant you help him and
me Roscoe Please PLEASE try A girl ought to be perfectly happy who
is going to be married And I am so miserable I cant tell Mother
and Father because they would not believe me They would think I just
imagined it all But YOU wont think that will you You will see him
and try to help him for my sake

And so on eight closely written pages ending with another plea to me
to see poor George and help him and begging me to burn this letter
because I should be so ashamed to have any one else see it

It was a pitiful letter and even in the frame of mind I was then in
disgusted with humanity and hating the entire feminine sex I could
not help feeling sorry for Nellie Dean Of course I was surprised at
receiving such a letter and I believed just as she begged me not to
believe that the cause of her distress and anxiety was more imaginary
than real But that something was troubling George Taylor I had felt
certain for a good while The idea that he did not love Nellie I knew
was preposterous That was not it There was something else but what I
could not imagine I wanted to help the girl if I could but how could I
ask George to tell me his secrets I with a secret of my own

After pondering for some time I decided to walk up to Georges boarding
place and talk with him Nothing would come of the interview probably
but I might as well do that as anything else I must do something
something besides sit in that room and see mocking faces in every
corner faces with dark eyes and scornful lips which told me that my
charming and cultivated society was not necessary to their happiness

Taylor rented the upper floor of a house a quarter of a mile from the
bank His housekeeper answered my ring and informed me that her employer
had not yet come home

He did not even come home for supper she said Stayed over to
Nellies probably Youll most likely find him there

But I was pretty certain he was not at the Deans for as I passed their
house I noticed the windows were dark indicating that the family like
most of respectable Denboro had already retired I walked on to the
Corners Eldredges store was closed but the billiard room was radiant
and noisy I could hear Tim Hallets voice urging some one to take a new
cue cause that one aint pocketed many balls yet

I looked across at the bank The front portion of it was black enough
but the window of the directors room was alight I had located the
object of my search the cashier was there working overtime as he did
so often nowadays

I had my key in my pocket and I unlocked the big door and entered
quietly The door of the directors room was open a little way and I
tiptoed over and peeped in through the crack Taylor was seated in a
chair beside the big table his elbows upon the table and his head in
his hands As I stood there watching him he took his hands away and
I saw his face Upon it was an expression of abject misery and utter
despair I opened the door and entered

He heard the sound of the opening door and leaped to his feet His chair
fell backward on the floor with a clatter but he paid no attention to
it

Good God he cried wildly Whos that

He was deathly pale and trembling violently His appearance startled and
alarmed me

Its all right I said hastily It is IPaine I saw the light and
knew you must be here What ails you What IS the matter

For a moment he stood there staring Then he turned and picked up the
fallen chair

Oh its you Ros is it he faltered IILord how you scared me
II

George what IS the matter with you For heavens sake stand up man
He was swaying and I thought he was going to faint George George
Taylor Are you ill I am going for the doctor

No no Stay where you are I aint sick Ill be all right in a
minute Youyou scared me creeping in that way Sit down sit down

He steadied himself with one hand on the table and with the other
reached to shut a drawer which had been open beside him The drawer was
almost full of papers and lying upon those papers was a revolver



CHAPTER XVI


Before he could close the drawer completely I caught his arm and held
it

George I cried George what is the matter Tell me you must tell
me

He tried to pull his arm free Finding that I would not let him do this
he gave up the attempt and with a poor attempt at a laugh answered
Matter Why nothing is the matter I am tired and nervous same as
Ive told you Ive been for the last two or three months and you scared
me tiptoeing in like a sneak thief this time of night

Time of night It is but a little after nine What is the matter with
you

Nothing is the matter I tell you Let go of my arm Ros What do you
mean by holding on to me like this

What do YOU mean George What does THAT mean

I pointed to the drawer He looked and with a sudden effort jerked his
arm free and closed the drawer

That with a forced laugh Oh thats nothing It was late and I was
alone here so

I know better George youre frightening us all Dont you suppose we
can see that something is wrong with you I have seen it ever since I
came here to work You are worrying your friends You worry me Give us
a chance to help you Give ME a chance You owe me that Tell me your
trouble and Ill pull you out of it see if I dont

My confidence was of course only pretence but my earnestness had some
effect He looked at me wistfully and shook his head

Nobody can pull me out he said Youre a good fellow to want to
help but you cant There aint any trouble Im just nervous

I know better Youre lying George Yes you are youre lying

Humph Youre pretty plain spoken Ros Paine There aint many people
Id take that from

Youll take it from me because you cant help it and because you know
it is true Come George come You have been a friend to me the only
real friend I have had in years I have been looking for a chance to
get even for what you have done for me Maybe here is the chance Let me
help you I will

He was wavering I could see it But again he shook his head

Nobody can help me he said

George for my sakewell then if not for my sake or your own then
for Nellies give me a chance You arent treating her right George
You should think of her You

Stop Damn you Ros Paine what right have you to

The right of a friend her friend and yours Youre frightening the
poor girl to death She is beginning to be afraid you dont care for
her

I I dont care for HER I dontOh my God

To my utter amazement he began to laugh And then all at once his
laughter ceased he swayed choked and suddenly collapsing in the
chair dropped his head upon his arms on the table and sobbed sobs that
shook him from head to heel

For one strong healthy normal man to see another cry is a
disconcerting and uncomfortable experience Masculine tears do not flow
easily and poor George on the verge of hysterics was a pitiful and
distressing spectacle I was almost as completely disorganized as he I
felt ashamed for him and ashamed of myself for having seen him in such
a condition I wanted desperately to help him and I did not know what
to do so beyond patting him on the back and begging him repeatedly
to brace up and not behave like that I did nothing At last his sobs
ceased and he was silent I had risen from my chair and now I
stood there with a hand on his shoulder the ticking of the ancient
eightsided clock on the wall sounded loud in the room

Suddenly he sat up and threw off my hand

Well he said bitterly Im a fine specimen of a man aint I Aint
you proud of me

I am mighty sorry for you I answered And I mean to help you

You cant

How do you know

Because I do know Ros he turned and looked me straight in the eye
I am going to give you some good advice Take it for your own sake
Clear out of here and leave me Dont have anything more to do with me
Clear out

I did not move

Are you going to do as I tell you he demanded Mind Im telling you
this for your own good Will you clear out and leave me

I smiled Of course not I answered

Dont be a fool You cant afford to be my friend Clear out and leave
me do you hear

I hear Now George what is it

His fingers tapped the table I could see he was making up his mind

You want to know he said You wont be satisfied until you do

I have made that fairly plain I hope At least Ive tried to

His fist clenched and he struck the table

Then by the Almighty Ill tell you he cried fiercely Itll be
all over the county in a week You might as well know it now Im a
crook Im a thief Ive stolen money from this bank and I cant pay it
back because I havent got it and cant get it Im a crook I tell you
and in a week or so itll be the county jail for mine Unlessunless
with a significant glance at the drawer something else happens to me
in the meantime There now you know Are you satisfied Are you happy
because youve found out

I did not answer To tell the truth I was not entirely overcome by
surprise at the disclosure I had begun to suspect something of the
sort Yet now that my suspicions were confirmed I was too greatly
shocked and horrified to speak at once

Well he sneered Now will you clear out and let me settle this my
own way

I pulled my chair forward and sat down

Tell me all about it George I said as calmly as I could How much
is it

He stared at me aghast You wont go he cried Youyou are going to
stick by me eveneven

There there pull yourself together old fellow We wont give up the
ship yet How much is it It cant be a great sum

It aint But Rosyouyou cantyou mustnt be mixed up in this I
shant let you Dont you see

I argued and pleaded and reasoned with him for what seemed a long time
before he would consent to tell me the whole story And when it was told
there was nothing new or novel in it The old tale of an honest man who
had not meant to go wrong but tempted by one of those wiles of the
devil an inside tip on the stock market had bought heavily on
margins expecting to clear a handsome profit in a short time The stock
was Louisville and Transcontinental and the struggle for its control by
certain big interests had made copy for financial writers for nearly
a year George had bought at a time when one syndicate had so it
believed secured the control

Then something went wrong in the deal and the shares began to decline
in value He put up more margins and still more but it continued to
decline Finally under the spur of another tip the last of his own
savings having gone to the insatiate brokers he sent to bolster his
account and to save him from utter ruin some bonds belonging to the
bank

Not much he declared only about thirtyfive hundred dollars worth
thats all I never would have done it Ros but I was wild desperate
you see Here I was getting ready to be married Nellie and Capn Jed
and the rest believing me to be comfortably fixed Its easy enough now
to say that I ought to have gone to her and told her If I hadnt been
certain that the market would turn and Id be all right in a week Id
have done it But I was sure Id be all right and I couldnt take the
chance I knew what her father would say about her marrying a pauper
and I just couldnt take the risk of losing her I couldnt She means
more to me thanthanoh wait until your time comes Wait until the
girl comes along that you care for more than the whole world And
then see what youd do See what it would mean to give her up Just
waitwait and see

Yes yes I put in hastily I understand George But the stock
Louisville and Transcontinental how is it now

Just the same It is dead practically speaking It hasnt moved half
a point for six weeks Ive been expecting it would but it hasnt Its
all right the value is there I know it If I could only hang on and
wait I could get my money back part of it anyhow But I cant I
cant wait And the broker people have got those bonds Ros Ive been
fighting this thing for weeks and weeks I aint slept a night for
years or so it seems And next weeknext WEEK I was to be married My
God think of it

Here here Dont do that I urged Brace up You and I must work
this out Wasnt there any one you could go to Anyone you could borrow
the money of Thirtyfive hundred isnt such a lot

Whom could I go to I tried Lord knows I tried I did borrow a
thousand of Capn Elisha Warren trumped up some excuse or other and got
that But that was all he could let me have And I know he thought my
asking for that was queer

Did you consider going straight to Capn Dean and

Dean Capn Jed Her father Oh Ros dont be a fool altogether I
beg your pardon old man I dont mean it You mustnt mind I aint
responsible for what I say just now But I couldnt go to Capn Jed You
know him Hes as straight and square and honest as he is obstinate and
cranky If I went to him I couldnt tell him the truth And if I
lied hed suspect and want to know why I needed to borrow money And
Nelliedont you see Theres the real awfulness of the whole thing I
couldnt go to her and tell her I was a thief I couldnt see her face
when I told her And yet shes got to know it Shes got to know it

But why The stock may go up any day and then you could withdraw part
of your margin

He struck the table with another blow The stock aint moved for six
weeks I tell you he declared And Ros he leaned forward his
haggard face working with emotion those bonds aint in our safe here
where they should be and the bank examiner is due here within the next
four days Hes at Middleboro now I phoned Bearse the cashier there
this very forenoon on a matter of business and he happened to mention
that the examiner was in his bank and working his way down the Cape
Its all up with me All up And Nellie poor girl I cant be here when
she finds it out I know you think Im a poor specimen of a man Ros
but I cant face the music No desperately and I wont

He was giving way again but I seized his shoulder and shook him

Stop it I commanded Stop it George Let me think Be quiet now and
let me think There must be a way out somewhere Let me think

He leaned back in his chair All right he said hopelessly think
if you want to Though why you should want to think about a thing like
me I dont see And I used to despise a crook as much as any one and a
coward still more And now Im both a crook and a coward

I knew his cowardice was merely on Nellies account George Taylor was
no coward in the ordinary sense of the word nor was he a crook I rose
and paced up and down the room He watched me listlessly it was plain
that he felt no confidence whatever in my being able to help him After
a time he spoke

Its no use Ros he said Dont worry your head about me I aint
worth it If there was any way out any way at all Id have sighted it
long ago There aint Take my advice and leave me You dont want to be
mixed up with an embezzler

I turned on him impatiently I have been mixed up as you call it
with one before I said sharply Is my own family record so clean
that I need to pretendthere George dont be an idiot Let me think

The clock chimed ten I stopped in my walk and turned to him

George I said tell me this If you had the money to buy back these
bonds belonging to the bank you would be all right wouldnt you If you
had it in your hands by tomorrow morning I mean

Yes IF I had itbut I havent

You could send the money to the brokers and

Send I wouldnt send Id go myself and fetch the bonds back with me
Once I had them in that safe again I

And you would not take any more risks even if the market dropped and
they had to sell out your account Even if you lost every cent of your
investment

The fierce earnestness of his answer satisfied even me What do you
think I am he demanded Investment be hanged Its my name as an
honest man that I care about Once let me get that back again and Ill
face the poorhouse Yes and Ill tell Nellie the truth all except that
I was a thief I cant tell her that But I will tell her that I havent
got a cent except my salary Then if she wants to give me up all right
Ill bear it as best I can Or if she doesnt and I lose my job here
Ill get another one somewhere else Ill work at anything She and I
can wait and    But what is the use of talking like this Ive been
over every inch of the ground a thousand times There aint a ray of
light anywhere The examiner will be here the bonds will be missing
and IIll be in jail or in hell one or the other

No you wont I said firmly

I wont Why not

Because there IS a ray of light More than a ray George you go home
and go to bed Tomorrow morning I may have news for you good news

The blood rushed to his face He seized the arm of his chair

Good news he gasped Good news for ME RosRos for the Lords
sake what do you mean You dont mean you see a way to

Never mind what I mean But I should like to know what you mean by not
coming to me before What are friends for if not to help each other
Who told you that I was dead broke

You Why you aint got    Have you Ros Paine you aint got
thirtyfive hundred to spare Why you told me yourself

Shut up Get up from that chair and come with me Yes you and now
this minute Give me that thing youve got in the drawer there No Ill
take it myself You ought to be ashamed of its being there George I am
ashamed of you and if I thought you really meant to use it I should
be still more ashamed Come dont keep me waiting

Butbut Ros

Will you do as I tell you

I dragged him almost literally dragged him from the chair Then after
extinguishing the lamp I led him to the door of the bank and locked it
putting the key in my pocket

Now said I I want you to make me a promise I want you to quit
behaving like a coward because you are not one and promise me that you
will go straight home and to bed Ill see you again the first thing in
the morning Then I thinkyes I think your troubles the worst part
of them will be over

But Ros PLEASEI cant believe it Wont you tell me

Not a word Will you promise me to behave like a man and go home Or
must I go with you

No IllIll promise Ill go straight home But oh Ros I cant
understand

Good night

I left him standing there stammering incoherently like a man awakening
from a nightmare and hurried away

I could not describe my progress down the dark Lower Road and along the
Shore Lane I do not remember any portion of it I think I ran most
of the way and if I met any onewhich is not likely considering the
timehe or she must have thought me crazy My thoughts were centered
upon one fixed purpose I had made up my mind to do a certain thing and
if possible to do it that very night If I did not if I had time in
which to reflect to consider consequences I might lose my nerve and it
would not be done at all

It was with a feeling of great relief that as I came in sight of the
Colton house I saw lights in the rooms on the lower floor The family
not being native born Denboroites had not retired even though it was
well after ten I hastened up the long drive and stood before the big
door my hand upraised to the knocker And then just for a moment I
hesitated

If I lifted that knocker and let it fall if I summoned the servant and
announced that I wished to speak with Mr Colton if I did what I had
come there to do it would be all over with me in the village My new
born popularity the respect which Capn Warren and Capn Jed and
the rest of the townspeople had shown toward me of late the cordial
recognition which had been mine during the past few weeks and which
in spite of pretended indifference I had come to expect and enjoy all
these would be lost if I persisted in my purpose My future in Denboro
depended upon whether or not I knocked at that door And it was not too
late to back out even yet I had only to turn quietly away and tell
George when I saw him in the morning that I could not help him as I
had hoped And then I thought of his face as I saw it when I entered the
bankand of Nellies letter to me

I seized the knocker and rapped sharply

For a few moments my knock was unanswered Then I heard footsteps and
the door was opened Johnson the butler opened it and his clerical
countenance assumed a most astonished expression when he saw me standing
before him

Is Mr Colton in I asked

What Whatsir stammered Johnson The sir was added under protest
He did not wish to show more respect than was absolutely necessary to a
countryman but he scarcely dared speak as disrespectfully as he felt
Therefore he compromised by voicing the respect and looking the other
way

Is Mr Colton in I repeated

I dont know II dont think sosir

The windows at my left were I knew those of the library the room
where Big Jim and I had had our first lively discussion of the Shore
Lane matter I glanced at them

I think he is I said In fact I know it there is his shadow on the
curtain Tell him Mr Paine wishes to speak with him

Johnson looked as insolent as he dared and still hesitated

It is very late he said Mr Colton is not in the abit of receiving
callers at this time of night and

He was interrupted The door behind him the door leading from the
library to the hall opened and Colton himself appeared

What is it Johnson he asked Anything wrong

The butler hastened to explain

No sir he said nothing wrong exactly sir There is a person ere
to see you sir and

To see me eh Who is it Why hello Paine is that you

Mr Colton said I I am sorry to disturb you at such a late hour
but

Come in come in he interrupted What are you standing out there
for Johnson why didnt you ask Mr Paine in What do you mean by
keeping him out there

Mr Johnson looked troubled

It was so late sir he stammered I thought

You thought If I had wanted any one to think I never should have hired
you Come in Paine Come into the library

He led the way to the library and I followed him It was my second
visit to the big handsomely furnished room and again as on the first
occasion the sight of the books and all the other refinements and
luxuries which money brings to its possessor gave me a pang of envy
and resentment It added increased bitterness to the humiliation of my
errand I had left that room defiantly expressing my independence I had
come back to it

Sit down ordered Colton pulling forward the big leathercovered
chair Have a cigar

No thank you

Humph Thats what you said when you were here before Youre young
Paine When you get to be as old as I am youll never refuse a good
cigar or anything else that is good when it is offered you Well
youre still standing Arent going to refuse to sit down are you

That was exactly what I was going to do I would not sit down in that
house I would not accept the slightest courtesy from this man or any of
his people I would get rid of the unpleasant task I had come to do and
then go away never to return They might make the most of the triumph
which was to be theirs but I would compel them to understand that I
was not seeking their favor I would not accept their patronage and they
should know it This as I look back at it now seems silly and childish
enough but I was not myself that night

Mr Colton said I ignoring the proffered chair I have come to see
you on a matter of business

Business eh Umph I thought probably you were going to ask me to
go fishing with you again Im all ready for another tussle with
thosewhat do you call emsquidsquitgood Lord what a name for a
decent fish But I dont care a continental what you call em Im ready
to get at em when you say the word

My business will not detain either of us long I

Sit down man sit down You make me nervous standing there

No I wont sit

He looked at me

What is the matter with you he asked You havent got a balky
digestion have you Ive been fighting one for the last week That fool
of a country doctor tells me if Im not careful what I eat Ill keel
over pretty soon I told him Id eaten what I dashed please ever since
Id had teeth and I wasnt going to quit now But I do feel like the
devil Look it dont I

He did look ill that was a fact though I had not noticed it before
and was far from feeling pity for him then In fact I was rather glad to
know that he was uncomfortable I wanted him to be

What is the matter with you he demanded You look as if you had seen
your grandmothers ghost

I ignored the question Mr Colton I began again You made an offer
not long ago

I had caught his attention at last He leaned back in his chair

I did he said Yees I did Do you mean you are going to accept
it

In a wayyes

In a way What do you mean by that I tell you frankly Paine if you
go to work for me there must be no ifs or buts about it Youll
enter my office and youll do as I or the men under me tell you to
do

I was glad he said that glad that he misunderstood me It gave me an
opportunity to express my feelings toward himas I was feeling then

Dont let that trouble you I said sarcastically There will be no
ifs and buts so far as that is concerned I have no desire to work
for you Mr Colton and I dont intend doing so That was not the offer
I meant

He was surprised I am sure but he did not express astonishment He
bent forward and looked at me more keenly than ever

There was only one other offer that I remember making you he said
slowly That was for that land of yours I offered you five thousand
dollars for it Do you mean you accept that offer

Not exactly

Humph Paine were wasting a lot of time here it seems to me My time
is more or less valuable and my digestion is as I told you pretty
bad Come get it over What do you mean Are you going to sell me that
land

Yes

He puffed deliberately at his cigar His gaze did not leave my face

Why he asked after a moment

That is my own affair I will sell you the land but not for five
thousand dollars

His expression changed He knocked the ashes from his cigar and frowned

I see he sneered Humph Well Ive tried to make it plain to you
fellows down here that I couldnt be held up I thought Id done it but
evidently I havent Five hundred is a good price for that land Five
thousand is ridiculous but I gave you my reasons for being willing to
be robbed that much That however is the limit Ill give you five
thousand but not another cent You can take it or get out

This was better When he talked like that I could answer him and enjoy
it

Ill get out very shortly I said You are no more anxious to have
that happen than I am I dont want your other cent I dont want your
five thousand dollars Ill sell you the land on one conditionno on
two The first is that you pay me thirtyfive hundred dollars for it

WHAT

I had upset his composure this time He forgot to sneer he even forgot
to smoke

What he cried again Thirtyfive hundred Why I offered you

I know your offer This is mine I will sell you the land for
thirtyfive hundred and not another cent That as you say is the
limit You can take it oror I will follow your suggestion and get
out

We looked at each other His fingers moved toward the match box on the
table He took a match scratched it and held it to the end of his
cigar Then he took the cigar from his lips blew out the match and
tossed the latter into the fireplace

What is the second condition he asked abruptly

That you pay me in cash in money and not by check at once

At once Now do you mean

Yes now Tonight if possible if not no later than nine oclock
tomorrow morning

Humph Do you think I carry thirtyfive hundred loose in my change
pocket

I dont know But that is the second condition

Humph    Look here Paine what I offered you the five thousand
That offer holds good

I dont accept it I will sell for thirtyfive hundred no more and no
less

But why not more

I dont know Yes I do too You said once that you were willing to
pay fortyfive hundred for the privilege of having your own way Perhaps
I am willing to sacrifice fifteen hundred for the privilege of having
mine At all events I mean what I say

But why just thirtyfive Wouldnt you take thirtysix

No It is useless to argue Mr Colton and useless to ask my reasons
I have them and that is enough Will you accept MY offer

He hesitated The sneer had left his face and his tone when he addressed
me was respectful though there was a curious note of chagrin or
dissatisfaction in it I had expected him to be eager and perhaps
mockingly triumphant He was not He seemed reluctant almost
disappointed

I suppose Ill have to he said But Paine what is up Why are you
doing this Youre not afraid of me No of course youre not Youre
not the kind to squeal and lie down because you think the odds are
against you    Confound you with a sudden burst of impatience you
are enough to upset all the selfconceit a mans got in him Just as I
think Im beginning to size you up you break loose in a new place

Pardon me I put in but I dont see that you are helping to save
that valuable time of yours I understand that you accept Will you pay
me now

He rose threw away his cigar and with his hands in his pockets stood
regarding me

Your mind is made up is it he asked

Yes

Humph Have you thought of what our mutual friend Dean and the rest of
the patriots may say when they find this out

I had thought of little else all the way from the bank to his door I
was thinking of it then

Of course he added that is not my affair but

It is not

Youre right it isnt Stillhang it all Paine I dont often feel
any compunctions when I beat a fellow in a game like this and I did
intend to have my own way in this one

Well youre having it arent you I put in Why talk so much about
it

Because I am not so sure I am having it Of course I can see that for
some reason or other you need thirtyfive hundred dollars Anyone but
you if they were going to sell would get the last dime they could
squeeze You wont because you are as pigheaded asas

Oh do cut it short I snapped And then a trifle ashamed of my
rudeness Excuse me Mr Colton but this isnt exactly pleasant for me
and I want to get it over Will you pay me now

Hold on let me finish I was going to say that if you needed the
thirtyfive perhaps I could manage to let you have it

I stared at him Let me have it I cried Do you mean youll lend it
to me

Why yes maybe You and I have had such a firstrate square stand
up fight that I rather hate to have it end I want to lick you not have
you quit before Ive really begun to fight Theres no fool philanthropy
in this understand it is just for my own satisfaction

I was so taken aback by this totally unexpected offer from the man whom
I had insulted a dozen times since I entered his house that I found it
almost impossible to answer

What do you say he asked

No I faltered And then more firmly No certainly not II am much
obliged to you Mr Colton butno

All right You know best Ill take your offer and I will hand you the
money at the bank tomorrow morning Will that do

Not at the bank Mr Colton Send it over to the house if you can
conveniently

Ill have it here before ten My lawyer will draw up the papers and
arrange for transfer of title in a few days What Going are you Good
night OherPaine remember that my other offer that of the place in
my office is open when youre ready to take it

I shook my head I had turned to go but now I turned back feeling
that perhaps I should apologize again for my rudeness After all he
had been kind very kind and I had scarcely thanked him So I turned
back to say something I hardly knew what

My doing so was a mistake The door behind me opened and a voice said
reproachfully Father are you still here The doctor said    Oh I
beg pardon

I recognized the voice Of all voices in the world I wished least to
hear it just then My back was toward the door and I kept it so If she
would only go If she would only shut that door and go away

I think she would have gone but her father called her

Mabel he cried Mabel dont go Its all right Come in Paine and
I have finished our talk Nothing more you wished to say was there
Paine

No said I I was obliged to turn now I could not get out of that
room without doing it So turn I did and we faced each other

Good evening Miss Colton I said with all the calmness I could
muster

She said Good evening distantly and without any enthusiasm but I
saw her glance at her father and then at me and I knew she was wondering
what our being together could possibly mean

Paine has been making me a little call explained Colton his eye
twinkling Mabel Ill risk another bet that you cant guess why he
came

I shall not try she said disdainfully

Oh youd better No You wont Well then Ill tell you He has just
sold me that land of his    Dont look at me like that he has We
had a little disagreement as to price but with a grin I met his
figures and we closed the deal Arent you going to congratulate him
on having come to his senses at last Come hes waiting for
congratulations

This was not true I was waiting for nothing I was on my way to the
door But to reach it I was obliged to pass her and our eyes met My
glance wavered I know but hers did not For a moment she looked at me
Then she smiled Whenever I am tempted to be vain even now I remember
that smile

I congratulate him she said Come Father you must go to bed now



CHAPTER XVII


I am not going to attempt a description of my thoughts that night
It would take too long and the description would be wearisome Other
peoples miseries are not interesting and I shall not catalog mine
Morning came at last and I rose bathed my hot face in cold water and
went down stairs Early as it was not yet six I heard Dorinda in the
kitchen and having no desire for conversation I went out and walked up
and down the beach until breakfast time I had to pretend to eat but
I ate so little that both Lute and Dorinda once more commented upon
my lack of appetite Lute who had never become fully reconciled to my
becoming a member of the working class hastened to lay the blame for my
condition upon my labors at the bank

The trouble is he announced dogmatically the trouble is Roscoe
that you aint fitted for bein shut up astern of a deck Look at
yourself now Just go into Comforts room and stand in front of her
lookin glass and look at yourself There you be pale and peaked and
wore out Look for all the world just as I done when I had the tonsils
two winters ago Aint that so Dorindy

His wifes answer was a contemptuous sniff

If you mean to say that you looked peaked when you had sore throat
she announced then theres somethin the matter with your mind or your
eyesight one or tother You peaked Why your face was swelled up
like a young ones balloon Fourth of July Day And as for bein pale My
soul I give you my word I couldnt scurcely tell where your neck left
off and the strip of red flannel you made me tie round it begun

Dont make no difference I FELT pale anyhow And I didnt eat no
moren Ros does Youll have to give in to that Dorindy I didnt eat
nothin but beef tea and gruel

You et enough of them to float a schooner

Maybe I did with grieved dignity maybe I did But thats no reason
why you should set there and heave my sufferins in my face

What is the man talkin about now I didnt heave em in your face
They come there themselves same as sore throat sufferins generally do
and if you hadnt waded around in the snow with leaky boots because
you was too lazy to take em to the shoemakers to be patched they
wouldnt

Lute drew back from the table Its no use he declared a man cant
even be sick in peace in this house Some wives would have been sorry to
see their husbands with one foot in the grave

Your feet was in the cookstove oven most of the time There there the
more you talk the further from home you get You started in with Roscoe
and the bank and youre in the grave already If I was you Id quit
afore I went any further Land knows where you might fetch up if you
kept on I    Mercy on us whos at the kitchen door this time in the
mornin

Her husband ever curious was on his way to answer the knock already
He came back a moment later sputtering with excitement

Its that Mr butler the Johnson over to Mr Coltons he whispered
I mean its that JutlerthatThere Dorindy you see what sort of a
state your hectorin has worked me into Its that parson critter who
opens Coltons door for him thats who tis And he wants to see Ros I
tried to find out what for but he wouldnt tell

Even Dorinda showed surprise She looked at the clock This hour of the
mornin she exclaimed what in the world

I hastened to the kitchen closing the diningroom door behind me
just in time to prevent Lutes following me Johnson the butler
was standing on the mica slab at the threshold inspecting our humble
premises with lofty disdain

Mr Colton sent this to you sir he said handing me an envelope He
wishes you to send a receipt by me

I took the envelope and stepping back out of sight tore it open
Inside was a check on a New York bank for four thousand dollars It was
made payable to Bearer With it was this brief note


Dear Paine

This is the best I can do for you as I havent the money on hand Cash
it yourself take out your thirtyfive hundred and hold the additional
five hundred until I or one of the family call for it I made the
thing payable to Bearer because I imagined you would prefer it that way
Send me some sort of receipt by Johnson anything will do I will see my
lawyer in a day or two Meanwhile have your papers deeds etc ready
when he calls for them

Yours truly

JAMES W COLTON


For a minute I considered If I could cash the check at the bank without
Taylors knowledge and get him off to Boston on the early train I
might be able to cover my tracks It was necessary that they should be
covered Knowing George as I did I knew that he would never consent to
my sacrifice He would not permit me to wreck my future in Denboro to
save him The money must be turned over to the Boston bankers and
the banks bonds once more in the vault where they belonged before he
learned where that money came from Then it would be too late to refuse
and too late to undo what had been done He would have to accept and
I might be able to prevail upon him to keep silent regarding the whole
affair I disliked the check with Coltons name upon it I should have
much preferred the cash but cash it seemed could not be had without
considerable delay and with that bank examiners visit imminent
every moment of time was valuable I folded the check put it in my
pocketbook and hastily scribbling a receipt in pencil at the bottom
of Coltons note replaced the latter in the envelope and handed it to
Johnson who departed

Entering the diningroom I found Dorinda and Lute at the window peering
after the butler

By time exclaimed Lute if I didnt know I should say he was a
bigger bigbug than old Colton himself Look how he struts He sartin is
a dignified lookin man I dont see how he ever come to be just hired
help

Umhm sniffed the cynical Mrs Rogers Well you can get an awful
lot of dignity for its board and lodgin Theres nothin much more
dignified or struts much bettern a rooster but its the hens that lay
the eggs What did he want Roscoe

I made some excuse or other for Mr Johnsons early call and taking
my cap from the rack hurried from the house I went across lots and
running a good part of the way reached the bank just as Sam Wheeler was
sweeping out He expressed surprise at my early arrival and wished to
know what was up

Aint nothin wrong is there Ros asked Sam anxiously I saw by the
paper that the market was feverish again yesterday

Sam was an ambitious youth and being desirous of becoming a banker in
the shortest possible time read the financial page with conscientious
thoroughness I assured him that the markets fever was not
contagiousat least I had not contracted the diseaseand sent him
out to sweep the front steps As soon as he had gone I opened the safe
found to my joy that we had an abundance of currency on hand cashed
the Colton check and locked it securely in the drawer of my own desk So
far I was safe Now to secure Georges safety

He came in soon after looking as if as he had told me he had not
slept for years He bade Sam good morning and then walked over to my
side

Well Ros he asked laying a shaking hand on the desk beside me

Not here George I whispered Come into the directors room

I led the way and he followed me I closed the door behind us took the
thirtyfive hundred dollars in notes from my pocket and laid them on the
table

Theres the money George I said Now youve got just time enough to
catch that nine oclock train for Boston

I thought for a moment he was going to collapse altogether Then he
pounced upon the money counted it with fingers that trembled so he
could scarcely control them and turned to me

RosRos he stammered Where did youhow did youGreat God man
II

There there I interrupted I told you I wasnt a pauper exactly
Put that where you wont lose it and clear out You havent any time to
argue

Butbut Ros I hadnt ought to take this from you I dont see where
you got it and

Thats my business Will you go

I dont know as I ever can pay you Lord knows Ill try all my life
but

I seized his arm George I urged impatiently you fool dont waste
time Get that train do you hear Those bonds must be in that safe by
night Go

The mention of the bonds did what my urging had failed to do He crammed
the bills into his pocket book thrust the latter into an inside pocket
and rushed from the room I followed him as far as the outer door He
was running up the road like a wild man Sam stared after him

For mercy sakes he cried whats the matter with the boss Has he
gone loony

No I said turning back to my desk hes sane enough I guess Hes
after the train

I should think he was after somethin Did you see the face he had on
him If he aint crazy then you and I are thats all Ive got to say

All right Sam I answered drawing a long breath perhaps thats it
Perhaps you and I are the crazy onesone of us at any rate

All that day I worked hard I did not go home for lunch but sent Sam
over to Eldredges store for canned ham and crackers which I ate at my
desk It was a fairly busy day fortunately and I could always find
some task to occupy my mind Lute called at two oclock to inquire why
I had not been home and I told him that Taylor was away and I should be
late for supper He departed shaking his head

Its just as I said he declared youre workin yourself sick
thats what youre doin Youre growin foolish in the head about
work just the same as Dorindy And YOU dont need to youve got money
enough If I had independent means same as youve got I tell you Id
have more sense One sick invalid in the familys enough aint it

No doubt Lute I replied At all events you must take care of your
health Dont YOU work yourself sick

Lute turned on me I try not to he said seriously I try not to
but its a hard job You know what that wife of mine is callatin to
have me do next Wash the hen house window Yes sir wash the window
sos the hens can look at the scenery I presume likely I says to her
says I That beats any foolishness ever I heard Next thing youll want
me to put down a carpet in the pigsty wont ye You would if we kept a
pig I know

What did she say to that I inquired

Oh the land knows Somethin about keepin one pig bein trouble
enough I didnt pay much attention But I shant wash no hens window
now you can bet on that

I shouldnt have bet much on it He went away to spend the next hour in
a political debate at Eldredges and I wrote letters needlessly long
ones Closing time came and Sam went home leaving me to lock up The
train was due at sixtwenty but it was nearly seven before I heard it
whistle at the station I stood at the front window looking up the road
and waiting

I waited only a few minutes but they were long ones Then I saw George
coming not running this time but walking with rapid strides The
crowd waiting on the postoffice steps shouted at him but he paid
no attention He sprang up the steps and entered the bank I stepped
forward and seized his hand One look at his face was enough he had the
bonds I knew it

Ros you here he exclaimed Is it all right The examiner hasnt
showed up

No I answered You have them George

Right in my pocket thank the Lordand you Ros Paine Just let me get
them into that safe and IWhat Youre not going

Yes Im going I congratulate you George I am as glad as you are
Good night

But Ros I want to tell you about it I want to thank you again I
never shall forget    Ros hold on

But I was already at the door Good night I called again and went
out I went straight home ate supper spent a half hour with Mother
and then went to my room and to bed The excitement was over for good
or bad the thing was done beyond recall and I suddenly realized that I
was very tired I fell asleep almost immediately and slept soundly until
morning I was too tired even to think

I had plenty of time to think during the fortnight which followed and
there was enough to think about The lawyer came and the papers were
signed transferring to James W Colton the strip of land over which
Denboro had excited itself for months Each day I sat at my desk
expecting Captain Dean and a delegation of indignant citizens to rush in
and denounce me as a traitor and a turncoat Every time Sam Wheeler met
me at my arrival at the bank I dreaded to look him in the face fearing
that he had learned of my action and was waiting to question me about
it In spite of all my boasts and solemn vows not to permit Big Jim
Colton to obtain the Shore Lane I had sold it to him he could and it
was to be expected that he would close it at once Denboro would make
its just demand upon me for explanations explanations which for George
and Nellies sake I could not give and after that the deluge I was
sitting over a powder mine and I braced myself for the explosion

But hours and days passed and no explosion came The fishcarts rattled
down the Lane without hindrance Except for the little flurry of
excitement caused by the coming wedding at the Dean homestead the
village life moved on its lazy uneventful jog I could not understand
it Why did Colton delay He whose one object in life was to have his
own way had it once more Now that he had it why didnt he make use of
it Why was he holding back Out of pity for me I did not believe it
Much more likely that his daughter whose pride I had dared to offend
had taken the affair in her hands and this agony of suspense was a
preliminary torture a part of my punishment for presuming to act
contrary to her imperial will

I saw her occasionally although I tried my best not to do so Once we
passed each other on the street and I stubbornly kept my head turned in
the other direction I would risk no more looks such as she had given me
when in response to her fathers wouldbe humorous suggestion she had
offered me her congratulations Once too I saw her on the bay I was
aboard the Comfort having just anchored after a short cruise and she
went by in the canoe her newest plaything which had arrived by freight
a few days before A canoe in Denboro Bay was a distinct novelty
probably not since the days of the Indians had one of the light
graceful little vessels floated there and this one carried much comment
among the old salts alongshore It was the general opinion that it was
no craft for salt water

Them things said Zeb Kendrick sagely are all right for ponds
or rivers or cricks where there aint no tide nor sea runnin Float
anywheres where theres a heavy dew they say they will But no darter
of mine should go out past the flats in one of em if I had the say
Its too big a risk

Yup well Zeb you aint got the say I callate observed Thoph
Newcomb And it takes moren say to get a skiff like that one They
tell me the metal work aboard her is silverplatedsilver or gold I
aint sure which Wonder the old man didnt make it solid gold while he
was about it Hed do anything for that girl if she asked him to And
she sartin does handle it like a bird She went by my dory tother
mornin and I swan to man if she and the canoe together want a sight
for sore eyes I set and watched her for twenty minutes

Umyees grunted Zeb And then you charged the twenty minutes in
against the days work quahaugin you was supposed to be doin for me I
suppose

You can take out the ten cents when you pay meif you ever do said
Newcomb gallantly Twas wuth moren that just to look at her

The time had been when I should have agreed with Thoph Sitting in the
canoe bareheaded her hair tossing in the breeze and her rounded arms
swinging the light paddle she was a sight for sore eyes doubtless
But it was not my eyes which were sore just then I watched her for a
moment and then bent over my engine I did not look up again until the
canoe had disappeared beyond the Colton wharf

I did not tell Mother that I had sold the land I intended to do so
each morning I rose with my mind made up to tell her and always I
put off the telling until some other time I knew of course that she
should be told that I ought to tell her rather than to have her learn
the news from others as she certainly would at almost any moment but I
knew too that even to her I could not disclose my reason for
selling I must keep Georges secret as he had kept mine and take the
consequences with a close mouth and as much of my old indifference to
public opinion as I could muster But I realized only too well that
the indifference which had once been real was now only pretense

I have said very little about George Taylors gratitude to me nor his
appreciation of what I had done for him The poor fellow would have
talked of nothing else if I had let him

Youve saved my good name and my life Ros he said over and over
again and not only my life but what is a mighty sight more worth
saving Nellies happiness I dont know how you did it I believe yet
that there is something behind all this that youre keeping something
from me I cant see how considering all youve said to me about your
not being welloff you got that money so quick But I know you dont
want me to talk about it

I dont George I said All I ask of you is just to forget the whole
thing

Forget I shant forget while I live And as soon as ever I can scrape
it together Ill pay you back that loan

He had kept his word so far as telling Nellie of his financial
condition was concerned He had not of course told her of his use of
the bank bonds but he had as he said he would told her that in all
probability he should be left with nothing but his salary

I told her she was free to give me up he said with emotion and
what do you suppose she said to me That she would marry me if she knew
she must live in the poorhouse the rest of her days Yes and be happy
so long as we could be together Well I aint worth it and I told her
so but Ill do my best to be worth something and she shant have to
live in the poorhouse either

I dont think theres much danger of that I said And by the way
George your Louisville and Transcontinental speculation may not be
all loss You may save something out of it There has been considerable
trading in the stock during the past two days It is up half a point
already according to the papers Did you notice it

Yes I noticed it But I tell you Ros I dont care Ill be glad to
get some of my money back of course enough to pay you and Capn Elisha
anyhow but Im so happy to think that Nellie need never know I was a
thief that I dont seem to care much for anything else

Nellie was happy too She came to me and told me of her happiness It
was all on Georges account of course

The poor fellow had lost money in investments she said and he
thought I would not care for him if I found out he was poor He isnt
poor of course but if he was it would make no difference to me I am
so glad to see him without that dreadful worried look on his face that
IIOh you must think me awful silly Roscoe I guess I am I know I
am But you are the only one I can talk to in this way aboutabout him
All Ma wants to talk about now is the wedding and clothes and such and
Pa always treats me as if I was a child I feel almost as if you were
the closest friend I have and I know George feels the same He says you
have helped him out of his troubles I was sure you would that is why I
wrote you that letter We are both SO grateful to you

Their gratitude and the knowledge of their happiness were my sole
consolations in this trying time They kept me from repenting what I
had done It was hard not to repent If Colton had only made known his
purchase and closed the Lane at once while my resolution was red hot
I could have faced the wrath of the village and its inevitable
consequences fairly well I believed but he still kept silent and made
no move I saw him once or twice on one occasion he came into the bank
but he came only to cash a check and did not mention the subject of the
Lane He did not look well to me and I heard him tell Taylor something
about his damned digestion

The wedding day came I as best man was busy and thankful for the
bustle and responsibility They occupied my mind and kept it from
dwelling on other things George worked at the bank until noon getting
ready to leave the institution in my charge and that of Dick Small
Henrys brother who had reported for duty that morning The marriage
was to take place at half past one in the afternoon and the bridal
couple were to go away on the three oclock train The honeymoon trip
was to be a brief one only a week

Every ablebodied native of Denboro man woman and child attended that
wedding I honestly believe It was the best sort of advertising for
Olinda Cahoon and Simeon Eldredge for Olinda had made the gowns worn
by the bride and the brides mother and a number of the younger female
guests and Sim had sold innumerable bottles of a peculiarly penetrating
perfume a large supply of which he had been talked into purchasing by a
Boston traveling salesman

Smell it Ros do ye whispered Sim grinning triumphantly between
the points of a standup collar I give you my word when that
slicktalkin drummer sold me all that perfumery I thought I was stuck
sure and sartin But then I had an idee Every time women folks come
into the store and commenced to talk about the weddin I says to em
says I Cant sell you a couple of handkerchiefs to cry on can I Miss
Soandso Weddins are great places for sheddin tears you know If
I sold em the handkerchiefs all well and good but if they laughed
and said they had a plenty I got out my sample bottle of May Lilock
thats the name of the cologne and asked em to smell of it If you
cry with that on your handkerchief says I all hands will be glad to
have you do it And only twenty cents a bottle You wouldnt believe
how much I sold You can smell this weddin afore you come in sight of
the house cant ye now

You could and you continued to smell it long after you left My best
suit reeked of May Lilac weeks later when I took it out of the closet

Dorinda was there garbed in rustling black alpaca her Sunday gown for
ten years at least and made over and turned four or five times Lute
was on deck cutaway coat high water trousers and purple tie grand
to look upon Alvin Baker and Elnathan Mullet and Alonzo Black and
Thoph Newcomb and Zeb Kendrick were as the Item would say among those
present and if Zebs black cutaway smelled slightly of fish it was at
least a change from the pervading May Lilac

Captain Jed strutted pompously about monarch of the day He greeted me
genially

Hello Ros he said You out here Thought youd be busy overhaulin
Georges runnin riggin and makin sure he was all ready to heave
alongside the parson

I have been I answered I am on my way back there now

All right all right Matildy give me fits for not stayin upstairs
until the startin gun was fired but I told her that between her with
her eyes full of tears and Olindy Cahoon with her mouth full of pins
twas no place for a male man So I cleared out till everything was
shipshape Say Ros he laid his hand on my shoulder and bent to
whisper in my ear Say Ros he said Im glad to see youre takin
my advice

Taking your advice I repeated puzzled

Yes about not playin with fire you know I aint heard of you and
the Princess cruisin together for the past week Thought twas best
not to be too familiar with the Ryal family didnt you Thats right
thats right We cant take chances Weve got Denboro and the Shore
Lane to think about aint we

I did not answer I did not risk looking him in the face

Shes liable to be here most any time I callate he went on Nellie
would insist on invitin her And I must say that to be honest the
present she sent is the finest thats come aboard yet The only thing
Ive got against her is her bad judgment in pickin a father If twant
for that Ihello WhoWhy I believe

There was a commotion among the guests and heads were turned toward the
door The captain started forward I started back She had entered the
room and was standing there looking about her with smiling interest
I had forgotten that considering her friendship with Nellie she was
certain to be invited

She was dressed in a simple but wonderful white gown and wore a bunch
of lilies of the valley at her bosom The doorway was decorated with
sprays of honeysuckle and green boughs and against this background she
made a picture that brought admiring whispers from the people near me
She did not notice me at first and I think I should have escaped by the
side door if it had not been for Sim Eldredge Simeon was just behind me
and he darted forward with outstretched hand

Why how dye do Miss Colton exclaimed Sim Youre just in time
aint ye Let me get you a chair Alvin to Mr Baker who perspiring
beneath the unaccustomed dignity of a starched shirt front occupied a
front seat get up and let Miss Colton set down

She looked in Sims direction and saw me standing beside him I had
no opportunity to avoid her look now as I had done when we met in
the street She saw me and I could not turn away I bowed She did not
acknowledge the bow She looked calmly past me through me I saw or
fancied that I saw astonishment on the faces of those watching us
Captain Jed stepped forward to greet her and I went into the adjoining
room where George was anxiously awaiting me

Good land Ros he exclaimed with a sigh of relief I was beginning
to be afraid youd skipped out and left me to go through it all alone
Say something to brace me up wont you Im scared to death Say with
a wondering glance at my face whats struck YOU You look more upset
than I feel

I believe I ordered him not to be an idiot I know I did not brace him
up to any extent

It was a very pretty wedding At least every one said it was although
they say the same of all weddings I am told Personally I was very
glad when it was over Nellie whispered in my ear as I offered her my
congratulations We owe it all to you Roscoe George said nothing
but the look he gave me as he wrung my hand was significant For a
moment I forgot myself forgot to be envious of those to whom the door
for happiness was not shut After all I had opened the door for these
two and that was something

I walked as far as the corner with Lute and Dorinda Dorindas eyes were
red and her husband commented upon it

I thought a weddin was supposed to be a joyful sort of thing he
said disgustedly Its usually callated to be Yet you and the rest
of the women folks set and cried through the whole of it What in time
was there to cry about

Oh I dont know Luther replied Dorinda in for her an unusually
tolerant tone Perhaps its because weve all been young once and cant
forget it

I dont forget no moren you do I aint so old that I cant remember
that fur back I hope But it dont make me feel like cryin

Well all right We wont argue about it Lets be pleasant as we can
for once

Now that is where Lute should have taken the hint and remained silent
At least he should have changed the subject But he was hot and
uncomfortable and I suspect his Sunday shoes were tight He persisted

Huh he sniffed I dont sees youve given me no sensible reason for
cryin If I recollect right you didnt cry at your own weddin

His wife turned on him She looked him over from head to foot

Didnt I she said tartly Well maybe not But if Id realized what
was happenin to me I should

Lute said I as I parted from them at the corner I am going to the
bank for a little while Then I think I shall take a short run down the
bay in the Comfort Did you fill her tank with gasolene as I asked you
to

Lute stopped short There he exclaimed I knew there was somethin I
forgot Ill do it soons ever I get home

When you get home observed Dorinda firmly youll wash that
henhouse window

Now Dorinda if that aint just like you Dont you hear Roscoe askin
me about that gas Ive had that gas in my head ever since yesterday

Umhm wearily Well I shouldnt think a little extry more or less
would make much difference Never mind dont waste any more on me
Get the gas out of your head if Roscoe wants you to You can wash the
window afterward

Lutes parting words were that he would fill that tank the very first
thing If he hadbut there he didnt



CHAPTER XVIII


The fog had come almost without warning When after leaving the bank
at four oclock or thereabouts I walked down to the shore and pulled my
skiff out to where the Comfort lay at her moorings there had not been
a sign of it Now I was near the entrance of the bay somewhere abreast
Crow Point and all about me was gray wet blankness Sitting in the
stern of the little launch I could see perhaps a scant ten feet beyond
the bow no more

It was the sudden shift of the wind which had brought the fog When I
left the boat house there had been a light westerly breeze This had
died down to a flat calm and then a new breeze had sprung up from the
south blowing the fog before it It rolled across the water as swiftly
as the smoke clouds roll from a freshly lighted bonfire It blotted
Denboro from sight and moved across the bay the long stretch of beach
disappeared the Crow Point light and Ben Smalls freshly whitewashed
dwellings and outbuildings were obliterated In ten minutes the Comfort
was to all appearances alone on a shoreless sea and I was the only
living creature in the universe

I was not troubled or alarmed I had been out in too many fogs on that
very bay to mind this one It was a nuisance because it necessitated
cutting short my voyage although that voyage had no objective point and
was merely an aimless cruise in search of solitude and forgetfulness
The solitude I had found the forgetfulness of course I had not And
now when the solitude was more complete than ever surrounded by
this gray dismalness with nothing whatever to look at to divert my
attention I knew I should be more bitterly miserable than I had been
since I left that wedding And I had been miserable and bitter enough
goodness knows

Home and the village which I had been so anxious to get away from now
looked inviting in comparison I slowed down the engine and with an
impatient growl bent over the little binnacle to look at the compass
and get my bearings before pointing the Comforts nose in the direction
of Denboro Then my growl changed to an exclamation of disgust The
compass was not there I knew where it was It was on my work bench in
the boat house where I had put it myself having carried it there to
replace the cracked glass in its top with a new one I had forgotten it
and there it was

I could get along without it of course but its absence meant delay and
more trouble In a general way I knew my whereabouts but the channel
was winding and the tide was ebbing rapidly I should be obliged to run
slowlyto feel my way so to speakand I might not reach home until
late However there was nothing else to do so I put the helm over
and swung the launch about I sat in the stern sheets listening to
the dreary chockchock of the propeller and peering forward into the
mist The prospect was as cheerless as my future

Suddenly from the wet gray blanket ahead came a call It was a good
way off when I first heard it a call in a clear voice a feminine voice
it seemed to me

Hello

I did not answer I took it for granted that the call was not addressed
to me It came probably from the beach at the Point and might be
Mrs Small hailing her husband though it did not sound like her voice
Several minutes went by before it was repeated Then I heard it again
and nearer

Hello Hellooo Where are you

That was not Mrs Small certainly Unless I was away off in my
reckoning the Point was at my right and the voice sounded to the left
It must come from some craft afloat in the bay though before the fog
set in I had seen none

Helloo Hello the motor boat

Hello I answered Boat ahoy Where are you

Here I am The voice was nearer still Where are you Dont run into
me

I shifted my helm just a bit and peered ahead I could see nothing The
fog was thicker than ever if that were possible

Where are you repeated the unseen voyager and to my dismay the hail
came from the right this time

Dont move I shouted Stay where you are I will keep shouting   
LOOK OUT

Out of the fog to starboard a long dark shadow shot silent and swift
It was moving directly across the Comforts bow I jammed the wheel over
and the launch swung off but not enough It struck the canoe for it
was a canoe a glancing blow and heeled it down to the waters edge
There was a scrape a little scream and two hands clutched at the
Comforts rail I let go the wheel sprang forward and seized the owner
of the hands about the waist The canoe half full of water disappeared
somewhere astern I swung Mabel Colton aboard the launch

I think she spoke first I do not remember saying anything and I think
it must have been at least a full minute before either of us broke
the silence She lay or sat upon the cockpit floor her shoulders
supported by the bench surrounding it just where I had placed her after
lifting her over the rail I knelt beside her staring as if she were a
spirit instead of a real and rather damp young lady And she stared at
me When she spoke her words were an echo of my thought

It IS you she gasped

Yes

Thisthis is the third time

Yes

Another interval of silence Then she spoke once more and her tone was
one expressing intense conviction

This she said slowly is getting to be positively ridiculous

I did not deny it I said nothing

She sat up My canoe she faltered

The mention of the canoe brought me partially to my senses I realized
that I was kneeling on the deck of a launch that was pounding its way
through the fog with no one at the helm I sprang to my feet and seized
the wheel That my doing so would be of little use considering that the
Comfort might be headed almost anywhere by this time did not occur to
me Miss Colton remained where she was

My canoe she repeated

I was awakening rapidly I looked out into the mist and shook my head

I am afraid your canoe has gone I said And then as the thought
occurred to me for the first time Youre not hurt I hope I dragged
you aboard here rather roughly I am afraid

No I am not hurt Butwhere are we

I dont know exactly Somewhere near the mouth of the bay that is
all I can be sure of You are certain you are not hurt You must be wet
through

She got upon her feet and leaning over the Comforts rail gazed about
her

I am all right she answered But dont you know where you are

Before the fog caught me I was nearly abreast the Point I was running
at half speed up the channel when I heard your hail Where were you

I was just beyond your boat house out in the middle of the bay I had
come out for a paddle before dinner I did not notice the fog until it
was all about me Then I think I must have been bewildered I thought
I was going in the direction of home but I could not have beennot if
you were abreast the Point I must have been going directly out to sea

She shivered

You are wet I said anxiously There is a storm coat of mine in the
locker forward Wont you put that about your shoulders It may prevent
your taking cold

No thank you I am not wet at all or at least only my feet and the
bottom of my skirt I shall not take cold

But

Please dont worry I am all right or shall be as soon as I get home

I am very sorry about your canoe

It doesnt matter

Her answers were short now There was a different note in her voice I
knew the reason of the change Now that the shock and the surprise of
our meeting were over she and I were resuming our old positions She was
realizing that her companion was the common fellow whose charming and
cultivated society was not necessary to her happiness the fellow to
whom she had scornfully offered congratulations and whom she had cut
dead at the Deans that very afternoon I made no more suggestions and
expressed no more sympathy

I will take you home at once I said curtly

If you please

That ended conversation for the time She seated herself on the bench
near the forward end of the cockpit and kept her head turned away from
me I with one hand upon the wheela useless procedure for I had no
idea where the launch might be headedlooked over the rail and listened
to the slow and regular beat of the engine Suddenly the beat grew less
regular The engine barked hiccoughed barked again but more faintly
and then stopped altogether

I knew what was the matter Before I reached the gasolene tank and
unscrewed the little cover I knew it I thrust in the gauge stick and
heard it strike bottom drew it out and found it as I expected dry
to the very tip I had trusted like an imbecile to Lute Lute had
promised to fill that tank the very first thing and he had not kept
his promise

There was not a pint of gasolene aboard the Comfort and it would be my
cheerful duty to inform my passenger of the fact

She did not wait for me to break the news She saw me standing there
holding the gauge stick in my hand and she asked the natural question

What is the matter she demanded

I swallowed the opinion of Mr Rogers which was on the tip of my tongue

I am sorry I stammered butbutwell we are in trouble I am
afraid

In trouble she said coldly What trouble do you mean

Yes The fact is we have run out of gasolene I told my man Rogers
to fill the tank and he hasnt done it

She leaned forward to look at me

Hasnt done it she repeated You meanwhy this boat cannot go
without gasolene can it

Not very well no

Thenthen what are we going to do

Anchor and wait if I can

Wait But I dont wish to wait I wish to be taken home at once

I am sorry but I am afraid that is impossible

I was on my way forward to where the anchor lay in the bow She rose
and stepped in front of me

Mr Paine

Yes Miss Colton

I tell you I do not wish you to anchor this boat

I am sorry but it is the only thing to do under the circumstances

I do not wish it Stop I tell you I will not have you anchor

Miss Colton we must do one of two things either anchor or drift And
if we drift I cannot tell you where we may be carried

I dont care

I do

Yes with scornful emphasis I presume you do

What do you mean

I meannever mind what I mean

But as I have explained to you the gasolene

Nonsense Do you suppose I believe that ridiculous story

Believe it I gazed at her uncomprehendingly Believe it I
repeated Dont you believe it

No

Miss Colton do you mean that you think I am not telling you the truth
That I am lying

Well fiercely and if I did would it be so astonishing
consideringconsidering the TRUTHS you have told me before

I made no further effort to pass her Instead I stepped back

Would you mind telling me I demanded with deliberate sarcasm what
possible reason you think I might have for wishing to keep you here

I shall tell you nothing Andand I will not have you anchor this
boat

Is it your desire then that we driftthe Lord knows where

I desire you to start that engine and take me home

I cannot start the engine

I dont believe it

For a moment I hesitated Then I did what was perhaps the most senseless
thing I ever did in all my life which is saying considerable I turned
my back on her and on the anchor and seated myself once more in the
stern sheets And we drifted

I do not know how long we drifted before I regained my sanity It must
have been a good while When I first returned to my seat by the wheel it
was with the firm determination to allow the Comfort to drift into the
bottomless pit rather than to stir hand or foot to prevent it In fact
that particular port looked rather inviting than otherwise Any torments
it might have in store could not be worse than those I had undergone
because of this girl I sat silent with my gaze fixed upon the
motionless engine I heard my passenger move once or twice but I did
not look at her

What brought me to my senses was the boat hook which had been lying on
the seat beside me suddenly falling to the floor I started and looked
over the rail The water as much of it as I could see through the fog
was no longer flat and calm There were waves all about us not big
ones but waves nevertheless long regular swells in the trough of
which the Comfort rocked lazily There was no wind to kick up a sea
This was a ground swell such as never moved in Denboro Bay While I sat
there like an idiot the tide had carried us out beyond the Point

With an exclamation I sprang up and hurried forward Miss Colton was
sitting where I had left her

What is it she asked What are you going to do

I am going to anchor I said

I do not wish you to anchor

I cant help that I must Please stand aside Miss Colton

She tried to prevent me but I pushed her away not too gently I am
afraid and clambered forward to the bow where the anchor lay upon its
coil of line I threw it overboard The line ran out to its very end and
I waited expectantly for the jerk which would tell me that the anchor
had caught and was holding But no jerk came Reaching over the bow I
tried the line It was taut and heavy Then I knew approximately how far
we had drifted We were beyond the shoal making out from Crow Point over
the deep water beyond My anchor rope was not long enough to reach the
bottom

Still I was not alarmed I was provoked at my own stubbornness which had
gotten us into this predicament and more angry than ever at the person
who was the cause of that stubbornness But I was not frightened There
were other shoals further out and I left the anchor as it was hoping
that it might catch and hold on one of them I went back once more to my
seat by the wheel

Then followed another interval of silence and inaction From astern and
a good way off sounded the notes of a bell From the opposite direction
came a low groan indescribably mournful and lonely

My passenger heard it and spoke

What was that she demanded in a startled tone

The fog horn at Mackerel Island the island at the mouth of Wellmouth
harbor I answered

And that bell

That is the fog bell at Crow Point

At Crow Point Why it cant be Crow Point is in Denboro Bay and that
bell is a long way behind us

Yes We are a mile or more outside the Point now The tide has carried
us out

Carried usDo you mean that we are out at sea

Not at sea exactly We are in Cape Cod Bay

Butwhy we are still drifting arent we I thought you had
anchored

I tried to but I was too late The water is too deep here for the
anchor to reach bottom

Butbut what are you going to do

Nothing at present There is nothing I can do Sit down please

Nothing Nothing Do you mean that you propose to sit there and let us
be carried out to sea

We shall not be carried far There is no wind When the tide turns we
shall probably be carried in again

But sharply why dont you do something Cant you row

I have only one oar

But you must do something You MUST IIIt is late it is growing
dark My people What will they think

I am sorry Miss Colton

Sorry You are not sorry If you were you would do something instead
of sitting there asas if you enjoyed it I believe you do enjoy it
You are doing it purposely toto

To what pray

Never mind

But I do mind You have accused me of lying Miss Colton and of
keeping you here purposely What do you mean by it

I mean thatthatOh you know what I mean You hate me and you hate
my father and you are trying toto punish us forfor

I had heard enough I did not propose to hear any more

Miss Colton I interrupted sternly stop this is silly I assure
you that I am as anxious to end thisexcursionof ours as you can be
Your being afloat in Denboro Bay in a canoe was your own recklessness
and not my fault Neither was it my fault that the launch collided with
your canoe I called to you not to move but to stay where you were
And moreover if you had permitted me to anchor when I first attempted
to do so we should not be in this scrape I shall get you out of it just
as quick as I can In order that I may do so I shall expect you to stop
behaving like a child and do as I tell you Sit down on that bench and
keep still

This had the effect I meant it to She looked at me as if she could not
believe she had heard aright But I met her gaze squarely and with a
shudder of disgust or fear I do not know which she turned her back
upon me and was silent I went forward to the cuddy found the tin horn
which until that moment I had forgotten and returning blew strident
blasts upon it at intervals There was little danger of other craft
being in our vicinity but I was neglecting no precautions

The bell at Crow Point sounded further and further astern The twilight
changed to dusk and the dusk to darkness The fog was as thick as ever
It was nearly time for the tide to turn

Suddenly there was a jerk the launch quivered and swung about

Oh what was that demanded Miss Colton shortly

The anchor I answered We have reached the outer shoal

And hesitatingly shall we stay here

Yes unless

Unless what

Unless    Hush listen

There was an odd rushing sound from the darkness astern a sort of hiss
and low watery roar I rushed to the bow and dragged the anchor inboard
with all my strength Then I ran to the wheel I had scarcely reached it
when I felt a hand on my arm

What is it asked the young lady her voice quivering Oh what is
it

Wind I answered There is a squall coming Sit down Sit down

Butbut

Sit down

She hesitated and I seized her arm and forced her down upon the bench
beside me I threw the helm over The rushing sound grew nearer Then
came a blast of wind which sent my cap flying overboard and the fog
disappeared as if it had been a cloth snatched away by a mighty hand
Above us was a black sky with stars showing here and there between
flying clouds and about us were the waves already breaking into foam
upon the shoal

The Comfort rocked and wallowed in the trough We were being driven by
the wind away from the shoal but not fast enough Somehow or other we
must get out of that dangerous neighborhood I turned to my companion
She had not spoken since the squall came

Miss Colton I said give me your hands

I presume she could not imagine what I meant No doubt too my tone and
the request frightened her She hesitated I seized her hands and placed
them on the spokes of the wheel

I want you to hold that wheel just as it is I commanded I must go
forward and get steerage way on this craft somehow or we shall capsize
Can you hold it do you think

Yes II think so

You must

I left her went to the cuddy and dragged out the small canvas tarpaulin
which I used to cover the engine at night With this a cod line the
boathook and my one oar I improvised a sort of jury rig which I tied
erect at the forward end of the cockpit Then I went aft and took the
wheel again The tarpaulin made a poor apology for a sail but I hoped
it might answer the purpose well enough to keep the Comfort before the
wind

It did Tacking was of course out of the question but with the gale
astern the launch answered her helm and slid over the waves instead of
rolling between them I sighed in relief Then I remembered my passenger
sitting silent beside me She did not deserve consideration but I
vouchsafed a word of encouragement

Dont be frightened I said It is only a stiff breeze and this boat
is seaworthy We are all right now

But why did you take up the anchor

By way of answer I pointed aft over the stern In the darkness the froth
of the shoal gleamed white I felt her shudder as she looked

Where are we going nowplease she asked a moment later

We are headed for the Wellmouth shore It is the only direction we can
take If this wind holds we shall land in a few hours It is all deep
water now There are no more shoals

But anxiously can we land when we reach there Isnt it a bad
coast

Not very If we can make Mackerel Island we may be able to get ashore
at the light or anchor in the lee of the land It is all right Miss
Colton I am telling you the truth Strange as it may seem to you I
really am

I could not help adding the last bit of sarcasm She understood She
drew away on the bench and asked no more questions

On drove the Comfort The first fierceness of the squall had passed and
it was now merely what I had called it a stiff breeze Out here in the
middle of the bay the waves were higher and we shipped some spray over
the quarter The air was sharp and the chill penetrated even my thick
jacket

You must be cold I said Arent you

No

But you must be Take the wheel a moment

I am not cold

Take the wheel

She took it I groped about in the cuddy again got out my storm coat
an old pea jacket which I wore on gunning expeditions and brought it to
her

Slip this on I said

I do not care for it

Put it on

Mr Paine haughtily I tell you     oh

I had wrapped the coat about her shoulders and fastened the upper
button

Now sit down on the deck here I ordered Here by my feet You will
be below the rail there and out of the wind

To my surprise she obeyed orders this time without even a protest I
smiled grimly To see her obey suited my humor It served her right I
enjoyed ordering her about as if I were mate of an oldtime clipper and
she a foremast hand She had insulted me once too often and she should
pay for it Out here social position and wealth and family pride counted
for nothing Here I was absolute master of the situation and she
knew it All her life she would remember it the humiliation of being
absolutely dependent upon me for life and safety and warmth I looked
down at her crouching at my feet and then away over the black water
The Comfort climbed wave after wave

Mr Paine

The tone was very low but I heard it

I came out of my waking dreamit was not a pleasant oneand answered

Yes I said

Where are we

We are making fair progress everything considered Are you warmer
now

Yesthank you

She said no more nor did I Except for the splash of the spray and the
flapping of the loose ends of the tarpaulin it was quiet aboard the
Comfort Quiet except for an odd sound in the shadow by my knee I
stooped and listened

Miss Colton I said quickly What is it

No answer Yet I heard the sound again

What is it Miss Colton I repeated What is the matter Why are you
crying

II am NOT crying indignantly And on the very heels of the denial
came a stifled sob

That sob went to my heart A great lump rose in my own throat My brain
seemed to be turning topsyturvy A moment before it had been filled
with bitterness and resentment and vengeful thoughts Now these had
vanished and in their place came crowding other and vastly different
feelings She was crying sobbing there alone in the dark at my feet
And I had treated her like a brute

Miss Colton I pleaded in an agony of repentance what is it Is
there anything I can do Are you still cold Take this other coat the
one I have on I dont need it really I am quite warm

I am not cold

But

Oh please dont speak to me PLEASE

I closed my lips tightly and clutched the wheel with both hands Oh I
had been a brute a brute I should have known that she was not herself
that she was frightened and nervous and distraught I should have been
considerate and forbearing I should have remembered that she was only a
girl hysterical and weak Instead I had

Miss Colton I begged please dont Please

No answer only another sob I tried again

I have been a cad I cried I have treated you abominably I dont
expect you to forgive me but

II am so frightened The confession was a soliloquy I think not
addressed to me at all But I heard it and forgot everything else I let
go of the wheel altogether and bent over her both hands outstretched
tothe Lord knows what I was not responsible just then

But while I still hesitated while my hands were still in the air above
her before they touched her I was brought back to sanity with a rude
shock A barrel or so of cold water came pouring over the rail and
drenched us both The launch being left without a helmsman had swung
into the trough of the sea and this was the result

I am not really sure what happened in the next few seconds I must I
imagine have seized the wheel with one hand and my passenger with
the other At any rate when the smoke so to speak had cleared the
Comfort was headed on her old course once more I was back on the bench
by the wheel Mabel Coltons head was on my shoulder and I was telling
her over and over that it was all right now there was no danger we
were perfectly safe and various inanities of that sort

She was breathing quickly but she sobbed no more I was glad of that

You are sure you are not hurt I asked anxiously

Yesyes I think so she answered faintly What was it II
thought we were sinking

So did I for a moment It was all my fault as usual I let go the
wheel

Did you Why

I dont know why This was untrue I did But you are wet through I
added remorsefully And I havent another dry wrap aboard

Never mind You are as wet as I am

Yes but _I_ dont mind I am used to it But you

I am all right I was a little faint at first I think but I am
better now She raised her head and sat up Where are we she asked

We are within a few miles of the Wellmouth shore That light ahead
is the Mackerel Island light We shall be there in a little while The
danger is almost over

She shivered

You are cold I cried Of course you are If I only had another coat
or something It is all my fault

Dont say that reproachfully Where should I have been if it had not
been for you I was paddling directly out toward those dreadful shoals
Then you came just as you have done before and saved me And in a
wondering whisper I knew it was you

I did not ask her what she meant I seemed to understand perfectly

Yes I said

But I tell you I knew it was you she repeated I did not knowI
did not suspect until the moment before the collision before the launch
came in sightthen all at once I knew

Yes That was when I knew

She turned and gazed at me

YOU knew she gasped hysterically Whywhat do you mean

I cant explain it Just before your canoe broke through the fog I
knew that is all

It was unexplainable but it was true Call it telepathy or what you
willI do not know what it wasI am certain only that although I had
not recognized her voice I had suddenly known who it was that would
come to me out of the fog And she too had known I felt again with
an almost superstitious thrill that feeling of helplessness which had
come over me that day of the fishing excursion when she rode through the
bushes to my side It was as if she and I were puppets in the hands of
some Power which was amusing itself at our expense and would have its
way no matter how we might fight against it

She spoke as if she were struggling to awaken from a dream

But it cant be she protested It is impossible Why should you and
I

I dont know    Unless

Unless what

I closed my lips on the words that were on the tip of my tongue That
reason was more impossible than all else

Nothing I stammered

She did not repeat her question I saw her face a dainty silhouette
against the foam alongside turned away from me I gazed at it until
I dared gaze no longer Was I losing my senses altogether IRos
Painethe man whose very name was not his own I must not think such
thoughts I scarcely dared trust myself to speak and yet I knew that I
must This silence was too dangerous I took refuge in a commonplace

We are getting into smoother water I said It is not as rough as it
was do you think

If she heard the remark she ignored it She did not turn to look at me
After a moment she said in a low voice

I cant understand

I supposed her to be still thinking of our meeting in the fog

I cannot understand myself I answered I presume it was a
coincidence like our meeting at the pond

She shook her head I did not mean that she said I mean that I
cannot understand how you can be so kind to me After what I said and
the way I have treated you it is wonderful

I was obliged to wait another moment before I could reply I clutched
the wheel tighter than ever

The wonderful part of it all I said earnestly is that you should
even speak to me after my treatment of you here tonight I was a
brute I ordered you about as if

Hush Dont please dont Think of what I said to you Will you
forgive me I have been so ungrateful You saved my life over and over
again and II

Stop Dont do that If you do I shallMiss Colton please

She choked back the sob Tell me she said a moment later this time
looking me directly in the face why did you sell my father that land

It was my turn to avoid her look I did not answer

I know it was not because of the moneythe price I mean Father told
me that you refused the five thousand he offered and would accept only
a part of it thirtyfive hundred I think he said I should have known
that the price had nothing to do with it even if he had not told me
But why did you sell it

I would have given all I had or ever expected to have in this world
to tell her the truth For the moment I almost hated George Taylor

Oh I thought I might as well give in then as later I answered with
a shrug It was no use fighting the inevitable

That was not it I know it was not If it had been you would have taken
the five thousand And I know too that you meant what you said when
you told me you never would sell I have known it all the time I know
you were telling me the truth

I was astonished You do I cried Why you said

Dont I know what I said and I am so ashamed I did not mean it
really For a moment there in the library when Father first told me I
thought perhaps youbut I did not really think it And when he told me
the price I KNEW Wont you tell me why you sold

I cant I wish I could

I believe I can guess

I started You can GUESS I repeated

Yes I think you wanted the money for some purpose some need which
you had not foreseen And I do not believe it was for yourself at all I
think it was for some one else Wasnt that it

I could not reply I tried to tried to utter a prompt denial but the
words would not come Her guess was so close to the truth that I could
only stammer and hesitate

It was she said I thought so For your mother wasnt it

No no Miss Colton you are wrong I

I am not wrong Never mind I suppose it is a secret Perhaps I shall
find out some day But will you forgive me for being so hateful Can
you What is the matter

Nothingnothing Iyou are too good to me that is all I dont
deserve it

Hush And we will be friends again

Yes     Oh no no I must not think of it It is impossible

Must not think of it When I ask you to Cant you forgive me after
all

There was nothing to forgive

Yes there was a great deal Is there something else Are you still
angry with me because of what I said that afternoon at the gate

No of course not

It was hateful of me I know But I could see that you wished to avoid
me and I was provoked Besides you have punished me for that You have
snubbed me twice since sir

_I_ snubbed YOU

Yestwice Once when we met in the street You deliberately turned
away and would not look at me And once when I passed you in the canoe
You saw meI know you didbut you cut me dead That is why I did not
return your bow today at the wedding

But you had saidI thought

I know I had said horrid things I deserved to be snubbed There now
I have confessed Maynt we be friends

I    Oh no we must not for your sake I

For my sake But I wish it Why not

I turned on her Cant you see I said despairingly Look at the
difference between us You are what you are and I

She interrupted me Oh she cried impatiently how dare you speak
so How dare you believe that money andall the rest of it influences
me in my friendships Do you think I care for that

I did not mean money alone But even that Miss Colton that evening
when we returned from the trip after weakfish you and your father and
I I heardI did not mean to hear but I didwhat your mother said when
she met you She said she had warned you against trusting yourself to
that common fellow meaning me That shows what she thinks She was
right in a way she was perfectly right Now you see what I mean by
saying that friendship between us is impossible

I had spoken at white heat Now I turned away It was settled She must
understand now

Mr Paine

Yes Miss Colton

I am sorry you heard that Mothershe is my mother and I love herbut
she says foolish things sometimes I am sorry you heard that but since
you did I wish you had heard the rest

The rest

Yes I answered her by suggesting that she had not been afraid to trust
me in the care of VictorMr Carver She answered that she hoped I did
not mean to compare Mr Carver with you And I said

Yes You said

I said the tone was low but I heard every syllable I said she was
right there was no comparison

You said THAT

Yes

You said it And you meant

I meantI think I meant that I should not be afraid to trust you
alwaysanywhere

Where were my good resolutionsmy stern reasons to remember who and
what I wasto be sane no matter at what cost to myself I do not know
where they were then I did not care I seized her hand It trembled
but she did not draw it away

Mabel I cried Mabel

BUMP

The Comfort shook as the bow of a dory scraped along her starboard
quarter A big red hand clasped the rail and its mate brandished a
goodsized club before my eyes

Now said a determined voice Ive got ye at last This time Ive
caught ye dead to rights Now by godfreys youll pay me for them
lobsters



CHAPTER XIX


If I had been giving undivided attention to my combined duties as
steersman and pilot instead of neglecting them for other and more
engrossing matters I should doubtless have seen the dory before As
it was I had not seen it at all nor heard the oars It had sneaked up
on the Comfort out of the darkness and its occupant had laid us aboard
as neatly as you please

I was to say the least startled and surprised I dodged the
threatening club and turned a dazed face toward the person brandishing
it He appeared to be a middlesized elderly person in oilskins and
souwester and when he spoke a gray whisker wagged above the chin strap
of the souwester

Who in blazes are you I demanded as soon as I could get the words
together

Never you mind that You know who I be all right enough Be you goin
to pay me for them lobsters Thats what _I_ want to know

What lobsters

Them lobsters youve been stealin out of my pots for the last
fortnight

_I_ have been stealing

Yes you I been layin for you all night long I dont know who
you be but youll pay for them lobsters or come along with me to the
lockup one or tother

I looked about over the water The light toward which I had been trying
to steer blazed dead ahead surprisingly near and bright Except for
that however there was no sign of anything except darkness and waves

Look here my man I said I havent stolen your lobsters but

I know better I dont know who you be but Id know you was a thief if
I run acrost you in prayermeetin Just to look at you is enough

I heard a hysterical giggle from the bench beside me Evidently the
person with the club heard it too for he leaned forward to look

So theres two of ye eh he said Well by godfreys I dont care if
theres a million Youll pay for them lobsters or go to the lockup

I laughed aloud Very well I said I am agreeable

Youre agreeable What do you mean by that This aint no laughin
matter Ill tell you that

I laughed again I dont care what you tell me I observed And if
you will take us somewhere ashoreto the lockup or anywhere elseI
shall be much obliged

The occupant of the dory seemed to be puzzled He leaned forward once
more

What sort of talk is that he demanded Wheres my lobsters   
Hey What I swan to man I believe one of yes a woman Have the
females turned thieves too

I dont know See here my friend my name is Paine and Im the only
lobster aboard this craft This lady and I belong in Denboro My launch
has run out of gasolene and we have been drifting about the bay since
five oclock Now for heavens sake dont talk any more but take us
to the lockup and be quick about it

The unknown paid no attention to my entreaty Instead he leaned still
further over the Comforts rail The dory careened until I expected to
see her capsize

I swan to man he muttered I swan to man Taint possible Im
mistook

It scarcely seems possible I admit But Im afraid it is true

I heard the club fall with a clatter

Mygodfreys Do you mean to say From Denboro Out of gasolene
Whywhy youve got sail up

Nothing but a tarpaulin on an oar

And youve been cruisin all night Through the fogthe squalland
all

Yes wearily yesyesyes

Butbut aint you drownded

Not quite If you dont let go of that rail we shall be soon

Driftin all night Aint you wet through

Yes Might I suggest that we postpone the rest of the catechism until
we reachthe lockup

This suggestion apparently was accepted Our captor suddenly became very
much alive

Give me a line he ordered Anchor ropell do Where is it up
forard

He pawed the dory along hand over hand until he reached the Comforts
bow I heard the thump of the anchor as he dragged it into the dory
Then came the creak and splash of oars His voice sounded from somewhere
ahead

Head for the light he shouted Im goin to tow you in

In where

In ashore Thats Mackrel Island light My names Atwood Im keeper
of it

I turned to my passenger

It looks I said as if our voyage was almost over

And it was Mr Atwood had a tough job on his hands towing the launch
But the makeshift sail helped some and I did my best to steer in his
wake Miss Colton and I had no opportunity to talk The gentleman in
the dory kept up a running fire of remarks shouted between grunts
and embroidered with cheerful profanity We caught fragments of the
monologue

I swan to manughI thought ye was thieves for sartin Some
everlastin damughhave been sneakin out nights and haulin my
lobster pots Ughif Id caught em I was callatin toughbreak
theirughughThis dory pulls like a coal bargeIWet through
aint ye And froze I callateUghand hungry tooUghughMy old
womans tendin light SheughHere we be Easy now

A low shore loomed black across our bows Above it the lighthouse rose
a white chalk mark against the sky with a red glare at its upper end
Mr Atwood sprang overboard with a splash The launch was drawn in at
the end of its anchor rope until its keel grated on the sand

Now then said our rescuer Here we be Made harbor at last though I
did think Id crack my back timbers afore we done it Ill tote the lady
ashore You can wade cant ye

I could and I was very glad of the opportunity I turned to take Miss
Colton in my arms but she avoided me

Here I am Mr Atwood she said Oh thank you

She was swung into the air and moved shoreward to the accompaniment of
mighty splashings

Dont be scart maam said Mr Atwood I shant let ye drop Lord
sakes Ive toted more women in my time than you can shake a stick at
Theres more dathat is theres more summer folks try to land on this
island at low tide than there is moskeeters and theres more of them
than theres fiddles inHi come on you Mr Whatsyourname
Straight as you go

I came on wading through eelgrass and water until I reached a sandy
beach A moment later we stood before a white door in a very white
little house Mr Atwood opened the door revealing a cosy little
sitting room and a grayhaired plump pleasantfaced woman sitting in a
rocking chair beside a table with a lamp upon it

Hello Betsy bellowed our rescuer stamping his wet rubber boots on
the braided mat Got company come to supperor breakfast or whatever
you want to call it This is Mr Paine from Denboro This is his wife
Mrs Paine Theyve been cruisin all the way from Cape Cod to Kamchatky
in a motor boat with no power to it Dont that beat the Old Scratch
hey

The plump woman rose without a trace of surprise as if having company
drop in at three oclock in the morning was nothing out of the ordinary
and came over to us beaming with smiles

Im real glad to see you Mrs Paine she exclaimed And your
husband too You must be froze to death Set right down while I fix up
a room for you and hunt up some dry things for you to put on I wont be
but a minute

Before I could offer explanations or do more than stammer thanks
and rather incoherent ones at that she had bustled out of the room I
caught one glimpse of Mabel Coltons face it was crimson from neck to
brow Mrs Paine Your husband I was grateful to the doughty Mr
Atwood but just then I should have enjoyed choking him

The light keeper quite unaware that his unfortunate misapprehension of
the relationship between his guests might be embarrassing was doing his
best to make us feel at home

Take off your boots Mr Paine he urged The old ladyll fetch you
a pair of my slippers and some socks in a minute Shell make your wife
comftable too Shes a great hand at makin folks comftable I tell
her shed make a cake of ice feel to home on a hot stove She beats

The old lady herself interrupted him entering with a bottle in one
hand and a lamp in the other

Joshua she said warningly

Well what is it Betsy

Be careful how you talk

Talk with a wink at me I want goin to say nothin

Yes you was Mrs Paine you mustnt mind him He used to go mate on
a fishin schooner and from all I can learn they use pretty strong
language aboard these boats

Pick it up same as a poll parrot cut in her husband Comes natural
when youre handlin wet trawl line in February Cant seem to get no
comfort out of anything milder

Hes a real goodhearted man Joshua is and a profession church
member but he does swear moren he ought to But as I tell the
minister he dont mean nothin by it

Not a damn thing said Mr Atwood reassuringly The bottle it
appeared contained Jamaica ginger a liberal dose of which Mrs Atwood
insisted upon our taking as a precaution against catching cold

Theres nothin better she said

You bet there aint this from the lightkeeper A body cant get
within forty fathoms of a cold with a swallow of that amidships Its
hotter than

Joshua

The Fourth of July concluded her husband triumphantly

And now Mrs Paine went on the lady of the house your rooms all
ready Ive laid out some dry things for you on the bed and some of
Joshuas too You and your husband

I thought it high time to explain

The lady is not my wife I said quickly

She aint Why I thought Joshua said

Heermade a mistake She is Miss Colton a summer resident and
neighbor of mine in Denboro

Sho you dont say Thats just like you Joshua

Just like me Well howd I know I beg your pardon Miss Im sure
Shant beg your husI mean Mr Paines pardon he ought to thank me for
the compliment Haw haw

Miss Colton herself made the next remark

If my room is ready Mrs Atwood she said without even a glance in
my direction I think I will go to it I AM rather wet

Wet Land sakes yes I guess you be Come right in Joshua take them
clothes of yours into our room and let Mr Paine put em on

Her husband obeyed orders After I was alone in the room to which
he conducted me and enjoying the luxury of dry socks I heard him
justifying his mistake in stentorian tones

I couldnt help it Betsy I heard him say I took it for granted
they was married When I hove alongside that motor boat they was
asettin close up together in the stern sheets and so of course I
thought

You hadnt any business to You made that poor young lady blush
somethin dreadful Most likely theyre just keepin companyor
engaged or somethin You ought to be more careful

I wondered if the young lady herself heard all this I didnt see how
she could help it

Kinderhearted people than these two never lived I do believe It was
after three in the morning both had been up all night we were absolute
strangers to them and yet without a word of complaint they gave the
remainder of the hours before daylight to making us comfortable When I
dressed as much of myself as a suit of Mr Atwoodshis Sunday best I
presumewould cover and with a pair of carpet slippers about the size
and shape of toy ferry boats on my feet emerged from the bedroom I
found the table set in the kitchen the teapot steaming and Mrs
Atwood cooking spider bread on the stove When Miss Colton looking
surprisingly presentableconsidering that she too was wearing
borrowed apparel four sizes too large for hermade her appearance we
sat down to a simple meal which I think was the most appetizing I ever
tasted

The Atwoods were bursting with curiosity concerning our getting adrift
in the motor boat I described the adventure briefly When I told of
Lutes forgetfulness in the matter of gasolene the lightkeeper thumped
the table

There by godfreys he exclaimed I could see it comin That
fellers for all the world like a cook I had once aboard the Ezry H
Jones That cook was the biggest numskull that ever drawed the breath
of life Always forgettin somethin he was and always at the most
inconvenient time Once if youll believe it I had a skipper of
another vessel come aboard and wishin to be sort of hospitable as you
might say I offered him a glass of rum

Joshua

Oh its all right Betsy This was years ago Im as good a teetotaler
now as you be and I never was what youd call a soak But Ive SEEN
fellersWhy I knew one once that used to go to bed in the dark He
was so full of alcohol he didnt dast to light a match fear hed catch
afire Fact He was eightyodd then and he lived to be nigh a hundred
Preserved you understand same as one of them specimens in a museum
Hed kept forever I callate if he hadnt fell off the dock The water
fixed him he wasnt used to it He was the wust

Never mind him Stick to the cook

Yes yes Well I sent that cook for the rum and when he fetched it I
thought it smelt funny And when I TASTED itgodfreys Twas bay rum
yes sir bay rum same as they put on your hair You see hed forgot
to buy any rum when we was in our last port and havin the bay rum
along he fetched that Twas SOME kind of rum and that was enough for
him I WAS mad but that visitin skipper he didnt care Drank it down
and smacked his lips Im a State of Maine man he says and thats
a prohibition state This tastes like home he says If you dont mind
Ill help myself to another I dont mind says I but Im sorry I
aint got any hairile If I had you might have a barbershop toddy
Yes sir Hoho thats what I said But he didnt mind He was

And so on The yarns were not elegant but as he told them they were
funny Mabel Colton laughed as heartily as the rest of us She appeared
to be in fine spirits She talked with the Atwoods answered their
questions and ate the hot spider bread and butter as if she had never
tasted anything as good But with me she would not talk Whenever I
addressed a remark to her she turned it with a laugh and her next
speech was pretty certain to be addressed to the lightkeeper or his
wife As for our adventure in the launch that she treated as a joke

Want you awful scared when that squall struck so sudden inquired
Mrs Atwood

Dreadfully

Humph this from Joshua I callate Mr Paine was some scart too
What did you do Mr Paine

I rigged that canvas on the oar as soon as possible I answered

Umhm That was good judgment

Tell me Mr Atwood asked the young lady innocently are all
seafaring men very dictatorial under such circumstances

Verywhich

I mean do they order people about and make them do all sorts of things
whether they wish to or not

Sartin Godfreys I never asked nobody what they wished aboard the Ezry
H Jones

And do they tell them to sit down and keep still

Genrally they tell em to get up and keep movin If they dont they
start em pretty livelywith a ropes end

I see Even when they areladies

Ladies Godfreys we never had but one woman aboard the Ezry Had the
skippers wife one vyage but nobody ever ordered her around any to
speak of She was six feet tall and weighed two hundred All hands was
scart to death of her

Suppose she had been ordered to sit down and keep still what do you
think would have happened

Dont know If twas one of the hands I guess likely shed have hove
him overboard If twas the skipper I shouldnt wonder if shed have
knocked him downafter she got over the surprise of his darin to do
such a thing She had HIM trained I tell ye

Miss Colton thinks me rather a bully I am afraid I said I did
order her about rather roughly

Mr Atwood burst into a laugh That Ezry Jones woman was the skippers
wife he declared Makes a lot of diffrence that does I was
considerable of a bully myself afore Betsy got me on the parsons books
Now Im the most peaceable critter ever you see Your turns comin
Miss Colton All you got to do is be patient

Joshua said Mrs Atwood in mild reproof You mustnt mind his talk
Miss Colton Hes a terrible joker

Miss Colton changed the subject She did not so much as look at me again
during the meal and after it was over she went to her room explaining
that she was very tired and would try to get a little sleep

I had discovered that the lighthouse being close to the mainland was
equipped with a telephone Now I begged permission to use it I called
up Denboro and asked to be connected with the Colton home I felt very
sure that there would be no sleep in the big house that night and I
wished to relieve their anxiety and to send word to Mother Mr Colton
himself answered my call

I announced my identity and explained where I was and that his daughter
was in my care and perfectly safe

Thank God was the fervent exclamation at the other end of the wire
and the voice which uttered it was shaking with emotion Stay where you
are a moment Paine Let me tell my wife She is almost crazy Hold the
wire

I held the wire and waited The next voice which reached my ears was
Mrs Coltons She asked a dozen questions one after the other Was
Mabel safe Was I sure she was safe Wasnt the poor child almost dead
after all shed been through What had happened What was she doing away
over there in that dreadful place Why had I taken her there

I answered as well as I could telling briefly of the collision in
the fog and what followed The explanation appeared to be rather
unsatisfactory

You take the wire James I heard the lady say I cant make it all
out Mabel is at some horrid lighthouse and there is no kerosene or
something The poor child Alone there with that man Tell him she must
be brought home at once It is dreadful for her Think what she must
have suffered And with HIM What will people say Tell him to bring her
home The idea I dont believe a word

Hellohello Paine Colton was at the phone once more Can you get
MabelMiss Colton over to Wellmouth do you think

Yes I will get a boat as soon as I can Miss Colton is in her room
asleep I hope She is very tired and I think she should rest until
daylight I will get her to Wellmouth in time for the morning train

Never mind the train Ill come after her in the auto I will start
now I will meet you at the landingat the wharf if there is one

Very well Will you be good enough to send word to my mother that I am
safe and sound She will be worried

Yes yes Ill send word Tell Mabel to be careful and not take cold
   Yes Henrietta I am attending to everything Goodby Paine

That was all not a word of thanks I did not expect thanks and I made
allowances for the state of mind at the mansion but that telephone
conversation particularly Mrs Coltons share in it cast a gloom over
my spirits I did not care to hear more of Mr Atwoods yarns and jokes
I went to my own room but I did not sleep

At halfpast five I was astir again The lightkeeper it appeared had
an auxiliary engine in a catboat which he owned and could let me have a
sufficient supply of gasolene to fill the Comforts tank When this was
doneand it took a long time for Joshua insisted upon helping and
he was provokingly slowI returned to the sitting room and asked Mrs
Atwood to call Miss Colton

Land sakes was the cheery answer I didnt have to call her Shes
been up for fifteen minutes Said she was goin to take a cruise around
the lighthouse I callate youll find her out there somewheres Go
and fetch her here You two must have a bitea cup of hot coffee and a
biled egg anyhowafore you leave Yes you must I shant listen to a
no from either of you

I went out and crossed the sandy yard to the whitewashed lighthouse
There was no sign of Miss Colton in the yard but the door of the
lighthouse was open and I entered No one there The stairs winding
upward invited me to climb and I did so The little room with the big
lantern the latter now covered with a white cloth was untenanted
also I looked out of the window There she was on the iron gallery
surrounding the top of the tower leaning on the rail and gazing out
over the water She had not heard me For a moment I stood there
watching her

She was not wearing Mrs Atwoods gown now but her own wrinkled and
stained from its last nights drenching in salt water but dry now She
was bareheaded and her brown hair was tossing in the sea breeze The
sun but a little way above the horizon and shining through the morning
haze edged her delicate profile with a line of red gold I had never
seen her look more beautiful or more aristocratic and unapproachable
The memory of our night in the launch seemed more like an unbelievable
dream than ever and the awakening more cruel For I was awake now What
I had heard over the phone had awakened me thoroughly There should be
no more dreaming

I stepped out upon the gallery

Good morning I said

She turned quickly and I heard her catch her breath with a little gasp

I beg pardon said I Im afraid I startled you

She was startled that was evident and it seemed to me a trifle
embarrassed But the embarrassment was but momentary

Good morning she said How very silent you can be when you choose
Mr Paine How long have you been standing there pray

Only a moment I came to call you to breakfast

To breakfast

Yes Mrs Atwood insists upon our breakfasting before I take you
ashore

Oh Why didnt you call me I would have come down

I did not see you until I reached the lantern room My silence was not
premeditated I made noise enough or so it seemed to me but you were
so wrapped in your thoughts

Nonsense She interrupted me almost sharply I was not wrapped in
anything except the beauty of this view It IS beautiful isnt it

Very I answered but fear I was not looking at the view It may be
that she noticed this for she said

You have come into your own again I see So have I

She indicated her gown with a smile and a gesture I laughed

Yes I said I have returned unto Joshua that which was his

You should have kept it You have no idea what a picturesque
lightkeeper you make Mr Paine

Somehow or other this harmless joke hurt

Yes I answered drily that is about my measure I presume

Her eyes twinkled I thought the measure rather scant she
observed mischievously I wish I might have a snapshot of you in
thatuniform

I am afraid the opportunity for that is past

But it with a little bubble of mirth it was so funny

No doubt I am sorry I cant oblige you with a photograph

She looked at me biting her lip

Is your bump of humor a dent Mr Paine she inquired I am afraid it
must be

You may be right I dont appreciate a joke as keenly aswell as Mr
Carver for instance

She turned her back upon me and led the way to the door

Shall we go to breakfast she asked in a different tone

Breakfast was a silent meal so far as we two were concerned The
Atwoods however talked enough to make up the deficiency

As we rose from the table the young lady turned to the lightkeeper

Mr Atwood she said I presume you are going to be kind enough to
take me to Wellmouth

Why Miss II want callatin to Mr Paine here hes got all the
gas he needs now and hell take you over in his launch

Oh But you will go if I ask you to

Sartin sure

You have been so very kind that I dislike to ask another favor but
I hoped you would send a telegram for me My father and mother will be
very much alarmed and I must wire them at once You will have to send it
collect for with a rueful smile I havent my purse with me

Land sakes thatll be all right Glad to help you out

I put in a word It will not be necessary I said impatiently I
have money enough Miss Colton

I was ignored

Thank you so much Mr Atwood You will come with me and look out for
the telegram

Yes Yesyes But I dont see what you need to send no telegram for
Mr Paine here he telephoned to your folks last night

She looked at me and then at Joshua

Last night she repeated

Why yesor this mornin after youd gone to bed He was dead set on
it I could see he was most tired and wore out but he wouldnt rest
till hed phoned your folks and told em you was safe and sound Didnt
seem to care nothin about himself but he was bound your pa and ma
shouldnt worry

She turned to me

Did you she asked

Yes I answered Your father is to meet us at the Wellmouth wharf

Why didnt you tell me

I intended to I meant to tell you when I saw you in the lighthouse
butI forgot it

She said no more but when Joshua hat and boots on met us at the door
she spoke to him

You need not go Mr Atwood she said It will not be
necessarynow

Godfreys Id just as soon as not Ruther if anything

He hurried down to the beach I was about to follow when a hand touched
my arm I turned to find a pair of brown eyes misty but wonderful
looking into mine

Thank you said Miss Colton

Dont mention it

But I shall It was thoughtful and kind I had forgotten orat
leastI took it for granted there was no phone here But you did not
forget It was thoughtful butit was like you

I was breathing hard I could not look at her

Dont I said roughly It was nothing Anyone with common sense
would have thought of it and done it of course

I did not But youOh it was like you Always some one else and
never yourself You were worn out You must have been after with a
shudderlast night Oh I have so much to thank you for I

Come on Heave ahead It was Mr Atwood bellowing from the beach
All aboard for Wellmouth and pints alongshore

Betsy appeared in the door behind us

All ready be you she asked

I could not have answered but my companion was once more as calm and
cool as the morning itself

All ready she answered Goodby Mrs Atwood And thank you over and
over again You have been so kind With a sudden flash of enthusiasm
Every one is kind It is a beautiful world Goodby

She ran lightly down the slope and I followed

The trip to Wellmouth was of but a half hours duration Atwood talked
all the time Miss Colton laughed at his stories and seemed to be
without a care She scarcely looked at me during the passage and if
she caught me looking at her and our glances met she turned away On the
wharf was a big automobile surrounded by a gaping crowd of small boys
and longshore loafers

We drew up beside the landing Our feminine passenger sprang ashore and
ran up the steps to be seized in her fathers arms Mrs Colton was
there also babbling hysterically I watched and listened for a moment
Then I started the engine

Shove off I ordered The lightkeeper was astonished

Aint ye goin ashore he demanded

No I answered curtly Im going home Shove off

The launch was fifty feet from the pier when I heard a shout Colton
was standing on the wharf edge waving his hand Beside him stood his
daughter her mothers arms about her

Here Paine shouted Colton Come back Come back and go home with us
in the car There is plenty of room

I did not answer

Come back Come back Paine he shouted again Mrs Colton raised her
head from her daughters shoulder

James James she cautioned without taking the trouble to lower
her voice dont make a scene Let him go in his dreadful boat if he
prefers to

Paine cried her husband again

I must look out for the launch I shouted I shall be home almost as
soon as you are Goodby

I left the lightkeeper at his island He refused to accept a cent
from me except in payment for the gasolene and declared he had had a
fustrate night of it

Come and see us again Mr Paine he said Come any time and fetch
your lady along Shes a good one she is and nicelookin dont talk
Youre a lucky critter did you know it Haw haw Goodby

The Comfort never made better time than on that homeward trip I
anchored her at her moorings went ashore in the skiff and hastened up
to the house It was past ten oclock and I would be over an hour
late at the bank A fine beginning for my first day in charge of the
institution

The diningroom door was open but no one was in the diningroom The
kitchen door however was shut and from behind it I heard Dorindas
voice

You can get right out of this house she said I dont care if youve
got a mortgage on the rest of the Cape You aint got one on this house
and you nor nobody else shall stay in it and talk that way Theres the
door

Dorindy wailed another voiceLutes You mustnt talk soto him
Dont you realize

I realize that if I had a husband instead of a jellyfish I shouldnt
have to talk Be still you

A third voice made itself heard

All right it growled I aint anxious to stay here any longer than
is necessary Bein an honest decent man Im ashamed to be seen here
as it is But you can tell that lowlived sneak Ros Paine that

I opened the door

You may tell him yourself Captain Dean said I What is it



CHAPTER XX


My unexpected entrance caused a sensation Lute sitting on the edge of
one of the kitchen chairs an agonized expression on his face started
so violently that he almost lost his balance Dorinda standing with her
back toward me turned quickly Captain Jedediah Dean his hand on the
knob of the door opening to the back yard showed the least evidence of
surprise He did not start nor did he speak but looked at me with a
countenance as grim and set and immovable as if it had been cast in a
mould

Lute characteristically enough uttered the first word

By time he gasped Its Ros himself RosRos you know what he
says He pointed a shaking finger at the captain He says you

Keep still Dorinda struck her palms together with a slap as if her
husband had been what she often called him a parrot Then without
another glance in his direction she stepped backward and took her stand
beside me

Im real glad to see you home safe and sound Roscoe she said
calmly

Thank you Dorinda Now Captain Dean I believe you were sending a
message to me just now I am here and you can deliver it What is it you
have to say

Before he could answer Dorinda spoke once more

Lute she said you come along with me into the dininroom

Butbut Dorindy I

You come with me This aint any of my business any more and it never
was any of yours Come move

Lute moved but so slowly that his progress to the door took almost a
full minute His wife paid no heed to the pleading looks he gave her
and stood majestically waiting until he passed her and crossed the sill
Then she turned to me

If you want me just speak she said I shall be in the diningroom
There aint no need for Comfort to know about this She doesnt know
that youve been away and hasnt been worried at all Ill look out for
her Lutell be with me so you neednt fret about him either

She closed the door

Now Captain Dean I repeated what is it you have to say

The captains grim mouth twisted in a savage sneer

You know what Im goin to say as well as I do he answered

Possibly but you had better say it

It wont take me long Youve sold that Shore Lane land to Jim Colton
aint you

Yes

My calm affirmative seemed to astonish him I think he expected a
denial His hand left the doorknob and he stepped toward me

YouHAVE he cried You dont even take the trouble toYou have the
face to stand there and tell me

He almost choked

Captain Dean I interrupted quickly wait a moment Listen to me I
have sold Colton the land I did not intend selling it at all least of
all to him but circumstances compelled me to change my mind I did it
because I was obliged to It is done I am sorry I had to do it but
under the same conditions I should do it again I am not ashamed

He leaned forward steadying himself with a hand upon the table and
stared at me

You aint ashamed he repeated You aint ashamed Why youDidnt
you tell me youd never sell that land Didnt you promise me

I did not promise anything At first I promised not to sell without
letting you know of my intention Afterward I took back that promise

But why did you sell You said it want a question of price at all You
made your brags that it want To me over and over you made em And
then you sneak off and

Stop I did think it was not a question of price Then I found out that
it was

He clenched his fist

Damn you he shouted furiously You liar You sneak After I

That is enough Captain This has gone far enough I have sold the
landfor what seemed to me a good reasonand your calling me names
will not change the situation I dont care to hear them You had better
go

WHAT

I say you had better go

_I_ go Youll put me out

No certainly not But there is nothing to be gained by a quarrel and
so for both our sakes I think you had better go away

For a moment I thought he would strike me Then his fist fell heavily
upon the table His lips were quivering like those of an infirm person
He looked old and I had never before considered him an old man

What made you do it he cried desperately What made you do it Is
it all settled Cant you back out

No

Butbut why didnt you sell to meto the town If you had to sell why
didnt you do that Why did you go to him

Because he would pay me what I needed because his price was higher
than any you or the town could offer

How did you know that My heavens above Id have paidId have paid
most anythingout of my own pocket I would I tell you this meant
everything to me Im gettin along in years I aint been any too well
liked here in Denboro and I knew it You think that didnt make no
difference to me maybe I pretended it didnt but it did by the
Almighty it did I intended for folks to be thankful to me forIOh
WHY did you do it Ros

I shook my head I was sorry for him nowsorry and astonished He
had given me a glimpse of the real Jedediah Dean not the pompous
loudvoiced town politician and boss but the man desirous of fighting
his way into the esteem and liking of his neighbors

Im sorry Captain I said If I had knownif I had had time to
think perhaps I might have acted differently But I had no time I
found that I must have the money which that land would bring and that I
had to have it immediately So I went where I knew I could get it

Money You needed money Why didnt you come to me Id have lent it to
you

You

Yes me What do you callate Ive been backin you all this summer
for What did I get you that job in my bank for

YOU George Taylor engaged me for that place

Maybe so But do you suppose he did it on his own hook HE couldnt
hire you unless the directors said so and the directors dont say
anything the majority of em unless I say it first _I_ put the notion
in Georges head He didnt know it but I did And I put it in the
directors heads too Ros Paine I always liked you though I did use
to think you was a gentleman loafer There was a somethin about you
even then a kind of handsoff mind your own business independence
about you that I liked though I knew mighty well you never liked me
And after you and me got together on this Lane thing I liked you more
and more You could tell me to go to the devil as well as you could
anybody else and Ill shake hands with a feller thatll do that I
always wanted a boy of my own Nellies a good girl no better afloat or
ashore but she is a girl George is a good feller too but somehow
or nother Id come to think of you as the kind of son Id have had if
the Almighty had give me one Oh what did you do this for

I could not answer He had overwhelmed me I never felt meaner or more
wicked I had been ready to face him ready for the interview with him
which I knew was inevitable and which I had foreseen but not this kind
of an interview

He took his hand from the table and stood erect

Money he said You wanted money You must have wanted it bad What
did you want it for

I cant tell you

You had better Its your only chance I tell you that

I cant help it Captain Dean I cant tell you I wish I could

He regarded me in silence for a moment Then All right he said
solemnly Im through with you Ros Paine In one way Im through with
you In another I aint I callate you was figgerin to go straight up
to the bank as bold as brass and set down at George Taylors desk and
draw your wages like an honest man Dont you ever dare set foot in that
bank again Youre fired bounced kicked out Do you understand

Very well I understand

You will understand whether you do now or not Coltons got the Shore
Lane and youve got his dirty money in your pocket Hes paid you but
the town aint The town you sold out aint paid youbut Im goin to
see that it does Ros Paine Im goin to drive you out of Denboro

He turned on his heel strode to the door went out and slammed it
behind him

I went back to the diningroom Lute was nowhere in sight but Dorinda
was standing by the mantel dusting as usual where there was no
dust I did not speak but walked toward the door leading to the stairs
Dorinda stepped in front of me

Roscoe she said sharply can he do it

Do it I repeated What do you mean

Can he give you your walkin papers at that bank Oh I heard him I
tried not to but he hollered so I couldnt help it That kitchen door
aint much thickern a sheet of paper anyhow Can he do it

I guess so He seems to be boss of that institution

But cant Lisha Warren or some of the other directors help you Jed
Dean dont boss Lisha Warrennot much

I shant ask for help Please dont trouble me Dorinda

I tried to pass her but she would not permit it

I shant trouble you Ros she said I guess youve got troubles
enough without me But you let me ask you this Are you goin to let him
drive you out of town

I shrugged my shoulders It may not take much driving I announced
listlessly if it were not for Mother I should be only too glad to go

Again I tried to pass but this time she seized my arm

Roscoe Paine she cried dont you talk like that I dont want to
hear another word like that Dont you let Jed Dean or nobody else drive
you out of Denboro You aint done nothin to be ashamed of have you

I sold that land to Mr Colton I dont know how Captain Jed found it
out but it is true enough I did exactly what he said I did

Found out He found out from somebody over to Ostable where the deed
was recorded that is how he found out He said so But I dont care for
that And I dont care if you sold the Lane ten times over You didnt
do it for any mean or selfish reason that I know There aint a selfish
bone in your body Roscoe Ive lived along with you all these years and
I know Nobody that was mean or selfish would give up their chances in
life and stay here in this onehoss town because his ma was sick and had
took a notion that she couldnt bear to part with him Dont you mind
Jed Deanpigheaded old thingor anybody else in Denboro Hold up
your head and show em you dont care for the whole caboodle of em Let
em talk and act like fools if they want to It comes natural to most
of em I callate and theyll be sorry some day Dont you let em
drive you out They wont come inside THIS house with their talk not
while Im here I tell you that

Her eyes behind the brassrimmed spectacles flashed fire This was the
longest speech I had ever heard her make

There Dorinda I said smiling dont worry on my account Im not
worth it And whatever I do I shall see that you and Lute are provided
for

Instead of calming her this statement seemed to have the exactly
opposite effect

Stop it she snapped The idea Do you suppose its for myself Im
talkin this way to you I guess taint My soul Ill look out for
myself and Lute too longs Im able to walk and when I cant walk
twill be because Ive stopped breathin Its for you Im talkin for
you and Comfort Think of her

I sighed I have been thinking of her Dorinda I declared She
doesnt know a word about this

Then tell her

I cant tell her my reason for selling any more than I can tell
youor Dean

Tell her what you can then Tell her as much of the truth as you can
Shell say you done right of course Whatever you do is right to her

I made no reply She regarded me keenly

Roscoe she went on do you WANT to go somewheres else

I dont know Dorinda I might as well be here as anywhere perhaps I
am rather blue and discouraged just now thats all

I cant blame you much But bein discouraged dont do any good
Besides its always darkest just afore dawn they say anyhow Ive had
that preached to me ever since I was a girl and Ive tried to believe
it through a good many cloudy spells Roscoe dont you let old Jed or
anybody DRIVE you out of Denboro but if you WANT to goif you think
youd ought to go to earn money or anything dont you worry about
leavin Comfort Ill look out for her as well as if she was my own
Remember that

I laid my hand on hers Thank you I said earnestly Dorinda you
are a good woman

To my surprise the eyes behind the spectacles became misty Tears
in Dorindas eyes When she spoke it was in for her a curiously
hesitating tone

Roscoe she faltered I wonder if youd be cross if I asked about
what want any of my business Im old enough to be your grandma pretty
nigh so Im goin to risk it You used to be independent enough You
never used to care for the town or anybody in it Lately youve changed
Changed in a good many ways Is somethin besides this Lane affair
frettin you Is somebody frettin you Are you worried aboutthat
one

She had caught me unawares I felt the blood tingle in my cheeks I
tried to laugh and made a failure of the attempt

That one I repeated IWhy I dont understand Dorinda

Dont you Well if you dont then Im just talkin silly thats all
If you do I     Humph I might have known it

She turned like a shot and jerked the door open There was a rattle a
series of thumps and a crash Lute was sprawling upon the floor at
our feet I gazed at him in openmouthed astonishment Dorinda sniffed
scornfully

I might have known it she repeated Sittin on the stairs there
listenin want you

Lute raised himself to his knees

I think he panted II swan I shouldnt wonder if Id broke my
leg

Umhm Well if youd broke your neck twouldnt have been no moren
you deserve Shame on you Sneakin thing

Now Dorindy II want listenin I was just

Dont talk to me Dont you open your mouth And if you open it to
anybody else about what you heard IllI declare Ill shut you up
in the dark closet and keep you there as if you was three year old
Sometimes I think your head aint any older than that Go right out of
this house

But wherell I go

I dont care where you go Only dont let me set eyes on you till
dinner time March

Lute backed away as she advanced waving both his hands and pleading and
expostulating

Dorindy I tell you    WHAT makes you so unlikely    I was just
   All right then desperately Ill go And if you never set eyes
on me again twont be my fault Youll be sorry then If you never see
me no more youll be sorry

Ill set eyes on you at dinner time I aint afraid of that Git

She followed him to the kitchen and then returned

Ah hum she sighed its pretty hard to remember that about darkest
just afore dawn when you have a burden like that on your shoulders to
lug through life Its night most of the time then Poor critter he
means well enough too And once he was a likely enough young feller
though shiftless even then But he had a long spell of fever three year
after we was married and hes never been good for much since I try to
remember that and to be patient with him but its a pretty hard job
sometimes

She sighed again I had often wondered how a woman of her sense could
have married Luther Rogers Now she was telling me

I never really cared for him she went on looking toward the door
through which the discomfited eavesdropper had made his exit There was
somebody else I did care for but he and I quarreled and I took Luther
out of spite and because my folks wanted me to Ive paid for it since
Roscoe earnestly Roscoe if you care for anybody and she cares for
you dont let anything keep you apart If shes worth a million or
fifty cents that dont make any difference It shouldnt be a matter
of her folks or your folks or money or pride or anything else Its a
matter for just you and her And if you love each other thats enough
I tell you so and I know

I was more astonished than ever I could scarcely believe that this was
the dry practical Dorinda Rogers who had kept house for Mother and me
all these years And with my astonishment were other feelings feelings
which warned me that I had better make my escape before I was trapped
into betraying that which all the way home from Mackerel Island I
had been swearing no one should ever know I would not even admit it to
myself much less to anyone else

I did not look at Dorinda and my answer to her long speech was as
indifferent and careless as I could make it

Thank you Dorinda I said Ill remember your advice if I ever need
it which isnt likely Now I must go to my room and change my clothes
These are too badly wrinkled to be becoming

When I came down after an absence of half an hour she was sitting by
the window sewing

Comforts waitin to see you Roscoe she said Ive told her all
about it

YOUVE told herwhat I demanded in amazement

About your sellin the Lane and losin your job and so on Dont look
at me like that Twas the only commonsense thing to do Shed heard
old LeatherLungs whoopin out there in the kitchen and shed heard you
and me talkin here in the dininroom I hoped she was asleep but she
want After you went upstairs she called for me and wanted to know
the whole story I told her what I knew of it Now you can tell her the
rest She takes it just as I knew she would You done it and so its all
right

Roscoe is that you

It was Mother calling me I went into the darkened room and sat down
beside the bed

She and I had much to say to each other This time I kept back nothing
except my reason for selling the land I told her frankly that that
reason was a secret and that it must remain a secret even from her

I hate to say that to you Mother I told her You dont know how I
hate it I would tell you if I could

She pressed my hand I know you would Roscoe she said I am quite
content not to know That your reason for selling was an honorable one
that is all I ask

It was that Mother

I am sure of it But hesitatingly can you tell me this You did not
do it because you needed moneyfor me Our income is the same as ever
We have not met with losses

No Mother Our income is the same that it has been for years

Then it was not because of me because you felt that I should have
those luxuries you talk about so often Oh I dont need them Roscoe
I really dont I amI scarcely dare say it for fear it may not be
truebut I THINK I am better than I have been I feel stronger

I know you are better Mother Doctor Quimby is very much encouraged

Is he I am so glad For your sake Boy Perhaps the time will come
when I may not be your Old Man Of the Sea as I am now But you did not
sell the land because of me

No

You did not sell it for yourself that I know I wonder    But
there I mustnt wonder and I wont Captain Dean was very angry and
unreasonable Dorinda says I suppose his pride is hurt Im afraid he
will make it unpleasant for you in the village

He will do his best Im sure of that

You poor boy As if you did not have enough to bear without that He
has asked you to resign from the bank

I smiled He has pitched me out neck and crop I answered I
expected that of course

But what will you do Cant Mr Taylor help you Perhaps he will use
his influence with the captain

I dont need his influence Mother I took the place merely because of
a whim Now that I have lost it I am no worse off than I was before

But you enjoyed the work

Yes

I was only beginning to realize how much I had enjoyed it I sighed
involuntarily

Mother heard the sigh and the pressure of her hand on mine tightened

Poor boy she said again Then after a moment I wish I might talk
with Miss Colton about this

I started violently What had put that idea in her head

Miss Colton I exclaimed Mother whatever you do dont speak to
herabout me

Why not She has not called on us for some time but she is interested
in you I know And perhaps her father could

Mother dont

She was silent for an instant Then she said quietly Boy what is it
Is there something else you havent told me Something abouther

No no I stammered

Isnt there Are you sure

I do not know what reply I should have made Her question coming so
close upon the heels of Dorindas hints upset me completely Was it
written upon my face for everyone to see Did I look the incredible
idiot that I knew myself to be For I did know it In spite of my
determination not to admit it even in my innermost thoughts I knew I
was in love with Mabel Coltonmadly insanely hopelessly in love with
her and should be until my dying day I had played with fire too long

Before I could answer there came a knock at the door It opened and
Dorindas head appeared She seemed for her excited

Theres somebody to see you Ros she said Youd better come out
soons you can Hes in a hurry

Someone to see me I repeated Who is it

Dorinda glanced at Mother and then at me She did not so much as
whisper but her lips formed a name I rose from my chair

Mother looked at me and then at Dorinda

Who is it Roscoe she asked

Just a caller on a business matter I answered hurriedly Ill be
out at once Dorinda

But who is it Roscoe

Its Mr Colton Mother He has probably come to

Dorinda Mother interrupted me ask Mr Colton to come in here

But Mother

Ask him to come in here Dorinda I should like to meet him

Dorinda hesitated but when Mother spoke in that tone none of us
hesitated long She disappeared A moment later the door opened wide
and Colton entered The sudden transition from sunlight to semidarkness
bewildered him for a moment doubtless for he stood there without
speaking Dorinda who had ushered him in went out and closed the door
I stepped forward

Good morning Mr Colton I said as calmly as I could You have
never met my mother I think Mother this is Mr Colton our neighbor

Colton turned toward the bed and murmured a few words For once I
think he was startled out of his customary cool selfpossession And
when Mother spoke it seemed to me that she too was disturbed

Roscoe she said quickly will you draw that windowshade a little
more The light is rather strong Thank you Mr Colton I am very glad
to meet you I have heard of you often of course and I have met your
daughter She has been very kind to me in many ways Wont you sit
down

I drew forward a chair Our visitor accepted it

Thank you Mrs Paine he said I will sit To be honest Im very
glad of the opportunity I have been under the doctors care for the
past few weeks and last nights performance is not the best sort of
treatment for a tender digestion The doctor told me what I needed was
rest and sleep and freedom from care I told him I probably shouldnt
get the last item till I was dead As for the restand sleepHumph
with a short laugh I wonder what he would have said if he had seen me
last night

Mothers face was turned away from him on the pillow I am sorry to
hear that you have been ill Mr Colton she said

Ill Im not ill I have never been sick in my life and I dont propose
to begin now If the crowd in New York would let me alone I should be
all right enough There is a deal on there that is likely to come to
a head pretty soon and my people at the office are nervous They keep
phoning and telegraphing and upsetting things generally Ill have to
run over there myself in a day or two and straighten it out But there
I didnt come here to worry you with my troubles I feel as if I knew
you Mrs Paine

Knew me Knew ME Mr Colton

Yes I have never had the pleasure of meeting you before but my
daughter has spoken of you often She is a great admirer of yours I
wont tell you all the nice things she has said about you for she has
probably said them to you or to your son already

You should be very proud of your daughter Mr Colton She is a
charming girl

Thanks Just among us three Ill admit in confidence that I think
youre right And Ill admit too that you have a pretty good sort of
a son Mrs Paine He is inclined to be with a glance in my direction
a little too stubborn and highprincipled for this practical world
but with a chuckle he can be made to listen to reason if you give
him time enough That is so isnt it Paine

I did not answer Mother spoke for me

I am not sure that I understand you Mr Colton she said quietly
I presume you are referring to the sale of the land I do not know why
Roscoe changed his mind in that matter but I do know that his reason
was a good one and an honest one

He hasnt told it to you then

No But I know that he thought it right or he never would have sold

I broke in here I did not care to hear my own praises

Did you call to discuss the Shore Lane Mr Colton I inquired I
thought that affair settled

It is No I didnt come to discuss that Mrs Paine I dont know why
your son sold me that land but Im inclined to think like you that he
wouldnt have done it unless he thought it was right I know mighty
well he wasnt afraid of me Oh you neednt laugh young man There
ARE people in that fix plenty of em No I didnt come to talk Lane
That bird is dead I came first of all to thank you for what you did
for my daughter last night

Mother turned her head and looked at him

For your daughter Last night Roscoe what does he mean

Nothing Mother nothing I said hastily I was unlucky enough to
run the Comfort into Miss Coltons canoe in the bay yesterday afternoon
in the fog Fortunately I got her into the launch andand

And saved her from drowning then and a dozen times afterward He
hasnt told you Mrs Paine No I can see that he hasnt All right I
will Paine if your ingrowing modesty wont stand the pressure you had
better leave the room This is about what happened Mrs Paine as Mabel
tells it

I tried to prevent him but it was no use He ignored me altogether and
went on to tell of the collision in the fog the voyage across the
bay and my telephone from the lighthouse The story as he told it
magnified what he called my coolness and commonsense to a ridiculous
extent I lost patience as I listened

Mr Colton I interrupted this is silly Mother the whole affair
was more my fault than my good judgment If I had anchored when it first
happened we should have been home in an hour instead of drifting all
night

Why didnt you anchor then asked Colton

Because II

I stopped short I could not tell him why I did not anchor He laughed
aloud

Thats all right he said I guess Mabels story is near enough to
the truth for all practical purposes Mrs Paine with a sudden change
to seriousness you can understand why I have come here this morning
If it had not been for your sons pluck and cool head and good
judgment IMrs Colton and I might have beenGod knows in what state
we might have been today God knows I cant think of it

His voice trembled Mother put out a hand and took mine

Roscoe she said Roscoe

So I came to thank him went on our visitor This isnt the first
time he has done something of the sort It seems almost as if heBut
never mind that Im not going to be foolish Your son and I Mrs
Paine have been fighting each other most of the summer Thats all
right It was a square fight and until this newest freak of hisand he
has got me guessing as to what it meansI admit I thought he was quite
as likely to lick me as I was to lick him Ive watched him pretty
closely and I am a pretty fair judge of a man I flatter myself Did he
tell you that a while ago I offered him a place in my office

In your office You offered him that No he did not tell me Roscoe
reproachfully

I did not tell you Mother because it was not worth while Of course I
could not accept the offer

She hesitated and before she spoke Colton broke in

Why not That was what you were going to say Mrs Paine I take it
That is what _I_ saidwhy not And I say it again Paine that offer is
still open

I shook my head I told you then that I could not accept I said It
is impossible

Why is it impossible So far as I am concerned I believe you would be a
mighty good investment

Impossible I said again

Nothing is impossible We wont waste words I am going to be plain and
I think Mrs Paine will excuse me You think you should not leave your
mother perhaps I understand that reason It would be a good one
except thatwell that it isnt good any longer Your mother is much
better than she was Quimbyher doctor and minesays so I shall see
that she is well looked after If she needs a nurse she shall have
one the best we can get Oh be still and let me finish You can talk
afterward Youre not going so far away New York isnt the end of the
earth it is only the center or it thinks it is Youll be in close
touch with Denboro all the time and you can come here whenever you want
to Now will you take my offer

No

Young man if I didnt know there were brains inside that head of yours
I should think it was as the boys say solid ivory Confound you Here
Mrs Paine turning to Mother you take him in hand Tell him he must
come with me

Mother I protested He cut my protest short

Tell him he ordered

Mother looked at me I think perhaps you should accept Roscoe she
said slowly

Accept Mother

Yes II think you should I am sure everyone else would think so I
should not wish you to do so if Mr Colton was merely trying to be kind
to help you from motives of gratitude or charity

Dont use that word please snapped Big Jim When I lose my mind I
may take to charity but not before Charity Good Lord

But it is not charity I am better Roscoe I realize it every day
and with Dorinda I shall get on perfectly well I have been thinking of
something like this for a long time You owe it to yourself Roscoe The
chance is one that many men would be very very glad to have come their
way I shall not urge you Boy You must decide for yourself and I know
you will but Roscoe I shall be quite contentedyes glad and proud
if you say yes to Mr Colton

The gentleman named nodded emphatic approval Thats the talk he
exclaimed Mrs Paine I congratulate you on your commonsense

I think like you that you will have made a good investment Mr
Colton was Mothers answer

I rose to my feet This must be ended now for all time

I thank you Mr Colton I said though not as steadily as I could
have wished I am greatly obliged to you and I realize that you offer
me an exceptional opportunity or what would be one for another man But
I cannot accept

Look here Paine Ill speak plainer still I understand that that
Shore Lane trade of ours has become common property or at any rate it
will be common property soon If I see the situation clearly Denboro is
likely to be a rather unpleasant place for you That fellow Dean has a
lot of influence hereheaven knows whyand he hates me worse than Old
Nick hates holy water Oh I know youre not afraid of him But what
is the use of taking the rough road when the smooth one is right before
your feet Say yes and lets end it

No said I stubbornly No Mr Colton

You mean it Very well I leave you in your Mothers hands She will
probably bring you to your senses before long Mrs Paine you can
handle him I have no doubt I am glad to have met you and with your
permission I shall call on you again So will Mabel As for you young
man I thank you for last nights work You will perhaps accept thanks
if you refuse everything else Good morning

He rose bowed and walked to the door As he opened it he staggered
perceptibly I thought for an instant that he was going to fall and I
sprang to his assistance

Its all right he said gruffly This digestion of mine sets my head
spinning sometimes That doctor says I shall upset completely unless I
rest I told him he was a fool and I intend to prove it Let me be I
can walk I should hope When I cant Ill call the ambulanceor the
hearse Ill find the way out myself Goodby

The door closed behind him

Roscoe said Mother quickly come here

I turned toward her She was looking at me with a strange expression

What is it Mother I asked anxiously

Roscoe she whispered I know him I have met him before

Know him You have met Mr Coltonbefore Where

At our home in the old days He came there once withwith your father
He was our guest at dinner

I could scarcely believe it Then as the thought of what this might
mean flashed to my mind I asked anxiously

Did he know you do you think

No I am sure he did not We met but once and I have with a little
sigh changed since then But I recognized him The name of Colton was
familiar to me when you first mentioned it some time ago but I did
not remember where I had heard it Of course I did not connect this Mr
Colton withthat one

I frowned This complicated matters still more and further
complications were superfluous

And knowing this knowing that he might recognize you at any time you
urged me to accept his offer I said reproachfully Mother

Yes

Mother how can you Would you have me go to New York and enter a
banking house where any hour of any day I might be recognized by some
of the men I once knew Where I might expect at any moment to be called
by my real name How can you

She gazed at me earnestly Why not tell him Roscoe she asked

I stared at her aghast Tell him I repeated Tell him who I am
Tell him our story the story thatMother are you crazy

No I believe I am sane at least I have been thinking a great deal of
late As I have been growing stronger I have been thinking more and more
and I am not sure that you and I have been right in hiding here as
we have done It was all my fault I know but I was weak andand I
dreaded all the gossip and scandal But Boy it was a mistake After
all we have done no wrong you and Iwe personally have nothing to
be ashamed of Why not end all this Go to Mr Colton tell him who you
are tell him our story then if he still wants you

I interrupted No Mother I said no no It is impossible Even if
he knew and it made no difference I could not do it I may go away I
may feel that I must go if you are well enough for me to leave you but
I can not go with him I ought not to see him again I must not see HER
    Oh dont you understand Mother II

She understood I had seized her hand and now she stroked it gently with
her own

So it is true she said quietly You love her Roscoe

Yes yes yes I answered desperately Oh dont speak of it
Mother I am insane I think

Does she care for you Boy Have you spoken to her

MOTHER Is it likely

But I think she does care Roscoe I think she does She must

This was so characteristic that although I was in anything but a
laughing mood I could not help smiling

How could she help it I presume you mean I observed sarcastically
There Mother dont worry I did not intend that you or anyone else
should know what an idiot I am but dont worryI shant do anything
ridiculous or desperate I may go somewhere to get away from Denboro
and to earn a living for you and me but that is all We wont speak of
her again

But if she does care Boy

If she doesOf course she doesntbut if she does cant you see
that only makes it worse Think who she is and who and what I am Her
familyHumph you have not met her mother I have

But if she loves you

Do you think I should permit her to ruin her lifefor me

Poor boy I am SO sorry

It is all right Mother There we wont be foolish any longer I am
going for a walk and I want you to rest I am glad we have had this
talk it has done me good to speak what I have been thinking Goodby I
will be back soon

She would have detained me but I broke away and went out My walk was a
long one I tramped the beach for eight long miles and though one
might think that my adventures of the night before had provided exercise
enough this additional effort seemed to do no harm I forgot dinner
entirely and supper was on the table when I returned to the house

I found Dorinda in a condition divided between anxiety and impatience

Have you seen anything of that man of mine she demanded I aint
seen hide nor hair of him since I pitched him out of this room this
mornin

I was surprised and a little disturbed I remembered Lutes threat about
never seein me no more

You dont suppose he has run away or anything like that do you I
asked

He wouldnt run far runnins too much like work But why he want home
for dinner I dont understand I never knew him to miss a meals vittles
afore I hope nothin aint happened to him thats all Well well
have our supper anyhow After that well see

But we did not have to see We were at the table when we heard the sound
of hurrying footsteps on the walk The gate closed with a bang Dorinda
rose from her chair

I swan I believe thats him now she exclaimed

If it is he is certainly running this time I observed What

The door was thrown open and the missing member of the household
appeared He was redfaced and panting but there was a curious air of
dignified importance in his bearing Dorindas lips shut tightly

Well Lute said I where have you been

Lute struggled for breath

Dont ask me where Ive been he gasped Dont waste no time askin
ME questions Get your hat on Ros Get your hat on this minute Where
did I put that Where in time did I put it

He was fumbling in his pockets Dorinda and I looked at each other She
shook her head

Hes gone stark foolish at last she said with decision Well
Ive been expectin it Lute Rogers stop pawin yourself over and act
sensible if you can What is the matter with you

Matter with me Nothins the matter with ME but theres somethin the
matter with other folks I tell you that Doctor Quimbys been there
twice already and the telephones been goin andandMy time you
ought to seen her face Twas just as white asasWHERE did I put that
letter

His pawing became more frantic than ever His wife stepped forward and
seized him by the arm

Stop it I tell you she commanded Stop it Whos sick Whose
telephones ringin What letter are you talkin about Answer me Stop
that Saint Vitus dancin and answer me this minute

She gave him a shake and his cap fell to the floor From it fell an
envelope Lute pulled himself free and pounced upon it

There tis he exclaimed By time I was scart Id lost it Read it
Ros read it

He handed me the envelope It bore my name I tore it opentook out the
sheet of notepaper which it inclosed and read as follows


Dear Mr Paine

Father is very ill and I am in great trouble I think you perhaps
can help us both Will you come over at once PLEASE do

Hastily yours

MABEL COLTON


Andand panted Lute she told me to tell you to please hurry And
youd ought to seen her face She

I heard no more I did not wait to get my hat as the excited bearer
of the note had urged me to do Bareheaded I hurried out of the
diningroom and along the path toward the Colton mansion



CHAPTER XXI


It was early in the evening but the big house was lighted as if for a
reception lights in the rooms above lights in the library and hall
and drawingroom Doctor Quimbys horse and buggy stood by one of
the hitching posts and the Colton motor car was drawn up by the main
entrance From the open windows of the servants quarters came the
sounds of excited voices I hastened to the front door Before I could
push the button of the electric bell the door was opened Johnson the
butler peered out at me Most of his dignity was gone

Is it you Mr Paine he asked anxiously Come in sir please Miss
Mabel has been asking for you not a minute ago sir

I entered the hall What is it Johnson I asked quickly How is Mr
Colton

The butler looked behind him before replying He shook his head
dubiously

Hes awful ill sir he whispered The doctors been with him for an
hour es unconscious and Mrs Colton is takin on something terrible
Its awful sir aint it

His nervousness was sufficient indication of the general demoralization
of the household And from one of the rooms above came the sobs of a
hysterical woman

Brace up man I whispered in reply This is no time for you to go to
pieces Where is Miss Colton

Shes with her father sir Step into the library and Ill call her

He was not obliged to call her for at that moment I heard her voice
speaking from the head of the stairs

Who is it Johnson she asked in a low tone

Its Mr Paine Miss Mabel

I heard a little exclamation of relief it seemed to me Then she
appeared descending the staircase Her face was as Lute had said
pale but her manner was calm much calmer than the butlers

She came to me and extended her hand Thank you for coming she said
I was sure you would

How is your father Miss Colton I asked

He is no worse Come into the library please Johnson if Mother or
the doctor need me I shall be in the library Come Mr Paine

We entered the library together The room in which I had had my two
memorable encounters with Big Jim Colton was without its dominant
figure now His big armchair was drawn up beside the table and the
papers and writing materials were in the place where I had seen them A
halfburned cigar lay in the ash tray But the strong fingers which
had placed it there were weak enough now and the masterful general of
finance was in his room upstairs fighting the hardest battle of his
life fighting for that life itself A door at the end of the library a
door which I had not noticed before was partially open and from within
sounded at intervals a series of sharp clicks the click of a telegraph
instrument I remembered that Colton had told me in one of his
conversations that he had both a private telephone and telegraph in his
house

Miss Colton closed the door behind us and turned to me

Thank you for coming she said again I need help and I could think
of no one but you You have hurried dreadfully havent you

She was looking at my forehead I caught a glimpse of my face in the
mirror above the mantel and reached for my handkerchief

I must have run every step of the way I answered I didnt realize
it But never mind that Tell me about your father

He was taken ill soon after he returned from your house He was in the
library here and I heard him call When I reached him he was lying upon
the couch scarcely able to speak He lost consciousness before we could
get him to his room The doctor says it is what he has feared an attack
of acute indigestion brought on by anxiety and lack of rest It was my
fault I am afraid Last nights worryPoor Father

For just a moment I feared she was going to break down She covered her
eyes with her hand But she removed it almost immediately

The doctor is confident there is no great danger she went on
Danger of course but not the greatest He is still unconscious
and will be for some time but if he is kept perfectly quiet and not
permitted to worry in the least he will soon be himself again

Thank God for that I exclaimed fervently And your motherMrs
Coltonhow is she

Her tone changed slightly I inferred that Mrs Coltons condition was
more trying than serious

Mother iswell in her nervous state any shock is disturbing She is
bearing the anxiety as well as we should expect

I judged that not much was expected

It was not on account of Fathers illness that I sent for you Mr
Paine she went on If he had not been ill I should not have needed
you of course But there is something else It could not have happened
at a more unfortunate time and I am afraid you may not be able to give
me the help I need Oh I hope you can I dont know what to do I know
it must be dreadfully important Father has been troubled about it for
days He has been saying that he must go to New York But the doctor had
warned us against his going and so we persuaded him to wait And now   
sit down please I want to ask your advice

I took the chair she indicated She drew another beside me and seated
herself

Mr Paine she began Then noticing my expression she asked What
is it

Nothing I answered nothing exceptIsnt that the telegraph
instrument I hear Isnt someone calling you

Yes yes it is Mr Davis Fathers confidential man his broker in
New York He is trying to get us I am sure He telephoned an hour ago
I got a part of his message and then the connection was broken off
Central says there is something the matter with the wire a big storm in
Connecticut somewhere It may take a whole day to repair it And it is
SO important It may meanI dont know WHAT it may mean Oh Mr Paine
DO you know anything about stocks

I looked at her blankly

Stocks I repeated

Yes yes a trifle impatiently Stocksthe stock marketrailroad
shareshow they are bought and solddo you know anything about them

I was more puzzled than ever but I answered as best I could

A very little I replied I used to know a good deal about them once
and of late since I have been in the Denboro bank my knowledge has
been brushed up a bit But I am afraid it is pretty fragmentary

Do you know anything about Louisville and Transcontinental

I started Louisville and Transcontinental was the one stock about which
I did know something Of late I had read everything the papers printed
concerning it It was the stock in which George Taylor had risked
so much and which had come so near to ruining him No wonder I was
startled Why did she mention that particular stock

What I stammered

Louisville and Transcontinental she repeated eagerly DO you know
anything about it Why do you look at me like that

I must be careful It was not possible that she could have learned
Georges secret No one knew that except George himself and his
brokers and I Yetyet why did she ask that question I must be on my
guard

I did not realize that I was looking at you in any extraordinary way
Miss Colton I answered

But you were Why Do you know anything about it If you dooh if you
do you may be able to help me to advise me And for Fathers sake I
want advice so much

For her fathers sake That did not sound as if her question concerned
George or me A trifle reassured I tried to remember something of what
I had read

I know of course I answered slowly what every one knows that the
California and Eastern has been or is reported to have been trying to
get control of the L and T Its possession would give the California
people the balance of power and mean the end of the present rate war
with the Consolidated Pacific The common stock has fluctuated between
30 and 50 for months and there have been all sorts of rumors So much
the newspapers have made common property That is all I know

You did not know then that Father and his associates control the
California and Eastern

I leaned back in my chair

No I said I did not know that Then your father

Father tells me a great deal concerning his business affairs I have
been very much interested in this It seems almost like a great war and
as if Father were a general He and his associates have gradually bought
up the C and E until they practically own it And they have been
working to get the Louisville road Last winter you remember there was
a great excitement and the stock went up and then down again That
was when it looked as if the other sidethe Consolidated Pacifichad
beaten Father but they had not You remember that

I remembered it That is to say George had told me of the rise and fall
of the stock It was then that he had bought

Yes I said I remember something of it

If Father had stayed in New York he would have won before this Oh
with a burst of pride they can NEVER beat him when he is leading the
fight himself He has through his brokers been sellingwhat do they
call it Oh yes selling the Louisville stock short ever since I am
not sure just what that means but perhaps you know

I think I do I answered thoughtfully He has been selling quietly
so as to force the stock down preparatory to buying in I remember
the papers have said that the C and E were reported as having lost
interest in the Louisville That was only a blind I presume

Yes Father never gives up you know that But he was very anxious that
the Consolidated Pacific people should think he had And nownow when
he is so illcomes this Mr Davis telephoned thatYes what is it

There had been a knock at the door It opened and the butler appeared

A telegram for Mr Colton Miss Mabel he said

Give it to me Tell the man to wait Johnson It is from Mr Davis
she exclaimed turning to me I am sure it is Yes See

She handed me the yellow telegram I read the following aloud


James W Colton

Denboro Mass

Galileo potato soap currency tomato deeds command army alcohol thief
weather family


What on earth I exclaimed

That is in the code Fathers private code Dont you see The code
book is here somewhere I must find it

She was rummaging in the drawer of the desk With a sigh of relief she
produced a little blue leathercovered book

Here it is she said Now read me the telegram and I will write the
translation Hurry

I read again

Galileo

That means Consolidated Pacific Go on

It took us five minutes to translate the telegram When we had finished
the result was

Consolidated Pacific crowd wise situation Strong buying close market
today Expect worse tomorrow We are bad shape Can deliver only part
Sure big advance opening and more follow What shall I do Why do
not you answer private telegraph line Telephone out order Wire
instructions immediately Better still come yourself Davis

Is that all asked Miss Colton What answer shall we make

Wait Wait please until I dig some sort of sense out of all this
Wise situation

Wise TO situation I presume that means The Consolidated Pacific
is wise to the situation Wise is slang isnt it It used to be at
college

It is yet even in Denboro Humph let me think Sure big advance
opening I suppose that means the market will open with Louisville
and Transcontinental at a higher figure and that the price is sure to
advance during the day

Yes Yes it must mean that But why should Mr Davis be so excited
about it He said something about ruin over the phone What does We
are bad shape mean And Can deliver only part

I dont know    unless    Humph If we had some particulars Why
dont you answer on the private telegraph as he says

Because I cant Dont you see I cant There is no telegraph operator
in the house When we first came Father had a secretary who could use
the telegraph but he sent him back to New York Said he was sick of the
sight of him They did not get on well together

But your father must have used the telegraph since

Yes Father used it himself He was a telegraph operator when he was
a young man Oh you dont know what a wonderful man my father is His
story is like something in a book HeBut never mind that Hark there
is the instrument going again It must be dreadfully important Mr
Davis is so worried

He seems to be certainly

But what shall we do

I wish I knew but I dont You know nothing of the particulars

No Nothing more than I have told you Oh CANT you help me I feel
somehow as if Father had left me in charge of his affairs and as if I
must not fail Now when he is helpless when he is    Oh cant YOU
do something Mr Paine I thought you might You are a banker

A poor imitation only I am afraid Let me think Did you tell this man
Davis of your fathers illness

No I thought perhaps Father would not wish it And I had no
opportunity    Oh dear there is someone at the door again Who is
it

Johnsons voice replied It is me Miss Mabel he said The telegraph
person says he cant wait any longer He asnt ad his supper And
there is a twentyfivecent charge for bringing the message Miss

Tell him he must wait a minute longer I answered for her Miss
Colton it seems to me that whether we can do anything or not we
should know the particulars Tell that manPhineas Cahoon the depot
master I suppose it isthat there is an answer and he must wait for
it Now lets consult that code

She took the code book and I picked up a sheet of paper and a pencil
from the table

We must ask him to send all the particulars I declared Look up
send in the code Miss Colton

She was turning the pages of the little book when the butler knocked
once more

He says he cant send any message until morning Miss Mabel The
telegraph office closes at eight oclock

The code book fell to the table Miss Colton stared helplessly at me

What SHALL we do she breathed

I rose to my feet Wait Johnson I called Make that man wait a
moment longer Miss Colton I have an idea Would your father be willing
tobut that is silly Of course he would Ill see Cahoon myself

I found Phineas longlegged and gaunt sitting on the front step of the
colonial portico He had been invited into the hall but had refused the
invitation I had on my workin duds he explained later A feller
thats been handlin freight all the afternoon aint fit to set on
goldplated furniture He looked up in surprise as I came out

Well for thunder sakes he exclaimed in astonishment Its Ros
Paine What in the nation are you doin in here Ros Aint married into
the family have ye Haw haw

I could have kicked him for that pleasantryif he had not been just
then too important a personage to kick As it was his chance remark
knocked my errand out of my head momentarily

Hows the old man Ros he whispered They tell me its brought on by
high livin champagne wine and such Is it

Phin said I ignoring the question would you stay up all night for
twenty dollars

He stared at me

What kind of conundrums that he demanded Would I set up all night
for twenty dollars That may be a joke but

Would you I mean it Mr Colton is sick and his daughter needs some
one to send and receive messages over their private telegraph wire She
will pay you twenty dollarsor I will if she doesntif you will stay
here and do that for her Will you

For a minute he sat there staring at me

You mean it Ros he asked slowly You do hey I thought
prapsbut no its long past April Fool day WILL I do it Show me the
telegraph place quick afore I wake up and come out of the ether Twenty
dollars Consarn it I send messages all the week for twelve and hustle
freight and sell tickets into the bargain I aint had no supper but
never mind Make it twentyfive and Ill stay all day tomorrer

I led him into the library and explained his presence to Miss Colton
She was delighted

It is SO good of you Mr Cahoon she exclaimed And you shant
starve either I will have some supper sent in to you at once You can
eat it while you are at work cant you

She hurried out to order the supper Phineas in accordance with my
request seated himself in the little room adjoining the library before
the telegraph instrument

Thunder he observed looking about him I never expected to send
messages for King Solomon in all his glory but I callate I can stand
it if Sol can Spose thered be any objection to my takin off my coat
Comes more natral to work in my shirt sleeves

I bade him take it off and he did so

This fellers in some hurry he said nodding toward the clicking
instrument Shall I tell him were on deck and ready for business

Yes tell him

His long fingers busied themselves with the sender A sharp series of
clicks answered the call Phineas glanced apprehensively out into the
library

Say he aint no parson is he he chuckled Wants to know what in
hell has been the trouble all this time Whatll I tell him

Tell him to send particulars concerning L and T at once All the
particulars

The message was sent The receiver rattled a hasty reply

He says you know all the particulars already You must know em Wants
to know if this is Mr Colton

Tell him Mr Colton is here in the house That will be true enough
And say we wish all particulars figures and all We want to know just
where we stand

The demand for particulars was forwarded There was more clicking

Give me a piece of paper and a pencil quick urged Phineas This is
a long feller

While he was writing the long feller as the telegraph ticked it off
Miss Colton and the butler appeared the latter bearing a loaded tray
He drew a little table up beside the operator and placed the tray upon
it Then he went away The telegraph clicked and clicked and Cahoon
wrote Miss Colton and I watched him anxiously

Say observed Phineas between intervals of clicks this fellers
in some loony asylum aint he This is pretty nigh as crazy as that
message I fetched down    Here tis Maybe you folks know what it
means I dont Its forty fathoms long aint it

It was long enough surely It was not all in the code jargonDavis
trusted the privacy of the wire sufficiently to send a portion of it in
plain Englishbut he did not trust even that altogether Miss Colton
and I worked it out as we had the first telegram As the translation
progressed I could feel my hair tingling at the roots

Was it to help in such a complication as this that I had been summoned
I of all people These waters were too deep for me

Boiled down the particulars for which Davis had been asked and which
he had sent amounted to this Colton it seemed had sold L and T
short for a considerable period of time in order as I had surmised
to force down the price and buy in at a reasonable figure He had sold
in this way about threeeighths of the common stock Of this amount he
had in his possessionin his brokers possession that isbut two
of the eighths The other crowdthe Consolidated Pacific
presumablyhad as Davis now discovered threeeighths actual
certificates in its pocket had been acquiring them on the quiet
while pretending to have lost interest The public unsuspecting
powers in this as in most of Wall Street little games had still
threeeighths The other crowd knowing Big Jims position had but
to force immediate delivery of the missing oneeighththe amount of
Coltons oversellingand he might be obliged to pay Heaven knew what
for the shares He MUST acquire them he must buy them And the price
which he would be forced to pay might meanperhaps not bankruptcy for
him the millionairebut certainly the loss of a tremendous sum and all
chance of acquiring control of the road This has been sprung on us all
at once wired Davis They have got us cold What shall I do You must
be here yourself before the market opens

And the man who must be there himself was critically ill and
unconscious

The long telegram several hundred words of it was before us I read it
through again and Miss Colton sat and looked at me

Do you understand itnow she whispered anxiously

Yes I think I do    What is it Phin

I was just wonderin drawled Cahoons voice from the adjoining room
if I couldnt eat a little mite of this supper Ive got to do it or
have my nose and eyes tied up Havin all them good things settin right
where I can see and smell em is givin me the fidgets

Yes yes eat away I said laughing And even Miss Colton smiled But
my laugh and her smile were but transient

Is itDoes it mean that things are VERY wrong she asked indicating
the telegram

They are very serious there is no doubt of that

The instrument clicked

Say Ros said Phin his mouth full this fellers gettin as fidgety
as I was afore I got afoul of this grub He wants to know what his
instructions are Whatll he do

What shall you tell him asked Miss Colton

I dont know I answered I do not know I am afraid I am of no use
whatever This is no countrymans job No country banker even a
real one should attempt to handle this This is high finance with a
vengeance I dont know I think he    Suppose we tell him to consult
the people at your fathers office

She shook her head No she said The people at the office know
nothing of it This was Fathers own personal affair No one knows of it
but Mr Davis

How about them instructions this from Cahoon

Tell himyes tell him Mr Colton cannot leave here at present and
that he must use his own judgment go ahead on his own responsibility
That is the only thing I see to do Miss Colton Dont worry he must be
a man of experience and judgment or your father never would use him He
will pull it through I am sure

I was by no means as confident as I pretended to be however and the
next message from Davis proved my forebodings to be well founded His
answer was prompt and emphatic


Matter too important Decline to take responsibility Must have definite
instructions or shall not act Is this Mr Colton himself


He would not act without Fathers orders in a matter like this I was
afraid of it And he is growing suspicious Oh CANT you help me Mr
Paine CANT you I relied on you I felt sure YOU would know what to
do I amI am SO alone and with Father so illII

She turned away and leaned her head upon her hand on the table I felt
again the desperate impulse I had felt when we were alone on board the
launch the impulse to take her in my arms and try to comfort her to
tell her that I would do anythinganything for her And yet what could
I do

Cant you help me she pleaded You have never failed me before

There came a knock at the door and Johnsons voice called her name

Miss Mabel he whispered Miss Mabel will you come please The
doctor wants you right away

She rose quickly drawing her hand across her eyes as she did so

I am coming Johnson she said Then turning to me I will be back
as soon as I can Do trytry to think You MUST for Fathers sake for
all our sakes

She left the room I rose and with my hands in my pockets began to
pace the floor This was the tightest place I had ever been in There
had been a time years before when I prided myself on my knowledge
of the stock market and its idiosyncrasies Then in the confidence of
youth I might have risen to a situation like this might have tackled
it and had the nerve to pull it through or blame the other fellow if I
failed Now I was neither youthful nor confident Whatever I did would
be in all human probability the wrong thing and to do the wrong thing
now meant perhaps ruin for the sick man upstairs And she had trusted
me She had sent for me in her trouble I had never failed her before

I walked the floor trying hard to think It was hard to think calmly
to be sensible and yet I realized that commonsense and coolness were
what I needed now I tried to remember the outcome of similar situations
in financial circles but that did not help me I remembered a play I
had seen The Henrietta was its name In that play a young man with
more money than brains had saved the day for his father a Wall Street
magnate by buying a certain stock in large quantities at a critical
time He arrived at his decision to buy rather than sell by tossing a
coin The father had declared that his son had hit upon the real secret
of success in stock speculation Possibly the old gentleman was right
but I could not make my decision in that way No whatever I did must
have some reason to back it Was there no situation outside of Wall
Street which offered a parallel After all what was the situation
Some one wished to buy a certain thing and some one else wished to
buy it also Neither party wanted the other to get it There had been a
general game of bluff and then    Humph Why in a way it was like
the original bidding for the Shore Lane land

It was like it and yet it was not I owned the land and Colton wanted
to buy it so also did Jed Dean Each side had made bids and had been
refused Then the bidders had professedly stood pat but in reality
they had not Jed had told me in his latest interview that he
would have paid almost anything for that land if he had had to And
ColtonColton had invented the Bay Shore Development Company That
company had fooled Elnathan Mullet and other property holders It had
fooled Captain Jed It had come very near to fooling me If Mabel Colton
had not given me the hint I might have been tricked into selling Then
Colton would have won have won on a bluff A good bluff did sometimes
win I wondered   

I was still pacing the floor when Miss Colton returned to the library
She was trying hard to appear calm but I could see that she was greatly
agitated

What is it I asked Is he

He is not as well just now II must not leave himor Mother But I
came back for a moment as I told you I would Is there anything new

No Davis has repeated his declaration to do nothing without orders
from your father

She nodded Very well she said then it is over We are
beatenFather is beaten for the first time It makes little difference
I suppose If heif he is taken from us nothing else matters But
I hoped you    never mind I thank you Mr Paine You would have
helped him if you could I know

Somehow this surrender and the tone in which it was made stirred me
more than all else She had trusted me and I had failed I would not
have it so

Miss Colton I said earnestly supposesuppose I should go ahead
and make this fight on my own hook Suppose I should give Davis the
instructions he is begging for Have I permission to do it

She looked at me in surprise Of course she said simply

Do you mean it It may mean complete smash I am no railroad man no
stock manipulator I have an idea and if this trouble were mine I should
act upon it But it is not mine It is your fathersand yours I may
be crazy to risk such a thing

She stepped forward Do it she commanded I tell you to do it If it
fails I will take the responsibility

That you shall not do But I will take the chance Phin

Yup here I be

Send this message at once Try your hardest to get hold of any shares
you can at almost any figure in reason before the market opens When
it opens begin buying everything offered Got that

Yup Ive got it

Sign it Colton and send it along I am using your fathers name I
added turning to her It seems to me the only way to avoid suspicion
and get action No one must know that Big Jim is critically ill you
understand that

Yes I understand But hesitatingly to buy may mean paying
tremendous prices may it not Can we

We must Here is Daviss reply coming What is it Phin

Cahoon read off the message as the receiver clicked


You are insane Buying at such prices will be suicide


Tell him no Tell him to let it leak out that Colton is seizing the
opportunity to clinch his control of the road The other crowd will
think if he is willing to buy at any price that he cannot be so short
as they supposed Send all that Phin It is a bluff Miss Colton
nothing but a bluff but it may win God knows I hope it will

She did not answer Together we waited for the reply It came as
follows


All right if you say so of course but still think it suicide I am
off on the still hunt for those shares but dont believe one to be had
Consolidated bunch too sharp for that Stay by the wire Will report
when I can Good luck and goodby


Hes gone I callate observed Phineas Need me any more do you
think

Yes You must stay here all night just as I told you

Right you be Send word to the old woman thats all if you can
Callate shes waitin at the kitchen door with a rollin pin by this
time

I will send the word Mr Cahoon replied Miss Colton Anddont you
think you could go home now Mr Paine I know how exhausted you must
be after last night

No home for me I answered with assumed cheerfulness Admirals of
Finance are expected to stick by the ship I will lie down here on the
couch and Phineas can call me if I am needed Dont worry Miss Colton
Go to your father and forget us altogether if you can Ifif I should
be needed forfor any other cause please speak

She looked at me in silence for a moment Then she came toward me and
held out her hand I shall not forget whatever else I may do she
said brokenly And I will speak if I need you my friend

She turned hastily and went to the door

I will send word to your people as well as Mr Cahoons she added
Try and sleep if you can Good night

The door closed behind her Sleep I was not likely to sleep A man who
has lighted the fuse of the powder magazine beneath him does not sleep
much



CHAPTER XXII


And yet sleep I did for a little while just before morning broke I
had spent the night pacing the floor and talking to Phineas who
was wide awake and full of stories and jokes to which I paid little
attention Miss Colton did not come to the library again From the rooms
above I heard occasional sobs and exclamations in Mrs Coltons voice
Once Doctor Quimby peeped in He looked anxious and weary

Hello Ros he hailed I heard you were here This is a high old
night isnt it

How is he I asked

About the same No worse in fact hes better than he was a while ago
But hes not out of the woods yet though Im pretty hopeful for the
old boy has a husky constitutionconsidering the chances hes taken
with it all his life Its his wife that bothers me Shes worse than
one of the plagues of Egypt Ive given her some sleeping powders now
theyll keep her quiet for a spell I hope

And Miss Coltonhow is she

She Shes as calm and sensible and helpful as a trained nurse By the
Almighty she is a wonder that girl Well I must get back on my job
Dont have a millionaire patient every day in the week

At three oclock came a message from Davis He had not been able
to secure a single share Did his instructions to buy still hold I
answered that they did and he replied that he was going to get a nap
for an hour or so I shall need the rest if I am any prophet he
concluded

It was shortly after this that I lay down on the couch I had determined
not to close my eyes but I was utterly worn out I suppose and
exhaustion got the better of me The next thing I knew the gray light of
dawn was streaming in at the library windows and Johnson was spreading a
temptinglooking breakfast on the table

I sprang up

What time is it I demanded

About halfpast five sir or thereabouts was the answer in a tone
of mingled weariness and resentment Plainly Mr Johnson had been up all
night and considered himself imposed upon

I was thankful that my lapse from duty had been of no longer duration
It had been much too long as it was

How is Mr Colton I asked

Better sir I believe He is resting more quiet at present

Where is Cahoon

Here I be this from Phineas in the next room Have a good snooze
did you Ros

Too good I walked in and found him still sitting by the telegraph
instrument Has anything happened I asked

Nary thing All quiet as the tomb since that last message the one you
heard Pretty nigh fell asleep myself I did Guess I should have only
Miss Colton she came in and kept me compny for a spell

Miss Coltonhas she been here Why didnt you call me Ros

I was goin to but she wouldnt let me Said you was all wore out
poor feller and that you want to be disturbed unless twas necessary
Shes an awful nice young woman aint she Nothin stuck up about her
at all Set here and talked with me just as sociable and folksy as if
she want wuth a cent Asked more questions than a few she did

Did she I was not paying much attention to his remarks My mind was
busy with more important things I was wondering what Davis was doing
just then Phin went on

Yup I happened to remember that you want at the bank today and
I asked her if she knew the reason why How did you know he wasnt
there says she Alvin Baker told me fust I says and Sam Wheeler
told him Everybody knew it and was wonderin about it They callated
Ros was sick I told her but that couldnt be or he wouldnt be round
here settin up all night What WAS the reason you want there Ros

I thought it strange that he and everyone else in town did not know
the reason before this Was it possible that Captain Dean alone knew
of my treason to Denboro and that he was keeping the discovery to
himself Why should he keep it to himself He had threatened to drive me
out of town

I had other business today Phin I answered shortly

Yup So I gathered from what Capn Jed said He was in the depot this
noon sendin a telegram and I asked him about you Is Ros sick I
says Huh says heyou know how he grunts Ros for all the world
like a hogHuh says he sick No but I callate hell be pretty
sick afore long What did he mean by that do you spose

I knew but I did not explain I made no reply

Twas a queer sort of talk seemed to me continued Phin I asked him
again why you want at the bank and he said you had other business
just same as you said now He was ugly as a cow with a sore horn over
somethin and I judged twas best to keep still That telegram he sent
was a surprisin thing too Twas tobut there he made me promise
I wouldnt tell and so I mustnt I aint told a soulexcept oneand
then it slipped out afore I thought However that one wont make no
difference She aint interested inin the one the telegram was sent
to taint likely

Where is Miss Colton now I asked

With her ma and pa I presume likely Her and me set and whispered
together for a long spell Land sakes she wouldnt let me speak
loudern a whisper for fear of wakin you up A bodyd think you was a
youngone in arms the care she took of you

Again I did not answer and again the garrulous station master continued
without waiting for a reply

I says to her says I Its a pity George Taylor aint to home I
says I shouldnt wonder if he could help you with this Louisville
stock youre so worried about George was considerble interested in
that stock himself a spell ago I sent much as a dozen telegrams from
him about that very stock to some broker folks up to Boston and they
was mighty anxious telegrams too I tell you I says

He had caught my attention at last

Did you tell her that I demanded

Sure I did I never meant to nuther Aint told another soul You see
George he asked me not to But shes got a way with her that would make
Old Nick confess his sins if she set out to larn em I was sort of
ashamed after I told her and I explained to her that I hadnt ought to
done it But I guess its all right now anyway I says If there was
any trouble along of George and that stock I callate its all over
He acted dreadful worried for a spell but for the week afore he was
married he seemed chipper as ever Biggest change in him you ever see
says I So my tellin you is all right I guess I says Im sure
its all right says she and her face kind of lighted up as you might
say When she looked at me that way Id have given her my house and lot
if shed wanted em though you neednt tell my old woman that I said
so He he Of course its all right she says But you had better
not tell anyone else Well have it for our secret wont we Mr
Cahoon she says smilin Sartin we will says I Andwell by
thunder as if the thought occurred to him for the first time I said
that and now Ive been and blatted out the whole business to you I am
the DARNDEST fool

I did not contradict him I was too angry and disturbed even to speak to
him for the moment And before I could speak we were interrupted The
young lady herself appeared in the doorway SHE had not slept that was
plain Her face was pale and there were dark shadows beneath her eyes
As I looked at her I was more ashamed of my own unpremeditated nap than
ever Yet she was as the doctor had said calm and uncomplaining She
even smiled as she greeted us

Good morning she said Your breakfast is ready Mr Cahoon I know
you feel that you must be getting back to your work at the station

Phineas pulled out an enormous nickel watch and glanced at it

Land sakes most six aint it he exclaimed I guess youre right
Ill have to be trottin along But you neednt fuss for no breakfast
for me Im used to missin a meals vittles now and again and I et
enough last night to last me one spell

He was hurrying from the room but she would not let him go

There has been no fuss whatever Mr Cahoon she said Breakfast is
ready here in the library And yours is ready too Mr Paine I hope
your few minutes sleep has rested you I am sorry you woke so soon I
told Johnson to be careful and not disturb you

I deserve to be shot for sleeping at all I declared in self
reproach I did not mean to I lay down for a moment andwell I
suppose I was rather tired

I know Last nights experience was enough to tire anyone

Nonsense It was no worse for me than for you I said

Yes it was You had the care and the responsibility I you see knew
that I was well guarded Besides I slept for hours this morning Come
both of you Breakfast is ready

Phineas was already seated at the table glancing over his shoulder at
the butler whose look of dignified disgust at being obliged to wait
upon a countryman in his shirt sleeves would have been funny if I had
been in a mood for fun I dont know which was the more uncomfortable
Cahoon or the butler

Wont you join us Miss Colton I asked

Whywhy yes perhaps I will if you dont mind I am not hungry but I
will take a cup of coffee Johnson

Phineas did almost all the talking while he remained with us which was
not long He swallowed his breakfast in a tremendous hurry a proceeding
which still further discomposed the stately Johnson and then rose and
put on his coat

I hate to leave you short handed and on a lee shore Miss he
explained apologetically but I know you understand how tis with me
My jobs all Ive got and Ill have to hang onto it The up trains due
in forty minutes and Ive got to be on hand at the deepo However Ive
got that Davis fellers address and Ill raise him the first thing to
send his messages to me and Ill get em right down here by the reglar
telephone He can use thatwhatdoyoucallitthat code thing if
hes scart of anybodys findin out what he says The boss schoolmarm
of all creation couldnt read that gibberish without the book

I hated to have him go but there was no alternative After he had
gone and she and I were left together at the table a sense of restraint
seemed to fall upon us both To see her sitting opposite me at the
table pouring my coffee and breakfasting with me in this intimate
family fashion was so wonderful and strange that I could think of
nothing else It reminded me in a way of our luncheon at Seaburys
Pond but that had been out of doors an impromptu picnic with all a
picnics surroundings This was different quite different It was so
familiar so homelike so conventional and yet for her and me so
impossible I looked at her and she looking up at the moment caught
my eyes The color mounted to her cheeks I felt my own face flushing
Dorindapractical unromantic Dorindahad guessed my feeling for this
girl Mother had divined it It was plain enough for anyone to read
I glanced apprehensively at the butler half expecting to see upon his
clerical countenance the look of scornful contempt which would prove
that he too was possessed of the knowledge But he merely bent forward
with a deferential Yes sir What is it and I meekly requested
another roll Then I began desperately to talk

I inquired about Mr Coltons condition and was told that he was or
appeared to be a trifle better Mrs Colton was at last thanks to
the doctors powders asleep Johnson left the room for the moment and
I switched to the subject which neither of us had mentioned since the
night before the Louisville and Transcontinental muddle I explained
what had been done and pretended a confidence which I did not feel that
everything would end well She listened but it seemed to me she was
not as interested as I expected At length she interrupted me

Suppose we do not talk about it now she said As I understand it
youwe that ishave made up our minds We have decided to do certain
things which seem to us right Right or wrong they must be done now
I am trying very hard to believe them right and not to worry any more
about them Oh I CANT worry I cant With all the rest IIPlease
let us change the subject Mr Paine I am afraid you must think me
selfish I have said nothing about your own trouble Father
she choked on the name but recovered her composure almost
immediatelyFather told me after his return from your house this
morning that his purchase of the land had become public and that you
were in danger of losing your position at the bank

I smiled That danger is past I answered I have lost it Captain
Dean gave me my walking papers this morning

Oh I am so sorry

I am not I expected it The wonder is only that it has not happened
before I realized that it was inevitable when I made up my mind to
sell It is of no consequence Miss Colton

Yes it is But Father offered you the position in his employ He said
you refused but he believed your refusal was not final

He was wrong It is final

But

I had rather not discuss that Miss Colton

She looked at me oddly and with a faint smile Very well she said
after a moment we will not discuss it now But you cannot suppose that
either Father or I will permit you to suffer on our account

There is no suffering I sold the land to your father deliberately and
with complete knowledge of the consequences As to the bankwell I am
no worse off than I was before I entered its employ I am satisfied

She toyed with her coffee spoon

Captain Dean seems to be the only person in Denboro who knows of the
sale she said Why has he kept it a secret

I dont know Has he

You know he has Mr Paine Mr Cahoon did not know of it and he would
be one of the first to hear It seems odd that the captain should tell
no one

Probably he is waiting for the full particulars He will tell you may
be sure of that His last remark to me was that he should drive me out
of Denboro

I rather expected a burst of indignation In fact I was somewhat hurt
and disappointed that it did not come She merely smiled once more

He has not done it yet she said If he knew why you sold that
landyour real reason for selling ithe would not drive you away or
try to

I was startled and alarmed

What do you mean I asked quickly

If he knew he would not drive you away would he

He will never know

Perhaps he may Perhaps the person for whose sake you sold it may tell
him

Indeed he will not I shall see to that

Oh then there is such a person I was sure of it before Now you have
told me

Before I could recover from the mental disturbance and chagrin which my
slip and her quick seizure of it caused me the butler reentered the
room

Mrs Colton is awake and asking for you Miss Mabel he said The
doctor thinks you had better go to her at once if you please

With a word of apology to me she hurried away I rose from the table I
had had breakfast enough The interruption had come at a fortunate
time for me Her next question might have forced me to decline to
answerwhich would have been equivalent to admitting the truthor to
lie One thing I determined to do without delay I would write Taylor at
once warning him to be more closemouthed than ever Under no conditions
would I permit him to speak If it were necessary I would go to
Washington where he and Nellie were spending their honeymoon and make
him promise to keep silence His telling the truth might ruin him and
it certainly would not help me In the one essential thingthe one
which was clenching my determination to leave Denboro as soon as I could
and seek forgetfulness and occupation elsewhereno one could help me
I must help myself or be miserable always Just now the eternal misery
seemed inevitable no matter what I did

Johnson cleared the table and left me alone in the library The hours
passed Nine oclock came then ninethirty It was almost time for the
stock market to open My thoughts which had been diverted from my rash
plunge into the intricacies of high finance began to return to it As
ten oclock drew near I began to realize what I had bade Davis do and
to think what might happen because of it I Roscoe Paine no longer
even a country banker was at the helm of Big Jim Coltons bark in the
maelstrom of the stock market It would have been funny if it had not
been so desperate And desperate it was sheer reckless desperation and
nothing else I must have been crazier than ever more wildly insane
than I had been for the past month to even think of such a thing It
was not too late yet I could telegraph Davis

The telephone on the desknot the public the local phone but
the other Coltons private wire to New Yorkrang I picked up the
receiver

Helloo Helloo a faint voice was calling Is this Coltons house
at Denboro    Yes this is Davis    The wire is all right now
   Is this Mr Colton speaking

No I answered Mr Colton is here in the house You may give the
message to me

I want to know if his orders hold Am I to buy Ask him I will wait
Hurry The market opens in five minutes

I put down the receiver Now was my opportunity I could back out now
Five minutes more and it would be too late But if I did back outwhat

One of the minutes passed Then another I seized the telephone

Go ahead I shouted Carry out your orders

A faint All right answered me

The die was cast I was in for it There was nothing to do but wait

And I waited alone I walked up and down the floor of the little room
looking at the clock and wondering what was happening on that crowded
floor of the big Broad Street building The market was open Davis was
buying as I had directed But at what figure was he buying

No one came near me not even the butler It was tentwenty before the
bell rang again

Hello This is Mr Daviss office Is this Mr Colton Tell him Mr
Davis says L and T is one hundred and fifty now and jumping twenty
points at a lick There is the devil to pay Scarcely any stock in sight
and next door to a panic Shall we go on buying

I was trying to decide upon an answer when some one touched my elbow
Miss Colton was standing beside me She did not speak but she looked
the question

I told her what I had just heard

One hundred and fifty she exclaimed That isWhy that is dreadful
What will you do

I shook my head That is for you to say I answered

No it is for you You are doing this I trust you Do what you think
is rightyou and Mr Davis That is what Father would wish if he knew

Davis will do nothing on his own responsibility

Then you must do it alone Do it do it

I turned to the phone once more Buy all you can get I ordered
Keep on bidding But be sure and spread the news that it is Colton
buying to secure control of the road not to cover his shorts Be sure
that leaks out Everything depends on that

I hung up the receiver She and I looked at each other

What will happen do you think she asked

God knows    Are you going Dont go

I must gently Father is worse I fear and I must not leave
him Doctor Quimby says the next few hours may tell us whether he
isiswhether he is to be with us or not I must go Be brave I trust
you Be brave forfor I am trying so hard to be

I seized her hand She drew it from my grasp and hastened away Brave
Well for her sake I must be Yet it was because of her that I was such
a coward

As I recall all this now I wonder at myself The whole thing seems too
improbable to be true yet true it was I lost my identity that day
I think and as the telephone messages kept coming and the situation
became more and more desperate became some one else some one a great
deal braver and cooler and more clearsighted than ever I had been or
shall be again I seemed to see my course plainer every moment and to
feel surer of myself and that my methodmy bluff if you likewas the
only salvation

At eleven Louisville and Transcontinental was sellingthe little that
was soldat four hundred and fifty dollars a share on a par value of
fifty At eleventhirty it had climbed another hundred The whole
Street was a Bedlam so they phoned me and the newspapers were issuing
panic extras

Tell Davis to stop buying now I ordered Let it be known that Colton
has secured control and is satisfied

At noon the figure was 700 bid and 800 asked There was no trading at
all for the sufficient reason that no shares were to be had Johnson
came in to ask if he should bring my luncheon I bade him clear out and
let me alone As he was tiptoeing away I called after him

How is Mr Colton I asked

Very bad indeed sir Miss Mabel wished me to say that she could not
leave him an instant It is the crisis the doctor thinks

There were two crises then one on each floor of the big house At one
Davis himself phoned

Still hanging around 700 he announced Begins to look as if the top
had been reached What shall I do now

My plan was ready and I gave my orders as if I had been doing such
things for years

Sell in small lots at intervals I told him Then if the price
breaks begin buying through another broker as cautiously as you can

The answer was in a different tone there was a new note almost of
hope in it

By the Lord I believe you have got it he cried It may work Ill
report to you Mr Colton right away

Plainly he had no doubt that Big Jim was directing the fight in
person Far was it from me to undeceive him

Another interval Then he reported a drop of a hundred points

The bottom is beginning to fall out I honestly believe They think
youve done em again I am spreading the report that you have the
control cinched As soon as the scramble is really on Ill have a half
dozen brokers buying for us

It was halfpast two when the next message came It was exultant
triumphant

Down like an avalanche Am grabbing every share offered Weve got em
sure

And as three oclock struck came the final crow

Hooray for our side Theyre dead and buried You have two hundred
shares more than fifty per cent of the common stock The Louisville
road is in your pocket Mr Colton I congratulate you Might have
known they couldnt lick the old man You are a wonder Ill write full
particulars and then I am going home and to bed Im dead I didnt
believe you could do it How did you

I sat there staring at the phone Then all at once I began to laugh
weakly and hysterically but to laugh nevertheless

II organized a Development Company I gasped Good night

I rose from the chair and walked out into the library I was so
completely fagged out by the strain I had been under that I staggered as
I walked The library door opened and Johnson came in He was beaming
actually beaming with joy

Hes very much better sir he cried Hes conscious and the doctor
says he considers im out of danger now Miss Mabel sent word she would
be down in a short while She cant leave the mistress immediate but
shell be down soon sir

I looked at him in a dazed way Tell Miss Colton that I am very
glad Johnson I said And tell her too that everything here is
satisfactory also Tell her that Mr Paine says her father has his
control

His control And what may that be if you please sir

She will understand Say that everything is all right we have won and
that Mr Colton has his control Dont forget

Andand where will you be sir

I am going home I think I am going home andto bed



CHAPTER XXIII


The next thing I remember with any distinctness is Dorindas knocking
at my bedroom door I remember reaching that bedroom of course and
of meeting Lute in the kitchen and telling him that I was not to be
disturbed that I should not come down to supper and that I wanted to
be let aloneto be let ALONEuntil I saw fit to show myself But these
memories are all foggy and mixed with dreams and nightmares As I say
the next thing that I remember distinctly after staggering from the
Colton library is Dorindas knocking at the door of my bedroom

Ros Roscoe she was calling Can you get up now There is somebody
downstairs waitin to see you

I turned over in bed and began to collect my senses

What time is it Dorinda I asked drowsily

About ten or a little after

Ten Then I had not slept so long after all It was nearly four when
I went to bed and    But what made the room so light There was no
lamp And the windows    I sat up

You dont mean to tell me it is ten oclock IN THE FORENOON I cried

Umhm I hated to disturb you Youve been sleepin like the
everlastin hills and I knew you must be completely wore out But I felt
pretty sartin youd want to see thewho tis that heres to see you so
I decided to wake you up

It is high time you did I should think Ill be down in a minute Who
is it that wishes to see me Dorinda

But Dorinda had gone I dressed hurriedly and descended the stairs to
the diningroom There seated in a chair by the door his eyes closed
his chin resting upon his chest and his aristocratic nose proclaiming
the fact that he slumbered was Johnson the Colton butler I was not
greatly surprised I had rather suspected that my caller might be he or
some other messenger from the big house

He started at the sound of my entrance and awoke

II beg your pardon sir he stammered II beg your pardon sir
Im sure Ive beenI avent closed my eyes for the past two nights
sir and I am tired out Mr Colton wishes to see you at once sir He
wishes you to come over immediately

I was surprised now MR Colton wishes it I repeated You mean Miss
Colton dont you Johnson

No sir It is Mr Colton this time sir Miss Colton is out in the
motor sir

But Mr Colton is too ill to see me or anyone else

No sir he isnt Hes very much better Hes quite himself sir
really And he is very anxious to see you On a matter of business he
says

I hesitated I had expected this though not so soon He wanted to ask
questions concerning my crazy dip into his financial affairs doubtless
Well I should have to see him some time or other and it might as well
be now

I called to Dorinda who was in the kitchen and bade her tell Mother
if she inquired for me that I had gone out but would be back soon
Then Johnson and I walked briskly along the bluff path We entered the
big house

Mr Colton is in his room sir explained the butler You are to see
him there This way sir

But before we reached the foot of the stairs Doctor Quimby came out of
the library He and I shook hands The doctor was a happy man

Well he exclaimed whats the matter with the onehorse countryjay
doctor now hey If there is any one of the Boston specialists at a
hundred a visit who can yank a man out of a serious sickness and put him
on his feet quicker than I can why trot him along thats all I want
to see him Ive been throwing bouquets at myself for the last ten
hours Ho ho Say Ros youll think my head is swelled pretty bad
wont you Ho ho

I asked how the patient was getting on

Fine Tiptop The only trouble is that he ought to keep perfectly
quiet and not do a thing or think of a thing except getting his
strength back for the next week But he hadnt been conscious more than
a couple of hours before he was asking questions about business and so
on He and his daughter had a long confab this morning and after that he
was neither to bind or tie He must see you thats all there was to
it Say Ros what did you and Phin Cahoon and the Colton girl do
yesterday

Oh we put through one of Mr Coltons little trades for him thats
all

Thats all hey Well whatever twas he and I owe you a vote of
thanks He began to get better the minute he heard it Hes feeling so
chipper that if it wasnt that I swore he shouldnt hed have got out
of bed by this time You must go up and see him I suppose but dont
stay too long Hes a wonder for strength and recuperative powers but
dont tire him too much If that wife of his was in Europe or somewhere
Id feel easier Shes the most tiring thing in the house

Johnson led the way upstairs At the chamber door he knocked and
announced my presence

Bring him in What is he waiting for demanded a voice which
considering how recently its owner had been at deaths door was
surprisingly strong I entered the room

He was in bed propped up with pillows Beside him sat Mrs Colton Of
the two she looked the more disturbed Her eyes were wet and she
was dabbing at them with a lace handkerchief Her morning gown was a
wondrous creation Big Jim with his irongray hair awry and his eyes
snapping looked remarkably wide awake and alive

How are you Paine he said Glad to see you Sorry to bring you over
here but I had to see you and that doctor says I must stay in this room
for a while yet He may be right My understanding is pretty shaky Ill
admit Youve met Mrs Colton havent you

I bowed and expressed my pleasure at meeting the lady Her bow was
rather curt but she regarded me with an astonishing amount of agitated
interest Also she showed symptoms of more tears

I dont remember whether or not Mr Paine and I have ever been formally
introduced she observed If we havent it makes no difference I
suppose The other members of the family seem to know him well enough
Andand mothers nowadays are not considered II must say that

She had recourse to the lace handkerchief I could understand what the
doctor meant by calling her the most tiring thing in the house Her
husband laid a hand on hers

There there my dear he said soothingly dont be foolish Sit
down Paine Henrietta perhaps you had better leave Mr Paine and I
together We have someerbusiness matters to discuss and you are
tired and nervous I should go to my room and lie down if I were you

Mrs Colton accepted the suggestion but her acceptance was not the most
gracious

I am in the way as usual she observed chokingly Very well I
should be resigned to that by this time no doubt I will go But James
for my sake dont be weak Remember whatOh remember all we had hoped
and planned When I think of it IIA nobody A person without   
What SHALL I do

The handkerchief was in active operation She swept past me to the door
There she turned

I may forgive you some time Mr Paine she sobbed I suppose I shall
have to I cant do anything else But dont ask me to do it now That
would be TOO much

The door closed and I heard her sobs as she marched down the hall To
say that I was amazed and decidedly uncomfortable would be a very mild
estimate of my feelings Why should I expect her to forgive me What had
I done Ior luck and I togetherhad saved one of her husbands stock
speculations from ending in smash but that was no injury for which I
should beg forgiveness At least I could not see that it was

Colton looked after her with a troubled expression

Nerves are the devil arent they he observed And nerves and a
woman together are worse than that My wife Paine iswell she hasnt
been in good health for a long time and Mabel and I have done our best
to give her her own way When youve had your own way for years it
rather hurts to be checkmated I know that from experience Shell feel
better about it by and by

Better about what I demanded involuntarily I dont understand Mrs
Coltons meaning in the least

He looked at me keenly for a moment without speaking

Dont you he asked You are sure you dont

Certainly I am sure What I have done that requires forgiveness I dont
see

Another pause and more scrutiny

So you dont understand what she means hey he said again All
right all right We wont discuss that yet a while If you dont
understandnever mind Time enough for us to talk of that when you do
But say Paine with one of his dry smiles who taught you to buck a
stock pool

This question I could understand I had expected this

No one taught me I answered If I had any knowledge at all in that
direction I was born with it I guess A form of original sin

Its a mighty profitable sort of wickednessfor me Young man do you
realize what you did How do you expect me to thank you for that hey

I dont expect you to thank me at all It was bull luck that won for
you Mr Colton Bull luck and desperation on my part Miss Colton sent
for me to help her Your confidential man Davis refused to make a move
without orders from you You couldnt give any orders Someone had to do
something or so it seemed to your daughter and me your Louisville and
Transcontinental deal was a gone goose

It was more than that I might have come pretty near being a gone goose
along with it Not quite gone perhapsI should have had a few cents
left in the stockingbut I should have lost a lot more than I care to
lose So it was bull luck hey I dont believe it Tell me the whole
story from beginning to end will you Mabel has told me some but I
want to hear it all Go ahead

I thought of Quimbys warning Im afraid I should tire you Mr
Colton It is a long story if I give particulars

Never mind you give them That tiring business is some more of that
doctors foolishness HE makes me tired all right You tell me what I
want to know or Ill get out of this bed and shake it out of you

He looked as if he meant to carry out his threat I began my tale at the
beginning and went on to the astonishing end

Dont ask me why I did this or that Mr Colton I concluded I dont
know I think I was off my head part of the time But something HAD to
be done I tried to look at the affair in a commonsense way and

And HAVING commonsense you used it Paine youre a brick Your kind
of commonsense is so rare that its worth paying any price for Ha ha
So it was Keene and his Development Company that gave you the idea
Thats good That little failure of mine wasnt altogether a failure
after all You saw it was a case where a bluff might win and you had
the sand to bluff it through That comes of living so long where there
is more sand than anything else I imagine hey Ha ha Well bull luck
or insanity or whatever you call it it did the trick Of course Im
more obliged to you than I can tell You know that

Thats all right Mr Colton Now I think I must be going Youve
talked enough

You sit still I havent begun to talk yet Paine before you did this
thing for me I had taken a fancy to you I believed there was good
stuff in you and that I could use you in my business Now I know I cant
afford to do without you    Stop let me finish Young man I told
you once that when I made up my mind to do a thing I always did it
ALWAYS do you understand I am going to get you You are coming with
me

I had foreseen this of course But I had hoped to get away from that
room before he reached the point He had reached it however and
perhaps it was as well he had We would end this for all time

Mr Colton I answered you have a monopoly of some things but of
others you have not I am just as determined to have my own way in this
matter as you are I shall NOT accept your offer of employment That is
final

Final be damned Young man

Mr Colton if you persist I shall go away

Go away Before I tell you to Why you

I rose The doctor told me that you must not excite yourself I said
I am going Goodby

He was excited there was no doubt of that He sat up in bed

You come back he ordered Come back If you dontWell by the
Lord if you dont Ill get up and come after you

I believe he would have tried to do it I was frightened on his
account I turned reluctantly He sank back on the pillow grinning
triumphantly

Sit down there he panted Sit down Now I want you to tell me the
real reason why you wont work for me By gad youre the first one in
many a day I have had to ask twice Why Tell me the truth Why

I hesitated Well for one reason I said I dont care for your
business

Dont CARE for it After what you just did

I did that because I was driven to it But I dont care for the stock
game Once I used to think I liked that sort of thing now I know I
dont If I am anything I am a bank man a poor sort of one perhaps
but

Bank man Why you idiot I dont care what you are I can use you in
a dozen places You dont have to buck the market Ill do that myself
But there are plenty of places where your brains and that commonsense
you talk about will be invaluable to me I do a banking business on the
side myself I own a mining property a good one out West It needs a
financial manager and needs one badly You come with me do you hear
Ill place you where you fit before I get through with you and Ill
make you a rich man in ten years There now will you say yes

I shook my head No I said

NO You are enough to drive a well man crazy to say nothing of a
halfsick relic like me _I_ say yesyesYES Sooner or later Ill
MAKE you Youve lost your place here You told me yourself that that
old crank Dean is going to make this town too hot to hold you Youll
HAVE to go away Now wont you

I nodded I shall go away I answered I have made up my mind to go
now that Mother seems well enough for me to leave her

Where will you go

I dont know

He stared at me in silence for what seemed a long time I thought he
must be exhausted and once more I rose to go

Stop Stay where you are he ordered I havent got the answer to
you yet and I know it Theres something back of all this something
I dont know about Im going to find out what it is if it takes me a
year You can tell me now if you want to It will save time What is
the real reason why you wont take my offer

I dont know why I did it I had kept the secret all the years and
certainly when I entered that room I had no intention of revealing it
Yet now when he asked this question I turned on him and blurted out
what I had sworn no oneleast of all he or hisshould ever know

Ill tell you why I cried desperately I cant take the place you
offer because you know nothing about me You dont know who I am If you
did you     Mr Colton you dont even know my name

He looked at me and shook his head impatiently Either you ARE crazy
or I am he muttered Dont know your name

No you dont You think I am Roscoe Paine I am not I am Roscoe
Bennett and my father was Carleton Bennett the embezzler

I had said it And the moment afterward I was sorry I would have given
anything to take back the words but repentance came too late I had
said it

I heard him draw a deep breath I did not look at him I did not care
to see his face and read on it the disgust and contempt I was sure it
expressed

Humph he exclaimed Humph Do you mean to tell me that your father
was Carleton BennettBennett of Bennett and Company

Yes

Well well well Carleton Bennett No wonder there was something
familiar about your mother something that I seemed to remember I met
her years ago Well well So youre Carleton Bennetts son

Yes I am his son

Well what of it

I looked at him now He was smiling actually smiling His illness had
affected his mind

What OF it I gasped

Yees what of it What has that got to do with your working for me

I could have struck him If he had not been weak and ill and
irresponsible for what he was saying I think I should

Mr Colton I said striving to speak calmly you dont understand
My father was Carleton Bennett the embezzler the thief the man whose
name was and is a disgrace all over the country Mother and I came here
to hide from that disgrace to begin a new clean life under a clean
name Do you think Oh you dont understand

I understand all right This is the first time I HAVE understood I see
now why a clever man like you was willing to spend his days in a place
like Denboro Well you arent going to spend any more of them there
Youre going to let me make something worth while out of you

This sounded in one way like sanity But in another

Mr Colton I cried even if you meant it which you dontdo you
suppose I would go back to New York where so many know me and enter
your employ under an assumed name Run the risk of

Hush Enter it under your own name Its a good name The Bennetts are
one of our oldest families Ask my wife shell tell you that

A good name

Yes I declare PaineBennett I meanI shall begin to believe you
havent got the sense I credited you with I can see what has been
the matter with you You came here you and your sick mother with the
scandal of your fathers crookedness hanging over you and her sickness
making her supersensitive and you two kept the secret and brooded over
it so long that you have come to think you are criminals too Youre
not You havent done anything crooked Whats the matter with you man
Be sensible

Sensible

Yes sensible if you can I dont care who your father was He was
a smart banker before he went wrong and I can see now where you
inherited your ability But never mind that Hes dead let him stay so
Im not trying to get him Its you I want

You want ME Do you mean you would take me into your employ knowing
who I am

Sure It is because I know WHAT you are that I want you

Mr Colton youI dont know what to say to you

Try saying yes and see how it seems It will be a change anyhow

No no I cannot it is impossible

Oh you make me weary    Humph What is it now Any more
reasons

Yes I faced him squarely Yes I said there is another reason
one that makes it impossible utterly impossible if nothing else did
When I tell you what it is you will understand what I mean and agree
with me Your daughter and I have been thrown together a great deal
since she came to Denboro Our meetings have not been of my seeking nor
of hers Of late I have realized that for my own sake for the sake of
my peace of mind I must not meet her I must not be where she is I

Here Stop he broke in sharply What is this Do you mean to tell me
that you and Mabel

It is not her fault It is my own entirely Mr Colton I

Stop I tell you Do you mean to tell me that you arethat you have
been making love to my daughter

No Certainly not

Then what do you mean That she has been making love to you

Mr Colton

There Dont act like the Wild Man of Borneo Do you mean that you are
in love with her

Dont you see now why I cannot accept I must go away I am going

Humph That will do    Humph Well PaineBennett I should say
it is hard to keep track of your namesyou are rathererreckless
it seems to me Mabel is our only child and her mother and I
naturally had planned for her future    Have you told her of
yourrecklessness

Of course not I shall not see her again I shall leave Denboro as soon
as I can She will never know

Humph I see    I see    Well I dont know that there is
anything for me to say

There is not

I am sorry for you of course

Thank you

There was a sharp rap at the door Doctor Quimby opened it and entered
the room He glanced from me to his patient and his face expressed sharp
disapproval

Youd better go Ros he snapped What is the matter with you Didnt
I tell you not to excite him

IM not excited observed Colton drily

Clear out this minute continued the angry doctor Ros Paine I
thought you had more sense

So did I this from Big Jim However I am learning a lot these
days Goodby Paine

I was at the door

Oh by the way he called after me let me make a suggestion If I
were you Roscoe I wouldnt leave Denboro today Not before tomorrow
morning at any rate

I did not understand him and I asked for no explanation It was the
first time he had addressed me by my Christian name but it was not
until afterward that I remembered that fact



That afternoon I was alone in my haven of refuge the boathouse Mother
and I had had a long talk I told her everything that had transpired
I kept back nothing either of my acts or my feelings She said she was
not sorry for what I had done She was rather glad than otherwise that
I had disclosed our secret to Mr Colton

He knows now Roscoe she said And he was right too You and I have
brooded over our sorrow and what we considered our disgrace much more
than we should He is right Boy We are innocent of any wrongdoing

Yes Mother I answered I suppose we are But we must keep the
secret still No one else in Denboro must know You know what gossip
there would be There is enough now I presume I am called a traitor and
a blackguard by every person in the town

Why no you are not That is the strange thing about it Luther was up
at the postoffice this morning and no one seems to know of your sale of
the land Captain Dean has apparently kept the news to himself Why do
you suppose he does that

I dont know I dont know unless it is because heno I cant
understand it at all However they will know soon enough By the way
I have never asked Dorinda where Lute was that noonit seems ages
agowhen he was missing at dinner time And how did he know of Mr
Coltons illness

She smiled Poor Luther she said He announced his intention of
running away you remember As a matter of fact he met the Coltons
chauffeur in the motor car and the chauffeur invited him to go to
Bayport with him The chauffeur had an errand there Lute acceptedas
he says automobile rides dont come his way every day in the weekand
they had trouble with the engine and did not get back until almost
night Then Miss Colton told him of her fathers seizure and gave him
the note for you It was to you she turned in her trouble Boy She
trusts you Roscoe II think she

Dont say it Mother All that is ended I am going to forgetif I
can

The rest of our conversation need not be written here She said many
things such as fond mothers say to their sons and which the sons know
too well they do not deserve We discussed my leaving Denboro and she
was so brave and selfsacrificing that my conscience smote me

Ill stay Mother I said I cant leave you Ill stay and fight it
out with you After all it will not be much worse than it was before I
went to the bank

But she would not hear of my staying I had a friend in Chicago a
distant relative who knew our story Perhaps he could help me to a start
somewhere She kissed me and bade me keep up my courage and I left
her I ate a hurried meal a combination of breakfast and dinner and
dodging Lute who was in the back yard waiting to question me concerning
the Coltons walked down to the boathouse There in my armchair I
tried to think to map out some sort of plan for my future

It was a hopeless task I was not interested in it I did not much care
what became of me If it were not for Mother I should not have cared at
all Nevertheless for her sake I must try to plan and I did

I was still trying when I heard footsteps approaching the door the
small door at the side not the big one in front I did not rise to open
the door nor did I turn my head The visitor was Lute probably and if
I kept still he might think I was not within and go away again

The door opened Here he is said a voice a voice that I recognized
I turned quickly and sprang to my feet Standing behind me was Captain
Jedediah Dean and with him George TaylorGeorge Taylor who should have
beenwhom I had supposed to be in Washington with his bride

Here he is said Captain Jed again Well Ros weve come to see
you

But I paid no attention to him It was his companion I was staring at
What was he doing here

George I cried GEORGE

He stepped forward and held out his hand He was smiling but there was
a look in his eye which expressed the exact opposite of smiles

Ros he said quietly Ros Paine you bullheaded bighearted old
chump how are you

But I could only stare at him Why had he come to Denboro What did his
coming to me mean Why had he come with Captain Jed the man who had
vowed that he was done with me forever And why was the captain looking
at me so oddly

George I cried in alarm George you haventyou havent made a
fool of yourself You havent

Captain Jed interrupted me He aint the fool Ros he said That
is he aint now Im the fool I ought to have known better Ros II
dont knows youll give it to me but anyhow Im goin to ask it I beg
your pardon

Ros said Taylor before I could reply dont stand staring as if
you were petrified Sit down and let me look at you You pigheaded old
idiot you What do you mean by it What did you do it for

He pushed me into the chair I had just vacated Captain Dean took
another George remained standing

He IS petrified I do believe he exclaimed

But my petrification was only temporary I was beginning to understand
and to be more alarmed than ever

What are you doing here in Denboro I demanded

Captain Jed answered for him Hes here because I telegraphed for him
yesterday he said I wired him to come straight home and take charge
of the bank I had fired you like the dumb fool I was and I wanted him
to take command He got here on the mornin train

I remembered what Phin Cahoon had said about the telegram and the
captains making him promise not to mention the name of the person to
whom it was sent It was George of course If I had been in a normal
state of mind when Phin told me I should have guessed as much

Taylor took up the conversation Yes I got here he said And when
I got hereor a little before with a glance at the captainI found
out what had been going on since I left You old chump Ros Paine What
did you do it for

I looked at him and then at his companion What I saw there confirmed my
worst suspicions

George I said if you have told him you must be crazy

I was crazy not to tell him before I was crazy not to guess what you
had been up to But I didnt suppose anybody would be crazy enough to do
what you did Ros I didnt imagine for a minute that you would be crazy
enough to throw away your job and get yourself into the trouble you knew
was sure to come just to help me To help ME by the Lord Ros Ros
what can I say to you

Youve said enough and more than enough I answered bitterly I did
what I did so that you might keep your secret I did it to help you and
Nellie And if you had kept still no one need ever have known no one
but you and I George And now you

Shut up Ros he interrupted Shut up I tell you Why confound
you what do you think I am Do you suppose I would let you sacrifice
yourself like that while I set still and saw you kicked out of town
What do you think I am

But what was the use of it I demanded It was done Nothing you
could say would change it For Nellies sake

There there broke in Captain Jed Nellie knows George told her the
day they was married He told her before they was married He was man
enough to do that and I honor him for it If hed only come to me then
it would have been a mighty sight better Id have understood when I
heard about your sellin Colton the land and I wouldnt have made
a jackass of myself by treatin you as I done You the man that
sacrificed yourself to keep my girl from breakin her heart When I
think what you saved us all from IIBy the Almighty Ros Paine Ill
make it up to you somehow I will I swear I will

He turned away and looked out of the window George laid a hand on his
shoulder

I am the one to make it up Capn he said solemnly If I live Ill
make it up to Ros here and to you and to Nellie God bless her I
expected you would never speak to me again when Id told you Telling
younext to telling Nelliewas the toughest job I ever tackled But
Ill make it up to you both and to Ros Thank the Lord it aint too
late to make it up to him

Well both make it up to him George replied Captain Jed As far
as we can we will If he wants to come back to the bank this minute he
can Well be proud to have him But I callate with a smile hell
have bigger fish to fry than we can give him If what weve just heard
is true he will

I dont know what you mean I answered And as for the bankwell
you forget one thing I sold the Shore Lane and the town knows it How
long would the other directors tolerate me in that bank after that do
you think

To my surprise they looked at each other and laughed Captain Dean shook
his head

No he said youre mistook Ros The town dont know you sold it
I didnt tell em because I wanted George in command of that bank afore
the row broke loose I larned of the sale myself by chance over to
Ostable and I never told anybody except Dorindy Rogers and her fool of
a husband Ill see that they keep still tongues in their heads And as
for the Lanewell that wont be closed Colton dont own it no more

Dont OWN it I repeated Dont own it He does I sold it to him
myself

Yes And George here bought it back not an hour ago We saw His
Majestysick in bed he was but just as high and mighty and independent
as everand George bought back the land and the Lane for thirtyfive
hundred dollars The old man didnt seem to give a durn about it any
more Hed had his own way he said and that was all he cared about
Besides he aint goin to stay in Denboro much longer The old
ladyhis wifeis sick of the place and he only come here on her
account He callates that New York is good enough for him I callate
tis Anyhow Denboro wont hang onto his coattails to hold him back
Tell Ros the whole story George

George told it beginning with his receipt of his fatherinlaws
telegram and his hurried return to the Cape He had gone directly to
Captain Dean and confessed the whole thing The captain had behaved like
a trump I learned Instead of denouncing his daughters husband he had
forgiven him freely Then they had gone to see Colton and George had
bought the land

And I shall give it to the town he said Its the least I can do
You wonder where the money came from Ros I guess you aint seen the
newspapers There was a high old time in the stock market yesterday and
Louisville and Transcontinental climbed halfway to the moon From being
a pauper Im pretty well fixed

Im heartily glad of it George I said But there is one thing I
dont understand You say you learned of my selling the land before you
reached Denboro Captain Jed says no one but he and my people knew it
How did you find it out

Again my two callers looked at each other

Why somebodya friend of yourscome to me at the Ostable station and
dragged Nellie and me off the train We rode with that person the rest
of the way andthe said person told us what had happened and begged
us to help you Seemed to have made a middling good guess that I COULD
help if I would

A persona friend of mine Why I havent any friend any friend who
knew the truth or could guess

Yes you have

Who was it

George laughed aloud and Captain Jed laughed with him

I guess I shant tell you said the former I promised I wouldnt



CHAPTER XXIV


They left me soon after this I tried to make them tell who the
mysterious friend might be but they refused The kind things they said
and the gratitude they both expressed I shall never forget They did not
strenuously urge me to return to the bank and that seemed strange to
me

The jobs yours if you want it Ros said Captain Jed Wed be only
too happy to have you if youd comeany time sooner or later But I
dont think you will

No I answered I shall not I have made other plans I am going to
leave Denboro

That did not seem to surprise them and I was still more puzzled They
shook hands and went away promising to call at the house that evening
and bring Nellie

She wants to thank you too Ros said George

After they had gone I sat by the big door looking out at the bay
smooth and beautiful in the afternoon sunlight and thinking of what
they had told me For Mothers sake I was very glad It would be easier
for her after I had gone the townspeople would be friendly instead
of disagreeable For her sake I was glad For myself nothing seemed to
make any difference George Taylors wordsthose he had spoken to me
that fateful evening when I found him with the revolver beside himcame
back to me over and over Wait until your time comes Wait until the
girl comes along that you care for more than the whole world And then
see what youd do See what it would mean to give her up

I was seeing I knew now what it meant

I rose and went out of the boathouse I did not care to meet anyone or
speak with anyone I strolled along the path by the bluff my old walk
that which I had taken so many times and with such varied feelings
never with such miserable ones as now

The goldenrod always late blooming on the Cape bordered the path with
gorgeous yellow The leaves of the scrub oaks were beginning to turn
though not to fall I walked on and entered the grove where she and I
had met after our adventure with Carver and the stranded skiff I turned
the bend and saw her coming toward me

I stood still and she came on came straight to me and held out her
hand

I was waiting for you she said I was on my way to your house and I
saw you comingso I waited

You waited I stammered Why

Because I wished to speak to you and I did not want thatthat Mr
Rogers of yours to interrupt me Why did you go away yesterday without
even letting me thank you for what you had done Why did you do it

Becausebecause you were very busy andand I was tired I went home
and to bed

You were tired You must have been But that is no excuse no good one
I came down and found you were gone without a word to me And you had
done so much for mefor my father

Your father thanked me this morning Miss Colton I saw him in his room
and he thanked me I did not deserve thanks I was lucky that was all

Father does not call it luck He told me what you said to him

He told you Did he tell you all I told him

II think so He told me who you were what your real name was

He did And you were still willing to meet me

Yes Why not Does it make any difference that you are Mr
Bennettinstead of Mr Paine

But my father was Carleton BennettthetheYou must have heard of
him

I never knew your father I do know his son And I am very proud to
know him

Butbut Miss Colton

Tell me she interrupted quickly have you seen Mr Taylor He is
here in Denboro

Yes I have seen him

And he told you about the Lane That he has bought it

Yes

And you will not be with a smile driven from Denboro by that cross
old Captain Dean

I shall not be drivenno

Then Mr Taylor did help you He promised me he would

He promised you When When did you see George Taylor

She appeared confused IIOf course I saw him at the house this
noon when he came to see Father

But he could not have promised you then He had helped me already Did
you see him before that

Why how could I I

Miss Colton answer me Was it you that met him at the Ostable station
this morning Was it

She was as red as the reddest of the autumn leaves She laughed
confusedly

I did meet him there she confessed That queer Mr Cahoon the
station agent told me that Captain Dean had telegraphed him to come
I knew he would probably be on that train And Mr Cahoon told me about
his being interested in stocks and very much troubled You had told me
or as much as told me that you sold the land to get money to help some
one I put two and two together and I guessed the rest I met him and
Nellie and we rode to Denboro together in our auto He promised me that
he would make everything right for you I am so glad he did

I caught my breath with a gasp

You did that I exclaimed You did that for me

Why not Surely you had done enough forus I could not let you be
driven from town you know

I did not speak I knew that I must not attempt a reply I should say
too much She looked up at me and then down again at the pineneedles
beneath our feet

Father says he intends to do great things for you she went on He
says you are to come with him He is enthusiastic about it He believes
you are a great man No one but a great man he says could beat the
Consolidated Pacific gang singlehanded He says you will be the best
investment he ever made

I am afraid not I answered Your father made me a generous offer I
wish I might have been able to accept it but I could not

Oh but you are going to accept

No I am not

He says you are And he always has his way you know

Not in this case Miss Colton

But _I_ want you to accept Surely you will do it to oblige me

II cant

What are you going to do go back to the bank

No I am going to leave Denboro I dont know where I shall go This is
goodby Miss Colton It is not likely that we shall meet again

But why are you going

I cannot tell you

She was silent still looking down at the pineneedles I could not see
her face I was silent also I knew that I ought to go that I should
not remain there with her another moment Yet I remained

So you think this is our parting she said I do not

Dont you I fear you are wrong

I am not wrong You will not go away MrBennett At least you will
not until you go where my father sends you You will accept his offer I
think

You are mistaken

No I think I am not mistaken I think you will accept it
becausebecause I ask you to

I cannot Miss Colton

And your reason

That I cannot tell anyone

But you told my father

I was stricken dumb again

She went on speaking hurriedly and not raising her eyes

You told my father she repeated and he told me

He told you I cried

Yes he told me II am not sure that he was greatly surprised He
thought it honorable of you and he was very glad you did tell him but I
think he was not surprised

The oaks and the pines and the huckleberry bushes were dancing great
giddygorounds a reflection of the whirlpool in my brain Out of the
maelstrom I managed to speak somehow

He was not surprised I repeated He was notnotWhat do you mean

She did not answer She drew away from me a step but I followed her

Why wasnt he surprised I asked again

BecausebecauseOh I dont know What have I been saying IPlease
dont ask me

But why wasnt he surprised

Becausebecause she hesitated Then suddenly she looked up into my
face her wonderful eyes alight Because she said I had told him
myself sir

I seized her hands

YOU had told him You had told him that II

No with a swift shake of the head not you II did not know
thatthen I told him that I

But I did not wait to hear any more



Some time after thatI do not know how long after and it makes no
difference anywayI began to remember some resolutions I had made
resolves to be selfsacrificing and all that sort of thing

But my dear I faltered I am insane I am stark crazy How can I
think of such a thing Your motherwhat will she say

She looked up at me looking up was not as difficult now and besides
she did not have to look far She looked up and smiled

I think Mother is more reconciled she said Since she learned who
you were she seems to feel better about it

I shook my head ruefully Yet she referred to me as a nobody only
this morning I observed

Yes but that was before she knew you were a Bennett The Bennetts are
a very good family so she says And she informed me that she always
expected me to throw myself away so she was not altogether unprepared

I sighed Throwing yourself away is exactly what you have done Im
afraid I answered

She put her hand to my lips Hush she whispered At all events I
made a lucky throw Im very glad you caught me dear

There was a rustle of leaves just behind us and a startled exclamation
I turned and saw Lute Rogers standing there in the path an expression
on his face which I shall not attempt to describe for no description
could do justice to it We looked at Lute and he looked at us

He was the first to recover

My time exclaimed Lute My TIME

He turned and fled

Come here I shouted after him Come back here this minute Lute
come back

Lute came looking shamefaced and awkward

Where were you going I demanded

II was callatin to go and tell Dorindy he faltered

Youll tell nobody Nobody do you hear Ill tell Dorinda myself
when it is necessary What were you doing here spying on me in that
fashion

II want spyin Ros Honest truth I want II didnt know you and
she waswas

Never mind that What were you doing here

I was chasin after you Ros I just heard the most astonishing thing
Jed Dean was to the house to make Dorindy and me promise to say nothin
about that Shore Lane cause you never sold it and he said Mr Colton
had offered you a turrible fine job along of him and that you was goin
to take it I wanted to find you and ask it twas true Taint true is
it Ros wistfully By time I wish twas

Before I could answer Mabel spoke

Yes it is true Mr Rogers she said It is quite true and you may
tell anyone you like It is true isnt it Roscoe

What answer could I make What answer would you have made under the
circumstances

Yes I answered with a sigh of resignation I guess it is true
Lute
