Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The Tragedie of Cymbeline




Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The Tragedie of Cymbeline

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

The Tragedie of Cymbeline

Actus Primus Scoena Prima

Enter two Gentlemen

 1Gent You do not meet a man but Frownes
Our bloods no more obey the Heauens
Then our Courtiers
Still seeme as dos the Kings

 2 Gent But whats the matter
 1 His daughter and the heire ofs kingdome whom
He purposd to his wiues sole Sonne a Widdow
That late he married hath referrd her selfe
Vnto a poore but worthy Gentleman Shes wedded
Her Husband banishd she imprisond all
Is outward sorrow though I thinke the King
Be touchd at very heart

 2 None but the King
 1 He that hath lost her too so is the Queene
That most desird the Match But not a Courtier
Although they weare their faces to the bent
Of the Kings lookes hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowle at

 2 And why so
 1 He that hath missd the Princesse is a thing
Too bad for bad report and he that hath her
I meane that married her alacke good man
And therefore banishd is a Creature such
As to seeke through the Regions of the Earth
For one his like there would be something failing
In him that should compare I do not thinke
So faire an Outward and such stuffe Within
Endowes a man but hee

 2 You speake him farre

 1 I do extend him Sir within himselfe
Crush him together rather then vnfold
His measure duly

 2 Whats his name and Birth
 1 I cannot delue him to the roote His Father
Was calld Sicillius who did ioyne his Honor
Against the Romanes with Cassibulan
But had his Titles by Tenantius whom
He serud with Glory and admird Successe
So gaind the Suraddition Leonatus
And had besides this Gentleman in question
Two other Sonnes who in the Warres oth time
Dyde with their Swords in hand For which their Father
Then old and fond of yssue tooke such sorrow
That he quit Being and his gentle Lady
Bigge of this Gentleman our Theame deceast
As he was borne The King he takes the Babe
To his protection cals him Posthumus Leonatus
Breedes him and makes him of his Bedchamber
Puts to him all the Learnings that his time
Could make him the receiuer of which he tooke
As we do ayre fast as twas ministred
And ins Spring became a Haruest Liud in Court
Which rare it is to do most praisd most loud
A sample to the yongest to th more Mature
A glasse that feated them and to the grauer
A Childe that guided Dotards To his Mistris
For whom he now is banishd her owne price
Proclaimes how she esteemd him and his Vertue
By her election may be truly read what kind of man he is

 2 I honor him euen out of your report
But pray you tell me is she sole childe toth King
 1 His onely childe
He had two Sonnes if this be worth your hearing
Marke it the eldest of them at three yeares old
Ith swathing cloathes the other from their Nursery
Were stolne and to this houre no ghesse in knowledge
Which way they went

 2 How long is this ago
 1 Some twenty yeares

 2 That a Kings Children should be so conueyd
So slackely guarded and the search so slow
That could not trace them

 1 Howsoere tis strange
Or that the negligence may well be laughd at
Yet is it true Sir

 2 I do well beleeue you

 1 We must forbeare Heere comes the Gentleman
The Queene and Princesse

Exeunt

And with mine eyes Ile drinke the words you send
Though Inke be made of Gall
Enter Queene

 Qu Be briefe I pray you

 Imo Then waud his Handkerchiefe
 Pisa And kist it Madam

 Imo Senselesse Linnen happier therein then I

 Pisa No Madam for so long
As he could make me with his eye or eare
Distinguish him from others he did keepe
The Decke with Gloue or Hat or Handkerchife
Still wauing as the fits and stirres ofs mind
Could best expresse how slow his Soule sayld on
How swift his Ship

 Imo Thou shouldst haue made him
As little as a Crow or lesse ere left
To aftereye him

 Pisa Madam so I did

 Imo I would haue broke mine eyestrings
Crackd them but to looke vpon him till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharpe as my Needle
Nay followed him till he had melted from
The smalnesse of a Gnat to ayre and then
Haue turnd mine eye and wept But good Pisanio
When shall we heare from him

 Pisa Be assurd Madam
With his next vantage

 Imo I did not take my leaue of him but had
Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him
How I would thinke on him at certaine houres
Such thoughts and such Or I could make him sweare
The Shees of Italy should not betray
Mine Interest and his Honour or haue chargd him
At the sixt houre of Morne at Noone at Midnight
T encounter me with Orisons for then
I am in Heauen for him Or ere I could
Giue him that parting kisse which I had set
Betwixt two charming words comes in my Father
And like the Tyrannous breathing of the North
Shakes all our buddes from growing
Enter a Lady

 La The Queene Madam
Desires your Highnesse Company

 Imo Those things I bid you do get them dispatchd
I will attend the Queene

 Pisa Madam I shall

Scena Quinta

Enter Philario Iachimo a Frenchman a Dutchman and a
Spaniard

 Iach Beleeue it Sir I haue seene him in Britaine hee
was then of a Cressent note expected to proue so woorthy
as since he hath beene allowed the name of But I
could then haue lookd on him without the help of Admiration
though the Catalogue of his endowments had
bin tabled by his side and I to peruse him by Items

 Phil You speake of him when he was lesse furnishd
then now hee is with that which makes him both without
and within

 French I haue seene him in France wee had very many
there could behold the Sunne with as firme eyes as
hee

 Iach This matter of marrying his Kings Daughter
wherein he must be weighed rather by her valew then
his owne words him I doubt not a great deale from the
matter

 French And then his banishment

 Iach I and the approbation of those that weepe this
lamentable diuorce vnder her colours are wonderfully
to extend him be it but to fortifie her iudgement which
else an easie battery might lay flat for taking a Begger
without lesse quality But how comes it he is to soiourne
with you How creepes acquaintance
 Phil His Father and I were Souldiers together to
whom I haue bin often bound for no lesse then my life
Enter Posthumus

Heere comes the Britaine Let him be so entertained amongst
you as suites with Gentlemen of your knowing
to a Stranger of his quality I beseech you all be better
knowne to this Gentleman whom I commend to you
as a Noble Friend of mine How Worthy he is I will
leaue to appeare hereafter rather then story him in his
owne hearing

 French Sir we haue knowne togither in Orleance

 Post Since when I haue bin debtor to you for courtesies
which I will be euer to pay and yet pay still

 French Sir you orerate my poore kindnesse I was
glad I did attone my Countryman and you it had beene
pitty you should haue beene put together with so mortall
a purpose as then each bore vpon importance of so
slight and triuiall a nature

 Post By your pardon Sir I was then a young Traueller
rather shund to go euen with what I heard then in
my euery action to be guided by others experiences but
vpon my mended iudgement if I offend to say it is mended
my Quarrell was not altogether slight

 French Faith yes to be put to the arbiterment of
Swords and by such two that would by all likelyhood
haue confounded one the other or haue falne both

 Iach Can we with manners aske what was the difference
 French Safely I thinke twas a contention in publicke
which may without contradiction suffer the report
It was much like an argument that fell out last
night where each of vs fell in praise of our CountryMistresses
This Gentleman at that time vouching and
vpon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more
Faire Vertuous Wise Chaste Constant Qualified and
lesse attemptible then any the rarest of our Ladies in
Fraunce

 Iach That Lady is not now liuing or this Gentlemans
opinion by this worne out

 Post She holds her Vertue still and I my mind

 Iach You must not so farre preferre her fore ours of
Italy

 Posth Being so farre prouokd as I was in France I
would abate her nothing though I professe my selfe her
Adorer not her Friend

 Iach As faire and as good a kind of hand in hand
comparison had beene something too faire and too
good for any Lady in Britanie if she went before others
I haue seene as that Diamond of yours outlusters many
I haue beheld I could not beleeue she excelled many
but I haue not seene the most pretious Diamond that is
nor you the Lady

 Post I praisd her as I rated her so do I my Stone

 Iach What do you esteeme it at
 Post More then the world enioyes

 Iach Either your vnparagond Mistris is dead or
shes outprizd by a trifle

 Post You are mistaken the one may be solde or giuen
or if there were wealth enough for the purchases or
merite for the guift The other is not a thing for sale
and onely the guift of the Gods

 Iach Which the Gods haue giuen you
 Post Which by their Graces I will keepe

 Iach You may weare her in title yours but you
know strange Fowle light vpon neighbouring Ponds
Your Ring may be stolne too so your brace of vnprizeable
Estimations the one is but fraile and the other Casuall
A cunning Thiefe or a that way accomplishd
Courtier would hazzard the winning both of first and
last

 Post Your Italy containes none so accomplishd a
Courtier to conuince the Honour of my Mistris if in the
holding or losse of that you terme her fraile I do nothing
doubt you haue store of Theeues notwithstanding
I feare not my Ring

 Phil Let vs leaue heere Gentlemen
 Post Sir with all my heart This worthy Signior I

Make haste Who has the note of them
 Lady I Madam

 Queen Dispatch

Exit Ladies

Now Master Doctor haue you brought those drugges
 Cor Pleaseth your Highnes I here they are Madam
But I beseech your Grace without offence
My Conscience bids me aske wherefore you haue
Commanded of me these most poysonous Compounds
Which are the moouers of a languishing death
But though slow deadly

 Qu I wonder Doctor
Thou askst me such a Question Haue I not bene
Thy Pupill long Hast thou not learnd me how
To make Perfumes Distill Preserue Yea so
That our great King himselfe doth woo me oft
For my Confections Hauing thus farre proceeded
Vnlesse thou thinkst me diuellish ist not meete
That I did amplifie my iudgement in
Other Conclusions I will try the forces
Of these thy Compounds on such Creatures as
We count not worth the hanging but none humane
To try the vigour of them and apply
Allayments to their Act and by them gather
Their seuerall vertues and effects

 Cor Your Highnesse
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart
Besides the seeing these effects will be
Both noysome and infectious

 Qu O content thee
Enter Pisanio

Heere comes a flattering Rascall vpon him
Will I first worke Hees for his Master
And enemy to my Sonne How now Pisanio
Doctor your seruice for this time is ended

 Cor I do suspect you Madam
But you shall do no harme

 Qu Hearke thee a word

 Cor I do not like her She doth thinke she has
Strange lingring poysons I do know her spirit
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drugge of such damnd Nature Those she has
Will stupifie and dull the Sense awhile
Which first perchance sheel proue on Cats and Dogs
Then afterward vp higher but there is
No danger in what shew of death it makes
More then the locking vp the Spirits a time
To be more fresh reuiuing She is foold
With a most false effect and I the truer
So to be false with her

 Qu No further seruice Doctor
Vntill I send for thee

 Cor I humbly take my leaue
Enter

 Qu Weepes she still saist thou
Dost thou thinke in time
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where Folly now possesses Do thou worke
When thou shalt bring me word she loues my Sonne
Ile tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy Master Greater for
His Fortunes all lye speechlesse and his name
Is at last gaspe Returne he cannot nor
Continue where he is To shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another
And euery day that comes comes to decay
A dayes worke in him What shalt thou expect
To be depender on a thing that leanes
Who cannot be new built nor has no Friends
So much as but to prop him Thou takst vp
Thou knowst not what But take it for thy labour
It is a thing I made which hath the King
Fiue times redeemd from death I do not know
What is more Cordiall Nay I prythee take it
It is an earnest of a farther good
That I meane to thee Tell thy Mistris how
The case stands with her doot as from thy selfe
Thinke what a chance thou changest on but thinke
Thou hast thy Mistris still to boote my Sonne
Who shall take notice of thee Ile moue the King
To any shape of thy Preferment such
As thoult desire and then my selfe I cheefely
That set thee on to this desert am bound
To loade thy merit richly Call my women

Exit Pisa

Thinke on my words A slye and constant knaue
Not to be shakd the Agent for his Master
And the Remembrancer of her to hold

Of Leidgers for her Sweete and which she after
Except she bend her humor shall be assurd
To taste of too

So farre I reade aloud
But euen the very middle of my heart
Is warmd byth rest and take it thankefully
You are as welcome worthy Sir as I
Haue words to bid you and shall finde it so
In all that I can do

 Iach Thankes fairest Lady
What are men mad Hath Nature giuen them eyes
To see this vaulted Arch and the rich Crop
Of Sea and Land which can distinguish twixt
The firie Orbes aboue and the twinnd Stones
Vpon the numberd Beach and can we not
Partition make with Spectacles so pretious
Twixt faire and foule
 Imo What makes your admiration
 Iach It cannot be ith eye for Apes and Monkeys
Twixt two such Shes would chatter this way and
Contemne with mowes the other Nor ith iudgment
For Idiots in this case of fauour would
Be wisely definit Nor ith Appetite
Sluttery to such neate Excellence opposd
Should make desire vomit emptinesse
Not so allurd to feed

Both filld and running Rauening first the Lambe

 Imo When he was heere
He did incline to sadnesse and oft times
Not knowing why

 Iach I neuer saw him sad
There is a Frenchman his Companion one
An eminent Monsieur that it seemes much loues
A GallianGirle at home He furnaces
The thicke sighes from him whiles the iolly Britaine
Your Lord I meane laughes froms free lungs cries oh
Can my sides hold to think that man who knowes
By History Report or his owne proofe
What woman is yea what she cannot choose
But must be wills free houres languish
For assured bondage
 Imo Will my Lord say so
 Iach I Madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
It is a Recreation to be by
And heare him mocke the Frenchman
But Heauens know some men are much too blame

 Imo Not he I hope

 Iach Not he
But yet Heauens bounty towards him might
Be vsd more thankfully In himselfe tis much
In you which I account his beyond all Talents
Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound
To pitty too

 Imo What do you pitty Sir
 Iach Two Creatures heartyly

 Imo Am I one Sir
You looke on me what wrack discerne you in me
Deserues your pitty
 Iach Lamentable what
To hide me from the radiant Sun and solace
Ith Dungeon by a Snuffe

 Imo I pray you Sir
Deliuer with more opennesse your answeres
To my demands Why do you pitty me
 Iach That others do
I was about to say enioy your but
It is an office of the Gods to venge it
Not mine to speake ont

 Imo You do seeme to know
Something of me or what concernes me pray you
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Then to be sure they do For Certainties
Either are past remedies or timely knowing
The remedy then borne Discouer to me
What both you spur and stop

 Iach Had I this cheeke
To bathe my lips vpon this hand whose touch
Whose euery touch would force the Feelers soule
Toth oath of loyalty This obiect which
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
Fiering it onely heere should I damnd then
Slauuer with lippes as common as the stayres
That mount the Capitoll Ioyne gripes with hands
Made hard with hourely falshood falshood as
With labour then by peeping in an eye
Base and illustrious as the smoakie light
Thats fed with stinking Tallow it were fit
That all the plagues of Hell should at one time
Encounter such reuolt

 Imo My Lord I feare
Has forgot Brittaine

 Iach And himselfe not I
Inclind to this intelligence pronounce
The Beggery of his change but tis your Graces
That from my mutest Conscience to my tongue
Charmes this report out

 Imo Let me heare no more

 Iach O deerest Soule your Cause doth strike my hart
With pitty that doth make me sicke A Lady
So faire and fastend to an Emperie
Would make the greatst King double to be partnerd
With Tomboyes hyrd with that selfe exhibition
Which your owne Coffers yeeld with diseasd ventures
That play with all Infirmities for Gold
Which rottennesse can lend Nature Such boyld stuffe
As well might poyson Poyson Be reuengd
Or she that bore you was no Queene and you
Recoyle from your great Stocke

 Imo Reuengd
How should I be reuengd If this be true
As I haue such a Heart that both mine eares
Must not in haste abuse if it be true
How should I be reuengd
 Iach Should he make me
Liue like Dianas Priest betwixt cold sheets
Whiles he is vaulting variable Rampes
In your despight vpon your purse reuenge it
I dedicate my selfe to your sweet pleasure
More Noble then that runnagate to your bed
And will continue fast to your Affection
Still close as sure

 Imo What hoa Pisanio
 Iach Let me my seruice tender on your lippes

 Imo Away I do condemne mine eares that haue
So long attended thee If thou wert Honourable
Thou wouldst haue told this tale for Vertue not
For such an end thou seekst as base as strange
Thou wrongst a Gentleman who is as farre
From thy report as thou from Honor and
Solicites heere a Lady that disdaines
Thee and the Diuell alike What hoa Pisanio
The King my Father shall be made acquainted
Of thy Assault if he shall thinke it fit
A sawcy Stranger in his Court to Mart
As in a Romish Stew and to expound
His beastly minde to vs he hath a Court
He little cares for and a Daughter who
He not respects at all What hoa Pisanio
 Iach O happy Leonatus I may say
The credit that thy Lady hath of thee
Deserues thy trust and thy most perfect goodnesse
Her assurd credit Blessed liue you long
A Lady to the worthiest Sir that euer
Country calld his and you his Mistris onely
For the most worthiest fit Giue me your pardon
I haue spoke this to know if your Affiance
Were deeply rooted and shall make your Lord
That which he is new ore And he is one
The truest mannerd such a holy Witch
That he enchants Societies into him
Halfe all men hearts are his

 Imo You make amends

 Iach He sits mongst men like a defended God
He hath a kinde of Honor sets him off
More then a mortall seeming Be not angrie
Most mighty Princesse that I haue aduenturd
To try your taking of a false report which hath
Honourd with confirmation your great Iudgement
In the election of a Sir so rare
Which you know cannot erre The loue I beare him
Made me to fan you thus but the Gods made you
Vnlike all others chaffelesse Pray your pardon

 Imo Alls well Sir
Take my powre ith Court for yours

 Iach My humble thankes I had almost forgot
T intreat your Grace but in a small request
And yet of moment too for it concernes
Your Lord my selfe and other Noble Friends
Are partners in the businesse

 Imo Pray what ist
 Iach Some dozen Romanes of vs and your Lord
The best Feather of our wing haue mingled summes
To buy a Present for the Emperor
Which I the Factor for the rest haue done
In France tis Plate of rare deuice and Iewels
Of rich and exquisite forme their valewes great
And I am something curious being strange
To haue them in safe stowage May it please you
To take them in protection

 Imo Willingly
And pawne mine Honor for their safety since
My Lord hath interest in them I will keepe them
In my Bedchamber

 Iach They are in a Trunke
Attended by my men I will make bold
To send them to you onely for this night

 Imo O no no

 Iach Yes I beseech or I shall short my word
By lengthning my returne From Gallia

To see your Grace

 Imo I thanke you for your paines

Toth tender of our Present

 Cym Now say what would Augustus Caesar with vs
 Luc When Iulius Caesar whose remembrance yet
Liues in mens eyes and will to Eares and Tongues
Be Theame and hearing euer was in this Britain
And Conquerd it Cassibulan thine Vnkle
Famous in Caesars prayses no whit lesse
Then in his Feats deseruing it for him
And his Succession granted Rome a Tribute
Yeerely three thousand pounds which by thee lately
Is left vntenderd

 Qu And to kill the meruaile
Shall be so euer

 Clot There be many Caesars
Ere such another Iulius Britaines a world
By it selfe and we will nothing pay
For wearing our owne Noses

 Qu That opportunity
Which then they had to take froms to resume
We haue againe Remember Sir my Liege
The Kings your Ancestors together with
The naturall brauery of your Isle which stands
As Neptunes Parke ribbd and pald in
With Oakes vnskaleable and roaring Waters
With Sands that will not beare your Enemies Boates
But sucke them vp toth Topmast A kinde of Conquest
Caesar made heere but made not heere his bragge
Of Came and Saw and Ouercame with shame
The first that euer touchd him he was carried
From off our Coast twice beaten and his Shipping
Poore ignorant Baubles on our terrible Seas
Like Eggeshels moud vpon their Surges crackd
As easily gainst our Rockes For ioy whereof
The famd Cassibulan who was once at point
Oh giglet Fortune to master Caesars Sword
Made LudsTowne with reioycingFires bright
And Britaines strut with Courage

 Clot Come theres no more Tribute to be paid our
Kingdome is stronger then it was at that time and as I
said there is no mo such Caesars other of them may haue
crookd Noses but to owe such straite Armes none

 Cym Son let your Mother end

 Clot We haue yet many among vs can gripe as hard
as Cassibulan I doe not say I am one but I haue a hand
Why Tribute Why should we pay Tribute If Caesar
can hide the Sun from vs with a Blanket or put the Moon
in his pocket we will pay him Tribute for light else Sir
no more Tribute pray you now

 Cym You must know
Till the iniurious Romans did extort
This Tribute from vs we were free Caesars Ambition
Which swelld so much that it did almost stretch
The sides oth World against all colour heere
Did put the yoake vpons which to shake off
Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
Our selues to be we do Say then to Caesar
Our Ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Ordaind our Lawes whose vse the Sword of Caesar
Hath too much mangled whose repayre and franchise
Shall by the power we hold be our good deed
Tho Rome be therfore angry Mulmutius made our lawes
Who was the first of Britaine which did put
His browes within a golden Crowne and calld
Himselfe a King

 Luc I am sorry Cymbeline
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar
Caesar that hath moe Kings his Seruants then
Thy selfe Domesticke Officers thine Enemy
Receyue it from me then Warre and Confusion
In Caesars name pronounce I gainst thee Looke
For fury not to be resisted Thus defide
I thanke thee for my selfe

 Cym Thou art welcome Caius
Thy Caesar Knighted me my youth I spent
Much vnder him of him I gatherd Honour
Which he to seeke of me againe perforce
Behooues me keepe at vtterance I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their Liberties are now in Armes a President
Which not to reade would shew the Britaines cold
So Caesar shall not finde them

 Luc Let proofe speake

 Clot His Maiesty biddes you welcome Make pastime

in other tearmes you shall finde vs in our SaltwaterGirdle

That it is Place which lessens and sets off
And you may then reuolue what Tales I haue told you
Of Courts of Princes of the Tricks in Warre
This Seruice is not Seruice so being done
But being so allowed To apprehend thus
Drawes vs a profit from all things we see
And often to our comfort shall we finde
The shardedBeetle in a safer hold
Then is the fullwingd Eagle Oh this life

And felt them knowingly the Art oth Court

A paine that onely seemes to seeke out danger
Ith name of Fame and Honor which dyes ith search
And hath as oft a slandrous Epitaph
As Record of faire Act Nay many times
Doth ill deserue by doing well whats worse
Must curtsie at the Censure Oh Boyes this Storie
The World may reade in me My bodies markd
With Roman Swords and my report was once
First with the best of Note Cymbeline loud me

Whose boughes did bend with fruit But in one night
A Storme or Robbery call it what you will
Shooke downe my mellow hangings nay my Leaues
And left me bare to weather

 Gui Vncertaine fauour

 Bel My fault being nothing as I haue told you oft
But that two Villaines whose false Oathes preuayld
Before my perfect Honor swore to Cymbeline
I was Confederate with the Romanes so
Followed my Banishment and this twenty yeeres
This Rocke and these Demesnes haue bene my World
Where I haue liud at honest freedome payed
More pious debts to Heauen then in all

And thus I set my foote ons necke euen then
The Princely blood flowes in his Cheeke he sweats
Straines his yong Nerues and puts himselfe in posture

 Arui Nobly he yoakes
A smiling with a sigh as if the sighe
Was that it was for not being such a Smile
The Smile mocking the Sigh that it would flye
From so diuine a Temple to commix
With windes that Saylors raile at

 Gui I do note

Mingle their spurres together

 Arui Grow patient

 Bel I cannot tell Long is it since I saw him
But Time hath nothing blurrd those lines of Fauour
Which then he wore the snatches in his voice
And burst of speaking were as his I am absolute
Twas very Cloten

 Arui In this place we left them
I wish my Brother make good time with him
You say he is so fell

 Bel Being scarse made vp
I meane to man he had not apprehension
Of roaring terrors For defect of iudgement
Is oft the cause of Feare
Enter Guiderius

But see thy Brother

 Gui This Cloten was a Foole an empty purse
There was no money int Not Hercules
Could haue knockd out his Braines for he had none
Yet I not doing this the Foole had borne
My head as I do his

 Bel What hast thou done
 Gui I am perfect what cut off one Clotens head
Sonne to the Queene after his owne report
Who calld me Traitor Mountaineer and swore
With his owne single hand heeld take vs in
Displace our heads where thanks the Gods they grow
And set them on LudsTowne

 Bel We are all vndone

 Gui Why worthy Father what haue we to loose
But that he swore to take our Liues the Law
Protects not vs then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant peece of flesh threat vs
Play Iudge and Executioner all himselfe
For we do feare the Law What company
Discouer you abroad
 Bel No single soule
Can we set eye on but in all safe reason
He must haue some Attendants Though his Honor
Was nothing but mutation I and that
From one bad thing to worse Not Frenzie
Not absolute madnesse could so farre haue raud
To bring him heere alone although perhaps
It may be heard at Court that such as wee
Caue heere hunt heere are Outlawes and in time
May make some stronger head the which he hearing
As it is like him might breake out and sweare
Heeld fetch vs in yet ist not probable
To come alone either he so vndertaking
Or they so suffering then on good ground we feare
If we do feare this Body hath a taile
More perillous then the head

 Arui Let Ordnance
Come as the Gods foresay it howsoere
My Brother hath done well

 Bel I had no minde
To hunt this day The Boy Fideles sickenesse
Did make my way long forth

 Gui With his owne Sword
Which he did waue against my throat I haue tane
His head from him Ile throwt into the Creeke
Behinde our Rocke and let it to the Sea
And tell the Fishes hees the Queenes Sonne Cloten
Thats all I reake

 Bel I feare twill be reuengd
Would Polidore thou hadst not donet though valour
Becomes thee well enough

Thou hast robbd me of this deed I would Reuenges
That possible strength might meet wold seek vs through
And put vs to our answer

 Bel Well tis done
Weel hunt no more to day nor seeke for danger
Where theres no profit I prythee to our Rocke
You and Fidele play the Cookes Ile stay
Till hasty Polidore returne and bring him

Ile willingly to him to gaine his colour
Ild let a parish of such Clotens blood
And praise my selfe for charity
Enter

 Bel Oh thou Goddesse
Thou diuine Nature thou thy selfe thou blazonst
In these two Princely Boyes they are as gentle
As Zephires blowing below the Violet
Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
Their Royall blood enchafd as the rudst winde
That by the top doth take the Mountaine Pine
And make him stoope to th Vale Tis wonder
That an inuisible instinct should frame them
To Royalty vnlearnd Honor vntaught
Ciuility not seene from other valour
That wildely growes in them but yeelds a crop
As if it had beene sowd yet still its strange
What Clotens being heere to vs portends
Or what his death will bring vs
Enter Guidereus

 Gui Wheres my Brother

In Embassie to his Mother his Bodies hostage
For his returne

Hath Cadwal now to giue it motion Hearke

 Gui Is he at home
 Bel He went hence euen now

 Gui What does he meane
Since death of my deerst Mother
It did not speake before All solemne things
Should answer solemne Accidents The matter
Triumphes for nothing and lamenting Toyes
Is iollity for Apes and greefe for Boyes
Is Cadwall mad
Enter Aruiragus with Imogen dead bearing her in his Armes

 Bel Looke heere he comes
And brings the dire occasion in his Armes
Of what we blame him for

 Arui The Bird is dead
That we haue made so much on I had rather
Haue skipt from sixteene yeares of Age to sixty
To haue turnd my leaping time into a Crutch
Then haue seene this

 Gui Oh sweetest fayrest Lilly
My Brother weares thee not the one halfe so well
As when thou grewst thy selfe

 Bel Oh Melancholly
Who euer yet could sound thy bottome Finde
The Ooze to shew what Coast thy sluggish care
Mightst easilest harbour in Thou blessed thing
Ioue knowes what man thou mightst haue made but I
Thou dyedst a most rare Boy of Melancholly
How found you him
 Arui Starke as you see
Thus smiling as some Fly had tickled slumber
Not as deaths dart being laughd at his right Cheeke
Reposing on a Cushion

 Gui Where
 Arui Oth floore
His armes thus leagud I thought he slept and put
My clowted Brogues from off my feete whose rudenesse
Answerd my steps too lowd

 Gui Why he but sleepes
If he be gone heel make his Graue a Bed
With female Fayries will his Tombe be haunted
And Wormes will not come to thee

 Arui With fayrest Flowers
Whilst Sommer lasts and I liue heere Fidele
Ile sweeten thy sad graue thou shalt not lacke
The Flower thats like thy face PalePrimrose nor
The azurd HareBell like thy Veines no nor
The leafe of Eglantine whom not to slander
Outsweetned not thy breath the Raddocke would
With Charitable bill Oh bill sore shaming
Those richleftheyres that let their Fathers lye
Without a Monument bring thee all this
Yea and furrd Mosse besides When Flowres are none
To winterground thy Coarse
 Gui Prythee haue done
And do not play in Wenchlike words with that
Which is so serious Let vs bury him
And not protract with admiration what
Is now due debt Toth graue

 Arui Say where shalls lay him
 Gui By good Euriphile our Mother

 Arui Beet so
And let vs Polidore though now our voyces
Haue got the mannish cracke sing him toth ground
As once to our Mother vse like note and words
Saue that Euriphile must be Fidele

 Gui Cadwall
I cannot sing Ile weepe and word it with thee
For Notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Then Priests and Phanes that lye

 Arui Weel speake it then

 Bel Great greefes I see medcine the lesse For Cloten
Is quite forgot He was a Queenes Sonne Boyes
And though he came our Enemy remember
He was paid for that though meane and mighty rotting
Together haue one dust yet Reuerence
That Angell of the world doth make distinction
Of place tweene high and low Our Foe was Princely
And though you tooke his life as being our Foe
Yet bury him as a Prince

 Gui Pray you fetch him hither
Thersites body is as good as Aiax
When neyther are aliue

 Arui If youl go fetch him

These Flowres are like the pleasures of the World
This bloody man the care ont I hope I dreame
For so I thought I was a Cauekeeper

Twas but a bolt of nothing shot of nothing
Which the Braine makes of Fumes Our very eyes
Are sometimes like our Iudgements blinde Good faith
I tremble still with feare but if there be
Yet left in Heauen as small a drop of pittie
As a Wrens eye feard Gods a part of it
The Dreames heere still euen when I wake it is
Without me as within me not imagind felt
A headlesse man The Garments of Posthumus
I know the shape ofs Legge this is his Hand
His Foote Mercuriall his martiall Thigh
The brawnes of Hercules but his Iouiall face
Murther in heauen How tis gone Pisanio
All Curses madded Hecuba gaue the Greekes
And mine to boot be darted on thee thou
Conspird with that Irregulous diuell Cloten
Hath heere cut off my Lord To write and read

 Cym How me

Which torments me to conceale By Villany
I got this Ring twas Leonatus Iewell
Whom thou didst banish and which more may greeue thee

Twixt sky and ground Wilt thou heare more my Lord
 Cym All that belongs to this

 Iach That Paragon thy daughter
For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
Quaile to remember Giue me leaue I faint

 Iach Vpon a time vnhappy was the clocke
That strooke the houre it was in Rome accurst
The Mansion where twas at a Feast oh would
Our Viands had bin poysond or at least
Those which I heaud to head the good Posthumus
What should I say he was too good to be
Where ill men were and was the best of all
Amongst the rarst of good ones sitting sadly
Hearing vs praise our Loues of Italy
For Beauty that made barren the swelld boast
Of him that best could speake for Feature laming
The Shrine of Venus or straightpight Minerua
Postures beyond breefe Nature For Condition
A shop of all the qualities that man
Loues woman for besides that hooke of Wiuing
Fairenesse which strikes the eye

 Cym I stand on fire Come to the matter

 Iach All too soone I shall
Vnlesse thou wouldst greeue quickly This Posthumus
Most like a Noble Lord in loue and one
That had a Royall Louer tooke his hint
And not dispraising whom we praisd therein
He was as calme as vertue he began
His Mistris picture which by his tongue being made
And then a minde put int either our bragges
Were crakd of KitchinTrulles or his description
Proud vs vnspeaking sottes

 Cym Nay nay toth purpose

 Iach Your daughters Chastity there it beginnes
He spake of her as Dian had hot dreames
And she alone were cold Whereat I wretch
Made scruple of his praise and wagerd with him
Peeces of Gold gainst this which then he wore
Vpon his honourd finger to attaine
In suite the place ofs bed and winne this Ring
By hers and mine Adultery he true Knight
No lesser of her Honour confident
Then I did truly finde her stakes this Ring
And would so had it beene a Carbuncle
Of Phoebus Wheele and might so safely had it
Bin all the worth ofs Carre Away to Britaine
Poste I in this designe Well may you Sir
Remember me at Court where I was taught
Of your chaste Daughter the wide difference
Twixt Amorous and Villanous Being thus quenchd
Of hope not longing mine Italian braine
Gan in your duller Britaine operate
Most vildely for my vantage excellent
And to be breefe my practise so preuayld
That I returnd with simular proofe enough
To make the Noble Leonatus mad
By wounding his beleefe in her Renowne
With Tokens thus and thus auerring notes
Of Chamberhanging Pictures this her Bracelet
Oh cunning how I got nay some markes
Of secret on her person that he could not
But thinke her bond of Chastity quite crackd
I hauing tane the forfeyt Whereupon
Me thinkes I see him now

 Post I so thou dost
Italian Fiend Aye me most credulous Foole
Egregious murtherer Theefe any thing
Thats due to all the Villaines past in being
To come Oh giue me Cord or knife or poyson
Some vpright Iusticer Thou King send out
For Torturors ingenious it is I
That all th abhorred things oth earth amend
By being worse then they I am Posthumus
That killd thy Daughter Villainlike I lye
That causd a lesser villaine then my selfe
A sacrilegious Theefe to doot The Temple
Of Vertue was she yea and she her selfe
Spit and throw stones cast myre vpon me set
The dogges oth street to bay me euery villaine

Which I gaue him for Cordiall she is serud

 Cym Whats this Cornelius
 Corn The Queene Sir very oft importund me
To temper poysons for her still pretending
The satisfaction of her knowledge onely
In killing Creatures vilde as Cats and Dogges
Of no esteeme I dreading that her purpose

A certaine stuffe which being tane would cease
The present powre of life but in short time
All Offices of Nature should againe
Do their due Functions Haue you tane of it

Thinke that you are vpon a Rocke and now

That we meet heere so strangely but her Sonne

 Pisa My Lord
Now feare is from me Ile speake troth Lord Cloten
Vpon my Ladies missing came to me
With his Sword drawne foamd at the mouth and swore
If I discouerd not which way she was gone
It was my instant death By accident
I had a feigned Letter of my Masters
Then in my pocket which directed him
To seeke her on the Mountaines neere to Milford
Where in a frenzie in my Masters Garments
Which he inforcd from me away he postes
With vnchaste purpose and with oath to violate
My Ladies honor what became of him
I further know not

 Gui Let me end the Story I slew him there

 Cym Marry the Gods forefend
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Plucke a hard sentence Prythee valiant youth
Denyt againe

 Gui I haue spoke it and I did it

 Cym He was a Prince

 Gui A most inciuill one The wrongs he did mee
Were nothing Princelike for he did prouoke me
With Language that would make me spurne the Sea
If it could so roare to me I cut offs head
And am right glad he is not standing heere
To tell this tale of mine

 Cym I am sorrow for thee
By thine owne tongue thou art condemnd and must
Endure our Law Thourt dead

 Imo That headlesse man I thought had bin my Lord
 Cym Binde the Offender
And take him from our presence

 Bel Stay Sir King
This man is better then the man he slew
As well descended as thy selfe and hath
More of thee merited then a Band of Clotens
Had euer scarre for Let his Armes alone
They were not borne for bondage

 Cym Why old Soldier
Wilt thou vndoo the worth thou art vnpayd for
By tasting of our wrath How of descent
As good as we

And let it be confiscate all so soone
As I haue receyud it

 Cym Nursing of my Sonnes
 Bel I am too blunt and sawcy heeres my knee
Ere I arise I will preferre my Sonnes
Then spare not the old Father Mighty Sir
These two young Gentlemen that call me Father
And thinke they are my Sonnes are none of mine
They are the yssue of your Loynes my Liege
And blood of your begetting

 Cym How my Issue

 Bel So sure as you your Fathers I old Morgan
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banishd
Your pleasure was my neere offence my punishment
It selfe and all my Treason that I sufferd
Was all the harme I did These gentle Princes
For such and so they are these twenty yeares
Haue I traind vp those Arts they haue as I
Could put into them My breeding was Sir
As your Highnesse knowes Their Nurse Euriphile
Whom for the Theft I wedded stole these Children
Vpon my Banishment I mooud her toot
Hauing receyud the punishment before
For that which I did then Beaten for Loyaltie
Excited me to Treason Their deere losse
The more of you twas felt the more it shapd
Vnto my end of stealing them But gracious Sir
Heere are your Sonnes againe and I must loose
Two of the sweetst Companions in the World
The benediction of these couering Heauens
Fall on their heads like dew for they are worthie
To inlay Heauen with Starres

 Cym Thou weepst and speakst
The Seruice that you three haue done is more
Vnlike then this thou tellst I lost my Children
If these be they I know not how to wish
A payre of worthier Sonnes

Most worthy Prince as yours is true Guiderius

In a most curious Mantle wrought by th hand
Of his Queene Mother which for more probation
I can with ease produce

Hath to it Circumstantiall branches which
Distinction should be rich in Where how liud you
And when came you to serue our Romane Captiue
How parted with your Brother How first met them
Why fled you from the Court And whether these
And your three motiues to the Battaile with
I know not how much more should be demanded
And all the other bydependances
From chance to chance But nor the Time nor Place

And she like harmlesse Lightning throwes her eye
On him her Brothers Me her Master hitting
Each obiect with a Ioy the Counterchange

Is so from sense in hardnesse that I can
Make no Collection of it Let him shew
His skill in the construction

 Sooth Heere my good Lord

 Luc Read and declare the meaning

Reades

When as a Lyons whelpe shall to himselfe vnknown without
seeking finde and bee embracd by a peece of tender
Ayre And when from a stately Cedar shall be lopt branches
which being dead many yeares shall after reuiue bee ioynted to
the old Stocke and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his
miseries Britaine be fortunate and flourish in Peace and Plentie
Thou Leonatus art the Lyons Whelpe
The fit and apt Construction of thy name
Being Leonatus doth import so much
The peece of tender Ayre thy vertuous Daughter
Which we call Mollis Aer and Mollis Aer
We terme it Mulier which Mulier I diuine
Is this most constant Wife who euen now
Answering the Letter of the Oracle
Vnknowne to you vnsought were clipt about
With this most tender Aire

 Cym This hath some seeming

 Sooth The lofty Cedar Royall Cymbeline
Personates thee And thy lopt Branches point
Thy two Sonnes forth who by Belarius stolne
For many yeares thought dead are now reuiud
To the Maiesticke Cedar ioynd whose Issue
Promises Britaine Peace and Plenty

 Cym Well
My Peace we will begin And Caius Lucius
Although the Victor we submit to Caesar
And to the Romane Empire promising
To pay our wonted Tribute from the which
We were disswaded by our wicked Queene
Whom heauens in Iustice both on her and hers
Haue laid most heauy hand

 Sooth The fingers of the Powres aboue do tune
The harmony of this Peace the Vision
Which I made knowne to Lucius ere the stroke
Of yet this scarsecoldBattaile at this instant
Is full accomplishd For the Romaine Eagle
From South to West on wing soaring aloft
Lessend her selfe and in the Beames oth Sun
So vanishd which foreshewd our Princely Eagle
Th Imperiall Caesar should againe vnite
His Fauour with the Radiant Cymbeline
Which shines heere in the West

 Cym Laud we the Gods
And let our crooked Smoakes climbe to their Nostrils
From our blest Altars Publish we this Peace
To all our Subiects Set we forward Let
A Roman and a Brittish Ensigne waue
Friendly together so through LudsTowne march
And in the Temple of great Iupiter
Our Peace weel ratifie Seale it with Feasts
Set on there Neuer was a Warre did cease
Ere bloodie hands were washd with such a Peace

Exeunt
