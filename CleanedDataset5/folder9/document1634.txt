CHAPTER I A FRIENDLY WARNING

Mary Adams youre a fool

The single dimple in a smooth red cheek smiled in answer

Youre repeating yourself Jane

You wont give him one hours time for just three sittings

Not a second for one sitting

Hopeless

Mary smiled provokingly her white teeth gleaming in obstinate good
humor

Hes the most distinguished artist in America

Ive heard so

It would be a liberal education for a girl of your training to know
such a man

Ill omit that course of instruction

The younger woman was silent a moment and a flush of anger slowly
mounted her temples The blue eyes were fixed reproachfully on her
friend

You really thought that I would pose

I hoped so

Alone with a man in his studio for hours

Jane Anderson lifted her dark brows

Why no I hardly expected that Im sure he would take his easel and
palette out into the square in front of the Plaza Hotel and let you sit
on the base of the Sherman monument The crowds would cheer and inspire
himbah Cant you have a little commonsense There are a few
brutes among artists as there are in all professionseven among the
superintendents of your schools Gordons a great creative genius If
youd try to flirt with him hed stop his work and send you home Youd
be as safe in his studio as in your mothers nursery Ive known him
for ten years Hes the gentlest truest man Ive ever met Hes doing a
canvas on which he has set his whole heart

He can get professional models

For his usual work yesbut this is the head of the Madonna He saw
you walking with me in the Park last week and has been to my studio a
halfdozen times begging me to take you to see him Please Mary dear
do this for my sake I owe Gordon a debt I can never pay He gave me
the cue to the work that set me on my feet He was big and generous
and helpful when I needed a friend He asked nothing in return but the
privilege of helping me again if I ever needed it You can do me an
enormous favorplease

Mary Adams rose with a gesture of impatience walked to her window and
gazed on the torrent of humanity pouring through Twentythird Street
from the beehives of industry that have changed this quarter of New York
so rapidly in the last five years She turned suddenly and confronted
her friend

How could you think that I would stoop to such a thing

Stoop

Yes she snapped pose for an artist Id as soon think of rushing
stark naked through Twentythird Street at noon

The older woman looked at her flushed face suppressed a sharp answer
broke into a fit of laughter and threw her arms around Marys neck

Honey youre such a hopeless little fool youre delicious You know
that I love youdont you

The pretty lips quivered

Yes

Could I possibly ask you to do a thing that would harm a single brown
hair of your head

The firm hand of the older girl touched a rebellious lock with
tenderness

Of course not from your point of view Jane dear the stubborn lips
persisted But you see its not my point of view Youre older than
I

Jane smiled

Hoity toity Miss Im just twentyeight and youre twentyfour Age is
not measured by calendars these days

I didnt mean that the girl apologized But youre an artist Youre
established and distinguished You belong to a different world

Jane Anderson laid her hand softly on her friends

Thats just it dear I do belong to a different worlda big new world
of whose existence you are not quite conscious You are living in the
old old world in which women have groped for thousands of years I
dont mind confessing that I undertook this job of getting you to pose
for Gordon for a double purpose I wished to do something to repay
the debt I owe himbut I wished far more to be of help to you Youre
living in the Dark Ages and its a dangerous thing for a pretty girl to
live in the Dark Ages and date her letters from New York today

I dont understand you in the least

And Im afraid you never will

She paused suddenly and changed her tone

Tell me now are you happy in your work

Im earning sixty dollars a monthmy position is secure

But are you happy in it

I dont expect to teach school all my life was the vague answer

Exactly You loathe the sight of a schoolroom You do the task they
set you because your fathers a clergyman and cant support his
big family Youre waiting and longing for the day of your
deliveranceisnt it so

Perhaps

And that day of deliverance

Will come when I meet my Fate

Youll meet him too

I will

Jane Anderson shook her fine head

And may the Lord have mercy on your poor little soul when you do

And why pray

Because youre the most helpless and defenseless of all the things He
created

Mary smiled

Ive managed to take pretty good care of myself so far

And you willuntil the thunderbolt falls

The thunderbolt

Until you meet your Fate

Ill have someone to look after me then

Well hope so anyhow was the quick retort

But cant you see Jane dear that we look at life from such utterly
different angles You glory in your work Its your inspirationthe
breath you breathe I dont believe in women working for money I dont
believe God ever meant us to work when He made us women He made
us women for something more wonderful I dont see anything good or
glorious in the fact that half the torrent of humanity you see down
there pouring through the street from those factories and offices is
made up of women They are wageearnersso much the worse They are
forcing the scale of wages for men lower and lower They are paying for
it in weakened bodies and sickly hopeless children We should not shout
for joy we should cry God never meant for woman to be a wageearner

A sob caught her voice and she paused

The artist watched her emotion with keen interest

Neither do I believe that God means to force woman at last to do the
tasks of man But shes doing them dearand it must be so until a
brighter day dawns for humanity The new world that opens before us
will never abolish marriage but it has opened our eyes to know what it
means You refuse to open yours You refuse to see this new world about
you Ive begged you to join one of my clubs You refuse I beg you to
meet and know such men of genius as Gordon

As an artists model

Its the only way on earth you can meet him You stick to your narrow
hidebound conventional life and dream of the Knight who will suddenly
appear some day out of the mists and clouds You dream of the Fate God
has prepared for you in His mysterious Providence Its funny how that
idea persists even today in novels As a matter of fact we know that the
oldfashioned girl met her Fate because her shrewd mother planned the
meetingplanned it with cunning and stratagem Youre alone in a great
modern city with all the conditions of the life of the old regime
reversed or blotted out Your mother is not here And if she were her
schemes to bring about the mysterious meeting of the Fates would be
impossible You outgrew the limits of your village life Your highly
trained mind landed you in New York Youve fought your way to a
competent living in five years and kept yourself clean and unspotted
from the world Granted But how many men have you met who are your
equals in culture and character

Jane paused and held Marys gaze with steady persistence

How manyhonest

None as yet she confessed

But you live in the one fond imperishable hope Its the only
thing that keeps you alive and goingthis idea of your Fate Its an
obsessionthis mysterious Knight somewhere in the future riding to meet
you

Ill find him never fear the girl laughed

Of course you will Youll make him out of whole cloth if its
necessary Our ideals are really the same when you come to analyze my
wider outlook

The artist paused and laughed softly

The same the girl asked incredulously

Certainly Mine is based on intelligence howeveryours on blind
instinct perverted and twisted by the idiotic fiction you read morning
noon and night

I dont see it Mary answered emphatically Your ideal is fame
achievement the applause of the worldmine just a home and a baby

Jane laughed softly

And thats all you know about me

Isnt it true

Youve been in this room five years havent you the older girl asked
musingly

Yes

And though youve kept your lamp trimmed and burning you havent yet
seen a man whom you could recognize as your equal

Im only twentyfour

In these five years Ive met a hundred men my equal

And smashed the conventions of Society whenever you saw fit

Without breaking a single law of reason or commonsense In the
meantime Ive met two men who have really made love to me I thought I
loved one of themuntil I met the other The second proved himself to
be an unprincipled scoundrel If I had held your views of life and hated
my work I would have married this man and lived to awake in a prison
whose only door was Death But I loved my work Life meant more than
one man who was not worth an hours tears I turned to my studio and he
slipped back into the gutter where he belonged Ill meet MY Fate
some day too dear Im waiting and watchingbut with clear eyes
and unafraid Ill know mine when he comes I shall not be blinded by
passion or the fear of drudgery Cant you see this bigger world of
realities

The dimple flashed again in the smooth red cheek

Its not for me Jane Im just a modest little home body Ill bide my
time

And eat your foolish heart out here between the narrow walls of this
cell youve built for yourself I should think youd die living here
alone

The girl flushed

Im not lonely

Dont fib I know better Your birds and kitten occupy daily about
thirty minutes of the time thats your own What do you do with the rest
of it

Sit by my window watch the crowds stream through the streets below
read and dream and think

Yesread love stories and dream about your Knight

Well

Its morbid and unhealthy Youve hedged yourself about with the old
conventions and imagine youre safeand you areuntil you meet HIM

Ill know how to behavenever fear

You mean youll know how instantly to blindfold halter and lead him to
the Little Church Around the Corner

Mary moved uneasily

And what else should I do with him

Compare him with other men Weigh him in the balances of a remorseless
commonsense Study him under a microscope and keep your reason clear
The girl who rushes into marriage in a great city under the conditions
in which you and I live is a fool More girls are ruined in New York
by marriage than by any other process The thunderbolt out of the blue
hasnt struck you yet but when it does

Ill tell you Jane

Will you honestly

The question was asked with wistful tenderness

I promise And you mustnt think I dont appreciate this visit and the
chance youve given again to enter the big world youre always telling
me about I just cant do it dear Its not my world

All right my little foolish virgin have it your own way When youre
lonely run up to my studio to see me I wont ask you to pose or meet
any of the dangerous men of my circle Well lock the doors and have a
snug time all by ourselves

Ill remember

The clock in the Metropolitan Tower chimed the hour of five and Jane
Anderson rose with a quick businesslike movement

Dont hurry Mary protested I know Ive been stubborn but Ive
been so happy in your coming I do get lonelyfrightfully lonely
sometimesdont think Im ungrateful

Youre dangerously beautiful child the artist said with enthusiasm
And remember that I love youno matter how silly you aregoodby

You wont stay for a cup of tea I meant to ask you an hour ago

No Ive an engagement with a dreadful man whom Ive no idea of ever
marrying Im going to dinner with himjust to study the animal at dose
range

With a jolly laugh and quick firm step she was gone

Mary snatched the kitten from his snug bed between the pillows of the
windowseat and pressed his fuzzy head under her chin

She tempted us terribly Kitty darling but we didnt let her find
outdid we You know deep down in your cats soul that I was just dying
to meet the distinguished Gordonbut such high honors are not for home
bodies like you and me

She dropped on the seat and closed her eyes for a long time The kitten
watched her wonderingly sure of a sudden outbreak with each passing
moment Two soft paws at last touched her cheeks and two bright eyes
sought in vain for hers The little nose pressed closer and kissed the
drooping eyelids until they opened He curled himself on her bosom and
began to sing a gentle lullaby For a long while she lay and listened to
the music of love with which her pet sought to soothe the ache within

The clock in the tower chimed six

She lifted her body and placed her head on a pillow beside the window
The human torrent below was now at its flood Two streams of humanity
flowed eastward along each broad sidewalk Hundreds were pouring in
endless procession across Madison Square The cars in Broadway north and
South were jammed Every day she watched this crowd hurrying hurrying
away into the twilightand among all its hundreds of thousands not
an eye was ever lifted to hersnot one man or woman among them cared
whether she lived or died

It was horrible this loneliness of the desert in an ocean of humanity
For the past year it had become an increasing horror to look into the
silent faces of this crowd of men and women and never feel the touch of
a friendly hand or hear the sound of a human voice in greeting

And yet this endless procession held for her a supreme fascination
Somewhere among its myriads of tramping feet walked the one man created
for her She no more doubted this than she doubted God Himself It was
His law He had ordained it so She had grown so used to the throngs
below her window and so loved the little park with its splashing
fountain that she had refused to follow her landlady uptown when the
brownstone boardinghouse facing the Square had been turned into a
studio building

Instead of moving she had wheedled the landlord into allowing her to
cut off a small space from her room for a private bath and kitchenette
built a box couch across the window large enough for a threequarter
mattress and covered it with velour For five dollars a week she
had thus secured a little home in which was combined a sittingroom
bedroom bath and kitchenette

It had its drawbacks of course The Professor downstairs who taught
music sometimes gave a special lesson at night and the Italian sculptor
who worked on the top floor used a hammer at the most impossible hours
But on the whole she liked it better than the tiresome routine of
boarding She was not afraid at night The stampandcoin man who
occupied the first floor lived with his wife and baby in the rear The
janitress had a room on the floor above hers Two elderly women workers
of ability in the mechanical arts occupied the rear of her floor and
a dear little fat woman of fifty who drew designs for the New England
weavers of cotton goods lived in the room adjoining hers

She had never spoken to any of these people but Ella the janitress
who cleaned up her place every morning had told her their history
Ella was a sociable soul her face an eternal study and an inscrutable
mystery She spoke both German and English and yet never a word of her
own lifes history passed her lips She had loved Mary from the moment
she cocked her queer drawn face to one side and looked at her with the
one good eye she possessed She was always doing little things for her
comfortand never asked tips for it If Mary offered to pay she smiled
quietly and spoke in the softest drawl Oh thats nothing childAch
Gott im Himmelnein

This oneeyed homely woman who cleaned up her room for three dollars
a month and Jane Anderson were the only friends she had among the six
million people whose lives centered on Manhattan Island

Man had yet to darken her door The little room had been carefully
fitted however to receive her Knight when the great event of his
coming should be at hand

The box couch was built of hard wood paneling and was covered with
pillows of soft leather and silk The bedclothes were carefully stored
in the locker beneath the mattress cushion No one would ever suspect
its use as a bed The bathroom was fitted with a bureau and no signs of
a sleeping apartment disfigured the effect of her one library parlor
and receptionroom A desk and bookcase stood at either end of the box
couch The bookcase was filled with fictionlove stories exclusively

A large birdcage swung from a staple in the window and two canaries
peered cautiously from their perches at the kitten in her lap She had
trained him to ignore this cage

The crowds below were thinning down A light snow was falling The girl
lifted her pet and kissed his cold nose

We must get our own dinner tonight Mr Thomascatits snowing
outside And did you hear what she said Kitty dearMore girls are
ruined by marriage in New York than by any other process A good joke
KittyYou and I know better than that if we do live in our own tiny
world Well risk it some day anyhow wont we

The kitten purred his assent and Mary bustled over the little gas stove
humming an old love song her mother had taught her in a faroff village
in Kentucky




CHAPTER II TEMPTATION


Her kitchenette was a model of order and cleanliness The carpenter
who built its neat cupboard and fitted the drawers beneath the tiny
gas range had outdone himself in its construction He had given the
woodwork four coats of immaculate white paint without extra charge
Mary had insisted on paying for it but he waved the proffered money
aside with a gesture that spoke louder than words

Pooh Thats nothing to what Id like to do for you

She was not surprised when he called the following Saturday and stood
at her door awkwardly fumbling his hat trying to ask her to spend the
afternoon and evening at Coney Island with him There was no mistaking
the manner in which he made this request

She had refused him as gently as possiblea big awkward goodnatured
ignorant boy he was with the eyes of a St Bernard dog He apologized
for his presumption and never repeated the offense

Somehow her conquests had all been in this class

The tall blushing German youth from the butchers around the corner
had been slipping extra cuts into her bundle and making awkward advances
until she caught him redhanded with a pound of lamb chops which he
failed to explain She read him a lecture on honesty that discouraged
him It was not so much what she said as the way she said it that
wounded his sensitive nature

The ice man she had not yet entirely subdued Tony Bonelli had the
advantage of pretending not to understand her orders of dismissal He
merely smiled in his sad Italian way and continued to pack her icebox
so full the lid would never close

She was reminded at every turn tonight of these futile conquests of the
impossible They all smelled of the back stairs and the kitchen Her
people had been slaveholders in the old regime of southern Kentucky A
kindly tolerant contempt for the pretensions of a servant class was bred
in the bone of her being

And yet their tribute to her beauty had its compensations It was the
promise of triumph when he for whom she waited should step from the
throng and lift his hat Just how he was going to do this without a
breach of the proprieties of life she couldnt see It would come It
must come It was Fate

In twenty minutes her coffeepot was boiling the lamb chops broiled to
perfection and she was seated before the dainty snowwhite table the
kitten softly begging at her feet Half an hour later every dish and
pot and pan was back in its place in perfect order She prided herself
on her mastery of the details of cooking and the most economical
administration of every dollar devoted to housekeeping She studied
cooking in the best schools the city afforded She meant to show her
Knight a thing or two in this line when the time came His wife would
not be an ignorant slattern the victim of incompetent servants No
servant could fool her She would know the business of the house down to
its minutest detail

Not that she loved dishwashing and potpolishing and scrubbing It was
simply a part of the Game of Life she must play in the ideal home she
would build There was no drudgery in it for this reason She was a
soldier on the drill grounds preparing for the battle on the successful
issue of which hung her happiness and the happiness of the one of
whom she dreamed She might miss some of the dangerous fun which Jane
Anderson could enjoy without a scratch but she would make sure of the
fundamental things which Jane would never stop to consider

She threw herself on the couch in her favorite position against the
pillows drew the kitten into her arms and hugged him violently

Its all right Mr Thomascat well show them she purred softly
Well see who wins at last the eagle who soars or the little wren in
the hedge close beside the garden wallwell see Kittywell see

The room was still the noise of the streetcars below muffled with the
first soft blanket of snow The street lamps flickered in the wind with
a pale subdued light that scarcely brought out the furnishings of her
nest She was in the habit of dreaming in this window for hours with
only the light from the lamps on the street

The Square deserted by its tramp lovers lay white and still and cold
The old battle with the Blue Devils was on again within The fight with
Jane had been easy She had always found it easy to face temptation in
the concrete The moment Satan appeared in human shape she was up in
arms and ready for the fray It was this silent hour she dreaded when
the defenses of the soul were down

There was no use to lie to herself She was utterly lonely and
heartsick

She had guarded the portals of life with religious carewith a care
altogether unnecessary as events had proved There had been no crush of
rude men to assault her Only an awkward carpenter a butchers boy
and the ice man It was incredible Of all the men whose restless
feet pressed the pavements of New York not one save these three had
apparently cared whether she lived or died

The men whom she met in her duties in the schoolroom she had found
utterly devoid of imagination and beneath contempt They had each
been obviously on guard against the machinations of the female of the
species They had each of them shown plainly their fear and hatred of
women teachers The feeling was mutual God knows she had no desire to
encroach on their domain any longer than absolutely necessary

Perhaps she was making a mistake The thought was strangling Only the
girl who waived conventions in the rushing tide of the modern citys
life seemed to live at all The others merely existed Jane Anderson
lived There could be no mistake about that She had mastered the ugly
mob Its cruel loneliness was to her a thing unknown But Jane was an
exceptionthe one woman in a thousand who could defy conventions and
yet keep her soul and body clean

The offer she had made had proved a terrible temptation The artist who
had asked with such eagerness to use her head for his portrait of the
Madonna on the canvas he was executing for the new cathedral had long
appealed to her vivid imagination Two prints of his famous work hung on
her walls She had always wished to know him He had married a Southern
girl

That was just the pointhe WAS married

No girl could afford to be shut up alone in a studio with a fascinating
married man for three hoursor half an hour What if she should fall
in love with him at first sight Such things had happened They could
happen again Only tragedy could be the end of such an event It was too
dangerous to consider for a moment

She would have consented had it been possible for Jane to chaperon
her That would have been obviously ridiculous No artist with any
selfrespect would tolerate such a reflection on his honesty No girl
could afford to confess her fears in this brazen fashion

The necessity for her refusal had depressed her beyond any experience
she had passed through in the dreary desert of the past five years

She lifted the sleeping kitten and whispered passionately

Am I a silly fool Kitty Am I

The tears came at last She lay back on the pillows and let them pour
down her cheeks without protest or effort at selfcontrol Every nerve
of her strong healthy body ached for the love and companionship of men
which she had denied herself with an iron will At nineteen it had been
easy The sheer animal joy in life had been enough With the growth of
each year the ache within had become more and more insistent With each
ripening season of body and mind the hunger of love had grown more
and more maddening How long could she keep up this battle with every
instinct of her being

She rose at last determined to go to Jane confess that she had been
a fool and step out into the new world New Yorks world and begin to
live

She seized her hat and furs and put them on with feverish haste

God knows its time I beganIll be an old maid in another year and
dry upugh

She looked in the quaint oval mirror that hung beside her door and
lifted her head with a touch of pride

She had reached the street and started for the Broadway car before she
suddenly remembered that Jane was dining with a dangerous man

She couldnt turn back to that little room tonight without new courage
Her decision was instantaneous She couldnt surrender to the flesh and
the devil by yielding to Jane

She would go to prayermeeting

Religion had always been a very real thing in her life Her father was a
Methodist presiding elder She would have gone to the meeting tonight
in the first place but for the snow Dr Craddock the new sensational
pastor of the Temple was giving a series of Wednesdaynight talks that
had aroused wide interest and drawn immense crowds

His theme tonight was one that promised all sorts of sensationsThe
Woman of the Future The only trouble with the Doctor was that the
substance of his discourses sometimes failed to make good the startling
suggestions of his titles No mattershe would go She felt a sense of
righteous pride infighting her way to the church through the first storm
of the winter

In spite of the snow the church was crowded The subject announced had
evidently touched a vital spot in modern life More people were thinking
about The Woman of the Future than she had suspected The crowd sat
with eager upturned faces

The first halfhours prayer and song service had just begun
Mary joined in the singing of the stirring evangelistic hymns with
enthusiasm Something in their battlecry melody caught her spirit
instantly tonight and her whole being responded In ten minutes she was
a good shouting Methodist and supremely happy without knowing why She
never paused to ask Her nature was profoundly religious and she had
been born and bred in the atmosphere of revivals Her father was an
aggressive evangelist both in his character and methods of work and she
was his own daughtera child of emotion

The individuals in the eager crowd which packed the popular church meant
nothing to her personally They had passed before her unseeing eyes
Sunday after Sunday the past five years as mere shadows of an unknown
world which swallowed them up the moment they reached the street She
had never seen the inside of one of their homes Not one of them had
drawn close enough to her to venture an invitation

Two of the stewards she knew personallyone a bricklayer the other a
baker on Eighth Avenue The preacher she had met in a purely formal way
as the bishop of the flock She liked Dr Craddock He was known in the
ministry as a live wire He was a man of vigorous physiquejust turning
fifty magnetic eloquent and popular with the masses

Mary was curious tonight as to what the preacher would say on The Woman
of the Future The Methodist Church had been a pioneer in the modern
Feminist movement having long ago admitted women to the full ordination
of the ministry Craddock however had been known for his conservatism
in the woman movement He abhorred the idea of womans suffrage as a
dangerous revolution and the fact that he consented to treat the topic
at all was a reluctant confession of its menacing importance

With keen interest the girl saw him rise at last A breathless hush
fell on the crowd He walked deliberately to the edge of the platform
and gazed into the faces of the people

I have often been asked he slowly began where I get my sermons He
paused and laughed Ill be perfectly honest with you Sometimes I get
them from the Biblesometimes from the book of life The genesis of
this talk tonight is very definite I found it in the liquid depths of
a little girls eyes She asked a simple question that set me
thinkingnot only about the subject of her query but on the vaster
issues that grew out of it She looked up into my face the other night
after my call for volunteers for the new mission we are beginning in the
slums of the East Side and asked me if the girls were not going to be
given the chance to do something worth while in this churchs work

I couldnt honestly answer her offhand and in my groping I forgot the
child and her question I saw a visiona vision of that broader nobler
future toward which human civilization is now swiftly moving

I say deliberately that it is swiftly moving because the progress of
the world during the last fifty years has been greater than in any five
hundred years of the past

The older I grow the stronger becomes my conviction that the problems
of the age in which we now live cannot be solved by masculine brain
and brawn alone The problems of the city and the nation and the great
fundamental social questions that involve the foundations of modern life
will find no solution until the heart and brain of woman are poured into
the crucible of our test

They talk about a womans sphere As though it had a limit Theres not
a place in earth or heaven Theres not a task to mankind given Theres
not a blessing or a woe Theres not a whisper yes or no Theres not a
life or death or birth That has a feathers weight of worth Without a
woman in it

The difference between a man and a woman is one that makes them
the complementary parts of a perfect unit God made man in His own
imagemale and female The person of God therefore combines these two
elements unseparated The mind of God is both male and female In man we
have the strength which lifts and tugs and fights the elements This is
the aspect turned primarily toward matter In woman we have the finer
qualities of the Spirit turned toward the source of all spirit in God
The idea of a masculine deity is a false assumption of the Dark Ages
God is both male and female

I used to wonder why Jesus Christ was a man until I realized that
the Incarnation expressed the depth of human need God stooped lower
in assuming the form of man The form of the divine revelation through
Jesus Christ was determined solely by this depth of human need

For half an hour in impetuous eloquence in telling incidents wet with
tears and winged with hope he held his listeners in a spell It was not
until the burst of applause which greeted his closing sentence had died
away that Mary Adams realized that another landmark had toppled before
the onrushing flood of modern Feminism The conservatism of Doctor
Craddock had yielded at last to the inevitable He too had joined the
ranks of the prophets who preach of a Womans Day of Emancipation

And yet it never occurred to her that this fact had the slightest
bearing on her personal outlook on life On the contrary she felt in the
spiritual elation of the triumphant eloquence of her favorite preacher
a renewal of her simple religious faith At the bottom of that religion
lay the foundation of life itselfher conception of marriage as the
supreme and only expression of womans power in the world

She walked back to her home on the Square in a glow of ecstatic
emotion

Surely God had miraculously saved her this night from the wiles of the
Devil No matter what this eloquent discourse had meant to others it
had renewed her faith in the oldfashioned woman and the oldfashioned
ways of the oldfashioned home Her vision was once more clear She was
glad Jane Anderson had come to put her to the test She had been tried
in the fires of hell and came forth unscorched

She stood beside her window dreaming again of the home she would build
when her Knight should stand before her revealed in beauty no words
could describe The moon was shining now in solemn glory on the
whiteshrouded Square Temptation had only strengthened the fiber of her
soul She knelt in the moonlight beside her couch and prayed that God
should ever keep her faith serene She rose with a sense of peace and
joy God would hear and answer the cry of her heart The City might be
the Desertit was still Gods world and not a sparrow that twittered in
those bare trees or chattered on her windowledge in the morning could
fall to the ground without His knowledge God had put this deathless
passion in her heart He could not deny it expression She could bide
His time If the day of her deliverance were near it was good If God
should choose to try her faith in loneliness and tears it was His way
to make the revelation of glory the more dazzling when it came

She drew the covering about her warm young body with the firm faith that
her hour was close at hand and fell asleep to dream of her Knight




CHAPTER III FATE

Mary waked next morning with the delicious sense of impending happiness
A wonderful dream had come to thrill her halfconscious moments
repeating itself in increasing vividness and beauty with each awakening
The vision had been interrupted by the unusual noise of the snow
machines on the car tracks and yet she had fallen asleep after each
break and picked up the rapturous scene at the exact moment of its
interruption

She was married and madly in love with her husband His face she could
never see quite clearly His business kept him away from home on long
trips But his baby was always therea laughing wonderful boy whose
chubby hands persisted in pulling her hair down into her face each time
she bent over his cradle to kiss him

Ella was chattering in German to someone on the stairs She wondered
again for the hundredth time how this poor slovenly oneeyed
illkempt creature scrubwoman and janitress could speak two languages
with such ease Her English except in excitement seemed equally fluent
with her German How did such a woman fall so low She was industrious
and untiring in her work She never touched liquor or drugs She was
kind and thoughtful and watched over her tenants with a motherly care
for which no landlord could pay in dollars and cents She was on her
knees on the stairs now scrubbing down the steps to be crowded again
with muddy feet from the street below

Mary lay for half an hour snuggling under the warm blankets weaving a
romance about Ellas life A great love for some heroic man who died and
left her in poverty could alone explain the mystery that hung about her
She never spoke of her life or people Mary had ventured once to ask
her A wan smile flitted across the haggard face for a moment and she
answered in low tones that closed the subject

I havent any people dear she said slowly They are dead long ago

The girl wondered if it were really true In her joy this morning she
felt her heart go out to the pathetic drooping figure on the stairs
She wished that every living creature might share the secret joy that
filled her soul

She drew the kitten from his nest beside her pillow and rubbed her cheek
against his little cold nose He always waked her with a kiss on her
eyelids and then coiled himself back for a tiny catnap until she could
make up her mind to rise

She sprang from the couch with sudden energy and stretched her dainty
figure with a prodigious yawn

Gracious Kitty we must hurry she cried thrusting her bare feet
into a pair of embroidered slippers and throwing her blue flannel kimono
on over her nightdress

The coffeepot was boiling busily when she had bathed and dressed Each
detail of her domestic schedule was given an extra care this morning
The stove was carefully polished each pot and pan placed in its rack
with a precision that spoke an unusual joy within the heart of the
housewife

And through it all she hummed a lullaby that haunted her from the
memories of a happy childhood

Breakfast over the kitten fed the birds given their bath their sand
and seed she couldnt stop until the whole place had been thoroughly
cleaned and dusted Exactly why she had done this on Thursday morning it
was impossible to say Some hidden force within had impelled her

Then back into the dream world her mind flew on joyous wings It was a
sign from God in answer to prayer Why not The Bible was full of such
revelations in ancient times God was not dead because the world was
modern and we had steam and electricity The routine of school was no
longer dull Around each commonplace child hung a halo of romance They
were lovechildren today She wove a dream of tenderness of chivalry
and heroic deeds about them all She searched each face for some line
of beauty caught in the vision of her own baby who had looked into her
heart from the mists of eternity

Three days passed in a sort of trance Never had she felt surer of life
and the full fruition of every hope and faith Just how this marvelous
blossoming would come she could not guess Her chances of meeting
her Fate were no better than at any moment of the past years of drab
disillusionment and yet for some reason her foolish heart kept
singing

Why

There could be but one answer The event was impending Such things
could be feltnot reasoned out

She applied herself to her teaching with a new energy and thoroughness
She must do this work well and carry into the real life that must soon
begin the consciousness of every duty faithfully performed

A boy asked her a question about a little flower which grew in a warm
crevice of the stone wall on which the iron fence of the school yard
rested She blushed at her failure to enlighten him and promised to tell
him on Monday

Botany was not one of her tasks but she felt the tribute to her
personality in his question and she would take pains to make her answer
full and interesting

Saturday afternoon she hurried to the Public Library on Fifth Avenue
and Fortysecond Street to look up every reference to this flower

The boulevard of the Metropolis was thronged with eager thousands
Handsome men and beautifully dressed women passed each other in endless
procession on its crowded pavements The cabs and automobiles two
abreast on either side moved at a snails pace so dense were the
throngs at each crossing Her fancy was busy weaving about each
throbbing tonneau and limousine a story of love Not a wheel was turning
in all that long line of shining vehicles that didnt carry a woman or
was hurrying to do a womans bidding

Her hero was coming too somewhere in the crowd with his gloved hand on
one of those wheels She could feel his breath on her cheek as he handed
her into the seat by his side and then the sudden leap of the car into
space and away on the wings of lightning into the future

She ascended the broad steps of the majestic building with quick
springing strength She loved this glorious library with its lofty
arched ceilings The sense of eternity that brooded over it and filled
the stately rooms rested and inspired her

Besides she forgot her poverty in this temple of all time Within its
walls she belonged to the great aristocracy of brains and culture of
which this palace was the supreme expression And it was hers Andrew
Carnegie had given the millions to build it and the city of New York
granted the site on land that was worth many millions more But it was
all built for her convenience her comfort and inspiration Every volume
of its vast and priceless collection was hershers to hold in her
hands read and ponder and enjoy Every officer and manager in its
inclosure was her servantto come at her beck and call and do her
bidding The little room on Twentythird Street was the symbol of the
future This magnificent building was the realization of the present

She smiled pleasantly to the polite assistant who received her order
slip and took her seat on the waiting line until her books were
delivered

This magnificent room with its lofty ceilings of golden panels and
drifting clouds had always brought to her a peculiar sense of restful
power The consciousness of its ownership had from the first been most
intimate No man can own what he cannot appreciate He may possess it by
legal documents but he cannot own it unless he has eyes to see ears
to hear and a heart to feel its charm This appreciation Mary Adams
possessed by inheritance from her student father who devoured books with
an insatiate hunger Nowhere in all New Yorks labyrinth did she feel
as perfectly at home as in this readingroom The quiet which reigned
without apparent sign or warning seemed to belong to the atmosphere of
the place It was unthinkable that any man or woman should be rude or
thoughtless enough to break it by a loud word

This room was hers day or night winter or summer always heated and
lighted and a hundred swift silent servants at hand to do her bidding
Around the room on serried shelves dressed in leather aprons stood
twentyfive thousand more servants of the centuries of the past ready
to answer any question her heart or brain might ask of the worlds life
since the dawn of Time

In the stackroom below on sixtythree miles of shelves stood a
million others ready to come at her slightest nod She loved to dream
here of the future in the moments she must wait for these messengers
she had summoned In this magic room the past ceased to be These
myriads of volumes made the past a myth It was all the living
throbbing presentwith only the golden future to be explored

Her number flashed in red letters on the electric blackboard

She rose and carried her books to the seat number assigned her near the
center of the southern division of the room on the extreme left beside
the bookcases containing the dictionaries of all languages

Her seat was on the aisle which skirted the shelves She found the full
description of the flower in which she was interested made her notes
and closed the volume with a lazy movement of her slender graceful
hand

She lifted her eyes and they rested on a remarkablelooking young man
about her own age who stood gazing in an embarrassed helpless sort of
way at the row of ponderous volumes marked The Century Dictionary

He was evidently a newcomer By his embarrassment she could easily tell
that it was the first time he had ever ventured into this room

He looked at the books apparently puzzled by their number He raised
his hand and ran his fingers nervously through the short thick red
hair which covered his wellshaped head

The girls attention was first fixed by the strange contrast between his
massive jaw and short neck which spoke the physical strength of an ox
and the slender gracefully tapering fingers of his small hand The wrist
was small the fingers almost feminine in their lines

He caught her look of curious interest and to her horror smiled and
walked straight to her seat

There was no mistaking his determination to speak It was useless to
drop her eyes or turn aside He would certainly follow

She blushed and gazed at him in a timid helpless fashion while he bent
over her seat and whispered awkwardly

You look kind and obliging misscould you help me a little

His tone was so genuine in its appeal so distressed and hesitating it
was impossible to resent his question

If I canyes was the prompt answer

You wont mind he asked fumbling his hat

Nowhat is it

Mary had recovered her composure as his distress had increased and
looked steadily into his steel blue eyes inquiringly

You see he went on in low hurried tones Im all worked up about
the mountains of North Carolinathinkin o goin down there to
Asheville in a car an I want to look the bloomin place up and kind o
get my bearins before I start A lawyer friend o mine told me to come
here and Id find all the maps in the Century Dictionary The man at the
desk out there told me to come in this room and look in the shelves
on the left and take it right out Gee the place is so big I get all
rattled I found the Century Dictionary on that shelf

He paused and smiled helplessly

I thought a dictionary was one booktheres a dozen of em marked
alike Im afraid to pull em all down an I dont know where to
beginCOULD you help meplease

Certainly with pleasure she answered quickly rising and leading the
way back to the shelf at which he had been gazing

You want the atlas volume she explained drawing the book from the
shelf and returning to the seat

He followed promptly and bent over her shoulder while she pointed out
the map of North Carolina the position of Asheville and the probable
route he must follow to get there

Thanks he exclaimed gratefully

Not at all she replied simply Im only too glad to be of service to
you

Her answer emboldened him to ask another question

You dont happen to know anything about that country down there do
you

Why yes I know a great deal about it

Sure enough

Ive been through Asheville many times and spent a summer there once

Did you

His tones implied that he plainly regarded her as a prodigy of
knowledge His whole attitude suggested at once the mind of an alert
interested boy asking his teacher for information on a subject near to
his heart It was impossible to resist his appeal

Why yes Mary went on in low rapid tones My people live in the
Kentucky mountains

He bent low and gently touched her arm

Say we cant talk in hereIm afraid Would it be asking too much of
you to come out in the park sit down on a bench and tell me about it
Ill never know how to thank you if you will

It was absurd of course such a request and yet his interest was so
keen his deference to her superior knowledge so humble and appealing
to refuse seemed ungracious She hesitated and rose abruptly

Just a momentIll return my books and then well go You can replace
this volume on the shelf where we got it

Thank yoo miss he responded gratefully Youre awfully kind

Dont mention it she laughed

In a moment she was walking by his side down the smooth marble stairs
and out through the grand entrance into Fifth Avenue The strange
part about it was she was not in the least excited over a very
unconventional situation She had allowed a handsomely groomed young
redhaired adventurer to pick her up without the formality of an
introduction in the Public Library She hadnt the remotest idea of his
namenor had he of hersyet there was something about him that seemed
oddly familiar They must have known one another somewhere in childhood
and forgotten each others faces

The sun was shining in clear steady brilliancy in a cloudless sky The
snow had quickly melted and it was unusually warm for early December
They turned into the throng of Fifth Avenue and at the corner of
Fortysecond Street he paused and hesitated and looked at her timidly

Say he began haltingly theres an awful crowd of bums on those
seats in the Square behind the buildingyou know Central Park dont
you

Mary smiled

Quite wellIve spent many happy hours in its quiet walks

You know that place the other side of the Mallthat ragged hill
covered with rocks and trees and mountain laurel

Ive been there often

Would you mind going there where its quietIve such a lot o things
I want to ask youyou wont mind the walk will you

Certainly notwell go there Mary responded in even businesslike
tones

Because if you dont want to walk Ill call a cab if youll let
me

Not at all was the quick answer I love to walk

It was impossible for the girl to repress a smile at her ridiculous
situation If any human being had told her yesterday that she Mary
Adams an oldfashioned girl with oldfashioned ideas of the proprieties
of life would have allowed herself to be picked up by an utter stranger
in this unceremonious way she would have resented the assertion as a
personal insultyet the preposterous and impossible thing had happened
and she was growing each moment more and more deeply interested in the
study of the remarkable youth by her side

He was not handsome in the conventional sense His features were too
strong for that An enemy might have called them coarse Their first
impression was of enormous strength and exhaustless vitality He walked
with a quick military precision and planted his small feet on the
pavement with a soft sure tread that suggested the strength of a young
tiger

The one feature that puzzled her was the size of his hands and feet
They were remarkably small and remarkable for their slender graceful
lines

His eyes were another interesting feature The lids drooped with a
careless Oriental languor as though he would shut out the glare of the
full daylight and yet the pupils flashed with a cold steelblue fire
One look into his eyes and there could be no doubt that the man behind
them was an interesting personality

She wondered what his business could be Not a lawyer or doctor or
teacher certainly His timidity in handling books was clear proof on
that point He was well groomed His clothes were made by a firstclass
tailor

Her heart thumped with a sudden fear Perhaps he was some sort of
criminal His questions may have been a trick to lure her away

They had just crossed the broad plaza at Fiftyninth Street and entered
the walkway that leads to the Mall

She stopped suddenly

Its too far to the hill beyond the Mall she began hesitatingly
Well find a seat in one of the little rustic houses along the
Fiftyninth Street side

Sure if you say so he agreed

He accepted the suggestion so simply she regretted her suspicions
instantly changed her mind and said smiling

No well go on where we started The long walk will do me good

All right he laughed whatever you says the law Im the little boy
that does just what his teacher says

She blushed and shot him a surprised look

Who told you that I was a teacher she asked with a smile

Lord nobody I had no idea of such a thing It never popped into my
head that you do anything at all You know I was awful scared when I
spoke to you

Were you she laughed

Surest thing you know Id a never screwed up my courage to do it
if you hadnt a looked so kind and gentle and sweet I just knew you
couldnt turn me down

There was no mistaking the genuineness of the apology for his
presumption She smiled a gracious answer and threw the last ugly
suspicion to the winds

He broke into a laugh and lifted his hand in the sudden gesture of a
traffic policeman commanding a halt

What is it she asked

You know I was so excited I clean forgot to introduce myself What do
you think o that Youll excuse me wont you My names Jim Anthony
Im sorry I cant give you any references to my folks I havent
anyIm a lost sheep in New Yorkno father or mother Thats why Im
so excited about this trip Im plannin down South I hear Ive got some
people down there

He stopped suddenly as if absorbed in the thought Her heart went out to
him in sympathy for this confession of his orphaned life

Im Mary Adams she smiled in answer Im a teacher in the public
schools

Geethat accounts for it I thought you looked like you knew
everything in those books And youve been to Asheville too

Yes

Suppose its not as big a burg as New York

Hardlyits just a hustling mountain town of about twentyfive
thousand people

Lot o swells from around New York live down there they tell me

Yes the Vanderbilts have a beautiful castle just outside

Some mountains near Asheville

Hundreds of square miles

Mountains in every direction

As far as the eye can reach one blue range piled above another until
theyre lost in the dim skies on the horizon

Gee it may be pretty hard to find your folks if they just live in the
mountains near Asheville

Unless your directions are more explicitI should think so

You know I thought the mountains near Asheville was a bunch o hills
off one side like the Palisades that you couldnt miss if you tried
Ive never been outside of New Yorksince I can remember Id love to
see real mountains

The last sentence was spoken in a wistful pathos that touched Mary with
its irresistible appeal Her mother instincts responded to it in quick
sympathy

Youve missed a lot she answered gravely

Ill bet I have Its a rotten old town this New York

He paused and a queer light flashed from his steel eyes

Until you get your hand on its throat he added bringing his square
jaws together

Mary lifted her face with keen interest

And youve got it by the throat

Thats just whatlittle girl he cried with a ring of pride You
see Im an inventor and I won a little pile on my first trick Ive got
a machineshop in a room eightbyten over on the East Side

A machineshop all your own

Yep

Id like to see it some day

He shook his head emphatically

Its too dirty I couldnt let a pretty girl like you in such a place
He paused and resumed the tone of his narrative where she interrupted
him You see Ive just put a new crimp in a carburetor for the
automobile folks Theyre tickled to death over it and Ive got
automobiles to burn Will you go to ride with me tomorrow

The teacher broke into a joyous laugh

Why do you laugh he asked awkwardly

Well in the language of New York that would be going some wouldnt
it

And why not Id like to know he cried with scorn Whos to tell us
we cant Youve no kids to bother you tomorrow Im my own boss Youve
seen Asheville but youve never seen New York until you sit down beside
me in a big sixcylinder racing car Im handlin next week Let me
show it to you Ill swing her around to your door at eight oclock In
twentyfive minutes well clear the Bronx and shoot into New Rochelle
Therell be no cops out to bother us and not a wheel in sight Itll do
you good Let me take you I owe you that much for bein so nice to me
today Will you go with me

Mary hesitated

Ill think it over and let you know

Got a telephone

No

Then youll have to tell me before I gowont you

I suppose so she answered demurely

They passed the big fountain beyond the Mall and skirted the lake to
the bridge crossed walked along the waters edge to the laurelcovered
crags and found a seat alone in the summer house that hides among the
trees on its highest point

The roar of the city was dim and far away The only sounds to break
the stillness were the laughter of lovers along the walks below and the
distant cry of steamers in the harbor and rivers

Youd almost think youre in the mountains up here now wouldnt you
he asked after a moments silence

Yes I call this park my country estate It costs me nothing to keep it
in perfect order The city pays for it all But I own it Every tree and
shrub and flower and blade of grass every statue and bird and animal in
it is mine I couldnt get more joy out of them if I had them inclosed
behind an iron fence and the deed to the land in my pocketnot half as
much for Id be lonely and miserable without someone to see and enjoy
it all with me

Gee thats so aint it I never looked at it like that before

He gazed at her a long time in silent admiration and then spoke
briskly

Now tell me about this North Carolina and all those miles and square
miles of mountains

Youve a piece of paper and pencil

He lifted his hand schoolboy fashion

Johnny on the spot teacher

A blankbook and pencil he threw in her lap and leaned close

Tear the leaves out if you like

No Ill just draw the maps on the pages and leave them for you to
study

With deft touch she outlined in rough on the first page the states of
New Jersey Pennsylvania Delaware Virginia and North Carolina tracing
his possible route by Trenton Philadelphia Wilmington Dover Norfolk
and Raleigh or by Washington Richmond and Danville to Greensboro

Either route you see she said softly leads to Salisbury where you
strike the foothills of the mountains Its about two hundred miles from
there to Asheville and The Land of the Sky

For two hours she answered his eager boyish questions about the country
and its people his eyes wide with admiration at her knowledge

The sun was sinking in a sea of scarlet and purple clouds behind the
tall buildings beside the Park before she realized that they had been
talking for more than two hours

She sprang to her feet blushing and confused

Mercy I had no idea it was so late

Whyis it late he asked incredulously

We must hurry

She brushed the stray ringlets of hair from her forehead laughed and
hurried down the pathway

They crossed the Park and took the Madison Avenue line to Twentythird
Street They were silent in the car The roar of the traffic was
deafening after the quiet of the summer house among the trees

I can see you home he inquired appealingly

We get off at Twentythird Street

They stood on the steps at her door beside the Square and there was a
moments awkward silence

He lifted his hat with a little chivalrous bow

Tomorrow morning at eight oclock in my car

She smiled and hesitated

Youll have a bully time

Its Sunday she stammered

Sure thats why I asked you

I dont like to miss my church

You go to church every Sunday he asked in amazement

Yes

Well just this once then Itll do you good And Ill drive as careful
as a farmer

All right she said in low tones and extended her hand

Good night

Good night teacher he responded with a boyish wave of his slender
hand and quickly disappeared in the crowd

She rushed up the stairs her cheeks aflame her heart beating a tattoo
of foolish joy

She snatched the kitten from sleep and whispered in his tiny ear

Oh Kitty dear Ive had such an adventure Ive spent the happiest
silliest afternoon of my life Im going to have a more wonderful day
tomorrow I just feel it In a big racing automobile if you please Mr
Thomascat Sorry I cant take you but the dust would blind you Kitty
dear Im sorry to tell you that youll have to stay at home all day
alone and keep house Its too bad But Ill fix your milk and bread
before I go and you must promise me on your sacred Persian cats honor
not to look at my birds

She hugged him violently and he purred his soft answer in song

Oh Kitty Im so happyso foolishly happy




CHAPTER IV DOUBTS AND FEARS

Mary attempted no analysis of her emotions It was all too sudden
too stunning She was content to feel and enjoy the first overwhelming
experience of life Hour after hour she lay among the pillows of her
couch in the dim light of the street lamps and lazily watched the
passing Saturday evening crowds The world was beautiful

She undressed at last and went to bed only to toss wideeyed for hours

A hundred times she reenacted the scene in the Library and recalled
her first impression of Jims personality What could such an utterly
unforeseen and extraordinary meeting mean except that it was her Fate
Certainly he could not have planned it Certainly she had not foreseen
such an event It had never occurred to her in the wildest flights of
fancy that she could meet and speak to a man under such conditions
to say nothing of the walk in the Park and the hours she spent in the
little summer house

And the strangest part of it all was that she could see nothing wrong
in it from beginning to end It had happened in the simplest and most
natural way imaginable By the standards of conventional propriety her
act was the maddest folly and yet she was still happy over it

There was one disquieting trait about him that made her a little uneasy
He used the catchwords of the street gamins of New York without any
consciousness of incongruity She thought at first that he did this as
the Southern boy of culture and refinement unconsciously drops into the
tones and dialect of the negro by daily association His constant use
of the expressive and characteristic Gee was startling to say the
least And yet it came from his lips in such a boyish way she felt sure
that it was due to his embarrassment in the unusual position in which he
had found himself with her

His helplessness with the dictionary was proof of course that he was
no scholar And yet a boy might have a fair education in the schools of
today and be unfamiliar with this ponderous and dignified encyclopedia
of words It was impossible to believe that he was illiterate His
clothes his carriage even his manners made such an idea preposterous

Besides no inventor could be really illiterate He may have been forced
to work and only attended night schools But if he were a mechanic
capable of making a successful improvement on one of the most delicate
and important parts of an automobile he must have studied the
principles involved in his inventions

His choice of a profession appealed to her imagination too It showed
independence and initiative It opened boundless possibilities He might
be an obscure and poorly educated boy today In five years he could be
a millionaire and the head of some huge business whose interests circled
the world

The tired brain wore itself out at last in eager speculations and she
fell into a fitful stupor The roar of the streetcars waked her at
daylight and further sleep was out of the question She rose dressed
quickly and got her breakfast in a quiver of nervous excitement over the
adventure of the coming automobile

As the hour of eight drew nearer her doubts of the propriety of going
became more acute

What on earth has come over me in the past twentyfour hours she
asked of herself Ive known this man but a day I dont KNOW him
at all and yet Im going to put my life in his hands in that racing
machine Have I gone crazy

She was not in the least afraid of him His face and voice and
personality all seemed familiar Her brain and commonsense told her
that such a trip with an utter stranger was dangerous and foolish beyond
words In his automobile unaccompanied by a human soul and unacquainted
with the roads over which they would travel she would be absolutely in
his power

She set her teeth firmly at last her mind made up

Its too mad a risk I was crazy to promise I wont go

She had scarcely spoken her resolution when the soft call of the
autohorn echoed below She stood irresolute for a moment and the call
was repeated in plaintive appealing notes

She tried to hold fast to her resolutions but the impulse to open the
window and look out was resistless She turned the oldfashioned brass
knob swung her windows wide on their hinges and leaned out

His keen eyes were watching He lifted his cap and waved She answered
with the flutter of her handkerchiefand all resolutions were off

Of course Ill go she cried with a laugh Its a glorious dayI
may never have such a chance again



CHAPTER V WINGS OF STEEL

She threw on her furs and hurried downstairs Her surrender was too
sudden to realize that she was being driven by a power that obscured
reason and crushed her will

Reason made one more vain cry as she paused at the door below to draw on
her gloves

You have refused every invitation to see or know the unconventional
world into which thousands of women in New York cleareyed and
unafraid enter daily Youd sooner die than pose an hour in Gordons
studio and on a Sabbath morning you cut your church and go on a days
wild ride with a man you have known but fifteen hours

And the voice inside quickly answered

But thats different Gordons a married man My chevalier is not I
have the right to go and he has the right

It was settled anyhow before this little controversy arose at the street
door but the ready answer she gave eased her conscience and cleared the
way for a happy exciting trip

He leaped from the big ugly racer to help her in stopped and looked at
her light clothing

Thats your heaviest coat

Yes It isnt cold

Ive one for you

He drew an enormous fur coat from the car and held it up for her arms

You think Ill need that she asked

His white teeth gleamed in a friendly smile

Take it from me Kiddo you certainly will

She winced just a little at the common expression but he said it with
such a quick boyish enthusiasm she wondered whether he were quoting
the expression from the Bowery boys vocabulary or using it in a
facetious personal way

I knew youd need it So I brought it for you he added genially

Thanks she murmured lifting her arms and drawing the coat about her
trim figure

He helped her into the car and drew from his pocket a light pair of
goggles

Now these and youre all hunkydory

Will I need these too she asked incredulously

Will you he cried You wouldnt ask that question if you knew
the horse weve got hitched to this benzine buggy today Hes got
wingsbelieve me Its all I can do to hold him on the ground
sometimes

Youll drive carefully she faltered

He lifted his hand

With you settin beside me my first names Caution

She fumbled the goggles in a vain effort to lift her arms over her head
to fasten them on He sprang into the seat by her side and promptly
seized them

Let me fix em

His slender skillful fingers adjusted the band and brushed a stray
ringlet of hair back under the furs The thrill of his touch swept her
with a sudden dizzy sense of excitement She blushed and drew her head
down into the collar of the shaggy coat

He touched the wheel and the gray monster leaped from the curb and shot
down the street The single impulse carried them to the crossing He had
shut off the power as the machine gracefully swung into Fourth Avenue
The turn made another leap and the car swept up the Avenue and swung
through Twentysixth Street into Fifth Avenue Again the power was off
as he made the turn into Fifth Avenue at a snails pace

Cant let her out yet he whispered apologetically Had to make these
turns Theres no room for her inside of town

Mary had no time to answer He touched the wheel and the car shot up
the deserted Avenue She gasped for breath and braced her feet her
whole being tingling with the first exhilarating consciousness that she
too was possessed of the devil of speed madness It was glorious For
the first time in her life space and distance lost their meaning She
was free as the birds in the heavens She was flying on the wings
of this gray steel monster through space The palaces on the Avenue
whirled by in dim ghostlike flashes They flew through Central Park
into Seventysecond Street and out into the Drive The waters of the
river broad and cool flashing in the morning sun rested her eyes a
moment and then faded in a twinkling They had leaped the chasm beyond
Grants Tomb plunged into Broadway and before she could get her
bearings swept up the hill at One Hundred and Fiftyfifth Street
slipped gracefully across the iron bridge and in a jiffy were lost in a
gray cloud of dust on the Boston Turnpike

When the first intoxicating joy of speed had spent itself she found
herself shuddering at the daring turns he made missing a curb by a
hairs breadthgrazing a trolley by half an inch Her fears were soon
forgotten

The hand on the wheel was made of steel too

The throbbing demon encased within the hood obeyed his slightest whim
She glanced at the square massive jaw with furtive admiration

Without turning his head he laughed

You like it teacher

Im in Heaven

You wont worry about church then will you

Not today

They stopped at a roadhouse and he put in more gasoline lifted the
casing from the engine touched each vital part examined his tires and
made sure that his machine was at its best

She watched him with a growing sense of his strength of character his
poise and executive ability He was an awkward stammering boy in the
Library yesterday Today with this machine in his hand he was the master
of Time and Space

She yielded herself completely to the delicious sense of his protection
The extraordinary care he was giving the machine was a plain avowal of
his deep regard for her comfort and happiness She had been in one or
two moderately moving cars driven by careful chauffeurs through Central
Park She had always felt on those trips with Jane Anderson like a poor
relation from the country imposing on a rich friend

This trip was all her own The car and its master were there solely for
her happiness Her slightest whim was law for both It was sweet this
sense of power She began to lift her body with a touch of pride

She laughed now at fears What nonsense No Knight of the Age of
Chivalry could treat her with more deference He had tried already to
get her to stop for a bite of lunch

Dont you want a thing to eat he persisted

Not a thing Ive just had my breakfast Its only nine oclock

I know but weve come thirty miles and the air makes you hungry We
ought to eat about six good meals a day

She shook her head

Nonot yet Im too happy with these new wings I want to fly some
morecome on

He lifted his hand in his favorite gesture of obedience

Nuff saidwell streak it back now by another road hump it through
town and jump over the Brooklyn Bridge Ill show you Coney Island and
then I know youll want a hot dog anyhow

He crossed the country and darted into Broadway Before she could
realize it the last tree and field were lost behind in a cloud of dust
and they were again in the crowded streets of the city The deep growl
of his horn rang its warnings for each crossing and Mary watched the
timid women scramble to the sidewalks five and six blocks ahead

It was delicious She had always been the one to scramble before Her
heart went out in a wave of tenderness to the man by her side strong
daring masterful her chevalier her protector and admirer

Yes her admirer There was no doubt on that point The moment he
relaxed the tension of his hand on the wheel his deep mysterious
eyes beneath the drooping lids were fixed on hers in open shameless
admiration Their cold fire burned into her heart and thrilled to her
fingertips

In spite of his deference and his obedience to her whim she felt the
iron grip of his personality on her imagination Whatever his education
his origin or his environment he was a power to be reckoned with

No other type of man had ever appealed to her Her conception of a real
man had always been one who did his own thinking and commanded rather
than asked the respect of others

She had thrown the spell of her beauty over this headstrong masterful
man He was wax in her hands A delicious sense of power filled her She
had never known what happiness meant before She floated through space
The spinning lines of towering buildings on Broadway passed as mists in
a dream

As the velvet feet of the car touched the great bridge she lazily opened
her eyes for a moment and gazed through the lacework of steel at the
broad sweep of the magnificent harbor The dark blue hills of Staten
Island framed the picture

He was right She had never seen New York before Never before had
its immense panorama been swept within two hours Never before had she
realized its dimensions She had always felt stunned and crushed in the
effort to conceive it Today she had wings The city lay at her feet
conquered She was mistress of Time and Space

Again her sidelong glance swept the lines of Jim Anthonys massive jaw
She laughed softly

Whats the matter he asked

Nothing Im just happy

She blushed and wondered if he had read her thoughts by some subtle
power of clairvoyance She was speculating on the effects of love at
first sight on such a man Would he hesitate back and fill and hang
on for months trying in vain to gain the courage to speak Or would he
spring with the leap of a young tiger the moment he realized what he
wanted

Her own attitude was purely one of joyous expectancy It would of
course be a long time before her feelings could take any definite
attitude toward a man For the moment she was supremely happy It was
enough She made no effort to probe her feelings She might return to
earth tomorrow Today she was in Heaven She would make the most of it

They skimmed the wooded cliffs of Bay Ridge her heart beating in
ecstasy at the revelation of beauty of whose existence she had not
dreamed

I bet you never saw this drive before now did you he asked with
boyish enthusiasm

Noits wonderful

Some vieweh

Entrancing

You know when I make my pile Id like a palace of white marble perched
on this cliff with the windows on the south looking out over Sandy Hook
and the windows on the west looking over that fort on the top of Staten
Island with its black eyes gazing over the sea How would you like
that

She turned away to mask the smile she couldnt repress

That would be splendid wouldnt it

I like the water dont you

I love it

Water and hills both right together I reckon my father must a been a
seacaptain and my mother from the mountains

He said this with a pathos that found the girls heart What a pitiful
lonely life a boys without even the memory of a mother or father
The mother instinct rose in a resistless flood of pity Her eyes grew
suddenly dim

Well he said briskly now for the dainty job Ive got to jump my
way through that Coney Island bunch You see my low speeds a racing
pace for an everyday car All I can do in a crowd is to jump from one
crossing to the next and cut her power off every time You can bet Ill
make a guy or two jump with me

You wont hurt anyone she pleaded

Lord no I wouldnt dare to put her through that mob in the afternoon
Id kill a regiment of em But its earlyjust the shank of the
morning Theres nobody down here yet

The car suddenly leaped into the Avenue that runs through the heart of
Coney Island the deepthroated horn screaming its warning The crowd
scattered like sheep before a lion

The girl laughed in spite of her effort at selfcontrol

Watch em hump Jim grunted

Its funny isnt it

When youre in the caryes It dont seem so funny when youre on
foot Well some people were made to walk and some to ride I had to
hoof it at first I like riding betterdont you

To be perfectly honestyes

The car leaped forward again the horn screaming The wheel passed
within a foot of a fat womans skirt With a cry of terror she fled to
the sidewalk and shook her fist at Jim her face purple with anger

He waved his hand back at her

Never touched you dearie Never touched you

Mary lost all fear of accident and watched him handle the machine with
the skill of a master She could understand now the spirit of deviltry
in a chauffeur who knows his business It seemed a wicked cruel thing
from the groundthis swift plunge of a car as if bent on murder But
now that she felt the sure velvet grip of the brake in a masters hand
she saw that the danger was largely a myth

It was fun to see people jump at the approach of an avalanche of steel
that always stopped just short of harm Of course it took a steady
nerve and muscle to do the trick The man by her side had both He was
always smiling Nothing rattled him

Her trust was now implicit She relaxed the tension of the first two
hours of doubt and fear and yielded to the spell of his strength It
seemed inseparable from the throbbing will of the giant machine He was
its incarnate spirit She was being swept through space now on the wings
of omnipotent powerbut power always obedient to her whim

With steady even pulse they glided down the long broad Avenue to
Prospect Park swung through its winding lanes on through the streets
of Brooklyn and once more into the open road

Now for Long Beach and a good lunch he cried Ill show you
somethingbut youll have to shut your eyes to see it

With a sudden bound the car leaped into the air and shot through the
sky with the hiss and shriek of a demon

The girl caught her breath and instinctively gripped his arm

Look out Kiddo he shouted Dont touch meor well both land in
Kingdom Come I aint ready for a harp just yet Id rather fool with
this toy for a while down here

She braced her feet and gripped the sides of the car gasping for
breath steadied herself at last and crouched low among the furs to
guard her throat from the icy daggers of the wind

The landscape whirled in a circle of trees and sky while above the dark
line of hills hung the boiling cauldron of cloudbanked heavens

Are you game he called above the roar

Yes she gasped Dont stop

Her soul had risen at last to the ecstasy of the mania for speed that
fired the mans spirit and nerved his hand It was inconceivable
until experiencedthis awful joy Her spirit sank with childish
disappointment as he slowly lowered the power

Got to take a sharp curve down there he explained We turn to the
right for the meadows and the Beachhow was that

Wonderful she cried with dancing eyes Let her go again if you want
toIm gamenow

Jim laughed

A little rattled at first

Yes

Well we cant let her out on this road Its too narrowhave to take
a ditch sometimes to pass That wouldnt do for an eightymile clip you
knownow would it

Hardly

I might risk it alonebut my first names Old Man Caution todayyou
get me

Mary nodded and turned her head away again

I got you the first time sir she answered playfully taking his tone

He ran the car into the garage at the Beach sprang out and lifted Mary
to the ground with quick firm hand They threw off their heavy coats
and left them

Look out for this junk now sonny he cried to the attendant tossing
him a half dollar

Sure Mike

Fill her up to the chin by the time we get back

Righto

Quickly they walked to the hotel and in five minutes were seated beside
a window in the diningroom watching the lazy roll of the sea sweep in
on the sands at low tide

Im hungry as a wolf he whispered

So am I

Well eat everything in sightstart at the top and come down

He handed her the menu card and watched her from the depths beneath the
drooping eyelids

Conscious of his gaze and rejoicing in its frank admiration she ordered
the dinner with instinctive good taste No effort at conversation was
made by either They were both too hungry As Jim lighted his cigarette
when the coffee was served he leaned back in his chair and watched the
breakers in silence

Thats the best dinner I ever had in my life he said slowly

It was good We were hungry

Ive been hungry before many a time It was something else too He
paused and rose abruptly Lets walk up the Beach

Id love to she answered slowly rising



CHAPTER VI BESIDE THE SEA

They strolled leisurely along the boardwalk found the sand walked in
the firm dry line of the highwater mark for a mile to the east and
sat down on a clump of seagrass on the top of a sand dune

I like this she cried joyously

So do I he answered soberly and lapsed into silence

The sun was warm and genial The wind had died and the waves of the
rising tide were creeping up the long sloping stretches of the sand
with a lazy soothing rush A winter gull poised above their heads and
soared seaward The smoke of an ocean liner streaked the horizon as she
swept toward the channel off Sandy Hook

Jim looked at the girl by his side and tried to speak She caught the
strained expression in his strong face and lowered her eyes

He began to trace letters in the sand

She knew with unerring instinct that he had made his first desperate
effort to speak his love and failed Would he give it up and wait for
weeks and possibly monthsor would he storm the citadel in one mad rush
at the beginning

He found his voice at last He had recovered from the panic of his first
impulse

Well how do you like my idea of a good day as far as youve gone he
asked lightly

She met his gaze with perfect frankness The happiest day I ever spent
in my life she confessed

Honest

Honest

Oh shuckswhats the use he cried with sudden fierce resolution
Youve got me Kiddo youve got me Ive been eatin out of your hand
since the minute I laid my eyes on you in that big room Im all yours
You can do anything you want with me For Gods sake tell me that you
like me a little

The blood slowly mounted to her cheeks in red waves of tremulous
emotion

I like you very much she said in low tones

He seized her hand and held it in a desperate grip

I love you Kiddo he went on passionately You dont mind me calling
you Kiddo Youre so dainty and pretty and sweet and that dimple keeps
coming in your cheek it just seems like thats the wordyou dont
mind

No

You dont know how Ive been starvin all my life for the love of a
pure girl like you Youre the first one I ever spoke to I was scared
to death yesterday when I saw you But Id a spoke to you if it killed
me in my tracks I couldnt help it It just looked like an angel had
dropped right down out of the gold clouds from that ceilin I was
afraid Id lose you in the crowd and never see you again It didnt seem
you were a stranger anyhowI didnt seem strange to you did I

Her lips quivered and she was silent

Didnt you feel like youd known me somewhere before he pleaded

Yes

I just felt you did and thats what give me courage Oh Kiddo youve
got to love me a littleIve never been loved by a human soul in all my
life The first thing I remember was hidin under a stoop from a brute
who beat me every night I ran away and slept in barrels and crawled
into coal shutes till I was big enough to earn a livin sellin papers
For years I never knew what it meant to have enough to eat I just
scratched and fought my way through the streets like a little hungry
wolf till I got in a blacksmiths shop down on South Street and learned
to handle tools I was quick and smart and the old man liked me and let
me sleep in the shop I had enough to eat then and got strong as an ox
I went to the night schools and learned to read and write I dont know
anything but Im quick and you can teach meyou will wont you

Ill try was the low answer

You do like me Kiddo Say it again

She rose to her feet and looked out over the sea her face scarlet

Yes I do she said at last

With a sudden resistless sweep he clasped her in his arms and kissed her
lips

Her heart leaped in mad response to the first kiss a lover had ever
given Her body quivered and relaxed in his embrace It was sweetit
was wonderful beyond words

He kissed her again and she clung to him lifting her eyes to his at
last in a long wondering gaze and then pressed her own lips to his

Oh my God Kiddo you love me It beats the world dont it Love at
first sight for both of us Ive heard about it but I didnt think it
would ever happen to me like thisdid you

She shook her head and bit her lips as the tears slowly dimmed her eyes

It takes my breath she murmured I cant realize what it all means
It seems too wonderful to be true

And you wont turn me down because I dont know who my father and
mother was

Nomy heart goes out to you in a great pity for your lonely wretched
boyhood

I couldnt help thatnow could I

Of course not Its wonderful that youve made your way alone and won
the fight of life

He gripped her hands and held her at arms length devouring her with
his deep slumbering eyes

Gee but youre a brick little girl I thought you were an angel when
I first saw you Now I know it Just watch me work for you Ill show
you a thing or two Youll marry me right away wont you

He bent close his breath on her lips

Her eyes drooped under his passionate gaze and the tears slowly stole
down her cheeks Her hour of life had struck So suddenly so utterly
unexpectedly it rang a thunderbolt from the clear sky

You will wont you he pleaded

She smiled at him through her tears and slowly said

I cant say yes today

Whywhy

Youve swept me off my feetII cant think

I dont want you to thinkI want you to marry me right now

I must have a little time

His face fell in despair

Say little girl dont turn me downyoull kill me

Im not turning you down she protested tenderly I only want time to
see that Im not crazy I have to pinch myself to see if Im awake It
all seems a dreamshe paused and lifted her radiant face to hisa
beautiful dreamthe most wonderful my soul has ever seen I must be
sure its real

He drew her into his arms and her body again relaxed in surrender as
his lips touched hers

Isnt that the real thing he laughed

She lay very still her eyes closed her face a scarlet flame She was
frightened at the swift realization of its overwhelming reality The
touch of his hand thrilled to the last fiber and nerve of her body Her
own trembling fingers clung to him with desperate longing tenderness
She roused herself with an effort and drew away

Thats enough now I must have a little commonsense Lets go

He clung to her hand

Youll let me come to see you tomorrow night

Yes

And the next nightand every night this weekwhats the difference
Theres nobody to say no is there

No one

Youll let me

Tomorrow sure Maybe you wont want to come the next night

Maybe I wont Just wait and see

He seized both hands again and held her at arms length

Dont go yetjust let me look at you a minute more The only girl I
ever had in my lifeand shes the prettiest thing God ever made on this
earth Aint I the lucky boy

We must go now she cried blushing again under his burning eyes

He dropped her hands suddenly and saluted military fashion

All right teacher Im the little boy that does exactly what hes
told

They strolled leisurely along the shining sands in silence Now and then
his slender hand caught hers and crushed it The moment he touched her
a living flame flashed through her bodyand through every moment of
contact her nerves throbbed and quivered as if a musician were sweeping
the strings of a harp If this were not love what could it be

Her whole being body and soul responded to his Her body moved
instinctively toward his drawn by some hidden resistless power Her
hands went out to meet his her lips leaped to his

She must test it with time of course And yet she knew by a deep inner
sense that time could only fan the flame that had been kindled into
consuming fire that must melt every barrier between them

She had asked him nothing of himself his business or his future and
knew nothing except what he had told her in the first impetuous rush of
his confession of love No matter The big thing today was the fact
of love and the new radiance with which it was beginning to light the
world The effect was stunning Their conversation had been the simplest
of commonplace questions and answersand yet the day was the one
miracle of her lifeher happiness something unthinkable until realized

She had not asked time in order to know him better She had only asked
time to see herself more clearly in the new experience Not for a moment
did she raise the question of the worthiness of the man she loved It
was inconceivable that she should love a man not worthy of her The only
questions asked were soulsearching ones put to herself

Through the sweet cool drive homeward a hundred times she asked
within

Is this love

And each time the answer came from the depths

Yesyesa thousand times yes Its the voice of God I feel it and I
know it

He throttled the racer down to the lowest speed and took the longest
road home

Again and again he slipped his left hand from the wheel and pressed
hers

You wont let anybody knock me behind my back now will you little
girl

She pressed his hand in answer

I aint got a single friend in all Gods world to stand up for me but
just you

You dont need anyone she whispered

Youll give me a chance to get back at em if any of your friends knock
me wont you

Why should they dislike you

He shrugged his shoulders

Well I aint exactly one o the highflyers now am I

Im glad youre not

Sure enough

Yes

Then its me for you Kiddo for this world and the next

The car swung suddenly to the curb and Mary lifted her eyes with a start
to find herself in front of her home

Jim sprang to the ground and lifted her out

Keep this coat he whispered Well need it tomorrow What time is
your school out

At three oclock

I can come at four

You dont have to work tomorrow

He hesitated a moment

No Im on a vacation till after Christmas Theyre putting through my
new patent

He followed her inside the door and held her hand in the shadows of the
hall

All right at four she said

Ill be here

He stooped and kissed her turned and passed quickly out

She stood for a moment in the shadows and listened to the throb of the
car until it melted into the roar of the citys life her heart beating
with a joy so new it was pain




CHAPTER VII A VAIN APPEAL

A week passed on the wings of magic

Every day at four oclock the car was waiting at her door The drab
interior of the schoolroom had lost its terror No annoyance could
break the spell that reigned within Her patience was inexhaustible her
temper serene

Walking with swift step down the Avenue to her home she wondered vaguely
how she could have been lonely in all the music and the wonder of New
Yorks marvelous life The windows of the stores were already crowded
with Christmas cheer and busy thousands passed through their doors
Each man or woman was a swift messenger of love Somewhere in the
shadows of the citys labyrinth a human heart would beat with quickened
joy for every step that pressed about these crowded counters Love had
given new eyes to see new ears to hear and a new heart to feel the joys
and sorrows of life

She hadnt given her consent yet She was still asking her silly heart
to be sure of herself Of her lover the depth and tenderness the
strength and madness of his love there could be no doubt Each day he
had given new tokens

For Saturday afternoon she had told him not to bring the car

When they reached Fifth Avenue across the Square he stopped abruptly
and faced her with a curious uneasy look

Say tell me why you wanted to walk

I had a good reason she said evasively

Yes but why Its a sin to lay that car up a day like this Look
here

He stopped and tried to gulp down his fears

Look hereyoure not going to throw me down after leading me to the
very top of the roof are you

She looked up with tender assurance

Not today

Then why hoof it Let me run round to the garage and shoot her out You
can wait for me at the Waldorf Ive always wanted to push my buzzwagon
up to that big joint and wait for my girl to trip down the steps

No Ive a plan of my own today Let me have my way

All rightojust so youre happy

I am happy she answered soberly

At the foot of the broad stairs of the Library she paused and looked up
smilingly at its majestic front

Come in a moment she said softly

He followed her wonderingly into the vaulted hall and climbed the grand
staircase to the readingroom She walked slowly to the shelf on which
the Century Dictionary rested and looked laughingly at the seat in which
she sat Saturday afternoon a week ago at exactly this hour

Jim smiled leaned close and whispered

I got you KiddoI got you Get out of here quick or Ill grab you and
kiss you

She started and blushed

Dont you dare

Beat it thenbeat itor I cant help it

She turned quickly and they passed through the catalogue room and
lightly down the stairs

He held her soft round arm with a grip that sent the blood tingling to
the roots of her brown hair

You understand now she whispered

You bet We walk the same way up the Avenue through the Park to the
little house on the laurel hill And youre goin to be sweet to me
today my KiddoI just feel it I

Dont be too sure sir she interrupted solemnly

He laughed aloud

You cant fool me nowand Im crazy as a June bug You know I like to
walkif I can be with you

At the Park entrance she stopped again and smiled roguishly

Well find a seat in one of the summer houses along the Fiftyninth
Street side

All right he responded

Nowell go on where we started

With a laugh she slipped her hand through his arm

You were a little scared of me last Saturday about this time werent
you

Just a little

It hurt me too but I didnt let you know

Im sorry

Its all right nowits all right Gee I but weve traveled some in a
week havent we

Ive known you more than a week she protested gayly

SureIve known you since I was born

They walked through the stately rows of elms on the Mall in joyous
silence Crowds of children and nurses lovers and loungers filled the
seats and thronged the broad promenade

Scarcely a word was spoken until they reached the rustic house nestling
among the trees on the hill

Just a week by the calendar she murmured And Ive lived a
lifetime

Its all right thenlittle girl Youll marry me right away
Whentonight

Hardly

Tomorrow then

She drew the glove from her hand and held the slender fingers up before
him

You can get the ring

Gee I do have to get a ring dont I

Yes

Why didnt you tell me You know I never got married before

I should hope not

He seized her hand and kissed it drew her into his arms held her
crushed and breathless and released her with a quick impulsive
movement

Youll help me get it he asked eagerly

If you like

A big white sparkler

Nono

No

A plain little gold band

Let me get you a big diamond

Noa plain gold band

Its all settled then

Were engaged Youre my fiance

But for Gods sake Kiddohow long do I have to be a fiance

A ripple of laughter rang through the trees

Dont you think weve done pretty well for seven days

I could have settled it in seven minutes after we met he answered
complainingly You wont tell me the day yet

Not yet

All right well just have to take blessings as they come then

Through the beautiful afternoon they sat side by side with closepressed
hands and planned the future which love had given A modest flat far up
among the trees on the cliffs overlooking the Hudson they decided on

Well begin with that he cried enthusiastically but we wont stay
there long Ive got big plans Im going to make a million The white
house down by the sea for me a yacht out in the front yard and a
halfdozen thundering autos in the garage If this deal Im on now goes
through Ill make my pile in a year

They rose as the shadows lengthened

I must go home and feed my pets she sighed

All right he responded heartily Ill get the car and be there in a
jiffy Well take a spin out to a roadhouse for dinner

She lifted her eyes tenderly

You can come right up to my roomnow that were engaged

He swept her into his arms again and held her in unresisting happiness

It was dark when he swung the gray car against the curb and sprang out
He didnt blow his horn for her to come down The privilege she had
granted was too sweet and wonderful He wouldnt miss it for the world

The stairs were dark Ella was late this afternoon getting back to her
work His light footstep scarcely made a sound He found each step with
quick instinctive touch The building seemed deserted The tenants were
all on trips to the country and the seashore The day was one of rare
beauty and warmth Someone was fumbling in the dark on the third floor
back

He made his way quickly to her room and softly knocked waited a moment
and knocked again There was no response He couldnt be mistaken He
had seen her lean out of that window every day the past week

Perhaps she was busy in the kitchenette and the noise from the street
made it impossible to hear

He placed his hand on the doorknob

From the darkness of the hall in a quick tiger leap Ella threw
herself on him and grappled for his throat

What are you doing at that door you dirty thief she growled

Here Here Whatellwhats the matter with you he gasped gripping
her hands and tearing them from his neck Im no thief

You are You are too she shrieked I heard you sneak in the door
downstairsheard you slippin like a cat upstairs Get out of here
before I call a cop

She was savagely pushing him back to the landing of the stairs With a
sudden lurch Jim freed himself and gripped her hands

Cut it Cut it Or Ill knock your block off Ive come to take my girl
to ride

He drew a match and quickly lighted the gas as Marys footstep echoed on
the stairs below

Well shes coming nowwell see was the sullen answer

Ella surveyed him from head to foot her one eye gleaming in angry
suspicion

Mary sprang up the last step and saw the two confronting each other She
had heard the angry voices from below

Why Ella whats the matter she gasped

He was trying to break into your room

Jim threw up his hands in a gesture of rage and Mary broke into a
laugh

Why nonsense Ella I asked him to come This is Mr Anthonyher
voice droppedmy fiance

Ellas figure relaxed with a look of surprise

Oh ja she murmured as if dazed

Yescome in she said to Jim Sorry I was out I had to run to the
grocers for the Kitty

Ella glared at Jim turned and began to light the other hall lamps
without any attempt at apology

Jim entered the room with a look of awe took in its impression of
sweet homelike order and recovered quickly his composure

Gee youre the dandy little housekeeper I could stay here forever

You like it

Its a birds nest He glanced in the mirror and saw the print of
Ellas fingers on his collar Will you look at that he growled

Its too bad she said sympathetically

You know I thought a shetiger had got loose from the Bronx and jumped
on me

Im awfully sorry she apologized Ellas very fond of me She was
trying to protect me She couldnt see who it was in the dark

No I reckon not Jim laughed

Ive changed our plans for the evening she announced We wont go
to ride tonight I want you to bring my best friend to dinner with us at
Mouquins Go after her in the car I want to impress her

I got you Kiddo Shes goin to look me overeh All right Ill
stop at the store and get a clean collar I wouldnt like her to see the
print of that tigers claw on my neck

Theres her address the Gainsborough Studios Drop me at Mouquins and
Ill have the table set in one of the small rooms upstairs Ill meet
you at the door

Jim glanced at the address put it in his pocket and helped her draw on
her heavy coat

Youll be nice to Jane I want her to like you Shes the only real
friend Ive ever had in New York

Ill do my best for you little girl he promised

He dropped her at the wooden cottagefront on Sixth Avenue near
Twentyeighth Street and returned in twenty minutes with Jane

As the tall artist led the way upstairs Jim whispered

Say for Gods sake let me out of this

Why

Shes a frost If I have to sit beside her an hour Ill catch cold and
die I swear it save me Save my life

Sh Its all right Shes fine and generous when you know her

They had reached the door and Mary pushed him in There was no help for
it Hed have to make the most of it

The dinner was a dismal failure

Jane Anderson was polite and genial but there was a straight look of
wonder in her clear gray eyes that froze the blood in Jims veins

Mary tried desperately for the first halfhour to put him at his
ease It was useless The attack of Ella had upset his nerves and the
unexpressed hostility of Jane had completely crushed his spirits He
tried to talk once stammered and lapsed into a sullen silence from
which nothing could stir him

The two girls at last began to discuss their own affairs and the dinner
ended in a sickening failure that depressed and angered Mary

The agony over at last she rose and turned to Jim

You can go now sirIll take Jane home with me for a friendly chat

Thank God he whispered grinning in spite of his effort to keep a
straight face

Tomorrow he asked in low tones

At eight oclock

Jim bowed awkwardly to Jane muttered something inarticulate and rushed
to his car

The two girls walked in silence through Twentyeighth Street to Broadway
and thence across the Square

Seated in her room Mary could contain her pentup rage no longer

Jane Anderson Im furious with you How could you be so rudeso
positively insulting

Insulting

Yes You stared at him in cold disdain as if he were a toad under your
feet

I assure you dear

Why did you do it

The artist rose walked to the window looked out on the Square for a
moment extended her hand and laid it gently on Marys shoulder

Youve made up your mind to marry this man honey

I certainly have was the emphatic answer

Jane paused

And all in seven days

Seven days or seven yearswhat does it matter Hes my matewe
loveits Fate

Its incredible

Whats incredible

Such madness

Perhaps love is madnessthe madness that makes life worth the candle
Ive never lived before the past week

And you the dainty cultured pious little saint will marry
thisthis

Say it I want you to be frank

Perfectly frank

Absolutely

This coarse ugly illiterate brute

Jane Anderson how dare you Mary sprang to her feet livid with rage

I asked if I might be frank Shall I lie to you Or shall I tell you
what I think

Say what you please it doesnt matter Mary interrupted angrily

I only speak at all because I love you Your commonsense should tell
you that I speak with reluctance But now that I have spoken let me
beg of you for your fathers sake for your dead mothers sake for my
sakeIm your one disinterested friend and you know that my love is
realfor the sake of your own souls salvation in this world and the
nextdont marry that brute Commit suicide if you willjump off the
bridgetake poison cut your throat blow your brains outbut oh dear
God not this

And why may I ask was the cold question

Hes in no way your equal in culture in character in any of the
essentials on which the companionship of marriage must be based

Hes a diamond in the rough Mary staunchly asserted

Hes in the rough all right The only diamond about him is the one in
his red scarfTake it from me Kiddo Take it from me

Her last sentence was a quotation from Jim her imitation of his slang
so perfect Marys cheeks flamed anew with anger

Ill teach him to use good Englishnever fear In a month hell forget
his slang and his red scarf

You mean that in a month youll forget to use good English and his
style of dress will be yours Oh honey cant you see that such a man
will only drag you down down to his level Can it be possible that
youthat you really love him

I adore him and Im proud of his love

Now listen You believe in an indissoluble marriage dont you

Yes

Its the first article of your creedthat marriage is a holy
sacrament that no power on earth or in hell can ever dissolve its
bonds Fools rush in where angels fear to tread my dear They always
havethey always will I suppose This is peculiarly true of your type
of womanthe dainty clinging girl of religious enthusiasm Youre
peculiarly susceptible to the physical power of a brutal lover Your
soul glories in submission to this force The more coarse and brutal its
attraction the more abject and joyful the surrender Your religion cant
save you because your religion is purely emotionalit is only another
manifestation of your sex emotions

How can you be so sacrilegious the girl interrupted with a look of
horror

It may shock you dear but Im telling you one of the simplest truths
of Nature Youd as well know it now as later The moment you wake to
realize that your emotions have been deceived and bankrupted your faith
will collapse At least keep your grip on commonsense Down in the
cowardly soul of every weak womanperhaps of every womanis the insane
desire to be dominated by a superior brute force The woman of the lower
classesthe peasant of Russia for example whose sex impulses are of
all races the most violentrefuses with scorn the advances of the man
who will not strike her The man who cant beat his wife is beneath
contempthe is no man at all

Mary broke into a laugh

Really Jane you cease to be serious youre a joke For Heavens sake
use a little commonsense yourself You cant be warning me that my
lover is marrying me in order to use his fists on me

Perhaps not dearthe artist smiled there might be greater depths
for one of your training and character Im just telling you the plain
truth about the haste with which youre rushing into this marriage
Theres nothing divine in it Theres no true romance of lofty
sentiment Its the simplest and most elemental of all the brutal facts
of animal life That it is resistless in a woman of your culture and
refinement makes it all the more pathetic

The girl rose with a gesture of impatience

Its no use Jane dear we speak a different language I dont in the
least know what youre talking about and whats more Im glad I dont
Ive a vague idea that your drift is indecent But were different I
realize that I dont sit in judgment on you Youre wasting your breath
on me Im going into this marriage with my eyes wide open Its the
fulfillment of my brightest hopes and aspirations That I shall be happy
with this man and make him supremely happy I know by an intuition
deeper and truer than reason Im going to trust that intuition without
reservation

All right honey the artist agreed with a smile I wont say
anything more except that youre fooling yourself about the depth of
this intuitive knowledge Your infatuation is not based on the verdict
of your deepest and truest instincts

On what then

The crazy ideals of the novels youve been readingthats all

Ridiculous

Youre absolutely sure for instance that God made just one man the
mate of one woman arent you

As sure as that I live

Where did you learn it

So long ago I cant remember

Not in your Bible

No

The Sunday school

No

Craddock didnt tell you that did he

Hardly

I thought not He has too much horsesense in spite of his emotional
gymnastics You learned it in the first dimenovel you read

I never read a dimenovel in my life she interrupted indignantly

I knowyou paid a dollar and a quarter for itbut it was a
dimenovel The philosophy of this school of trash you have built into
a creed of life How can you be so blind How can you make so tragic a
blunder

Thats just it Jane I couldnt if your impressions of his character
were true I couldnt make a mistake about so vital a question I
couldnt love him if he really were a coarse illiterate brute What you
see is only on the surface He hasnt had his chance yet

Who is he What does he do Who are his people

He has no people

I thought not

I love him all the more deeply she went on firmly because of his
miserable childhood Ill do my best to make up for the years of cruelty
and hunger and suffering through which he passed What right have you
to sit in judgment on him without a hearing Youve known him two
hours

Jane shrugged her shoulders

Two minutes was quite enough

And you judge by what standard

My five senses and my sixth sense above all One look at his square
bulldog jaw his massive neck and the deformity of his delicate hands
and feet I hear the ignorant patois of the East Side underworld
I smell the brimstone in his suppressed rage at my dislike Theres
something uncanny in the sensuous droop of his heavy eyelids and the
glitter of his steelblue eyes Theres something incongruous in his
whole personality I was afraid of him the moment I saw him

Mary broke into hysterical laughter

And if my five senses and my intuitions contradict yours Who is to
decide If I loved him on sightIf I looked into his eyes and saw
the soul of my mate If their cold fires thrill me with inexpressible
passion If I see in his massive neck and jaw the strength of an
irresistible manhood the power to win success and to command the
world If I see in his slender hands and small feet lines of exquisite
beautyam I to crush my senses and strangle my love to please your
idiotic prejudice

Jane threw up her hands in despair

Certainly not If youre blind and deaf I cant keep you from
committing suicide Id lock you up in an asylum for the insane if I had
the power to save you from the clutches of the brute

Mary drew herself erect and faced her friend

Please dont repeat that word in my hearingtheres a limit to
friendship I think youd better go

Jane rose and walked quickly to the door her lips pressed firmly

As you likeour lives will be far apart from tonight Its just as
well

She closed the door with a bang and reached the head of the stairs
before Mary threw her arms around her neck

Please dear forgive medont go in anger

The older woman kissed her tenderly glad of the dim light to hide her
own tears

There its all right honeyI wont remember it Forgive me for my
ugly words

I love him JaneI love him Its Fate Cant you understand

Yes dear I understand and Ill love you alwaysgoodby

Youll come to my wedding

Perhaps

Ill let you know

Another kiss and Jane Anderson strode down the stairs and out into the
night with a sickening helpless fear in her heart




CHAPTER VIII JIMS TRIAL

The quarrel had left Mary in a quiver of exalted rage How dare a friend
trample her most sacred feelings She pitied Jane Anderson and her
tribethese modern feminine leaders of a senseless revolution against
manthey were crazy They had all been disappointed in some individual
and for that reason set themselves up as the judges of mankind

Thank God my soul has not been poisoned she exclaimed aloud with
fervor How strange that these women who claim such clear vision can be
so stupidly blind

She busied herself with her little household and made up her mind once
and for all time to be done with such friendships The friendship of
such women was a vain thing They were vicious cats at heartnot like
her gentle Persian kitten whose soul was full of sleepy sunlight These
modern insurgents were wild halfstarved stray cats that had been
hounded and beaten until they had lapsed into their elemental brute
instincts They were so aggravating too they deserved no sympathy

Again she thanked God that she was not one of themthat her heart was
still capable of romantic lovea love so sudden and so overwhelming
that it could sweep life before it in one mad rush to its glorious end

She woke next morning with a dull sense of depression The room was damp
and chilly It was storming The splash of rain against the window and
the muffled roar from the street below meant that the wind was high and
the day would be a wretched one outside

They couldnt take their ride

It was a double disappointment She had meant to have him dash down to
Long Beach and place the ring on her finger seated on that same bright
sanddune overlooking the sea Instead they must stay indoors Jim was
not at his best indoors She loved him behind the wheel with his hand
on the pulse of that racer The machine seemed a part of his being He
breathed his spirit into its steel heart and together they swept her on
and on over billowy clouds through the gates of Heaven

There was no help for it They would spend the time together in her room
planning the future It would be sweetthese intimate hours in her home
with the man she loved

Should she spend a whole day alone there with him Was it just proper
Was it really safe Nonsense The vile thoughts which Jane had uttered
had poisoned her after all She hated her self that she could remember
them And yet they filled her heart with dread in spite of every effort
to laugh them off

How could Jane Anderson dare say such things she muttered angrily
A coarse illiterate brute Its a lie a lie a lie She stamped
her foot in rage Hes strong and brave and masterfula man among
menhes my mate and I love him

And yet the frankness with which her friend had spoken had in reality
disturbed her beyond measure Through every hour of the day her
uneasiness increased After all she was utterly alone and her life
had been pitifully narrow Her knowledge of men she had drawn almost
exclusively from romantic fiction

It was just a little strange that Jim persisted in living so completely
in the present and the future He had told her of his pitiful childhood
He had told her of his business It had been definitethe simple
statement he madeand she accepted it without question until Jane
Anderson had dropped these ugly suspicions She hated the meddler for
it

In the light of such suspicions the simplest bravest man might seem a
criminal How could her friend be blind to the magnetism of this mans
powerful personality Bah She was jealous of their perfect happiness
Why are women so contemptible

She began a careful study of every trait of her lovers character
determined to weigh him by the truest standards of manhood Certainly
he was no weakling The one abomination of her soul was the type of the
city degenerate she saw simpering along Broadway and Fifth Avenue at
times Jim was brave to the point of rashness No man with an ounce of
cowardice in his being could handle a car in every crisis with such cool
daring and perfect control He was strong He could lift her body as if
it were a feather His arms crushed her with terrible force He could
earn a living for them both There could be no doubt about that His
faultless clothes the ease with which he commanded unlimited credit
among the automobile manufacturers and dealersevery supply store on
Broadway seemed to know himleft no doubt on that score

There was just a bit of mystery and reserve about his career as an
inventor His first success that had given him a start he had not
explained The big deal about the new carburetor she could of course
understand He had a workshop all his own He had told her this the
first day they met She would ask him to take her to see it this
afternoon The storm would prevent the trip to the Beach She would ask
this not because she doubted his honesty but because she really wished
to see the place in which he worked It was her workshop now as well as
his

For a moment her suspicions were sickening Suppose he had romanced
about his workshop and his room Supposed he lived somewhere in the
squalid slums of the lower East Side and his people after all were
alive Perhaps a drunken father and a coarse brutal motherand
sisters

She stopped with a frown and clenched her fists

She would ask Jim to show her his workshop That would be enough If
he had told her the truth about that she would make up to him in tender
abandonment of utter trust for every suspicion she harbored

The car was standing in front of her door He waved for her to come
down

Jump right in he called gayly Ive got an extra rubber blanket for
you

In the storm Jim she faltered

Surest thing you know Its great to fly through a storm You can just
ride on its wings Throw on your raincoat and come on quick Im going
to run down to the Beach Whos afraid of an old storm with this thing
under us

Her heart gave a bound Her longing had reached her lover and brought
him through the storm to do her bidding It was wonderfulthis oneness
of soul and body

She was happy againsupremely divinely happy The man by her side knew
and understood She knew and understood She loved this daring spirit
that rose to the windthis iron will that brooked no interference with
his plans even from Nature when it crossed his love

The sting of the raindrops against her cheek was exhilarating The car
glided over the swimming roadway like a great gray gull skimming the
beach at low tide Her soul rose The sun of a perfect faith and love
was shining now behind the clouds

She nestled close to his side and watched him tenderly from the corners
of her halfclosed eyes her whole being content in his strength The
idea of dashing through a blinding rain to the Beach on such a day would
have been to her mind an unthinkable piece of madness She was proud
of his daring It would be hers to shield from the storms of life She
loved the rugged lines of his massive jaw in profile How could Jane be
such a fool as to call him ugly

The weather of course prevented them from walking up the Beach to
their sanddune The walk would have been all rightbut it was out
of the question to sit down there and give her the ring in the pouring
rain She knew this as well as he She knew too that he had the ring
in his pocket though he had carefully refrained from referring to it in
any way

He led her to a secluded nook behind a pillar in the little parlor The
hotel was deserted They had the building almost to themselves A log
fire crackled in the open fireplace and he drew a settee close The
wind had moderated and the rain was pouring down in straight streams
rolling in soft music on the roof

He drew the ring from his pocket Well Kiddo I got it The fellow
said this was all right

He held the tiny gold band before her shining eyes

Slip it on she whispered

Which one

This one silly

She extended her third finger as he pressed the ring slowly on

Seems to me a mighty little one and a mighty cheap one but he said it
was the thing

Its all right dear she whispered Kiss me

He pressed his lips to hers and held them until she sank back and lifted
her hand in warning

Be careful

Whose afraid Jim muttered glancing over his shoulder toward the
door Now tell me what daytomorrow

Nonsense man she cried Give me time to breathe

What for

Just to realize that Im engagedto plan and think and dream of the
wonderful day

Were losing time

Well never live these wonderful hours over again dear

Jims face fell and his voice was pitiful in its funereal notes Lord
I thought the ring settled it

And so it does dearit does

Not if that longlegged spider that took dinner with us the other night
gets in her fine work Ill bet that she handed me a few when you got
home

Mary was silent

Now didnt she

To the best of her abilityyesbut I didnt mind her silly talk

Gee but Id love to give her a bouquet of poison ivy

We had an awful quarrel

And you stood up for me

You know I did

All right I dont give a tinkers damn what anybody says if you stand
by me In all this world theres just youfor me Theres never been
anybody elseand there never will be Im that kind

And I love you for it she cried with rapture pressing his hand in
both of hers

What did she say about me anyhow

Nothing worth repeating Ive forgotten it

Jim held her gaze

Its funny how you love anybody the minute you lay eyes on emor hate
em the same way I wanted to choke her the minute she opened her yap to
me

Forget it dear she broke in briskly I want you to take me to see
your workshop tomorrowwill you

A flash of suspicion shot from the depths of his eyes

Did she tell you to ask me that

Of course not Im just interested in everything you do I want to see
where you work

Its no place for a sweet girl to gothat part of town

But Ill be with you

I dont want you to go down there he sullenly maintained

But why dear

Its a low dirty place I had to locate the shop there to get the room
I needed for the rent I could pay Its not fit for you Im going to
move uptown in a little while

Please let me go she pleaded

He shook his head emphatically

No

She turned away to hide the tears The first real hideous fear she had
ever had about him caught her heart in spite of every effort to fight it
down His workshop might be a myth after all He had failed in the first
test to which she had put him It was horrible All the vile suggestions
of Jane Anderson rushed now into her memory

She struggled bravely to keep her head and not break down It was beyond
her strength A sob strangled her and she buried her face in her hands

Jim looked at her in helpless anguish for a moment started to gather
her in his arms and looked around the room in terror

He leaned over her and whispered tensely

For Gods sake Kiddodontdont do that I didnt mean to hurt
youhonest I didnt Dont cry any more and Ill take you right down
to the black hole and let you sleep on the floor if you want to Gee
Ill give you the whole place tools junk and all

She lifted her head

Will you Jim

Sure I will We start this minute if you want to go

She glanced over his shoulder to see that no one was looking threw her
arms around his neck and kissed him again and again

It was the first time you ever said no dear and it hurt Im happy
again now If youll just let me see you in the shop for five minutes
Ill never ask you again

All righttomorrow when you get out of school Ill take you down
Holy Mike that was a dandy kiss Lets quarrel againstart something
else

She rose laughing and brushed the last trace of tears from her eyes

Lets eat dinner nowIm hungry

By George Id forgot all about the feed

By eight oclock the storm had abated the rain suddenly stopped and
the moon peeped through the clouds

He drove the big racer back at a steady even stride on her lowest notch
of speedhalf the time with only his right hand on the wheel and his
left gripping hers

As the lights of Manhattan flashed from the hills beyond the
Queensborough Bridge he leaned close and whispered

Happy

Perfectly

The car was waiting the next day at halfpast three

Its not far he said nodding carelessly You neednt put on the
coat Be there in a jiffy

Down Twentythird Street to Avenue A down the avenue to Eighteenth
Street and then he suddenly swung the machine through Eighteenth into
Avenue B and stopped below a low red brick building on the corner

He set his brakes with a crash leaped out and extended his hands

I didnt like to take you up these stairs at the back of that saloon
little girl but you would come Now dont blame me

She pressed his arm tenderly

Of course I wont blame you Im proud and happy to share your life and
help you Im surprised to see everything so quiet down here I thought
all the East Side was packed with crowded tenements

No he answered in a matteroffact way About the only excitement
we have in this quarter is an occasional gas explosion in the plant over
there and the noise of the secondhand material men unloading iron The
tenements havent been built here yet

He led her quickly past the back door of the saloon and up two narrow
flights of stairs to the top of the building drew from his pocket the
key to a heavy padlock and slipped the crooked bolt from the double
staples He unlocked the door with a second key and pushed his way in

All righto he cried

The straight narrow hall inside was dark He fumbled in his pocket and
lit the gas

The workshop first or my sleeping den

The workshop first she whispered excitedly

She had made the reality of this shop the supreme test of Jims word
and character She was in a fever of expectant uncertainty as to its
equipment and practical use

He unlocked the door leading to the front

Thats my denwell come back here

He passed quickly to the further end of the hall and again used two keys
to open the door and held it back for her to enter

Im sorry its so dirtyif you get your pretty dress all ruinedits
not my fault you know

Mary surveyed the room with an exclamation of delight

Oh what a wonderful place Why Jim youre a magician

There could be no doubt about the practical use to which the shop was
being put Its one small window opened on a fire escape in the narrow
court in the rear A skylight in the middle opened with a hinge on the
roof and flooded the space with perfect light An iron ladder swung from
the skylight and was hooked up against the ceiling by a hasp fastened
to a staple over a workbench On one side of the room was a tiny
blacksmiths forge an anvil hammers and a complete set of tools for
working in rough iron A small gasoline engine supplied the power which
turned his lathe and worked the drills saw and plane On the other
side of the room was arranged a fairly complete chemical laboratory with
several retorts and an oxyhydrogen blowpipe capable of developing the
powerful heat used in the melting and brazing of metals Beneath the
benches were piled automobile supplies of every kind

You know how to use all these machines Jim she asked in wonder

Sure and then some he answered with a wave of his slender hand

Youre a wizard

Now the den he said briskly

She followed him through the hall and into the large front corner room
overlooking Avenue B and Eighteenth Street The morning sun flooded the
front and the afternoon sun poured into the side windows The furniture
was solid mahoganya bed bureau chiffonier couch and three chairs
The windows were fitted with woodpaneled shutters shades and heavy
draperies A thick soft carpet of faded red covered the floor

Its a nice room Jim but Id like to dust it for you she said with
a smile

Sure Im for giving you the right to dust it every morning Kiddo
beginning now Lets find a preacher tonight

She blushed and moved a step toward the door

Just a little while You know its been only ten days since we met

But weve lived some in that time havent we

An eternity I think she said reverently

I want to marry right now girlie he pleaded desperately If that
spider gets you in her den again I just feel like its good night for
me

Nonsense You cant believe me such a silly child Im a woman I love
you Do you think the foolish prejudice of a friend could destroy my
love for the man whom I have chosen for my mate

No but I want it fixed and then its fixedand they can say what
they please Marry me tonight Youve got the ring Youre going to in a
little while anyhow Whats the use to wait and lose these days out of
our life Whats the sense of it Dont you know me by this time Dont
you trust me by this time

She slipped her hand gently into his

I trust you utterly And I feel that Ive known you since the day I was
born

Then whywhy wait a minute

You cant understand a girls feelings dearonly a little while and
its all right

He sat down on the couch in silence rose and walked to the window She
watched him struggling with deep emotion

He turned suddenly

Look here Kiddo Ive got to leave on that trip to the mountains of
North Carolina Ive got to get down there before Christmas I must be
back here by the first of the year GeeI cant go without you You
dont want to stay here without me do you

A sudden pallor overspread her face For the first time she realized how
their lives had become one in the sweet intimacy of the past ten days

You must go now she gasped

Yes Ive made my arrangements Ive business back here the first
of the year that cant wait Marry me and go with me Well take our
honeymoon down there By George well go together in the car Every day
by each others side over hundreds and hundreds of miles Say aint you
game Come on Its a crime to send me away without you How can you do
it

I cantIm afraid she faltered

Youll marry me then

Yes she whispered What is the latest day you can start

Next Saturday if we go in the car

All rightshe was looking straight into the depths of his soul
nownext Saturday

He clasped her in his arms and held her with desperate tenderness




CHAPTER IX ELLAS SECRET

The consummation of her lifes dream was too near too sweet and
wonderful for Janes croakings to distress Mary Adams beyond the moment
She had of course wished her friend to be present at the weddingyet
the curt refusal had only aroused anew her pity at stupid prejudices
It was out of the question to ask her father to leave his work in the
Kentucky mountains and come all the way to New York She would surprise
him with the announcement After all she was the one human being
vitally concerned in this affair and the only one save the man whose
life would be joined to hers

In five minutes after the painful scene with Jane she had completely
regained her composure and her face was radiant with happiness when
she waved to Jim He was standing before the door in the car waiting to
take her to the City Hall to get the marriage license

Gee he cried youre the prettiest sweetest thing that ever walked
this earth with those cheeks all flaming like a rose Are you happy

Gloriously

She motioned him to keep his seat and sprang lightly to his side

Arent you happy sir she added gayly

I am yesbut to tell you the truth Im beginning to get scared You
know what to do dont you when we get before that preacher

Of course silly

I never saw a wedding in my life

She pressed his hand tenderly

Honestly Jim

I swear it Youll have to tell me how to behave

Well rehearse it all tonight Ill show you Ive seen hundreds of
people married My fathers a preacher you know

Yes I know that he went on solemnly thats what gives me courage
I knew youd understand everything Im counting on you Kiddoif you
fall down were gone Ill run like a turkey

Its easy she laughed

And this license businesshow do we go about that Whatll they do to
us

Nothing goose We just march up to the clerk and demand the license
He asks us a lot of questions

Questions What sort of questions

The names of your father and motherwhether youve been married before
and where you live and how old you are

Ask you about your business he interrupted sharply

No They think if you can pay the license fee you can support your
wife I suppose

How much is it

I dont know here It used to be two dollars in Kentucky

Thats cheapmust come higher in this burg I brought along a
hundred

Nonsense

Theres a lot of graft in this town Ill be ready Ive got to get
emdont care how high they come

Therell be no graft in this Jim she protested gayly

Well itll be the first time I ever got by without itbelieve me

The ease with which the license was obtained was more than Jim could
understand All the way back from the City Hall he expected to be held
up at every corner He kept looking over his shoulder to see if they
were being followed

Arrived in her room they discussed their plans for the day of days

Ill come round soon in the morning and well spend the whole day at
the Beach he suggested

She lifted her hands in protest

Nono

No

Not on our weddingday Jim

Why

Its not good form The groom should not see the bride that day until
they meet at the altar

Lets change it

No sir the old ways the best Ill spend the day in saying goodby
to the past Youll call for me at six oclock Well go to Dr
Craddocks house and be married in time for our wedding dinner

The lover smiled and his drooping eyelids fell still lower as he
watched her intently

I want that dinner here in this little place Kiddo

She blushed and protested

I thought wed go to the Beach and spend the night there

Here girlie here I love this little placeits so like you Get
the old wildcat who cleans up for you to fix us a dinner here all by
ourselveswouldnt she

Shed do anything for meyes

Then fix it hereI want to be just with youdont you understand

Yes she whispered But Id rather spend that first day of our new
life in a strange placeand the Beach we both lovehadnt you just as
leave go there Jim

No The waiters will stare at us and hear us talk

We can have our meals served in our room

This is better he insisted I want to spend one day here alone with
you before we gojust to feel that youre all mine You see if I walk
in here and own the place Ill know that better than any other way
Ive just set my heart on it Kiddowhats the difference

She lifted her lips to his

All right dear It shall be as you wish Tomorrow I will be all
yoursin life in death in eternity Your happiness will be the one
thing for which I shall plan and work

Ella was very happy in the honor conferred on her She was given entire
charge of the place and spent the day in feverish preparation for the
dinner She insisted on borrowing a larger table from the little fat
woman next door to hold the extra dishes She dressed herself in her
best Her raven black hair was pressed smooth and shining down the sides
of her pale temples

The work was completed by three oclock in the afternoon and Mary lay
in her window lazily watching the crowds scurrying home The offices
closed early on Saturday afternoons

Ella was puttering about the room adding little touches here and there
in a pretense of still being busy As a matter of fact she was watching
the girl from her one eye with a wistful tenderness she had not dared
as yet to express in words Twice Mary had turned suddenly and seen her
thus Each time Ella had started as if caught in some act of mischief
and asked an irrelevant question to relieve her embarrassment

Mary could feel her single eye fixed on her now in a deep brooding
look It made her uncomfortable

She turned slowly and spoke in gentle tones

Youve been so sweet to me today Ellafather and mother and best
friend Ill never forget your kindness Youd better rest awhile now
until we go to Dr Craddocks I want you to be there too

To see the marriageja she asked softly

Yes

Oh no my dear noI stay here and wait for you to come I keep the
lights burning bright I welcome the bride and groom to their little
homeja

A quick glance of suspicion shot from Marys blue eyes Could it be
possible that this forlorn scrubwoman would carry her hostility to her
lover to the same point of ungracious refusal to witness the ceremony
It was nonsense of course Ella would feel out of place in the
ministers parlor that was all She wouldnt insist

All right Ella you can receive us here with ceremony Youll be our
maid butler my father my mother and my friends

There was a moments silence and still no move on Ellas part to go The
girl felt her single eye again fixed on her in mysterious wistful
gaze She would send her away if it were possible without hurting her
feelings

Mary lifted her eyes suddenly and Ella stirred awkwardly and smiled

I hope you are very happy meine liebeja

I couldnt be happier if I were in Heaven was the quick answer

Im so glad

Again an awkward pause

I was once young and pretty like you meine liebe she began dreamily
slim and straight and jollyalways laughing

Mary held her breath in eager expectancy Ella was going to lift the
veil from the mystery of her life stirred by memories which the coming
wedding had evoked

And you had a thrilling romanceElla I always felt it

Again silence and then in low tones the woman told her story

Jaa romance too I was so young and foolishjust a baby myselfnot
sixteen But I was full of life and fun and I had a way of doing what I
pleased

The man was older than meOh a lot olderwith gray hairs on the side
of his head I was wild about him I never took to kids They didnt
seem to like me

She paused as if hesitating to give her full confidence and quickly
went on

My folks were German They couldnt speak English I learned when I was
five years old They didnt like my lover We quarrel day and night I
say they didnt like him because they could not speak his language They
say he was bad I fight for him and run away and marry him

Again she paused and drew a deep breath

Ah I was one happy little fool that year He make good wages on the
docksa stevedore They had a strike and he got to drinking The baby
came

She stopped suddenly

You had a little baby Ella the girl asked in a tender whisper

Jaja she sobbedso sweet so goodso quietso beautiful she was
I was very happylike a little girl with a dollonly she laugh and
cry and coo and pull my hair He stop the drink a little while when she
come and he got work And then he begin worse and worse It seem like
he never loved me any more after the baby He curse me he quarrel He
begin to strike me sometimes I laugh and cry at first and make up and
try again

Again she paused as if for courage to go on and choked into silence

Yesand then the girl asked

And then he come home one night wild drunk He stumble and fall
across the cradle and hurt my baby so she never cryjust lie still and
trembleher eyes wide open at first and then they droop and close and
she die

He laugh and curse and strike me and I fight him like a tiger He was
stronghe throw me down on the floor and gouge my eye out with his big
claw

Oh my God Mary sobbed

Ella sprang to her feet and bent over the girl with trembling eagerness

You keep my secret meine liebe

Yesyes

I never tell a soul on earth what I tell you nowI just eat my heart
out and keep still all the years I can tell youja

Yes Ill keep it sacredgo on

When I know he gouge my eye out I go wild I get my hand on his throat
and choke him still I drag him to the stairs and throw him head first
all the way down to the bottom He fall in a heap and lie still I run
down and drag him to the door I kick his face and he never move He was
dead I kick him againand again And then I laughI laughI laugh in
his dead faceI was so glad I kill him

She sank in a paroxysm of sobs on the floor and the girl touched her
smooth black hair tenderly strangled with her own emotions

Ella rose at last and brushed the tears from her hollow cheeks

Now you know meine liebe Why I tell you this today I dont
knowmaybe I must I dream once like you dream today

The girl slipped her arms around the drooping pathetic figure and
stroked it tenderly

The sunshine is for some maybe Ella went on pathetically for some
the clouds and the storms I hope you are very very happy today and all
the days

I will be Ella Im sure Ill always love you after this

Maybe I make you sad because I tell you

Nono Im glad you told me The knowledge of your sorrow will make my
life the sweeter I shall be more humble in my joy

It never occurred to the girl for a moment that this lonely broken
woman had torn her souls deepest secret open in a last pathetic effort
to warn her of the danger of her marriage The wistful helpless look
in her eye meant to Mary only the anguish of memories Each human heart
persists in learning the big lessons of life at first hand We refuse to
learn any other way The tragedies of others interest us as fiction We
make the application to othersnever to ourselves

Jims familiar footstep echoed through the hall and Mary sprang to the
door with a cry of joy




CHAPTER X THE WEDDING

Ella hurried into the kitchenette and busied herself with dinner Jims
unexpectedly early arrival broke the spell of the tragedy to which Mary
had listened with breathless sympathy Her own future she faced without
a shadow of doubt or fear

Her reproaches to Jim were entirely perfunctory on the sin of his early
call on their weddingday

Naughty boy she cried with mock severity At this unseemly hour

He glanced about the room nervously

Anybody in there

He nodded toward the kitchenette

Only Ella

Send her away

Whats the matter

Quick Kiddoquick

Mary let Ella out from the little private hall without her seeing Jim
and returned

For heavens sake man what ails you she asked excitedly

SayI forgot that thing already We got to go over it again What if I
miss it

The ceremony

Yep

He mopped his brow and looked at his watch

By the time we get to that preachers house I wont know my first name
if you dont help me

Mary laughed softly and kissed him

You cant miss it All youve got to do is say I will when he asks
you the question put the ring on my finger when he tells you and
repeat the words after himhe and I will do the rest

Say my question over again

Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife to live together after
Gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony Wilt thou love
her comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health and
forsaking all others keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall
live

She looked at him and laughed

Why dont you answer

Now

Yesthats the end of the question Say I will

Oh I will all right What scares me is that Ill jump in on him and
say I will before he gets halfway through Seems to me when he says
Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife Ill just have to
choke myself there to keep from saying You bet your life I will
Parson

It wont hurt anything if you say I will several times she assured
him

It wouldnt queer the job

Not in the least Ive often heard them say I will two or three
times Wait until you hear the words so long as ye both shall
live

So long as ye both shall live he repeated solemnly

The other speech you say after the minister

He wont bite off more than I can chew at one time will he

No sillyjust a few words

Because if he does Ill choke

Jim drew his watch again mopped his brow and gazed at Marys serene
face with wonder

Say Kiddo youre immenseyoure as cool as a cucumber

Of course Why not Its my day of joy and perfect peacethe day Ive
dreamed of since the dawn of maidenhood Im marrying the man of
my choicethe one man God made for me of all men on earth I know
thisIm content

Let me hang around here till timewont you he asked helplessly

We must have Ella come back to fix the table

Sure I just didnt want her to hear me tell you that I had cold feet
Im better now

Ella moved about the room with soft tread watching Jim with sullen
concentrated gaze when he was not looking

The lovers sat on the couch beside the window holding each others
hands and watching in silence the hurrying crowds pass below Now that
his panic was over Jim began to breathe more freely and the time
swiftly passed

As the shadows slowly fell they rang the bell at the parsons house
beside the church and his good wife ushered them into the parlor The
little Craddocks crowded insix of them two girls and four boys their
ages ranging from five to nineteen

Sweet memories crowded the girls heart from her happy childhood She
had never missed one of these affairs at home Her father was a very
popular minister and his home the Mecca of lovers for miles around

Craddock like her father was inclined to be conservative in his forms
Marriage he held with the old theologians to be a holy sacrament He
never used the newfangled marriage vows He stuck to the formula of the
Book of Common Prayer

When she stood before the preacher in this beautiful familiar scene
which she had witnessed so many times at home Marys heart beat with a
joy that was positively silly She tried to be serious and the dimple
would come in her cheek in spite of every effort

As Craddocks musical voice began the opening address the memory of a
foolish incident in her fathers life flashed through her mind and
she wondered if Jim in his excitement had forgotten his pocketbook and
couldnt pay the preacher

Dearly beloved he began we are gathered together here in the sight
of God

Mary tried to remember that she was in the sight of God but she was so
foolishly happy she could only remember that funny scene A longlegged
Kentucky mountain bridegroom at the close of the ceremony had turned to
her father and drawled

Well parson I aint got no money with mebut I want to give ye five
dollars Ive got a fine dawg Hes worth ten Ill send him to ye fur
fiveif its all right

The children had giggled and her father blushed

Oh thats all right he had answered Moneys no matter Forget the
five I hope youll be very happy

Two weeks later a crate containing the dog had come by express On the
tag was scrawled


Dear ParsonI like Nancy so well I send ye the hole dawg anyhow


She hadnt a doubt that Jim would feel the same waybut she hoped he
hadnt forgotten his pocketbook

The scene had flashed through her mind in a single moment She had
bitten her lips and kept from laughing by a supreme effort Not a word
of the solemn ceremonial however had escaped her consciousness

And in the face of this company the preachers rich voice was saying
to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony which is
commended of St Paul to be honorable among all men and therefore is
not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently
discreetly advisedly soberly and in the fear of God Into this holy
estate these two persons present come now to be joined If any man can
show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him
now speak or else hereafter for ever hold his peace

Craddock paused and his piercing eyes searched the man and woman before
him

I require to charge you both as ye will answer at the dreadful day
of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed that
if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined
together in Matrimony ye do now confess it

Again he paused The perspiration stood in beads on Jims forehead and
he glanced uneasily at Mary from the corners of his drooping eyes A
smile was playing about her mouth and Jim was cheered

For be ye well assured the preacher continued that if any persons
are joined together otherwise than as Gods Word doth allow their
marriage is not lawful

He turned with deliberation to Jim and transfixed him with the first
question of the ceremony The groom was hypnotized into a state of
abject terror His ears heard the words the mind recorded but the
vaguest idea of what they meant

Wilt thou have this Woman to thy wedded wife to live together after
Gods ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony Wilt thou love her
comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health and
forsaking all others keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall
live

Jims mouth was open his lower jaw had dropped in dazed awe and he
continued to stare straight into the preachers face until Mary pressed
his arm and whispered

Jim

I willyes I willyou bet I will he hastened to answer

The children giggled and the preachers lips twitched

He turned quickly to Mary

Wilt thou have this Man to thy wedded husband to live together after
Gods ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony Wilt thou obey him
and serve him love honor and keep him in sickness and in health and
forsaking all others keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall
live

With quick clear voice Mary answered

I will

Please join your right hands and repeat after me

He fixed Jim with his gaze and spoke with deliberation clause by
clause

I James take thee Mary to my wedded wife to have and to hold from
this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in
sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death us do part
according to Gods holy ordinance and thereto I plight thee my troth

Jims throat at first was husky with fear but he caught each clause
with quick precision and repeated them without a hitch

He smiled and congratulated himself I got ye that time old cull

The preachers eyes sought Marys

I Mary take thee James to my wedded husband to have and to hold
from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in
sickness and in health to love cherish and to obey till death do
us part according to Gods holy ordinance and thereto I give thee my
troth

In the sweetest musical voice quivering with happiness the girl
repeated the words

Again the preachers eyes sought Jims

AND THE MAN SHALL GIVE UNTO THE WOMAN A RING

The groom fumbled in his pocket and found at last the ring which he
handed to Mary The minister at once took it from her hand and handed it
back to Jim

The bride lifted her left hand deftly extending the fourth finger and
the groom slipped the ring on and held it firmly gripped as he had been
instructed

With this ring I thee wed

With this ring I thee wed Jim repeated firmly

and with all my worldly goods I thee endow

and with all my worldly goods I thee endow

In the Name of the Father

In the Name of the Father

and of the Son

and of the Son

and of the Holy Ghost

and of the Holy Ghost

Amen

Amen

The voice of the preachers prayer that followed rang faraway and
unreal to the heart of the girl Her vivid imagination had leaped the
years Her spirit did not return to earth and time and place until the
minister seized her right hand and joined it to Jims

Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder

Forasmuch as James Anthony and Mary Adams have consented together in
holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and this company
and thereto have given and pledged their troth each to the other and
have declared the same by giving and receiving a Ring and by joining
hands I pronounce that they are Man and Wife In the Name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Amen

The preacher lifted his hands solemnly above their heads

God the Father God the Son God the Holy Ghost bless preserve and
keep you the Lord mercifully with His favor look upon you and fill you
with all spiritual benediction and grace that ye may so live together
in this life that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting
AMEN

The preacher took Marys hand

Your father is my friend child This is for him

He bent quickly and kissed her lips while Jim gasped in astonishment

The ministers wife congratulated them both The two older children
smilingly advanced and added their voices in good wishes

Mary whispered to Jim

Dont forget the preachers fee

Lord how much Will fifty be enough Its all Ive got

Give him twenty Well need the rest

It was not until they were seated in the waiting cab and sank back among
the shadows that Jim crushed her in his arms and kissed her until she
cried for mercy

The gall of that preacher kissing you he muttered savagely You
know I come within an ace of pasting him one on the nose




CHAPTER XI UNTIL DEATH

The lights burned in the hall with unusual brightness Ella stood in the
open door of the room through which the light was streaming With its
radiance came the perfume of rosesthe scrubwomans gift of love The
room was a bower of gorgeous flowers She had spent her last cent in
this extravagance Mary swept the place with a look of amazement

Oh Ella she cried how could you be so silly

You like them ja Ella asked softly

Theyre gloriousbut you should not have made such a sacrifice for
me

For myself maybe I do itall for myself to make me happy too
tonight

She dismissed the subject with a wave of her hand and placed the chairs
beside the beautifully set table

Dinner is all ready she announced cheerfully And shall I go now and
leave you Or will you let me serve your dinner first

A sudden panic seized the bride

Stay and serve the dinner Ella if you will she quickly answered

Jim frowned but seated himself in businesslike fashion

All right Im ready for it old girl

With soft tread and swift deft touch Ella served the dinner standing
prim and stiff and ghostlike behind Jims chair between the courses

The bride watched her fascinated by the pallor of her haggard face and
the queer suggestion of Death which her appearance made in spite of the
background of flowers She had dressed herself in a simple skirt and
shirtwaist of spotless white The material seemed to be draped on her
tall figure thin to emaciation The chalklike pallor of her face
brought out with startling sharpness the deep hollow caverns beneath
her straight eyebrows Her single eye shone unusually bright

Gradually the grim impression grew that Death was hovering over her
bridal feasta foolish fancy which persisted in her highlywrought
nervous state Yet the idea once fixed could not be crushed In
vain she used her will to bring her wandering mind back to the joyous
present Each time she lifted her eyes they rested upon the silent
white figure with its single eye piercing the depths of her soul

She could endure it no longer She nodded and smiled wanly at Ella

You may go now

The woman gazed at the bride in surprise

I shall come againyes

Tomorrow morning Ella you may help me

The white figure paused uncertainly at the door and her drawling voice
breathed her parting word tenderly

Good night

The bride closed her eyes and answered

Good night Ella

The door closed Jim rose quickly and bolted it

Thank God he exclaimed fervently He fixed his slumbering eyes on his
wife for a moment saw the frightened look walked quickly back to the
table and took his seat

Now Kiddo we can eat in peace

Yes Id rather be alone she sighed

I must say Jim went on briskly that parson of yours did give us a
run for our money

I like the old long ceremony best

Well you see I aint never had much choicebut do you know what I
thought was the best thing in it

Nowhat

UNTIL DEATH DO US PART Gee how he did ring out on that His voice
sounded to me like a big bell somewhere away up in the clouds Did you
hear me sing it back at him

Mary smiled nervously

You had found your voice then

You bet I had I muffed that first one though didnt I

A little It didnt matter She answered mechanically

He fixed his eyes on her again

Hungry Kiddo

No she gasped

Whats the use he cried in low vibrant tones springing to his feet
I dont want to eat this stuffI just want to eat you

Mary rose tremblingly and moved instinctively to meet him

He clasped her form in his arms and crushed with cruel strength

Until death do us part he whispered passionately

She answered with a kiss




CHAPTER XII THE LOTOSEATERS

It was eleven oclock next morning before Ella ventured to rap softly
on the door They had just finished breakfast The bride was clearing up
the table humming a song of her childhood

Jim caught her in his arms

Once more before she comes

Dont kill me she laughed

Jim lounged in the window and smoked his cigarette while Ella and Mary
chattered in the kitchenette

In half an hour the scrubwoman had made her last trip with the extra
dishes and the little home was spick and span

Mary sprang on the couch and snuggled into Jims arms

Ive changed our plans he began thoughtfully

We wont give up our honeymoon trip she cried in alarm Thats one
dream we MUST live Jim dear Ive set my heart on it

Sure we willsure he answered quickly But not in that car

Why

Jim grinned

Because I like you betteryou get me Kiddo

She pressed close and whispered

I think so

You see that fool car might throw a tire or two Believe me itll
be a job to have her on my hands for a thousand miles Of course if I
didnt know you little girl it would be all sorts of fun But honest
to God this game beats the world

He bent low and kissed her again

Wherell we go then she murmured

Thats what Im tryin to dope out I like the sea It lulls me just
like whisky puts a drunkard to sleep I wish we could get where its
bright and warm and the sun shines all the time We could stay two
weeks and then jump on the train and be in Asheville the day before
Christmas

Mary sprang up excitedly

I have it Well go to Floridaaway down to the Keys Its the dream
of my life to go there

The Keys whats that he asked puzzled

The Keys are little sand islands and reefs that jut out into the warm
waters of the Gulf of Mexico The railroad takes us right there

Its warm and sunny there now

Just like summer up here We can go in bathing in the surf every day

Jim sprang to his feet

Got a bathing suit

Yesa beauty Ive never worn it here

Why

It seemed so bold

All right Maybe we can get a Key all by ourselves for two weeks

Wouldnt it be glorious

Well try it anyhow Ill buy the doggoned thing if they dont ask too
much Pack your traps Ill go down to the shop and get my things Well
be ready to start in an hour

By four oclock they were seated in the drawingroom of a Pullman car
on the Florida Limited gazing entranced at the drab landscape of the
Jersey meadows

Three days later Jim had landed his boat on a tiny sand reef a
halfmile off the coast of Florida with a tent and complete outfit for
camping Like two romping children they tied the boat to a stake and
rushed over the sanddunes to the beach They explored their domain from
end to end within an hour Not a tree obscured the endless panorama of
sea and bay and waving grass on the great solemn marshes Piles of soft
warm seaweed lay in long dark rows along the hightide mark

Mary selected a sanddune almost exactly the height and shape of the one
on which they sat at Long Beach the day he told her of his love

Heres the spot for our home she cried Dont you recognize it

Cant say Ive ever been here before Oh I got youI got you Long
Beachsure What do you think of that

He hurried to the boat and brought the tent Mary carried the spade the
pole and pegs

In half an hour the little white home was shining on the level sand at
the foot of their favorite dune The door was set toward the open sea
and the stove securely placed beneath an awning which shaded it from the
suns rays

Now Kiddo a plunge in that shining water the first thing Ill give
you the tent Ill chuck my things out here

In a fever of joyous haste she threw off her clothes and donned the
dainty onepiece bathing suit She flew over the sand and plunged into
the water before Jim had finished changing to his suit

She was swimming and diving like a duck in the lazy beautiful waters of
the Gulf when he reached the beach

Come on Come on she shouted

He waved his hand and finished his cigarette

Its glorious Its midsummer she called

With a quick plunge he dived into the water disappeared and stayed
until she began to scan the surface uneasily With a splash he rose by
her side lifting her screaming in his arms Her bathingcap was brushed
off and he seized her long hair in his mouth turned and with swift
strong beat carried her unresisting body to the beach

He drew her erect and looked into her smiling face

Thats the way Id save you if you had called for help Howd you like
it

It was sweet to give up and feel myself in your power dear

His drooping eyes were devouring her exquisite figure outlined so
perfectly in the clinging suit

I was afraid to wear this in New York she said demurely

I cant blame you If youd ever have gone on the beach at Coney Island
in that thered have been a riot

He lifted her in his arms and kissed her

And youre all mine Kiddo Its too good to be true Im afraid to
wake up mornings now for fear Ill find Ive just been dreaming

They plunged again in the water and side by side swam far out from the
shore circled gracefully and returned

Hours they spent snuggling in the warm sand Not a sound of the world
beyond the bay broke the stillness The music of the waters soft
sighing came on their ears in sweet endless cadence The wind was
gentle and brushed their cheeks with the softest caress Far out at sea
whitewinged sails were spreadso far away they seemed to stand in one
spot forever The deep cry of an ocean steamer broke the stillness at
last

We must dress for dinner Jim she sighed

Why Kiddo

We must eat you know

But why dress I like that style on you Its too much trouble to
dress

All right she cried gayly Well have a little informal dinner this
evening I love to feel the sand under my feet

He gathered the wood from the dry drifts above the waterline and kindled
a fire The saltsoaked sticks burned fiercely and the dinner was
cooked in a jiffya fresh chicken he had bought sweet potatoes and
delicious buttered toast

They sat in their bathing suits on campstools beside the folding table
and ate by moonlight

The dinner finished Mary cleared the wooden dishes while Jim brought
heaps of the dry spongy sea grass and made a bed in the tent He piled
it two feet high packed it down to a foot and then spread the sheets
and blankets

All ready for a stroll down the avenue Kiddo he called from the
door

Fifth Avenue or Broadway she laughed

Oh the Great White Wayyou couldnt miss it Just look at the shimmer
of the moon on the sands Aint it great

Hand in hand they strolled on the beach and bathed in the silent flood
of the moonlit nightno prying eyes near save the stars of the friendly
southern skies

The moon seems different down here Jim she whispered

It is different he answered with boyish enthusiasm Its all so
still and white

Could we stay here forever

He shook his head emphatically

Not on your life This little boy has to work you know Old man John
D Rockefeller might but its early for a young financier to retire

A whole week then

Sure For a week well forget New York

They sat down on the sanddune behind the tent and watched the waters
flash in the silvery light the world and its fevered life forgotten

Youre the only thing real tonight Jim she sighed

And youre the world for me Kiddo

She waked at dawn with a queer feeling of awe at the weird gray light
which filtered through the cotton walls A sense of oneness with Nature
and the beat of Her eternal heart filled her soul The soft wash of the
water on the sands seemed to be keeping time to the throb of her own
pulse

She peered curiously into the face of her sleeping lover She had never
seen him asleep before She started at the transformation wrought by
the closing of his heavy eyelids and the complete relaxation of his
features The strange steelblue coloring of his eyes had always given
his face an air of mystery and charm The complete closing of the
heavy lids and the slight droop of the lower jaw had worked a frightful
change The romance and charm had gone and instead she saw only the
coarse brutal strength

She frowned like a spoiled child put her dainty hand under his chin and
pressed his mouth together

Wake up sir she whispered I dont like your expression

He refused to stir and she drew the tips of her fingers across his ears
and eyelids

He rubbed his eyes and muttered

What tell

Lets take a bath in the sea before sunrisecome on

The sleeper groaned heavily turned over and in a moment was again dead
to the world

Marys eyes were wide now with excitement The hours were too marvelous
to be lost in sleep She could sleep when they must return to the
tiresome world with its endless crowds of people

She rose softly ran barefoot to the beach threw her nightdress on
the sand and plunged her white young body trembling with joy into the
water

It was marvelousthis wonderful hush of the dawn over the infinite sea
The air and water melted into a pearl gray Far out toward the east
the waters began to blush at the kiss of the coming sun The pearl
gray slowly turned into purple So startling was the vision she swam
inshore and stood kneedeep in the shallows to watch the magic changes
In breathless wonder she saw the sea and sky and shore turn into a
trembling cloud of dazzling purple A moment before she had caught the
water up in her hand and poured it out in a stream of pearls She lifted
a handful and poured it out now each drop a dazzling amethyst And even
while she looked the purple was changing to scarletthe amethyst into
rubies

A great awe filled her in the solemn hush She stood in Natures vast
cathedral close to Gods hearther life in harmony with His eternal
laws

How foolish and artificial were the ways of the faraway drab prosaic
world of clothes and houses and furnishings If she could only live
forever in this dreamworld

Even while the thought surged through her heart she lifted her head and
saw the red rim of the sun suddenly break through the sea and started
lest the white light of day had revealed her to some passing boatman
hurrying to his nets

Her keen eye quickly swept the circle of the wide silent world of
sanddunes marsh and waters No prying eye was near Only the morning
star still gleaming above saw And they were twin sisters

Four days flew on velvet wings before the first cloud threw its shadow
across her life Jim always slept until nine oclock and refused with
dogged goodnatured indifference to stir when she had asked him to get
the wood for breakfast It was nothing of course to walk a hundred
yards to the beach and pick up the wood and she did it The hurt that
stung was the feeling that he was growing indifferent

She felt for the first time an impulse to box his lazy jaws as he yawned
and turned over for the dozenth time without rising He looked for all
the world like a bulldog curled up on his bed of grass

She shook him at last

Jim dear you must get up now Breakfast is almost ready and it wont
be fit to eat if you dont come on

He opened his heavy eyelids and gazed at her sleepily

All righto Just as you sayjust as you say

Hurry Breakfast will be ready before you can dress

Gee Breakfast all ready Youre one smart little wifie Kiddo

The compliment failed to please She was sure that he had been fully
awake twice before and pretended to be asleep from sheer laziness and
indifference

The thought hurt

When they sat down at last to breakfast she looked into his halfclosed
eyes with a sudden start

Why Jim your eyes are red

Yes

Whats the matter

Nothing

Youre illwhat is it

He grinned sheepishly

You couldnt guess now could you

You havent been drinking she gasped

No he drawled lazily I wouldnt say drinkingI just took one
big swallow last nightmakes you sleep good when youre tired Good
medicine I always carry a little with me

A sickening wave went over her Not that she felt that he was going
to be a drunkard But the utter indifference with which he made the
announcement was a painful revelation of the fact that her opinion on
such a question was not of the slightest importance That he was now
master of the situation he evidently meant that she should see and
understand at once

She refused to accept the humiliating position without a struggle and
made up her mind to try at once to mold his character She would begin
by getting him to cut the slang from his conversation

You remember the promise you made me one day before we were married
Jim she asked brightly

Which one You know a fellows not responsible for what he promises to
get his girl Alls fair in love and war they say

Im going to hold you to this one sir she firmly declared

All right little bright eyes he responded cheerfully as he lit a
cigarette and sent the smoke curling above his red head

She sat for a while in silence studying the man before her The task
was delicate and difficult And she had thought it a mere pastime of
love As her fiance he had been wax in her hands As her husband he
was a lazy headstrong obstinate young animal grinning goodnaturedly
at her futile protests How long would he grin and bear her suggestions
with patience The transition from this lazy grin to the growl of an
angry bulldog might be instantaneous

She would move with the utmost cautionbut she would move and at once
It would be a test of character between them She edged her chair close
to his drew his head down in her lap and ran her fingers through his
thick red hair

Still love me Jim she smiled

Crazier over you every dayand you know it too you sly little puss
he answered dreamily

You WILL make good your promises

Sure I willsurest thing you know

You see Jim dear she went on tenderly I want to be proud of
you

Well aint you

Of course I am silly I know you and understand you But I want all
the world to respect you as I do She paused and breathed deeply
Theyve got to do it too theyve got to

Sure Ill knock their block offif they dont he broke in

She raised her finger reprovingly and shook her head

Thats just the trouble you cant do it with your fists You cant
compel the respect of cultured men and women by physical force Weve
got to win with other weapons

All right Kiddodope it out for me he responded lazily Dope it
out

Her lips quivered with the painful recognition of the task before her
Yet when she spoke her voice was low and sweet and its tones even She
gave no sign to the man whose heavy form rested in her arms

Then from today we must begin to cut out every word of slangits a
bargain

Sure MikeI promised

Cut Sure Mike

She raised her finger severely

All right teacher he drawled Whatll we put in Sure Mikes place
Ive found him a handy man

Say certainly

Jim grinned goodnaturedly

Aw hell Kiddothat sounds punk

And HELL Jim isnt a nice word

Gee Kid now look herecant get along with out HELLleave me that
one just a little while

She shook her head

No

No

And PUNK is expressive but not suited to parlor use

All righttell with PUNK He turned and looked Whats the matter
now he asked

Dont you realize what youve just said

What did I say

She turned away to hide a tear

He threw his arms around her neck and drew her lips down to his

Ah dont worry KiddoIll do better next time Honest to God I
will Thats enough for today Just lets love now Tell with the
rest

She smiled in answer

You promise to try honestly

He raised his hand in solemn vow

Shelp me

Each days trial ended in a laugh and a kiss until at last Jim refused
to promise any more He grinned in obstinate goodnatured silence and
let her do the worrying

She watched him with growing wonder and alarm He gradually lapsed into
little coarse ugly habits at the table She tried playfully to
correct them He took it goodnaturedly at first and then ignored her
suggestions as if she were a kitten complaining at his feet

She studied him with baffling rage at the mystery of his personality
The long silences between them grew from hour to hour She could see
that he was restless now at the isolation of their sandisland home The
queer lights and shadows that played in his cold blue eyes told only
too plainly that his mind was back again in the world of battle He was
fighting something too

She was glad of it She could manage him better there She would
throw him into the company of educated people and rouse his pride and
ambition She heard his announcement of their departure on the eighth
day with positive joy

Well Kiddo he began briskly weve got to be moving Time to get
back to work now The old town and the little shop down in Avenue B have
been calling me

Today Jim she asked quickly

Right away Well catch the first train north stop two days Christmas
Eve and Christmas in Asheville and then for old New York

The journey along the new railroad built on concrete bridges over miles
of beautiful waters was one of unalloyed joy They had passed over this
stretch of marvelous engineering at night on their trip down and had not
realized its wonders For hours the train seemed to be flying on velvet
wings through the ocean

She sat beside her lover and held his hand In spite of her enthusiasm
he would doze At every turn of entrancing view she would pinch his arm

Look Jim Look

He would lift his heavy eyelids grunt goodnaturedly and doze again

In the diningcar she was in mortal terror at first lest he should lapse
into the coarse table manners into which he had fallen in camp She laid
his napkin conspicuously on his plate and saw that he had opened and put
it in place across his lap before ordering the meals

The moment he found himself in a crowd the lights began to flash in his
eyes his broad shoulders lifted and his whole being was at once alert
and on guard He followed his wifes lead with unerring certainty

She renewed her faith in his early reformation though his character
was a puzzle He seemed to be forever watching out of the corners of his
slumbering eyes She wondered what it meant




CHAPTER XIII THE REAL MAN

They arrived in Asheville the night before Christmas Eve Jim listened
to his wifes prattle about the wonderful views with quiet indifference

They stopped at the Battery Park Hotel and she hoped the waning moon
would give them at least a glimpse of the beautiful valley of the French
Broad and Swannanoa rivers and the dark towering ranges of mountains
among the stars She made Jim wait on the balcony of the room for half
an hour but the clouds grew denser and he persisted in nodding

His head dipped lower than usual and she laughed

Poor old sleepyhead

For the love o Mike Kiddome for the hay Wont them mountains wait
till morning

All right she answered cheerily Ill pull you out at sunrise The
sunrise from our window will be glorious

He rose and stretched his body like a young well fed tiger

I think its prettier from the bed But have it your own wayhave it
your own way Ill agree to anything if you lemme go to sleep now

She rose as the first gray fires of dawn began to warm the cloudbanks
on the eastern horizon stood beside her window and watched in silent
ecstasy Jim was sleeping heavily She would not wake him until the
glory of the sunrise was at its height She loved to watch the changing
lights and shadows in sky and valley and on distant mountain peaks as
the light slowly filtered over the eastern hills

She had recovered from the depression of the last days of their camp
The journey back into the world had improved Jims manners There could
be no doubt about his ambitions His determination to be a millionaire
was the lever she now meant to work in raising his social aspirations

Why should she feel depressed

Their married life had just begun The two weeks they had passed on
their honeymoon had been happy beyond her dreams of happiness Somehow
her imagination had failed to give any conception of the wonder and
glory of this revelation of life His little lapses of selfishness on
their sand island no doubt came from ignorance of what was expected of
him

For one thing she felt especially thankful There had been no ugly
confessions of a shady past to cloud the joy of their love Her lover
might be ignorant of the ways of polite society He was equally free of
its sinister vices She thanked God for that The soul of the man she
had married was clean of all memories of women The love he gave was
fierce in its unrestrained passionbut it was all hers She gloried in
its strength

She made up her mind standing there in the soft light of the dawn that
she would bend his iron will to her own in the growing sweet intimacy
of their married life and threw her fears to the winds

The thin fleecy clouds that hung over the low range of the eastern
foreground were all aglow now with every tint of the rainbow while the
suns bed beyond the hills was flaming in scarlet and gold

She clapped her hands in ecstasy

Jim Jim dear

He made no response and she rushed to his side and whispered

You must see this sunriseget up quick quick dear Its wonderful

Whats the matter he muttered

The sunrise over the mountainsquickits glorious

His heavy eyelids drooped and closed He dropped on the pillow and
buried his face out of sight

Ah Jim dear do comejust to please me

Im dead Kiddodead to the world he sighed Dont like to see the
sun rise I never did Come on back and lets sleep

His last words were barely audible He was breathing heavily as his lips
ceased to move

She gave it up returned to the window and watched the changing colors
until the white light from the suns face had touched with life the
last shadows of the valleys and flashed its signals from the farthest
towering peaks

Her whole being quivered in response to the beauty of this glorious
mountain world The air was wine She loved the sapphire skies and the
warm lazy caressing touch of the sun of the South

A sense of bitterness came just for a moment that the man she had
chosen for her mate had no eye to see these wonders and no ear to hear
their music During the madness of his whirlwind courtship she had
gotten the impression that his spirit was sensitive to beautyto the
waters of the bay the sea and the wooded hills She must face the
facts Their stay on the island had convinced her that he had eyes only
for her She must make the most of it

It was ten oclock before Jim could be persuaded to rise and get
breakfast She literally pulled him up the stairs to the observatory on
the tower of the hotel

Whats the game Kiddo Whats the game he grumbled

Ask me no questions But do just as I tell you come on

Her face was radiant her hair in a tangle of riotous beauty about her
forehead and temples her eyes sparkling

Dont look till I tell you she cried as they emerged on the little
minaret which crowns the tower

Now open and see the glory of the Lord she cried with joyous awe

The day was one of matchless beauty The clouds that swung low in
the early morning had floated higher and higher till they hung now in
shining billows above the highest balsamcrowned peaks in the distance

In every direction as far as the eye could reach north south east
west the dark ranges mounted in the azure skies until the farthest dim
lines melted into the heavens

Oh Jim dear isnt it wonderful Were lucky to get this view on our
first day Its such a good omen

Jim opened his eyes lazily and puffed his cigarette in a calm
patronizing way

Tough sledding wed have had with an automobile over those hills he
said Well try it after lunch though

Well go for a ride she cried joyfully

Yep Got to hunt up the folks The mountains near Asheville he said
with disgust I should say they are nearand far too Holy smoke
Ill bet we get lost

Nonsense

Wheres the Black Mountains I wonder he asked suddenly

Over there She pointed to the giant peaks projecting here and there
in dim blue waves beyond the Great Craggy Range in the foreground

Holy Moses Do we have to climb those crags before we start

To go to Black Mountain

Yes Thats where the lawyer said they lived under Cattail Peak in
the Black Mountain Rangewherever tell that is

No no You dont climb the Great Craggy you go around this end of it
and follow the Swannanoa River right up to the foot of Mount Mitchell
the highest peak this side of the Rockies The Cattail is just beyond
Mount Mitchell

Youve been there he asked in surprise

Once with a party from Asheville We spent three days and slept in
caves

Suppose youd know the way now

We couldnt miss it We follow the bed of the Swannanoa to its
source

Then that settles it Well go by ourselves I dont want any mutt
along to show us the way We couldnt get lost nohow could we

Of course notall the roads lead to Asheville We can ask the way to
the house you want when we reach the little stopping place at the foot
of Mount Mitchell

Gee Kid youre a wonder he exclaimed admiringly Couldnt get
along without you now could I

I hope not sir

You bet I couldnt Well start right away The roads will give us a
jolt

He turned suddenly to go

Waitwait a minute dear she pleaded You havent seen this
gorgeous view to the southwest with Mount Pisgah looming in the center
like some vast cathedral spirelook isnt it glorious

Fine Fine he responded in quick businesslike tones

You can look for days and weeks and not begin to realize the changing
beauty of these mountains clothed in eternal green Just think dear
Mount Pisgah there is forty miles away and it looks as if you
could stroll over to it in an hours walk And there are twentythree
magnificent peaks like that all of them more than six thousand feet
high

She paused with a frown He was neither looking nor listening He had
fallen into a brown study his mind was miles away

Youre not listening Jimnor seeing anything she said
reproachfully

NoKiddo we must get ready for that trip Ive got a letter for a
lawyer downtown Ill find him and hire a car Ill be back here for you
in an hour Youll be ready

Right away in half an hour

Just pack a suitcase for us both Well stay one night Ill take a
bag too that I have in my trunk

It was noon before he returned with a staunch touring car ready for the
trip He opened the little steamer trunk which he had always kept locked
and took from it a small leather bag He placed it on the floor and in
spite of careful handling the ring of metal inside could be distinctly
heard

What on earth have you got in that queer black bag she asked in
surprise

Oh just a lot o junk from the shop I thought I might tinker with
it at odd times I dont want to leave it here Its got one of my new
models in it

He carried the bag in his hand refusing to allow the porter who came
for the suitcase to touch it

He threw the suitcase in the bottom of the tonneau The bag he stowed
carefully under the cushions of the rear seat The moment he placed his
hand on the wheel of the machine he was at his best Every trace of the
street gamin fell from him Again he was the eagleeyed master of
time and space The machine answered his touch with more than human
obedience He knew how to humor its mood He conserved its power for a
hill with unerring accuracy and threw it over the grades with rarely
a pause to change his speeds He could turn the sharp curves with such
swift easy grace that he scarcely caused Marys body to swerve an inch
He could sense a rough place in the road and glide over it with velvet
touch

A tire blew out five miles up the stream from Asheville and the easy
businesslike deliberation with which he removed the old and adjusted
the new was a revelation to Mary of a new phase of his character

He never once grunted or swore or lost his poise or manifested
the slightest impatience He set about his task coolly carefully
skillfully and finished it quickly and silently

His long silences at last began to worry her An invisible barrier had
reared itself between them The impression was purely mentalbut it was
none the less real and distressing

There was a look of aloof absorption about him she had never seen
before At first she attributed it to the dread of meeting his kinsfolk
for the first time his fear of what they might be like or what they
might think of him

He answered her questions cheerfully but mechanically Sometimes he
stared at her in a cold impersonal way and gave no answer as if her
questions were an impertinence and she were not of sufficient importance
to waste his breath on

Unable at last to endure the strain she burst out impatiently

What on earths the matter with you Jim

Why he asked softly

You havent spoken to me in half an hour and Ive asked you two
questions

Just studying about something Kiddo something big Ill tell you
sometime maybenot now

Slowly a great fear began to shape itself in her heart The real man
behind those slumbering eyes she had never known Who was he




CHAPTER XIV UNWELCOME GUESTS

While she was yet puzzling over the strange mood of absorbed brooding
into which Jim had fallen his face suddenly lighted and he changed
with such rapidity that her uneasiness was doubled

They had reached the stretches of deep forest at the foot of the Black
Mountain ranges The Swannanoa had become a silver thread of laughing
foaming spray and deep still pools beneath the rocks The fields were
few and small The little clearings made scarcely an impression in the
towering virgin forests

Great guns Kiddo he exclaimed this is some country By George I
had no idea there was such a place so close to New York

She looked at him with uneasy surprise What could be in his mind The
solemn gorge through which they were passing gave no entrancing views
of clouds or sky or towering peaks Its wooded cliffs hung ominously
overhead in threatening shadows The scene had depressed her after the
vast sunlit spaces of sky of shining valleys and cloudcapped sapphire
peaks on which they had turned their backs

You like this Jim she asked

Its greatgreat

I thought that waterfall we just passed was very beautiful

I didnt see it But this is something like it Youre clean out of the
world hereand there aint a railroad in twenty miles

The deeper the shadows of tree and threatening crag the higher Jims
strange spirit seemed to rise

She watched him with increasing fear How little she knew the real man
Could it be possible that this lonely unlettered boy of the streets
of lower New York starved and stunted in childhood had within him the
soul of a great poet How else could she explain the sudden rapture over
the threatening silences and shadows of these mountain gorges which
had depressed her And yet his utter indifference to the glories of
beautiful waters his blindness at noon before the most wonderful
panorama of mountains and skies on which she had ever gazed
contradicted the theory of the poetic soul A poet must see beauty where
she had seen itand a thousand wonders her eyes had not found

His elation was uncanny What could it mean

He was driving now with a skill that was remarkable a curious
smile playing about his drooping Oriental eyelids A wave of fierce
resentment swept her heart She was a mere plaything in this mans life
The real man she had never seen What was he thinking about What grim
secret lay behind the mysterious smile that flickered about the corners
of those eyes He was not thinking of her The mood was new and cold and
cynical for all the laughter he might put in it

She asked herself the question of his past his people his real
lifehistory The only answer was his baffling mysterious smile

A frown suddenly clouded his face

Hello Yere running right into a mans yard

Mary lifted her head with quick surprise

Why yes its the stopping place for the parties that climb Mount
Mitchell I remember it We stayed all night here left our rig and
started next morning at sunrise on horseback to climb the trail

Pretty near the jumpingoff place then he remarked Well ask the
way to Cattail Peak

He stopped the car in front of the lowpitched weatherstained frame
house and blew the horn

A mountain woman with three openeyed silent children came slowly to
meet them

She smiled pleasantly and without embarrassment spoke in a pleasant
drawl

Wont you light and look at your saddle

The expression caught Jims fancy and he broke into a roar of laughter
The woman blushed and laughed with him She couldnt understand what was
the matter with the man Why should he explode over the simple greeting
in which she had expressed her pleasure at their arrival

Anyhow she was an innkeepers wife and her business was to make folks
feel at homeso she laughed again with Jim

You know thats the funniest invitation I ever got in a car he cried
at last We fly in these things sometimes And when you said Wont
you lighthe paused and turned to his wifeI could just feel
myself up in the air on that big old racers back

Wont youall stay all night with us the soft voice drawled again

Thank you not tonight Mary answered

She waited for Jim to ask the way

Nonot tonight he repeated You happen to know an old woman by the
name of Owens who lives up here

Nance Owens

Thats her name

Lord everybody knows old Nance was the smiling answer

She aint got good sense the towheaded boy spoke up

Sh the mother warned boxing his ears

Shes a little queer thats all Everybody knows her in Buncombe and
Yancey counties Her house is built across the county line She eats in
Yancey and sleeps in Buncombe

Yes broke in the boy joyously an when the Sheriff o Yancey comes
she moves back into Buncombe Shes some punkins on a green gourd vine
she isif she aint got good sense

His mother struck at him again but he dodged the blow and finished his
speech without losing a word

Could you tell us the way to her house

Keep right on this road and you cant miss it

How far is it

Oh not far

No right at the bottom o the Catstail the boy joyfully explained

He means the foot o Cattail Peak the mother apologized

How many miles

Just a little waysye cant miss it the third house you come to on
this road

Youll be there in three shakes of a sheeps tailin that thing the
boy declared

Jim waved his thanks threw in his gear and the car shot forward on
the level stretch of road beyond the house He slowed down when out of
sight

Gee Id love to have that kid in a woodshed with a nice shingle all
by ourselves for just ten minutes

The people spoil him Mary laughed The people who stop there for the
Mount Mitchell climb He was a baby when I was there six years agoshe
paused and a rapt look crept into her eyesa beautiful little baby
her firstborn and she was the happiest thing I ever saw in my life

Her voice sank to a whisper

A vision suddenly illumined her own soul and she forgot her anxiety
over Jims queer moods

Deeper and deeper grew the shadows of crag gorge and primeval forest
The speedometer on the footboard registered five miles from the Mount
Mitchell house They had passed two cabins by the way and still no sign
of the third

Why couldnt she tell us how many miles Id like to know Jim
grumbled

Its the way of the mountain folk Theyre noncommittal on distances

He stopped the car and lighted the lamps

Going to be dark in a minute he said But I like this place he
added

He picked his way with care over the narrow road They crossed the
little stream they were trailing and the car crawled over the rocks
along the banks at a snails pace

An owl called from a dead treetop silhouetted against an open space of
sky ahead

Must be a clearing there Jim muttered

He stopped the car and listened for the sounds of life about a house

A vast brooding silence filled the world A wolf howled from the edge
of a distant crag somewhere overhead

For Gods sake Jim shivered What was that

Only a mountain wolf crying for company

Wolves up here he asked in surprise

A fewharmless timid lonesome fellows It makes me sorry for them
when I hear one

Great country I like it Jim responded

Again she wondered why What a queer mixture of strength and
mysterythis man she had married

He started the car turned a bend in the road and squarely in
front not more than a hundred yards away gleamed a light in a cabin
windowfour tiny panes of glass

By Geeminy we come near stopping in the front yard without knowing
it he exclaimed Didnt we

Im glad shes at home Mary exclaimed The light shines with a
friendly glow in these deep shadows

Afraid Kiddo he asked lightly

I dont like these dark places

All right when you get used to emsafer than daylight

Again her heart beat at his queer speech She shivered at the thought of
this uncanny trait of character so suddenly developed today She made
an effort to throw off her depression It would vanish with the sun
tomorrow morning

He picked his way carefully among the trees and stopped in front of the
cabin door The little house sat back from the road a hundred feet or
more

He blew his horn twice and waited

A sudden crash inside and the light went out He waited a moment for it
to come back

Only darkness and dead silence

Suppose she dropped dead and kicked over the lamp Jim laughed

She probably took the lamp into another room

No it went out too quickand it went out with a crash

He blew his horn again

Still no answer

Hello Hello he called loudly

Someone stirred at the door Jims keen ear was turned toward the house

I heard her bar the door Ill swear it

How foolish Jim Mary whispered You couldnt have heard it

All the same I did Heres a pretty kettle of fish The old hellions
not even going to let us in

He seized the lever of his horn and blew one terrific blast after
another in weird uncanny sobs and wails ending in a shriek like the
last cry of a lost soul

Dont Jim Mary cried shivering Youll frighten her to death

I hope so

Go up and speak to herand knock on the door

He waited again in silence scrambled out of the car and fumbled his
way through the shadows to the dark outlines of the cabin He found the
porch on which the front door opened

His light foot touched the log with sure step and he walked softly to
the cabin wall The door was not yet visible in the pitch darkness His
auto lights were turned the other way and threw their concentrated rays
far down into the deep woods

He listened intently for a moment and caught the catlike tread of the
old woman inside

I sayhello in there he called

Again the sound of her quick furtive step told him that she was on the
alert and determined to defend her castle against all comers What if
she should slip an old rifle through a crack and blow his head off

She might do it too

He must make her open the door

Say whats the matter in there he asked persuasively

A moments silence and then a gruff voice slowly answered

They aint nobody at home

The hell they aint Jim laughed

No

Who are you

She hesitated and then growled back

None o your business Who are you

Were strangers up herelost our way Its coldwe got to stop for
the night

Ye canttheys nobody home I tell ye she repeated with sullen
emphasis

Jim broke into a genial laugh

Ah Come on old girl Open up and be sociable Were not revenue
officers or sheriffs If youve got any good mountain whiskey Ill help
you drink it

Who are ye she repeated savagely

Ah just a couple o gentle cooing turtledovesa bride and groom
Loosen up old girl its Christmas Eveand were just a couple o
gentle cooin doves

Jim kept up his persuasive eloquence until the light of the candle
flashed through the window and he heard her slip the heavy bar from the
door

He lost no time in pushing his way inside

Nance threw a startled look at his enormous shaggy fur coatat the
shining aluminum goggles almost completely masking his face She gave
a low breathless scream hurled the doorbar crashing to the floor
and stared at him like a wild hunted animal at bay her thin hands
trembling the irongray hair tumbling over her forehead

Oh my God she wailed crouching back

Jim gazed at her in amazement He had forgotten his goggles and fur
coat

Whats the matter he asked in highkeyed tones of surprise

Nance made no answer but crouched lower and attempted to put the table
between them

What tell Bill ails youwill you tell me he asked with rising
wrath

I THOUGHT you wuz the devil the old woman panted Now I KNOW it

Jim suddenly remembered his goggles and coat and broke into a laugh

Oh

He removed his goggles and cap threw back his big coat and squared his
shoulders with a smile

Hows that

Nance glowered at him with illconcealed rage looked him over from head
to foot and answered with a snarl

Taint much betteref ye ax ME

Gee But youre a sociable old wildcat he exclaimed starting back
as if she had struck him a blow

His eye caught the dried skin of a young wildcat hanging on the log
wall

No wonder you skinned your neighbor and hung her up to dry he added
moodily

He took in the room with deliberate insolence while the old woman stood
awkwardly watching him shifting her position uneasily from one foot to
the other

In all his miserable life in New York he could not recall a room more
bare of comforts The rough logs were chinked with pieces of wood and
daubed with red clay The door was made of rough boards the ceiling
of hewn logs with split slabs laid across them An oldfashioned tall
spinning wheel dirty and unused sat in the corner A rough pine table
was in the middle of the floor and a smaller one against the wall
On this side table sat two rusty flatirons and against it leaned an
ironing board A dirty piece of turkeyred calico hung on a string for
a portiere at the opening which evidently led into a sort of kitchen
somewhere in the darkness beyond

The walls were decorated at intervals A huge bunch of onions hung on
a wooden peg beside the wildcat skin Over the window was slung an
oldfashioned muzzleloading musket The sling which held it was made of
a pair of ancient homemade suspenders fastened to the logs with nails
Beneath the gun hung a cows horn cut and finished for powder and with
it a dirty gamebag Strings of red peppers were strung along each of
the walls with here and there bunches of popcorn in the ears A pile of
black walnuts lay in one corner of the cabin and a pile of hickory nuts
in another

A threelegged wooden stool and a splitbottom chair stood beside the
table and a haircloth couch which looked as if it had been saved from
the Ark was pushed near the wall beside the door

Across this couch was thrown a ragged patchwork quilt and a pillow
covered with calico rested on one end with the mark of a head dented
deep in the center

Jim shrugged his shoulders with a look of disgust stepped quickly to
the door and called

Come on in Kid

Nance fumbled her thin hands nervously and spoke with the faintest
suggestion of a sob in her voice

I aint got nothin for ye to eat

Weve had dinner he answered carelessly

He stepped to the door and called

Bring that little bag from under the seat Kiddo

He held the door open and the light streamed across the yard to the
car He watched her steadily while she raised the cushion of the rear
seat lifted the bag and sprang from the car His keen eye never left
her for an instant until she placed it in his hands

Mercy but its heavy she panted as she gave it to him

He took it without a word and placed it on the table in the center of
the room

Nance glared at him sullenly

Theres no place for ye I tell ye

Jim faced her with mock politeness

For them kind wordsthanks

He bowed low and swept the room with a mocking gesture

There aint no room for ye the old woman persisted

Jim raised his voice to a squeaking falsetto with deliberate purpose to
torment her

I got ye the first time darlin he exclaimed lifting his hands
above her as if to hold her down We must linger awhile for your
nameanyhow we mustnt forget that This is Mrs Nance Owens

The old woman started and watched him from beneath her heavy eyebrows
answering with sullen emphasis

Yes

Again Jim lifted his hands above his head and waved her to earth

Well Dont blame me I cant help it you know

He turned to his wife and spoke with jolly good humor

Its the place all right Set down Kiddotake off your hat and
things Make yourself at home

Nance flew at him in a sudden frenzy at his assumption of insolent
ownership of her cabin

Theres no place for ye to sleep she fairly shrieked in his face

Again Jims arms were over her head waving her down

All right sweetheart Were from New York We dont sleep Weve come
all the way down here to the mountains of North Carolina just to see
you And were goin to sit up all night and look at ye

He sat down deliberately and Nance fumbled her hands with a nervous
movement

Marys heart went out in sympathy to the forlorn old creature in her
embarrassment Her dress was dirty and ragged an illfitting gingham
the elbows out and her bare bony arms showing through The waist was
too short and always slipping from the belt of wrinkled cloth beneath
which she kept trying to stuff it

Mary caught her restless eye at last and held it in a friendly look

Please let us stay she pleaded We can sleep on the
flooranywhere

You bet Jim joined in Married two weeksand I dont care whether
it rains or whether it pours or how long I have to stand outdoorsif I
can be with you Kid

The old woman hesitated until Marys smile melted its way into her
heart

Her lips trembled and her watery blue eyes blinked

Well she began grumblingly thars a little single bed in that
shedroom thar for youef hell sleep in here on the sofy

Jim leaped to his feet

What do ye think of that Bully for the old gal Kinder slow at first
As the poet sings of the little bedbug she aint got no wingsbut she
gets there just the same

He drew the electric torch from his pocket and advanced on Nance

By GollyIll have another look at you

Nance backed in terror at the sight of the revolverlike instrument

Whats that she gasped

Just a little Gatlin gun he cried jokingly He pressed the button
and the light flashed squarely in the old womans eyes

God lmightydont shoot she screamed

Jim doubled with laughter

For the love o Mike

Nance leaned against the side table and wiped the perspiration from her
brow

Lord I thought youd kilt me she panted still trembling

Ah dont be foolish Jim said persuasively It cant hurt you Here
take it in your handIll show you how to work it Its to nose round
dark places under the buzzwagon

He held it out to Nance

Here take it and press the button

The old woman drew back

NonoIm skeered No

Jim thrust the torch into her hand and forced her to hold it

Oh come on its easy Push your finger right down on the button

Nance tried it gingerly at first and then laughed at the ease with
which it could be done She flashed it on the floor again and again

Why its like a big lightnin bug aint it

She turned the end of it up to examine more closely pushed the button
unconsciously and the light flashed in her eyes She jumped and handed
it quickly to Jim

Or a jack o lanternhere take it she cried still trembling

Jim threw his hands up with a laugh

Can you beat it

Backing quickly to the door Nance called nervously to Mary

Ill get your room ready in a minute maam She paused and glanced at
Jim

And thars a shed out thar you can put your devil wagon in

She slipped through the dirty calico curtains and Mary saw her go with
wondering pity in her heart




CHAPTER XV A LITTLE BLACK BAG

Mary watched Nance with a quick glance at Jim Again he had forgotten
that he had a wife She had studied this strange absorption with
increasing uneasiness During the long beautiful drive of the afternoon
beside laughing waters through scenes of unparalleled splendor through
valleys of entrancing peace the still sapphire skies bending above
with clear Southern Christmas benediction he had not once pressed her
hand he had not once bent to kiss her

Each time the thought had come she fought back the tears She had
made excuses for him He was absorbed in the memories of his miserable
childhood in New York perhaps The approaching meeting with his
relatives had awakened the old hunger for a mothers love that had
been denied him The scenes through which they were passing had perhaps
stirred the currents of his subconscious being

And yet why should such memories estrange his spirit from hers The
effect should be the opposite In the remembrance of his loneliness and
suffering he should instinctively turn to her The love with which she
had unfolded his life should redeem the past

He was standing now with his heavy chin silhouetted against the
flickering light of the candle on the table His hand closed suddenly
on the handle of the bag with the swift clutch of an eagles claw She
started at the ugly picture it made in the dim rays of the candle

What were the thoughts seething behind the mask of his face She watched
him spellbound by his complete surrender to the mood that had dominated
him from the moment he had touched the deep forests of the Black
Mountain range A grim elation ruled even his silences The man standing
there rigid his face a smiling twitching mask was a stranger This
man she had never known or loved And yet they were bound for life in
the tenderest and strongest ties that can hold the human soul and body

She tossed her head and threw off the ugly thought It was morbid
nonsense She was just hungry for a kiss and in his new environment he
had forgotten himself as many thoughtless men had forgotten before and
would forget again

Jim she whispered tenderly

He made no answer His thick lips were drawn in deep twisted lines
on one side as if he had suddenly reached a decision from which there
could be no appeal

She raised her voice slightly

Jim

Not a muscle of his body moved The drawn lines of the mouth merely
relaxed His answer was scarcely audible

Yep

Shes gone

Yep

She moved toward him wistfully

Arent you forgetting something

His square jaw still held its rigid position silhouetted in sharp
profile against the candles light He answered slowly and mechanically

What

His indifference was more than the sore heart could bear The pentup
tears of the afternoon dashed in flood against the barriers of her will

Youhaventkissedmetoday she stammered struggling with each
word to save a break

Still he stood immovable This time his answer was tinged with the
slightest suggestion of amusement

No

She staggered against the table beside the door and gripped its edge
desperately

Oh she gasped Dont you love me any more

With his sullen head still holding its position of indifference his
absorption in the idea which dominated his mind still unbroken he threw
out one hand in a gesture of irritation

Cut it Kid Cut it

His tones were not only indifferent they were contemptuously
indifferent

With a sob she sank into the chair and buried her face in her arms

Youre tired I see it now youve tired of me Ohits not
possibleits not possible

The torrent came at last in a flood of utter abandonment

Jim turned looked at her and threw up his hands in temporary surrender

Oh for Gods sake he muttered crossing deliberately to her side He
stood and let her sob

With a quick change of mood he drew her to her feet swept her swaying
form into his arms crushed her and covered her lips with kisses

Hows that

She smiled through her tears

I feel better

Jim laughed

For better or worseuntil Death do us partthats what you said
Kid and you meant it too didnt you

He seized both of her arms held them firmly and gazed into her eyes
with steady stern inquiry

She looked up with uneasy surprise

Of courseI meant it she answered slowly

He held her arms gripped close and said

Wellwell see

His hands relaxed and he turned away rubbing his square chin
thoughtfully

She watched him in growing amazement What could be the mystery back of
this new twist of his elusive mind

He laid his hand on the black bag again smiled and turned and faced
her with expanding good humor

Great scheme this marryin Kid And you believe in it exactly as I
do dont you

How do you mean she faltered

That it binds and holds both our lives as only Almighty God can bind
and hold

Yesnothing else IS marriage

Thats what I say too

He placed his hands on her shoulders

Great scheme he repeated I get a pretty girl to work for me for
nothing for the balance of my life He paused and lifted the slender
forefinger of his right hand And you pledged your pious soulI
memorized the words every one of them I Mary take thee James
to my wedded husbandTO HAVE AND TO HOLD from this day forward FOR
BETTER FOR WORSE for richer for poorer in sickness and in health
to love cherish AND OBEY TIL DEATH DO US PART ACCORDING TO GODS HOLY
ORDINANCE AND THEREUNTO I GIVE THEE MY TROTH

He paused lifted his head and smiled grimly Thats some promise
believe me Kiddo AND OBEYyou meant it all didnt you

She would have hedged lightly over that ugly old word which still
survived in the ceremony Craddock had used but for the sinister
suggestion in his voice back of the playful banter He had asked it half
in jest half in earnest She had caught by the subtle sixth sense the
tragic idea in that one word that he was going to hold her to it The
thought was too absurd

OBEYyou meant it didnt you he repeated grimly

A smile played about the corners of her mouth as she answered dreamily

YesIIPROMISED

Thats why I set my head on you from the firstyoure good and
sweetyoure the real thing

Again she caught the sinister suggestion in his tone and threw him a
startled look

What has come over you today Jim she asked

He hesitated and answered carelessly

Oh nothing Kiddojust been thinking a little about business Got
to go to work you know He returned to the table and touched the bag
lightly

Watch out now for this bag while I put up the carand dont forget
that curiosity killed the cat

Quick as a flash she asked

Whats in it

Jim threw up his hands and laughed

Didnt I tell you that curiosity killed a cat He pointed to the skin
on the wall Thats what stretched that wildcats hide up there She
got too near the old musket

Anyhow Im not afraid of her endwhats in it

Jim scratched his red head and looked at her thoughtfully

You asked me that once before today didnt you

Yes

Well its a little secret of mine Take my adviceput your hand on
it but not in it

Again the sinister look and tone chilled her

I dont like secrets between us Jim she said

She looked at the bag reproachfully and he watched her keenlythen
laughed

Id as well tell you and be done with it youll go in it anyhow

She tossed her head with a touch of angry pride He took her hand led
her across the room and placed it on the valise

Ive got five thousand dollars in gold in that bag

She drew back surprised beyond the power of speech

And Im going to give it to this old woman

To herwhy she gasped

Shes my mother

Your MOTHER

Yes

IIthoughtyou told me she was dead

No I said that I didnt know who she was

He paused and a queer brooding look crept into his face

I havent seen her since I was a little duffer three years old This
room and these wild crags and trees come back to me nowjust a glimpse
of them here and there Ive always remembered them I thought Id
dreamed it

You rememberhow wonderful she breathed reverently She understood
now and the clouds lifted

The skunk I called my daddy Jim went on thoughtfully took me to New
York He said that my mother deserted me when I was a kid I believed
him at first But when he beat me and kicked me into the streets I knew
he was a liar When I got grown I began to think and wonder about her I
hired a lawyer that knew my daddy and he found her here

With a cry of joy she seized his arms

Tell her quick Oh youre big and fine and generous Jimand I knew
it They said that you were a brute I knew they lied Tell her quick

He lifted his hand in protest

NopeIm going to put up a little job on the old girlshow her the
money tonight get her wild at the sight of itand give it to her
Christmas morning Weve only a few hours to wait

Oh give it to her nowJim Give it to her now

He shook his head and walked to the door

I want to say something to her first and give her time to think it
over Look out for the bag and Ill bring in the things

He swung the rough board door wide slammed it and disappeared in the
darkness

The young wife watched the bag a moment with consuming curiosity She
had fiercely resented his insulting insinuations at her curiosity and
yet she was wild to look at that glowing pile of gold inside and picture
the old womans joyous surprise

Her hand touched the lock carelessly and drew back as if her finger had
been burned She put her hands behind her and crossed the room

I wont be so weak and silly she cried fiercely

She heard Jim cranking the car It would take him five minutes more to
start it get it under the shed and bring in the suitcase and robes

Why shouldnt I see it she exclaimed He has told me about it She
hesitated and struggled for a moment quickly walked back to the bag and
touched the spring It yielded instantly

Why its not even locked she cried in tones of surprise at her silly
scruples

Her hand had just touched the gold when Nance entered

She snapped the bag and smiled at the old woman carelessly What a sweet
surprise she would have tomorrow morning

Nance crossed slowly glancing once at the girl wistfully as if she
wanted to say something friendly and then alarmed at her presumption
hurried on into the little shedroom

Mary waited until she returned

Rooms all ready in thar maam she drawled passing into the kitchen
without a pause

All rightthank you Mary answered

She quickly opened the bag thrust her hand into the gold and
withdrew it holding a costly greenleather jewelrycase of exquisite
workmanship There could be no mistake about its value

With a cry of joy she started back staring at the little box

Another surprise And for me Oh Jim man youre glorious My
Christmas present of course I mustnt look at itI wont

She pushed the case from her toward the bag and drew it back again

Whats the difference Ill take one little tiny peep

She touched the spring and caught her breath A string of pearls fit for
the neck of a princess lay shining in its soft depths She lifted them
with a sigh of delight Her eye suddenly rested on a stanza of poetry
scrawled on the satin lining in the trembling hand of an old man she had
known

She dropped the pearls with a cry of terror Her face went white and
she gasped for breath The jewelcase in her hand she had seen before
It had belonged to the old gentleman who lived in the front room on the
first floor of her building in the days when it was a boarding house
The wife he had idolized was long ago dead This string of pearls from
her neck the old man had worshiped for years The stanza from The
Rosary he had scrawled in the lining one day in Marys presence He had
moved uptown with the landlady Two months ago a burglar had entered his
room robbed and shot him

Its impossibleimpossible she gasped Oh dear Godits
impossible Of course the burglar pawned them and Jim bought them
without knowing Of course My nerves are on edge todayhow silly of
me

Jims footsteps suddenly sounded on the porch and she thrust the
jewelcase back into the bag with desperate effort to pull herself
together




CHAPTER XVI THE AWAKENING

For a moment she felt the foundations of the moral and physical world
sinking beneath her feet Dizziness swept her senses She gripped
the table leaning heavily against it her eye watching the door with
feverish terror for Jims appearance

She had never fainted in her life It was absurd but the room was
swimming now in a dim blur Again she gripped the table and set her
teeth She simply would not give up Why should she leap to the worst
possible explanation of the jewels The hatred of old Ella for Jim and
the furious antagonism of Jane Anderson had poisoned her mind after
all It was infamous that she could suspect her husband of crime merely
because two silly women didnt like him

He could explain the jewels He of course asked no questions of the
pawnbroker They were probably sold at auction and he bought them

It seemed an eternity from the time Jims foot step echoed on the little
porch until he pushed the door open and hastily entered his arms piled
with laprobes coats and the dresssuit case in his hand

He walked with quick firm step threw the coats and robes on the couch
and placed the suitcase at its head He hadnt turned toward her and
his face was still in profile while he removed the gloves from his
pockets threw them on the robes and drew the scarlet woolen neckpiece
from his throat

She was studying him now with new terrorstricken eyes Never had she
seen his jaw look so big and brutal Never had the droop of his eyelids
suggested such menace Never had the contrast of his slender hands and
feet suggested such hideous possibilities

Merciful God No No she kept repeating in her soul while her dilated
eyes stared at him in sheer horror of the suggestion which the jewels
had roused

She drew a deep breath and strangled the idea by her will

Ill at least be as fair as a jury she thought grimly Ill not
condemn him without a hearing

Jim suddenly became aware of the menace of her silence She had not
moved a muscle spoken or made the slightest sound since he had entered
He had merely taken in the room at a glance and had seen her standing in
precisely the same place beside the table

He saw now that she was leaning heavily against it

He raised his head and faced her with a sudden bold stare and his
voice rang in tones of sharp command

Well

She tried to speak and failed She had not yet sufficiently mastered her
emotions

Whats the matter he growled

Jim she gasped

He took a step toward her with set teeth

Youve been in that bagWell

Her face was white her voice husky

Those jewels Jim

A cunning smile played about his mouth and he shook his head

I tried to keep my little secret from you till Christmas morning but
youre on to my curves now Kiddo and Ill have to fess up

You bought them for me she asked with trembling eagerness

Who else do you reckon Id buy em for I was going to surprise you
too tomorrow morning Youve spoiled the fun

She had slipped close to his side and he could hear her quick intake of
breath

Thatssosweet of you Jim Im sorryIspoiled the
surpriseyoudplanned

Oh whats the difference he broke in carelessly Its all the same
five minutes after anyhow Well dont you like em Why dont you say
something

Theyre wonderful Jim Wherewheredid you buy them

He held her gaze in silence for an instant and fenced

Isnt that a funny question Kiddo he said in low tones I once
heard the old man I worked with in the shop say that you shouldnt look
a gift horse in the mouth

I just want to know she insisted

Im not going to tell you he said with a dry laugh

Why not

Because you keep asking

You wish to tease me

Maybe

Please

Why do you want to know Are you afraid theyre fakes

No theyre beautifultheyre wonderful

Well if you dont want them he broke in angrily Ill keep them
Ill sell them

Dont tease me Jim she begged I dont mind if you bought them at
a pawnshopif thats why you wont tell me That is the reason isnt
it Honestly isnt it

She asked the question with eager intensity She had persuaded herself
that it was so and the horror had been lifted She pressed close with
smiling trembling lips

I dont mind that Jim You got them from a pawnbroker of course
didnt you

He looked at her with a puzzled expression and hesitated

Didnt you she repeated

NoI didnt was the curt answer

You didnt she echoed feebly

No

With a quick breath she unconsciously drew back and he glared at her
angrily

Say whatells the matter with you anyhow Have you gone crazy

Youwonttell mewhere you bought them she asked slowly

He faced her squarely and spoke with deliberate contempt

Itsnoneof your business

She held his gaze with steady determination

That string of pearls belongs to the man who once lived in the front
room of my old building in New York He moved uptown with my landlady A
few months ago a burglar robbed and shot him

She stopped seized his arm and cried with strangling horror

Jim Jim Where did you get them

Now I know youve gone crazy You dont suppose thats the only string
of pearls in the world do you Did you count em Did you weigh em

Where did you get them she demanded

What put it into your head that that string of pearls belonged to your
old boarder

I saw him write the stanza of poetry on the satin lining of that case
Ive heard him recite it over and over again in his piping voice Each
bead a pearlmy rosary I KNOW that they belonged to him

His mouth twitched angrily and he faced her speaking with cold brutal
frankness

I might keep on lying to you Kiddo and get away with it But
whats the use Youve got to know Its just as well nowI did that
jobYes

Her face blanched

Youaburglara murderer

Jim followed her with quick angry gestures

All I wanted was his money He foughtit was his life or mine

A murderer

I just went after his moneyI tell youbesides he didnt die he
got well If hed kept still he wouldnt have lost his pearls and he
wouldnt have been hurt

And I stood up for you against them all she answered in a dazed
whisper They told meJane Anderson with brutal frankness Ella with
the heartrending timid confession of her own tragic lifethey told me
that you were bad I said they were liars I said that they envied our
happiness I believed that you were big and brave and fine I stood by
you and married you

She paused and looked at him steadily In a rush of suppressed passion
she seized his arm with a violence that caused his heavy eyelids to lift
in amused surprise

Oh Jimits not true Its not trueits not true For Gods sake
tell me that youre jokingthat youre teasing me You cant mean it
I wont believe itI wont believe it

Her head sank until it rested piteously against his breast He stood
with his face turned awkwardly away and then moved his body until she
was forced to stand erect

He touched her shoulder gently and spoke soothingly

Come now Kid dont take on so Ill quit the business when I make my
pile

She drew back instinctively and he followed

Ill never touch another penny of yours Theres blood on it

Rot he went on soothingly Its good Wall Street cashgot it
exactly like they got theirsgot it because I was quicker and smarter
than the fellow that had it I use a jimmy they use a tickerthats
all the difference

She drew her figure to its full height

Im goingJim

Where

His voice rasped like a file against steel

Home

Your homes with me

I wont live with a thief

He stepped squarely before her and spoke with deliberate menace

Yourenotgoing

Get out of my way she cried defiantly

His big jaw closed with a snap and his figure became rigid The candles
yellow light threw a strange glare on his face convulsed The blue
flames of hell were in the glitter of his steel eyes

Her heart sank in a dull wave of terror She tried to gauge the depth of
his brutal rage There was no standard by which to measure it She had
never seen that look in his face before His whole being was transformed
by some sinister power

She was afraid to move but her mind was alert in this moment of supreme
trial She hadnt used her last weapon yet The fact that he held her
with such terrible determination was proof of the spell she had cast
over him She might save him He couldnt have been a criminal long She
formed her new battleline with quick decision




CHAPTER XVII THE SURRENDER

How long she gazed into the convulsed face of the man who had squared
himself before her mattered little measured by the tick of the watch
in her belt Into the mental anguish endured a lifes agony had been
pressed It could not have been more than twenty seconds and yet it
marked the birth of a new being within the soul of a woman She had been
searching only for her own happiness The search had entangled another
in the meshes of her life Too much had been lived in the past two
weeks to be undone by a word and forgotten in a day She had attempted
cowardlike to run

She saw now in the consuming flame of a great sorrow that the man before
her had some rights which the purest woman must reckon with He might be
a burglar At least it was her duty to try to save him from himself Her
surrender of the past weeks was a tie that would bind them through all
eternity There was no chemistry of earth or heaven or hell that could
erase its memories Her life was no longer her ownthis mans was bound
with hers She must face the facts She would make one honest
brave effort to save him To do this she would give all without
reservationpride must be cast to the winds

Her voice suddenly changed to tears

Oh Jim you do love me dont you

His body slowly relaxed his eyes shifted and he shrugged his square
shoulders

Whatell did I marry you for

Tell medo you she demanded

You know that I love you What do you ask me such a fool question for
I love you with a love that can kill Do you hear me Thats why youre
not going anywhere without me

There was no mistaking the depth of his passion She trembled to realize
its power and yet it was the lever by which she must move him

Then youve got to give this life up Youre young and brave and
strong You can earn an honest living You havent been in this longI
feel it I know it Have you

No

How long

Eight months

Oh Jim dear you must give it up now for my sake Ill work with you
and work for you Ill teach Ill sew Ill scrub Ill slave for you
day and nightif youre only clean and honest

He turned on her fiercely

Cut it Kidcut it Im out for the stuff now Im going to get rich
and Im going to get rich QUICKthats all thats the matter with me

But Jim she broke in tenderlyyou did earn an honest living Your
workshop proves that

Ive used that to improve my tools and melt the swag the past year The
shops all right

But you did make a successful invention

You bet I did he answered savagely and thats why I quit the
business Three years ago I took down a big automobile and worked out an
improvement in the transmission that settled the question of heavy draft
machines I took it to a lawyer in Wall Street and he took it to a man
that had money Between the two of em they didnt do a thing to
me They were going to put my patent on the market and make me a
millionaire God I was crazy

He paused and squared his shoulders with a deep breath

They put it on the market all right and they made some
millionairesbut I wasnt one of em Kiddo They got me to sign a
paper that skinned me out of every dollar as slick as you can pull an
eel through your fingers I hired another lawyer and gave him half he
could get to beat em He fought like a tiger and two days before I
met you he got his verdict and they paid itjust ten thousand dollars
Think of itten thousand dollars And each of them got a million cash
They sold it outright for two millions and a half My lawyer got five
thousand dollars and I got five thousand dollars Thats mine anyhow
Its in that bag there Im working on a new set of tools now in my
shop Im going to get that money back from the two thieves who stole
it from me by law Ill take it by force the way they took it If I can
croak them both in the fightwell therell be two thieves less to rob
honest men and women thats all

Oh Jim Mary gasped lifting a trembling hand to her throat as if
to tear open her collar Youre mad You dont know what youre
saying

Dont fool yourself Kiddo he interrupted fiercely My eyes are open
now and Ive got a level head back of em too Ive doped it all out
You ought to a heard that lawyer give me a few lessons in business
when hed skinned me and salted my hide He was goodnatured and
confidential He seemed to love me Business is war sonny he piped
between the puffs of the big Havana cigar he was smokingwar war to
the knife We got you off your guard and put the knife into you at the
right minutethats all Dont take it so hard Invent something
else and keep your eyes peeled You ought to love us for giving you an
education in business early in life Youre young You wont have to
learn your lesson again Go to work sonny in your shop and turn out
another new tool for the advancement of trade

He paused and smiled grimly

Ive done it too Ive just finished a little invention thatll crack
any safe in New York in twenty minutes after I touch it

He broke into a dry laugh sat down and deliberately lighted a fresh
cigarette

She studied his face with beating heart Was he lost beyond all hope
of reformation Or was this the boyish bravado of an amateur criminal
poisoned by the consciousness of wrong She tried to think She felt the
red blood pounding through her heart and beating against her brain in
suffocating waves of despair

In vivid flashes the scene of her marriage but two weeks ago came back
in tormenting memories The solemn words she had spoken kept ringing
like the throb of a funeral bell far up in the starlit heavens


I MARY ADAMS TAKE THEE JAMES ANTHONY TO MY WEDDED HUSBAND TO HAVE
AND TO HOLD FOR BETTER FOR WORSE FOR RICHER FOR POORER IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH TO LOVE CHERISH AND TO OBEY TILL DEATH DO US PART
ACCORDING TO GODS HOLY ORDINANCE AND THERETO I GIVE THEE MY TROTH


The last solemn prayer kept ringing its deeptoned message over all


GOD THE FATHER GOD THE SON GOD THE HOLY GHOST BLESS PRESERVE AND
KEEP YOU THE LORD MERCIFULLY WITH HIS FAVOR LOOK UPON YOU AND FILL YOU
WITH ALL SPIRITUAL BENEDICTION AND GRACE THAT YE MAY SO LIVE TOGETHER
IN THIS LIFE THAT IN THE WORLD TO COME YE MAY HAVE LIFE EVERLASTING
AMEN


In a sudden rush of desperate pity for herself and the man to whom she
was bound she dropped on her knees by his side slipped her arms about
his neck and clung to him sobbing

Oh Jim Jim man she whispered hoarsely I cant see you sink into
hell like this Have you no real love in your heart for the woman who
has given all Have mercy on me Have mercy You cant mean the hideous
things youve just said Youve been crazed by your losses Youre just
a boy yet Life is all before you Youre only twentyfour Im just
twentyfour We can both begin anew Ive never lived until these
past weeksneither have you You couldnt drag me down into a life of
crime

Her head sank and her voice choked into silence He made no movement of
his hand to soothe her His voice was not persuasive It was hard and
cold

Im not asking you to help me on any of my jobs he said Im the
financier of the family You can say the prayers and keep house

Knowing that you are a criminal That your hands are stained with human
blood

Why not he snapped the blue blaze flashing again in his eyes
Suppose you were the wife of the gentlemanly lawyerthief who robbed
me using the law instead of a jimmywould you bother your little head
about my business Does his wife ask him where he got it Does anybody
know or care He lives on Fifth Avenue now He bought a palace up there
the day after he got my money We passed it on the way to the Park the
day I met you A line of carriages was standing in front and finely
dressed women were running up the red carpet that led down the stoop and
under the canopy to the curb Did any of the gay dames who smiled and
smirked at that thiefs wife ask how he got the money to buy the house
Not much Would they have cared if they had known Theyd have called
him a shrewd lawyerthats all Do you reckon his wife worries about
such tricks of trade Why should mine worry

She gripped his hand with desperate pleading

Oh Jim dear you cant be a criminal at heart I wouldnt have loved
you if it had been true I cant believe it I wont believe it Youre
posing You dont mean this You cant mean it Youre going to return
every dishonest dollar that youve taken

You dont know what youre talking about

He closed his jaw with a snap and leaned close in eager tense
excitement

Do you know how much junk Ive piled into a little box in my shop the
past three months

I dont careI dont want to know

Youve got to careyouve got to know now Its worth a hundred
thousand dollars do you hear A hundred thousand dollars It would take
me a lifetime to earn that on a salary In two weeks after we get back
to New York with my new invention that lawyer advised me to make Ill
go through his houseIll open his safe Ill take every diamond every
pearl and every scrap of stolen jewelry his wifes wearing And I wont
leave a fingerprint on the window sill Ive got two of his servants
working for me

In six months Ill be worth half a million In a year Ill pull off
the big haul Im planning and Ill be a millionaire Well retire from
business thenjust like they did Well build our marble palace down at
Bay Ridge and our yacht will nod in the harbor Well spend our summers
in Europe when we like and every snob and fool in New York will fall
over himself to meet me And every woman will envy my wife Im young
Kiddo but Ive cut my eye teeth Youve just been born Im running the
business end of this thing You think you can reform me You canAFTER
IVE MADE OUR PILE Ill join the church then and sing louder than that
lawyer But if you think youre going to stop my business career at this
stage of the gameforget it forget it

He sprang up with a quick movement of his tense body and threw her off
She rose and watched his restless steps as he paced the floor Her mind
was numb as if from a mortal blow She brushed the tangled ringlets of
brown hair back from her forehead drew the handkerchief from her belt
and wiped the perspiration from her brow

Before she could gather the strength to speak he wheeled suddenly and
confronted her

Ive known from the first Kiddo that youre not the kind to help in
this business I dont expect it I dont ask it I need a ranch
like this down here for storage Im going to take the old woman into
partnership with me

She started back in an instinctive recoil of horror

Your MOTHER

He nodded

Yep

She drew a step nearer and peered into his set face

YOU WILL MAKE YOUR OWN MOTHER A CRIMINAL

Sure he growled Thats what I came down here for

She wont do it

She wont eh he sneered Look at this hog pen

He swept the bare wretched cabin with a gesture of contempt and
shrugged his shoulders

Look at the rags shes wearing he went on savagely When we talk
it over tonight with that five thousand dollars in gold shining in
her eyesIm going to show her a lot o things she never saw before
Kiddotake it from me

She answered in slow even tones

I cant live with you Jim

The blue flames beneath the drooping eyelids were leaping now in the
yellow glare of the candles rays The muscles of his body were knotted
His voice came from his throat a low growl

Do you know who youre fooling with

The blood of a clean life flamed in her cheeks and nerved her with
reckless daring Her figure stiffened and her voice rang with defiant
scorn

Yes I know at lasta thief who would drag his own mother down to hell
with him

Not a muscle of his powerful body moved his face was a stolid mask He
threw his words slowly through his teeth

Now you listen to me Youre my wife I didnt invent this marriage
game I played it as I found it And thats the way youre going to play
it Youre good and sweet and cleanI like that kind and I wont
have no other Youre mine MINE do you hear Mine for lifebody and
soulFOR BETTER FOR WORSE FOR RICHER FOR POORER IN SICKNESS AND IN
HEALTH TO LOVE CHERISH

He paused and thrust his massive jaw squarely into her face

AND OBEY he hissed UNTIL DEATH DO US PART ACCORDING TO
GODS HOLY ORDINANCEyou said it didnt you

Yes

Well

She turned from him with sudden aversion

I didnt know what you were

Nobody ever knows BEFORE theyre married he broke in savagely You
took your chances I took mineFOR BETTER FOR WORSE Well just say
now its for worse and let it go at that

The little body stiffened

Ill die first

He held her gaze without words searching the depths of her being with
the cold blue flame in his drooping eyes If she were bluffing it was
easy She could talk her head off for all he cared If she meant it he
might have his hands full unless he mastered the situation at once and
for all time

There was no sign of yielding to his iron will An indomitable soul had
risen in her frail body and defied him His decision was instantaneous

Oh youll die sooner than live with meeh

There was something hideous in the cold venom with which he drawled
the words Her heart fairly stopped its beating With the last ounce of
courage left she held her place and answered

Yes

With the sudden crouch of a tiger he drew his clenched fist to strike

Forget it

She sprang back with terror her body trembling in pitiful weakness

You snivelling little coward he growled

Oh Jim Jim she falteredyouyoucouldnt strike me

A step nearer and he stood over her his big flat head thrust forward
his eyes gleaming his muscles knotted in blind rage

NoI wont STRIKE you he whispered Ill just KILL youthats
all

With the leap of an infuriated beast he sprang on her and his sharp
fingers gripped her throat


The world went black and she felt herself sinking into a bottomless
abyss With maniac energy she tore his hands from her throat and the
warm blood streamed from the gash his nails had torn

Jim Jim For Gods sake she moaned in abject terror

With a sullen growl his fingers sharp as a leopards claw found her
neck again and closed with a grip that sent the blood surging to her
brain and her eyes starting from their sockets

The one hideous thought that flashed through her mind was that he was
going to plunge his claws into her eyes and blind her for life He
could hold her his prisoner then She made a last desperate struggle
for breath her hands relaxed she drooped and sank to the couch toward
which he had hurled her in the first rush of his assault

He lifted her and choked the slender neck again to make sure loosed his
hands and the limp body dropped on the couch and was still

He stood watching her in silence his arms at his side

Damned little fool he muttered I had to give you that lesson The
sooner the better

He waited with contemptuous indifference until she slowly recovered
consciousness She lay motionless for a long time and then slowly opened
her eyes

Thank God They had not been gouged out as poor Ellas She didnt mind
the warm blood that soaked her collar and ran down her neck If he would
only spare her eyes Blindness had been her one unspeakable terror She
closed her eyes again and silently prayed for strength Her strength was
gone Wave after wave of sickening cowardly terror swept her prostrate
soul She could feel his sullen presencehis body with its merciless
strength towering above her She dared not look She knew that he was
watching her with cruel indifference A single cry a single word and he
might thrust his claw into her eyes and the light of the world would go
out forever

Her terror was too hideous she could endure it no longer She must
move She must try to save herself She lifted her head and caught his
steady venomous gaze

A quick sliding movement of abject fear and she was erect facing him
and backing away silently

He followed with even step his gaze holding her as the eyes of a snake
its victim She would not let him know her terror of blindness She
preferred death a thousand times If he would only kill her outright it
was all the mercy she would ask

YouwontkillmeJim she sobbed Pleaseplease dont kill
me

He lifted his sharp finger and followed her toward the shedroom door
his voice the triumphant cry of an eagle above his prey

FOR BETTER FOR WORSEUNTIL DEATH DO US PART

Her heart gave a bound of cowardly joy He had relented He would not
blind her She could live She was young and life was sweet

She tried to smile her surrender through her tears as she backed slowly
away from his ominous finger

Yes Ill tryJim Ill tryUNTIL DEATH DO US PARTUNTIL
DEATHUNTIL DEATH

Her voice broke into a flood of tears as she blindly felt her way
through the door and into the darkened room

He paused on the threshold held the creaking board shutter in his hand
and broke into a laugh

The world aint big enough for you to get away from me Kiddo Good
nighta good little wife now and its all right




CHAPTER XVIII TO THE NEW GOD

Jim closed the door of the little shedroom with a bang and stood
listening a moment to the sobs inside

UNTIL DEATH DO US PART Kiddo he laughed grimly

He turned back into the room and saw Nance standing at the opposite
entrance between the calico curtains an old battered flickering
lantern in her hand A white wool shawl was thrown over the gray head
and fell in long filmy waves about her thin figure Her deepsunken
eyes were exaggerated in the dim light of lantern and candle She smiled
wanly

He stopped short at the apparition a queer shiver of superstitious fear
shook him The white form of Death suddenly and noiselessly appearing
from the darkness could not have been more uncanny He had wondered
vaguely while the quarrel with his wife was progressing what had become
of his mother As the fight had reached its height he had forgotten
her

She looked at him blinking her eyes and trying to smile

Where the devil have you been old gal he asked nervously

Nowhere she answered evasively

Youve been mighty quiet on the trip anyhow I see youve brought
something back from nowhere

Nance glanced down at the jug she carried in her left hand and laughed

What is it he asked

Nothin

Nothin from nowhere sounds pretty good to me when I see it in a brown
jug on Christmas Eve Youre all right old gal I was just going to
ask if you had a little mountain dew Youre a mind reader Ill bet the
warehouse you keep that stored in is some snug harboreh

They aint never found it yit she giggled

And Ill bet they wontbully for you

She took down a tin cup from a shelf and placed it beside the jug

Another glass sweetheart

The old woman stared at him in surprise walked to the shelf and brought
another tin cup

What do ye want with two she asked in surprise

Jim moved toward the stool beside the table

Sit down

Me

Sure Lets be sociable Its Christmas Eve isnt it

Yeah Nance answered cheerfully taking her seat and glancing timidly
at her guest

Jim seized the jug poured out two drinks of corn whiskey handed her
one and raised his

Well heres lookin at you old girl

He paused lowered his cup and smiled

But say give me a toast He nodded toward the shedroom Im on my
honeymoon you know

His hostess laughed timidly and glanced at him from the corners of her
eyes She wished to be sociable and make up as best she could for her
rudeness on their arrival

I aint never heard but one fur honeymooners she said softly

Lets have it Ive never heard a toast for honeymooners in my life
Itll be new to mefire away

Nance fumbled her faded dress with her left hand and laughed again

May ye live long and prosper an all yer troubles be LITTLE ONES

She laughed aloud at the old wormeaten joke and Jim joined

Bully Bully old girlbully

He lifted his cup and drained it at one draught and Nance did the same

He seized the jug and poured another drink for each

Once more

He leaned across the table

And heres one for you He squared his body and lifted his cup

To all your little onesno matter how big they are

Jim drained his liquor without apparently noticing her agitation though
he was watching her keenly from the corner of his eye

The cup she held was lowered slowly until the whiskey poured over her
dress and on the floor Her thin figure drooped pathetically and her
voice was the faintest sob

IIaint gotnone

I heard you had a boy Jim said carelessly

The drooping figure shot upright as if a bolt of lightning had swept
her She stared at him in tense silence trying to gather her wits
before she answered

Who told you anything about me she demanded sternly

A fellow in New York Jim continued with studied carelessnesssaid
he used to live down here

He LIVED down here she repeated blankly

Yepcome now loosen up and tell us about the kid

There aint nuthin ter tellhes dead she cried pathetically

He said you deserted the child and left him to starve

He said that she growled

Yep

He was silent again and watched her keenly

She fumbled her dress and glanced nervously across the table as if
afraid to ask more Unable to wait for him to speak she cried nervously
at last

Wellwellwhat else did he say

That he took the little duffer to New York and raised him

RAISED him

She fairly screamed the words springing to her feet trembling from head
to foot

Till he was big enough to kick into the streets to shuffle for
himself

The scoundrel said he was dead

Her voice was far away and sank into dreamy silence She was living the
hideous lonely years again with a heart starved for love

Jims voice broke the spell

Then you didnt desert him The mans eyes held hers steadily

She stared at him blankly and spoke with rushing indignation

Desert himmy babymy own flesh and blood Theres never been a
minute since I looked into his eyes that I wouldnt a died fur him

She paused and sobbed

He had such pretty eyes stranger They looked like yournonly they
wuz puttier and bluer

She lifted her faded dress brushed the tears from her cheeks and went
on rapidly

When I found his drunken brute of a daddy was a liar and had another
wife I wouldnt live with him He tried to make me but I kicked him
out of the houseand he stole the boy to get even with me Her voice
broke she dropped her head and choked back the tears He did get even
with me toohe did she sobbed

Jim watched her in silence until the paroxysm had spent itself

You think youd know this boy now if you found him

She bent close her breath coming in quick gasps

My God mister do you think I COULD find him

He lives in New York his name is Jim Anthony

Yesyes she said in a dazed way He called hisself Walter
Anthonyhe wuz a stranger from the North and my boys name was Jim
She paused and bent eagerly across the table New Yorks an awful big
place aint it

Some town old gal take it from me

COULD I find him

If youve got money enough You said youd know him How

Id know him she answered eagerly The last quarrel we had was about
a mark on his neck He wuz a spunky little one You couldnt make him
cry His devil of a daddy used to stick pins in him and laugh because
he wouldnt cry The last dirty trick he tried was what ended it all He
pushed a live cigar agin his little neck until I smelled it burnin in
the next room I knocked him down with a chair drove him from the house
and told him Id kill him if he ever put his foot inside the door agin
He stole my boy the next nightbut hell carry that scar to his grave

Youd love this boy now if you found him in New York as bad as his
father ever was Jim asked with a curious smile

Yeshes mine was the quick firm answer

Jim watched her intently

I looked Death in the face for him she went on fiercely Id dive
to the bottom o hell to find him if I knowed he wuz thar But whats
the use to talk that devil killed him Ive waked up many a night
stranglin with a dream when I seed the drunken brute burnin an
beatin an torturin him to death The feller youve heard about aint
him Taint no use to make me hope an then kill me

Hes not dead I tell you I know

Jims voice rang with conviction so positive the old womans breath came
in quick gasps and she smiled through her eager tears

And I MIGHT find him

IF youve got money enough Money can do anything in this world

He opened the black bag thrust both hands into it and threw out a
handful of yellow coin which he allowed to pour through his fingers and
rattle into a tin plate which had been left on the table

Her eyes sparkled with avarice

Its yournall yourn she breathed hungrily

Im taking it down South to invest for a fool who thinkshe stopped
and laughedwho thinks its bad luck to keep money thats stained with
blood

Nance started back

Got blood on it

Jim spoke in confidential appeal

That wouldnt make any difference to you would it

She shook her gray locks and glanced at the pile of yellow metal
hungrily

II wouldnt like it with blood marks

He lifted a handful of coin clinked it musically in his hands and held
it in his open palms before her

Look Look at it close You dont see any blood marks on it do you

Her eyes devoured it

No

He seized her hand thrust a halfdozen pieces into it and closed her
thin fingers over it

Feel of itlook at it

Her hands gripped the gold She breathed quickly broke into a laugh
caught herself in the middle of it and lapsed suddenly into silence

Feels good dont it he laughed

Nance grinned her uneven discolored gleaming ominously in the flicker
of the candle

Dont it he repeated

Yeah

He lifted another handful and threw it in the air catching it again

Thats the stuff that makes the world go round Theres your only
friend old girl Others promise wellbut in the scratch they fail

Yeahwhen the scratch comes they fail Nance echoed

Money never fails Jim continued eagerly Its the god that knows no
right or wrong

He touched the pile in the plate and drew the bag close for her to see

How much do you guess is there

Nance gazed greedily into the open bag and looked again at the shining
heap in the plate

I dunnoa million I reckon

The man laughed

Not quite that much But enough to make you rich for lifeIF you had
it

The old woman turned away pathetically and shook her gray head

I wouldnt have to work no more would I

Her thin hands touched the faded dirty dress

And I could buy me a decent dress her voice sank to a whisper and I
could find my boy

You bet you could Jim exclaimed Theres just one god in this world
now old girlthe Almighty Dollar

He paused and leaned close persuasively

Suppose now the man that got that money had to kill a fool to take
itwhat of it You dont get big money any other way A burglar watches
his chance takes his life in his hands and drills his way into a house
He finds a fool there who fights Its not his fault that the man was
born a fool now is it

Mebbe not

Of course not A burglar kills but one to get his pile and then only
because he must in selfdefence A big gambling capitalist corners
wheat raises the price of bread and starves a hundred thousand children
to death to make his Its not stained with blood Every dollar is
soaked in it Who cares

Yeahwho cares Nance growled fiercely

Jim smiled at his easy triumph

Its dog eat dog and the devil take the hindmost now

Thats soaint it she agreed

You bet Business is business and the best mans the man that gets
there Steal a hundred dollars you go to the penitentiaryfoolish
Dont do it Steal a million and go to the Senate

Yeah Nance laughed

Moneymoney for its own sake he rushed on savagelyright or wrong
Thats all there is in it today old girltake it from me

He paused and his smile ended in a sneer

Man shall eat bread in the sweat of his brow Only fools SWEAT

Nance turned her face away sighed softly glancing back at Jim
furtively

I reckon thats so too Have another drink stranger

She poured another cup of whiskey and one for herself She raised hers
as if to drink and deftly threw the contents over her shoulder

Jim seized the jug and poured again

Once more Come Ive another toast for you Youll drink this one I
know

He lifted his cup and rose a little unsteadily Nance stood with
uplifted cup watching him

As the poet sings he began with a bow to the old woman

 France has her lily England the rose
 Everybody knows where the shamrock grows
 Scotland has her thistle flowerin on the hill
 But the American Emblemis a One Dollar Bill

He broke into a boisterous laugh

Hows that old girl

Thats bully stranger

He lifted high his cup

We drink to the Almighty Dollar

To the Almighty Dollar Nance echoed clinking her cup against his

He drained it while she again emptied hers over her shoulder

By golly youre all right old girl Youre a good fellow he cried
jovially

Yeahhave another she urged

She filled his cup and placed it on his side of the table His eye had
rested on the gold He ignored the invitation lifted a handful of gold
and dropped it with musical clinking into the plate

Blood markstommyrot he sneered

Yeahtommyrot she echoed Thats what I say too

Jim wagged his head sagely

Now youre talking sense old girl

He leaned across the table and pointed his finger straight into her
face

And dont you forget what Im tellin ye tonightget money get
money

He stopped suddenly and a sneer curled his lips

Oh I Get it fairlyget it squarelybut whatever you doby
GodGET IT

His uplifted hand crashed downward and gripped the gold His fingers
slowly relaxed and the coin clinked into the plate

Nance watched him eagerly

Yeah thats itget it she breathed slowly

Jim lifted his drooping eyes to hers

If youve GOT it youre a godyou can do no wrong Nobodys goin to
ask you HOW you got it all they want to know is HAVE you got it

Yeah nobodys goin to ask you HOW you got it Nance repeated they
just want to know HAVE you got it Yeahyeah

You bet

Jims head sank in the first stupor of liquor and he dropped into the
chair

The old woman leaned eagerly over the plate of gold and clutched the
coin with growing avarice Her fingers opened and closed like a bird
of prey She touched it lovingly and held it in her hands a long time
watching Jims nodding head with furtive glances She dropped a handful
of coin into the plate and watched its effect on the drooping head

He looked up and his eyes fell again

Bedtime I reckon Nance said

Yeppretty tired Ill turn in

The old woman glided sidewise to the table near the kitchen door picked
up the lantern and started to feel her way backwards through the calico
curtains

See you in the mornin old gal Jim drawledChristmas morninan
I got somethin else to tell ye in the mornin

Again his head sank to the table

All right mistergood night Nance answered slowly feeling her way
through the opening watching him intently

Jim lifted his head and nodded heavily for a moment His hand slipped
from the table and he drew himself up sharply and rose holding to the
table for support

He picked up the plate of coin poured it back in the bag snapped the
lock and walked with the bag unsteadily to the couch He placed the bag
under the pillow and pressed the soft feathers down over it turned back
to the table and extinguished the candle by a quick square blow of his
open palm on the flame

He staggered to the couch pushed the coats to the floor dropped
heavily drew the laprobe over him and in five minutes was sound
asleep




CHAPTER XIX NANCES STOREHOUSE


The cabin was still Only the broken sobbing of the woman in the little
shedroom came faint and low on old Nances ears

She slipped from the kitchen into the shadows of a tree near the house
and listened until the sobbing ceased

She crept close to the shed and stood silent and ghostlike beside its
daubed walls Immovable as a cat crouching in the hedge to spring on her
prey she waited until the waning moon had sunk behind the crags She
laid her ear close to a crack in the logs from which she had once pushed
the red mud to let in the light All was still at last The sobbing had
stopped The young wife was sound asleep

She had wondered vaguely at first about the crying but quickly made
up her mind that it was only a lovers quarrel She was glad of it The
girl would bar her door and sulk all night So much the better There
would be no danger of her entering the livingroom where Jim slept

She would wait a little longer to make sure she was asleep A half hour
passed The whiteshrouded figure stood immovable her keen ears tuned
for the slightest sounds from within

The stars were shining in unusual brilliance She could see her way
through the shadows even better than in full moon A wolf was crying
again for his mate from a distant crag She had grown used to his howls
He had come close to her cabin once in the daytime She had tried to
creep on him and show her friendliness But he had fled in terror at the
first glimpse of her dress through the parting underbrush

An owl was calling from his dead treetop down the valley She smiled at
his familiar tremulous call Her own eyes were wide as his tonight
No sight or sound of Nature among the crags about her cabin had for her
spirit any terror The night was her mantle

She added to the meager living which she had wrung from her mountain
farm by trading with the illicit distillers of the backwoods of Yancey
County Too ignorant to run a distillery of her own she had stored
their goods with such skill that the hidingplace had never been
discovered She loved good whiskey herself She had tried to find in its
fiery depths the dreams of happiness life had so cruelly denied her

The hidingplace of this whiskey had puzzled the revenue officers of
every administration for years They had watched her house day and
night Not one of them had ever struck the trail to her storehouse

The game had excited her imagination She loved its daring and
danger That there was the slightest element of wrong or crime in her
association with the moonshiners of her native heath had never for a
moment entered her mind It was no crime to make whiskey This was the
first article of the creed of the true North Carolina mountaineer
They had from the first declared that the tax levied by the Federal
Government on the product of their industry was an infamous act of
tyranny They had fought this tyranny for two generations They would
fight it as long as there was breath in their bodies and a single load
of powder and buckshot for their rifles

Nance considered herself a heroine in the pride of her soul for the
shrewd and successful defiance she had given the revenue officers for so
many years

She had been too cunning to even allow one of her own people to know the
secret of her store house For that reason it had never been discovered
She always stored the whiskey temporarily in the potato shed or under
the cabin floor until night and then alone carried it to the place she
had discovered

She laughed softly at the thought of this deep hidingplace tonight
Its temperature never varied winter or summer Not a track had ever been
left at its door She might live a hundred years and unless some spying
eye should see her enter its existence could never be suspected

She tipped softly into the kitchen walked to the door of the
livingroom and listened to the even heavy breathing of the man on the
couch

Once more the faint echo of a sob in the shed beyond came to her keen
ears She stood for five minutes It was not repeated She had only
imagined it The girl was still asleep

She turned noiselessly back into the kitchen put a box of matches in
her pocket felt her way to the low shelf on which she had placed the
battered lantern picked it up and shook it to make sure the oil was
sufficient

She stepped lightly into the yard pushed open the gate of the
splitboard garden fence walked along the edge to the corner and
selected a spade from the tools that leaned against the boards

Carrying the spade and unlighted lantern in her left hand she glided
from the yard into the woods Her right hand before her to feel for
underbrush or overhanging bough she made her way rapidly to the
swiftflowing mountain brook

Arrived at the water whose musical ripple had guided her steps she
removed her shoes and placed them beside a tree She wore no stockings
The faded skirt she raised and tucked into her belt She could wade knee
deep now without hindrance

Seizing the spade and lantern she made her way slowly and carefully
downstream for three hundred yards and paused beside a shelving ledge
which projected halfway across the brook

She paused and listened again for full ten minutes immovable as the
rock on which her thin bony hand rested The stars were looking but
they could only peep through the network of overhanging trees

Feeling her way along the rock until the ledge rose beyond her reach
she bent low and waded through a still pool of eddying water straight
under the mountainside for more than a hundred feet Her extended right
hand had felt for the stone ceiling above her head until it ran abruptly
out of reach

She straightened her body and took a deep breath Ten steps she counted
carefully and placed her bare feet on the dry rock beyond the water

Carefully picking her way up the sloping bank until she reached a
stretch of soft earth she sank to her hands and knees and crawled
through an opening less than three feet in height

Thar now she laughed Let em find me if they can

She lighted her lantern and seated herself on a boulder to restone
hundred and fifty feet in the depths of a mountain The cavern was ten
feet in height and fifty feet in length The projecting ledges of rock
made innumerable shelves on which a merchant might have displayed his
wares

The old woman was too shrewd for that Her jugs were carefully planted
in the ground behind two fallen boulders and their hidingplace
concealed by a layer of drift which she had gathered from the edge
of the water She had taken this precaution against the day when some
curious explorer might stumble on her secret as she had found it hunting
ginsing roots in the woods overhead Her foot had slipped suddenly
through a hole in the soft mould She peered cautiously below and could
see no bottom She dropped a stone and heard it strike in the depths
She made her way down the side of the crag and found the opening through
the still eddying waters The hole through the roof she had long ago
plugged and covered with earth and dry leaves

She carried her lantern and spade to the further end of her storehouse
and dug a hole in the earth about two feet in depth The earth she
carefully placed in a heap

Thats the place she giggled excitedly

She left her lantern burning dropped again on the soft mouldcovered
earth and quickly emerged on the stone banks of the wide still pool
Her hand high extended above her head she waded through the water until
she touched the heavy ceiling lowered her body again to a stooping
position and rapidly made her way out into the bed of the brook

She passed eagerly along the babbling path and stopped with sure
instinct at the tree beside whose trunk she had placed her shoes

In five minutes she had made her way through the woods and reached
the house She tipped into the kitchen and stood in the doorway or the
livingroom watching her sleeping guest The even breathing assured her
that all was well Her plan couldnt fail She listened again for the
sobs in the shedroom

She was sure once that she heard them Five minutes passed and still she
was uncertain To avoid any possible accident she tipped back through
the kitchen circled the house and placed her ear against the crack in
the logs

The girl was sobbingor was she praying She crouched beside the wall
waited and listened The night wind stirred the dead leaves at her feet
She lifted her head with a sudden start laughed softly and bent again
to listen




CHAPTER XX TRAPPED

The sobbing in the little room was the only sound that came from one of
the grimmest battlefields from which the soul of a woman ever emerged
alive

To the first rush of cowardly tears Mary had yielded utterly She had
fallen across the highpuffed feather mattress of the bed shivering in
humble gratitude at her escape from the horror of blindness The grip
of his clawlike fingers on her throat came back to her now in sickening
waves The blood was still trickling from the wound which his nails had
made when she tore them loose in her first mad fight for breath

She lifted her body and breathed deeply to make sure her throat was
free God in heaven Could she ever forget the hideous sinking of body
and soul down into the depths of the black abyss She had seen the face
of Death and it was horrible Life warm and throbbing was sweet She
loved it She hated Death

Yesshe was a coward She knew it now and didnt care

She sprang to her feet with sudden fear He might attack her again to
make sure that her soul had been completely crushed

She crept to the door and felt its edges

Yes thank God theres a place for the bar She shivered

She ran her trembling fingers carefully along the rough logs and found
it in the corner She slipped it cautiously into the iron sockets
staggered to the bed and dropped in grateful assurance of safety for the
moment She buried her face in the pillow to fight back the sobs How
great her fall She could crawl on her hands and knees to Jane Anderson
now and beg for protection The last shred of pretense was gone The
bankrupt soul stood naked and shivering the last rag torn from pride

What a miserable fight she had made too when put to the test Ella had
at least proved herself worthy to live The scrubwoman had risen in the
strength of desperation and killed the beast who had maimed her She had
only sunk a limp mass of shivering helpless cowardice and fled from the
room whining and pleading for mercy

She could never respect herself again The scene came back in vivid
flashes His eyes glowing like two balls of blue fire froze the blood
in her veinshis voice the rasping cold steel of a file And this
coarse ugly beast had held her in the spell of love She had clung to
him kissed him in rapture and yielded herself to him soul and body And
he had gripped her delicate throat and choked her into insensibility
dropping her limp form from his hands like a strangled rat She could
remember the halfconscious moment that preceded the total darkness as
she felt his grip relax

He would choke and beat her again too He had said it in the sneering
laughter at the door

A good little wife now and its all right

And if youre not obedient to my whims Ill choke you until you are
That was precisely what he meant That he was capable of any depth of
degradation and that he meant to drag her with him there could be no
longer the shadow of a doubt

She could not endure another scene like that She sprang to her feet
again shivering with terror She could hear the hum of the conversation
in the next room He was persuading his mother to join in his criminal
career He was busy with his oily tongue transforming the simple
ignorant lonely old woman into an avaricious fiend who would receive
his bloodstained booty and rejoice in it

He was laughing again She put her trembling hands over her ears to shut
out the sound He had laughed at her shame and cowardice It made her
flesh creep to hear it

She would escape The mountain road was dark and narrow and crooked She
would lose her way in the night perhaps No matter She could keep
warm by walking At dawn she would find her way to a cabin and ask
protection If she could reach Asheville a telegram would bring
her father She wouldnt lose a minute Her hat and coat were in the
livingroom She would go bareheaded and without a coat In the morning
she could borrow one from the woman at the Mount Mitchell house

She crept cautiously along the walls of the room searching for a door or
window There must be a way out She made the round without discovering
an opening of any kind There must be a window of some kind high up for
ventilation There was no glass in it of course It was closed by a
board shutterif she could reach it

She began at the door found the corner of the room and stretched her
arms upward until they touched the low rough joist Over every foot of
its surface she ran her fingers carefully feeling for a window There
was none

She found an open crack and peered through The stars were shining cold
and clear in the December sky The twinkling heavens reminded her that
it was Christmas Eve The dawn she hoped to see in the woods if she
could escape would be Christmas morning There was no time for idle
tears of selfpity

The one thought that beat in every throb of her heart now was to escape
from her cell and put a thousand miles between her body and the beast
who had strangled her She might break through the roof As a rule the
shedrooms of these rude mountain cabins were covered with split boards
lightly nailed to narrow strips eighteen inches apart If there were
no ceiling or if the ceiling were not nailed down and she should
move carefully she might break through near the eaves and drop to the
ground The cabin was not more than nine feet in height

She raised herself on the footrail of the bed and felt the ceiling
There could be no mistake It was there She pressed gently at first and
then with all her might against each board They were nailed hard and
fast

She sank to the bed again in despair She had barred herself in a prison
cell There was no escape except by the door through which the beast had
driven her And he would probably draw the couch against it and sleep
there

And then came the crushing conviction that such flight would be of no
avail in a struggle with a man of Jims character His laughing words of
triumph rang through her soul now in all their full sinister meaning

The world aint big enough for you to get away from me Kiddo

It wasnt big enough She knew it with tragic and terrible certainty In
his blind brutal way he loved her with a savage passion that would halt
at nothing He would follow her to the ends of the earth and kill any
living thing that stood in his way And when he found her at last he
would kill her

How could she have been so blind There was no longer any mystery about
his personality The slender hands and feet which she had thought
beautiful in her infatuation were merely the hands and feet of a thief
The strength of jaw and neck and shoulders had made him the most daring
of all thievesa burglar

His strange moods were no longer strange He laughed for joy at the wild
mountain gorges and crags because he saw safety for the hidingplace of
priceless jewels he meant to steal

There could be no escape in divorce from such a brute He was happy in
her cowardly submission He would laugh at the idea of divorce Should
she dare to betray the secrets of his life of crime he would kill her
as he would grind a snake under his heel

A single clause from the marriage ceremony kept ringing its
knelluntil DEATH DO US PART

She knelt at last and prayed for Death

Oh dear God let me die let me die

Suicide was a crime unthinkable to her pious mind Only God now could
save her in his infinite mercy

She lay for a long time on the floor where she had fallen in utter
despair The tears that brought relief at first had ceased to flow
She had beaten her bleeding wings against every barrier and they were
beyond her strength

Out of the first stupor of complete surrender her senses slowly
emerged She felt the bare boards of the floor and wondered vaguely why
she was there

The hum of voices again came to her ears She lay still and listened
A single terrible sentence she caught He spoke it with such malignant
power she could see through the darkness the flames of hell leaping in
his eyes

Nobodys going to ask you HOW you got itall they want to know is HAVE
you got it

She laughed hysterically at the idea of reformation that had stirred her
to such desperate appeal in the first shock of discovery As well dream
of reforming the Devil as the man who expressed his philosophy of
life in that sentence Blood dripped from every word the blood of the
innocent and the helpless who might consciously or unconsciously stand
in his way The man who had made up his mind to get rich quick no
matter what the cost to others would commit murder without the quiver
of an eyelid If she had ever had a doubt of this fact she could have
none after her experience of tonight

She wondered vaguely of the effects he was producing on his ignorant
old mother Her words were too low and indistinct to be heard But she
feared the worst The temptation of the gold he was showing her would be
more than she could resist

She staggered to her feet and fell limp across the bed The iron walls
of a life prison closed about her crushed soul The one door that could
open was Death and only Gods hand could lift its bars




CHAPTER XXI THE DEVILS DISCIPLE


Hour after hour Nance stood beside the wall of the shedroom and with
the patience of a cat waited for the sobs to cease and the girl to be
quiet

Mary had risen from the bed once and paced the floor in the dark for
more than an hour like a frightened wild animal trapped and caged for
the first time in life With growing wonder Nance counted the beat
of her footfall five steps one way and five backround after round
round after round in ceaseless repetition

Goddlemighty is she gone clean crazy she exclaimed

The footsteps stopped at last and the low sobs came once more from the
bed The old woman crouched down on a stone beside the log wall and drew
the shawl about her shoulders

A rooster crowed for midnight Still the restless thing inside was
stirring Nance rose uneasily Her lantern was still burning in her
storehouse under the cliff The wick might eat so low it would explode
She had heard that such things happened to lamps It was foolish to have
left it burning anyhow

She glided noiselessly from the house into the woods entered her hidden
door exactly as she had done before extinguished the lantern placed it
on a shelving rock and put a dozen matches beside it

In ten minutes she had returned to the house and crouched once more
against the wall of the shed

The low pleading voice was praying She pressed her ear to the crack
and heard distinctly She must be patient Her plan was sure to succeed
if she were only patient No woman could sob and pray and walk all
night She must fall down unconscious from sheer exhaustion before day

The old woman slipped into the kitchen took up the quilt which she had
spread on the floor for her bed wrapped it about her thin shoulders and
returned to her watch

Again and again she rose believing her patience had won and placed
her ear to the crack only to hear a sound within which told her only too
plainly that the girl was yet awake Sometimes it was a sigh sometimes
she cleared her throat sometimes she tossed restlessly One spoken
sentence she heard again and again

Oh dear God have mercy on my lost soul

What can be the matter with the fool critter Nance muttered Is she
moanin for sin To be shore they dont have no revival meetings this
time o year

She had known sinners to mourn through a whole summer sometimes but
never in all her experience in religious revivals had a mourner carried
it over into winter The dancing had always eased the tension and
brought a relapse to sinful thoughts

The hours dragged until the roosters began to crow for day It would
soon be light

She must act now There was no time to lose She pressed her ear to the
crack once more and held it five minutes

Not a sound came from within The broken spirit had yielded to the
stupor of exhaustion at last

With swift cats tread Nance circled the cabin and entered the kitchen
The quilt she carefully spread on the floor leading to the entrance to
the livingroom crossed it softly and stood in the doorway with her
long hands on the calico hangings

For five minutes she remained immovable and listened to the deep
regular breathing of the sleeping man Her wits were keen her eyes
wide She could see the dim outlines of the furniture by the starlight
through the window Small objects in the room were of course
invisible To light a candle was not to be thought of It might wake the
sleeper

She knew how to make the light without a noise or its rays reaching
his face He had startled her with the electric torch because of its
novelty She was no longer afraid She would know how to press the
button He had left the thing lying on the table beside the black bag
He might have hidden the gold He would not remember in his drunken
stupor to move the electric torch

She glided ghostlike into the room Her bare feet were velvet She knew
every board in the floor There was one near the table that creaked She
counted her steps and cleared the spot without a sound

Her thin fingers found the edge of the table and slipped with uncanny
touch along its surface until her hand closed on the rounded form of the
torch

Without moving in her tracks she turned the light on the table and in
every nook and corner of the room beyond She slowly swung her body on a
pivot flashing the light into each shadow and over every inch of floor
turning always in a circle toward the couch

Satisfied that the object she sought was nowhere in the circle she had
covered she moved a step from the table and winked the light beneath
it She squatted on the floor and flashed it carefully over every inch
of its boards from one corner of the room to the other and under the
couch

She rose softly glided behind the head of the sleeping man and stood
back some six feet lest the flash of the torch might disturb him
She threw its rays behind the couch and slowly raised them until they
covered the dirty pillow on which Jim was sleeping There beneath the
pillow lay the bag with its precious treasure He was sleeping on it
She had feared this but felt sure that the whiskey he had drunk would
hold him in its stupor until late next morning

She crouched low and fixed the lights ray slowly on the bag that her
hand might not err the slightest in its touch She laid her bony fingers
on it with a slow imperceptible movement held them there a moment and
moved the bag the slightest bit to test the sleepers wakefulness To
her surprise he stirred instantly

Whatell he growled sleepily

She stood motionless until he was breathing again with deep even heavy
throb Gliding back to the table she flashed the light again on the
bag and studied its position His big neck rested squarely across it To
move it without waking him was a physical impossibility

Here was a dilemma she had not fully faced She had not believed it
possible for him to place the bag where she could not get it Her
only purpose up to this moment had been to take it and store it safely
beneath the soft earth in the inner recess of the cave He would miss
it in the morning of course She would express her amazement The bar
would be down from the front door Someone had robbed him The money
could never be found

She had made up her mind to take it the moment he had convinced her that
his philosophy of life was true His eloquence had transformed her
from an ignorant old woman content with her poverty and dirt into a
dangerous and daring criminal

There was no such thing as failure to be thought of now for a moment
The spade in the inner room of her storehouse could be put to larger
use if necessary With the strength of the madness now on her she could
carry his body on her back through the woods The world would be none
the wiser He had quarreled with his wife and left her in a rage that
night That was all she knew The sheriff of neither county could
afford to bother his head long over an insolvable mystery Besides both
sheriffs were her friends

Her decision was instantaneous when once she saw that it was safe

She smiled over the grim irony of the thinghis words kept humming in
her ears his voice low and persuasive

Suppose now the man that got that money had to kill a fool to take
itwhat of it You dont get big money any other way

On the shelf beside the door was a butcher knife which she also used for
carving She had sharpened its point that night to carve her Christmas
turkey next day

She raised the torch and flashed its rays on the shelf to guide her
hand crept to the wall took down the knife and laid the electric torch
in its place

Steadying her body against the wall her arms outspread she edged
her way behind the couch and bent over the sleeping man until by his
breathing she had located his heart

She raised her tall figure and brought the knife down with a crash into
his breast With a sudden wrench she drew it from the wound and crouched
among the shadows watching him with widedilated eyes

The stricken sleeper gasped for breath his writhing body fairly
leaped into the air bounded on the couch and stood erect He staggered
backward and lurched toward her The crouching figure bent low gripping
the knife and waiting for her chance to strike the last blow

Strangling with blood Jim opened his eyes and saw the old woman
creeping nearer through the gray light of the dawn

He threw his hands above his head and tried to shout his warning She
was on him her trembling hand feeling for his throat before he could
speak

Struggling in his weakened condition to tear her fingers away he
gasped

Here Here Great God Do you know what youre doing

I just want yer money she whispered Thats all and Im agoin ter
have it

Her fingers closed and the knife sank into his neck

She sprang back and watched him lurch and fall across the couch His
body writhed a moment in agony and was still

Holding the knife in her hand she tore open the bag and thrust her
itching fingers into the gold gripping it fiercely

Nobodys goin to ask ye how ye got itthey just want to know HAVE ye
got ityeah Yeah

The last word died on her lips The door of the shedroom suddenly
opened and Mary stood before her




CHAPTER XXII DELIVERANCE

The first dim noises of the tragedy in the livingroom Marys stupefied
senses had confused with a nightmare which she had been painfully
fighting

The torch in Nances hand had flashed through a crack into her face
once It was the flame of a revolver in the hands of a thief in Jims
den in New York She merely felt it Her eyes had been gouged out and
she was blind A gang of his coarse companions were holding a council
cursing drinking fighting Jim had sprung between two snarling brutes
and knocked the revolver into the air The flame had scorched her face

With an oath he had slapped her

Get out you damned little fool he growled Youre always in the way
when youre not wanted Nobody can ever find you when theres work to be
done

But I cant see Jim dear she pleaded I do not know when things are
out of place

Youre a liar he roared You know where every piece of junk stands
in this room better than I do I cant bring a friend into that door
that you dont know it You can hear the swish of a womans skirt on the
stairs four stories below

I only asked you who the woman was who came in with you Jim

His fingers gripped her throat and stopped her breath Through the roar
of surging blood she could barely hear the vile words he was dinning
into her ears

I know you just asked me you nosing little devil and its none of
your business Shes a pal of mine if you want to know the slickest
thief that ever robbed a flat Shes got more sense in a minute than
youll ever have in a lifetime Shes going to live here with me now
You can sleep on the cot in the kitchen And you come when she calls
if you know whats good for your lazy hide Ive told her to thrash the
life out of you if you dare to give her any impudence

She had cowered at his feet and begged him not to beat her again The
fumes of whiskey and stale beer filled the place

Jim turned from her to quell a new fight at the other end of the room
Another woman was there coarse dirty beastly She drew a knife and
demanded her share of the nights robberies She was trying to break
from the men who held her to stab Jim They were all fighting and
smashing the furniture

She sprang from the bed with a cry of horror The noise was real It was
not a dream The beast inside was stumbling in the dark His passions
fired by liquor he was fumbling to find his way into her room

She rushed to the door and put her shoulder against the bar panting in
terror

She heard his strangling cry

Here Here Great God Do you know what youre doing

And then his mothers voice mad with greed cruel merciless

I just want yer moneythats all an Im goin to have it

She heard the clinch in the struggle and the dull blow of the knife
In a sudden flash she saw it all He had succeeded in rousing Nances
avarice and transforming her into a fiend Without knowing it she was
stabbing her own son to death in the room in which he had been born

She tried to scream and her lips refused to move She tried to hurry to
the rescue and her knees turned to water

Gasping for breath she drew the bar from her prison door and walked
slowly into the room

Nances tall bony figure was still crouched over the open bag her
left hand buried in the gold her right gripping the knife her face
convulsed with greedavarice and murder blended into perfect helllit
unity at last

Jim lay on his back limp and still obliquely across the couch his
breast bared in the struggle the blood oozing a widening scarlet blot
on his white shirt His head had fallen backward over the edge and could
not be seen

Without moving a muscle her body crouching Nance spoke

You wuz awakeyou heered

Yes

The gleaming eyes burned through the gray dawn two points of
scintillating hellish light fixed in purpose on the intruder

She had only meant to take the money The fool had fought She killed
him because she had to And now the sobbing sniveling little idiot who
had kept her waiting all night had stuck her nose into some thing that
didnt concern her If she opened her mouth the gallows would be the
end

She would open it too Of course she would She was his wife They had
quarreled but the simpleton would blab Nance knew this with unerring
instinct It was no use to offer her half the money She didnt have
sense enough to take it She knew those pious baby faceswell there
was room for two in the cave under the cliff It was daylight now No
matter it was Christmas morning No man or woman ever darkened her door
on Christmas day She could hide their bodies until dark and then it
was easy She would be in New York herself before anyone could suspect
the meaning of that automobile in the shed or the owners would trouble
themselves to come after it

Again her decision was quick and fierce Her hand was on the bag She
would hold it against the world all hell and heaven

With the leap of a tigress she was on the girl the bag gripped in her
left hand the knife in her right

To her amazement the trembling figure stood stock still gazing at her
with a strange look of pity

Well Nance growled I aint goin ter be took now Ive got this
moneyIm goin to New York ter find my boy

She lifted the knife and stopped in sheer stupor of surprise at the
girls immovable body and staring eyes Had she gone crazy What on
earth could it mean No girl of her youth and beauty could look death
in the face without a tremor No woman in her right senses could see
the body of her dead husband lying there red and yet quivering without a
sign It was more than even Nances nerves could endure

She lowered the knife and peered into the girls set face and glanced
quickly about the room Could she have called help Was the house
surrounded It was impossible She couldnt have escaped What did it
mean

The old woman drew back with a terror she couldnt understand

What are you looking at me like that for she panted

Mary held her gaze in lingering pity Her heart went out now to the
miserable creature trembling in the presence of her victim The blow
must fall that would crush the soul out of her body at one stroke The
gray hair had tumbled over her distorted features the ragged dress had
been torn from her throat in the struggle and her flat bony breast was
exposed

You donthavetogotoNew Yorktofindyourboy the
strained voice said at last

Nance frowned in surprise and flew back at her in rage

Yes I do toohe lives thar

The little figure straightened above the crouching form

Hes here

Nance sank slowly against the table and rested the bag on the edge of
the chair Its weight was more than she could bear She tried to glance
over her shoulder at the body on the couch and her courage failed The
first suspicion of the hideous truth flashed through her stunned mind
She couldnt grasp it at once

Whar she whispered hoarsely

Mary lifted her arm slowly and pointed to the couch

There

Nance glared at her a moment and broke into a hysterical laugh

Its a liea liea lie

Its true

Yerre just a lyin ter me ter get away an give me upbut ye wont do
itlittle Missold Nance is too smart for ye this time Who told you
that

He told me tonight

He told you she repeated blankly

Yes

Youre a liar she growled And Ill prove ityou move out o your
tracks an Ill cut your throat My boys got a scar on his neckI know
right whar to look for it Dont you move now till I seeI know youre
a liar

She turned and with the quick trembling fingers of her right hand tore
the shirt back from the neck and saw the scar She still held the bag
in her left hand The muscles slowly relaxed and the bag fell endwise to
the floor the gold crashing and rolling over the boards She stared in
stupor and threw both hands above her streaming gray hair

Lord God Almighty she shrieked Why didnt I think that he wuz
somebody elses boy if he werent mine

The thin body trembled and crumpled beside the couch

The girl lifted her head in a look of awe as if in prayer

And God has set me free free free





CHAPTER XXIII THE DOCTOR

Mary stood overwhelmed by the tragedy she had witnessed For the time
her brain refused to record sensations She had seen too much felt too
much in the past eight hours Soul and body were numb

The first impressions of returning consciousness were fixed on Nance
She had risen suddenly from the floor and smoothed the hair back from
Jims forehead with tender touch as if afraid to wake him She drew the
quilt from the kitchen floor spread it over the body and lifted her
eyes to Marys It was only too plain

Reason had gone

She tipped close and put her fingers on her lips

Sh We mustnt wake him Hes tired Let him sleep Its my boy Hes
come home Well fix him a fine Christmas dinner Ive got a turkey
Ill bake a cake she paused and laughed softly Ive got eggs too
fresh laid yesterday Well make eggnog all day and all night I aint
had no Christmas since that devil stole him Well have one this time
wont we

The girls wits were again alert She must run for help A minute to
humor the old womans delusion and she might return before any harm
came to her Jim had not moved a muscle It was plain that he was beyond
help

Yes Mary answered cheerfully You fix the cakeand Ill get the
wood to make a fire

Nance laughed again

Well have the dinner all ready for him when he wakes wont we

Yes Ill be back in a few minutes

Nance hurried into the kitchen humming an old song in a faltering voice
that sent the cold chills down the girls spine

Mary slipped quietly through the door and ran with swift sure foot down
the narrow road along which the machine had picked its way the afternoon
before The cabin they had passed last could not be more than a mile

She made no effort to find the logs for pedestrians when the road
crossed the brook She plunged straight through the babbling waters with
her shoes regardless of skirts

Panting for breath she saw the smoke curling from the cabin chimney a
quarter of a mile away

Thank God she cried Theyre awake

She was so glad to have reached her goal her strength suddenly gave way
and she dropped to a boulder by the wayside to rest In two minutes she
was up and running with all her might

She rushed to the door and knocked

A mountaineer in shirtsleeves and stockings answered with a look of
mild wonder

For Gods sake come and help me I must have a doctor quick We spent
the night at Mrs Owens Shes lost her mind completelya terrible
thing has happenedyoull help me

Cose I will honey the mountaineer drawled Jest ez quick ez I get
on my shoes

Is there a doctor near she asked breathlessly

He answered without looking up

The best one that God ever sent to a sick bed He dont charge nobody
a cent in these parts He just heals the sick because hits his callin
Come from somewhar up North and built hisself a fine log house up on
the side of the mountains Hits full of all the medicines in the world
too

Will you ask him to come for me Mary broke in

Ill jump on my hoss an have him thar in half a hour You can run
right back honey and look out for the po ole critter till we get
thar

Thank you Thank you she answered grate fully

Not at all not at all he protested as he swung through the door
and hurried to the lowpitched sheds in which his horse and cow were
stabled Be thar in no time

When Mary returned Nance was still busy in the kitchen She had built a
fire and put the turkey in the oven

Mary was counting the minutes now until the doctor should come The old
womans prattle about the return of her lost boy so big and strong and
handsome had become unendurable She felt that she should scream and
collapse unless help came at once She looked at her watch It was just
thirtyfive minutes from the time she had left the cabin in the valley
below

She sprang to her feet with a smothered cry of joy The beat of a
horses hoof at full gallop was ringing down the road

In two minutes the Doctors firm footstep was heard at the kitchen door

Nance turned with a look of glad surprise

Well fur the land sake ef hit aint Doctor Mulford Come right in
she cried

The Doctor seized her hand

And how is my good friend Mrs Owens this morning he asked
cheerfully

Mary was studying him with deep interest She had asked herself the
question a hundred times how much she could tell himwhat to say and
what to leave unsaid One glance at his calm intellectual face was
enough He was a man of striking appearance six feet tall fortyfive
years of age hair prematurely gray and a slight stoop to his broad
shoulders His brown eyes seemed to enfold the old woman in their
sympathy

Nance was chattering her answer to his greeting

Oh Im feelin fine Doctor she dropped her voice
confidentiallyand youre just in time for a good dinner My boy that
was lost has come home Hes a great big fellow wears fine clothes and
come up the mountain all the way in a devil wagon She put her hand
to her mouth Sh Hes asleep We wont wake him till dinner Hes all
tired out

The Doctor nodded understandingly and turned toward Mary

And this young lady

Oh thats his wife from New Yorkaint she purty

The Doctor saw the delicate hands trembling and extended his

No word was spoken None was needed There was healing in his touch
healing in his whole being No man or woman could resist the appeal of
his personality Their secrets were yielded with perfect faith

Come with me quickly Mary whispered

I understand he answered carelessly

Turning again to Nance he said with easy confidence

Ill not disturb you with your cooking Mrs Owens Go right on with
it Ill have a little chat with your sons wife If shes from New York
I want to ask her about some of my people up there

All right Nance answered but dont you wake HIM Go with her inter
the shedroom

Well go on tiptoe the Doctor whispered

Nance nodded smiled and bent again over the oven

Mary led him quickly through the livingroom head averted from the
couch and into the prison cell in which she had passed the night The
physician glanced with a startled look at the gold still scattered on
the floor

She seized his hand and swayed

He touched the brown hair of her bared head gently and pressed her hand

Steady now child tell me quickly

Yes yes she gasped Ill tell you the truth

He held her gaze

And the whole truthits best

Mary nodded tried to speak and failed She drew her breath and steadied
herself still gripping his hand

I will she began faintly Hes dead

She paused and nodded toward the livingroom

The manher son

Yes We came last night from Asheville We were on our honeymoon We
havent been married but three weeks I never knew the truth about his
life and character until last night when he told me that this old woman
was his mother I found a case of jewels in the bag he carriedjewels
that belonged to a man in New York who was robbed and shot I recognized
the case He confessed to me at last in cold brutal words that he was
a thief I couldnt believe it at first I tried to make him give up his
criminal career He laughed at me He gloried in it I tried to leave
him He choked me into insensibility and drove me into this cell where
I spent the night He brought the gold that you saw on the floor which
he had honestly made to give to his old motherbut for a devilish
purpose He showed it to her last night to rouse her avarice and make
her first agree to hide his stolen goods He succeeded too well Before
he had revealed himself she slipped into the room at daylight while he
slept in a drunken stupor murdered him and took the money The struggle
waked me and I rushed in She gripped her knife to kill me I told her
that she had murdered her own son and she went mad

She paused for breath and her lips trembled piteously

You know what to do Doctor

Yes

And youll help me

He smiled tenderly and nodded his head

God knows you need it child

The nerves snapped at last and she sank a limp heap at his feet




CHAPTER XXIV THE CALL DIVINE

The Doctor threw off his coat and took charge of the stricken house He
sent his waiting messenger for a faithful nurse a mountain woman whom
he had trained and began the fight for Marys life The collapse into
which she had fallen would require weeks of patient care There was no
immediate danger of death and while he awaited the arrival of help he
turned into the livingroom to examine the body of the slain husband

The head had fallen backward over the side of the lounge and a pool of
blood still warm and red lay on the floor in a widening circle beneath
it His quick eye took in its significance at a glance He sprang
forward ripped the shirt wide open and applied his ear to the breast

Hes still alive he cried excitedly

He examined the ugly wound in the left side and found that the knife
had penetrated the lung The heart had not been touched The blow on the
neck had not been fatal The shock of the final stroke had merely choked
the wounded man into collapse from the hemorrhage of the left lung The
position into which the body had fallen across the couch had gradually
cleared the accumulated blood There was a chance to save his life

In ten minutes he had applied stimulants and restored respiration
but the deep wheeze from the stricken lung told only too plainly the
dangerous character of the wound It would be a bitter fight His
enormous vitality might win The chances were against him

Jims lips moved and he tried to speak

The Doctor placed his hand on his mouth and shook his head The drooping
eyelids closed in grateful obedience

The beat of horses hoofs echoed down the mountain road His nurse and
messenger were coming He decided at once to move Mary to his own house
She must regain consciousness in new surroundings or her chance of
survival would be slender To awake in this miserable cabin the scene
of the tragedy she had witnessed might be instantly fatal Besides she
must not yet know that the brute who had choked her was alive and might
still hold the power of life and death over her frail body She believed
him dead It was best so He might be dead and buried before she
recovered consciousness The fever that burned her brain would
completely cloud reason for days

He hastily improvised a stretcher with a blanket and two strong
quiltingpoles which stood in the corner of the room Nance helped him
without question She obeyed his slightest suggestion with childlike
submission

He placed Mary on the stretcher wrapped her body in another warm
blanket and turned to his nurse and messenger

Carry her to my house Walk slowly and rest whenever you wish
Dont wake her Tell Aunt Abbie to put her to bed in the south room
overlooking the valley Dont leave her a minute Betty Shes in the
first collapse of brain fever You know what to do Ill be there in an
hour You come back here John I want you

The mountaineer nodded and seized one end of the stretcher The nurse
took up the other and the Doctor held wide the cabin door as they passed
out

For three weeks he fought the grim battle with Death for the two young
lives the Christmas tragedy had thrust into his hands He gave his
entire time day and night to the desperate struggle

When pneumonia had developed and Jims life hung by a hair he slept on
the couch in the livingroom of the cabin and had Nance make for herself
a bed on the floor of the kitchen

The old woman remained an obedient child She cooked the Doctors meals
and did the work about the house and yard as if nothing had disturbed
her habits of lonely plodding She believed implicitly all that was told
her Her son had pneumonia from cold he had taken in the long drive from
Asheville The house must be kept quiet John Sanders was helping her
nurse him She was sure the Doctor would save him

Even the knife with which she had stabbed him made no impression on
her numbed senses The Doctor had scoured every trace of blood from the
blade and put it back in its place on the shelf lest she should miss it
and ask questions She used it daily without the slightest memory of the
frightful story it might tell

Each morning before going to the cabin the Doctor watched with patience
for the first signs of returning consciousness in Marys feverwracked
body The day she lifted her grateful eyes to his and her lips moved in
a tremulous question he raised his hand gently

Sh Childdont talk Its all right Youre getting better Ive
been with you every day Youre in my house now Youll soon be yourself
again

She smiled wanly put her delicate hand on his and pressed it
gratefully

I understand You thank meyou say that I am good to you But Im
not This is my life I heal the sick because I must I love this battle
royal with Death He beats me sometimesbut I never quit Im always
tramping on his trail and Ive won this fight

The calm brown eyes held her in a spell and she smiled again

Sleep now he said soothingly Sleep day and night Just wake to take
a little foodthats all and Nature will do the rest

He stroked her hand gently until her eyelids closed

Two days later Jim clung to the Doctors hand and insisted on talking

Better wait a little longer boy the physician answered kindly
Youre not out of the woods yet

I cant waitDoc Jim pleaded Ive just got to ask you
something

All right You can talk five minutes

My wife Doc how is she You took her to your house John told me
Shell get well

Yes Shes rapidly recovering now

What does she say about me

She thinks youre dead

You havent told her

No

Why

She had all she could stand

Jim stared in silence

You think shed be sorry to know I am alive he asked slowly

It would be a great shock

The steel blue eyes slowly filled with tears

God I am rotten aint I

Theres no doubt about that my son was the firm answer

Why did you fight so hard to save meI wonder

An old feud between Death and me

Jim suddenly seized the Doctors hand

Say you cant fool meyoure a good one Doc Youve been a friend to
me and youve got to help nowyouve just got to Youre the only one
on earth who can Youve a great big heart and you cant go back on a
fellow thats down and out Give me a chance You willwont you

The hot fingers gripped the Doctors hand with pleading tenderness

The brown eyes searched Jims soul

If you can show me its worth while

The fingers tightened their grip in silence

Just give me a chance Doc he said at last and Ill show you I
aint never had a chance to really know what was right and what was
wrong If Id a lived here with my old mother shed have told me You
know what it is to be a stray dog on the streets of New York Even then
Id have kept straight if I hadnt been robbed by a lawyer and his
pal I didnt know what I was doin till that night here in this
cabinhonest to God I didnt

He paused for breath and a tear stole down his cheek He fought for
control of his emotions and went on in low tones

I didnt knowtill I saw my old mother creepin on me in the shadows
with that big knife gleamin in her hand I tried to stop her and I
couldnt I tried to yell and strangled with blood I saw the flames of
hell in her eyes and I had kindled them thereGod I never knew until
that minute Im broken and bruised lyin on the rocks now in the
lowest pit Give me your hand Doc Youre my only friendIm goin
straight from now onso help me God

He paused again for breath and sought the actors eyes

Youll stand by me wont you

A friendly grip closed on the trembling fingers

YesIll help youif I can




CHAPTER XXV THE MOTHER

Mary was resting in the chair beneath the southern windows of the
sunparlor of the Doctors bungalow He had built his home of logs
cut from the mountainside Its rooms were supplied with every modern
convenience and comfort Clear spring water from the cliff above poured
into the cypress tank constructed beneath the roof An overflow pipe
sent a sparkling bubbling and laughing through the lawn refreshing the
wild flowers planted along its edges

The view from the window looking south was one of ravishing beauty and
endless charm Perched on a rising spur of the Black Mountain the house
commanded a view of the long valley of the Swannanoa opening at
the lower end into the wide sunlit sweep of the lower hills around
Asheville Upward the balsamcrowned peaks towered among the clouds and
stars

No two hours of the day were just alike Sometimes the sun was raining
showers of diamonds on the trembling treetops of the valleys while the
blackest storm clouds hung in ominous menace around Mount Mitchell and
the Cattail Sometimes it was raining in the valleythe rain cloud a
level sheet of gray cloth stretching from the foot of the lawn across to
the crags beyond while the sun wrapped the little bungalow in a warm
white mantle

Mary had never tired of this enchanted world during the days of her
convalescence The Doctor with firm will had lifted every care from
her mind She had gratefully submitted to his orders and asked no
questions

She began to wonder vaguely about his life and people and why he had
left the world in which a man of his culture and power must have moved
to bury himself in these mountain wilds She wondered if he had married
separated from his wife and chosen the life of a recluse He volunteered
no information about himself

When not attending his patients he spent his hours in the greenhouse
among his flowers or in the long library extension of the bungalow
More than five thousand volumes filled the solid shelves A massive oak
table ten feet in length and four feet wide stood in the center of the
room always generously piled with books magazines and papers At the
end of this table he kept the row of books which bore immediately on the
theme he was studying

Beside the window opening on the view of the valley stood his
oldfashioned desksix feet long its top a labyrinth of pigeonholes
and tiny drawers

He pursued his studies with boyish enthusiasm and chattered of them to
Mary by the hourwith never a word passing his lips about himself

Aunt Abbie the cook brought her a cup of tea and Mary volunteered a
question

Do you know the Doctors people Auntie she asked hesitatingly

Lord child hes a mystery to everybody All we know is that hes
the best man that ever walked the earth He wont talk and the mountain
folks are too polite to nose into his business He saved my boys life
one summer and when he was strong and well and went back to Asheville
to his work I had nothin to do but to hold my hands and I come here
to cook for him He tries to pay me wages but I laugh at him I told him
if he could save my boys life for nothin I reckon I could cook him a
few good meals without pay

Her eyes filled with tears She brushed them off laughed and added

He lets me alone now and dont pester me no more about money

Her tea and toast finished Mary placed the tray on the table rose with
a sudden look of pain and made her way slowly to the library

A warm fire of hardwood logs sparkled in the big stone fireplace The
Doctor was out on a visit to a patient He had given her the freedom of
the place and had especially insisted that she use his books and make
his library her resting place whenever her mind was fagged She had
spent many quiet hours in its inspiring atmosphere

She seated herself at his desk and studied the calendar which hung above
it A sudden terror overwhelmed her she buried her face in her arms and
burst into tears

She was still lying across the desk sobbing when the Doctor walked
into the room

He touched her hair reproachfully with his firm hand

Why whats this My little soldier has disobeyed orders

I dont want to live now she sobbed

And why not

IIam going to be a mother she whispered

So

The mother of a criminal Oh Doctor its horrible Why did you let me
live The hell I passed through that night was enoughGod knows This
will be unendurable Ive made up my mindIll die first

Rubbish child Rubbish he answered with a laugh Where did you get
all this misinformation

You know what my husband was How can you ask

Because I happen to know also his wifethe mothertobe of this
supposed criminal who has just set sail for the shores of our
planetand I know that she is one of the purest and sweetest souls who
ever lost her way in the jungles of the world If you were the criminal
dear heart the case might be hopeless But youre not You are only
the innocent victim of your own folly That doesnt count in the game of
Nature

What do you mean she asked breathlessly

Simply this The part which the male plays in the reproduction of the
race is small in comparison with the role of the female He is merely
a supernumerary who steps on the stage for a moment and speaks one word
announcing the arrival of the queen The queen is the mother She plays
the star role in the drama of Heredity She is never off the stage for a
single moment We inherit the most obvious physical traits from our male
ancestors but even these may be modified by the will of the mother

Modified by the will of the mother she repeated blankly

Certainly There are yet long days and weeks and months before your
babe will be bornat least seven months Theres not a sight or sound
of earth or heaven that can reach or influence this coming human being
save through your eyes and ears and touch and soul Almighty God can
speak His message only through you You are his ambassador on earth in
this solemn hour What your husband was is of little importance There
is not a moment waking or sleeping day or night that does not bring
to you its divine opportunity This human life is yoursabsolutely to
mold and fashion in body and mind as you will

Youre just saying this to keep me from suicide Mary interrupted

I am telling you the simplest truth of physical life You can even
change the contour of your babys head if you like You think in your
silly fears that the bull neck and jaw of the father will reappear
in the child It might be so unless you see fit to change it All any
father can do is to transmit general physical traits unless modified by
the will of the mother

You mean that I can choose even the personal appearance of my child
she asked in blank amazement

Exactly that Choose the type of man you wish your babe to be and it
shall be so Who in all the world would you prefer that he resemble

You she answered promptly

He smiled gently

That pays me for all my trouble child No doctor ever got a bigger
fee than that Banks may fail but Ill never lose it Your choice
simplifies that matter very much You wont need a picture in your
room

A picture could determine the features of an unborn babe she asked
incredulously

Beyond a doubt and it will determine character sometimes I knew a
mother in the mountains of Vermont who hung the picture of a ship under
full sail in her livingroom She bore seven sons Not one of them ever
saw the ocean until he was grown and yet all of them became sailors
This was not an accident In her age and loneliness she blamed God for
taking her children from her Yet she had made sailors of them all by
the selection of a single piece of furniture in her room Nature has a
way of starting her children on their journey through this world very
nearly equaleach a bundle of possibilities in the hands of a mother
A father may transmit physical disease if his body is unsound Such
marriages should be prohibited by law But ninetenths of the spiritual
traits out of which character is formed are the work of the mother A
criminal mother will bring into the world only criminals A criminal
male may be the father of a saint The responsibility of shaping the
destiny of the race rests with the mother

The Doctor sprang to his feet and paced the floor his arms gripped
behind his back in deep thought He paused before the enraptured
listener and hesitated to speak the thought in his mind

He lifted his hand suddenly his decision apparently made

It is of the utmost importance to the race that our mothers shall
be pure Better certainly if both father and mother are so It is
indispensable that the mother shall be On this elemental fact rests the
dual standard of sex morals On this fact rests the hope of a glorified
humanity through the development of an intelligent motherhood Stay here
with me until your child is born and Ill prove the truth of every word
Ive spoken

Oh if I only could

Why not

I couldnt impose such a burden on you she faltered

You would confer on me the highest honor if you will allow me to
direct you in this experiment

There was no mistaking his honesty and earnestness There was no
refusing the appeal

You really wish me to stay she asked

I beg of you to stay You will bring to me a new inspirationnew
faithnew courage to fight Will you

She extended her hand

Yes

And you will agree to follow my instructions

Absolutely

Good We begin from this moment I give you my first orders Forget
that James Anthony ever lived Forget the tragedy of Christmas Eve
You are going to be a mother All other events in life pale before this
fact God has conferred on you the highest honor He can give to
mortal Keep your soul serene your body strong You are to worry about
nothing

I must pay you for this extra expense I impose Doctor I have a
thousand dollars in bank in New York she interrupted

Certainly if you will be happier My home is now your sanitarium You
are my patient Your board will cost me about eight dollars a week All
right You can pay that if you wish

Take no thought now except on the business of being a mother I will
make myself your father your brother your guardian your physician
your friend and companion I will give you at once a course of reading
You are to think only beautiful thoughts see beautiful things dream
beautiful dreams hear beautiful music Im going to make you climb
these mountain peaks with me for the next three months and live among
the clouds Im going to refit your room with new furniture and pictures
and place in it a phonograph with the best music When you are strong
enough you can work for me three hours a day as my secretary You use
the typewriter

Im an expert

Good Im writing a book which Im going to call The Rulers of the
World It is a study of Motherhood I am one who believes that the
redemption of humanity awaits the realization by woman of her divine
call When woman knows that she is really a cocreator with God in the
reproduction of the race a new era will dawn for mankind You promise
me faithfully to obey my instructions

Faithfully

Youre a wonderful subject on which to make an experiment You are
youngin the first dawn of the glory of womanhood Your body is
beautiful your mind singularly pure and sweet You must give me at once
the full power of your will in its concentration on Truth and Beauty
The success or failure of this experiment will depend almost entirely on
your mentality and the use you make of it during these months in which
your babe is being formed Whatever the shape of the body there is one
eternal certaintyonly YOUR mind can reach the soul of this child
If the father were the veriest fiend who ever existed and should
concentrate his mind to the task not one thought from his darkened soul
could reach your babe YOUR mind will be the everbrooding enfolding
spirit forming and fashioning character

He paused and his deep brown eyes flashed with enthusiasm

Think of it You are now creating an immortal being whose word may bend
a million wills to his And you are doing this mighty work solely by
your mind The physical processes are simple and automatic

The first lesson you must learn and hold with deathless grip is that
thoughts are things A thought can kill the body A thought can heal the
body If I am successful as a physician it is because I use this power
with my patients With some I use drugs with others none With all
I use every ounce of mental power which God has given me You will
remember this

Yes

He walked to the shelves and drew down a volume of poetry

Read these poems until you are tired todaythen sleep Ill give you
a good novel tomorrow and when youve read it a volume of philosophy
When we climb the peaks Ill give you a study of these rocks that will
tell you the story of their birth their life and their coming death
Well learn something of the birds and flowers next spring Well dream
great dreams and think great thoughtsyou and Iin these wonderful
days and weeks and months which God shall give us together

She looked up at him through her tears

Oh Doctor you have not only saved a miserable life you have saved my
soul




CHAPTER XXVI A SOUL IS BORN

It was more than a month after the experiment began before the Doctor
ventured to hint of Jims survival He had waited patiently until
Marys strength had been fully restored and her mind filled with the new
enthusiasm for motherhood He could tell her now with little risk And
yet he ventured on the task with reluctance He found her seated at her
favorite window overlooking the deep blue valley of the Swannanoa a
volume of poetry in her lap

He touched her shoulder and she smiled in cheerful response

You are content he asked

A strange peace is slowly stealing into my heart she responded
reverently I shall learn to love life again when my baby comes to help
me

You remember your solemn promise

Have I not kept it she murmured

Faithfullyand I remind you of it that you may not forget today for a
moment that your work is too high and holy to allow a shadow to darken
your spirit even for an hour I have something to tell you that may
shock a little unless I warn you

She lifted her eyes with a quick look of uneasiness and studied his
immovable face

You couldnt guess he laughed

She shook her head in puzzled silence

Suppose I were to tell you he went on evenly that I found a spark
of life in your husbands body that morning and drew him back from the
grave

Her eyes closed and she stretched her hand toward the Doctor

He clasped the fingers firmly between both his palms held and stroked
them gently

You did save him she breathed

Yes

Thank God his poor old mother is not a murderer But he is dead to me
I shall never see him againnever

I thought you would feel that way the Doctor quietly replied

You wont let him come here she asked suddenly

He wont try unless you consent

Mary shuddered

You dont know him

The Doctor smiled

Im afraid you dont know him now my child

He has changed

The old old miracle over again He has been literally born againthis
time of the spirit

Its incredible

Its true Hes a new man I think his reformation is the real thing
Hes young Hes strong He has brains He has personality

Mary lifted her hand

All I ask of him is to keep out of my sight The world is big enough
for us both The past is now a nightmare If I live to be a hundred
years old with my dying breath I shall feel the grip of his fingers on
my throat

She paused and closed her eyes

Forget it Forget it the Doctor laughed We have more important
things to think of now

He wishes to see me

Begs every day that I ask you

And you have hesitated these long weeks

Your strength and peace of mind were of greater importance than his
happiness my dear Let him wait until you please to see him

Hell wait forever was the firm answer

Jim smiled grimly when his friend bore back the message

Ill never give up as long as theres breath in my body he cried
bringing his square jaws together with a snap

Thats the way to talk my boy the Doctor responded

Anyhow you believe in me Doc dont you

Yes

And youll help me a little on the way if it gets darkwont you

If I canyou may always depend on me

Jim clasped his outstretched hand gratefully

Well Im going to make good

There was something so genuine and manly in the tones of his voice he
compelled the Doctors respect A smaller man might have sneered The
healer of souls and bodies had come to recognize with unerring instinct
the true and false note in the human voice

His heart went out in a wave of sympathy for the lonely miserable young
animal who stood before him now trembling with the first sharp pains
of the immortal thing that had awaked within He slipped his arm about
Jims shoulders and whispered

Ill tell you something that may help you when the way gets darkthe
wife is going to bear you a child

No

Yes

God Thats great aint it

Jim choked into silence and looked up at the Doctor with dimmed eyes

Say Doc you hit me hard when you brought what she saidbut thats
good news Watch me work my hands to the boneyou know its my kid and
she cant keep me from workin for it if she tries now can she

No

Theres just one thing thatll hang over me like a black cloud he
mused sorrowfully

I know boyyour mothers darkened mind

Jim nodded

When I see that queer glitter in her eyes it goes through me like a
knife Will she ever get over it

We cant tell yet It takes time I believe she will

Youll do the best you can for her Doc he pleaded pathetically You
wont forget her a single day If you cant cure her nobody can

Ill do my level best boy

Jim pressed his hand again

Gee but youve been a friend to me I didnt know that there were such
men in the world as you

For six months the Doctor watched the transplanted child of the slums
grow into a sturdy manhood in his new environment He snapped at every
suggestion his friend gave and with quick wit improved on it He not
only discovered and developed a mica mine on his mothers farm he
invented new machinery for its working that doubled the market output
Within six weeks from the time he began his shipments the mine was
paying a steady profit of more than five hundred dollars a month He had
made just one trip to New York and secretly returned to the police every
stolen jewel and piece of plunder taken with a full confession of the
time and place of the crime He had shipped his tools and machinery from
the workshop on the east side before his sensational act and made good
his departure for the South

The tools and machinery he installed in a new workshop which he built
in the yard of Nances cabin Here he worked day and night at his
blacksmith forge making the iron hinges and irons shovels tongs fire
sets and iron work complete for a log bungalow of seven rooms which
he was building on the sunny slope of the mountain which overlooks the
valley toward Asheville

The Doctor had lent Jim the blueprints of his own home and he was
quietly duplicating it with loving care His wife might refuse to see
him but he could build a home for their boy For his sake she couldnt
refuse it

With childlike obedience Nance followed him every day and watched the
workmen rear the beautiful structure under Jims keen eyes and skillful
hands The mans devotion to his mother was pathetic Only the Doctor
knew the secret of his pitiful care and he kept his own counsel




CHAPTER XXVII THE BABY

The last roses of summer were bursting their topmost buds into full
bloom on the lawn of the Doctors bungalow The martins that built each
year in the little boxes he had set on poles around his garden were
circling and chattering far up in the sapphire skies of a late September
day Their leaders had sensed the coming frost and were drilling for
their long march across the world to their winter home The chestnut
burrs were bursting in the woods The silent sunwrapped Indian Summer
had begun Not a cloud flecked the skies

A quiet joy filled the soul of the woman who smiled and heard her
summons

You are not afraid the Doctor asked

She turned her grateful eyes to his

The peace of God fills the worldand I owe it all to you

Nonsense Your sturdy will and cultivated mind did the work I merely
made the suggestion

You are not going to give me an anesthetic are you she said evenly

Why did you ask that

Because I wish to feel and know the pain and glory of it all

You dont wish to take it

Not unless you say I should

What a wonderful patient you are child What a beautiful spirit He
looked at her intently Well Im older and wiser in experience than
you Im glad you added that clause unless you say I should Im going
to say it After all my talks to you on our return to the truths and
simplicity of Nature you are perhaps surprised You neednt be Im
going to put you into a gentle sleep Nature will then do her physical
work automatically I do this because our daughters are the inheritors
of the sins of their mothers for centuries The overrefinement of
nerves the hothouse methods of living and the maiming of their bodies
with the inventions of fashion have made the pains of this supreme hour
beyond endurance This should not be It will not be so when our race
has come into its own But it will take many generations and perhaps
many centuries before we reach the ideal No physician who has a soul
could permit a woman of your physique your culture and refinement to
walk barefoot and blindfolded into such a hell of physical torture I
will not permit it

He walked quietly into his laboratory prepared the sleeping powders and
gave them to her

Six hours later she opened her eyes with eager wonder Aunt Abbie was
busy over a bundle of fluffy clothes The Doctor was standing with his
arms folded behind his back his fine cleanshaven face in profile
looking thoughtfully over the sunlit valley There was just one moment
of agonized fear If they had failed If her child were hideousor
deformed Her lips moved in silent prayer

Doctor she whispered

In a moment he was bending over her a look of exaltation in his brown
eyes

Tell me quick

A wonderful boy little mother The most beautiful babe I have ever
seen He didnt even cryjust opened his big wide eyes and grunted
contentedly

Give him to me

Aunt Abbie laid the warm bundle in her arms and she pressed it gently
until the sweet red flesh touched her own She lay still for a moment
a smile on her lips

Lift him and let me look

What a funny little pug nose she laughed

Yesexactly like his mothers the Doctor replied

She gazed with breathless reverence

He is beautiful isnt he she sighed

And you have observed the chin and mouth

Exactly like yours Its wonderful




CHAPTER XXVIII WHAT IS LOVE

Eighteen months swiftly passed with the little mother and her boy still
in Dr Mulfords sanitarium She had allowed herself to be persuaded
that he had the right to be her guide and helper in the first years
training of the child

The boy had steadily grown in strength and beauty of body and mind The
Doctor persuaded her to spend one more winter basking in his sunparlor
and finishing the final chapters of his book Her mind was singularly
clever and helpful in the interpretation of the experiences and emotions
of motherhood

She had stubbornly resisted every suggestion to see her husband or allow
him to see the child The Doctor had managed twice to give Jim an hour
with the baby while she had gone to Asheville on shopping trips He was
rewarded for his trouble in the devotion with which the young father
worshiped his son The Doctor watched the slumbering fires kindle in
the mans deep blue eyes with increasing wonder at the strength and
tenderness of his newfound soul

Jim had completed the furnishing of the bungalow with the advice and
guidance of his friend and every room stood ready and waiting for its
mistress He had insisted on making every piece of furniture for Marys
room and the nursery adjoining The Doctor was amazed at the mechanical
genius he displayed in its construction He had taken a months
instruction at a cabinet makers in Asheville and the bed bureau
tables and chairs which he had turned out were astonishingly beautiful
Their lines were copied from old models and each piece was a work of
art The iron work was even more tastefully and beautifully wrought He
had toiled day and night with an enthusiasm and patience that gave the
physician a new revelation in the possibility of the development of
human character

His friend came at last with a cheering message He began smilingly

Im going to make the big fight today boy to get her to see you

You think she will

Theres a good chance Her savings have all been used up from her bank
account in New York She is determined to go to her father in Kentucky
Ill have a talk with her bring her over to the bungalow show her
through it on the pretext of its model construction and then you can
tell her that you built it with your own hands for her and the baby You
might be loafing around the place about that time

Jims hand was suddenly lifted

I got ye Doc I got ye Ill be thereall day

Dont let her see you until I give the signal

Cautions my name

Well see what happens

Jim pressed close

Say Doc if you know how to pray I wish youd send up a little word
for me while youre talkin to her Could ye now

Ill do my best for you boyand I think youve got a chance Shes
been watching the blue eyes of that baby lately with a rather curious
look of unrest

Theyre just like mine aint they Jim broke in with pride

Time has softened the old hurt the Doctor went on The boy may win
for you

The square jaw came together with a smash

GeeI hope so Ill wait there all day for you and Im goin to try my
own hand at a little prayer or two on the side while Im waiting Maybe
Godll think Hes hit me hard enough by this time to give me another
trial

With a friendly wave of his hand the Doctor hurried home

He found Mary seated under the rose trellis beside the drive watching
for his coming The day was still and warm for the end of April Birds
were singing and chattering in every branch and tree A quail on the top
fencerail of the wheat field called loudly to his mate

The boy was screaming his joy over a new wagon to which Aunt Abbie had
hitched his goat He drove by in style lifted his chubby hand to his
mother and shouted

Doodby Docter

The Doctor waved a smiling answer and lapsed into a long silence

He waked at last from his absorption to notice that Mary was
daydreaming The fair brow was drawn into deep lines of brooding

Why shadows in your eyes a day like this little mother he asked
softly

Just thinking

About a past that you should forget

Yes and no she answered thoughtfully I was just thinking in this
flood of spring sunlight of the mystery of my love for such a man as the
one I married How could it have been possible to really love him

You are sure that you loved him

Sure

How did you know

By all the signs I trembled at his footstep The touch of his hand
the sound of his voice thrilled me I was drawn by a power that was
resistless I was mad with happiness those wonderful days that preceded
our marriage I was madder still during our honeymoonuntil the
shadows began to fall that fatal Christmas Eve She paused and her lips
trembled Oh Doctor what is love

The drooping shoulders of the man bent lower He picked up a pebble from
the ground and flicked it carelessly across the drive lifted his head
at last and asked earnestly

Shall I tell you the truth

Yesyour own particular brand pleasethe truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth

Ill try he began soberly If I were a poet naturally I would use
different language As Im only a prosaic doctor and physiologist I may
shock your ideals a little

No matter she interrupted They couldnt well get a harder jolt than
they have had already

He nodded and went on

There are two elemental human forces that maintain lifehunger
and love They are both utterly simple otherwise they could not be
universal Hunger compels the race to live Love compels it to reproduce
itself There has never been anything mysterious about either of
these forces and there never will beexcept in the imagination of
sentimentalists

Nature begins with hunger For about thirteen years she first applies
this force to the development of the body before she begins to lay the
foundation of the second Until this second development is complete the
passion known as love cannot be experienced

What is this second development Very simple again At the base of the
brain of every child there is a vacant space during the first twelve or
fifteen years During the age of twelve to fourteen in girls thirteen
to fifteen in boys this vacant space is slowly filled by a new lobe
of the brain and with its growth comes the consciousness of sex and the
development of sex powers

This new nerve center becomes on maturity a powerful physical magnet
The moment this magnet comes into contact with an organization which
answers its needs as certain kinds of food answer the needs of hunger
violent desire is excited If both these magnets should be equally
powerful the disturbance to both will be great The longer the personal
association is continued the more violent becomes this disturbance
until in highly sensitive natures it develops into an obsession which
obscures reason and crushes the will

The meaning of this impulse is again very simplethe unconscious
desire of the male to be a father of the female to become a mother

And there is but one man on earth who could thus affect me Mary asked
excitedly

Rubbish There are thousands

Thousands

Literally thousands The reason you never happen to meet them is purely
an accident of our poor social organization Every woman has thousands
of true physical mates if she could only meet them Every man has
thousands of true physical mates if he could only meet them And in
every such meeting if mind and body are in normal condition the same
violent disturbance would resultwhether married or single free or
bound

Marriage therefore is not based merely on the passion of love It is
a crime for any man or woman to marry without love It is the sheerest
insanity to believe that this passion within itself is sufficient to
justify marriage All who marry should love Many love who should not
marry

The institution of marriage is the great SOCIAL ordinance of the race
Its sanctity and perpetuity are not based on the violence of the passion
of love but something else

He paused and listened to the call of the quail again from the field

You hear that bob white calling his mate

Yesand shes answering him now very softly I can hear them both

They have mated this spring to build a home and rear a brood of young
Within six months their babies will all be full grown and next spring
a new alignment of lovers will be made Their marriage lasts during the
period of infancy of their offspring This is Natures law

It happens in the case of man that the period of infancy of a human
being is about twentyfour years This is the most wonderful fact in
nature It means that the capacity of man for the improvement of his
breed is practically limitless A quail has a few months in which to
rear her young God gives to woman a quarter of a century in which to
mold her immortal offspring Because the period of infancy of one child
covers the entire period of motherhood capacity marriage binds for
life and the sanctity of marriage rests squarely on this law of
Nature

He paused again and looked over the sunlit valley

I wish our boys and girls could all know these simple truths of their
being It would save much unhappiness and many tragic blunders

You were swept completely off your feet by the rush of the first
emotion caused by meeting a man who was your physical mate You imagined
this emotion to be a mysterious revelation which can come but once
Your imagination in its excited condition of course gave to your
firstfound mate all sorts of divine attributes which he did not
possess You were in love with a puppet of your own creation and
hypnotized yourself into the delusion that James Anthony was your one
and only mate your knight your hero

In a very important sense this was true Your intuitions could not make
a mistake on so vital an issue But you immediately rushed into marriage
and your union has been perfected by the birth of a child Whether you
are happy or unhappy in marriage does not depend on the reality of love
Happiness in marriage is based on something else

On what

The joy and peace that comes from oneness of spirit tastes culture
and character I know this from the deepest experiences of life and the
widest observation

You have loved she asked softly

Twice

A silence fell between them

Shall I tell you little mother he finally asked quietly

Please

He seated himself and looked into the skies beyond the peaks across the
valley

Ten years ago I met my first mate The meeting was fortunate for both
She was a woman of gentle birth of beautiful spirit Our courtship was
ideal We thought alike we felt alike she loved my profession evenan
unusual trait in a woman She thought it so noble in its aims that
the petty jealousy that sometimes wrecks a doctors life was to her an
unthinkable crime The first year was the nearest to heaven that I had
ever gotten down here

And then little mother by one of those inexplicable mysteries of
nature she died when our baby was born For a while the light of the
world went out I quit New York gave up my profession and came here
just to lie in the sun on this mountainside and try to pull myself
together I didnt think life could ever be worth living again But
it was I found about me so much of human needso much ignorance and
helplessnessso much to pity and love I forgot the ache in my own
heart in bringing joy to others

I had money enough I gave up the ambitions of greed and strife and set
my soul to higher tasks For nine years Ive devoted my leisure hours
to the study of Motherhood as the hope of a nobler humanity But for the
great personal sorrow that came to me in the death of my wife and baby I
should never have realized the truths I now see so clearly

And then the other woman suddenly came into my life I never expected
to love againnot because I thought it impossible but because I
thought it improbable in my little world here that I could ever again
meet a woman I would ask to be my wife But she dropped one day out of
the sky

He paused and took a deep breath

I recognized her instantly as my mate gentle and pure and capable
of infinite joy or infinite pain She did not realize the secret of my
interest in her I didnt expect it I knew that under the conditions
she could not But I waited

He paused and searched for Marys eyes

And you married her she asked in even tones

I have never allowed her to know that I love her

Why

She was married

Mary threw him a startled look and he went on evenly

I could have used my power over mind and body to separate her from
her husband I confess that I was tempted But there was a child Their
union had been sealed with the strongest tie that can bind two human
beings I have never allowed her to realize that she might love me Had
I chosen to break the silence between us I could have revealed this to
her taken her and torn her from the man to whom she had borne a babe
I had no right to commit that crime no matter how deep the love that
cried for its own Marriage is based on the period of infancy of the
child which spans the maternal life of woman God had joined these two
people together and no man had the right to put them asunder

And you gave her up

I had to little mother On the recognition of this eternal law the
whole structure of our civilization rests

Mary bent her gaze steadily on his face for a moment in silence

And you are telling me that I should be reconciled to the man who
choked me into insensibility

I am telling you that he is the father of your sonthat he has rights
which you cannot deny that when you gave yourself to him in the first
impulse of love a deed was done which Almighty God can never undo
Your tragic blunder was the rush into marriage with a man about whose
character you knew so little Its the timid shrinking homeloving
girl that makes this mistake You must face it now You are responsible
as deeply and truly as the man who married you That he happened at that
moment to be a brute and a criminal is no more his fault than yours It
was YOUR business to KNOW before you made him the father of your child

I tried to appeal to his better nature that awful night Mary
interrupted but he only laughed at me

You owe him another trial little motheryou owe it to his boy too

Mary shook her head bitterly

I cantI just cant

You wont see him once

She sprang to her feet trembling

Nono

I dont think its fair

Im afraid of him You cant understand his power over my will

Come come this is sheer cowardicegive the devil his dues Face him
and fight it out Tell him youre done forever with him and his life if
you willbut dont hedge and trim and run away like this Im ashamed
of you

I wont see himIve made up my mind

The Doctor threw up both hands

All right If you wont you wont Well let it go at that

He paused and changed his tones to friendly personal interest

And youre determined to leave me and take my kid away tomorrow

We must go Ive no money to pay my board I cant impose on you

Its going to be awfully lonely

He looked at her with a strange deep gaze lifted his stooping
shoulders with sudden resolution and changed his manner to light banter

I suppose I couldnt persuade you to give me that boy

She smiled tenderly

You know his father did leave his mark on him after all The eyes are
all his Of course I will admit that those drooping lids have often
been the mark of geniusperhaps a genius for evil in this case If you
dont want to take the risknows your chance I will

Mary shook her head in reproachful protest

Dont tease me dear doctor man Ive just this one day more with you
Im counting each precious hour

Forgive me he cried gayly I wont tease you any more Come well
run over now and see our neighbors new bungalow before you go You
admire this one and threaten to duplicate it He has built a better
one

I dont believe it

Youll go

If you wish it

Good Well take the boy too He can drive his new wagon the whole
way Its only half a mile




CHAPTER XXIX THE NEW MAN

The door of the bungalow stood wide open Mary paused in rapture over
the rich beds of wood violets that carpeted the spaces between the drive
and the log walls

Arent they beautiful she cried A perfect carpet of dazzling green
and purple

Come right in the Doctor urged from the steps My neighbors a
patient of mine He hasnt moved in yet but he told me always to make
myself at home

Mary lifted the boy from his wagon tied the goat and led the child
into the house The Doctor showed her through without comment None was
needed The womans keen eye saw at a glance the perfection of care with
which the master builder had wrought the slightest detail of every
room The floors were immaculate native hardwoodits grain brought out
through shining mirrors of clean varnish There was not one shoddy piece
of work from the kitchen sink to the big open fireplace in the spacious
hall and livingroom

Its exquisite she exclaimed at last It seems all
handmadedoesnt it

It is too The owner literally built it with his own handsa work of
love

For himself Mary asked with a smile

For the woman he loves of course My neighbors a sort of crank and
insisted on expressing himself in this way Come I want you to see two
rooms upstairs

He led her into the room Jim had built for his wife

Observe this furniture if you please

Dont tell me that he built that too she laughed

Thats exactly what Im going to tell you

Impossible she protested Why the line and finish would do credit
to the finest artisan in America

So I say Look at the perfect polish of that table Its like the
finish of a rosewood piano He touched the smooth surface

Of course youre joking Mary answered No amateur could have done
such work

So Id have said if I had not seen him do it

What on earth possessed him to undertake such a task

The love of a beautiful womanwhat else

He learned a tradejust to furnish this room with his own hand

Yes

His love must be the real thing she mused

Thats what Ive said Look at this iron work toothe stately
andirons in that big fireplace the shovel the tongs and the massive
strophinges on the doors

He did that too she asked in amazement

Every piece of iron on the place he beat out with his own hand at his
forge

And all for the love of a woman The age of romance hasnt passed after
all has it

No

Mary paused before the window looking south

What a glorious view she cried Its even grander than yours
Doctor

Yes I claim some of the credit though for that I helped him lay out
the grounds

Who is this remarkable man she asked at last

A friend of mine Ill introduce him directly He should be here at any
moment now

Were intruding Mary whispered We must go I mustnt look any more
Ill be coveting my neighbors house

The doctor turned to the window and signaled to someone on the lawn as
Mary hurried down the stairs

She fairly ran into Jim who was being pulled into the house by the boy

Ook Mamma Ook I found a Daddy He says he be my Daddy if you let
him Please let him I want a Daddy an I like him Please

Jim blushed and trembled and lifted his eyes appealingly while Mary
stood white and still watching him in a sort of helpless terror

The child moved on to his wagon

Say little girl Jim began in low tones its been a thousand years
since I saw you Dont drive me awayjust give me one chance for Gods
sake and this babys that He sent us Ive gone straight Ive sent back
every dishonest dollar Im earning a clean living down here and a good
one Ive practiced for two years cutting out the slang too

He paused for breath and she turned her head away

Just listen a minute I know I was a beast that night Im not the same
now Ive been through the fires of hell and Ive come out a cleaner
man Let me show you how much I love you Lifes too short but just
give me a chance If I could undo that awful hour when I hurt you so
Id crawl round the world on my hands and kneesand Ill show you that
I mean it I built this house for you and the baby

Mary turned suddenly with wide dilated eyes

YouYOU built this house she gasped

Ive worked on it every hour day and night the past two years when
I wasnt earning a living in the mine I made every stick of that
furniture in the rooms up therefor you and my boy The house is
yourswhether you let me stay or not

II cant take it Jim she faltered

Youve got to girlie You cant throw a gift like this back in a
fellows faceit cost too much Your moneys all gone Youve got to
bring up that kid Hes mine too Im man enough to support my wife and
baby and Im going to do it I dont care what you say Youve got to
let me Im going to work for you live for you and die for youwhether
you stay with me or not Ive got the right to do that you know

She lifted her head and faced him squarely for the first time amazed at
the new dignity and strength of his quiet bearing

You HAVE changed Jim

Her eyes sought the depths of his soul in a moments silence and she
slowly extended her hand

Well try again

He bent and kissed the tips of her fingers reverently

They stood for a moment hand in hand and looked over the sunlit valley
of the Swannanoa shimmering in peace and beauty between its sheltering
walls of blue mountains The bees were humming spring music among the
flowers at their feet and the faint odor of fruit trees in blossom came
from the orchard Jim had planted two years before

Ill show you little girlIll show you he whispered tensely
