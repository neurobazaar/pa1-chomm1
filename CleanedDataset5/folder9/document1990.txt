THE BEDFORDROW CONSPIRACY




CHAPTER I


OF THE LOVES OF MR PERKINS AND MISS GORGON AND OF THE TWO GREAT
FACTIONS IN THE TOWN OF OLDBOROUGH

My dear John cried Lucy with a very wise look indeed it must and
shall be so As for Doughty Street with our means a house is out of
the question We must keep three servants and Aunt Biggs says the taxes
are oneandtwenty pounds a year

I have seen a sweet place at Chelsea remarked John Paradise Row
No 17gardengreenhousefifty pounds a yearomnibus to town within
a mile

What that I may be left alone all day and you spend a fortune in
driving backward and forward in those horrid breakneck cabs My darling
I should die theredie of fright I know I should Did you not say
yourself that the road was not as yet lighted and that the place
swarmed with publichouses and dreadful tipsy Irish bricklayers Would
you kill me John

My daarling said John with tremendous fondness clutching Miss
Lucy suddenly round the waist and rapping the hand of that young person
violently against his waistcoatMy daarling dont say such things
even in a joke If I objected to the chambers it is only because you
my love with your birth and connections ought to have a house of your
own The chambers are quite large enough and certainly quite good enough
for me And so after some more sweet parley on the part of these
young people it was agreed that they should take up their abode
when married in a part of the House number One hundred and something
Bedford Row

It will be necessary to explain to the reader that John was no other
than John Perkins Esquire of the Middle Temple barristeratlaw and
that Miss Lucy was the daughter of the late Captain Gorgon and Marianne
Biggs his wife The Captain being of noble connections younger son of
a baronet cousin to Lord X and related to the Y family had
angered all his relatives by marrying a very silly pretty young woman
who kept a ladiesschool at Canterbury She had six hundred pounds
to her fortune which the Captain laid out in the purchase of a sweet
travellingcarriage and dressingcase for himself and going abroad with
his lady spent several years in the principal prisons of Europe in one
of which he died His wife and daughter were meantime supported by the
contributions of Mrs Jemima Biggs who still kept the ladiesschool

At last a dear old relativesuch a one as one reads of in
romancesdied and left seven thousand pounds apiece to the two sisters
whereupon the elder gave up schooling and retired to London and the
younger managed to live with some comfort and decency at Brussels
upon two hundred and ten pounds per annum Mrs Gorgon never touched
a shilling of her capital for the very good reason that it was placed
entirely out of her reach so that when she died her daughter found
herself in possession of a sum of money that is not always to be met
with in this world

Her aunt the baronets lady and her aunt the exschoolmistress both
wrote very pressing invitations to her and she resided with each for
six months after her arrival in England Now for a second time she had
come to Mrs Biggs Caroline Place Mecklenburgh Square It was under
the roof of that respectable old lady that John Perkins Esquire being
invited to take tea wooed and won Miss Gorgon

Having thus described the circumstances of Miss Gorgons life let us
pass for a moment from that young lady and lift up the veil of mystery
which envelopes the deeds and character of Perkins

Perkins too was an orphan and he and his Lucy of summer evenings
when Sol descending lingered fondly yet about the minarets of the
Foundling and gilded the grassplots of Mecklenburgh SquarePerkins
I say and Lucy would often sit together in the summerhouse of that
pleasureground and muse upon the strange coincidences of their life
Lucy was motherless and fatherless so too was Perkins If Perkins was
brotherless and sisterless was not Lucy likewise an only child Perkins
was twentythree his age and Lucys united amounted to fortysix and
it was to be remarked as a fact still more extraordinary that while
Lucys relatives were AUNTS Johns were UNCLES Mysterious spirit of
love let us treat thee with respect and whisper not too many of thy
secrets The fact is John and Lucy were a pair of fools as every young
couple OUGHT to be who have hearts that are worth a farthing and were
ready to find coincidences sympathies hidden gushes of feeling mystic
unions of the soul and what not in every single circumstance that
occurred from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof and in
the intervals Bedford Row where Perkins lived is not very far from
Mecklenburgh Square and John used to say that he felt a comfort that
his house and Lucys were served by the same muffinman

Further comment is needless A more honest simple clever
warmhearted soft whimsical romantical highspirited young fellow
than John Perkins did not exist When his father Doctor Perkins died
this his only son was placed under the care of John Perkins Esquire
of the house of Perkins Scully and Perkins those celebrated attorneys
in the trading town of Oldborough which the second partner William
Pitt Scully Esquire represented in Parliament and in London

All Johns fortune was the house in Bedford Row which at his fathers
death was let out into chambers and brought in a clear hundred a
year Under his uncles roof at Oldborough where he lived with thirteen
redhaired male and female cousins he was only charged fifty pounds
for board clothes and pocketmoney and the remainder of his rents
was carefully put by for him until his majority When he approached
that periodwhen he came to belong to two spoutingclubs at Oldborough
among the young merchants and lawyersclerksto blow the flute nicely
and play a good game at billiardsto have written one or two smart
things in the Oldborough Sentinelto be fond of smoking in which act
he was discovered by his fainting aunt at three oclock one morningin
one word when John Perkins arrived at manhood he discovered that he
was quite unfit to be an attorney that he detested all the ways of his
uncles stern dull vulgar regular redheaded family and he vowed
that he would go to London and make his fortune Thither he went his
aunt and cousins who were all serious vowing that he was a lost boy
and when his history opens John had been two years in the metropolis
inhabiting his own garrets and a very nice compact set of apartments
looking into the backgarden at this moment falling vacant the prudent
Lucy Gorgon had visited them and vowed that she and her John should
there commence housekeeping

All these explanations are tedious but necessary and furthermore it
must be said that as Johns uncles partner was the Liberal member for
Oldborough so Lucys uncle was its Ministerial representative

This gentleman the brother of the deceased Captain Gorgon lived at the
paternal mansion of Gorgon Castle and rejoiced in the name and title of
Sir George Grimsby Gorgon

He too like his younger brother had married a lady beneath his own
rank in life having espoused the daughter and heiress of Mr Hicks the
great brewer at Oldborough who held numerous mortgages on the Gorgon
property all of which he yielded up together with his daughter
Juliana to the care of the baronet

What Lady Gorgon was in character this history will show In person
if she may be compared to any vulgar animal one of her fathers heavy
healthy broadflanked Romannosed white drayhorses might to the
poetic mind appear to resemble her At twenty she was a splendid
creature and though not at her full growth yet remarkable for strength
and sinew at fortyfive she was as fine a woman as any in His Majestys
dominions Five feet seven in height thirteen stone her own teeth and
hair she looked as if she were the mother of a regiment of Grenadier
Guards She had three daughters of her own size and at length ten
years after the birth of the last of the young ladies a sonone
sonGeorge Augustus Frederick Grimsby Gorgon the godson of a royal
duke whose steady officer in waiting Sir George had been for many
years

It is needless to say after entering so largely into a description
of Lady Gorgon that her husband was a little shrivelled wizenfaced
creature eight inches shorter than her Ladyship This is the way of
the world as every single reader of this book must have remarked for
frolic love delights to join giants and pigmies of different sexes in
the bonds of matrimony When you saw her Ladyship in flamecoloured
satin and gorgeous toque and feathers entering the drawingroom as
footmen along the stairs shouted melodiously Sir George and Lady
Gorgon you beheld in her company a small withered old gentleman with
powder and large royal household buttons who tripped at her elbow as a
little weaklegged colt does at the side of a stout mare

The little General had been present at about a hundred and twenty
pitched battles on Hounslow Heath and Wormwood Scrubs but had never
drawn his sword against an enemy As might be expected therefore his
talk and tenue were outrageously military He had the whole Army List by
heartthat is as far as the fieldofficers all below them he scorned
A bugle at Gorgon Castle always sounded at breakfast and dinner a gun
announced sunset He clung to his pigtail for many years after the army
had forsaken that ornament and could never be brought to think much of
the Peninsular men for giving it up When he spoke of the Duke he used
to call him MY LORD WELLINGTONI RECOLLECT HIM AS CAPTAIN WELLESLEY
He swore fearfully in conversation was most regular at church and
regularly read to his family and domestics the morning and evening
prayer he bullied his daughters seemed to bully his wife who led him
whither she chose gave grand entertainments and never asked a friend
by chance had splendid liveries and starved his people and was
as dull stingy pompous insolent cringing illtempered a little
creature as ever was known

With such qualities you may fancy that he was generally admired in
society and by his country So he was and I never knew a man so
endowed whose way through life was not safewho had fewer pangs of
consciencemore positive enjoymentsmore respect shown to himmore
favours granted to him than such a one as my friend the General

Her Ladyship was just suited to him and they did in reality admire
each other hugely Previously to her marriage with the baronet many
lovepassages had passed between her and William Pitt Scully Esquire
the attorney and there was especially one story a propos of certain
syllabubs and SallyLunn cakes which seemed to show that matters had
gone very far Be this as it may no sooner did the General Major
Gorgon he was then cast an eye on her than Scullys five years fabric
of love was instantly dashed to the ground She cut him pitilessly
cut Sally Scully his sister her dearest friend and confidante and
bestowed her big person upon the little aidedecamp at the end of a
fortnights wooing In the course of time their mutual fathers died
the Gorgon estates were unencumbered patron of both the seats in the
borough of Oldborough and occupant of one Sir George Grimsby Gorgon
Baronet was a personage of no small importance

He was it scarcely need to be said a Tory and this was the reason
why William Pitt Scully Esquire of the firm of Perkins and Scully
deserted those principles in which he had been bred and christened
deserted that church which he had frequented for he could not bear to
see Sir George and my Lady flaunting in their grand pewdeserted I
say the church adopted the conventicle and became one of the most
zealous and eloquent supporters that Freedom has known in our time
Scully of the house of Scully and Perkins was a dangerous enemy In
five years from that marriage which snatched from the jilted solicitor
his hearts young affections Sir George Gorgon found that he must
actually spend seven hundred pounds to keep his two seats At the next
election a Liberal was set up against his man and actually ran
him hard and finally at the end of eighteen years the rejected
Scullythe mean attorneywas actually the FIRST Member for Oldborough
Sir George Grimsby Gorgon Baronet being only the second

The agony of that day cannot be imaginedthe dreadful curses of Sir
George who saw fifteen hundred a year robbed from under his very
nosethe religious resignation of my Ladythe hideous windowsmashing
that took place at the Gorgon Arms and the discomfiture of the pelted
Mayor and Corporation The very next Sunday Scully was reconciled to
the church or attended it in the morning and the meeting twice in the
afternoon and as Doctor Snorter uttered the prayer for the High Court
of Parliament his eye the eye of his whole partyturned towards Lady
Gorgon and Sir George in a most unholy triumph Sir George who always
stood during prayers like a military man fairly sank down among the
hassocks and Lady Gorgon was heard to sob as audibly as ever did little
beadlebelaboured urchin

Scully when at Oldborough came from that day forth to church What
said he was it to him were we not all brethren Old Perkins
however kept religiously to the Squaretoes congregation In fact to
tell the truth this subject had been debated between the partners
who saw the advantage of courting both the Establishment and the
Dissentersa manoeuvre which I need not say is repeated in almost
every country town in England where a solicitors house has this kind
of power and connection

Three months after this election came the races at Oldborough and the
raceball Gorgon was so infuriated by his defeat that he gave the
Gorgon cup and cover a matter of fifteen pounds Scully although
anxious as he wrote from town anxious beyond measure to preserve
the breed of horses for which our beloved country has ever been famous
could attend no such sports as these which but too often degenerated
into vice It was voted a shabby excuse Lady Gorgon was radiant in her
barouche and four and gladly became the patroness of the ball that was
to ensue and which all the gentry and townspeople Tory and Whig were
in the custom of attending The ball took place on the last day of the
races On that day the walls of the markethouse the principal public
buildings and the Gorgon Arms Hotel itself were plastered with the
following

Letter from our distinguished representative William P Scully
Esquire etc etc

 HOUSE OF COMMONS June 1 18

MY DEAR HEELTAPYou know my opinion about horseracing and though
I blame neither you nor any brother Englishman who enjoys that manly
sport you will I am sure appreciate the conscientious motives

representatives of Oldborough has no such scruples Sir George Gorgon is

ONE VITAL POINT I am glad to think that he is with you A gentleman a
soldier a man of property in the county how can he be better employed

happiness of all

 W PITT SCULLY

PSOf course this letter is STRICTLY PRIVATE Say that the venison
etc came from a WELLWISHER TO OLDBOROUGH

This amazing letter was published in defiance of Mr Scullys
injunctions by the enthusiastic Heeltap who said bluntly in a
preface that he saw no reason why Mr Scully should be ashamed of his
action and he for his part was glad to let all friends at Oldborough
know of it

The allusion about the Gorgon soup was killing thirteen paupers in
Oldborough had it was confidently asserted died of it Lady Gorgon
on the reading of this letter was struck completely dumb Sir George
Gorgon was wild Ten dozen of champagne was he obliged to send down to
the Gorgon Arms to be added to the festival He would have stayed
away if he could but he dared not

At nine oclock he in generals uniform his wife in blue satin and
diamonds his daughters in blue crape and white roses his niece Lucy
Gorgon in white muslin his son George Augustus Frederick Grimsby
Gorgon in a blue velvet jacket sugarloaf buttons and nankeens
entered the north door of the ballroom to much cheering and the sound
of God save the King

At that very same moment and from the south door issued William Pitt
Scully Esquire MP and his staff Mr Scully had a brandnew blue
coat and brass buttons buff waistcoat white kerseymere tights pumps
with large rosettes and pink silk stockings

This wool said he to a friend was grown on Oldborough sheep
this cloth was spun in Oldborough looms these buttons were cast in
an Oldborough manufactory these shoes were made by an Oldborough
tradesman this HEART first beat in Oldborough town and pray Heaven may
be buried there

Could anything resist a man like this John Perkins who had come down
as one of Scullys aidesdecamp in a fit of generous enthusiasm
leaped on a whisttable flung up a pockethandkerchief and
shriekedSCULLY FOR EVER

Heeltap who was generally drunk fairly burst into tears and the grave
tradesmen and Whig gentry who had dined with the Member at his inn and
accompanied him thence to the Gorgon Arms lifted their deep voices
and shouted Hear Good Bravo Noble Scully for ever God
bless him and Hurrah

The scene was tumultuously affecting and when young Perkins sprang down
from the table and came blushing up to the Member that gentleman said
Thank you Jack THANK you my boy THANK you in a way which made
Perkins think that his supreme cup of bliss was quaffed that he had but
to die for that life had no other such joy in store for him Scully
was Perkinss Napoleonhe yielded himself up to the attorney body and
soul

Whilst this scene was going on under one chandelier of the ballroom
beneath the other scarlet little General Gorgon sumptuous Lady Gorgon
the daughters and niece Gorgons were standing surrounded by their Tory
court who affected to sneer and titter at the Whig demonstrations which
were taking place

What a howwid thmell of whithkey lisped Cornet Fitch of the
Dragoons to Miss Lucy confidentially And thethe are what they call
Whigth are they He he

They are drunk me drunk by  said the General to the
Mayor

WHICH is Scully said Lady Gorgon lifting her glass gravely she was
at that very moment thinking of the syllabubs Is it that tipsy man in
the green coat or that vulgar creature in the blue one

Law my Lady said the Mayoress have you forgotten him Why thats
him in blue and buff

And a monthous fine man too said Cornet Fitch I wish we had him in
our twoopheth thix feet thwee if heth an inch aint he Genewal

No reply

And heavens Mamma shrieked the three Gorgons in a breath see one
creature is on the whisttable Oh the wretch

Im sure hes very goodlooking said Lucy simply

Lady Gorgon darted at her an angry look and was about to say something
very contemptuous when at that instant John Perkinss shout taking
effect Master George Augustus Frederick Grimsby Gorgon not knowing
better incontinently raised a small shout on his side

Hear good bravo exclaimed he Scully for ever Hurraaaay and
fell skipping about like the Whigs opposite

Silence you brute you groaned Lady Gorgon and seizing him by the
shirtfrill and coatcollar carried him away to his nurse who with
many other maids of the Whig and Tory parties stood giggling and
peeping at the landingplace

Fancy how all these small incidents augmented the heap of Lady Gorgons
anger and injuries She was a dull phlegmatic woman for the most part
and contented herself generally with merely despising her neighbours
but oh what a fine active hatred raged in her bosom for victorious
Scully At this moment Mr Perkins had finished shaking hands with his
NapoleonNapoleon seemed bent upon some tremendous enterprise He was
looking at Lady Gorgon very hard

Shes a fine woman said Scully thoughtfully he was still holding
the hand of Perkins And then after a pause Gad I think Ill try

Try what sir

Shes a DEUCED fine woman burst out again the tender solicitor I
WILL go Springer tell the fiddlers to strike up

Springer scuttled across the room and gave the leader of the band a
knowing nod Suddenly God save the King ceased and Sir Roger
de Coverley began The rival forces eyed each other Mr Scully
accompanied by his friend came forward looking very red and fumbling
two large kid gloves

HES GOING TO ASK ME TO DANCE hissed out Lady Gorgon with a dreadful
intuition and she drew back behind her lord

D it madam THEN DANCE with him said the General Dont you see
that the scoundrel is carrying it all his own way  him and 
him and  him All of which dashes the reader may fill up with
oaths of such strength as may be requisite

General cried Lady Gorgon but could say no more Scully was before
her

Madam exclaimed the Liberal Member for Oldborough in a moment
like thisI saythat isthat on the present occasionyour
Ladyshipunaccustomed as I ampooh pshaWILL your Ladyship give me
the distinguished honour and pleasure of going down the countrydance
with your Ladyship

An immense heave of her Ladyships ample chest was perceptible Yards of
blond lace which might be compared to a foam of the sea were agitated
at the same moment and by the same mighty emotion The river of
diamonds which flowed round her Ladyships neck seemed to swell and to
shine more than ever The tall plumes on her ambrosial head bowed down
beneath the storm In other words Lady Gorgon in a furious rage
which she was compelled to restrain trembled drew up and bowing
majestically said

Sir I shall have much pleasure With this she extended her hand
Scully trembling thrust forward one of his huge kidgloves and led
her to the head of the countrydance John Perkinswho I presume
had been drinking pretty freely so as to have forgotten his ordinary
bashfulnesslooked at the three Gorgons in blue then at the pretty
smiling one in white and stepping up to her without the smallest
hesitation asked her if she would dance with him

The young lady smilingly agreed The great example of Scully and Lady
Gorgon was followed by all dancing men and women Political enmities
were forgotten Whig voters invited Tory voters wives to the dance The
daughters of Reform accepted the hands of the sons of Conservatism The
reconciliation of the Romans and Sabines was not more touching than this
sweet fusion Whackwhack Springer clapped his hands and the fiddlers
adroitly obeying the cheerful signal began playing Sir Roger de
Coverley louder than ever

I do not know by what extraordinary charm nescio qua praeter solitum
etc but young Perkins who all his life had hated countrydances was
delighted with this one and skipped and laughed poussetting crossing
downthemiddling with his merry little partner till every one of the
bettermost sort of the thirtynine couples had dropped panting away and
till the youngest Miss Gorgon coming up to his partner said in a loud
hissing scornful whisper Lucy Mamma thinks you have danced quite
enough with thisthis person And Lucy blushing starting back and
looking at Perkins in a very melancholy way made him a little curtsey
and went off to the Gorgonian party with her cousin Perkins was too
frightened to lead her back to her placetoo frightened at first and
then too angry Person said he his soul swelled with a desperate
republicanism he went back to his patron more of a Radical than ever

He found that gentleman in the solitary tearoom pacing up and down
before the observant landlady and handmaidens of the Gorgon Arms
wiping his brows gnawing his fingershis ears looming over his stiff
white shirtcollar as red as fire Once more the great man seized John
Perkinss hand as the latter came up

D the aristocrats roared the exfollower of Squaretoes

And so say I but whats the matter sir

Whats the matterWhy that womanthat infernal haughty
straitlaced coldblooded brewers daughter I loved that woman sirI
KISSED that woman sir twenty years ago we were all but engaged sir
weve walked for hours and hours sirus and the governessIve got
a lock of her hair sir among my papers now and tonight would you
believe itas soon as she got to the bottom of the set away she
wentnot one word would she speak to me all the way down and when I
wanted to lead her to her place and asked her if she would have a glass
of negus Sir says she I have done my duty I bear no malice but
I consider you a traitor to Sir George Gorgons familya traitor and
an upstart I consider your speaking to me as a piece of insolent
vulgarity and beg you will leave me to myself Theres her speech
sir Twenty people heard it and all of her Tory set too Ill tell you
what Jack at the next election Ill put YOU up Oh that woman that
womanand to think that I love her still Here Mr Scully paused
and fiercely consoled himself by swallowing three cups of Mrs Rincers
green tea

The fact is that Lady Gorgons passion had completely got the better of
her reason Her Ladyship was naturally cold and artificially extremely
squeamish and when this great redfaced enemy of hers looked tenderly
at her through his red little eyes and squeezed her hand and attempted
to renew old acquaintance she felt such an intolerable disgust at his
triumph at his familiarity and at the remembrance of her own former
liking for him that she gave utterance to the speech above correctly
reported The Tories were delighted with her spirit and Cornet Fitch
with much glee told the story to the General but that officer who was
at whist with some of his friends flung down his cards and coming up
to his lady said briefly

Madam you are a fool

I will NOT stay here to be bearded by that disgusting manMr Fitch
call my peopleHenrietta bring Miss Lucy from that linendraper with
whom she is dancing I will not stay General once for all

Henrietta ranshe hated her cousin Cornet Fitch was departing Stop
Fitch said Sir George seizing him by the arm You are a fool Lady
Gorgon said he and I repeat ita  fool This fellow Scully
is carrying all before him he has talked with everybody laughed with
everybodyand you with your infernal airsa brewers daughter by
 must sit like a queen and not speak to a soul Youve lost me one
seat of my borough with your infernal pridefifteen hundred a year
by Joveand you think you will bully me out of another No madam you
SHALL stay and stay supper tooand the girls shall dance with every
cursed chimneysweep and butcher in the room they shallconfound me

Her Ladyship saw that it was necessary to submit and Mr Springer the
master of the ceremonies was called and requested to point out
some eligible partners for the young ladies One went off with a
Whig auctioneer another figured in a quadrille with a very Liberal
apothecary and the third Miss Henrietta remained

Hallo you sir roared the little General to John Perkins who was
passing by John turned round and faced him

You were dancing with my niece just nowshow us your skill now and
dance with one of my daughters Stand up Miss Henrietta GorgonMr
Whatsyourname

My name said John with marked and majestic emphasis is PERKINS
And he looked towards Lucy who dared not look again

Miss GorgonMr Perkins There now go and dance

Mr Perkins regrets madam said John making a bow to Miss Henrietta
that he is not able to dance this evening I am this moment obliged to
look to the supper but you will find no doubt some other PERSON who
will have much pleasure

Go to  sir screamed the General starting up and shaking his
cane

Calm yourself dearest George said Lady Gorgon clinging fondly to
him Fitch twiddled his moustaches Miss Henrietta Gorgon stared
with open mouth The silks of the surrounding dowagers rustledthe
countenances of all looked grave

I will follow you sir wherever you please and you may hear of me
whenever you like said Mr Perkins bowing and retiring He heard
little Lucy sobbing in a corner He was lost at oncelost in love he
felt as if he could combat fifty generals he never was so happy in his
life

The supper came but as that meal cost five shillings a head General
Gorgon dismissed the four spinsters of his family homewards in the
carriage and so saved himself a pound This added to Jack Perkinss
wrath he had hoped to have seen Miss Lucy once more He was a steward
and in the Generals teeth would have done his duty He was thinking
how he would have helped her to the most delicate chickenwings and
blancmanges how he WOULD have made her take champagne Under the noses
of indignant aunt and uncle what glorious fun it would have been

Out of place as Mr Scullys present was and though Lady Gorgon and her
party sneered at the vulgar notion of venison and turtle for supper
all the world at Oldborough ate very greedily of those two substantial
dishes and the Mayors wife became from that day forth a mortal
enemy of the Gorgons for sitting near her Ladyship who refused the
proffered soup and meat the Mayoress thought herself obliged to follow
this disagreeable example She sent away the plate of turtle with a
sigh saying however to the baronets lady I thought mem that the
LORD MAYOR OF LONDON always had turtle to his supper

And what if he didnt Biddy said his Honour the Mayor a good
things a good thing and here goes wherewith he plunged his spoon
into the savoury mess The Mayoress as we have said dared not but she
hated Lady Gorgon and remembered it at the next election

The pride in fact and insolence of the Gorgon party rendered every
person in the room hostile to them so soon as gorged with meat they
began to find that courage which Britons invariably derive from their
victuals The show of the Gorgon plate seemed to offend the people The
Gorgon champagne was a long time too in making its appearance Arrive
however it did The people were waiting for it the young ladies not
accustomed to that drink declined pledging their admirers until it
was produced the men too despised the bucellas and sherry and were
looking continually towards the door At last Mr Rincer the landlord
Mr Hock Sir Georges butler and sundry others entered the room Bang
went the corksfizz the foamy liquor sparkled into all sorts of glasses
that were held out for its reception Mr Hock helped Sir George and his
party who drank with great gusto the wine which was administered to
the persons immediately around Mr Scully was likewise pronounced to
be good But Mr Perkins who had taken his seat among the humbler
individuals and in the very middle of the table observed that all
these persons after drinking made to each other very wry and ominous
faces and whispered much He tasted his wine it was a villanous
compound of sugar vitriol sodawater and green gooseberries At
this moment a great clatter of forks was made by the presidents and
vicepresidents party Silence for a toasttwas silence all

Landlord said Mr Perkins starting up the rogue where did his
impudence come from have you any champagne of YOUR OWN

Silence down roared the Tories the ladies looking aghast Silence
sit down you shrieked the wellknown voice of the General

I beg your pardon General said young John Perkins but where COULD
you have bought this champagne My worthy friend I know is going to
propose the ladies let us at any rate drink such a toast in good wine
Hear hear Drink her Ladyships health in THIS stuff I declare to
goodness I would sooner drink it in beer

No pen can describe the uproar which arose the anguish of the
Gorgonitesthe shrieks jeers cheers ironic cries of Swipes etc
which proceeded from the less genteel but more enthusiastic Scullyites

This vulgarity is too much said Lady Gorgon rising and Mrs
Mayoress and the ladies of the party did so too

The General two squires the clergyman the Gorgon apothecary and
attorney with their respective ladies followed her they were plainly
beaten from the field Such of the Tories as dared remained and in
inglorious compromise shared the jovial Whig feast

Gentlemen and ladies hiccupped Mr Heeltap Ill give you a toast
Champagne to our realhicfriends no Real champagne to our
friends andhicpooh Champagne to our friends and real pain to
our enemieshuzzay

The Scully faction on this day bore the victory away and if the polite
reader has been shocked by certain vulgarities on the part of Mr
Scully and his friends he must remember imprimis that Oldborough was
an inconsiderable placethat the inhabitants thereof were chiefly
tradespeople not of refined habitsthat Mr Scully himself had only
for three months mingled among the aristocracythat his young friend
Perkins was violently angryand finally and to conclude that the
proud vulgarity of the great Sir George Gorgon and his family was
infinitely more odious and contemptible than the mean vulgarity of the
Scullyites and their leader

Immediately after this event Mr Scully and his young friend Perkins
returned to town the latter to his garrets in Bedford Rowthe former
to his apartments on the first floor of the same house He lived here to
superintend his legal business his London agents Messrs Higgs Biggs
and Blatherwick occupying the ground floor the junior partner Mr
Gustavus Blatherwick the second flat of the house Scully made no
secret of his profession or residence he was an attorney and proud of
it he was the grandson of a labourer and thanked God for it he had
made his fortune by his own honest labour and why should he be ashamed
of it

And now having explained at full length who the several heroes and
heroines of this history were and how they conducted themselves in the
country let us describe their behaviour in London and the great events
which occurred there

You must know that Mr Perkins bore away the tenderest recollections
of the young lady with whom he had danced at the Oldborough ball and
having taken particular care to find out where she dwelt when in the
metropolis managed soon to become acquainted with Aunt Biggs and made
himself so amiable to that lady that she begged he would pass all his
disengaged evenings at her lodgings in Caroline Place Mrs Biggs was
perfectly aware that the young gentleman did not come for her bohea
and muffins so much as for the sweeter conversation of her niece Miss
Gorgon but seeing that these two young people were of an age when ideas
of love and marriage will spring up do what you will seeing that her
niece had a fortune and Mr Perkins had the prospect of a place and
was moreover a very amiable and welldisposed young fellow she thought
her niece could not do better than marry him and Miss Gorgon thought
so too Now the public will be able to understand the meaning of that
important conversation which is recorded at the very commencement of
this history

Lady Gorgon and her family were likewise in town but when in the
metropolis they never took notice of their relative Miss Lucy the
idea of acknowledging an exschoolmistress living in Mecklenburgh Square
being much too preposterous for a person of my Lady Gorgons breeding
and fashion She did not therefore know of the progress which sly
Perkins was making all this while for Lucy Gorgon did not think it was
at all necessary to inform her Ladyship how deeply she was smitten
by the wicked young gentleman who had made all the disturbance at the
Oldborough ball

The intimacy of these young persons had in fact become so close that
on a certain sunshiny Sunday in December after having accompanied Aunt
Biggs to church they had pursued their walk as far as that rendezvous
of lovers the Regents Park and were talking of their coming marriage
with much confidential tenderness before the bears in the Zoological
Gardens

Miss Lucy was ever and anon feeding those interesting animals with buns
to perform which act of charity she had clambered up on the parapet
which surrounds their den Mr Perkins was below and Miss Lucy having
distributed her buns was on the point of followingbut whether from
timidity or whether from a desire to do young Perkins an essential
service I know not however she found herself quite unwilling to jump
down unaided

My dearest John said she I never can jump that

Whereupon John stepped up put one hand round Lucys waist and as one
of hers gently fell upon his shoulder Mr Perkins took the other and
said

Now jump

Hoop jump she did and so excessively active and clever was Mr John
Perkins that he jumped Miss Lucy plump into the middle of a group
formed of

Lady Gorgon

The Misses Gorgon

Master George Augustus Frederick Grimsby Gorgon

And a footman poodle and French governess who had all been for two or
three minutes listening to the billings and cooings of these imprudent
young lovers



CHAPTER II


SHOWS HOW THE PLOT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN OR ABOUT BEDFORD ROW

Miss Lucy

Upon my word

Im hanged if it arent Lucy How do Lucy uttered Lady the Misses
and Master Gorgon in a breath

Lucy came forward bending down her ambrosial curls and blushing as a
modest young woman should for in truth the scrape was very awkward
And as for John Perkins he made a start and then a step forwards and
then two backwards and then began laying hands upon his black satin
stockin short the sun did not shine at that moment upon a man who
looked so exquisitely foolish

Miss Lucy Gorgon is your auntis Mrs Briggs here said Lady Gorgon
drawing herself up with much state

Mrs Biggs Aunt said Lucy demurely

Biggs or Briggs madam it is not of the slightest consequence
I presume that persons in my rank of life are not expected to know
everybodys name in Magdeburg Square Lady Gorgon had a house in Baker
Street and a dismal house it was NOT here continued she rightly
interpreting Lucys silence NOT hereand may I ask how long is it
that young ladies have been allowed to walk abroad without chaperons
and toto take a part in such scenes as that which we have just seen
acted

To this questionand indeed it was rather difficult to answerMiss
Gorgon had no reply There were the six grey eyes of her cousins
glowering at her there was George Augustus Frederick examining her with
an air of extreme wonder Mademoiselle the governess turning her looks
demurely away and awful Lady Gorgon glancing fiercely at her in front
Not mentioning the footman and poodle what could a poor modest timid
girl plead before such an inquisition especially when she was clearly
guilty Add to this that as Lady Gorgon that majestic woman always
remarkable for her size and insolence of demeanour had planted herself
in the middle of the path and spoke at the extreme pitch of her voice
many persons walking in the neighbourhood had heard her Ladyships
speech and stopped and seemed disposed to await the rejoinder

For Heavens sake Aunt dont draw a crowd around us said Lucy who
indeed was glad of the only escape that lay in her power I will
tell you of theof the circumstances ofof my engagement with this
gentlemanwith Mr Perkins added she in a softer toneso soft that
the ERKINS was quite inaudible

A Mr What An engagement without consulting your guardians screamed
her Ladyship This must be looked to Jerningham call round my
carriage Mademoiselle you will have the goodness to walk home with
Master Gorgon and carry him if you please where there is wet and
girls as the day is fine you will do likewise Jerningham you will
attend the young ladies Miss Gorgon I will thank you to follow me
immediately And so saying and looking at the crowd with ineffable
scorn and at Mr Perkins not at all the lady bustled away forwards
the files of Gorgon daughters and governess closing round and enveloping
poor Lucy who found herself carried forward against her will and in a
minute seated in her aunts coach along with that tremendous person

Her case was bad enough but what was it to Perkinss Fancy his blank
surprise and rage at having his love thus suddenly ravished from
him and his delicious teteatete interrupted He managed in an
inconceivably short space of time to conjure up halfamillion
obstacles to his union What should he do he would rush on to Baker
Street and wait there until his Lucy left Lady Gorgons house

He could find no vehicle in the Regents Park and was in consequence
obliged to make his journey on foot Of course he nearly killed himself
with running and ran so quick that he was just in time to see the two
ladies step out of Lady Gorgons carriage at her own house and to hear
Jerninghams fellowfootman roar to the Gorgonian coachman Halfpast
seven at which hour we are to this day convinced that Lady Gorgon
was going out to dine Mr Jerninghams associate having banged to the
door with an insolent look towards Perkins who was prying in with the
most suspicious and indecent curiosity retired exclaiming That chap
has a hi to our greatcoats I reckon and left John Perkins to pace
the street and be miserable

John Perkins then walked resolutely up and down dismal Baker Street
determined on an eclaircissement He was for some time occupied in
thinking how it was that the Gorgons were not at church they who made
such a parade of piety and John Perkins smiled as he passed the chapel
and saw that two CHARITY SERMONS were to be preached that dayand
therefore it was that General Gorgon read prayers to his family at home
in the morning

Perkins at last saw that little General in blue frockcoat and
spotless buff gloves saunter scowling home and half an hour before his
arrival had witnessed the entrance of Jerningham and the three gaunt
Miss Gorgons poodle sonandheir and French governess protected by
him into Sir Georges mansion

Can she be going to stay all night mused poor John after being on
the watch for three hours when presently to his inexpressible delight
he saw a very dirty hackneycoach clatter up to the Gorgon door out of
which first issued the ruby plush breeches and stalwart calves of Mr
Jerningham these were followed by his body and then the gentleman
ringing modestly was admitted

Again the door opened a lady came out nor was she followed by the
footman who crossed his legs at the doorpost and allowed her to mount
the jingling vehicle as best she might Mr Jerningham had witnessed the
scene in the Park Gardens had listened to the altercation through the
library keyhole and had been mighty sulky at being ordered to call a
coach for this young woman He did not therefore deign to assist her to
mount

But there was ONE who did Perkins was by the side of his Lucy he
had seen her start back and cry La Johnhad felt her squeeze his
armhad mounted with her into the coach and then shouted with a voice
of thunder to the coachman Caroline Place Mecklenburgh Square

But Mr Jerningham would have been much more surprised and puzzled if
he had waited one minute longer and seen this Mr Perkins who had
so gallantly escaladed the hackneycoach step out of it with the most
mortified miserable chapfallen countenance possible

The fact is he had found poor Lucy sobbing fit to break her heart and
instead of consoling her as he expected he only seemed to irritate her
further for she said Mr PerkinsI begI insist that you leave the
carriage And when Perkins made some movement which not being in
the vehicle at the time we have never been able to comprehend she
suddenly sprang from the backseat and began pulling at a large piece
of cord which communicated with the wrist of the gentleman driving and
screaming to him at the top of her voice bade him immediately stop

This Mr Coachman did with a curious puzzled grinning air

Perkins descended and on being asked Vere ham I to drive the young
oman sir I am sorry to say muttered something like an oath and
uttered the abovementioned words Caroline Place Mecklenburgh
Square in a tone which I should be inclined to describe as both dogged
and sheepishvery different from that cheery voice which he had used
when he first gave the order

Poor Lucy in the course of those fatal three hours which had passed
while Mr Perkins was pacing up and down Baker Street had received a
lecture which lasted exactly one hundred and eighty minutesfrom her
aunt first then from her uncle whom we have seen marching homewards
and often from both together

Sir George Gorgon and his lady poured out such a flood of advice and
abuse against the poor girl that she came away from the interview quite
timid and cowering and when she saw John Perkins the sly rogue how
well he thought he had managed the trick she shrank from him as if
he had been a demon of wickedness ordered him out of the carriage and
went home by herself convinced that she had committed some tremendous
sin

While then her coach jingled away to Caroline Place Perkins
once more alone bent his steps in the same direction A desperate
heartstricken man he passed by the beloveds door saw lights in the
front drawingroom felt probably that she was there but he could not
go in Moodily he paced down Doughty Street and turning abruptly
into Bedford Row rushed into his own chambers where Mrs Snooks the
laundress had prepared his humble Sabbath meal

A cheerful fire blazed in his garret and Mrs Snooks had prepared for
him the favourite bladebone he loved blest fourdays dinner for
a bachelorroast cold hashed grilled bladebone the fourth being
better than the first but although he usually did rejoice in this
mealordinarily indeed grumbling that there was not enough to satisfy
himhe on this occasion after two mouthfuls flung down his knife and
fork and buried his two claws in his hair

Snooks said he at last very moodily remove this d mutton give
me my writing things and some hot brandyandwater

This was done without much alarm for you must know that Perkins used to
dabble in poetry and ordinarily prepare himself for composition by this
kind of stimulus

He wrote hastily a few lines

Snooks put on your bonnet said he and carry thisYOU KNOW WHERE
he added in a hollow heartbreaking tone of voice that affected poor
Snooks almost to tears She went however with the note which was to
this purpose

Lucy Lucy my souls lovewhat what has happened I am writing
thisa gulp of brandyandwaterin a state bordering on
distractionmadnessinsanity another Why did you send me out of
the coach in that cruel cruel way Write to me a word a linetell
me tell me I may come to youand leave me not in this agonising
condition your faithful glogglogglogthe whole glassJP

He never signed John Perkins in fullhe couldnt it was so unromantic

Well this missive was despatched by Mrs Snooks and Perkins in
a fearful state of excitement haggard wild and with more
brandyandwater awaited the return of his messenger

When at length after about an absence of forty years as it seemed to
him the old lady returned with a large packet Perkins seized it with
a trembling hand and was yet more frightened to see the handwriting of
Mrs or Miss Biggs

MY DEAR MR PERKINS she beganAlthough I am not your souls adored
I performed her part for once since I have read your letter as I told
her You need not be very much alarmed although Lucy is at this moment
in bed and unwell for the poor girl has had a sad scene at her grand
uncles house in Baker Street and came home very much affected Rest
however will restore her for she is not one of your nervous sort and
I hope when you come in the morning you will see her as blooming as she
was when you went out today on that unlucky walk

See what Sir George Gorgon says of us all You wont challenge him I
know as he is to be your uncle and so I may show you his letter

Goodnight my dear John Do not go QUITE distracted before morning
and believe me your loving aunt
 JEMIMA BIGGS

 41 BAKER STREET 11th December

MAJORGENERAL SIR GEORGE GORGON has heard with the utmost disgust and
surprise of the engagement which Miss Lucy Gorgon has thought fit to
form

The MajorGeneral cannot conceal his indignation at the share which
Miss Biggs has taken in this disgraceful transaction

Sir George Gorgon puts an absolute veto upon all further communication
between his niece and the lowborn adventurer who has been admitted into
her society and begs to say that Lieutenant Fitch of the Lifeguards
is the gentleman who he intends shall marry Miss Gorgon

It is the MajorGenerals wish that on the 28th Miss Gorgon should be
ready to come to his house in Baker Street where she will be more safe
from impertinent intrusions than she has been in Mucklebury Square

 MRS BIGGS
 Caroline Place
 Mecklenburgh Square

When poor John Perkins read this epistle blank rage and wonder filled
his soul at the audacity of the little General who thus without
the smallest title in the world pretended to dispose of the hand
and fortune of his niece The fact is that Sir George had such a
transcendent notion of his own dignity and station that it never for a
moment entered his head that his niece or anybody else connected with
him should take a single step in life without previously receiving his
orders and Mr Fitch a baronets son having expressed an admiration
of Lucy Sir George had determined that his suit should be accepted and
really considered Lucys preference of another as downright treason

John Perkins determined on the death of Fitch as the very least
reparation that should satisfy him and vowed too that some of the
Generals blood should be shed for the words which he had dared to
utter

We have said that William Pitt Scully Esquire MP occupied the first
floor of Mr Perkinss house in Bedford Row and the reader is further
to be informed that an immense friendship had sprung up between these
two gentlemen The fact is that poor John was very much flattered
by Scullys notice and began in a very short time to fancy himself
a political personage for he had made several of Scullys speeches
written more than one letter from him to his constituents and in
a word acted as his gratis clerk At least a guinea a week did Mr
Perkins save to the pockets of Mr Scully and with hearty good will
too for he adored the great William Pitt and believed every word that
dropped from the pompous lips of that gentleman

Well after having discussed Sir George Gorgons letter poor Perkins
in the utmost fury of mind that his darling should be slandered so
feeling a desire for fresh air determined to descend to the garden and
smoke a cigar in that rural quiet spot The night was very calm The
moonbeams slept softly upon the herbage of Grays Inn gardens and
bathed with silver splendour Theobalds Row A million of little frisky
twinkling stars attended their queen who looked with bland round face
upon their gambols as they peeped in and out from the azure heavens
Along Grays Inn wall a lazy row of cabs stood listlessly for who would
call a cab on such a night Meanwhile their drivers at the alehouse
near smoked the short pipe or quaffed the foaming beer Perhaps from
Grays Inn Lane some broken sounds of Irish revelry might rise Issuing
perhaps from Raymond Buildings gate six lawyers clerks might whoop a
tipsy songor the loud watchman yell the passing hour but beyond this
all was silence and young Perkins as he sat in the summerhouse at the
bottom of the garden and contemplated the peaceful heaven felt some
influences of it entering into his soul and almost forgetting revenge
thought but of peace and love

Presently he was aware there was someone else pacing the garden
Who could it beNot Blatherwick for he passed the Sabbath with his
grandmamma at Clapham not Scully surely for he always went to Bethesda
Chapel and to a select prayermeeting afterwards Alas it WAS Scully
for though that gentleman SAID that he went to chapel we have it for
a fact that he did not always keep his promise and was at this moment
employed in rehearsing an extempore speech which he proposed to deliver
at St Stephens

Had I sir spouted he with folded arms slowly pacing to and
froHad I sir entertained the smallest possible intention of
addressing the House on the present occasionhum on the present
occasionI would have endeavoured to prepare myself in a way that
should have at least shown my sense of the greatness of the subject
before the Houses consideration and the nature of the distinguished
audience I have the honour to address I am sir a plain manborn
of the peoplemyself one of the people having won thank Heaven an
honourable fortune and position by my own honest labour and standing
here as I do

   

Here Mr Scully it may be said that he never made a speech without
bragging about himself and an excellent plan it is for people cannot
help believing you at lasthere I say Mr Scully who had one arm
raised felt himself suddenly tipped on the shoulder and heard a voice
saying Your money or your life

The honourable gentleman twirled round as if he had been shot the
papers on which a great part of this impromptu was written dropped from
his lifted hand and some of them were actually borne on the air into
neighbouring gardens The man was in fact in the direst fright

Its only I said Perkins with rather a forced laugh when he saw the
effect that his wit had produced

Only you And pray what the devwhat right have you toto come upon
a man of my rank in that way and disturb me in the midst of very
important meditations asked Mr Scully beginning to grow fierce

I want your advice said Perkins on a matter of the very greatest
importance to me You know my idea of marrying

Marry said Scully I thought you had given up that silly scheme And
how pray do you intend to live

Why my intended has a couple of hundreds a year and my clerkship in
the Tape and SealingWax Office will be as much more

ClerkshipTape and SealingWax OfficeGovernment sinecureWhy good
heavens John Perkins you dont tell ME that you are going to accept
any such thing

It is a very small salary certainly said John who had a decent
notion of his own merits but consider six months vacation two hours
in the day and those spent over the newspapers After all its

After all its a swindle roared out Mr Scullya swindle upon the
country an infamous tax upon the people who starve that you may
fatten in idleness But take this clerkship in the Tape and SealingWax
Office continued the patriot his bosom heaving with noble
indignation and his eye flashing the purest fireTAKE this
clerkship John Perkins and sanction tyranny by becoming one of its
agents sanction dishonesty by sharing in its plunderdo this BUT
never more be friend of mine Had I a child said the patriot clasping
his hands and raising his eyes to heaven I would rather see him dead
sirdead dead at my feet than the servant of a Government which all
honest men despise And here giving a searching glance at Perkins Mr
Scully began tramping up and down the garden in a perfect fury

Good heavens exclaimed the timid John Perkinsdont say SO My
dear Mr Scully Im not the dishonest character you suppose me to beI
never looked at the matter in this light IllIll consider of it
Ill tell Crampton that I will give up the place but for Heavens sake
dont let me forfeit YOUR friendship which is dearer to me than any
place in the world

Mr Scully pressed his hand and said nothing and though their
interview lasted a full halfhour longer during which they paced up and
down the gravel walk we shall not breathe a single syllable of their
conversation as it has nothing to do with our tale

The next morning after an interview with Miss Lucy John Perkins
Esquire was seen to issue from Mrs Biggss house looking particularly
pale melancholy and thoughtful and he did not stop until he reached a
certain door in Downing Street where was the office of a certain great
Minister and the offices of the clerks in his Lordships department

The head of them was Mr Josiah Crampton who has now to be introduced
to the public He was a little old gentleman some sixty years of age
maternal uncle to John Perkins a bachelor who had been about fortytwo
years employed in the department of which he was now the head

After waiting four hours in an anteroom where a number of Irishmen
some newspaper editors many pompouslooking political personages asking
for the first lord a few sauntering clerks and numbers of swift
active messengers passed to and froafter waiting for four hours
making drawings on the blottingbook and reading the Morning Post
for that day week Mr Perkins was informed that he might go into his
uncles room and did so accordingly

He found a little hard old gentleman seated at a table covered with
every variety of sealingwax blottingpaper envelopes despatchboxes
green tapers etc etc An immense fire was blazing in the grate an
immense sheetalmanack hung over that a screen three or four chairs
and a faded Turkey carpet formed the rest of the furniture of this
remarkable roomwhich I have described thus particularly because in
the course of a long official life I have remarked that such is the
invariable decoration of political rooms

Well John said the little hard old gentleman pointing to an
armchair Im told youve been here since eleven Why the deuce do you
come so early

I had important business answered Mr Perkins stoutly and as his
uncle looked up with a comical expression of wonder John began in a
solemn tone to deliver a little speech which he had composed and which
proved him to be a very worthy easy silly fellow

Sir said Mr Perkins you have known for some time past the nature
of my political opinions and the intimacy which I have had the honour
to form with onewith some of the leading members of the Liberal
party A grin from Mr Crampton When first by your kindness I was
promised the clerkship in the Tape and SealingWax Office my opinions
were not formed as they are now and having taken the advice of the
gentlemen with whom I actan enormous grinthe advice I say
of the gentlemen with whom I act and the counsel likewise of my own
conscience I am compelled with the deepest grief to say my dear
uncle that II

That youwhat sir exclaimed little Mr Crampton bouncing off his
chair You dont mean to say that you are such a fool as to decline the
place

I do decline the place said Perkins whose blood rose at the word
fool As a man of honour I cannot take it

Not take it and how are you to live On the rent of that house of
yours For by gad sir if you give up the clerkship I never will give
you a shilling

It cannot be helped said Mr Perkins looking as much like a martyr
as he possibly could and thinking himself a very fine fellow I have
talents sir which I hope to cultivate and am member of a profession
by which a man may hope to rise to the very highest offices of the
State

Profession talents offices of the State Are you mad John Perkins
that you come to me with such insufferable twaddle as this Why do you
think if you HAD been capable of rising at the bar I would have taken
so much trouble about getting you a place No sir you are too fond of
pleasure and bed and teaparties and smalltalk and reading novels
and playing the flute and writing sonnets You would no more rise
at the bar than my messenger sir It was because I knew your
dispositionthat hopeless careless irresolute goodhumour of
yoursthat I had determined to keep you out of danger by placing you
in a snug shelter where the storms of the world would not come near
you You must have principles forsooth and you must marry Miss Gorgon
of course and by the time you have gone ten circuits and had six
children you will have eaten up every shilling of your wifes fortune
and be as briefless as you are now Who the deuce has put all this
nonsense into your head I think I know

Mr Perkinss ears tingled as these hard words saluted them and he
scarcely knew whether he ought to knock his uncle down or fall at his
feet and say Uncle I have been a fool and I know it The fact is
that in his interview with Miss Gorgon and her aunt in the morning
when he came to tell them of the resolution he had formed to give up
the place both the ladies and John himself had agreed with a thousand
rapturous tears and exclamations that he was one of the noblest young
men that ever lived had acted as became himself and might with perfect
propriety give up the place his talents being so prodigious that no
power on earth could hinder him from being Lord Chancellor Indeed John
and Lucy had always thought the clerkship quite beneath him and were
not a little glad perhaps at finding a pretext for decently refusing
it But as Perkins was a young gentleman whose candour was such that he
was always swayed by the opinions of the last speaker he did begin to
feel now the truth of his uncles statements however disagreeable they
might be

Mr Crampton continued

I think I know the cause of your patriotism Has not William Pitt
Scully Esquire had something to do with it

Mr Perkins COULD not turn any redder than he was but confessed with
deep humiliation that he HAD consulted Mr Scully among other friends

Mr Crampton smileddrew a letter from a heap before him and tearing
off the signature handed over the document to his nephew It contained
the following paragraphs

Hawksby has sounded Scully we can have him any day we want him He
talks very big at present and says he would not take anything under
a This is absurd He has a Yorkshire nephew coming up to town and
wants a place for him There is one vacant in the Tape Office he says
have you not a promise of it

I cantI cant believe it said John this sir is some weak
invention of the enemy Scully is the most honourable man breathing

Mr Scully is a gentleman in a very fair way to make a fortune
answered Mr Crampton Look you Johnit is just as well for your sake
that I should give you the news a few weeks before the papers for I
dont want you to be ruined if I can help it as I dont wish to have
you on my hands We know all the particulars of Scullys history He was
a Tory attorney at Oldborough he was jilted by the present Lady Gorgon
turned Radical and fought Sir George in his own borough Sir George
would have had the peerage he is dying for had he not lost that second
seat bytheby my Lady will be here in five minutes and Scully
is now quite firm there Well my dear lad we have bought your
incorruptible Scully Look hereand Mr Crampton produced three

My dear John said Mr Crampton jingling his watchseals very
complacently I am letting you into fearful secrets The great common
end of party is to buy your opponentsthe great statesman buys them for
nothing

Here the attendant genius of Mr Crampton made his appearance and
whispered something to which the little gentleman said Show her
Ladyship inwhen the attendant disappeared

John said Mr Crampton with a very queer smile you cant stay in
this room while Lady Gorgon is with me but there is a little clerks
room behind the screen there where you can wait until I call you

John retired and as he closed the door of communication strange to
say little Mr Crampton sprang up and said Confound the young ninny
he has shut the door

Mr Crampton then remembering that he wanted a map in the next room
sprang into it left the door half open in coming out and was in
time to receive Her Ladyship with smiling face as she ushered by Mr
Strongitharm majestically sailed in



CHAPTER III


BEHIND THE SCENES

In issuing from and leaving open the door of the inner room Mr
Crampton had bestowed upon Mr Perkins a look so peculiarly arch that
even he simple as he was began to imagine that some mystery was about
to be cleared up or some mighty matter to be discussed Presently
he heard the wellknown voice of Lady Gorgon in conversation with his
uncle What could their talk be about Mr Perkins was dying to know
andshall we say itadvanced to the door on tiptoe and listened with
all his might

Her Ladyship that Juno of a woman if she had not borrowed Venuss
girdle to render herself irresistible at least had adopted a tender
coaxing wheedling frisky tone quite different from her ordinary
dignified style of conversation She called Mr Crampton a naughty man
for neglecting his old friends vowed that Sir George was quite hurt at
his not coming to dinenor fixing a day when he would comeand added
with a most engaging ogle that she had three fine girls at home
who would perhaps make an evening pass pleasantly even to such a gay
bachelor as Mr Crampton

Madam said he with much gravity the daughters of such a mother
must be charming but I who have seen your Ladyship am alas proof
against even them

Both parties here heaved tremendous sighs and affected to be wonderfully
unhappy about something

I wish after a pause said Lady GorgonI wish dear Mr Crampton
you would not use that odious title my Ladyship you know it always
makes me melancholy

Melancholy my dear Lady Gorgon and why

Because it makes me think of another title that ought to have been
mineours I speak for dear Sir Georges and my darling boys sake
Heaven knows not mine What a sad disappointment it has been to my
husband that after all his services all the promises he has had they
have never given him his peerage As for me you know

For you my dear madam I know quite well that you care for no such
bauble as a coronet except in so far as it may confer honour upon those
most dear to youexcellent wife and noble mother as you are Heigho
what a happy man is Sir George

Here there was another pause and if Mr Perkins could have seen what
was taking place behind the screen he would have beheld little Mr
Crampton looking into Lady Gorgons face with as lovesick a Romeogaze
as he could possibly counterfeit while her Ladyship blushing somewhat
and turning her own grey gogglers up to heaven received all his words
for gospel and sat fancying herself to be the best most meritorious
and most beautiful creature in the three kingdoms

You men are terrible flatterers continued she but you say right
for myself I value not these empty distinctions I am growing old Mr
Cramptonyes indeed I am although you smile so incredulouslyand
let me add that MY thoughts are fixed upon HIGHER things than earthly
crowns But tell me you who are all in all with Lord Bagwig are we
never to have our peerage His Majesty I know is not averse the
services of dear Sir George to a member of His Majestys august family
I know have been appreciated in the highest quarter Ever since the
peace we have had a promise Four hundred pounds has Sir George spent at
the Heralds Office I myself am of one of the most ancient families
in the kingdom Mr Crampton and the poor dear mans health is really
ruined by the anxious sickening feeling of hope so long delayed

Mr Crampton now assumed an air of much solemnity

My dear Lady Gorgon said he will you let me be frank with you and
will you promise solemnly that what I am going to tell you shall never
be repeated to a single soul

Lady Gorgon promised

Well then since the truth you must know you yourselves have been in
part the cause of the delay of which you complain You gave us two votes
five years ago you now only give us one If Sir George were to go up
to the Peers we should lose even that one vote and would it be common
sense in us to incur such a loss Mr Scully the Liberal would return
another Member of his own way of thinking and as for the Lords we
have you know a majority there

Oh that horrid man said Lady Gorgon cursing Mr Scully in her
heart and beginning to play a rapid tattoo with her feet that
miscreant that traitor thatthat attorney has been our ruin

Horrid man if you please but give me leave to tell you that the
horrid man is not the sole cause of your ruinif ruin you will call it
I am sorry to say that I do candidly think Ministers believe that Sir
George Gorgon has lost his influence in Oldborough as much through his
own fault as through Mr Scullys cleverness

Our own fault Good heavens Have we not done everythingeverything
that persons of our station in the county could do to keep those
misguided men Have we not remonstrated threatened taken away our
custom from the Mayor established a Conservative apothecaryin
fact done all that gentlemen could do But these are such times Mr
Crampton the spirit of revolution is abroad and the great families of
England are menaced by democratic insolence

This was Sir George Gorgons speech always after dinner and was
delivered by his lady with a great deal of stateliness Somewhat
perhaps to her annoyance Mr Crampton only smiled shook his head and
said

Nonsense my dear Lady Gorgonpardon the phrase but I am a plain old
man and call things by their names Now will you let me whisper in
your ear one word of truth You have tried all sorts of remonstrances
and exerted yourself to maintain your influence in every way except the
right one and that is

What in Heavens name

Conciliation We know your situation in the borough Mr Scullys
whole history and pardon me for saying so but we men in office know
everything yours

Lady Gorgons ears and cheeks now assumed the hottest hue of crimson
She thought of her former passages with Scully and of the days
whenbut never mind when for she suffered her veil to fall and buried
her head in the folds of her handkerchief Vain folds The wily
little Mr Crampton could see all that passed behind the cambric and
continued

Yes madam we know the absurd hopes that were formed by a certain
attorney twenty years since We know how up to this moment he boasts
of certain walks

With the governesswe were always with the governess shrieked out
Lady Gorgon clasping her hands She was not the wisest of women

With the governess of course said Mr Crampton firmly Do you
suppose that any man dare breathe a syllable against your spotless
reputation Never my dear madam but what I would urge is thisyou
have treated your disappointed admirer too cruelly

What the traitor who has robbed us of our rights

He never would have robbed you of your rights if you had been more kind
to him You should be gentle madam you should forgive himyou should
be friends with him

With a traitor never

Think what made him a traitor Lady Gorgon look in your glass and say
if there be not some excuse for him Think of the feelings of the man
who saw beauty such as yoursI am a plain man and must speakvirtue
such as yours in the possession of a rival By heavens madam I think
he was RIGHT to hate Sir George Gorgon Would you have him allow such a
prize to be ravished from him without a pang on his part

He was I believe very much attached to me said Lady Gorgon quite
delighted but you must be aware that a young man of his station in
life could not look up to a person of my rank

Surely not it was monstrous pride and arrogance in Mr Scully But
que voulezvous Such is the worlds way Scully could not help loving
youwho that knows you can I am a plain man and say what I think
He loves you still Why make an enemy of him who would at a word be at
your feet Dearest Lady Gorgon listen to me Sir George Gorgon and Mr
Scully have already mettheir meeting was our contrivance It is for
our interest for yours that they should be friends If there were two
Ministerial Members for Oldborough do you think your husbands peerage
would be less secure I am not at liberty to tell you all I know on this
subject but do I entreat you be reconciled to him

And after a little more conversation which was carried on by Mr
Crampton in the same tender way this important interview closed and
Lady Gorgon folding her shawl round her threaded certain mysterious
passages and found her way to her carriage in Whitehall

I hope you have not been listening you rogue said Mr Crampton to
his nephew who blushed most absurdly by way of answer You would have
heard great State secrets if you had dared to do so That woman is
perpetually here and if peerages are to be had for the asking she
ought to have been a duchess by this time I would not have admitted her
but for a reason that I have Go you now and ponder upon what you have
heard and seen Be on good terms with Scully and above all speak not
a word concerning our interviewno not a word even to your mistress
By the way I presume sir you will recall your resignation

The bewildered Perkins was about to stammer out a speech when his
uncle cutting it short pushed him gently out of the door

   

At the period when the important events occurred which have been
recorded here parties ran very high and a mighty struggle for the
vacant Speakership was about to come on The Right Honourable Robert
Pincher was the Ministerial candidate and Sir Charles Macabaw was
patronised by the Opposition The two Members for Oldborough of course
took different sides the baronet being of the Pincher faction while
Mr William Pitt Scully strongly supported the Macabaw party

It was Mr Scullys intention to deliver an impromptu speech upon the
occasion of the election and he and his faithful Perkins prepared
it between them for the latter gentleman had wisely kept his uncles
counsel and his own and Mr Scully was quite ignorant of the conspiracy
that was brooding Indeed so artfully had that young Machiavel of a
Perkins conducted himself that when asked by his patron whether he had
given up his place in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office he replied that
he HAD tendered his resignation but did not say one word about having
recalled it

You were right my boy quite right said Mr Scully A man of
uncompromising principles should make no compromise And herewith he
sat down and wrote off a couple of letters one to Mr Hawksby telling
him that the place in the SealingWax Office was as he had reason to
know vacant and the other to his nephew stating that it was to be
his Under the rose my dear Bob added Mr Scully it will cost you
five hundred pounds but you cannot invest your money better

It is needless to state that the affair was to be conducted with the
strictest secresy and honour and that the money was to pass through
Mr Scullys hands

While however the great Pincher and Macabaw question was yet
undecided an event occurred to Mr Scully which had a great influence
upon his afterlife A second grand banquet was given at the Earl of
Mantraps Lady Mantrap requested him to conduct Lady Gorgon to dinner
and the latter with a charming timidity and a gracious melancholy look
into his face after which her veined eyelids veiled her azure eyes
put her hand into the trembling one of Mr Scully and said as much as
looks could say Forgive and forget

Down went Scully to dinner There were dukes on his right hand and earls
on his left there were but two persons without title in the midst of
that glittering assemblage the very servants looked like noblemen The
cook had done wonders the wines were cool and rich and Lady Gorgon was
splendid What attention did everybody pay to her and to him Why WOULD
she go on gazing into his face with that tender imploring look In
other words Scully after partaking of soup and fish he during their
discussion had been thinking over all the former loveandhate passages
between himself and Lady Gorgon turned very red and began talking to
her

Were you not at the opera on Tuesday began he assuming at once the
airs of a man of fashion I thought I caught a glimpse of you in the
Duchess of Diddleburys box

Opera Mr Scully pronouncing the word Scully with the utmost
softness Ah no we seldom go and yet too often For serious persons
the enchantments of that place are too dangerous I am so nervousso
delicate the smallest trifle so agitates depresses or irritates me
that I dare not yield myself up to the excitement of music I am too
passionately attached to it and shall I tell you it has such a
strange influence upon me that the smallest false note almost drives me
to distraction and for that very reason I hardly ever go to a concert
or a ball

Egad thought Scully I recollect when she would dance down a matter
of fiveandforty couple and jingle away at the Battle of Prague all
day

She continued Dont you recollect I do withoh what regretthat
day at Oldborough raceball when I behaved with such sad rudeness to
you You will scarcely believe me and yet I assure you tis the fact
the music had made me almost mad Do let me ask your pardon for my
conduct I was not myself Oh Mr Scully I am no worldly woman I
know my duties and I feel my wrongs Nights and days have I lain awake
weeping and thinking of that unhappy daythat I should ever speak so to
an old friend for we WERE old friends were we not

Scully did not speak but his eyes were bursting out of his head and
his face was the exact colour of a deputylieutenants uniform

That I should ever forget myself and you so How I have been longing
for this opportunity to ask you to forgive me I asked Lady Mantrap
when I heard you were to be here to invite me to her party Come I
know you will forgive meyour eyes say you will You used to look so in
old days and forgive me my caprices THEN Do give me a little winewe
will drink to the memory of old days

Her eyes filled with tears and poor Scullys hand caused such a
rattling and trembling of the glass and the decanter that the Duke
of Doldrumwho had been during the course of this whispered
sentimentality describing a famous run with the Queens hounds at the
top of his voicestopped at the jingling of the glass and his tale
was lost for ever Scully hastily drank his wine and Lady Gorgon turned
round to her next neighbour a little gentleman in black between whom
and herself certain conscious looks passed

I am glad poor Sir George is not here said he smiling

Lady Gorgon said Pooh for shame The little gentleman was no other
than Josiah Crampton Esquire that eminent financier and he was now
going through the curious calculation before mentioned by which you BUY
A MAN FOR NOTHING He intended to pay the very same price for Sir George
Gorgon too but there was no need to tell the baronet so only of this
the reader must be made aware

While Mr Crampton was conducting this intrigue which was to bring a
new recruit to the Ministerial ranks his mighty spirit condescended to
ponder upon subjects of infinitely less importance and to arrange plans
for the welfare of his nephew and the young woman to whom he had made
a present of his heart These young persons as we said before had
arranged to live in Mr Perkinss own house in Bedford Row It was of a
peculiar construction and might more properly be called a house and
a half for a snug little tenement of four chambers protruded from the
back of the house into the garden These rooms communicated with the
drawingrooms occupied by Mr Scully and Perkins who acted as his
friend and secretary used frequently to sit in the one nearest the
Members study in order that he might be close at hand to confer
with that great man The rooms had a private entrance too were newly
decorated and in them the young couple proposed to live the kitchen
and garrets being theirs likewise What more could they need We
are obliged to be particular in describing these apartments for
extraordinary events occurred therein

To say the truth until the present period Mr Crampton had taken no
great interest in his nephews marriage or indeed in the young man
himself The old gentleman was of a saturnine turn and inclined
to undervalue the qualities of Mr Perkins which were idleness
simplicity enthusiasm and easy goodnature

Such fellows never do anything in the world he would say and for
such he had accordingly the most profound contempt But when after
John Perkinss repeated entreaties he had been induced to make the
acquaintance of Miss Gorgon he became instantly charmed with her and
warmly espoused her cause against her overbearing relations

At his suggestion she wrote back to decline Sir George Gorgons
peremptory invitation and hinted at the same time that she had attained
an age and a position which enabled her to be the mistress of her own
actions To this letter there came an answer from Lady Gorgon which we
shall not copy but which simply stated that Miss Lucy Gorgons conduct
was unchristian ungrateful unladylike and immodest that the Gorgon
family disowned her for the future and left her at liberty to form
whatever base connections she pleased

A pretty world this said Mr Crampton in a great rage when the
letter was shown to him This same fellow Scully dissuades my nephew
from taking a place because Scully wants it for himself This prude of
a Lady Gorgon cries out shame and disowns an innocent amiable girl she
a heartless jilt herself once and a heartless flirt now The Pharisees
the Pharisees And to call mine a base family too

Now Lady Gorgon did not in the least know Mr Cramptons connection
with Mr Perkins or she would have been much more guarded in her
language but whether she knew it or not the old gentleman felt a huge
indignation and determined to have his revenge

Thats right Uncle SHALL I call Gorgon out said the impetuous young
Perkins who was all for blood

John you are a fool said his uncle You shall have a better
revenge you shall be married from Sir George Gorgons house and you
shall see Mr William Pitt Scully sold for nothing This to the veteran
diplomatist seemed to be the highest triumph which man could possibly
enjoy

It was very soon to take place and as has been the case ever since the
world began woman lovely woman was to be the cause of Scullys fall
The tender scene at Lord Mantraps was followed by many others equally
sentimental Sir George Gorgon called upon his colleague the very next
day and brought with him a card from Lady Gorgon inviting Mr Scully
to dinner The attorney eagerly accepted the invitation was received
in Baker Street by the whole amiable family with much respectful
cordiality and was pressed to repeat his visits as country neighbours
should More than once did he call and somehow always at the hour when
Sir George was away at his club or riding in the Park or elsewhere
engaged Sir George Gorgon was very old very feeble very much
shattered in constitution Lady Gorgon used to impart her fears to Mr
Scully every time he called there and the sympathising attorney used to
console her as best he might Sir Georges country agent neglected the
propertyhis lady consulted Mr Scully concerning it He knew to a
fraction how large her jointure was how she was to have Gorgon Castle
for her life and how in the event of the young baronets death he
too was a sickly poor boy the chief part of the estates bought by
her money would be at her absolute disposal

What a pity these odious politics prevent me from having you for our
agent would Lady Gorgon say and indeed Scully thought it was a pity
too Ambitious Scully what wild notions filled his brain He used to
take leave of Lady Gorgon and ruminate upon these things and when he
was gone Sir George and her Ladyship used to laugh

If we can but commit himif we can but make him vote for Pincher
said the General my peerage is secure Hawksby and Crampton as good as
told me so

The point had been urged upon Mr Scully repeatedly and adroitly Is
not Pincher a more experienced man than Macabaw would Sir George say
to his guest over their wine Scully allowed it Cant you vote for
him on personal grounds and say so in the House Scully wished he
couldhow he wished he could Every time the General coughed Scully
saw his friends desperate situation more and more and thought how
pleasant it would be to be lord of Gorgon Castle Knowing my property
cried Sir George as you do and with your talents and integrity what
a comfort it would be could I leave you as guardian to my boy But these
cursed politics prevent it my dear fellow Why WILL you be a Radical
And Scully cursed politics too Hang the lowbred rogue added Sir
George when William Pitt Scully left the house he will do everything
but promise

My dear General said Lady Gorgon sidling up to him and patting him
on his old yellow cheekMy dear Georgy tell me one thingare you
jealous

Jealous my dear and jealous of THAT fellowpshaw

Well then give me leave and you shall have the promise tomorrow

   

Tomorrow arrived It was a remarkably fine day and in the forenoon
Mr Perkins gave his accustomed knock at Scullys study which was only
separated from his own sittingroom by a double door John had wisely
followed his uncles advice and was on the best terms with the
honourable Member

Here are a few sentences said he which I think may suit
your purpose Great public servicesundeniable merityears of
integritycause of reform and Macabaw for ever He put down the
paper It was in fact a speech in favour of Mr Macabaw

Hush said Scully rather surlily for he was thinking how
disagreeable it was to support Macabaw and besides there were clerks
in the room whom the thoughtless Perkins had not at first perceived As
soon as that gentleman saw them You are busy I see continued he in
a lower tone I came to say that I must be off duty today for I am
engaged to take a walk with some ladies of my acquaintance

So saying the lighthearted young man placed his hat unceremoniously on
his head and went off through his own door humming a song He was in
such high spirits that he did not even think of closing the doors of
communication and Scully looked after him with a sneer

Ladies forsooth thought he I know who they are This precious girl
that he is fooling with for one I suppose He was right Perkins was
off on the wings of love to see Miss Lucy and she and Aunt Biggs
and Uncle Crampton had promised this very day to come and look at the
apartments which Mrs John Perkins was to occupy with her happy husband

Poor devil so continued Mr Scullys meditations it is almost too
bad to do him out of his place but my Bob wants it and Johns girl
has I hear seven thousand pounds His uncle will get him another place
before all that money is spent And herewith Mr Scully began conning
the speech which Perkins had made for him

He had not read it more than six timesin truth he was getting it by
heartwhen his head clerk came to him from the front room bearing
a card a footman had brought it who said his lady was waiting below
Lady Gorgons name was on the card To seize his hat and rush downstairs
was with Mr Scully the work of an infinitesimal portion of time

It was indeed Lady Gorgon in her Gorgonian chariot

Mr Scully said she popping her head out of window and smiling in a
most engaging way I want to speak to you on something very particular
INDEEDand she held him out her hand Scully pressed it most tenderly
he hoped all heads in Bedford Row were at the windows to see him I
cant ask you into the carriage for you see the governess is with me
and I want to talk secrets to you

Shall I go and make a little promenade said mademoiselle innocently
And her mistress hated her for that speech

No Mr Scully I am sure will let me come in for five minutes

Mr Scully was only too happy My Lady descended and walked upstairs
leaning on the happy solicitors arm But how should he manage The
front room was consecrated to clerks there were clerks too as illluck
would have it in his private room Perkins is out for the day
thought Scully I will take her into his room And into Perkinss
room he took heray and he shut the double doors after him too and
trembled as he thought of his own happiness

What a charming little study said Lady Gorgon seating herself And
indeed it was very pretty for Perkins had furnished it beautifully and
laid out a neat tray with cakes a cold fowl and sherry to entertain
his party withal And do you bachelors always live so well continued
she pointing to the little cold collation

Mr Scully looked rather blank when he saw it and a dreadful suspicion
crossed his soul but there was no need to trouble Lady Gorgon with
explanations therefore at once and with much presence of mind he
asked her to partake of his bachelors fare she would refuse Mr Scully
nothing that day A pretty sight would it have been for young Perkins
to see strangers so unceremoniously devouring his feast She drankMr
Scully drankand so emboldened was he by the draught that he actually
seated himself by the side of Lady Gorgon on John Perkinss new sofa

Her Ladyship had of course something to say to him She was a pious
woman and had suddenly conceived a violent wish for building a chapel
of ease at Oldborough to which she entreated him to subscribe She
enlarged upon the benefits that the town would derive from it spoke
of Sundayschools sweet spiritual instruction and the duty of all
wellminded persons to give aid to the scheme

I will subscribe a hundred pounds said Scully at the end of her
Ladyships harangue would I not do anything for you

Thank you thank you dear Mr Scully said the enthusiastic woman
How the dear went burning through his soul Ah added she if
you WOULD but do anything for meif you who are so eminently so truly
distinguished in a religious point of view would but see the truth
in politics too and if I could see your name among those of the true
patriot party in this empire how blestoh how blest should I be Poor
Sir George often says he should go to his grave happy could he but
see you the guardian of his boy and I your old friend for we WERE
friends William how have I wept to think of you as one of those who
are bringing our monarchy to ruin Do do promise me this too And she
took his hand and pressed it between hers

The heart of William Pitt Scully during this speech was thumping
up and down with a frightful velocity and strength His old love the
agency of the Gorgon propertythe dear widowfive thousand a year
cleara thousand delicious hopes rushed madly through his brain and
almost took away his reason And there she satshe the loved one
pressing his hand and looking softly into his eyes

Down down he plumped on his knees

Juliana shrieked he dont take away your hand My lovemy only
lovespeak but those blessed words again Call me William once more
and do with me what you will

Juliana cast down her eyes and said in the very smallest type
William

   
when the door opened and in walked Mr Crampton leading Mrs Biggs
who could hardly contain herself for laughing and Mr John Perkins who
was squeezing the arm of Miss Lucy They had heard every word of the two
last speeches

For at the very moment when Lady Gorgon had stopped at Mr Scullys
door the four abovenamed individuals had issued from Great James
Street into Bedford Row

Lucy cried out that it was her aunts carriage and they all saw Mr
Scully come out bareheaded in the sunshine and my Lady descend and
the pair go into the house They meanwhile entered by Mr Perkinss own
private door and had been occupied in examining the delightful rooms
on the groundfloor which were to be his diningroom and libraryfrom
which they ascended a stair to visit the other two rooms which were to
form Mrs John Perkinss drawingroom and bedroom Now whether it was
that they trod softly or that the stairs were covered with a grand new
carpet and drugget as was the case or that the party within were too
much occupied in themselves to heed any outward disturbances I know
not but Lucy who was advancing with John he was saying something
about one of the apartments the rogueLucy started and whispered
There is somebody in the rooms and at that instant began the speech
already reported THANK YOU THANK YOU DEAR MR SCULLY etc etc
which was delivered by Lady Gorgon in a full clear voice for to do her
Ladyship justice SHE had not one single grain of love for Mr Scully
and during the delivery of her little oration was as cool as the
coolest cucumber

Then began the impassioned rejoinder to which the four listened on
the landingplace and then the little William as narrated above at
which juncture Mr Crampton thought proper to rattle at the door and
after a brief pause to enter with his party

William had had time to bounce off his knees and was on a chair at
the other end of the room

What Lady Gorgon said Mr Crampton with excellent surprise how
delighted I am to see you Always I see employed in works of charity
the chapelofease paper was on her knees and on such an occasion
tooit is really the most wonderful coincidence My dear madam here
is a silly fellow a nephew of mine who is going to marry a silly girl
a niece of your own

Sir I began Lady Gorgon rising

They heard every word whispered Mr Crampton eagerly Come forward
Mr Perkins and show yourself Mr Perkins made a genteel bow Miss
Lucy please to shake hands with your aunt and this my dear madam is
Mrs Biggs of Mecklenburgh Square who if she were not too old might
marry a gentleman in the Treasury who is your very humble servant And
with this gallant speech old Mr Crampton began helping everybody to
sherry and cake

As for William Pitt Scully he had disappeared evaporated in the
most absurd sneaking way imaginable Lady Gorgon made good her retreat
presently with much dignity her countenance undismayed and her face
turned resolutely to the foe

   

About five days afterwards that memorable contest took place in the
House of Commons in which the partisans of Mr Macabaw were so very
nearly getting him the Speakership On the day that the report of the
debate appeared in the Times there appeared also an announcement in the
Gazette as follows

The King has been pleased to appoint John Perkins Esquire to be
DeputySubcomptroller of His Majestys Tape Office and Custos of the
SealingWax Department

Mr Crampton showed this to his nephew with great glee and was
chuckling to think how Mr William Pitt Scully would be annoyed who
had expected the place when Perkins burst out laughing and said By
heavens here is my own speech Scully has spoken every word of it he
has only put in Mr Pinchers name in the place of Mr Macabaws

He is ours now responded his uncle and I told you WE WOULD HAVE HIM
FOR NOTHING I told you too that you should be married from Sir George
Gorgons and here is proof of it

It was a letter from Lady Gorgon in which she said that had she known
Mr Perkins to be a nephew of her friend Mr Crampton she never for
a moment would have opposed his marriage with her niece and she
had written that morning to her dear Lucy begging that the marriage
breakfast should take place in Baker Street

It shall be in Mecklenburgh Square said John Perkins stoutly and in
Mecklenburgh Square it was

William Pitt Scully Esquire was as Mr Crampton said hugely annoyed
at the loss of the place for his nephew He had still however his
hopes to look forward to but these were unluckily dashed by the coming
in of the Whigs As for Sir George Gorgon when he came to ask about his
peerage Hawksby told him that they could not afford to lose him in the
Commons for a Liberal Member would infallibly fill his place

And now that the Tories are out and the Whigs are in strange to say a
Liberal does fill his place This Liberal is no other than Sir George
Gorgon himself who is still longing to be a lord and his lady is still
devout and intriguing So that the Members for Oldborough have
changed sides and taunt each other with apostasy and hate each other
cordially Mr Crampton still chuckles over the manner in which he
tricked them both and talks of those five minutes during which he
stood on the landingplace and hatched and executed his BedfordRow
Conspiracy
