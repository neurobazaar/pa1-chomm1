STORY THE FIRSTPeter Hope plans his Prospectus


Come in said Peter Hope

Peter Hope was tall and thin cleanshaven but for a pair of side
whiskers closecropped and terminating just below the ear with hair of
the kind referred to by sympathetic barbers as getting a little thin on
the top sir but arranged with economy that everywhere is povertys
true helpmate About Mr Peter Hopes linen which was white though
somewhat frayed there was a selfassertiveness that invariably arrested
the attention of even the most casual observer Decidedly there was too
much of itits ostentation aided and abetted by the retiring nature of
the cutaway coat whose chief aim clearly was to slip off and disappear
behind its owners back Im a poor old thing it seemed to say I
dont shineor rather I shine too much among these uptodate young
modes I only hamper you You would be much more comfortable without
me To persuade it to accompany him its proprietor had to employ
force keeping fastened the lowest of its three buttons At every step
it struggled for its liberty Another characteristic of Peters linking
him to the past was his black silk cravat secured by a couple of gold
pins chained together Watching him as he now sat writing his long legs
encased in tightly strapped grey trousering crossed beneath the table
the lamplight falling on his freshcomplexioned face upon the shapely
hand that steadied the halfwritten sheet a stranger might have rubbed
his eyes wondering by what hallucination he thus found himself in
presence seemingly of some young beau belonging to the early forties
but looking closer would have seen the many wrinkles

Come in repeated Mr Peter Hope raising his voice but not his eyes

The door opened and a small white face out of which gleamed a pair of
bright black eyes was thrust sideways into the room

Come in repeated Mr Peter Hope for the third time Who is it

A hand not over clean grasping a greasy cloth cap appeared below the
face

Not ready yet said Mr Hope Sit down and wait

The door opened wider and the whole of the figure slid in and closing
the door behind it sat itself down upon the extreme edge of the chair
nearest

Which are you_Central News_ or _Courier_ demanded Mr Peter Hope
but without looking up from his work

The bright black eyes which had just commenced an examination of the
room by a careful scrutiny of the smokegrimed ceiling descended and
fixed themselves upon the one clearly defined bald patch upon his head
that had he been aware of it would have troubled Mr Peter Hope But
the full red lips beneath the turnedup nose remained motionless

That he had received no answer to his question appeared to have escaped
the attention of Mr Peter Hope The thin white hand moved steadily to
and fro across the paper Three more sheets were added to those upon the
floor Then Mr Peter Hope pushed back his chair and turned his gaze for
the first time upon his visitor

To Peter Hope hack journalist long familiar with the genus Printers
Devil small white faces tangled hair dirty hands and greasy caps were
common objects in the neighbourhood of that buried rivulet the Fleet
But this was a new species Peter Hope sought his spectacles found them
after some trouble under a heap of newspapers adjusted them upon his
high arched nose leant forward and looked long and up and down

God bless my soul said Mr Peter Hope What is it

The figure rose to its full height of five foot one and came forward
slowly

Over a tightfitting garibaldi of blue silk excessively _decollete_ it
wore what once had been a boys pepperandsalt jacket A worsted
comforter wound round the neck still left a wide expanse of throat
showing above the garibaldi Below the jacket fell a long black skirt
the train of which had been looped up about the waist and fastened with a
cricketbelt

Who are you What do you want asked Mr Peter Hope

For answer the figure passing the greasy cap into its other hand
stooped down and seizing the front of the long skirt began to haul it
up

Dont do that said Mr Peter Hope I say you know you

But by this time the skirt had practically disappeared leaving to view a
pair of muchpatched trousers diving into the righthand pocket of which
the dirty hand drew forth a folded paper which having opened and
smoothed out it laid upon the desk

Mr Peter Hope pushed up his spectacles till they rested on his eyebrows
and read aloudSteak and Kidney Pie 4d Do large size _6d_
Boiled Mutton

Thats where Ive been for the last two weeks said the
figureHammonds Eating House

The listener noted with surprise that the voicethough it told him as
plainly as if he had risen and drawn aside the red rep curtains that
outside in Gough Square the yellow fog lay like the ghost of a dead
seabetrayed no Cockney accent found no difficulty with its aitches

You ask for Emma Shell say a good word for me She told me so

But my good Mr Peter Hope checking himself sought again the
assistance of his glasses The glasses being unable to decide the point
their owner had to put the question bluntly

Are you a boy or a girl

I dunno

You dont know

Whats the difference

Mr Peter Hope stood up and taking the strange figure by the shoulders
turned it round slowly twice apparently under the impression that the
process might afford to him some clue But it did not

What is your name

Tommy

Tommy what

Anything you like I dunno Ive had so many of em

What do you want What have you come for

Youre Mr Hope aint you second floor 16 Gough Square

That is my name

You want somebody to do for you

You mean a housekeeper

Didnt say anything about housekeeper Said you wanted somebody to do
for youcook and clean the place up Heard em talking about it in the
shop this afternoon Old lady in green bonnet was asking Mother Hammond
if she knew of anyone

Mrs Postwhistleyes I did ask her to look out for someone for me
Why do you know of anyone Have you been sent by anybody

You dont want anything too laborate in the way o cooking You was a
simple old chap so they said not much trouble

Nono I dont want muchsomeone clean and respectable But why
couldnt she come herself Who is it

Well whats wrong about me

I beg your pardon said Mr Peter Hope

Why wont I do I can make beds and clean roomsall that sort o
thing As for cooking Ive got a natural aptitude for it You ask
Emma shell tell you You dont want nothing laborate

Elizabeth said Mr Peter Hope as he crossed and taking up the poker
proceeded to stir the fire are we awake or asleep

Elizabeth thus appealed to raised herself on her hind legs and dug her
claws into her masters thigh Mr Hopes trousers being thin it was
the most practical answer she could have given him

Done a lot of looking after other people for their benefit continued
Tommy Dont see why I shouldnt do it for my own

My dearI do wish I knew whether you were a boy or a girl Do you
seriously suggest that I should engage you as my housekeeper asked Mr
Peter Hope now upright with his back to the fire

Id do for you all right persisted Tommy You give me my grub and a
shakedown and say sixpence a week and Ill grumble less than most of
em

Dont be ridiculous said Mr Peter Hope

You wont try me

Of course not you must be mad

All right No harm done The dirty hand reached out towards the desk
and possessing itself again of Hammonds Bill of Fare commenced the
operations necessary for bearing it away in safety

Heres a shilling for you said Mr Peter Hope

Rather not said Tommy Thanks all the same

Nonsense said Mr Peter Hope

Rather not repeated Tommy Never know where that sort of thing may
lead you to

All right said Mr Peter Hope replacing the coin in his pocket
Dont

The figure moved towards the door

Wait a minute Wait a minute said Mr Peter Hope irritably

The figure with its hand upon the door stood still

Are you going back to Hammonds

No Ive finished there Only took me on for a couple o weeks while
one of the gals was ill She came back this morning

Who are your people

Tommy seemed puzzled What dye mean

Well whom do you live with

Nobody

Youve got nobody to look after youto take care of you

Take care of me Dye think Im a bloomin kid

Then where are you going to now

Going Out

Peter Hopes irritation was growing

I mean where are you going to sleep Got any money for a lodging

Yes Ive got some money answered Tommy But I dont think much o
lodgings Not a particular nice class as you meet there I shall sleep
out tonight Taint raining

Elizabeth uttered a piercing cry

Serves you right growled Peter savagely How can anyone help
treading on you when you will get just between ones legs Told you of
it a hundred times

The truth of the matter was that Peter was becoming very angry with
himself For no reason whatever as he told himself his memory would
persist in wandering to Ilford Cemetery in a certain desolate corner of
which lay a fragile little woman whose lungs had been but ill adapted to
breathing London fogs with on the top of her a still smaller and still
more fragile mite of humanity that in compliment to its only relative
worth a pennypiece had been christened Thomasa name common enough in
all conscience as Peter had reminded himself more than once In the
name of common sense what had dead and buried Tommy Hope to do with this
affair The whole thing was the veriest sentiment and sentiment was Mr
Peter Hopes abomination Had he not penned articles innumerable
pointing out its baneful influence upon the age Had he not always
condemned it wherever he had come across it in play or book Now and
then the suspicion had crossed Peters mind that in spite of all this
he was somewhat of a sentimentalist himselfthings had suggested this to
him The fear had always made him savage

You wait here till I come back he growled seizing the astonished
Tommy by the worsted comforter and spinning it into the centre of the
room Sit down and dont you dare to move And Peter went out and
slammed the door behind him

Bit off his chump aint he remarked Tommy to Elizabeth as the sound
of Peters descending footsteps died away People had a way of
addressing remarks to Elizabeth Something in her manner invited this

Oh well its all in the days work commented Tommy cheerfully and
sat down as bid

Five minutes passed maybe ten Then Peter returned accompanied by a
large restful lady to whom surpriseone felt it instinctivelyhad
always been and always would remain an unknown quantity

Tommy rose

Thats thethe article explained Peter

Mrs Postwhistle compressed her lips and slightly tossed her head It
was the attitude of not illnatured contempt from which she regarded most
human affairs

Thats right said Mrs Postwhistle I remember seeing er
thereleastways it was an er right enough then What ave you done
with your clothes

They werent mine explained Tommy They were things what Mrs
Hammond had lent me

Is that your own asked Mrs Postwhistle indicating the blue silk
garibaldi

Yes

What went with it

Tights They were too far gone

What made you give up the tumbling business and go to Mrs Ammonds

It gave me up Hurt myself

Who were you with last

Martini troupe

And before that

Oh heaps of em

Nobody ever told you whether you was a boy or a girl

Nobody as Id care to believe Some of them called me the one some of
them the other It depended upon what was wanted

How old are you

I dunno

Mrs Postwhistle turned to Peter who was jingling keys

Well theres the bed upstairs Its for you to decide

What I dont want to do explained Peter sinking his voice to a
confidential whisper is to make a fool of myself

Thats always a good rule agreed Mrs Postwhistle for those to whom
its possible

Anyhow said Peter one night cant do any harm Tomorrow we can
think whats to be done

Tomorrow had always been Peters lucky day At the mere mention of
the magic date his spirits invariably rose He now turned upon Tommy a
countenance from which all hesitation was banished

Very well Tommy said Mr Peter Hope you can sleep here tonight Go
with Mrs Postwhistle and shell show you your room

The black eyes shone

Youre going to give me a trial

Well talk about all that tomorrow The black eyes clouded

Look here I tell you straight it aint no good

What do you mean What isnt any good demanded Peter

Youll want to send me to prison

To prison

Oh yes Youll call it a school I know You aint the first thats
tried that on It wont work The bright black eyes were flashing
passionately I aint done any harm Im willing to work I can keep
myself I always have Whats it got to do with anybody else

Had the bright black eyes retained their expression of passionate
defiance Peter Hope might have retained his common sense Only Fate
arranged that instead they should suddenly fill with wild tears And at
sight of them Peters common sense went out of the room disgusted and
there was born the history of many things

Dont be silly said Peter You didnt understand Of course Im
going to give you a trial Youre going to do for me I merely meant
that wed leave the details till tomorrow Come housekeepers dont
cry

The little wet face looked up

You mean it Honour bright

Honour bright Now go and wash yourself Then you shall get me my
supper

The odd figure still heaving from its paroxysm of sobs stood up

And I have my grub my lodging and sixpence a week

Yes yes I think thats a fair arrangement agreed Mr Peter Hope
considering Dont you Mrs Postwhistle

With a frockor a suit of trousersthrown in suggested Mrs
Postwhistle Its generally done

If its the custom certainly agreed Mr Peter Hope Sixpence a week
and clothes

And this time it was Peter that in company with Elizabeth sat waiting
the return of Tommy

I rather hope said Peter its a boy It was the fogs you know If
only I could have afforded to send him away

Elizabeth looked thoughtful The door opened

Ah thats better much better said Mr Peter Hope Pon my word
you look quite respectable

By the practical Mrs Postwhistle a working agreement benefiting both
parties had been arrived at with the longtrained skirt while an ample
shawl arranged with judgment disguised the nakedness that lay below
Peter a fastidious gentleman observed with satisfaction that the hands
now clean had been well cared for

Give me that cap said Peter He threw it in the glowing fire It
burned brightly diffusing strange odours

Theres a travelling cap of mine hanging up in the passage You can
wear that for the present Take this halfsovereign and get me some cold
meat and beer for supper Youll find everything else you want in that
sideboard or else in the kitchen Dont ask me a hundred questions and
dont make a noise and Peter went back to his work

Good idea that halfsovereign said Peter Shant be bothered with
Master Tommy any more dont expect Starting a nursery at our time of
life Madness Peters pen scratched and spluttered Elizabeth kept
an eye upon the door

Quarter of an hour said Peter looking at his watch Told you so
The article on which Peter was now engaged appeared to be of a worrying
nature

Then why said Peter why did he refuse that shilling Artfulness
concluded Peter pure artfulness Elizabeth old girl weve got out of
this business cheaply Good idea that halfsovereign Peter gave vent
to a chuckle that had the effect of alarming Elizabeth

But luck evidently was not with Peter that night

Pingles was sold out explained Tommy entering with parcels had to
go to Bows in Farringdon Street

Oh said Peter without looking up

Tommy passed through into the little kitchen behind Peter wrote on
rapidly making up for lost time

Good murmured Peter smiling to himself thats a neat phrase That
ought to irritate them

Now as he wrote while with noiseless footsteps Tommy unseen behind
him moved to and fro and in and out the little kitchen there came to
Peter Hope this very curious experience it felt to him as if for a long
time he had been illso ill as not even to have been aware of itand
that now he was beginning to be himself again consciousness of things
returning to him This solidly furnished long oakpanelled room with
its air of oldworld dignity and reposethis sober kindly room in which
for more than half his life he had lived and workedwhy had he forgotten
it It came forward greeting him with an amused smile as of some old
friend long parted from The faded photos in stiff wooden frames upon
the chimneypiece among them that of the fragile little woman with the
unadaptable lungs

God bless my soul said Mr Peter Hope pushing back his chair Its
thirty years ago How time does fly Why let me see I must be

Dyou like it with a head on it demanded Tommy who had been waiting
patiently for signs

Peter shook himself awake and went to his supper

A bright idea occurred to Peter in the night Of course why didnt I
think of it before Settle the question at once Peter fell into an
easy sleep

Tommy said Peter as he sat himself down to breakfast the next
morning Bytheby asked Peter with a puzzled expression putting
down his cup what is this

Cauffee informed him Tommy You said cauffee

Oh replied Peter For the future Tommy if you dont mind I will
take tea of a morning

All the same to me explained the agreeable Tommy its your
breakfast

What I was about to say continued Peter was that youre not looking
very well Tommy

Im all right asserted Tommy never nothing the matter with me

Not that you know of perhaps but one can be in a very bad way Tommy
without being aware of it I cannot have anyone about me that I am not
sure is in thoroughly sound health

If you mean youve changed your mind and want to get rid of me began
Tommy with its chin in the air

I dont want any of your uppishness snapped Peter who had wound
himself up for the occasion to a degree of assertiveness that surprised
even himself If you are a thoroughly strong and healthy person as I
think you are I shall be very glad to retain your services But upon
that point I must be satisfied It is the custom explained Peter It
is always done in good families Run round to this addressPeter wrote
it upon a leaf of his notebookand ask Dr Smith to come and see me
before he begins his round You go at once and dont let us have any
argument

That is the way to talk to that young personclearly said Peter to
himself listening to Tommys footsteps dying down the stairs

Hearing the streetdoor slam Peter stole into the kitchen and brewed
himself a cup of coffee

Dr Smith who had commenced life as Herr Schmidt but who in consequence
of difference of opinion with his Government was now an Englishman with
strong Tory prejudices had but one sorrow it was that strangers would
mistake him for a foreigner He was short and stout with bushy eyebrows
and a grey moustache and looked so fierce that children cried when they
saw him until he patted them on the head and addressed them as mein
leedle frent in a voice so soft and tender that they had to leave off
howling just to wonder where it came from He and Peter who was a
vehement Radical had been cronies for many years and had each an
indulgent contempt for the others understanding tempered by a sincere
affection for one another they would have found it difficult to account
for

What tink you is de matter wid de leedle wench demanded Dr Smith
Peter having opened the case Peter glanced round the room The kitchen
door was closed

How do you know its a wench

The eyes beneath the bushy brows grew rounder If id is not a wench
why dress it

Havent dressed it interrupted Peter Just what Im waiting to doso
soon as I know

And Peter recounted the events of the preceding evening

Tears gathered in the doctors small round eyes His absurd
sentimentalism was the quality in his friend that most irritated Peter

Poor leedle waif murmured the softhearted old gentleman Id was de
good Providence dat guided heror him whichever id be

Providence be hanged snarled Peter What was my Providence
doinglanding me with a gutterbrat to look after

So like you Radicals sneered the doctor to despise a fellow human
creature just because id may not have been born in burble and fine
linen

I didnt send for you to argue politics retorted Peter controlling
his indignation by an effort I want you to tell me whether its a boy
or a girl so that I may know what to do with it

What mean you to do wid id inquired the doctor

I dont know confessed Peter If its a boy as I rather think it
is maybe Ill be able to find it a place in one of the officesafter
Ive taught it a little civilisation

And if id be a girl

How can it be a girl when it wears trousers demanded Peter Why
anticipate difficulties

Peter alone paced to and fro the room his hands behind his back his
ear on the alert to catch the slightest sound from above

I do hope it is a boy said Peter glancing up

Peters eyes rested on the photo of the fragile little woman gazing down
at him from its stiff frame upon the chimneypiece Thirty years ago in
this same room Peter had paced to and fro his hands behind his back
his ear alert to catch the slightest sound from above had said to
himself the same words

Its odd mused Petervery odd indeed

The door opened The stout doctor preceded at a little distance by his
watchchain entered and closed the door behind him

A very healthy child said the doctor as fine a child as any one
could wish to see A girl

The two old gentlemen looked at one another Elizabeth possibly
relieved in her mind began to purr

What am I to do with it demanded Peter

A very awkward bosition for you agreed the sympathetic doctor

I was a fool declared Peter

You haf no one here to look after de leedle wench when you are away
pointed out the thoughtful doctor

And from what Ive seen of the imp added Peter it will want some
looking after

I tinkI tink said the helpful doctor I see a way out

What

The doctor thrust his fierce face forward and tapped knowingly with his
right forefinger the right side of his round nose I will take charge
of de leedle wench

You

To me de case will not present de same difficulties I haf a
housekeeper

Oh yes Mrs Whateley

She is a goot woman when you know her explained the doctor She only
wants managing

Pooh ejaculated Peter

Why do you say dat inquired the doctor

You bringing up a headstrong girl The idea

I should be kind but firm

You dont know her

How long haf you known her

Anyhow Im not a softhearted sentimentalist that would just ruin the
child

Girls are not boys persisted the doctor dey want different
treatment

Well Im not a brute snarled Peter Besides suppose she turns out
rubbish What do you know about her

I take my chance agreed the generous doctor

It wouldnt be fair retorted honest Peter

Tink it over said the doctor A place is never home widout de leedle
feet We Englishmen love de home You are different You haf no
sentiment

I cannot help feeling explained Peter a sense of duty in this
matter The child came to me It is as if this thing had been laid upon
me

If you look upon id dat way Peter sighed the doctor

With sentiment went on Peter I have nothing to do but dutyduty is
quite another thing Peter feeling himself an ancient Roman thanked
the doctor and shook hands with him

Tommy summoned appeared

The doctor Tommy said Peter without looking up from his writing
gives a very satisfactory account of you So you can stop

Told you so returned Tommy Might have saved your money

But we shall have to find you another name

What for

If you are to be a housekeeper you must be a girl

Dont like girls

Cant say I think much of them myself Tommy We must make the best of
it To begin with we must get you proper clothes

Hate skirts They hamper you

Tommy said Peter severely dont argue

Pointing out facts aint arguing argued Tommy They do hamper you
You try em

The clothes were quickly made and after a while they came to fit but
the name proved more difficult of adjustment A sweetfaced laughing
lady known to fame by a title respectable and orthodox appears an
honoured guest today at many a literary gathering But the old fellows
pressing round still call her Tommy

The weeks trial came to an end Peter whose digestion was delicate
had had a happy thought

What I propose TommyI mean Jane said Peter is that we should get
in a woman to do just the mere cooking That will give you more time
toto attend to other things TommyJane I mean

What other things chin in the air

Thethe keeping of the rooms in order Tommy Thethe dusting

Dont want twentyfour hours a day to dust four rooms

Then there are messages Tommy It would be a great advantage to me to
have someone I could send on a message without feeling I was interfering
with the housework

What are you driving at demanded Tommy Why I dont have half
enough to do as it is I can do all

Peter put his foot down When I say a thing I mean a thing The
sooner you understand that the better How dare you argue with me
Fiddlededee For two pins Peter would have employed an expletive even
stronger so determined was he feeling

Tommy without another word left the room Peter looked at Elizabeth and
winked

Poor Peter His triumph was shortlived Five minutes later Tommy
returned clad in the long black skirt supported by the cricket belt
the blue garibaldi cut _decollete_ the pepperandsalt jacket the
worsted comforter the red lips very tightly pressed the long lashes
over the black eyes moving very rapidly

Tommy severely what is this tomfoolery

I understand I aint no good to you Thanks for giving me a trial My
fault

Tommy less severely dont be an idiot

Aint an idiot Twas Emma Told me I was good at cooking Said Id
got an aptitude for it She meant well

Tommy no trace of severity sit down Emma was quite right Your
cooking isis promising As Emma puts it you have aptitude
Yourperseverance your hopefulness proves it

Then why dye want to get someone else in to do it

If Peter could have answered truthfully If Peter could have replied

My dear I am a lonely old gentleman I did not know it untiluntil
the other day Now I cannot forget it again Wife and child died many
years ago I was poor or I might have saved them That made me hard
The clock of my life stood still I hid away the key I did not want to
think You crept to me out of the cruel fog awakened old dreams Do
not go away any moreperhaps Tommy in spite of her fierce
independence would have consented to be useful and thus Peter might
have gained his end at less cost of indigestion But the penalty for
being an antisentimentalist is that you must not talk like this even to
yourself So Peter had to cast about for other methods

Why shouldnt I keep two servants if I like It did seem hard on the
old gentleman

Whats the sense of paying two to do the work of one You would only be
keeping me on out of charity The black eyes flashed I aint a
beggar

And you really think TommyI should say Jane you can manage thethe
whole of it You wont mind being sent on a message perhaps in the very
middle of your cooking It was that I was thinking of Tommysome cooks
would

You go easy advised him Tommy till I complain of having too much to
do

Peter returned to his desk Elizabeth looked up It seemed to Peter
that Elizabeth winked

The fortnight that followed was a period of trouble to Peter for Tommy
her suspicions having been aroused was sceptical of business demanding
that Peter should dine with this man at the club lunch with this editor
at the Cheshire Cheese At once the chin would go up into the air the
black eyes cloud threateningly Peter an unmarried man for thirty
years lacking experience would under crossexamination contradict
himself become confused break down over essential points

Really grumbled Peter to himself one evening sawing at a mutton chop
really theres no other word for itIm henpecked

Peter that day had looked forward to a little dinner at a favourite
restaurant with his dear old friend Blenkinsopp a bit of a gourmet
Tommythat means a man who likes what you would call elaborate
cookingforgetful at the moment that he had used up Blenkinsopp
three days before for a farewell supper Blenkinsopp having to set out
the next morning for Egypt Peter was not facile at invention Names in
particular had always been a difficulty to him

I like a spirit of independence continued Peter to himself Wish she
hadnt quite so much of it Wonder where she got it from

The situation was becoming more serious to Peter than he cared to admit
For day by day in spite of her tyrannies Tommy was growing more and
more indispensable to Peter Tommy was the first audience that for
thirty years had laughed at Peters jokes Tommy was the first public
that for thirty years had been convinced that Peter was the most
brilliant journalist in Fleet Street Tommy was the first anxiety that
for thirty years had rendered it needful that Peter each night should
mount stealthily the creaking stairs steal with shaded candle to a
bedside If only Tommy wouldnt do for him If only she could be
persuaded to do something else

Another happy thought occurred to Peter

TommyI mean Jane said Peter I know what Ill do with you

Whats the game now

Ill make a journalist of you

Dont talk rot

It isnt rot Besides I wont have you answer me like that As a
Devilthat means Tommy the unseen person in the background that helps
a journalist to do his workyou would be invaluable to me It would pay
me Tommypay me very handsomely I should make money out of you

This appeared to be an argument that Tommy understood Peter with
secret delight noticed that the chin retained its normal level

I did help a chap to sell papers once remembered Tommy he said I
was fly at it

I told you so exclaimed Peter triumphantly The methods are
different but the instinct required is the same We will get a woman in
to relieve you of the housework

The chin shot up into the air

I could do it in my spare time

You see Tommy I should want you to go about with meto be always with
me

Better try me first Maybe youre making an error

Peter was learning the wisdom of the serpent

Quite right Tommy We will first see what you can do Perhaps after
all it may turn out that you are better as a cook In his heart Peter
doubted this

But the seed had fallen upon good ground It was Tommy herself that
manoeuvred her first essay in journalism A great man had come to
Londonwas staying in apartments especially prepared for him in St
Jamess Palace Said every journalist in London to himself If I could
obtain an interview with this Big Man what a big thing it would be for
me For a week past Peter had carried everywhere about with him a
paper headed Interview of Our Special Correspondent with Prince Blank
questions down lefthand column very narrow space for answers right
hand side very wide But the Big Man was experienced

I wonder said Peter spreading the neatly folded paper on the desk
before him I wonder if there can be any way of getting at himany
dodge or trick any piece of low cunning any plausible lie that I
havent thought of

Old Man Martincalled himself Martiniwas just such another
commented Tommy Come pay time Saturday afternoon you just couldnt
get at himsimply wasnt any way I was a bit too good for him once
though remembered Tommy with a touch of pride in her voice got half
a quid out of him that time It did surprise him

No communed Peter to himself aloud I dont honestly think there can
be any method creditable or discreditable that I havent tried Peter
flung the onesided interview into the wastepaperbasket and slipping
his notebook into his pocket departed to drink tea with a lady novelist
whose great desire as stated in a postscript to her invitation was to
avoid publicity if possible

Tommy as soon as Peters back was turned fished it out again

An hour later in the fog around St Jamess Palace stood an Imp clad in
patched trousers and a pepperandsalt jacket turned up about the neck
gazing with admiring eyes upon the sentry

Now then young seventeenandsixpence the soot said the sentry
what do you want

Makes you a bit anxious dont it suggested the Imp having a big pot
like him to look after

Does get a bit on yer mind if yer thinks about it agreed the sentry

How do you find him to talk to like

Well said the sentry bringing his right leg into action for the
purpose of relieving his left aint ad much to do with im myself not
personly as yet Oh e aint a bad sort when yer know im

Thats his shakedown aint it asked the Imp where the lights are

Thats it admitted sentry You aint an Anarchist Tell me if you
are

Ill let you know if I feel it coming on the Imp assured him

Had the sentry been a man of swift and penetrating observationwhich he
wasnthe might have asked the question in more serious a tone For he
would have remarked that the Imps black eyes were resting lovingly upon
a rainwaterpipe giving to a skilful climber easy access to the terrace
underneath the Princes windows

I would like to see him said the Imp

Friend o yours asked the sentry

Well not exactly admitted the Imp But there you know everybodys
talking about him down our street

Well yerll ave to be quick about it said the sentry Es off to
night

Tommys face fell I thought it wasnt till Friday morning

Ah said the sentry thats what the papers say is it The sentrys
voice took unconsciously the accent of those from whom no secret is hid
Ill tell yer what yer can do continued the sentry enjoying an
unaccustomed sense of importance The sentry glanced left then right
Es a slipping off all by imself down to Osborne by the 640 from
Waterloo Nobody knows itcept o course just a few of us Thats
is way all over E just ates

A footstep sounded down the corridor The sentry became statuesque

At Waterloo Tommy inspected the 640 train Only one compartment
indicated possibilities an extra large one at the end of the coach next
the guards van It was labelled Reserved and in the place of the
usual fittings was furnished with a table and four easychairs Having
noticed its position Tommy took a walk up the platform and disappeared
into the fog

Twenty minutes later Prince Blank stepped hurriedly across the platform
unnoticed save by half a dozen obsequious officials and entered the
compartment reserved for him The obsequious officials bowed Prince
Blank in military fashion raised his hand The 640 steamed out
slowly

Prince Blank who was a stout gentleman though he tried to disguise the
fact seldom found himself alone When he did he generally indulged
himself in a little healthy relaxation With two hours run to
Southampton before him free from all possibility of intrusion Prince
Blank let loose the buttons of his powerfully built waistcoat rested his
bald head on the top of his chair stretched his great legs across
another and closed his terrible small eyes

For an instant it seemed to Prince Blank that a draught had entered into
the carriage As however the sensation immediately passed away he did
not trouble to wake up Then the Prince dreamed that somebody was in the
carriage with himwas sitting opposite to him This being an annoying
sort of dream the Prince opened his eyes for the purpose of dispelling
it There was somebody sitting opposite to hima very grimy little
person wiping blood off its face and hands with a dingy handkerchief
Had the Prince been a man capable of surprise he would have been
surprised

Its all right assured him Tommy I aint here to do any harm I
aint an Anarchist

The Prince by a muscular effort retired some four or five inches and
commenced to rebutton his waistcoat

How did you get here asked the Prince

Twas a bigger job than Id reckoned on admitted Tommy seeking a dry
inch in the smeared handkerchief and finding none But that dont
matter added Tommy cheerfully now Im here

If you do not wish me to hand you over to the police at Southampton you
had better answer my questions remarked the Prince drily

Tommy was not afraid of princes but in the lexicon of her harassed youth
Police had always been a word of dread

I wanted to get at you

I gather that

There didnt seem any other way Its jolly difficult to get at you
Youre so jolly artful

Tell me how you managed it

Theres a little bridge for signals just outside Waterloo I could see
that the train would have to pass under it So I climbed up and waited
It being a foggy night you see nobody twigged me I say you are
Prince Blank aint you

I am Prince Blank

Should have been mad if Id landed the wrong man

Go on

I knew which was your carriageleastways I guessed it and as it came
along I did a drop Tommy spread out her arms and legs to illustrate
the action The lamps you know explained Tommy still dabbing at her
faceone of them caught me

And from the roof

Oh well it was easy after that Theres an iron thing at the back
and steps Youve only got to walk downstairs and round the corner and
there you are Bit of luck your other door not being locked I hadnt
thought of that Havent got such a thing as a handkerchief about you
have you

The Prince drew one from his sleeve and passed it to her You mean to
tell me boy

Aint a boy explained Tommy Im a girl

She said it sadly Deeming her new friends such as could be trusted
Tommy had accepted their statement that she really was a girl But for
many a long year to come the thought of her lost manhood tinged her voice
with bitterness

A girl

Tommy nodded her head

Umph said the Prince I have heard a good deal about the English
girl I was beginning to think it exaggerated Stand up

Tommy obeyed It was not altogether her way but with those eyes beneath
their shaggy brows bent upon her it seemed the simplest thing to do

So And now that you are here what do you want

To interview you

Tommy drew forth her list of questions

The shaggy brows contracted

Who put you up to this absurdity Who was it Tell me at once

Nobody

Dont lie to me His name

The terrible small eyes flashed fire But Tommy also had a pair of
eyes Before their blaze of indignation the great man positively
quailed This type of opponent was new to him

Im not lying

I beg your pardon said the Prince

And at this point it occurred to the Prince who being really a great
man had naturally a sense of humour that a conference conducted on
these lines between the leading statesman of an Empire and an impertinent
hussy of say twelve years old at the outside might end by becoming
ridiculous So the Prince took up his chair and put it down again beside
Tommys and employing skilfully his undoubted diplomatic gifts drew
from her bit by bit the whole story

Im inclined Miss Jane said the Great Man the story ended to agree
with our friend Mr Hope I should say your _metier_ was journalism

And youll let me interview you asked Tommy showing her white teeth

The Great Man laying a hand heavier than he guessed on Tommys shoulder
rose I think you are entitled to it

Whats your views demanded Tommy reading of the future political
and social relationships

Perhaps suggested the Great Man it will be simpler if I write it
myself

Well concurred Tommy my spelling is a bit rocky

The Great Man drew a chair to the table

You wont miss out anythingwill you insisted Tommy

I shall endeavour Miss Jane to give you no cause for complaint
gravely he assured her and sat down to write

Not till the train began to slacken speed had the Prince finished Then
blotting and refolding the paper he stood up

I have added some instructions on the back of the last page explained
the Prince to which you will draw Mr Hopes particular attention I
would wish you to promise me Miss Jane never again to have recourse to
dangerous acrobatic tricks not even in the sacred cause of journalism

Of course if you hadnt been so jolly difficult to get at

My fault I know agreed the Prince There is not the least doubt as
to which sex you belong to Nevertheless I want you to promise me
Come urged the Prince I have done a good deal for youmore than you
know

All right consented Tommy a little sulkily Tommy hated making
promises because she always kept them I promise

There is your Interview The first Southampton platform lamp shone in
upon the Prince and Tommy as they stood facing one another The Prince
who had acquired the reputation not altogether unjustly of an
illtempered and savage old gentleman did a strange thing taking the
little bloodsmeared face between his paws he kissed it Tommy always
remembered the smoky flavour of the bristly grey moustache

One thing more said the Prince sternlynot a word of all this Dont
open your mouth to speak of it till you are back in Gough Square

Do you take me for a mug answered Tommy

They behaved very oddly to Tommy after the Prince had disappeared
Everybody took a deal of trouble for her but none of them seemed to know
why they were doing it They looked at her and went away and came again
and looked at her And the more they thought about it the more puzzled
they became Some of them asked her questions but what Tommy really
didnt know added to what she didnt mean to tell was so prodigious
that Curiosity itself paled at contemplation of it

They washed and brushed her up and gave her an excellent supper and
putting her into a firstclass compartment labelled Reserved sent her
back to Waterloo and thence in a cab to Gough Square where she arrived
about midnight suffering from a sense of selfimportance traces of
which to this day are still discernible

Such and thus was the beginning of all things Tommy having talked for
half an hour at the rate of two hundred words a minute had suddenly
dropped her head upon the table had been aroused with difficulty and
persuaded to go to bed Peter in the deep easychair before the fire
sat long into the night Elizabeth liking quiet company purred softly
Out of the shadows crept to Peter Hope an old forgotten dreamthe dream
of a wonderful new Journal price one penny weekly of which the Editor
should come to be one Thomas Hope son of Peter Hope its honoured
Founder and Originator a powerful Journal that should supply a longfelt
want popular but at the same time elevatinga pleasure to the public
a profit to its owners Do you not remember me whispered the Dream
We had long talks together The morning and the noonday pass The
evening still is ours The twilight also brings its promise

Elizabeth stopped purring and looked up surprised Peter was laughing to
himself




STORY THE SECONDWilliam Clodd appoints himself Managing Director


Mrs Postwhistle sat on a Windsorchair in the centre of Rolls Court
Mrs Postwhistle who in the days of her Hebehood had been likened by
admiring frequenters of the old Mitre in Chancery Lane to the ladies
somewhat emaciated that an English artist since become famous was then
commencing to popularise had developed with the passing years yet still
retained a face of placid youthfulness The two facts taken in
conjunction had resulted in an asset to her income not to be despised
The wanderer through Rolls Court this summers afternoon presuming him
to be familiar with current journalism would have retired haunted by the
sense that the restfullooking lady on the Windsorchair was someone that
he ought to know Glancing through almost any illustrated paper of the
period the problem would have been solved for him A photograph of Mrs
Postwhistle taken quite recently he would have encountered with this
legend _Before_ use of Professor Hardtops certain cure for
corpulency Beside it a photograph of Mrs Postwhistle then Arabella
Higgins taken twenty years ago the legend slightly varied _After_
use etc The face was the same the figurethere was no denying
ithad undergone decided alteration

Mrs Postwhistle had reached with her chair the centre of Rolls Court in
course of following the sun The little shop over the lintel of which
ran Timothy Postwhistle Grocer and Provision Merchant she had left
behind her in the shadow Old inhabitants of St DunstanintheWest
retained recollection of a gentlemanly figure always in a very gorgeous
waistcoat with Dundreary whiskers to be seen occasionally there behind
the counter All customers it would refer with the air of a Lord High
Chamberlain introducing _debutantes_ to Mrs Postwhistle evidently
regarding itself purely as ornamental For the last ten years however
no one had noticed it there and Mrs Postwhistle had a facility
amounting almost to genius for ignoring or misunderstanding questions it
was not to her taste to answer Most things were suspected nothing
known St DunstanintheWest had turned to other problems

If I wasnt wanting to see im remarked to herself Mrs Postwhistle
who was knitting with one eye upon the shop ed a been ere fore Id
ad time to clear the dinner things away certain to ave been Its a
strange world

Mrs Postwhistle was desirous for the arrival of a gentleman not usually
awaited with impatience by the ladies of Rolls Courtto wit one William
Clodd rentcollector whose day for St DunstanintheWest was Tuesday

At last said Mrs Postwhistle though without hope that Mr Clodd who
had just appeared at the other end of the court could possibly hear her
Was beginning to be afraid as youd tumbled over yerself in your urry
and urt yerself

Mr Clodd perceiving Mrs Postwhistle decided to abandon method and
take No 7 first

Mr Clodd was a short thickset bulletheaded young man with ways that
were bustling and eyes that though kind suggested trickiness

Ah said Mr Clodd admiringly as he pocketed the six halfcrowns that
the lady handed up to him If only they were all like you Mrs
Postwhistle

Wouldnt be no need of chaps like you to worry em pointed out Mrs
Postwhistle

Its an irony of fate my being a rentcollector when you come to think
of it remarked Mr Clodd writing out the receipt If I had my way
Id put an end to landlordism root and branch Curse of the country

Just the very thing I wanted to talk to you about returned the
ladythat lodger o mine

Ah dont pay dont he You just hand him over to me Ill soon have
it out of him

Its not that explained Mrs Postwhistle If a Saturday morning
appened to come round as e didnt pay up without me asking I should
know Id made a mistakethat it must be Friday If I dont appen to be
in at alfpast ten e puts it in an envelope and leaves it on the
table

Wonder if his mother has got any more like him mused Mr Clodd Could
do with a few about this neighbourhood What is it you want to say about
him then Merely to brag about him

I wanted to ask you continued Mrs Postwhistle ow I could get rid
of im It was rather a curious agreement

Why do you want to get rid of him Too noisy

Noisy Why the cat makes more noise about the ouse than e does Ed
make is fortune as a burglar

Come home late

Never known im out after the shutters are up

Gives you too much trouble then

I cant say that of im Never know whether es in the ouse or isnt
without going upstairs and knocking at the door

Here you tell it your own way suggested the bewildered Clodd If it
was anyone else but you I should say you didnt know your own business

E gets on my nerves said Mrs Postwhistle You aint in a urry for
five minutes

Mr Clodd was always in a hurry But I can forget it talking to you
added the gallant Mr Clodd

Mrs Postwhistle led the way into the little parlour

Just the name of it consented Mr Clodd Cheerfulness combined with
temperance thats the ideal

Ill tell you what appened only last night commenced Mrs
Postwhistle seating herself the opposite side of the lootable A
letter came for im by the seven oclock post Id seen im go out two
hours before and though Id been sitting in the shop the whole blessed
time I never saw or eard im pass through Es like that Its like
aving a ghost for a lodger I opened is door without knocking and went
in If youll believe me e was clinging with is arms and legs to the
top of the bedsteadits one of those oldfashioned fourpost
thingsis ead touching the ceiling E adnt got too much clothes
on and was cracking nuts with is teeth and eating em E threw a
andful of shells at me and making the most awful faces at me started
off gibbering softly to himself

All play I suppose No real vice commented the interested Mr Clodd

It will go on for a week that will continued Mrs Postwhistlee
fancying imself a monkey Last week he was a tortoise and was crawling
about on his stomach with a teatray tied on to is back Es as
sensible as most men if thats saying much the moment es outside the
front door but in the ousewell I suppose the fact is that es a
lunatic

Dont seem no hiding anything from you Mrs Postwhistle remarked Mr
Clodd in tones of admiration Does he ever get violent

Dont know what e would be like if e appened to fancy imself
something really dangerous answered Mrs Postwhistle I am a bit
nervous of this new monkey game I dont mind confessing to youthe
things that they do according to the picturebooks Up to now except
for imagining imself a mole and taking all his meals underneath the
carpet its been mostly birds and cats and armless sort o things I
avent seemed to mind so much

How did you get hold of him demanded Mr Clodd Have much trouble in
finding him or did somebody come and tell you about him

Old Gladman of Chancery Lane the law stationer brought im ere one
evening about two months agosaid e was a sort of distant relative of
is a bit soft in the ead but perfectly armlesswanted to put im
with someone who wouldnt impose on im Well what between aving been
empty for over five weeks the poor old gaby imself looking as gentle as
a lamb and the figure being reasonable I rather jumped at the idea and
old Gladman explaining as ow e wanted the thing settled and done with
got me to sign a letter

Kept a copy of it asked the businesslike Clodd

No But I can remember what it was Gladman ad it all ready So long
as the money was paid punctual and e didnt make no disturbance and
didnt fall sick I was to go on boarding and lodging im for seventeen
andsixpence a week It didnt strike me as anything to be objected to
at the time but e payin regular as Ive explained to you and
beaving so far as disturbance is concerned more like a Christian
martyr than a man well it looks to me as if Id got to live and die
with im

Give him rope and possibly hell have a week at being a howling hyaena
or a laughing jackass or something of that sort that will lead to a
disturbance thought Mr Clodd in which case of course you would
have your remedy

Yes thought Mrs Postwhistle and possibly also e may take it into
what e calls is ead to be a tiger or a bull and then perhaps before
es through with it Ill be beyond the reach of remedies

Leave it to me said Mr Clodd rising and searching for his hat I
know old Gladman Ill have a talk with him

You might get a look at that letter if you can suggested Mrs
Postwhistle and tell me what you think about it I dont want to spend
the rest of my days in a lunatic asylum of my own if I can elp it

You leave it to me was Mr Clodds parting assurance

The July moon had thrown a silver veil over the grimness of Rolls Court
when five hours later Mr Clodds nailed boots echoed again upon its
uneven pavement but Mr Clodd had no eye for moon or stars or suchlike
always he had things more important to think of

Seen the old umbug asked Mrs Postwhistle who was partial to the
air leading the way into the parlour

First and foremost commenced Mr Clodd as he laid aside his hat it
is quite understood that you really do want to get rid of him Whats
that demanded Mr Clodd a heavy thud upon the floor above having
caused him to start out of his chair

E came in an hour after youd gone explained Mrs Postwhistle
bringing with him a curtain pole as ed picked up for a shilling in
Clare Market Es rested one end upon the mantelpiece and tied the
other to the back of the easychairis idea is to twine imself round
it and go to sleep upon it Yes youve got it quite right without a
single blunder I do want to get rid of im

Then said Mr Clodd reseating himself it can be done

Thank God for that was Mrs Postwhistles pious ejaculation

It is just as I thought continued Mr Clodd The old innocenthes
Gladmans brotherinlaw by the wayhas got a small annuity I
couldnt get the actual figure but I guess its about sufficient to pay
for his keep and leave old Gladman who is running him a very decent
profit They dont want to send him to an asylum They cant say hes a
pauper and to put him into a private establishment would swallow up
most likely the whole of his income On the other hand they dont want
the bother of looking after him themselves I talked pretty straight to
the old manlet him see I understood the business andwell to cut a
long story short Im willing to take on the job provided you really
want to have done with it and Gladman is willing in that case to let you
off your contract

Mrs Postwhistle went to the cupboard to get Mr Clodd a drink Another
thud upon the floor aboveone suggestive of exceptional velocityarrived
at the precise moment when Mrs Postwhistle the tumbler level with her
eye was in the act of measuring

I call this making a disturbance said Mrs Postwhistle regarding the
broken fragments

Its only for another night comforted her Mr Clodd Ill take him
away some time tomorrow Meanwhile if I were you I should spread a
mattress underneath that perch of his before I went to bed I should
like him handed over to me in reasonable repair

It will deaden the sound a bit anyow agreed Mrs Postwhistle

Success to temperance drank Mr Clodd and rose to go

I take it youve fixed things up all right for yourself said Mrs
Postwhistle and nobody can blame you if you ave Eaven bless you is
what I say

We shall get on together prophesied Mr Clodd Im fond of animals

Early the next morning a fourwheeled cab drew up at the entrance to
Rolls Court and in it and upon it went away Clodd and Clodds Lunatic
as afterwards he came to be known together with all the belongings of
Clodds Lunatic the curtainpole included and there appeared again
behind the fanlight of the little grocers shop the intimation Lodgings
for a Single Man which caught the eye a few days later of a
weirdlooking lanky rawboned laddie whose language Mrs Postwhistle
found difficulty for a time in comprehending and that is why one
sometimes meets today worshippers of Kail Yard literature wandering
disconsolately about St DunstanintheWest seeking Rolls Court
discomforted because it is no more But that is the history of the Wee
Laddie and this of the beginnings of William Clodd now Sir William
Clodd Bart MP proprietor of a quarter of a hundred newspapers
magazines and journals Truthful Billy we called him then

No one can say of Clodd that he did not deserve whatever profit his
unlicensed lunatic asylum may have brought him A kindly man was William
Clodd when indulgence in sentiment did not interfere with business

Theres no harm in him asserted Mr Clodd talking the matter over
with one Mr Peter Hope journalist of Gough Square Hes just a bit
dotty same as you or I might get with nothing to do and all day long to
do it in Kids play thats all it is The best plan I find is to
treat it as a game and take a hand in it Last week he wanted to be a
lion I could see that was going to be awkward he roaring for raw meat
and thinking to prowl about the house at night Well I didnt nag
himthats no good I just got a gun and shot him Hes a duck now
and Im trying to keep him one sits for an hour beside his bath on three
china eggs Ive bought him Wish some of the sane ones were as little
trouble

The summer came again Clodd and his Lunatic a mildlooking little old
gentleman of somewhat clerical cut one often met with arminarm
bustling about the streets and courts that were the scene of Clodds rent
collecting labours Their evident attachment to one another was
curiously displayed Clodd the young and redhaired treating his white
haired withered companion with fatherly indulgence the other glancing
up from time to time into Clodds face with a winning expression of
infantile affection

We are getting much better explained Clodd the pair meeting Peter
Hope one day at the corner of Newcastle Street The more we are out in
the open air and the more we have to do and think about the better for
useh

The mildlooking little old gentleman hanging on Clodds arm smiled and
nodded

Between ourselves added Mr Clodd sinking his voice we are not half
as foolish as folks think we are

Peter Hope went his way down the Strand

Clodds a good sorta good sort said Peter Hope who having in his
time lived much alone had fallen into the habit of speaking his thoughts
aloud but hes not the man to waste his time I wonder

With the winter Clodds Lunatic fell ill

Clodd bustled round to Chancery Lane

To tell you the truth confessed Mr Gladman we never thought he
would live so long as he has

Theres the annuity youve got to think of said Clodd whom his
admirers of today and they are many for he must be a millionaire by
this time are fond of alluding to as that frank outspoken Englishman
Wouldnt it be worth your while to try what taking him away from the
fogs might do for him

Old Gladman seemed inclined to consider the question but Mrs Gladman a
brisk cheerful little woman had made up her mind

Weve had what there is to have said Mrs Gladman Hes
seventythree Whats the sense of risking good money Be content

No one could sayno one ever did saythat Clodd under the
circumstances did not do his best Perhaps after all nothing could
have helped The little old gentleman at Clodds suggestion played at
being a dormouse and lay very still If he grew restless thereby
bringing on his cough Clodd as a terrible black cat was watching to
pounce upon him Only by keeping very quiet and artfully pretending to
be asleep could he hope to escape the ruthless Clodd

Doctor William Smith ne Wilhelm Schmidt shrugged his fat shoulders We
can do noding Dese fogs of ours id is de one ting dat enables the
foreigner to crow over us Keep him quiet De dormouseid is a goot
idea

That evening William Clodd mounted to the second floor of 16 Gough
Square where dwelt his friend Peter Hope and knocked briskly at the
door

Come in said a decided voice which was not Peter Hopes

Mr William Clodds ambition was and always had been to be the owner or
partowner of a paper Today as I have said he owns a quarter of a
hundred and is in negotiation so rumour goes for seven more But
twenty years ago Clodd and Co Limited was but in embryo And Peter
Hope journalist had likewise and for many a long year cherished the
ambition to be before he died the owner or partowner of a paper Peter
Hope today owns nothing except perhaps the knowledge if such things be
permitted that whenever and wherever his name is mentioned kind
thoughts arise unbiddenthat someone of the party will surely say Dear
old Peter What a good fellow he was Which also may be in its way a
valuable possession who knows But twenty years ago Peters horizon was
limited by Fleet Street

Peter Hope was fortyseven so he said a dreamer and a scholar William
Clodd was threeandtwenty a born hustler very wide awake Meeting one
day by accident upon an omnibus when Clodd lent Peter who had come out
without his purse threepence to pay his fare with drifting into
acquaintanceship each had come to acquire a liking and respect for the
other The dreamer thought with wonder of Clodds shrewd practicability
the cute young man of business was lost in admiration of what seemed to
him his old friends marvellous learning Both had arrived at the
conclusion that a weekly journal with Peter Hope as editor and William
Clodd as manager would be bound to be successful

If only we could scrape together a thousand pounds had sighed Peter

The moment we lay our hands upon the coin well start that paper
Remember its a bargain had answered William Clodd

Mr William Clodd turned the handle and walked in With the door still
in his hand he paused to look round the room It was the first time he
had seen it His meetings hitherto with Peter Hope had been chance
_rencontres_ in street or restaurant Always had he been curious to view
the sanctuary of so much erudition

A large oakpanelled room its three high windows each with a low
cushioned seat beneath it giving on to Gough Square Thirtyfive years
before Peter Hope then a young dandy with side whiskers closecropped
and terminating just below the ear with wavy brown hair giving to his
freshcomplexioned face an appearance almost girlish in cutaway blue
coat flowered waistcoat black silk cravat secured by two gold pins
chained together and tightly strapped grey trouserings had aided and
abetted by a fragile little lady in crinoline and muchflounced skirt
and bodice somewhat low with corkscrew curls each movement of her head
set ringing planned and furnished it in accordance with the sober canons
then in vogue spending thereupon more than they should as is to be
expected from the young to whom the future promises all things The fine
Brussels carpet A little too bright had thought the shaking curls
The colours will tone down missmaam The shopman knew Only by
the help of the round island underneath the massive Empire table by
excursions into untrodden corners could Peter recollect the rainbow
floor his feet had pressed when he was twentyone The noble bookcase
surmounted by Minervas bust Really it was too expensive But the
nodding curls had been so obstinate Peters silly books and papers must
be put away in order the curls did not intend to permit any excuse for
untidiness So too the handsome brassbound desk it must be worthy
of the beautiful thoughts Peter would pen upon it The great sideboard
supported by two such angrylooking mahogany lions it must be strong to
support the weight of silver clever Peter would one day purchase to place
upon it The few oil paintings in their heavy frames A solidly
furnished sober apartment about it that subtle atmosphere of dignity
one finds but in old rooms long undisturbed where one seems to read upon
the walls I Joy and Sorrow twain in one have dwelt here One item
only there was that seemed out of place among its grave surroundingsa
guitar hanging from the wall ornamented with a ridiculous blue bow
somewhat faded

Mr William Clodd demanded the decided voice

Clodd started and closed the door

Guessed it in once admitted Mr Clodd

I thought so said the decided voice We got your note this
afternoon Mr Hope will be back at eight Will you kindly hang up your
hat and coat in the hall You will find a box of cigars on the
mantelpiece Excuse my being busy I must finish this then Ill talk
to you

The owner of the decided voice went on writing Clodd having done as he
was bid sat himself in the easychair before the fire and smoked Of
the person behind the desk Mr Clodd could see but the head and
shoulders It had black curly hair cut short Its only garment
visible below the white collar and red tie might have been a boys jacket
designed more like a girls or a girls designed more like a boys
partaking of the genius of English statesmanship it appeared to be a
compromise Mr Clodd remarked the long drooping lashes over the
bright black eyes

Its a girl said Mr Clodd to himself rather a pretty girl

Mr Clodd continuing downward arrived at the nose

No said Mr Clodd to himself its a boya cheeky young beggar I
should say

The person at the desk giving a grunt of satisfaction gathered together
sheets of manuscript and arranged them then resting its elbows on the
desk and taking its head between its hands regarded Mr Clodd

Dont you hurry yourself said Mr Clodd but when you really have
finished tell me what you think of me

I beg your pardon apologised the person at the desk I have got into
a habit of staring at people I know its rude Im trying to break
myself of it

Tell me your name suggested Mr Clodd and Ill forgive you

Tommy was the answerI mean Jane

Make up your mind advised Mr Clodd dont let me influence you I
only want the truth

You see explained the person at the desk everybody calls me Tommy
because that used to be my name But now its Jane

I see said Mr Clodd And which am I to call you

The person at the desk pondered Well if this scheme you and Mr Hope
have been talking about really comes to anything we shall be a good deal
thrown together you see and then I expect youll call me Tommymost
people do

Youve heard about the scheme Mr Hope has told you

Why of course replied Tommy Im Mr Hopes devil

For the moment Clodd doubted whether his old friend had not started a
rival establishment to his own

I help him in his work Tommy relieved his mind by explaining In
journalistic circles we call it devilling

I understand said Mr Clodd And what do you think Tommy of the
scheme I may as well start calling you Tommy because between you and
me I think the idea will come to something

Tommy fixed her black eyes upon him She seemed to be looking him right
through

You are staring again Tommy Clodd reminded her Youll have trouble
breaking yourself of that habit I can see

I was trying to make up my mind about you Everything depends upon the
business man

Glad to hear you say so replied the selfsatisfied Clodd

If you are very cleverDo you mind coming nearer to the lamp I cant
quite see you over there

Clodd never could understand why he did itnever could understand why
from first to last he always did what Tommy wished him to do his only
consolation being that other folks seemed just as helpless He rose and
crossing the long room stood at attention before the large desk
nervousness to which he was somewhat of a stranger taking possession of
him

You dont _look_ very clever

Clodd experienced another new sensationthat of falling in his own
estimation

And yet one can see that you _are_ clever

The mercury of Clodds conceit shot upward to a point that in the case of
anyone less physically robust might have been dangerous to health

Clodd held out his hand Well pull it through Tommy The Guvnor
shall find the literature you and I will make it go I like you

And Peter Hope entering at the moment caught a spark from the light
that shone in the eyes of William Clodd and Tommy whose other name was
Jane as gripping hands they stood with the desk between them laughing
they knew not why And the years fell from old Peter and again a boy
he also laughed he knew not why He had sipped from the winecup of
youth

Its all settled Guvnor cried Clodd Tommy and I have fixed things
up Well start with the New Year

Youve got the money

Im reckoning on it I dont see very well how I can miss it

Sufficient

Just about You get to work

Ive saved a little began Peter It ought to have been more but
somehow it isnt

Perhaps we shall want it Clodd replied perhaps we shant You are
supplying the brains

The three for a few moments remained silent

I think Tommy said Peter I think a bottle of the old Madeira

Not tonight said Clodd next time

To drink success urged Peter

One mans success generally means some other poor devils misfortune
answered Clodd

Cant be helped of course but dont want to think about it tonight
Must be getting back to my dormouse Good night

Clodd shook hands and bustled out

I thought as much mused Peter aloud

What an odd mixture the man is Kindno one could have been kinder to
the poor old fellow Yet all the whileWe are an odd mixture Tommy
said Peter Hope an odd mixture we men and women Peter was a
philosopher

The whitewhiskered old dormouse soon coughed himself to sleep for ever

I shall want you and the missis to come to the funeral Gladman said
Mr Clodd as he swung into the stationers shop and bring Pincer with
you Im writing to him

Dont see what good we can do demurred Gladman

Well you three are his only relatives its only decent you should be
present urged Clodd Besides theres the will to be read You may
care to hear it

The dry old law stationer opened wide his watery eyes

His will Why what had he got to leave There was nothing but the
annuity

You turn up at the funeral Clodd told him and youll learn all about
it Bonners clerk will be there and will bring it with him Everything
is going to be done _comme il faut_ as the French say

I ought to have known of this began Mr Gladman

Glad to find you taking so much interest in the old chap said Clodd
Pity hes dead and cant thank you

I warn you shouted old Gladman whose voice was rising to a scream
he was a helpless imbecile incapable of acting for himself If any
undue influence

See you on Friday broke in Clodd who was busy

Fridays ceremony was not a sociable affair Mrs Gladman spoke
occasionally in a shrill whisper to Mr Gladman who replied with grunts
Both employed the remainder of their time in scowling at Clodd Mr
Pincer a stout heavy gentleman connected with the House of Commons
maintained a ministerial reserve The undertakers foreman expressed
himself as thankful when it was over He criticised it as the humpiest
funeral he had ever known for a time he had serious thoughts of changing
his profession

The solicitors clerk was waiting for the party on its return from Kensal
Green Clodd again offered hospitality Mr Pincer this time allowed
himself a glass of weak whiskyandwater and sipped it with an air of
doing so without prejudice The clerk had one a little stronger Mrs
Gladman dispensing with consultation declined shrilly for self and
partner Clodd explaining that he always followed legal precedent
mixed himself one also and drank To our next happy meeting Then the
clerk read

It was a short and simple will dated the previous August It appeared
that the old gentleman unknown to his relatives had died possessed of
shares in a silver mine once despaired of now prospering Taking them
at present value they would produce a sum well over two thousand pounds
The old gentleman had bequeathed five hundred pounds to his brotherin
law Mr Gladman five hundred pounds to his only other living relative
his first cousin Mr Pincer the residue to his friend William Clodd
as a return for the many kindnesses that gentleman had shown him

Mr Gladman rose more amused than angry

And you think you are going to pocket that one thousand to twelve
hundred pounds You really do he asked Mr Clodd who with legs
stretched out before him sat with his hands deep in his trousers
pockets

Thats the idea admitted Mr Clodd

Mr Gladman laughed but without much lightening the atmosphere Upon
my word Clodd you amuse meyou quite amuse me repeated Mr Gladman

You always had a sense of humour commented Mr Clodd

You villain You doubledyed villain screamed Mr Gladman suddenly
changing his tone You think the law is going to allow you to swindle
honest men You think we are going to sit still for you to rob us That
will Mr Gladman pointed a lank forefinger dramatically towards the
table

You mean to dispute it inquired Mr Clodd

For a moment Mr Gladman stood aghast at the others coolness but soon
found his voice again

Dispute it he shrieked Do you dispute that you influenced
himdictated it to him word for word made the poor old helpless idiot
sign it he utterly incapable of even understanding

Dont chatter so much interrupted Mr Clodd Its not a pretty
voice yours What I asked you was do you intend to dispute it

If you will kindly excuse us struck in Mrs Gladman addressing Mr
Clodd with an air of much politeness we shall just have time if we go
now to catch our solicitor before he leaves his office

Mr Gladman took up his hat from underneath his chair

One moment suggested Mr Clodd I did influence him to make that
will If you dont like it theres an end of it

Of course commenced Mr Gladman in a mollified tone

Sit down suggested Mr Clodd Lets try another one Mr Clodd
turned to the clerk The previous one Mr Wright if you please the
one dated June the 10th

An equally short and simple document it bequeathed three hundred pounds
to Mr William Clodd in acknowledgment of kindnesses received the
residue to the Royal Zoological Society of London the deceased having
been always interested in and fond of animals The relatives Who have
never shown me the slightest affection or given themselves the slightest
trouble concerning me and who have already received considerable sums
out of my income being by name excluded

I may mention observed Mr Clodd no one else appearing inclined to
break the silence that in suggesting the Royal Zoological Society to my
poor old friend as a fitting object for his benevolence I had in mind a
very similar case that occurred five years ago A bequest to them was
disputed on the grounds that the testator was of unsound mind They had
to take their case to the House of Lords before they finally won it

Anyhow remarked Mr Gladman licking his lips which were dry you
wont get anything Mr Cloddno not even your threehundred pounds
clever as you think yourself My brotherinlaws money will go to the
lawyers

Then Mr Pincer rose and spoke slowly and clearly If there must be a
lunatic connected with our family which I dont see why there should be
it seems to me to be you Nathaniel Gladman

Mr Gladman stared back with open mouth Mr Pincer went on
impressively

As for my poor old cousin Joe he had his eccentricities but that was
all I for one am prepared to swear that he was of sound mind in August
last and quite capable of making his own will It seems to me that the
other thing dated in June is just waste paper

Mr Pincer having delivered himself sat down again Mr Gladman showed
signs of returning language

Oh whats the use of quarrelling chirped in cheery Mrs Gladman
Its five hundred pounds we never expected Live and let live is what I
always say

Its the damned artfulness of the thing said Mr Gladman still very
white about the gills

Oh you have a little something to thaw your face suggested his wife

Mr and Mrs Gladman on the strength of the five hundred pounds went
home in a cab Mr Pincer stayed behind and made a night of it with Mr
Clodd and Bonners clerk at Clodds expense

The residue worked out at eleven hundred and sixtynine pounds and a few
shillings The capital of the new company established for the purpose
of carrying on the business of newspaper publishers and distributors
printers advertising agents and any other trade and enterprise
affiliated to the same was one thousand pounds in one pound shares
fully paid up of which William Clodd Esquire was registered proprietor
of four hundred and sixtythree Peter Hope MA of 16 Gough Square
of also four hundred and sixtythree Miss Jane Hope adopted daughter of
said Peter Hope her real name nobody herself included ever having
known and generally called Tommy of three paid for by herself after a
battle royal with William Clodd Mrs Postwhistle of Rolls Court of

of ten still owing for Dr Smith ne Schmidt of fifty James Douglas
Alexander Calder McTear otherwise the Wee Laddie residing then in
Mrs Postwhistles first floor front of one paid for by poem published
in the first number The Song of the Pen

Choosing a title for the paper cost much thought Driven to despair
they called it _Good Humour_




STORY THE THIRDGrindley Junior drops into the Position of Publisher


Few are the ways of the West Central district that have changed less
within the last halfcentury than Nevills Court leading from Great New
Street into Fetter Lane Its north side still consists of the same
quaint row of small low shops that stood theredoing perhaps a little
brisker businesswhen George the Fourth was King its southern side of
the same three substantial houses each behind a strip of garden pleasant
by contrast with surrounding grimness built long agosome say before
Queen Anne was dead

Out of the largest of these passing through the garden then well cared
for came one sunny Sunday morning some fifteen years before the
commencement proper of this story one Solomon Appleyard pushing in
front of him a perambulator At the brick wall surmounted by wooden
railings that divides the garden from the court Solomon paused hearing
behind him the voice of Mrs Appleyard speaking from the doorstep

If I dont see you again until dinnertime Ill try and get on without
you understand Dont think of nothing but your pipe and forget the
child And be careful of the crossings

Mrs Appleyard retired into the darkness Solomon steering the
perambulator carefully emerged from Nevills Court without accident The
quiet streets drew Solomon westward A vacant seat beneath the shade
overlooking the Long Water in Kensington Gardens invited to rest

Piper suggested a small boy to Solomon _Sunday Times_ _Server_

My boy said Mr Appleyard speaking slowly when youve been mewed up
with newspapers eighteen hours a day for six days a week you can do
without em for a morning Take em away I want to forget the smell of
em

Solomon having assured himself that the party in the perambulator was
still breathing crossed his legs and lit his pipe

Hezekiah

The exclamation had been wrung from Solomon Appleyard by the approach of
a stout short man clad in a remarkably illfitting broadcloth suit

What Sol my boy

It looked like you said Solomon And then I said to myself No
surely it cant be Hezekiah hell be at chapel

You run about said Hezekiah addressing a youth of some four summers
he had been leading by the hand Dont you go out of my sight and
whatever you do dont you do injury to those new clothes of yours or
youll wish youd never been put into them The truth is continued
Hezekiah to his friend his sole surviving son and heir being out of
earshot the morning tempted me Taint often I get a bit of fresh
air

Doing well

The business replied Hezekiah is going up by leaps and boundsleaps
and bounds But of course all that means harder work for me Its
from six in the morning till twelve oclock at night

Theres nothing I know of returned Solomon who was something of a
pessimist thats given away free gratis for nothing except misfortune

Keeping yourself up to the mark aint too easy continued Hezekiah
and when it comes to other folks plays all they think of Talk
religion to themwhy they laugh at you What the worlds coming to I
dont know Hows the printing business doing

The printing business responded the other removing his pipe and
speaking somewhat sadly the printing business looks like being a big
thing Capital of course is what hampers meor rather the want of
it But Janet shes careful she dont waste much Janet dont

Now with Anne replied Hezekiah its all the other waypleasure
gaiety a day at Rosherville or the Crystal Palaceanything to waste
money

Ah she was always fond of her bit of fun remembered Solomon

Fun retorted Hezekiah I like a bit of fun myself But not if
youve got to pay for it Wheres the fun in that

What I ask myself sometimes said Solomon looking straight in front of
him is what do we do it for

What do we do what for

Work like blessed slaves depriving ourselves of all enjoyments Whats
the sense of it What

A voice from the perambulator beside him broke the thread of Solomon
Appleyards discourse The sole surviving son of Hezekiah Grindley
seeking distraction and finding none had crept back unperceived A
perambulator A thing his experience told him out of which excitement in
some form or another could generally be obtained You worried it and
took your chance Either it howled in which case you had to run for
your life followedand unfortunately overtaken nine times out of
tenby a whirlwind of vengeance or it gurgled in which case the
heavens smiled and halos descended on your head In either event you
escaped the deadly ennui that is the result of continuous virtue Master
Grindley his star having pointed out to him a peacocks feather lying on
the ground had with one eye upon his unobservant parent removed the
complicated coverings sheltering Miss Helvetia Appleyard from the world
and anticipating by a quarter of a century the prime enjoyment of British
youth had set to work to tickle that lady on the nose Miss Helvetia
Appleyard awakened did precisely what the tickled British maiden of to
day may be relied upon to do under corresponding circumstances she first
of all took swift and comprehensive survey of the male thing behind the
feather Had he been displeasing in her eyes she would one may rely
upon it have anteceded the behaviour in similar case of her descendant
of todaythat is to say have expressed resentment in no uncertain
terms Master Nathaniel Grindley proving however to her taste that
which might have been considered impertinence became accepted as a fit
and proper form of introduction Miss Appleyard smiled graciouslynay
further intimated desire for more

That your only one asked the paternal Grindley

Shes the only one replied Solomon speaking in tones less
pessimistic

Miss Appleyard had with the help of Grindley junior wriggled herself into
a sitting posture Grindley junior continued his attentions the lady
indicating by signs the various points at which she was most susceptible

Pretty picture they make together eh suggested Hezekiah in a whisper
to his friend

Never saw her take to anyone like that before returned Solomon
likewise in a whisper

A neighbouring church clock chimed twelve Solomon Appleyard knocking
the ashes from his pipe arose

Dont know any reason myself why we shouldnt see a little more of one
another than we do suggested Grindley senior shaking hands

Give us a lookup one Sunday afternoon suggested Solomon Bring the
youngster with you

Solomon Appleyard and Hezekiah Grindley had started life within a few
months of one another some fiveandthirty years before Likewise within
a few hundred yards of one another Solomon at his fathers bookselling
and printing establishment on the east side of the High Street of a small
Yorkshire town Hezekiah at his fathers grocery shop upon the west side
opposite Both had married farmers daughters Solomons natural bent
towards gaiety Fate had corrected by directing his affections to a
partner instinct with Yorkshire shrewdness and with shrewdness go other
qualities that make for success rather than for happiness Hezekiah had
circumstances been equal might have been his friends rival for Janets
capable and saving hand had not sweettempered laughing Annie
Glossopdirected by Providence to her moral welfare one must
presumefallen in love with him Between Janes virtues and Annies
three hundred golden sovereigns Hezekiah had not hesitated a moment
Golden sovereigns were solid facts wifely virtues by a seriousminded
and strongwilled husband could be instilledat all events
lightheartedness suppressed The two men Hezekiah urged by his own
ambition Solomon by his wifes had arrived in London within a year of
one another Hezekiah to open a grocers shop in Kensington which those
who should have known assured him was a hopeless neighbourhood But
Hezekiah had the instinct of the moneymaker Solomon after looking
about him had fixed upon the roomy substantial house in Nevills Court
as a promising foundation for a printers business

That was ten years ago The two friends scorning delights living
laborious days had seen but little of one another Lighthearted Annie
had borne to her dour partner two children who had died Nathaniel
George with the luck supposed to wait on number three had lived on
and inheriting fortunately the temperament of his mother had brought
sunshine into the gloomy rooms above the shop in High Street Kensington
Mrs Grindley grown weak and fretful had rested from her labours

Mrs Appleyards guardian angel prudent like his protege had waited
till Solomons business was well established before despatching the stork
to Nevills Court with a little girl Later had sent a boy who not
finding the close air of St Dunstan to his liking had found his way
back again thus passing out of this story and all others And there
remained to carry on the legend of the Grindleys and the Appleyards only
Nathaniel George now aged five and Janet Helvetia quite a beginner
who took lift seriously

There are no such things as facts Narrowminded folksurveyors
auctioneers and such likewould have insisted that the garden between
the old Georgian house and Nevills Court was a strip of land one hundred
and eighteen feet by ninetytwo containing a laburnum tree six laurel
bushes and a dwarf deodora To Nathaniel George and Janet Helvetia it
was the land of Thule the furthest boundaries of which no man has
reached On rainy Sunday afternoons they played in the great gloomy
pressroom where silent ogres standing motionless stretched out iron
arms to seize them as they ran Then just when Nathaniel George was
eight and Janet Helvetia four and a half Hezekiah launched the
celebrated Grindleys Sauce It added a relish to chops and steaks
transformed cold mutton into a luxury and swelled the head of Hezekiah
Grindleywhich was big enough in all conscience as it wasand
shrivelled up his little hard heart The Grindleys and the Appleyards
visited no more As a sensible fellow ought to have seen for himself so
thought Hezekiah the Sauce had altered all things The possibility of a
marriage between their children things having remained equal might have
been a pretty fancy but the son of the great Grindley whose name in
threefoot letters faced the world from every hoarding would have to
look higher than a printers daughter Solomon a sudden and vehement
convert to the principles of mediaeval feudalism would rather see his
only child granddaughter of the author of _The History of Kettlewell_
and other works dead and buried than married to a grocers son even
though he might inherit a fortune made out of poisoning the public with a
mixture of mustard and sour beer It was many years before Nathaniel
George and Janet Helvetia met one another again and when they did they
had forgotten one another

    

Hezekiah S Grindley a short stout and pompous gentleman sat under a
palm in the gorgeously furnished drawingroom of his big house at Notting
Hill Mrs Grindley a thin faded woman the despair of her dressmaker
sat as near to the fire as its massive and imposing copper outworks would
permit and shivered Grindley junior a fairhaired wellshaped youth
with eyes that the other sex found attractive leant with his hands in
his pockets against a scrupulously robed statue of Diana and appeared
uncomfortable

Im making the moneymaking it hand over fist All youll have to do
will be to spend it Grindley senior was explaining to his son and heir

Ill do that all right dad

Im not so sure of it was his fathers opinion Youve got to prove
yourself worthy to spend it Dont you think I shall be content to have
slaved all these years merely to provide a brainless young idiot with the
means of selfindulgence I leave my money to somebody worthy of me
Understand sirsomebody worthy of me

Mrs Grindley commenced a sentence Mr Grindley turned his small eyes
upon her The sentence remained unfinished

You were about to say something her husband reminded her

Mrs Grindley said it was nothing

If it is anything worth hearingif it is anything that will assist the
discussion lets have it Mr Grindley waited If not if you
yourself do not consider it worth finishing why have begun it

Mr Grindley returned to his son and heir You havent done too well at
schoolin fact your school career has disappointed me

I know Im not clever Grindley junior offered as an excuse

Why not Why arent you clever

His son and heir was unable to explain

You are my sonwhy arent you clever Its laziness sir sheer
laziness

Ill try and do better at Oxford sirhonour bright I will

You had better advised him his father because I warn you your whole
future depends upon it You know me Youve got to be a credit to me
to be worthy of the name of Grindleyor the name my boy is all youll
have

Old Grindley meant it and his son knew that he meant it The old
Puritan principles and instincts were strong in the old gentlemanformed
perhaps the better part of him Idleness was an abomination to him
devotion to pleasure other than the pleasure of moneymaking a grievous
sin in his eyes Grindley junior fully intended to do well at Oxford
and might have succeeded In accusing himself of lack of cleverness he
did himself an injustice He had brains he had energy he had
character Our virtues can be our stumblingblocks as well as our vices
Young Grindley had one admirable virtue that needs above all others
careful controlling he was amiability itself Before the charm and
sweetness of it Oxford snobbishness went down The Sauce against the
earnest counsel of its own advertisement was forgotten the pickles
passed by To escape the natural result of his popularity would have
needed a stronger will than young Grindley possessed For a time the
true state of affairs was hidden from the eye of Grindley senior To
slack it this term with the full determination of swotting it the
next is always easy the difficulty beginning only with the new term
Possibly with luck young Grindley might have retrieved his position and
covered up the traces of his folly but for an unfortunate accident
Returning to college with some other choice spirits at two oclock in the
morning it occurred to young Grindley that trouble might be saved all
round by cutting out a pane of glass with a diamond ring and entering his
rooms which were on the groundfloor by the window That in mistake
for his own he should have selected the bedroom of the College Rector
was a misfortune that might have occurred to anyone who had commenced the
evening on champagne and finished it on whisky Young Grindley having
been warned already twice before was sent down And then of course
the whole history of the three wasted years came out Old Grindley in
his study chair having talked for half an hour at the top of his voice
chose partly by reason of physical necessity partly by reason of
dormant dramatic instinct to speak quietly and slowly

Ill give you one chance more my boy and one only Ive tried you as
a gentlemanperhaps that was my mistake Now Ill try you as a grocer

As a what

As a grocer sirgrocergrocer a man who stands behind a counter
in a white apron and his shirtsleeves who sells tea and sugar and
candied peel and suchlike things to customersold ladies little girls
who rises at six in the morning takes down the shutters sweeps out the
shop cleans the windows who has half an hour for his dinner of corned
beef and bread who puts up the shutters at ten oclock at night tidies
up the shop has his supper and goes to bed feeling his day has not
been wasted I meant to spare you I was wrong You shall go through
the mill as I went through it If at the end of two years youve done
well with your time learned somethinglearned to be a man at all
eventsyou can come to me and thank me

Im afraid sir suggested Grindley junior whose handsome face during
the last few minutes had grown very white I might not make a very
satisfactory grocer You see sir Ive had no experience

I am glad you have some sense returned his father drily You are
quite right Even a grocers business requires learning It will cost
me a little money but it will be the last I shall ever spend upon you
For the first year you will have to be apprenticed and I shall allow you
something to live on It shall be more than I had at your agewell say
a pound a week After that I shall expect you to keep yourself

Grindley senior rose You need not give me your answer till the
evening You are of age I have no control over you unless you are
willing to agree You can go my way or you can go your own

Young Grindley who had inherited a good deal of his fathers grit felt
very much inclined to go his own but hampered on the other hand by the
sweetness of disposition he had inherited from his mother was unable to
withstand the argument of that ladys tears so that evening accepted old
Grindleys terms asking only as a favour that the scene of his probation
might be in some outoftheway neighbourhood where there would be little
chance of his being met by old friends

I have thought of all that answered his father My object isnt to
humiliate you more than is necessary for your good The shop I have
already selected on the assumption that you would submit is as quiet
and outoftheway as you could wish It is in a turning off Fetter
Lane where youll see few other people than printers and caretakers
Youll lodge with a woman a Mrs Postwhistle who seems a very sensible
person Shell board you and lodge you and every Saturday youll
receive a postoffice order for six shillings out of which youll find
yourself in clothes You can take with you sufficient to last you for
the first six months but no more At the end of the year you can change
if you like and go to another shop or make your own arrangements with
Mrs Postwhistle If all is settled you go there tomorrow You go out
of this house tomorrow in any event

Mrs Postwhistle was a large placid lady of philosophic temperament
Hitherto the little grocers shop in Rolls Court Fetter Lane had been
easy of management by her own unaided efforts but the neighbourhood was
rapidly changing Other grocers shops were disappearing one by one
making way for huge blocks of buildings where hundreds of iron presses
singing day and night spread to the earth the song of the Mighty Pen
There were hours when the little shop could hardly accommodate its crowd
of customers Mrs Postwhistle of a bulk not to be moved quickly had
after mature consideration conquering a natural disinclination to
change decided to seek assistance

Young Grindley alighting from a fourwheeled cab in Fetter Lane marched
up the court followed by a weakkneed wastrel staggering under the
weight of a small box In the doorway of the little shop young Grindley
paused and raised his hat

Mrs Postwhistle

The lady from her chair behind the counter rose slowly

I am Mr Nathaniel Grindley the new assistant

The weakkneed wastrel let fall the box with a thud upon the floor Mrs
Postwhistle looked her new assistant up and down

Oh said Mrs Postwhistle Well I shouldnt ave felt instinctively
it must be you not if Id ad to pick you out of a crowd But if you
tell me so why I suppose you are Come in

The weakkneed wastrel receiving to his astonishment a shilling
departed

Grindley senior had selected wisely Mrs Postwhistles theory was that
although very few people in this world understood their own business
they understood it better than anyone else could understand it for them
If handsome welleducated young gentlemen who gave shillings to
wastrels felt they wanted to become smart and capable grocers
assistants that was their affair Her business was to teach them their
work and for her own sake to see that they did it A month went by
Mrs Postwhistle found her new assistant hardworking willing somewhat
clumsy but with a smile and a laugh that transformed mistakes for which
another would have been soundly rated into welcome variations of the
days monotony

If you were the sort of woman that cared to make your fortune said one
William Clodd an old friend of Mrs Postwhistles young Grindley having
descended into the cellar to grind coffee Id tell you what to do Take
a bunshop somewhere in the neighbourhood of a girls school and put
that assistant of yours in the window Youd do a roaring business

Theres a mystery about im said Mrs Postwhistle

Know what it is

If I knew what it was I shouldnt be calling it a mystery replied
Mrs Postwhistle who was a stylist in her way

How did you get him Win him in a raffle

Jones the agent sent im to me all in a urry An assistant is what I
really wanted not an apprentice but the premium was good and the
references everything one could desire

Grindley Grindley murmured Clodd Any relation to the Sauce I
wonder

A bit more wholesome I should say from the look of him thought Mrs
Postwhistle

The question of a post office to meet its growing need had long been
under discussion by the neighbourhood Mrs Postwhistle was approached
upon the subject Grindley junior eager for anything that might bring
variety into his new cramped existence undertook to qualify himself

Within two months the arrangements were complete Grindley junior
divided his time between dispensing groceries and despatching telegrams
and letters and was grateful for the change

Grindley juniors mind was fixed upon the fashioning of a cornucopia to
receive a quarter of a pound of moist The customer an extremely young
lady was seeking to hasten his operations by tapping incessantly with a
penny on the counter It did not hurry him it only worried him
Grindley junior had not acquired facility in the fashioning of
cornucopiasthe vertex would invariably become unrolled at the last
moment allowing the contents to dribble out on to the floor or counter
Grindley junior was sweettempered as a rule but when engaged upon the
fashioning of a cornucopia was irritable

Hurry up old man urged the extremely young lady Ive got another
appointment in less than half an hour

Oh damn the thing said Grindley junior as the paper for the fourth
time reverted to its original shape

An older lady standing behind the extremely young lady and holding a
telegramform in her hand looked indignant

Temper temper remarked the extremely young lady in reproving tone

The fifth time was more successful The extremely young lady went out
commenting upon the waste of time always resulting when boys were
employed to do the work of men The older lady a haughty person handed
across her telegram with the request that it should be sent off at once

Grindley junior took his pencil from his pocket and commenced to count

_Digniori_ not _digniorus_ commented Grindley junior correcting the
word _datur digniori_ dative singular Grindley junior still
irritable from the struggle with the cornucopia spoke sharply

The haughty lady withdrew her eyes from a spot some ten miles beyond the
back of the shop where hitherto they had been resting and fixed them
for the first time upon Grindley junior

Thank you said the haughty lady

Grindley junior looked up and immediately to his annoyance felt that he
was blushing Grindley junior blushed easilyit annoyed him very much

The haughty young lady also blushed She did not often blush when she
did she felt angry with herself

A shilling and a penny demanded Grindley junior

The haughty young lady counted out the money and departed Grindley
junior peeping from behind a tin of Abernethy biscuits noticed that as
she passed the window she turned and looked back She was a very pretty
haughty lady Grindley junior rather admired dark level brows and
finely cut tremulous lips especially when combined with a mass of soft
brown hair and a rich olive complexion that flushed and paled as one
looked at it

Might send that telegram off if youve nothing else to do and theres
no particular reason for keeping it back suggested Mrs Postwhistle

Its only just been handed in explained Grindley junior somewhat
hurt

Youve been looking at it for the last five minutes by the clock said
Mrs Postwhistle

Grindley junior sat down to the machine The name and address of the
sender was Helvetia Appleyard Nevills Court

Three days passedsingularly empty days they appeared to Grindley
junior On the fourth Helvetia Appleyard had occasion to despatch
another telegramthis time entirely in English

Oneandfourpence sighed Grindley junior

Miss Appleyard drew forth her purse The shop was empty

How did you come to know Latin inquired Miss Appleyard in quite a
casual tone

I picked up a little at school It was a phrase I happened to
remember confessed Grindley junior wondering why he should be feeling
ashamed of himself

I am always sorry said Miss Appleyard when I see anyone content with
the lower life whose talents might perhaps fit him for the higher
Something about the tone and manner of Miss Appleyard reminded Grindley
junior of his former Rector Each seemed to have arrived by different
roads at the same philosophical aloofness from the world tempered by
chastened interest in human phenomena Would you like to try to raise
yourselfto improve yourselfto educate yourself

An unseen little rogue who was enjoying himself immensely whispered to
Grindley junior to say nothing but Yes he should

Will you let me help you asked Miss Appleyard And the simple and
heartfelt gratitude with which Grindley junior closed upon the offer
proved to Miss Appleyard how true it is that to do good to others is the
highest joy

Miss Appleyard had come prepared for possible acceptance You had
better begin with this thought Miss Appleyard I have marked the
passages that you should learn by heart Make a note of anything you do
not understand and I will explain it to you whenwhen next I happen to
be passing

Grindley junior took the book_Bells Introduction to the Study of the
Classics_ _for Use of Beginners_and held it between both hands Its
price was ninepence but Grindley junior appeared to regard it as a
volume of great value

It will be hard work at first Miss Appleyard warned him but you must
persevere I have taken an interest in you you must try not to
disappoint me

And Miss Appleyard feeling all the sensations of a Hypatia departed
taking light with her and forgetting to pay for the telegram Miss
Appleyard belonged to the class that young ladies who pride themselves on
being tiresomely ignorant and foolish sneer at as bluestockings that
is to say possessing brains she had felt the necessity of using them
Solomon Appleyard widower a sensible old gentleman prospering in the
printing business and seeing no necessity for a woman regarding herself
as nothing but a doll a somewhat uninteresting plaything the newness
once worn off thankfully encouraged her Miss Appleyard had returned
from Girton wise in many things but not in knowledge of the world which
knowledge too early acquired does not always make for good in young man
or woman A serious little virgin Miss Appleyards ambition was to help
the human race What more useful work could have come to her hand than
the raising of this poor but intelligent young grocers assistant unto
the knowledge and the love of higher things That Grindley junior
happened to be an exceedingly goodlooking and charming young grocers
assistant had nothing to do with the matter so Miss Appleyard would have
informed you In her own reasoning she was convinced that her interest
in him would have been the same had he been the least attractive of his
sex That there could be danger in such relationship never occurred to
her

Miss Appleyard a convinced Radical could not conceive the possibility
of a grocers assistant regarding the daughter of a welltodo printer in
any other light than that of a graciously condescending patron That
there could be danger to herself you would have been sorry you had
suggested the idea The expression of lofty scorn would have made you
feel yourself contemptible

Miss Appleyards judgment of mankind was justified no more promising
pupil could have been selected It was really marvellous the progress
made by Grindley junior under the tutelage of Helvetia Appleyard His
earnestness his enthusiasm it quite touched the heart of Helvetia
Appleyard There were many points it is true that puzzled Grindley
junior Each time the list of them grew longer But when Helvetia
Appleyard explained them all became clear She marvelled herself at her
own wisdom that in a moment made darkness luminous to this young man
his rapt attention while she talked it was most encouraging The boy
must surely be a genius To think that but for her intuition he might
have remained wasted in a grocers shop To rescue such a gem from
oblivion to polish it was surely the duty of a conscientious Hypatia
Two visitsthree visits a week to the little shop in Rolls Court were
quite inadequate so many passages there were requiring elucidation
London in early morning became their classroom the great wide empty
silent streets the mistcurtained parks the silence broken only by the
blackbirds amorous whistle the thrushes invitation to delight the old
gardens hidden behind narrow ways Nathaniel George and Janet Helvetia
would rest upon a seat no living creature within sight save perhaps a
passing policeman or some dissipated cat Janet Helvetia would expound
Nathaniel George his fine eyes fixed on hers seemed never to tire of
drinking in her wisdom

There were times when Janet Helvetia to reassure herself as to the
maidenly correctness of her behaviour had to recall quite forcibly the
fact that she was the daughter of Solomon Appleyard owner of the big
printing establishment and he a simple grocer One day raised a little
in the social scale thanks to her Nathaniel George would marry someone
in his own rank of life Reflecting upon the future of Nathaniel George
Janet Helvetia could not escape a shade of sadness It was difficult to
imagine precisely the wife she would have chosen for Nathaniel George
She hoped he would do nothing foolish Rising young men so often marry
wives that hamper rather than help them

One Sunday morning in late autumn they walked and talked in the shady
garden of Lincolns Inn Greek they thought it was they had been
talking as a matter of fact a much older language A young gardener
was watering flowers and as they passed him he grinned It was not an
offensive grin rather a sympathetic grin but Miss Appleyard didnt like
being grinned at What was there to grin at Her personal appearance
some _gaucherie_ in her dress Impossible No lady in all St Dunstan
was ever more precise She glanced at her companion a cleanlooking
wellgroomed welldressed youth Suddenly it occurred to Miss Appleyard
that she and Grindley junior were holding each others hand Miss
Appleyard was justly indignant

How dare you said Miss Appleyard I am exceedingly angry with you
How dare you

The olive skin was scarlet There were tears in the hazel eyes

Leave me this minute commanded Miss Appleyard

Instead of which Grindley junior seized both her hands

I love you I adore you I worship you poured forth young Grindley
forgetful of all Miss Appleyard had ever told him concerning the folly of
tautology

You had no right said Miss Appleyard

I couldnt help it pleaded young Grindley And that isnt the
worst

Miss Appleyard paled visibly For a grocers assistant to dare to fall
in love with her especially after all the trouble she had taken with
him What could be worse

Im not a grocer continued young Grindley deeply conscious of crime
I mean not a real grocer

And Grindley junior then and there made a clean breast of the whole sad
terrible tale of shameless deceit practised by the greatest villain the
world had ever produced upon the noblest and most beautiful maiden that
ever turned grim London town into a fairy city of enchanted ways

Not at first could Miss Appleyard entirely grasp it not till hours
later when she sat alone in her own room where fortunately for
himself Grindley junior was not did the whole force and meaning of the
thing come home to her It was a large room taking up half of the top
story of the big Georgian house in Nevills Court but even as it was
Miss Appleyard felt cramped

For a yearfor nearly a whole year said Miss Appleyard addressing
the bust of William Shakespeare have I been slaving my life out
teaching him elementary Latin and the first five books of Euclid

As it has been remarked it was fortunate for Grindley junior he was out
of reach The bust of William Shakespeare maintained its irritating
aspect of benign philosophy

I suppose I should mused Miss Appleyard if he had told me at
firstas he ought to have told meof course I should naturally have had
nothing more to do with him I suppose mused Miss Appleyard a man in
love if he is really in love doesnt quite know what hes doing I
suppose one ought to make allowances But oh when I think of it

And then Grindley juniors guardian angel must surely have slipped into
the room for Miss Appleyard irritated beyond endurance at the
philosophical indifference of the bust of William Shakespeare turned
away from it and as she did so caught sight of herself in the looking
glass Miss Appleyard approached the glass a little nearer A womans
hair is never quite as it should be Miss Appleyard standing before the
glass began she knew not why to find reasons excusing Grindley junior
After all was not forgiveness an excellent thing in woman None of us
are quite perfect The guardian angel of Grindley junior seized the
opportunity

That evening Solomon Appleyard sat upright in his chair feeling
confused So far as he could understand it a certain young man a
grocers assistant but not a grocers assistantbut that of course
was not his fault his father being an old brutehad behaved most
abominably but not on reflection as badly as he might have done and
had acted on the whole very honourably taking into consideration the
fact that one supposed he could hardly help it Helvetia was of course
very indignant with him but on the other hand did not quite see what
else she could have done she being not at all sure whether she really
cared for him or whether she didnt that everything had been quite
proper and would not have happened if she had known it that everything
was her fault except most things which werent but that of the two she
blamed herself entirely seeing that she could not have guessed anything
of the kind And did he Solomon Appleyard think that she ought to be
very angry and never marry anybody else or was she justified in
overlooking it and engaging herself to the only man she felt she could
ever love

You mustnt think Dad that I meant to deceive you I should have told
you at the beginningyou know I wouldif it hadnt all happened so
suddenly

Let me see said Solomon Appleyard did you tell me his name or
didnt you

Nathaniel said Miss Appleyard Didnt I mention it

Dont happen to know his surname do you inquired her father

Grindley explained Miss Appleyardthe son of Grindley the Sauce
man

Miss Appleyard experienced one of the surprises of her life Never
before to her recollection had her father thwarted a single wish of her
life A widower for the last twelve years his chief delight had been to
humour her His voice as he passionately swore that never with his
consent should his daughter marry the son of Hezekiah Grindley sounded
strange to her Pleadings even tears for the first time in her life
proved fruitless

Here was a pretty kettle of fish That Grindley junior should defy his
own parent risk possibly the loss of his inheritance had seemed to both
a not improper proceeding When Nathaniel George had said with fine
enthusiasm Let him keep his money if he will Ill make my own way
there isnt enough money in the world to pay for losing you Janet
Helvetia though she had expressed disapproval of such unfilial attitude
had in secret sympathised But for her to disregard the wishes of her
own doting father was not to be thought of What was to be done

Perhaps one Peter Hope residing in Gough Square hard by might help
young folks in sore dilemma with wise counsel Peter Hope editor and
part proprietor of _Good Humour_ one penny weekly was much esteemed by
Solomon Appleyard printer and publisher of aforesaid paper

A good fellow old Hope Solomon would often impress upon his managing
clerk Dont worry him more than you can help things will improve We
can trust him

Peter Hope sat at his desk facing Miss Appleyard Grindley junior sat
on the cushioned seat beneath the middle window _Good Humours_ sub
editor stood before the fire her hands behind her back

The case appeared to Peter Hope to be one of exceeding difficulty

Of course explained Miss Appleyard I shall never marry without my
fathers consent

Peter Hope thought the resolution most proper

On the other hand continued Miss Appleyard nothing shall induce me
to marry a man I do not love Miss Appleyard thought the probabilities
were that she would end by becoming a female missionary

Peter Hopes experience had led him to the conclusion that young people
sometimes changed their mind

The opinion of the House clearly though silently expressed was that
Peter Hopes experience as regarded this particular case counted for
nothing

I shall go straight to the Governor explained Grindley junior and
tell him that I consider myself engaged for life to Miss Appleyard I
know what will happenI know the sort of idea he has got into his head
He will disown me and I shall go off to Africa

Peter Hope was unable to see how Grindley juniors disappearance into the
wilds of Africa was going to assist the matter under discussion

Grindley juniors view was that the wilds of Africa would afford a
fitting background to the passing away of a blighted existence

Peter Hope had a suspicion that Grindley junior had for the moment parted
company with that sweet reasonableness that otherwise so Peter Hope felt
sure was Grindley juniors guiding star

I mean it sir reasserted Grindley junior I am Grindley junior
was about to add well educated but divining that education was a topic
not pleasing at the moment to the ears of Helvetia Appleyard had tact
enough to substitute not a fool I can earn my own living and I should
like to get away

It seems to me said the subeditor

Now TommyI mean Jane warned her Peter Hope He always called her
Jane in company unless he was excited I know what you are going to
say I wont have it

I was only going to say urged the subeditor in tone of one suffering
injustice

I quite know what you were going to say retorted Peter hotly I can
see it by your chin You are going to take their partand suggest their
acting undutifully towards their parents

I wasnt returned the subeditor I was only

You were persisted Peter I ought not to have allowed you to be
present I might have known you would interfere

going to say we are in want of some help in the office You know we
are And that if Mr Grindley would be content with a small salary

Small salary be hanged snarled Peter

there would be no need for his going to Africa

And how would that help us demanded Peter Even if the boy were
soso headstrong so unfilial as to defy his father who has worked for
him all these years how would that remove the obstacle of Mr
Appleyards refusal

Why dont you see explained the subeditor

No I dont snapped Peter

If on his declaring to his father that nothing will ever induce him to
marry any other woman but Miss Appleyard his father disowns him as he
thinks it likely

A dead cert was Grindley juniors conviction

Very well he is no longer old Grindleys son and what possible
objection can Mr Appleyard have to him then

Peter Hope arose and expounded at length and in suitable language the
folly and uselessness of the scheme

But what chance had ever the wisdom of Age against the enthusiasm of
Youth reaching for its object Poor Peter expostulating was swept
into the conspiracy Grindley junior the next morning stood before his
father in the private office in High Holborn

I am sorry sir said Grindley junior if I have proved a
disappointment to you

Damn your sympathy said Grindley senior Keep it till you are asked
for it

I hope we part friends sir said Grindley junior holding out his
hand

Why do you irate me asked Grindley senior I have thought of nothing
but you these fiveandtwenty years

I dont sir answered Grindley junior I cant say I love you It
did not seem to me youyou wanted it But I like you sir and I
respect you Andand Im sorry to have to hurt you sir

And you are determined to give up all your prospects all the money for
the sake of thisthis girl

It doesnt seem like giving up anything sir replied Grindley junior
simply

It isnt so much as I thought it was going to be said the old man
after a pause Perhaps it is for the best I might have been more
obstinate if things had been going all right The Lord has chastened
me

Isnt the business doing well Dad asked the young man with sorrow in
his voice

Whats it got to do with you snapped his father Youve cut yourself
adrift from it You leave me now I am going down

Grindley junior not knowing what to say put his arms round the little
old man

And in this way Tommys brilliant scheme fell through and came to naught
Instead old Grindley visited once again the big house in Nevills Court
and remained long closeted with old Solomon in the office on the second
floor It was late in the evening when Solomon opened the door and
called upstairs to Janet Helvetia to come down

I used to know you long ago said Hezekiah Grindley rising You were
quite a little girl then

Later the troublesome Sauce disappeared entirely cut out by newer
flavours Grindley junior studied the printing business It almost
seemed as if old Appleyard had been waiting but for this Some six
months later they found him dead in his countinghouse Grindley junior
became the printer and publisher of _Good Humour_




STORY THE FOURTHMiss Ramsbotham gives her Services


To regard Miss Ramsbotham as a marriageable quantity would have occurred
to few men Endowed by Nature with every feminine quality calculated to
inspire liking she had on the other hand been disinherited of every
attribute calculated to excite passion An ugly woman has for some men
an attraction the proof is ever present to our eyes Miss Ramsbotham
was plain but pleasant looking Large healthy in mind and body
capable selfreliant and cheerful blessed with a happy disposition
together with a keen sense of humour there was about her absolutely
nothing for tenderness to lay hold of An ideal wife she was an
impossible sweetheart Every man was her friend The suggestion that
any man could be her lover she herself would have greeted with a clear
ringing laugh

Not that she held love in despite for such folly she was possessed of
far too much sound sense To have somebody in love with yousomebody
strong and good so she would confess to her few close intimates a
dreamy expression clouding for an instant her broad sunny face why it
must be just lovely For Miss Ramsbotham was prone to American
phraseology and had even been at some pains during a six months
journey through the States whither she had been commissioned by a
conscientious trade journal seeking reliable information concerning the
condition of female textile workers to acquire a slight but decided
American accent It was her one affectation but assumed as one might
feel certain for a practical and legitimate object

You can have no conception she would explain laughing what a help I
find it Im Muriken is the Civis Romanus sum of the modern womans
world It opens every door to us If I ring the bell and say Oh if
you please I have come to interview Mr SoandSo for suchandsuch a
paper the footman looks through me at the opposite side of the street
and tells me to wait in the hall while he inquires if Mr SoandSo will
see me or not But if I say Thats my keerd young man You tell your
master Miss Ramsbotham is waiting for him in the showroom and will take
it real kind if hell just bustle himself the poor fellow walks
backwards till he stumbles against the bottom stair and my gentleman
comes down with profuse apologies for having kept me waiting three
minutes and a half

And to be in love with someone she would continue someone great
that one could look up to and honour and worshipsomeone that would fill
ones whole life make it beautiful make every day worth living I think
that would be better still To work merely for ones self to think
merely for ones self it is so much less interesting

Then at some such point of the argument Miss Ramsbotham would jump up
from her chair and shake herself indignantly

Why what nonsense Im talking she would tell herself and her
listeners I make a very fair income have a host of friends and enjoy
every hour of my life I should like to have been pretty or handsome of
course but no one can have all the good things of this world and I have
my brains At one time perhaps yes but nowno honestly I would not
change myself

Miss Ramsbotham was sorry that no man had ever fallen in love with her
but that she could understand

It is quite clear to me So she had once unburdened herself to her
bosom friend Man for the purposes of the race has been given two kinds
of love between which according to his opportunities and temperament
he is free to choose he can fall down upon his knees and adore physical
beauty for Nature ignores entirely our mental side or he can take
delight in circling with his protecting arm the weak and helpless Now
I make no appeal to either instinct I possess neither the charm nor
beauty to attract

Beauty reminded her the bosom friend consolingly dwells in the
beholders eye

My dear cheerfully replied Miss Ramsbotham it would have to be an
eye of the range and capacity Sam Weller frankly owned up to not
possessinga patent doublemillion magnifying capable of seeing through
a deal board and round the corner sort of eyeto detect any beauty in
me And I am much too big and sensible for any man not a fool ever to
think of wanting to take care of me

I believe remembered Miss Ramsbotham if it does not sound like idle
boasting I might have had a husband of a kind if Fate had not
compelled me to save his life I met him one year at Huyst a small
quiet wateringplace on the Dutch coast He would walk always half a
step behind me regarding me out of the corner of his eye quite
approvingly at times He was a widowera good little man devoted to
his three charming children They took an immense fancy to me and I
really think I could have got on with him I am very adaptable as you
know But it was not to be He got out of his depth one morning and
unfortunately there was no one within distance but myself who could swim
I knew what the result would be You remember Labiches comedy _Les
Voyage de Monsieur Perrichon_ Of course every man hates having had his
life saved after it is over and you can imagine how he must hate having
it saved by a woman But what was I to do In either case he would be
lost to me whether I let him drown or whether I rescued him So as it
really made no difference I rescued him He was very grateful and left
the next morning

It is my destiny No man has ever fallen in love with me and no man
ever will I used to worry myself about it when I was younger As a
child I hugged to my bosom for years an observation I had overheard an
aunt of mine whisper to my mother one afternoon as they sat knitting and
talking not thinking I was listening You never can tell murmured my
aunt keeping her eyes carefully fixed upon her needles children change
so I have known the plainest girls grow up into quite beautiful women
I should not worry about it if I were younot yet awhile My mother
was not at all a badlooking woman and my father was decidedly handsome
so there seemed no reason why I should not hope I pictured myself the
ugly duckling of Andersens fairytale and every morning on waking I
would run straight to my glass and try to persuade myself that the
feathers of the swan were beginning at last to show themselves Miss
Ramsbotham laughed a genuine laugh of amusement for of selfpity not a
trace was now remaining to her

Later I plucked hope again continued Miss Ramsbotham her confession
from the reading of a certain school of fiction more popular twenty
years ago than now In these romances the heroine was never what you
would call beautiful unless in common with the hero you happened to
possess exceptional powers of observation But she was better than that
she was good I do not regard as time wasted the hours I spent studying
this quaint literature It helped me I am sure to form habits that
have since been of service to me I made a point when any young man
visitor happened to be staying with us of rising exceptionally early in
the morning so that I always appeared at the breakfasttable fresh
cheerful and carefully dressed with when possible a dewbesprinkled
flower in my hair to prove that I had already been out in the garden The
effort as far as the young man visitor was concerned was always thrown
away as a general rule he came down late himself and generally too
drowsy to notice anything much But it was excellent practice for me I
wake now at seven oclock as a matter of course whatever time I go to
bed I made my own dresses and most of our cakes and took care to let
everybody know it Though I say it who should not I play and sing
rather well I certainly was never a fool I had no little brothers and
sisters to whom to be exceptionally devoted but I had my cousins about
the house as much as possible and damaged their characters if anything
by overindulgence My dear it never caught even a curate I am not
one of those women to run down men I think them delightful creatures
and in a general way I find them very intelligent But where their
hearts are concerned it is the girl with the frizzy hair who wants two
people to help her over the stile that is their idea of an angel No
man could fall in love with me he couldnt if he tried That I can
understand butMiss Ramsbotham sunk her voice to a more confidential
tonewhat I cannot understand is that I have never fallen in love with
any man because I like them all

You have given the explanation yourself suggested the bosom friendone
Susan Fossett the Aunt Emma of _The Ladies Journal_ a nice woman
but talkative You are too sensible

Miss Ramsbotham shook her head I should just love to fall in love When
I think about it I feel quite ashamed of myself for not having done so

Whether it was this idea namely that it was her duty or whether it was
that passion came to her unsought somewhat late in life and therefore
all the stronger she herself would perhaps have been unable to declare
Certain only it is that at over thirty years of age this clever
sensible clearseeing woman fell to sighing and blushing starting and
stammering at the sounding of a name as though for all the world she had
been a lovesick girl in her teens

Susan Fossett her bosom friend brought the strange tidings to Bohemia
one foggy November afternoon her opportunity being a teaparty given by
Peter Hope to commemorate the birthday of his adopted daughter and sub
editor Jane Helen commonly called Tommy The actual date of Tommys
birthday was known only to the gods but out of the London mist to
wifeless childless Peter she had come the evening of a certain November
the eighteenth and therefore by Peter and his friends November the
eighteenth had been marked upon the calendar as a day on which they
should rejoice together

It is bound to leak out sooner or later Susan Fossett was convinced
so I may as well tell you that gaby Mary Ramsbotham has got herself
engaged

Nonsense was Peter Hopes involuntary ejaculation

Precisely what I mean to tell her the very next time I see her added
Susan

Who to demanded Tommy

You mean to whom The preeposition governs the objective case
corrected her James Douglas McTear commonly called The Wee Laddie who
himself wrote English better than he spoke it

I meant to whom explained Tommy

Ye didna say it persisted the Wee Laddie

I dont know to whom replied Miss Ramsbothams bosom friend sipping
tea and breathing indignation To something idiotic and incongruous
that will make her life a misery to her

Somerville the briefless held that in the absence of all data such
conclusion was unjustifiable

If it had been to anything sensible was Miss Fossetts opinion she
would not have kept me in the dark about it to spring it upon me like a
bombshell Ive never had so much as a hint from her until I received
this absurd scrawl an hour ago

Miss Fossett produced from her bag a letter written in pencil

There can be no harm in your hearing it was Miss Fossetts excuse it
will give you an idea of the state of the poor things mind

The teadrinkers left their cups and gathered round her Dear Susan
read Miss Fossett I shall not be able to be with you tomorrow Please
get me out of it nicely I cant remember at the moment what it is
Youll be surprised to hear that Im _engaged_to be married I mean I
can hardly _realise_ it I hardly seem to know where I am Have just
made up my mind to run down to Yorkshire and see grandmamma I must do
_something_ I must _talk_ to _somebody_ andforgive me dearbut you
_are_ so sensible and just nowwell I dont _feel_ sensible Will tell
you all about it when I see younext week perhaps You must _try_ to
like him He is _so_ handsome and _really_ cleverin his own way Dont
scold me I never thought it possible that _anyone_ could be so happy
Its quite a different sort of happiness to _any_ other sort of
happiness I dont know how to describe it Please ask Burcot to let me
off the antequarian congress I feel I should do it badly I am so
thankful he has _no_ relativesin England I should have been so
_terribly_ nervous Twelve hours ago I could not have _dreamt_ of it
and now I walk on tiptoe for fear of waking up Did I leave my
chinchilla at your rooms Dont be angry with me I should have told
you if I had known In haste Yours Mary

Its dated from Marylebone Road and yesterday afternoon she did leave
her chinchilla in my rooms which makes me think it really must be from
Mary Ramsbotham Otherwise I should have my doubts added Miss Fossett
as she folded up the letter and replaced it in her bag

Id is love was the explanation of Dr William Smith his round red
face illuminated with poetic ecstasy Love has gone to herhas
dransformed her once again into the leedle maid

Love retorted Susan Fossett doesnt transform an intelligent
educated woman into a person who writes a letter all in jerks underlines
every other word spells antiquarian with an e and Burcotts name
whom she has known for the last eight years with only one t The
woman has gone stark staring mad

We must wait until we have seen him was Peters judicious view I
should be so glad to think that the dear lady was happy

So should I added Miss Fossett drily

One of the most sensible women I have ever met commented William
Clodd Lucky man whoever he is Half wish Id thought of it myself

I am not saying that he isnt retorted Miss Fossett It isnt him
Im worrying about

I preesume you mean he suggested the Wee Laddie The verb to
be

For goodness sake suggested Miss Fossett to Tommy give that man
something to eat or drink Thats the worst of people who take up
grammar late in life Like all converts they become fanatical

Shes a ripping good sort is Mary Ramsbotham exclaimed Grindley
junior printer and publisher of _Good Humour_ The marvel to me is
that no man hitherto has ever had the sense to want her

Oh you men cried Miss Fossett A pretty face and an empty head is
all you want

Must they always go together laughed Mrs Grindley junior _nee_
Helvetia Appleyard

Exceptions prove the rule grunted Miss Fossett

What a happy saying that is smiled Mrs Grindley junior I wonder
sometimes how conversation was ever carried on before it was invented

De man who would fall in love wid our dear frent Mary thought Dr
Smith he must be quite egsceptional

You neednt talk about her as if she was a monsterI mean were
corrected herself Miss Fossett with a hasty glance towards the Wee
Laddie There isnt a man I know thats worthy of her

I mean explained the doctor dat he must be a man of characterof
brain Id is de noble man dat is attracted by de noble woman

By the chorusgirl more often suggested Miss Fossett

We must hope for the best counselled Peter I cannot believe that a
clever capable woman like Mary Ramsbotham would make a fool of herself

From what I have seen replied Miss Fossett its just the clever
peopleas regards this particular matterwho do make fools of
themselves

Unfortunately Miss Fossetts judgment proved to be correct On being
introduced a fortnight later to Miss Ramsbothams fiance the impulse of
Bohemia was to exclaim Great Scott Whatever in the name of Then
on catching sight of Miss Ramsbothams transfigured face and trembling
hands Bohemia recollected itself in time to murmur instead Delighted
Im sure and to offer mechanical congratulations Reginald Peters was
a pretty but remarkably foolishlooking lad of about twoandtwenty with
curly hair and receding chin but to Miss Ramsbotham evidently a
promising Apollo Her first meeting with him had taken place at one of
the many political debating societies then in fashion attendance at
which Miss Ramsbotham found useful for purposes of journalistic copy
Miss Ramsbotham hitherto a Radical of pronounced views he had succeeded
under three months in converting into a strong supporter of the
Gentlemanly Party His feeble political platitudes which a little while
before she would have seized upon merrily to ridicule she now sat
drinking in her plain face suffused with admiration Away from him and
in connection with those subjectssomewhat numerousabout which he knew
little and cared less she retained her sense and humour but in his
presence she remained comparatively speechless gazing up into his
somewhat watery eyes with the grateful expression of one learning wisdom
from a master

Her absurd adorationirritating beyond measure to her friends and which
even to her lover had he possessed a grain of sense would have appeared
ridiculousto Master Peters was evidently a gratification Of selfish
exacting nature he must have found the services of this brilliant woman
of the world of much practical advantage Knowing all the most
interesting people in London it was her pride and pleasure to introduce
him everywhere Her friends put up with him for her sake to please her
made him welcome did their best to like him and disguised their
failure The free entry to a places of amusement saved his limited
purse Her influence he had instinct enough to perceive could not fail
to be of use to him in his profession that of a barrister She praised
him to prominent solicitors took him to tea with judges wives
interested examiners on his behalf In return he overlooked her many
disadvantages and did not fail to let her know it Miss Ramsbothams
gratitude was boundless

I do so wish I were younger and better looking she sighed to the bosom
friend For myself I dont mind I have got used to it But it is so
hard on Reggie He feels it I know he does though he never openly
complains

He would be a cad if he did answered Susan Fossett who having tried
conscientiously for a month to tolerate the fellow had in the end
declared her inability even to do more than avoid open expression of
cordial dislike Added to which I dont quite see of what use it would
be You never told him you were young and pretty did you

I told him my dear replied Miss Ramsbotham the actual truth I
dont want to take any credit for doing so it seemed the best course
You see unfortunately I look my age With most men it would have made
a difference You have no idea how good he is He assured me he had
engaged himself to me with his eyes open and that there was no need to
dwell upon unpleasant topics It is so wonderful to me that he should
care for mehe who could have half the women in London at his feet

Yes hes the type that would attract them I daresay agreed Susan
Fossett But are you quite sure that he doescare for you I mean

My dear returned Miss Ramsbotham you remember Rochefoucaulds
definition One loves the other consents to be loved If he will
only let me do that I shall be content It is more than I had any right
to expect

Oh you are a fool told her bluntly her bosom friend

I know I am admitted Miss Ramsbotham but I had no idea that being a
fool was so delightful

Bohemia grew day by day more indignant and amazed Young Peters was not
even a gentleman All the little offices of courtship he left to her It
was she who helped him on with his coat and afterwards adjusted her own
cloak she who carried the parcel she who followed into and out of the
restaurant Only when he thought anyone was watching would he make any
attempt to behave to her with even ordinary courtesy He bullied her
contradicted her in public ignored her openly Bohemia fumed with
impotent rage yet was bound to confess that so far as Miss Ramsbotham
herself was concerned he had done more to make her happy than had ever
all Bohemia put together A tender light took up its dwelling in her
eyes which for the first time it was noticed were singularly deep and
expressive The blood of which she possessed if anything too much now
came and went so that her cheeks in place of their insistent red took
on a varied pink and white Life had entered her thick dark hair giving
to it shade and shadow

The woman began to grow younger She put on flesh Sex hitherto
dormant began to show itself femininities peeped out New tones
suggesting possibilities crept into her voice Bohemia congratulated
itself that the affair after all might turn out well

Then Master Peters spoiled everything by showing a better side to his
nature and careless of all worldly considerations falling in love
himself honestly with a girl at the bun shop He did the best thing
under the circumstances that he could have done told Miss Ramsbotham the
plain truth and left the decision in her hands

Miss Ramsbotham acted as anyone who knew her would have foretold
Possibly in the silence of her delightful little fourroomed flat over
the tailors shop in Marylebone Road her sober worthy maid dismissed
for a holiday she may have shed some tears but if so no trace of them
was allowed to mar the peace of mind of Mr Peters She merely thanked
him for being frank with her and by a little present pain saving them
both a future of disaster It was quite understandable she knew he had
never really been in love with her She had thought him the type of man
that never does fall in love as the word is generally understoodMiss
Ramsbotham did not add with anyone except himselfand had that been the
case and he content merely to be loved they might have been happy
together As it waswell it was fortunate he had found out the truth
before it was too late Now would he take her advice

Mr Peters was genuinely grateful as well he might be and would consent
to any suggestion that Miss Ramsbotham might make felt he had behaved
shabbily was very much ashamed of himself would be guided in all things
by Miss Ramsbotham whom he should always regard as the truest of
friends and so on

Miss Ramsbothams suggestion was this Mr Peters no more robust of body
than of mind had been speaking for some time past of travel Having
nothing to do now but to wait for briefs why not take this opportunity
of visiting his only welltodo relative a Canadian farmer Meanwhile
let Miss Peggy leave the bun shop and take up her residence in Miss
Ramsbothams flat Let there be no engagementmerely an understanding
The girl was pretty charming good Miss Ramsbotham felt sure butwell
a little education a little training in manners and behaviour would not
be amiss would it If on returning at the end of six months or a year
Mr Peters was still of the same mind and Peggy also wishful the affair
would be easier would it not

There followed further expressions of eternal gratitude Miss Ramsbotham
swept all such aside It would be pleasant to have a bright young girl
to live with her teaching moulding such an one would be a pleasant
occupation

And thus it came to pass that Mr Reginald Peters disappeared for a while
from Bohemia to the regret of but few and there entered into it one
Peggy Nutcombe as pretty a child as ever gladdened the eye of man She
had wavy flaxen hair a complexion that might have been manufactured
from the essence of wild roses the nose that Tennyson bestows upon his
millers daughter and a mouth worthy of the Lowther Arcade in its days
of glory Add to this the quick grace of a kitten with the appealing
helplessness of a baby in its first short frock and you will be able to
forgive Mr Reginald Peters his faithlessness Bohemia looked from one
to the otherfrom the fairy to the womanand ceased to blame That the
fairy was as stupid as a camel as selfish as a pig and as lazy as a
nigger Bohemia did not know norso long as her figure and complexion
remained what it waswould its judgment have been influenced even if it
had I speak of the Bohemian male

But that is just what her figure and complexion did not do Mr Reginald
Peters finding his uncle old feeble and inclined to be fond deemed it
to his advantage to stay longer than he had intended Twelve months went
by Miss Peggy was losing her kittenish grace was becoming lumpy A
couple of pimplesone near the righthand corner of her rosebud mouth
and another on the lefthand side of her tiptilted nosemarred her baby
face At the end of another six months the men called her plump and the
women fat Her walk was degenerating into a waddle stairs caused her to
grunt She took to breathing with her mouth and Bohemia noticed that
her teeth were small badly coloured and uneven The pimples grew in
size and number The cream and white of her complexion was merging into
a general yellow A certain greasiness of skin was manifesting itself
Babyish ways in connection with a woman who must have weighed about
eleven stone struck Bohemia as incongruous Her manners judged alone
had improved But they had not improved her They did not belong to
her they did not fit her They sat on her as Sunday broadcloth on a
yokel She had learned to employ her hs correctly and to speak good
grammar This gave to her conversation a painfully artificial air The
little learning she had absorbed was sufficient to bestow upon her an
angry consciousness of her own invincible ignorance

Meanwhile Miss Ramsbotham had continued upon her course of rejuvenation
At twentynine she had looked thirtyfive at thirtytwo she looked not a
day older than fiveandtwenty Bohemia felt that should she retrograde
further at the same rate she would soon have to shorten her frocks and
let down her hair A nervous excitability had taken possession of her
that was playing strange freaks not only with her body but with her
mind What it gave to the one it seemed to take from the other Old
friends accustomed to enjoy with her the luxury of plain speech
wondered in vain what they had done to offend her Her desire was now
towards new friends new faces Her sense of humour appeared to be
departing from her it became unsafe to jest with her On the other
hand she showed herself greedy for admiration and flattery Her former
chums stepped back astonished to watch brainless young fops making their
way with her by complimenting her upon her blouse or whispering to her
some trite nonsense about her eyelashes From her work she took a good
percentage of her brain power to bestow it on her clothes Of course
she was successful Her dresses suited her showed her to the best
advantage Beautiful she could never be and had sense enough to know
it but a charming distinguishedlooking woman she had already become
Also she was on the high road to becoming a vain egotistical
commonplace woman

It was during the process of this her metamorphosis that Peter Hope one
evening received a note from her announcing her intention of visiting him
the next morning at the editorial office of _Good Humour_ She added in
a postscript that she would prefer the interview to be private

Punctually to the time appointed Miss Ramsbotham arrived Miss
Ramsbotham contrary to her custom opened conversation with the weather
Miss Ramsbotham was of opinion that there was every possibility of rain
Peter Hopes experience was that there was always possibility of rain

How is the Paper doing demanded Miss Ramsbotham

The Paperfor a paper not yet two years oldwas doing well We expect
very shortlyvery shortly indeed explained Peter Hope to turn the
corner

Ah that corner sympathised Miss Ramsbotham

I confess smiled Peter Hope it doesnt seem to be exactly a right
angled corner One reaches it as one thinks But it takes some getting
roundwhat I should describe as a cornery corner

What you want thought Miss Ramsbotham are one or two popular
features

Popular features agreed Peter guardedly scenting temptation are not
to be despised provided one steers clear of the vulgar and the
commonplace

A Ladies Page suggested Miss Ramsbothama page that should make the
woman buy it The women believe me are going to be of more and more
importance to the weekly press

But why should she want a special page to herself demanded Peter Hope
Why should not the paper as a whole appeal to her

It doesnt was all Miss Ramsbotham could offer in explanation

We give her literature and the drama poetry fiction the higher
politics the

I know I know interrupted Miss Ramsbotham who of late among other
failings new to her had developed a tendency towards impatience but
she gets all that in half a dozen other papers I have thought it out
Miss Ramsbotham leaned further across the editorial desk and sunk her
voice unconsciously to a confidential whisper Tell her the coming
fashions Discuss the question whether hat or bonnet makes you look the
younger Tell her whether red hair or black is to be the new colour
what size waist is being worn by the best people Oh come laughed
Miss Ramsbotham in answer to Peters shocked expression one cannot
reform the world and human nature all at once You must appeal to
peoples folly in order to get them to listen to your wisdom Make your
paper a success first You can make it a power afterwards

But argued Peter there are already such paperspapers devoted toto
that sort of thing and to nothing else

At sixpence replied the practical Miss Ramsbotham I am thinking of
the lower middleclass woman who has twenty pounds a year to spend on
dress and who takes twelve hours a day to think about it poor creature
My dear friend there is a fortune in it Think of the advertisements

Poor Peter groanedold Peter the dreamer of dreams But for thought of
Tommy one day to be left alone to battle with a stonyeyed deaf world
Peter most assuredly would have risen in his wrath would have said to
his distinguishedlooking temptress Get thee behind me Miss
Ramsbotham My journalistic instinct whispers to me that your scheme
judged by the mammon of unrighteousness is good It is a new departure
Ten years hence half the London journals will have adopted it There is
money in it But what of that Shall I for mere dross sell my editorial
soul turn the temple of the Mighty Pen into a den ofof milliners Good
morning Miss Ramsbotham I grieve for you I grieve for you as for a
fellowworker once inspired by devotion to a noble calling who has
fallen from her high estate Good morning madam

So Peter thought as he sat tattooing with his fingertips upon the desk
but only said

It would have to be well done

Everything would depend upon how it was done agreed Miss Ramsbotham
Badly done the idea would be wasted You would be merely giving it
away to some other paper

Do you know of anyone queried Peter

I was thinking of myself answered Miss Ramsbotham

I am sorry said Peter Hope

Why demanded Miss Ramsbotham Dont you think I could do it

I think said Peter no one could do it better I am sorry you should
wish to do itthat is all

I want to do it replied Miss Ramsbotham a note of doggedness in her
voice

How much do you propose to charge me Peter smiled

Nothing

My dear lady

I could not in conscience explained Miss Ramsbotham take payment
from both sides I am going to make a good deal out of it I am going
to make out of it at least three hundred a year and they will be glad to
pay it

Who will

The dressmakers I shall be one of the most stylish women in London
laughed Miss Ramsbotham

You used to be a sensible woman Peter reminded her

I want to live

Cant you manage to do it withoutwithout being a fool my dear

No answered Miss Ramsbotham a woman cant Ive tried it

Very well agreed Peter be it so

Peter had risen He laid his shapely white old hand upon the womans
shoulder Tell me when you want to give it up I shall be glad

Thus it was arranged _Good Humour_ gained circulation andof more
importance yetadvertisements and Miss Ramsbotham as she had
predicted the reputation of being one of the bestdressed women in
London Her reason for desiring such reputation Peter Hope had shrewdly
guessed Two months later his suspicions were confirmed Mr Reginald
Peters his uncle being dead was on his way back to England

His return was awaited with impatience only by the occupants of the
little flat in the Marylebone Road and between these two the difference
of symptom was marked Mistress Peggy too stupid to comprehend the
change that had been taking place in her looked forward to her lovers
arrival with delight Mr Reginald Peters independently of his
profession was in consequence of his uncles death a man of means Miss
Ramsbothams tutelage which had always been distasteful to her would
now be at an end She would be a lady in the true sense of the
wordaccording to Miss Peggys definition a woman with nothing to do
but eat and drink and nothing to think of but dress Miss Ramsbotham
on the other hand who might have anticipated the homecoming of her
quondam admirer with hope exhibited a strange condition of alarmed
misery which increased from day to day as the date drew nearer

The meetingwhether by design or accident was never knowntook place at
an evening party given by the proprietors of a new journal The
circumstance was certainly unfortunate for poor Peggy whom Bohemia began
to pity Mr Peters knowing both women would be there and so on the
lookout saw in the distance among the crowd of notabilities a superbly
millinered tall graceful woman whose face recalled sensations he could
not for the moment place Chiefly noticeable about her were her
exquisite neck and arms and the air of perfect breeding with which she
moved talking and laughing through the distinguished fashionable
throng Beside her strutted nervously aggressive a vulgar fat
pimply shapeless young woman attracting universal attention by the
incongruity of her presence in the room On being greeted by the
graceful lady of the neck and arms the conviction forced itself upon him
that this could be no other than the once Miss Ramsbotham plain of face
and indifferent of dress whose very appearance he had almost forgotten
On being greeted gushingly as Reggie by the sallowcomplexioned over
dressed young woman he bowed with evident astonishment and apologised
for a memory that so he assured the lady had always been to him a
source of despair

Of course he thanked his starsand Miss Ramsbothamthat the engagement
had never been formal So far as Mr Peters was concerned there was an
end to Mistress Peggys dream of an existence of everlasting breakfasts
in bed Leaving the Ramsbotham flat she returned to the maternal roof
and there a course of hard work and plain living tended greatly to
improve her figure and complexion so that in course of time the gods
smiling again upon her she married a foreman printer and passes out of
this story

Meanwhile Mr Reginald Petersolder and the possessor perhaps of
more senselooked at Miss Ramsbotham with new eyes and now not
tolerated but desired her Bohemia waited to assist at the happy
termination of a pretty and somewhat novel romance Miss Ramsbotham had
shown no sign of being attracted elsewhere Flattery compliment she
continued to welcome but merely so it seemed as favourable criticism
Suitors more fit and proper were now not lacking for Miss Ramsbotham
though a woman less desirable when won came readily to the thought of
wooing But to all such she turned a laughing face

I like her for it declared Susan Fossett and he has improvedthere
was room for itthough I wish it could have been some other There was
Jack Herringit would have been so much more suitable Or even Joe in
spite of his size But its her wedding not ours and she will never
care for anyone else

And Bohemia bought its presents and had them ready but never gave them
A few months later Mr Reginald Peters returned to Canada a bachelor
Miss Ramsbotham expressed her desire for another private interview with
Peter Hope

I may as well keep on the Letter to Clorinda thought Miss Ramsbotham
I have got into the knack of it But I will get you to pay me for it in
the ordinary way

I would rather have done so from the beginning explained Peter

I know I could not in conscience as I told you take from both sides
For the futurewell they have said nothing but I expect they are
beginning to get tired of it

And you questioned Peter

Yes I am tired of it myself laughed Miss Ramsbotham Life isnt
long enough to be a welldressed woman

You have done with all that

I hope so answered Miss Ramsbotham

And dont want to talk any more about it suggested Peter

Not just at present I should find it so difficult to explain

By others less sympathetic than old Peter vigorous attempts were made
to solve the mystery Miss Ramsbotham took enjoyment in cleverly evading
these tormentors Thwarted at every point the gossips turned to other
themes Miss Ramsbotham found interest once again in the higher branches
of her calling became again by slow degrees the sensible frank good
sort that Bohemia had known liked respectedeverything but loved

Years later to Susan Fossett the case was made clear and through Susan
Fossett a nice enough woman but talkative those few still interested
learned the explanation

Love said Miss Ramsbotham to the bosom friend is not regulated by
reason As you say there were many men I might have married with much
more hope of happiness But I never cared for any other man He was not
intellectual was egotistical possibly enough selfish The man should
always be older than the woman he was younger and he was a weak
character Yet I loved him

I am glad you didnt marry him said the bosom friend

So am I agreed Miss Ramsbotham

If you cant trust me had said the bosom friend at this point
dont

I meant to do right said Miss Ramsbotham upon my word of honour I
did in the beginning

I dont understand said the bosom friend

If she had been my own child continued Miss Ramsbotham I could not
have done morein the beginning I tried to teach her to put some
sense into her Lord the hours I wasted on that little idiot I marvel
at my own patience She was nothing but an animal An animal she had
only an animals vices To eat and drink and sleep was her idea of
happiness her one ambition male admiration and she hadnt character
enough to put sufficient curb upon her stomach to retain it I reasoned
with her I pleaded with her I bullied her Had I persisted I might
have succeeded by sheer physical and mental strength in restraining her
from ruining herself I was winning I had made her frightened of me
Had I gone on I might have won By dragging her out of bed in the
morning by insisting upon her taking exercise by regulating every
particle of food and drink she put into her mouth I kept the little
beast in good condition for nearly three months Then I had to go away
into the country for a few days she swore she would obey my
instructions When I came back I found she had been in bed most of the
time and had been living chiefly on chocolate and cakes She was curled
up asleep in an easychair snoring with her mouth wide open when I
opened the door And at sight of that picture the devil came to me and
tempted me Why should I waste my time wear myself out in mind and
body that the man I loved should marry a pig because it looked like an
angel Six months wallowing according to its own desires would reveal
it in its true shape So from that day I left it to itself No worse
than thatI dont want to spare myselfI encouraged her I let her
have a fire in her bedroom and half her meals in bed I let her have
chocolate with tablespoonfuls of cream floating on the top she loved it
She was never really happy except when eating I let her order her own
meals I took a fiendish delight watching the dainty limbs turning to
shapeless fat the pinkandwhite complexion growing blotchy It is
flesh that man loves brain and mind and heart and soul he never thinks
of them This little pinkandwhite sow could have cut me out with
Solomon himself Why should such creatures have the world arranged for
them and we not be allowed to use our brains in our own defence But
for my lookingglass I might have resisted the temptation but I always
had something of the man in me the sport of the thing appealed to me I
suppose it was the nervous excitement under which I was living that was
changing me All my sap was going into my body Given sufficient time
I might meet her with her own weapons animal against animal Well you
know the result I won There was no doubt about his being in love with
me His eyes would follow me round the room feasting on me I had
become a fine animal Men desired me Do you know why I refused him He
was in every way a better man than the silly boy I had fallen in love
with but he came back with a couple of false teeth I saw the gold
setting one day when he opened his mouth to laugh I dont say for a
moment my dear there is no such thing as lovelove pure ennobling
worthy of men and women its roots in the heart and nowhere else But
that love I had missed and the other I saw it in its true light I
had fallen in love with him because he was a pretty curlyheaded boy He
had fallen in love with Peggy when she was pinkandwhite and slim I
shall always see the look that came into his eyes when she spoke to him
at the hotel the look of disgust and loathing The girl was the same
it was only her body that had grown older I could see his eyes fixed
upon my arms and neck I had got to grow old in time brown skinned and
wrinkled I thought of him growing bald fat

If you had fallen in love with the right man had said Susan Fossett
those ideas would not have come to you

I know said Miss Ramsbotham He will have to like me thin and in
these clothes just because I am nice and good company and helpful
That is the man I am waiting for

He never came along A charming brighteyed whitehaired lady occupies
alone a little flat in the Marylebone Road looks in occasionally at the
Writers Club She is still Miss Ramsbotham

Baldheaded gentlemen feel young again talking to her she is so
sympathetic so bigminded so understanding Then hearing the clock
strike tear themselves from her with a sigh and return homesome of
themto stupid shrewish wives




STORY THE FIFTHJoey Loveredge agreeson certain termsto join the
Company


The most popular member of the Autolycus Club was undoubtedly Joseph
Loveredge Small chubby cleanshaven his somewhat longish soft
brown hair parted in the middle strangers fell into the error of
assuming him to be younger than he really was It is on record that a
leading lady novelistaccepting her at her own estimateirritated by
his polite but firm refusal to allow her entrance into his own editorial
office without appointment had once boxed his ears under the impression
that he was his own officeboy Guests to the Autolycus Club on being
introduced to him would give to him kind messages to take home to his
father with whom they remembered having been at school together This
sort of thing might have annoyed anyone with less sense of humour Joseph
Loveredge would tell such stories himself keenly enjoying the jestwas
even suspected of inventing some of the more improbable Another fact
tending to the popularity of Joseph Loveredge among all classes over and
above his amiability his wit his genuine kindliness and his
neverfailing fund of good stories was that by care and inclination he
had succeeded in remaining a bachelor Many had been the attempts to
capture him nor with the passing of the years had interest in the sport
shown any sign of diminution Well over the frailties and distempers so
dangerous to youth of staid and sober habits with an everincreasing
capital invested in sound securities together with an everincreasing
income from his pen with a tastefully furnished house overlooking
Regents Park an excellent and devoted cook and housekeeper and
relatives mostly settled in the Colonies Joseph Loveredge though
inexperienced girls might pass him by with a contemptuous sniff was
recognised by ladies of maturer judgment as a prize not too often dangled
before the eyes of spinsterhood Old foxesso we are assured by kind
hearted country gentlemenrather enjoy than otherwise a day with the
hounds However that may be certain it is that Joseph Loveredge
confident of himself one presumes showed no particular disinclination
to the chase Perhaps on the whole he preferred the society of his own
sex with whom he could laugh and jest with more freedom to whom he
could tell his stories as they came to him without the trouble of having
to turn them over first in his own mind but on the other hand Joey
made no attempt to avoid female company whenever it came his way and
then no cavalier could render himself more agreeable more unobtrusively
attentive Younger men stood by in envious admiration of the ease with
which in five minutes he would establish himself on terms of cosy
friendship with the brilliant beauty before whose gracious coldness they
had stood shivering for months the daring with which he would tuck under
his arm so to speak the prettiest girl in the room smooth down as if
by magic her hundred prickles and tease her out of her overwhelming
sense of her own selfimportance The secret of his success was
probably that he was not afraid of them Desiring nothing from them
beyond companionableness a reasonable amount of appreciation for his
jokeswhich without being exceptionally stupid they would have found it
difficult to withholdwith just sufficient information and intelligence
to make conversation interesting there was nothing about him by which
they could lay hold of him Of course that rendered them particularly
anxious to lay hold of him Josephs lady friends might roughly
speaking be divided into two groups the unmarried who wanted to marry
him to themselves and the married who wanted to marry him to somebody
else It would be a social disaster the latter had agreed among
themselves if Joseph Loveredge should never wed

He would make such an excellent husband for poor Bridget

Or Gladys I wonder how old Gladys really is

Such a nice kind little man

And when one thinks of the sort of men that _are_ married it does seem
such a pity

I wonder why he never has married because hes just the sort of man
youd think _would_ have married

I wonder if he ever was in love

Oh my dear you dont mean to tell me that a man has reached the age of
forty without ever being in love

The ladies would sigh

I do hope if ever he does marry it will be somebody nice Men are so
easily deceived

I shouldnt be surprised myself a bit if something came of it with
Bridget Shes a dear girl Bridgetso genuine

Well I think myself dear if its anyone its Gladys I should be so
glad to see poor dear Gladys settled

The unmarried kept their thoughts more to themselves Each one upon
reflection saw ground for thinking that Joseph Loveredge had given proof
of feeling preference for herself The irritating thing was that on
further reflection it was equally clear that Joseph Loveredge had shown
signs of preferring most of the others

Meanwhile Joseph Loveredge went undisturbed upon his way At eight
oclock in the morning Josephs housekeeper entered the room with a cup
of tea and a dry biscuit At eightfifteen Joseph Loveredge arose and
performed complicated exercises on an indiarubber pulley warranted if
persevered in to bestow grace upon the figure and elasticity upon the
limbs Joseph Loveredge persevered steadily and had done so for years
and was himself contented with the result which seeing it concerned
nobody else was all that could be desired At halfpast eight on
Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays Joseph Loveredge breakfasted on one cup
of tea brewed by himself one egg boiled by himself and two pieces of
toast the first one spread with marmalade the second with butter On
Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays Joseph Loveredge discarded eggs and
ate a rasher of bacon On Sundays Joseph Loveredge had both eggs and
bacon but then allowed himself half an hour longer for reading the
paper At ninethirty Joseph Loveredge left the house for the office of
the oldestablished journal of which he was the incorruptible and
honoured City editor At onefortyfive having left his office at one
thirty Joseph Loveredge entered the Autolycus Club and sat down to
lunch Everything else in Josephs life was arranged with similar
preciseness so far as was possible with the duties of a City editor
Monday evening Joseph spent with musical friends at Brixton Friday was
Josephs theatre night On Tuesdays and Thursdays he was open to receive
invitations out to dinner on Wednesdays and Saturdays he invited four
friends to dine with him at Regents Park On Sundays whatever the
season Joseph Loveredge took an excursion into the country He had his
regular hours for reading his regular hours for thinking Whether in
Fleet Street or the Tyrol on the Thames or in the Vatican you might
recognise him from afar by his grey frockcoat his patentleather boots
his brown felt hat his lavender tie The man was a born bachelor When
the news of his engagement crept through the smoky portals of the
Autolycus Club nobody believed it

Impossible asserted Jack Herring Ive known Joeys life for fifteen
years Every five minutes is arranged for He could never have found
the time to do it

He doesnt like women not in that way Ive heard him say so
explained Alexander the Poet His opinion is that women are the artists
of Societydelightful as entertainers but troublesome to live with

I call to mind said the Wee Laddie a story he told me in this verra
room barely three months agone Some half a dozen of them were gong home
together from the Devonshire They had had a joyous evening and one of
themJoey did not notice whichsuggested their dropping in at his place
just for a final whisky They were laughing and talking in the dining
room when their hostess suddenly appeared upon the scene in a costumeso
Joey described itthe charm of which was its variety She was a nice
looking woman Joey said but talked too much and when the first lull
occurred Joey turned to the man sitting nighest to him and who looked
bored and suggested in a whisper that it was about time they went

Perhaps you had better go assented the boredlooking man Wish I
could come with you but you see I live here

I dont believe it said Somerville the Briefless Hes been cracking
his jokes and some silly woman has taken him seriously

But the rumour grew into report developed detail lost all charm
expanded into plain recital of fact Joey had not been seen within the
Club for more than a weekin itself a deadly confirmation The question
became Who was shewhat was she like

Its none of our set or we should have heard something from her side
before now argued acutely Somerville the Briefless

Some beastly kid who will invite us to dances and forget the supper
feared Johnny Bulstrode commonly called the Babe Old men always fall
in love with young girls

Forty explained severely Peter Hope editor and part proprietor of
_Good Humour_ is not old

Well it isnt young persisted Johnny

Good thing for you Johnny if it is a girl thought Jack Herring
Somebody for you to play with I often feel sorry for you having
nobody but grownup people to talk to

They do get a bit stodgy after a certain age agreed the Babe

I am hoping said Peter it will be some sensible pleasant woman a
little over thirty He is a dear fellow Loveredge and forty is a very
good age for a man to marry

Well if Im not married before Im forty said the Babe

Oh dont you fret Jack Herring interrupted hima pretty boy like
you We will give a ball next season and bring you out if youre
goodget you off our hands in no time

It was August Joey went away for his holiday without again entering the
Club The ladys name was Henrietta Elizabeth Doone It was said by the
_Morning Post_ that she was connected with the Doones of Gloucestershire

Doones of GloucestershireDoones of Gloucestershire mused Miss
Ramsbotham Society journalist who wrote the weekly Letter to Clorinda
discussing the matter with Peter Hope in the editorial office of _Good
Humour_ Knew a Doon who kept a big secondhand store in Euston Road
and called himself an auctioneer He bought a small place in
Gloucestershire and added an e to his name Wonder if its the same

I had a cat called Elizabeth once said Peter Hope

I dont see what thats got to do with it

No of course not agreed Peter But I was rather fond of it It was
a quaint sort of animal considered as a catwould never speak to
another cat and hated being out after ten oclock at night

What happened to it demanded Miss Ramsbotham

Fell off a roof sighed Peter Hope Wasnt used to them

The marriage took place abroad at the English Church at Montreux Mr
and Mrs Loveredge returned at the end of September The Autolycus Club
subscribed to send a present of a punchbowl left cards and waited with
curiosity to see the bride But no invitation arrived Nor for a month
was Joey himself seen within the Club Then one foggy afternoon waking
after a doze with a cold cigar in his mouth Jack Herring noticed he was
not the only occupant of the smokingroom In a far corner near a
window sat Joseph Loveredge reading a magazine Jack Herring rubbed his
eyes then rose and crossed the room

I thought at first explained Jack Herring recounting the incident
later in the evening that I must be dreaming There he sat drinking
his five oclock whiskyandsoda the same Joey Loveredge I had known for
fifteen years yet not the same Not a feature altered not a hair on
his head changed yet the whole face was different the same body the
same clothes but another man We talked for half an hour he remembered
everything that Joey Loveredge had known I couldnt understand it
Then as the clock struck and he rose saying he must be home at half
past five the explanation suddenly occurred to me _Joey Loveredge was
dead_ _this was a married man_

We dont want your feeble efforts at psychological romance told him
Somerville the Briefless We want to know what you talked about Dead
or married the man who can drink whiskyandsoda must be held
responsible for his actions Whats the little beggar mean by cutting us
all in this way Did he ask after any of us Did he leave any message
for any of us Did he invite any of us to come an see him

Yes he did ask after nearly everybody I was coming to that But he
didnt leave any message I didnt gather that he was pining for old
relationships with any of us

Well I shall go round to the office tomorrow morning said Somerville
the Briefless and force my way in if necessary This is getting
mysterious

But Somerville returned only to puzzle the Autolycus Club still further
Joey had talked about the weather the state of political parties had
received with unfeigned interest all gossip concerning his old friends
but about himself his wife nothing had been gleaned Mrs Loveredge
was well Mrs Loveredges relations were also well But at present Mrs
Loveredge was not receiving

Members of the Autolycus Club with time upon their hands took up the
business of private detectives Mrs Loveredge turned out to be a
handsome welldressed lady of about thirty as Peter Hope had desired
At eleven in the morning Mrs Loveredge shopped in the neighbourhood of
the Hampstead Road In the afternoon Mrs Loveredge in a hired
carriage would slowly promenade the Park looking it was noticed with
intense interest at the occupants of other carriages as they passed but
evidently having no acquaintances among them The carriage as a general
rule would call at Joeys office at five and Mr and Mrs Loveredge
would drive home Jack Herring as the oldest friend urged by the other
members took the bull by the horns and called boldly On neither
occasion was Mrs Loveredge at home

Im damned if I go again said Jack She was in the second time I
know I watched her into the house Confound the stuckup pair of
them

Bewilderment gave place to indignation Now and again Joey would creep
a mental shadow of his former self into the Club where once every member
would have risen with a smile to greet him They gave him curt answers
and turned away from him Peter Hope one afternoon found him there
alone standing with his hands in his pockets looking out of window
Peter was fifty so he said maybe a little older men of forty were to
him mere boys So Peter who hated mysteries stepped forward with a
determined air and clapped Joey on the shoulder

I want to know Joey said Peter I want to know whether I am to go on
liking you or whether Ive got to think poorly of you Out with it

Joey turned to him a face so full of misery that Peters heart was
touched You cant tell how wretched it makes me said Joey I
didnt know it was possible to feel so uncomfortable as I have felt
during these last three months

Its the wife I suppose suggested Peter

Shes a dear girl She only has one fault

Its a pretty big one returned Peter I should try and break her of
it if I were you

Break her of it cried the little man You might as well advise me to
break a brick wall with my head I had no idea what they were like I
never dreamt it

But what is her objection to us We are clean we are fairly
intelligent

My dear Peter do you think I havent said all that and a hundred
things more A woman she gets an idea into her head and every argument
against it hammers it in further She has gained her notion of what she
calls Bohemia from the comic journals Its our own fault we have done
it ourselves Theres no persuading her that its a libel

Wont she see a few of usjudge for herself Theres Porsonwhy
Porson might have been a bishop Or SomervilleSomervilles Oxford
accent is wasted here It has no chance

It isnt only that explained Joey she has ambitions social
ambitions She thinks that if we begin with the wrong set well never
get into the right We have three friends at present and so far as I
can see are never likely to have any more My dear boy youd never
believe there could exist such bores Theres a man and his wife named
Holyoake They dine with us on Thursdays and we dine with them on
Tuesdays Their only title to existence consists in their having a
cousin in the House of Lords they claim no other right themselves He
is a widower getting on for eighty Apparently hes the only relative
they have and when he dies they talk of retiring into the country
Theres a fellow named Cutler who visited once at Marlborough House in
connection with a charity Youd think to listen to him that he had
designs upon the throne The most tiresome of them all is a noisy woman
who as far as I can make out hasnt any name at all Miss Montgomery
is on her cards but that is only what she calls herself Who she really
is It would shake the foundations of European society if known We sit
and talk about the aristocracy we dont seem to know anybody else I
tried on one occasion a little sarcasm as a correctiverecounted
conversations between myself and the Prince of Wales in which I
invariably addressed him as Teddy It sounds tall I know but those
people took it in I was too astonished to undeceive them at the time
the consequence is I am a sort of little god to them They come round me
and ask for more What am I to do I am helpless among them Ive
never had anything to do before with the really firstprize idiot the
usual type of course one knows but these if you havent met them are
inconceivable I try insulting them they dont even know I am insulting
them Short of dragging them out of their chairs and kicking them round
the room I dont see how to make them understand it

And Mrs Loveredge asked the sympathetic Peter is she

Between ourselves said Joey sinking his voice to a needless whisper
seeing he and Peter were the sole occupants of the smokingroomI
couldnt of course say it to a younger manbut between ourselves my
wife is a charming woman You dont know her

Doesnt seem much chance of my ever doing so laughed Peter

So graceful so dignified soso queenly continued the little man
with rising enthusiasm She has only one faultshe has no sense of
humour

To Peter as it has been said men of forty were mere boys

My dear fellow whatever could have induced you

I knowI know all that interrupted the mere boy Nature arranges it
on purpose Tall and solemn prigs marry little women with turnedup
noses Cheerful little fellows like myselfwe marry serious stately
women If it were otherwise the human race would be split up into
species

Of course if you were actuated by a sense of public duty

Dont be a fool Peter Hope returned the little man Im in love
with my wife just as she is and always shall be I know the woman with
a sense of humour and of the two I prefer the one without The Juno
type is my ideal I must take the rough with the smooth One cant have
a jolly chirpy Juno and wouldnt care for her if one could

Then are you going to give up all your old friends

Dont suggest it pleaded the little man You dont know how
miserable it makes methe mere idea Tell them to be patient The
secret of dealing with women I have found is to do nothing rashly The
clock struck five I must go now said Joey Dont misjudge her
Peter and dont let the others Shes a dear girl Youll like her
all of you when you know her A dear girl She only has that one
fault

Joey went out

Peter did his best that evening to explain the true position of affairs
without imputing snobbery to Mrs Loveredge It was a difficult task
and Peter cannot be said to have accomplished it successfully Anger and
indignation against Joey gave place to pity The members of the
Autolycus Club also experienced a little irritation on their own account

What does the woman take us for demanded Somerville the Briefless
Doesnt she know that we lunch with real actors and actresses that once
a year we are invited to dine at the Mansion House

Has she never heard of the aristocracy of genius demanded Alexander
the Poet

The explanation may be that possibly she has seen it feared the Wee
Laddie

One of us ought to waylay the woman argued the Babeinsist upon her
talking to him for ten minutes Ive half a mind to do it myself

Jack Herring said nothingseemed thoughtful

The next morning Jack Herring still thoughtful called at the editorial
offices of _Good Humour_ in Crane Court and borrowed Miss Ramsbothams
Debrett Three days later Jack Herring informed the Club casually that
he had dined the night before with Mr and Mrs Loveredge The Club gave
Jack Herring politely to understand that they regarded him as a liar and
proceeded to demand particulars

If I wasnt there explained Jack Herring with unanswerable logic
how can I tell you anything about it

This annoyed the Club whose curiosity had been whetted Three members
acting in the interests of the whole solemnly undertook to believe
whatever he might tell them But Jack Herrings feelings had been
wounded

When gentlemen cast a doubt upon another gentlemans veracity

We didnt cast a doubt explained Somerville the Briefless We merely
said that we personally did not believe you We didnt say we couldnt
believe you it is a case for individual effort If you give us
particulars bearing the impress of reality supported by details that do
not unduly contradict each other we are prepared to put aside our
natural suspicions and face the possibility of your statement being
correct

It was foolish of me said Jack Herring I thought perhaps it would
amuse you to hear what sort of a woman Mrs Loveredge was likesome
description of Mrs Loveredges uncle Miss Montgomery friend of Mrs
Loveredge is certainly one of the most remarkable women I have ever met
Of course that isnt her real name But as I have said it was foolish
of me These peopleyou will never meet them you will never see them
of what interest can they be to you

They had forgotten to draw down the blinds and he climbed up a lamp
post and looked through the window was the solution of the problem put
forward by the Wee Laddie

Im dining there again on Saturday volunteered Jack Herring If any
of you will promise not to make a disturbance you can hang about on the
Park side underneath the shadow of the fence and watch me go in My
hansom will draw up at the door within a few minutes of eight

The Babe and the Poet agreed to undertake the test

You wont mind our hanging round a little while in case youre thrown
out again asked the Babe

Not in the least so far as I am concerned replied Jack Herring
Dont leave it too late and make your mother anxious

Its true enough the Babe recounted afterwards The door was opened
by a manservant and he went straight in We walked up and down for half
an hour and unless they put him out the back way hes telling the
truth

Did you hear him give his name asked Somerville who was stroking his
moustache

No we were too far off explained the Babe ButIll swear it was
Jackthere couldnt be any mistake about that

Perhaps not agreed Somerville the Briefless

Somerville the Briefless called at the offices of _Good Humour_ in Crane
Court the following morning and he also borrowed Miss Ramsbothams
Debrett

Whats the meaning of it demanded the subeditor

Meaning of what

This sudden interest of all you fellows in the British Peerage

All of us

Well Herring was here last week poring over that book for half an
hour with the _Morning Post_ spread out before him Now youre doing
the same thing

Ah Jack Herring was he I thought as much Dont talk about it
Tommy Ill tell you later on

On the following Monday the Briefless one announced to the Club that he
had received an invitation to dine at the Loveredges on the following
Wednesday On Tuesday the Briefless one entered the Club with a slow
and stately step Halting opposite old Goslin the porter who had
emerged from his box with the idea of discussing the Oxford and Cambridge
boat race Somerville removing his hat with a sweep of the arm held it
out in silence Old Goslin much astonished took it mechanically
whereupon the Briefless one shaking himself free from his Inverness
cape flung it lightly after the hat and strolled on not noticing that
old Goslin unaccustomed to coats lightly and elegantly thrown at him
dropping the hat had caught it on his head and had been in the
language of the promptbook left struggling The Briefless one
entering the smokingroom lifted a chair and let it fall again with a
crash and sitting down upon it crossed his legs and rang the bell

Yere doing it verra weel remarked approvingly the Wee Laddie Yere
just fitted for it by nature

Fitted for what demanded the Briefless one waking up apparently from
a dream

For an Adelphi guest at eighteenpence the night assured him the Wee
Laddie Yere just splendid at it

The Briefless one muttering that the worst of mixing with journalists
was that if you did not watch yourself you fell into their ways drank
his whisky in silence Later the Babe swore on a copy of _Sells
Advertising Guide_ that crossing the Park he had seen the Briefless one
leaning over the railings of Rotten Row clad in a pair of new kid
gloves swinging a silverheaded cane

One morning towards the end of the week Joseph Loveredge looking twenty
years younger than when Peter had last seen him dropped in at the
editorial office of _Good Humour_ and demanded of Peter Hope how he felt
and what he thought of the present price of Emma Mines

Peter Hopes fear was that the gambling fever was spreading to all
classes of society

I want you to dine with us on Sunday said Joseph Loveredge Jack
Herring will be there You might bring Tommy with you

Peter Hope gulped down his astonishment and said he should be delighted
he thought that Tommy also was disengaged Mrs Loveredge out of town
I presume questioned Peter Hope

On the contrary replied Joseph Loveredge I want you to meet her

Joseph Loveredge removed a pile of books from one chair and placed them
carefully upon another after which he went and stood before the fire

Dont if you dont like said Joseph Loveredge but if you dont mind
you might call yourself just for the eveningsay the Duke of
Warrington

Say the what demanded Peter Hope

The Duke of Warrington repeated Joey We are rather short of dukes
Tommy can be the Lady Adelaide your daughter

Dont be an ass said Peter Hope

Im not an ass assured him Joseph Loveredge He is wintering in
Egypt You have run back for a week to attend to business There is no
Lady Adelaide so thats quite simple

But what in the name of began Peter Hope

Dont you see what Im driving at persisted Joey It was Jacks idea
at the beginning I was frightened myself at first but it is working to
perfection She sees you and sees that you are a gentleman When the
truth comes outas of course it must later onthe laugh will be
against her

You thinkyou think thatll comfort her suggested Peter Hope

Its the only way and it is really wonderfully simple We never
mention the aristocracy nowit would be like talking shop We just
enjoy ourselves You by the way I met in connection with the movement
for rational dress You are a bit of a crank fond of frequenting
Bohemian circles

I am risking something I know continued Joey but its worth it I
couldnt have existed much longer We go slowly and are very careful
Jack is Lord MountPrimrose who has taken up with antivaccination and
who never goes out into Society Somerville is Sir Francis Baldwin the
great authority on centipedes The Wee Laddie is coming next week as
Lord Garrick who married that dancinggirl Prissy Something and
started a furniture shop in Bond Street I had some difficulty at first
She wanted to send out paragraphs but I explained that was only done by
vulgar personsthat when the nobility came to you as friends it was
considered bad taste She is a dear girl as I have always told you
with only one fault A woman easier to deceive one could not wish for I
dont myself see why the truth ever need come outprovided we keep our
heads

Seems to me youve lost them already commented Peter youre
overdoing it

The more of us the better explained Joey we help each other
Besides I particularly want you in it Theres a sort of superior
Pickwickian atmosphere surrounding you that disarms suspicion

You leave me out of it growled Peter

See here laughed Joey you come as the Duke of Warrington and bring
Tommy with you and Ill write your City article

For how long snapped Peter Incorruptible City editors are not easily
picked up

Oh well for as long as you like

On that understanding agreed Peter Im willing to make a fool of
myself in your company

Youll soon get used to it Joey told him eight oclock then on
Sunday plain evening dress If you like to wear a bit of red ribbon in
your buttonhole why do so You can get it at Evans in Covent
Garden

And Tommy is the Lady

Adelaide Let her have a taste for literature then she neednt wear
gloves I know she hates them Joey turned to go

Am I married asked Peter

Joey paused I should avoid all reference to your matrimonial affairs
if I were you was Joeys advice You didnt come out of that business
too well

Oh as bad as that was I You dont think Mrs Loveredge will object
to me

I have asked her that Shes a dear broadminded girl Ive promised
not to leave you alone with Miss Montgomery and Willis has had
instructions not to let you mix your drinks

Id have liked to have been someone a trifle more respectable grumbled
Peter

We rather wanted a duke explained Joey and he was the only one that
fitted in all round

The dinner a was a complete success Tommy entering into the spirit of
the thing bought a new pair of openwork stockings and assumed a languid
drawl Peter who was growing forgetful introduced her as the Lady
Alexandra it did not seem to matter both beginning with an A She
greeted Lord MountPrimrose as Billy and asked affectionately after
his mother Joey told his raciest stories The Duke of Warrington
called everybody by their Christian names and seemed well acquainted
with Bohemian societya more amiable nobleman it would have been
impossible to discover The lady whose real name was not Miss Montgomery
sat in speechless admiration The hostess was the personification of
gracious devotion

Other little dinners equally successful followed Joeys
acquaintanceship appeared to be confined exclusively to the higher
circles of the British aristocracywith one exception that of a German
baron a short stout gentleman who talked English well but with an
accent and who when he desired to be impressive laid his right
forefinger on the right side of his nose and thrust his whole face
forward Mrs Loveredge wondered why her husband had not introduced them
sooner but was too blissful to be suspicious The Autolycus Club was
gradually changing its tone Friends could no longer recognise one
another by the voice Every corner had its solitary student practising
highclass intonation Members dropped into the habit of addressing one
another as dear chappie and discarding pipes took to cheap cigars
Many of the older _habitues_ resigned

All might have gone well to the end of time if only Mrs Loveredge had
left all social arrangements in the hands of her husbandhad not sought
to aid his efforts To a certain political gardenparty one day in the
height of the season were invited Joseph Loveredge and Mrs Joseph
Loveredge his wife Mr Joseph Loveredge at the last moment found
himself unable to attend Mrs Joseph Loveredge went alone met there
various members of the British aristocracy Mrs Joseph Loveredge
accustomed to friendship with the aristocracy felt at her ease and was
natural and agreeable The wife of an eminent peer talked to her and
liked her It occurred to Mrs Joseph Loveredge that this lady might be
induced to visit her house in Regents Park there to mingle with those
of her own class

Lord MountPrimrose the Duke of Warrington and a few others will be
dining with us on Sunday next suggested Mrs Loveredge Will not you
do us the honour of coming We are of course only simple folk
ourselves but somehow people seem to like us

The wife of the eminent peer looked at Mrs Loveredge looked round the
grounds looked at Mrs Loveredge again and said she would like to come
Mrs Joseph Loveredge intended at first to tell her husband of her
success but a little devil entering into her head and whispering to her
that it would be amusing she resolved to keep it as a surprise to be
sprung upon him at eight oclock on Sunday The surprise proved all she
could have hoped for

The Duke of Warrington having journalistic matters to discuss with
Joseph Loveredge arrived at halfpast seven wearing on his shirtfront
a silver star purchased in Eagle Street the day before for eightand
six There accompanied him the Lady Alexandra wearing the identical
ruby necklace that every night for the past six months and twice on
Saturdays John Strongheart had been falsely accused of stealing Lord
Garrick having picked up his wife Miss Ramsbotham outside the Mother
Redcap arrived with her on foot at a quarter to eight Lord
MountPrimrose together with Sir Francis Baldwin dashed up in a hansom
at sevenfifty His Lordship having lost the toss paid the fare The
Hon Harry Sykes commonly called the Babe was ushered in five minutes
later The noble company assembled in the drawingroom chatted blithely
while waiting for dinner to be announced The Duke of Warrington was
telling an anecdote about a cat which nobody appeared to believe Lord
MountPrimrose desired to know whether by any chance it might be the same
animal that every night at halfpast nine had been in the habit of
climbing up his Graces railings and knocking at his Graces door The
Honourable Harry was saying that speaking of cats he once had a sort of
terrierwhen the door was thrown open and Willis announced the Lady Mary
Sutton

Mr Joseph Loveredge who was sitting near the fire rose up Lord Mount
Primrose who was standing near the piano sat down The Lady Mary
Sutton paused in the doorway Mrs Loveredge crossed the room to greet
her

Let me introduce you to my husband said Mrs Loveredge Joey my
dear the Lady Mary Sutton I met the Lady Mary at the OMeyers the
other day and she was good enough to accept my invitation I forgot to
tell you

Mr Loveredge said he was delighted after which although as a rule a
chatty man he seemed to have nothing else to say And a silence fell

Somerville the Brieflesstill then That evening has always been
reckoned the startingpoint of his career Up till then nobody thought
he had much in himwalked up and held out his hand

You dont remember me Lady Mary said the Briefless one I met you
some years ago we had a most interesting conversationSir Francis
Baldwin

The Lady Mary stood for a moment trying apparently to recollect She was
a handsome freshcomplexioned woman of about forty with frank
agreeable eyes The Lady Mary glanced at Lord Garrick who was talking
rapidly to Lord MountPrimrose who was not listening and who could not
have understood even if he had been Lord Garrick without being aware of
it having dropped into broad Scotch From him the Lady Mary glanced at
her hostess and from her hostess to her host

The Lady Mary took the hand held out to her Of course said the Lady
Mary how stupid of me It was the day of my own wedding too You
really must forgive me We talked of quite a lot of things I remember
now

Mrs Loveredge who prided herself upon maintaining oldfashioned
courtesies proceeded to introduce the Lady Mary to her fellowguests a
little surprised that her ladyship appeared to know so few of them Her
ladyships greeting of the Duke of Warrington was accompanied it was
remarked by a somewhat curious smile To the Duke of Warringtons
daughter alone did the Lady Mary address remark

My dear said the Lady Mary how you have grown since last we met

The announcement of dinner as everybody felt came none too soon

It was not a merry feast Joey told but one story he told it three
times and twice left out the point Lord MountPrimrose took sifted
sugar with _pate de foie gras_ and ate it with a spoon Lord Garrick
talking a mixture of Scotch and English urged his wife to give up
housekeeping and take a flat in Gower Street which as he pointed out
was central She could have her meals sent in to her and so avoid all
trouble The Lady Alexandras behaviour appeared to Mrs Loveredge not
altogether wellbred An eccentric young noblewoman Mrs Loveredge had
always found her but wished on this occasion that she had been a little
less eccentric Every few minutes the Lady Alexandra buried her face in
her serviette and shook and rocked emitting stifled sounds apparently
those of acute physical pain Mrs Loveredge hoped she was not feeling
ill but the Lady Alexandra appeared incapable of coherent reply Twice
during the meal the Duke of Warrington rose from the table and began
wandering round the room on each occasion asked what he wanted had
replied meekly that he was merely looking for his snuffbox and had sat
down again The only person who seemed to enjoy the dinner was the Lady
Mary Sutton

The ladies retired upstairs into the drawingroom Mrs Loveredge
breaking a long silence remarked it as unusual that no sound of
merriment reached them from the diningroom The explanation was that
the entire male portion of the party on being left to themselves had
immediately and in a body crept on tiptoe into Joeys study which
fortunately happened to be on the ground floor Joey unlocking the
bookcase had taken out his Debrett but appeared incapable of
understanding it Sir Francis Baldwin had taken it from his unresisting
hands the remaining aristocracy huddled themselves into a corner and
waited in silence

I think Ive got it all clearly announced Sir Francis Baldwin after
five minutes which to the others had been an hour Yes I dont think
Im making any mistake Shes the daughter of the Duke of Truro married
in 53 the Duke of Warrington at St Peters Eaton Square gave birth
in 55 to a daughter the Lady Grace Alexandra Warberton Sutton which
makes the child just thirteen In 63 divorced the Duke of Warrington
Lord MountPrimrose so far as I can make out must be her second cousin
I appear to have married her in 66 at Hastings It doesnt seem to me
that we could have got together a homelier little party to meet her even
if we had wanted to

Nobody spoke nobody had anything particularly worth saying The door
opened and the Lady Alexandra otherwise Tommy entered the room

Isnt it time suggested the Lady Alexandra that some of you came
upstairs

I was thinking myself explained Joey the host with a grim smile it
was about time that I went out and drowned myself The canal is handy

Put it off till tomorrow Tommy advised him I have asked her
ladyship to give me a lift home and she has promised to do so She is
evidently a woman with a sense of humour Wait till after I have had a
talk with her

Six men whispering at the same time were prepared with advice but
Tommy was not taking advice

Come upstairs all of you insisted Tommy and make yourselves
agreeable Shes going in a quarter of an hour

Six silent men the host leading the two husbands bringing up the rear
ascended the stairs each with the sensation of being twice his usual
weight Six silent men entered the drawingroom and sat down on chairs
Six silent men tried to think of something interesting to say

Miss Ramsbothamit was that or hysterics as she afterwards
explainedstifling a sob opened the piano But the only thing she
could remember was Champagne Charlie is my Name a song then popular in
the halls Five men when she had finished begged her to go on Miss
Ramsbotham speaking in a shrill falsetto explained it was the only tune
she knew Four of them begged her to play it again Miss Ramsbotham
played it a second time with involuntary variations

The Lady Marys carriage was announced by the imperturbable Willis The
party with the exception of the Lady Mary and the hostess suppressed
with difficulty an inclination to burst into a cheer The Lady Mary
thanked Mrs Loveredge for a most interesting evening and beckoned Tommy
to accompany her With her disappearance a wild hilarity uncanny in
its suddenness took possession of the remaining guests

A few days later the Lady Marys carriage again drew up before the
little house in Regents Park Mrs Loveredge fortunately was at home
The carriage remained waiting for quite a long time Mrs Loveredge
after it was gone locked herself in her own room The underhousemaid
reported to the kitchen that passing the door she had detected sounds
indicative of strong emotion

Through what ordeal Joseph Loveredge passed was never known For a few
weeks the Autolycus Club missed him Then gradually as aided by Time
they have a habit of doing things righted themselves Joseph Loveredge
received his old friends his friends received Joseph Loveredge Mrs
Loveredge as a hostess came to have only one failinga marked coldness
of demeanour towards all people with titles whenever introduced to her




STORY THE SIXTHThe Babe applies for Shares


People said of the new journal _Good Humour_people of taste and
judgment that it was the brightest the cleverest the most literary
penny weekly that ever had been offered to the public This made Peter
Hope editor and partproprietor very happy William Clodd business
manager and also partproprietor it left less elated

Must be careful said William Clodd that we dont make it too clever
Happy medium thats the ideal

People saidpeople of taste and judgment that _Good Humour_ was more
worthy of support than all the other penny weeklies put together People
of taste and judgment even went so far some of them as to buy it Peter
Hope looking forward saw fame and fortune coming to him

William Clodd looking round about him said

Doesnt it occur to you Guvnor that were getting this thing just a
trifle too high class

What makes you think that demanded Peter Hope

Our circulation for one thing explained Clodd The returns for last
month

Id rather you didnt mention them if you dont mind interrupted
Peter Hope somehow hearing the actual figures always depresses me

Cant say I feel inspired by them myself admitted Clodd

It will come said Peter Hope it will come in time We must educate
the public up to our level

If there is one thing so far as I have noticed said William Clodd
that the public are inclined to pay less for than another it is for
being educated

What are we to do asked Peter Hope

What you want answered William Clodd is an officeboy

How will our having an officeboy increase our circulation demanded
Peter Hope Besides it was agreed that we could do without one for the
first year Why suggest more expense

I dont mean an ordinary officeboy explained Clodd I mean the sort
of boy that I rode with in the train going down to Stratford yesterday

What was there remarkable about him

Nothing He was reading the current number of the _Penny Novelist_
Over two hundred thousand people buy it He is one of them He told me
so When he had done with it he drew from his pocket a copy of the
_Halfpenny Joker_they guarantee a circulation of seventy thousand He
sat and chuckled over it until we got to Bow

But

You wait a minute Im coming to the explanation That boy represents
the reading public I talked to him The papers he likes best are the
papers that have the largest sales He never made a single mistake The
othersthose of them he had seenhe dismissed as rot What he likes
is what the great mass of the journalbuying public likes Please himI
took his name and address and he is willing to come to us for eight
shillings a weekand you please the people that buy Not the people
that glance through a paper when it is lying on the smokingroom table
and tell you it is damned good but the people that plank down their
penny Thats the sort we want

Peter Hope able editor with ideals was shockedindignant William
Clodd business man without ideals talked figures

Theres the advertiser to be thought of persisted Clodd I dont
pretend to be a George Washington but whats the use of telling lies
that sound like lies even to ones self while ones telling them Give
me a genuine sale of twenty thousand and Ill undertake without
committing myself to convey an impression of forty But when the actual
figures are under eight thousandwell it hampers you if you happen to
have a conscience

Give them every week a dozen columns of good sound literature
continued Clodd insinuatingly but wrap it up in twentyfour columns of
jam Its the only way theyll take it and you will be doing them
goodeducating them without their knowing it All powder and no jam
Well they dont open their mouths thats all

Clodd was a man who knew how to get his way Flippspelled
PhilipTweetel arrived in due course of time at 23 Crane Court
ostensibly to take up the position of _Good Humours_ officeboy in
reality and without his being aware of it to act as its literary
taster Stories in which Flipp became absorbed were accepted Peter
groaned but contented himself with correcting only their grosser
grammatical blunders the experiment should be tried in all good faith
Humour at which Flipp laughed was printed Peter tried to ease his
conscience by increasing his subscription to the fund for destitute
compositors but only partially succeeded Poetry that brought a tear to
the eye of Flipp was given leaded type People of taste and judgment
said _Good Humour_ had disappointed them Its circulation slowly but
steadily increased

See cried the delighted Clodd told you so

Its sad to think began Peter

Always is interrupted Clodd cheerfully Moraldont think too
much

Tell you what well do added Clodd Well make a fortune out of this
paper Then when we can afford to lose a little money well launch a
paper that shall appeal only to the intellectual portion of the public
Meanwhile

A squat black bottle with a label attached standing on the desk
arrested Clodds attention

When did this come asked Clodd

About an hour ago Peter told him

Any order with it

I think so Peter searched for and found a letter addressed to
William Clodd Esq Advertising Manager _Good Humour_ Clodd tore it
open hastily devoured it

Not closed up yet are you

No not till eight oclock

Good I want you to write me a par Do it now then you wont forget
it For the Walnuts and Wine column

Peter sat down headed a sheet of paper For W and W Col

What is it questioned Petersomething to drink

Its a sort of port explained Clodd that doesnt get into your
head

You consider that an advantage queried Peter

Of course You can drink more of it

Peter continued to write Possesses all the qualities of an old vintage
port without those deleterious properties I havent tasted it
Clodd hinted Peter

Thats all rightI have

And was it good

Splendid stuff Say its delicious and invigorating Theyll be sure
to quote that

Peter wrote on Personally I have found it delicious and Peter left
off writing I really think Clodd I ought to taste it You see I am
personally recommending it

Finish that par Let me have it to take round to the printers Then
put the bottle in your pocket Take it home and make a night of it

Clodd appeared to be in a mighty hurry Now this made Peter only the
more suspicious The bottle was close to his hand Clodd tried to
intercept him but was not quick enough

Youre not used to temperance drinks urged Clodd Your palate is not
accustomed to them

I can tell whether its delicious or not surely pleaded Peter who
had pulled out the cork

Its a quarterpage advertisement for thirteen weeks Put it down and
dont be a fool urged Clodd

Im going to put it down laughed Peter who was fond of his joke
Peter poured out half a tumblerful and dranksome of it

Like it demanded Clodd with a savage grin

You are sureyou are sure it was the right bottle gasped Peter

Bottles all right Clodd assured him Try some more Judge it
fairly

Peter ventured on another sip You dont think they would be satisfied
if I recommended it as a medicine insinuated Petersomething to have
about the house in case of accidental poisoning

Better go round and suggest the idea to them yourself Ive done with
it Clodd took up his hat

Im sorryIm very sorry sighed Peter But I couldnt
conscientiously

Clodd put down his hat again with a bang Oh confound that conscience
of yours Dont it ever think of your creditors Whats the use of my
working out my lungs for you when all you do is to hamper me at every
step

Wouldnt it be better policy urged Peter to go for the better class
of advertiser who doesnt ask you for this sort of thing

Go for him snorted Clodd Do you think I dont go for him They are
just sheep Get one you get the lot Until youve got the one the
others wont listen to you

Thats true mused Peter I spoke to Wilkinson of Kingsleys
myself He advised me to try and get Landors He thought that if I
could get an advertisement out of Landor he might persuade his people to
give us theirs

And if you had gone to Landor he would have promised you theirs
provided you got Kingsleys

They will come thought hopeful Peter We are going up steadily They
will come with a rush

They had better come soon thought Clodd The only things coming with
a rush just now are bills

Those articles of young McTears attracted a good deal of attention
expounded Peter He has promised to write me another series

Jowett is the one to get hold of mused Clodd Jowett all the others
follow like a flock of geese waddling after the old gander If only we
could get hold of Jowett the rest would be easy

Jowett was the proprietor of the famous Marble Soap Jowett spent on
advertising every year a quarter of a million it was said Jowett was
the stay and prop of periodical literature New papers that secured the
Marble Soap advertisement lived and prospered the new paper to which it
was denied languished and died Jowett and how to get hold of him
Jowett and how to get round him formed the chief topic of discussion at
the councilboard of most new papers _Good Humour_ amongst the number

I have heard said Miss Ramsbotham who wrote the Letter to Clorinda
that filled each week the last two pages of _Good Humour_ and that told
Clorinda who lived secluded in the country the daily history of the
highest class society among whom Miss Ramsbotham appeared to live and
have her being who they were and what they wore the wise and otherwise
things they didI have heard said Miss Ramsbotham one morning Jowett
being as usual the subject under debate that the old man is susceptible
to female influence

What I have always thought said Clodd A lady advertisingagent
might do well At all events they couldnt kick her out

They might in the end thought Peter Female doorporters would
become a profession for muscular ladies if ever the idea took root

The first one would get a good start anyhow thought Clodd

The subeditor had pricked up her ears Once upon a time long ago the
subeditor had succeeded when all other London journalists had failed
in securing an interview with a certain great statesman The subeditor
had never forgotten thisnor allowed anyone else to forget it

I believe I could get it for you said the subeditor

The editor and the businessmanager both spoke together They spoke with
decision and with emphasis

Why not said the subeditor When nobody else could get at him it
was I who interviewed Prince

Weve heard all about that interrupted the businessmanager If I
had been your father at the time you would never have done it

How could I have stopped her retorted Peter Hope She never said a
word to me

You could have kept an eye on her

Kept an eye on her When youve got a girl of your own youll know
more about them

When I have asserted Clodd Ill manage her

We know all about bachelors children sneered Peter Hope the editor

You leave it to me Ill have it for you before the end of the week
crowed the subeditor

If you do get it returned Clodd I shall throw it out thats all

You said yourself a lady advertisingagent would be a good idea the
subeditor reminded him

So she might be returned Clodd but she isnt going to be you

Why not

Because she isnt thats why

But if

See you at the printers at twelve said Clodd to Peter and went out
suddenly

Well I think hes an idiot said the subeditor

I do not often said the editor but on this point I agree with him
Cadging for advertisements isnt a womans work

But what is the difference between

All the difference in the world thought the editor

You dont know what I was going to say returned his sub

I know the drift of it asserted the editor

But you let me

I know I doa good deal too much Im going to turn over a new leaf

All I propose to do

Whatever it is youre not going to do it declared the chief Shall
be back at halfpast twelve if anybody comes

It seems to me But Peter was gone

Just like them all wailed the subeditor They cant argue when you
explain things to them they go out It does make me so mad

Miss Ramsbotham laughed You are a downtrodden little girl Tommy

As if I couldnt take care of myself Tommys chin was high up in the
air

Cheer up suggested Miss Ramsbotham Nobody ever tells me not to do
anything I would change with you if I could

Id have walked into that office and have had that advertisement out of
old Jowett in five minutes I know I would bragged Tommy I can
always get on with old men

Only with the old ones queried Miss Ramsbotham

The door opened Anybody in asked the face of Johnny Bulstrode
appearing in the jar

Cant you see they are snapped Tommy

Figure of speech explained Johnny Bulstrode commonly called the
Babe entering and closing the door behind him

What do you want demanded the subeditor

Nothing in particular replied the Babe

Wrong time of the day to come for it halfpast eleven in the morning
explained the subeditor

Whats the matter with you asked the Babe

Feeling very cross confessed the subeditor

The childlike face of the Babe expressed sympathetic inquiry

We are very indignant explained Miss Ramsbotham because we are not
allowed to rush off to Cannon Street and coax an advertisement out of old
Jowett the soap man We feel sure that if we only put on our best hat
he couldnt possibly refuse us

No coaxing required thought the subeditor Once get in to see the
old fellow and put the actual figures before him he would clamour to
come in

Wont he see Clodd asked the Babe

Wont see anybody on behalf of anything new just at present
apparently answered Miss Ramsbotham It was my fault I was foolish
enough to repeat that I had heard he was susceptible to female charm
They say it was Mrs Sarkitt that got the advertisement for _The Lamp_
out of him But of course it may not be true

Wish I was a soap man and had got advertisements to give away sighed
the Babe

Wish you were agreed the subeditor

You should have them all Tommy

My name corrected him the subeditor is Miss Hope

I beg your pardon said the Babe I dont know how it is but one
gets into the way of calling you Tommy

I will thank you said the subeditor to get out of it

I am sorry said the Babe

Dont let it occur again said the subeditor

The Babe stood first on one leg and then on the other but nothing seemed
to come of it Well said the Babe I just looked in thats all
Nothing I can do for you

Nothing thanked him the subeditor

Good morning said the Babe

Good morning said the subeditor

The childlike face of the Babe wore a chastened expression as it slowly
descended the stairs Most of the members of the Autolycus Club looked
in about once a day to see if they could do anything for Tommy Some of
them had luck Only the day before Porsona heavy most uninteresting
manhad been sent down all the way to Plaistow to inquire after the
wounded hand of a machineboy Young Alexander whose poetry some people
could not even understand had been commissioned to search London for a
secondhand edition of Maitlands _Architecture_ Since a fortnight
nearly now when he had been sent out to drive away an organ that would
not go Johnny had been given nothing

Johnny turned the corner into Fleet Street feeling bitter with his lot A
boy carrying a parcel stumbled against him

Beg yer pardon the small boy looked up into Johnnys face miss
added the small boy dodging the blow and disappearing into the crowd

The Babe by reason of his childlike face was accustomed to insults of
this character but today it especially irritated him Why at twenty
two could he not grow even a moustache Why was he only five feet five
and a half Why had Fate cursed him with a pinkandwhite complexion so
that the members of his own club had nicknamed him the Babe while
streetboys as they passed pleaded with him for a kiss Why was his very
voice a flutelike alto more suitableSuddenly an idea sprang to life
within his brain The idea grew Passing a barbers shop Johnny went
in

Air cut sir remarked the barber fitting a sheet round Johnnys
neck

No shave corrected Johnny

Beg pardon said the barber substituting a towel for the sheet Do
you shave up sir later demanded the barber

Yes answered Johnny

Pleasant weather we are having said the barber

Very assented Johnny

From the barbers Johnny went to Stinchcombes the costumiers in
Drury Lane

I am playing in a burlesque explained the Babe I want you to rig me
out completely as a modern girl

Peeth o luck said the shopman Goth the very bundle for you Juth
come in

I shall want everything explained the Babe from the boots to the
hat stays petticoatsthe whole bag of tricks

Regular troutheau there said the shopman emptying out the canvas bag
upon the counter Thry em on

The Babe contented himself with trying on the costume and the boots

Juth made for you said the shopman

A little loose about the chest suggested the Babe

Thaths all right said the shopman Couple o thmall towelths all
thaths wanted

You dont think it too showy queried the Babe

Thowy Sthylish thaths all

You are sure everythings here

Everythinkth there Thept the bit o meat inthide assured him the
shopman

The Babe left a deposit and gave his name and address The shopman
promised the things should be sent round within an hour The Babe who
had entered into the spirit of the thing bought a pair of gloves and a
small reticule and made his way to Bow Street

I want a womans light brown wig said the Babe to Mr Cox the
perruquier

Mr Cox tried on two The deceptive appearance of the second Mr Cox
pronounced as perfect

Looks more natural on you than your own hair blessed if it doesnt
said Mr Cox

The wig also was promised within the hour The spirit of completeness
descended upon the Babe On his way back to his lodgings in Great Queen
Street he purchased a ladylike umbrella and a veil

Now a quarter of an hour after Johnny Bulstrode had made his exit by the
door of Mr Stinchcombes shop one Harry Bennett actor and member of
the Autolycus Club pushed it open and entered The shop was empty
Harry Bennett hammered with his stick and waited A piledup bundle of
clothes lay upon the counter a sheet of paper with a name and address
scrawled across it rested on the bundle Harry Bennett given to idle
curiosity approached and read the same Harry Bennett with his stick
poked the bundle scattering its items over the counter

Donth do thath said the shopman coming up Juth been putting em
together

What the devil said Harry Bennett is Johnny Bulstrode going to do
with that rigout

How thoud I know answered the shopman Private theathricals I
suppoth Friend o yourth

Yes replied Harry Bennett By Jove he ought to make a good girl
Should like to see it

Well arthk him for a ticket Donth make em dirty suggested the
shopman

I must said Harry Bennett and talked about his own affairs

The rigout and the wig did not arrive at Johnnys lodgings within the
hour as promised but arrived there within three hours which was as much
as Johnny had expected It took Johnny nearly an hour to dress but at
last he stood before the plateglass panel of the wardrobe transformed
Johnny had reason to be pleased with the result A tall handsome girl
looked back at him out of the glassa little showily dressed perhaps
but decidedly _chic_

Wonder if I ought to have a cloak mused Johnny as a ray of sunshine
streaming through the window fell upon the image in the glass Well
anyhow I havent thought Johnny as the sunlight died away again so
its no good thinking about it

Johnny seized his reticule and his umbrella and opened cautiously the
door Outside all was silent Johnny stealthily descended in the
passage paused again Voices sounded from the basement Feeling like an
escaped burglar Johnny slipped the latch of the big door and peeped out
A policeman pasting turned and looked at him Johnny hastily drew back
and closed the door again Somebody was ascending from the kitchen
Johnny caught between two terrors nearer to the front door than to the
stairs having no time chose the street It seemed to Johnny that the
street was making for him A woman came hurriedly towards him What was
she going to say to him What should he answer her To his surprise she
passed him hardly noticing him Wondering what miracle had saved him
he took a few steps forward A couple of young clerks coming up from
behind turned to look at him but on encountering his answering stare of
angry alarm appeared confused and went their way It began to dawn upon
him that mankind was less discerning than he had feared Gaining courage
as he proceeded he reached Holborn Here the larger crowd swept around
him indifferent

I beg your pardon said Johnny coming into collision with a stout
gentleman

My fault replied the stout gentleman as smiling he picked up his
damaged hat

I beg your pardon repeated Johnny again two minutes later colliding
with a tall young lady

Should advise you to take something for that squint of yours remarked
the tall young lady with severity

Whats the matter with me thought Johnny Seems to be a sort of
mist The explanation flashed across him Of course said Johnny to
himself its this confounded veil

Johnny decided to walk to the Marble Soap offices Ill be more used to
the hang of things by the time I get there if I walk thought Johnny
Hope the old beggars in

In Newgate Street Johnny paused and pressed his hands against his chest
Funny sort of pain Ive got thought Johnny Wonder if I should shock
them if I went in somewhere for a drop of brandy

It dont get any better reflected Johnny with some alarm on reaching
the corner of Cheapside Hope Im not going to be ill Whatever The
explanation came to him Of course its these damned stays No wonder
girls are shorttempered at times

At the offices of the Marble Soap Johnny was treated with marked
courtesy Mr Jowett was out was not expected back till five oclock
Would the lady wait or would she call again The lady decided now she
was there to wait Would the lady take the easychair Would the lady
have the window open or would she have it shut Had the lady seen _The
Times_

Or the _Hapenny Joker_ suggested a junior clerk who thereupon was
promptly sent back to his work

Many of the senior clerks had occasion to pass through the waitingroom
Two of the senior clerks held views about the weather which they appeared
wishful to express at length Johnny began to enjoy himself This thing
was going to be good fun By the time the slamming of doors and the
hurrying of feet announced the advent of the chief Johnny was looking
forward to his interview

It was briefer and less satisfactory than he had anticipated Mr Jowett
was very busydid not as a rule see anybody in the afternoon but of
course a ladyWould Miss

Montgomery

Would Miss Montgomery inform Mr Jowett what it was he might have the
pleasure of doing for her

Miss Montgomery explained

Mr Jowett seemed half angry half amused

Really said Mr Jowett this is hardly playing the game Against our
fellowmen we can protect ourselves but if the ladies are going to
attack usreally it isnt fair

Miss Montgomery pleaded

Ill think it over was all that Mr Jowett could be made to promise
Look me up again

When asked Miss Montgomery

Whats todayThursday Say Monday Mr Jowett rang the bell Take
my advice said the old gentleman laying a fatherly hand on Johnnys
shoulder leave business to us men You are a handsome girl You can
do better for yourself than this

A clerk entered Johnny rose

On Monday next then Johnny reminded him

At four oclock agreed Mr Jowett Good afternoon

Johnny went out feeling disappointed and yet as he told himself he
hadnt done so badly Anyhow there was nothing for it but to wait till
Monday Now he would go home change his clothes and get some dinner
He hailed a hansom

Number twentyeightno Stop at the Queens Street corner of Lincolns
Inn Fields Johnny directed the man

Quite right miss commented the cabman pleasantly Corners
bestsaves all talk

What do you mean demanded Johnny

No offence miss answered the man We was all young once

Johnny climbed in At the corner of Queen Street and Lincolns Inn
Fields Johnny got out Johnny who had been pondering other matters
put his hand instinctively to where speaking generally his pocket
should have been then recollected himself

Let me see did I think to bring any money out with me or did I not
mused Johnny as he stood upon the kerb

Look in the ridicule miss suggested the cabman

Johnny looked It was empty

Perhaps I put it in my pocket thought Johnny

The cabman hitched his reins to the whipsocket and leant back

Its somewhere about here I know I saw it Johnny told himself
Sorry to keep you waiting Johnny added aloud to the cabman

Dont you worry about that miss replied the cabman civilly we are
used to it A shilling a quarter of an hour is what we charge

Of all the damned silly tricks muttered Johnny to himself

Two small boys and a girl carrying a baby paused interested

Go away told them the cabman Youll have troubles of your own one
day

The urchins moved a few steps further then halted again and were joined
by a slatternly woman and another boy

Got it cried Johnny unable to suppress his delight as his hand
slipped through a fold The lady with the baby without precisely
knowing why set up a shrill cheer Johnnys delight died away it
wasnt the pockethole Short of taking the skirt off and turning it
inside out it didnt seem to Johnny that he ever would find that pocket

Then in that moment of despair he came across it accidentally It was as
empty as the reticule

I am sorry said Johnny to the cabman but I appear to have come out
without my purse

The cabman said he had heard that tale before and was making
preparations to descend The crowd now numbering eleven looked
hopeful It occurred to Johnny later that he might have offered his
umbrella to the cabman at least it would have fetched the eighteenpence
One thinks of these things afterwards The only idea that occurred to
him at the moment was that of getting home

Ere old my orse a minute one of yer shouted the cabman

Half a dozen willing hands seized the dozing steed and roused it into
madness

Hi stop er roared the cabman

Shes down shouted the excited crowd

Tripped over er skirt explained the slatternly woman They do
amper you

No shes not Shes up again vociferated a delighted plumber with a
sounding slap on his own leg Gor blimy if she aint a good un

Fortunately the Square was tolerably clear and Johnny a good runner
Holding now his skirt and petticoat high in his left hand Johnny moved
across the Square at the rate of fifteen miles an hour A butchers boy
sprang in front of him with arms held out to stop him The thing that
for the next three months annoyed that butcher boy most was hearing
shouted out after him Yah who was knocked down and run over by a lidy
By the time Johnny reached the Strand _via_ Clements Inn the hue and
cry was far behind Johnny dropped his skirts and assumed a more girlish
pace Through Bow Street and Long Acre he reached Great Queen Street in
safety Upon his own doorstep he began to laugh His afternoons
experience had been amusing still on the whole he wasnt sorry it was
over One can have too much even of the best of jokes Johnny rang the
bell

The door opened Johnny would have walked in had not a big rawboned
woman barred his progress

What do you want demanded the rawboned woman

Want to come in explained Johnny

What do you want to come in for

This appeared to Johnny a foolish question On reflection he saw the
sense of it This rawboned woman was not Mrs Pegg his landlady Some
friend of hers he supposed

Its all right said Johnny I live here Left my latchkey at home
thats all

Theres no females lodging here declared the rawboned lady And
whats more theres going to be none

All this was very vexing Johnny in his joy at reaching his own
doorstep had not foreseen these complications Now it would be
necessary to explain things He only hoped the story would not get round
to the fellows at the club

Ask Mrs Pegg to step up for a minute requested Johnny

Not at ome explained the rawboned lady

Notnot at home

Gone to Romford if you wish to know to see her mother

Gone to Romford

I said Romford didnt I retorted the rawboned lady tartly

Whatwhat time do you expect her in

Sunday evening six oclock replied the rawboned lady

Johnny looked at the rawboned lady imagined himself telling the raw
boned lady the simple unvarnished truth and the rawboned ladys utter
disbelief of every word of it An inspiration came to his aid

I am Mr Bulstrodes sister said Johnny meekly hes expecting me

Thought you said you lived here reminded him the rawboned lady

I meant that he lived here replied poor Johnny still more meekly He
has the second floor you know

I know replied the rawboned lady Not in just at present

Not in

Went out at three oclock

Ill go up to his room and wait for him said Johnny

No you wont said the rawboned lady

For an instant it occurred to Johnny to make a dash for it but the raw
boned lady looked both formidable and determined There would be a big
disturbanceperhaps the police called in Johnny had often wanted to
see his name in print in connection with this affair he somehow felt he
didnt

Do let me in Johnny pleaded I have nowhere else to go

You have a walk and cool yourself suggested the rawboned lady Dont
expect he will be long

But you see

The rawboned lady slammed the door

Outside a restaurant in Wellington Street from which proceeded savoury
odours Johnny paused and tried to think

What the devil did I do with that umbrella I had itno I didnt
Must have dropped it I suppose when that silly ass tried to stop me By
Jove I am having luck

Outside another restaurant in the Strand Johnny paused again How am I
to live till Sunday night Where am I to sleep If I telegraph
homedamn it how can I telegraph I havent got a penny This is
funny said Johnny unconsciously speaking aloud upon my word this is
funny Oh you go to

Johnny hurled this last at the head of an overgrown errandboy whose
intention had been to offer sympathy

Well I never commented a passing flowergirl Calls erself a lidy
I suppose

Nowadays observed the stud and button merchant at the corner of Exeter
Street they make em out of anything

Drawn by a notion that was forming in his mind Johnny turned his steps
up Bedford Street Why not mused Johnny Nobody else seems to have
a suspicion Why should they Ill never hear the last of it if they
find me out But why should they find me out Well somethings got to
be done

Johnny walked on quickly At the door of the Autolycus Club he was
undecided for a moment then took his courage in both hands and plunged
through the swing doors

Is Mr HerringMr Jack Herringhere

Find him in the smokingroom Mr Bulstrode answered old Goslin who
was reading the evening paper

Oh would you mind asking him to step out a moment

Old Goslin looked up took off his spectacles rubbed them put them on
again

Please say Miss BulstrodeMr Bulstrodes sister

Old Goslin found Jack Herring the centre of an earnest argument on
Hamletwas he really mad

A lady to see you Mr Herring announced old Goslin

A what

Miss BulstrodeMr Bulstrodes sister Shes waiting in the hall

Never knew he had a sister said Jack Herring rising

Wait a minute said Harry Bennett Shut that door Dont go This
to old Goslin who closed the door and returned Lady in a heliotrope
dress with a lace collar three flounces on the skirt

Thats right Mr Bennett agreed old Goslin

Its the Babe himself asserted Harry Bennett

The question of Hamlets madness was forgotten

Was in at Stinchcombes this morning explained Harry Bennett saw the
clothes on the counter addressed to him Thats the identical frock
This is just a try onthinks hes going to have a lark with us

The Autolycus Club looked round at itself

I can see verra promising possibilities in this provided the thing is
properly managed said the Wee Laddie after a pause

So can I agreed Jack Herring Keep where you are all of you
Twould be a pity to fool it

The Autolycus Club waited Jack Herring reentered the room

One of the saddest stories I have ever heard in all my life explained
Jack Herring in a whisper Poor girl left Derbyshire this morning to
come and see her brother found him outhasnt been seen at his lodgings
since three oclock fears something may have happened to him Landlady
gone to Romford to see her mother strange woman in charge wont let her
in to wait for him

How sad it is when trouble overtakes the innocent and helpless
murmured Somerville the Briefless

Thats not the worst of it continued Jack The dear girl has been
robbed of everything she possesses even of her umbrella and hasnt got
a _sou_ hasnt had any dinner and doesnt know where to sleep

Sounds a bit elaborate thought Porson

I think I can understand it said the Briefless one What has
happened is this Hes dressed up thinking to have a bit of fun with us
and has come out forgetting to put any money or his latchkey in his
pocket His landlady may have gone to Romford or may not In any case
he would have to knock at the door and enter into explanations What
does he suggestthe loan of a sovereign

The loan of two replied Jack Herring

To buy himself a suit of clothes Dont you do it Jack Providence
has imposed this upon us Our duty is to show him the folly of indulging
in senseless escapades

I think we might give him a dinner thought the stout and sympathetic
Porson

What I propose to do grinned Jack is to take him round to Mrs
Postwhistles Shes under a sort of obligation to me It was I who got
her the post office Well leave him there for a night with
instructions to Mrs P to keep a motherly eye on him Tomorrow he
shall have his bit of fun and I guess hell be the first to get tired
of the joke

It looked a promising plot Seven members of the Autolycus Club
gallantly undertook to accompany Miss Bulstrode to her lodgings Jack
Herring excited jealousy by securing the privilege of carrying her
reticule Miss Bulstrode was given to understand that anything any of
the seven could do for her each and every would be delighted to do if
only for the sake of her brother one of the dearest boys that ever
breatheda bit of an ass though that of course he could not help
Miss Bulstrode was not as grateful as perhaps she should have been Her
idea still was that if one of them would lend her a couple of sovereigns
the rest need not worry themselves further This purely in her own
interests they declined to do She had suffered one extensive robbery
that day already as Jack reminded her London was a city of danger to
the young and inexperienced Far better that they should watch over her
and provide for her simple wants Painful as it was to refuse a lady a
beloved companions sisters welfare was yet dearer to them Miss
Bulstrodes only desire was not to waste their time Jack Herrings
opinion was that there existed no true Englishman who would grudge time
spent upon succouring a beautiful maiden in distress

Arrived at the little grocers shop in Rolls Court Jack Herring drew
Mrs Postwhistle aside

Shes the sister of a very dear friend of ours explained Jack Herring

A finelooking girl commented Mrs Postwhistle

I shall be round again in the morning Dont let her out of your sight
and above all dont lend her any money directed Jack Herring

I understand replied Mrs Postwhistle

Miss Bulstrode having despatched an excellent supper of cold mutton and
bottled beer leant back in her chair and crossed her legs

I have often wondered remarked Miss Bulstrode her eyes fixed upon the
ceiling what a cigarette would taste like

Taste nasty I should say the first time thought Mrs Postwhistle
who was knitting

Some girls so I have heard remarked Miss Bulstrode smoke
cigarettes

Not nice girls thought Mrs Postwhistle

One of the nicest girls I ever knew remarked Miss Bulstrode always
smoked a cigarette after supper Said it soothed her nerves

Wouldnt ave thought so if Id ad charge of er said Mrs
Postwhistle

I think said Miss Bulstrode who seemed restless I think I shall go
for a little walk before turning in

Perhaps it would do us good agreed Mrs Postwhistle laying down her
knitting

Dont you trouble to come urged the thoughtful Miss Bulstrode You
look tired

Not at all replied Mrs Postwhistle Feel I should like it

In some respects Mrs Postwhistle proved an admirable companion She
asked no questions and only spoke when spoken to which during that
walk was not often At the end of half an hour Miss Bulstrode pleaded
a headache and thought she would return home and go to bed Mrs
Postwhistle thought it a reasonable idea

Well its better than tramping the streets muttered Johnny as the
bedroom door was closed behind him and thats all one can say for it
Must get hold of a smoke tomorrow if I have to rob the till Whats
that Johnny stole across on tiptoe Confound it said Johnny if
she hasnt locked the door

Johnny sat down upon the bed and took stock of his position It doesnt
seem to me thought Johnny that Im ever going to get out of this
mess Johnny still muttering unfastened his stays Thank God
thats off ejaculated Johnny piously as he watched his form slowly
expanding Suppose Ill be used to them before Ive finished with
them

Johnny had a night of dreams

For the whole of next day which was Friday Johnny remained Miss
Bulstrode hoping against hope to find an opportunity to escape from his
predicament without confession The entire Autolycus Club appeared to
have fallen in love with him

Thought I was a bit of a fool myself mused Johnny where a petticoat
was concerned Dont believe these blithering idiots have ever seen a
girl before

They came in ones they came in little parties and tendered him
devotion Even Mrs Postwhistle accustomed to regard human phenomena
without comment remarked upon it

When you are all tired of it said Mrs Postwhistle to Jack Herring
let me know

The moment we find her brother explained Jack Herring of course we
shall take her to him

Nothing like looking in the right place for a thing when youve finished
looking in the others observed Mrs Postwhistle

What do you mean demanded Jack

Just what I say answered Mrs Postwhistle

Jack Herring looked at Mrs Postwhistle But Mrs Postwhistles face was
not of the expressive order

Post office still going strong asked Jack Herring

The post office as been a great elp to me admitted Mrs Postwhistle
and Im not forgetting that I owe it to you

Dont mention it murmured Jack Herring

They brought her presentsnothing very expensive more as tokens of
regard dainty packets of sweets nosegays of simple flowers bottles of
scent To Somerville Miss Bulstrode hinted that if he really did
desire to please her and wasnt merely talking through his hatMiss
Bulstrode apologised for the slang which she feared she must have
picked up from her brotherhe might give her a box of Messanis
cigarettes size No 2 The suggestion pained him Somerville the
Briefless was perhaps oldfashioned Miss Bulstrode cut him short by
agreeing that he was and seemed disinclined for further conversation

They took her to Madame Tussauds They took her up the Monument They
took her to the Tower of London In the evening they took her to the
Polytechnic to see Peppers Ghost They made a merry party wherever they
went

Seem to be enjoying themselves remarked other sightseers surprised
and envious

Girl seems to be a bit out of it remarked others more observant

Sulkylooking bit o goods I call her remarked some of the ladies

The fortitude with which Miss Bulstrode bore the mysterious disappearance
of her brother excited admiration

Hadnt we better telegraph to your people in Derbyshire suggested Jack
Herring

Dont do it vehemently protested the thoughtful Miss Bulstrode it
might alarm them The best plan is for you to lend me a couple of
sovereigns and let me return home quietly

You might be robbed again feared Jack Herring Ill go down with
you

Perhaps hell turn up tomorrow thought Miss Bulstrode Expect hes
gone on a visit

He ought not to have done it thought Jack Herring knowing you were
coming

Oh hes like that explained Miss Bulstrode

If I had a young and beautiful sister said Jack Herring

Oh lets talk of something else suggested Miss Bulstrode You make
me tired

With Jack Herring in particular Johnny was beginning to lose patience
That Miss Bulstrodes charms had evidently struck Jack Herring all of a
heap as the saying is had in the beginning amused Master Johnny
Indeedas in the seclusion of his bedchamber over the little grocers
shop he told himself with bitter selfreproachhe had undoubtedly
encouraged the man From admiration Jack had rapidly passed to
infatuation from infatuation to apparent imbecility Had Johnnys mind
been less intent upon his own troubles he might have been suspicious As
it was and after all that had happened nothing now could astonish
Johnny Thank Heaven murmured Johnny as he blew out the light this
Mrs Postwhistle appears to be a reliable woman

Now about the same time that Johnnys head was falling thus upon his
pillow the Autolycus Club sat discussing plans for their next days
entertainment

I think said Jack Herring the Crystal Palace in the morning when
its nice and quiet

To be followed by Greenwich Hospital in the afternoon suggested
Somerville

Winding up with the Moore and Burgess Minstrels in the evening thought
Porson

Hardly the place for the young person feared Jack Herring Some of
the jokes

Mr Brandram gives a reading of _Julius Caesar_ at St Georges Hall
the Wee Laddie informed them for their guidance

Hallo said Alexander the Poet entering at the moment What are you
all talking about

We were discussing where to take Miss Bulstrode tomorrow evening
informed him Jack Herring

Miss Bulstrode repeated the Poet in a tone of some surprise Do you
mean Johnny Bulstrodes sister

Thats the lady answered Jack But how do you come to know about
her Thought you were in Yorkshire

Came up yesterday explained the Poet Travelled up with her

Travelled up with her

From Matlock Bath Whats the matter with you all demanded the Poet
You all of you look

Sit down said the Briefless one to the Poet Lets talk this matter
over quietly

Alexander the Poet mystified sat down

You say you travelled up to London yesterday with Miss Bulstrode You
are sure it was Miss Bulstrode

Sure retorted the Poet Why Ive known her ever since she was a
baby

About what time did you reach London

Threethirty

And what became of her Where did she say she was going

I never asked her The last I saw of her she was getting into a cab I
had an appointment myself and wasI say whats the matter with
Herring

Herring had risen and was walking about with his head between his hands

Never mind him Miss Bulstrode is a lady of abouthow old

Eighteenno nineteen last birthday

A tall handsome sort of girl

Yes I say has anything happened to her

Nothing has happened to her assured him Somerville _Shes_ all
right Been having rather a good time on the whole

The Poet was relieved to hear it

I asked her an hour ago said Jack Herring who was still holding his
head between his hands as if to make sure it was there if she thought
she could ever learn to love me Would you say that could be construed
into an offer of marriage

The remainder of the Club was unanimously of opinion that practically
speaking it was a proposal

I dont see it argued Jack Herring It was merely in the nature of a
remark

The Club was of opinion that such quibbling was unworthy of a gentleman

It appeared to be a case for prompt action Jack Herring sat down and
then and there began a letter to Miss Bulstrode care of Mrs
Postwhistle

But what I dont understand said Alexander the Poet

Oh take him away somewhere and tell him someone moaned Jack Herring
How can I think with all this chatter going on

But why did Bennett whispered Porson

Where is Bennett demanded half a dozen fierce voices

Harry Bennett had not been seen all day

Jacks letter was delivered to Miss Bulstrode the next morning at
breakfasttime Having perused it Miss Bulstrode rose and requested of
Mrs Postwhistle the loan of half a crown

Mr Herrings particular instructions were explained Mrs Postwhistle
that above all things I was not to lend you any money

When you have read that replied Miss Bulstrode handing her the
letter perhaps you will agree with me that Herring isan ass

Mrs Postwhistle read the letter and produced the halfcrown

Better get a shave with part of it suggested Mrs Postwhistle That
is if you are going to play the fool much longer

Miss Bulstrode opened his eyes Mrs Postwhistle went on with her
breakfast

Dont tell them said Johnny not just for a little while at all
events

Nothing to do with me replied Mrs Postwhistle

Twenty minutes later the real Miss Bulstrode on a visit to her aunt in
Kensington was surprised at receiving enclosed in an envelope the
following hastily scrawled note

 Want to speak to you at once_alone_ Dont yell when you see me
 Its all right Can explain in two ticksYour loving brother
 JOHNNY

It took longer than two ticks but at last the Babe came to an end of it

When you have done laughing said the Babe

But you look so ridiculous said his sister

_They_ didnt think so retorted the Babe I took them in all right
Guess youve never had as much attention all in one day

Are you sure you took them in queried his sister

If you will come to the Club at eight oclock this evening said the
Babe Ill prove it to you Perhaps Ill take you on to a theatre
afterwardsif youre good

The Babe himself walked into the Autolycus Club a few minutes before
eight and encountered an atmosphere of restraint

Thought you were lost remarked Somerville coldly

Called away suddenlyvery important business explained the Babe
Awfully much obliged to all you fellows for all you have been doing for
my sister Shes just been telling me

Dont mention it said two or three

Awfully good of you Im sure persisted the Babe Dont know what
she would have done without you

A mere nothing the Club assured him The blushing modesty of the
Autolycus Club at hearing of their own good deeds was touching Left to
themselves they would have talked of quite other things As a matter of
fact they tried to

Never heard her speak so enthusiastically of anyone as she does of you
Jack said the Babe turning to Jack Herring

Of course you know dear boy explained Jack Herring anything I
could do for a sister of yours

I know dear boy replied the Babe I always felt it

Say no more about it urged Jack Herring

She couldnt quite make out that letter of yours this morning
continued the Babe ignoring Jacks request Shes afraid you think her
ungrateful

It seemed to me on reflection explained Jack Herring that on one or
two little matters she may have misunderstood me As I wrote her there
are days when I dont seem altogether to quite know what Im doing

Rather awkward thought the Babe

It is agreed Jack Herring Yesterday was one of them

She tells me you were most kind to her the Babe reassured him She
thought at first it was a little uncivil your refusing to lend her any
money But as I put it to her

It was silly of me interrupted Jack I see that now I went round
this morning meaning to make it all right But she was gone and Mrs
Postwhistle seemed to think I had better leave things as they were I
blame myself exceedingly

My dear boy dont blame yourself for anything You acted nobly the
Babe told him Shes coming here to call for me this evening on purpose
to thank you

Id rather not said Jack Herring

Nonsense said the Babe

You must excuse me insisted Jack Herring I dont mean it rudely
but really Id rather not see her

But here she is said the Babe taking at that moment the card from old
Goslins hand She will think it so strange

Id really rather not repeated poor Jack

It seems discourteous suggested Somerville

You go suggested Jack

She doesnt want to see me explained Somerville

Yes she does corrected him the Babe

Id forgotten she wants to see you both

If I go said Jack I shall tell her the plain truth

Do you know said Somerville Im thinking that will be the shortest
way

Miss Bulstrode was seated in the hall Jack Herring and Somerville both
thought her present quieter style of dress suited her much better

Here he is announced the Babe in triumph Heres Jack Herring and
heres Somerville Do you know I could hardly persuade them to come out
and see you Dear old Jack he always was so shy

Miss Bulstrode rose She said she could never thank them sufficiently
for all their goodness to her Miss Bulstrode seemed quite overcome Her
voice trembled with emotion

Before we go further Miss Bulstrode said Jack Herring it will be
best to tell you that all along we thought you were your brother dressed
up as a girl

Oh said the Babe so thats the explanation is it If I had only
known Then the Babe stopped and wished he hadnt spoken

Somerville seized him by the shoulders and with a sudden jerk stood him
beside his sister under the gasjet

You little brute said Somerville It was you all along And the
Babe seeing the game was up and glad that the joke had not been
entirely on one side confessed

Jack Herring and Somerville the Briefless went that night with Johnny and
his sister to the theatreand on other nights Miss Bulstrode thought
Jack Herring very nice and told her brother so But she thought
Somerville the Briefless even nicer and later under crossexamination
when Somerville was no longer briefless told Somerville so himself

But that has nothing to do with this particular story the end of which
is that Miss Bulstrode kept the appointment made for Monday afternoon
between Miss Montgomery and Mr Jowett and secured thereby the Marble
Soap advertisement for the back page of _Good Humour_ for six months at
twentyfive pounds a week




STORY THE SEVENTHDick Danvers presents his Petition


William Clodd mopping his brow laid down the screwdriver and stepping
back regarded the result of his labours with evident satisfaction

It looks like a bookcase said William Clodd You might sit in the
room for half an hour and never know it wasnt a bookcase

What William Clodd had accomplished was this he had had prepared after
his own design what appeared to be four shelves laden with works
suggestive of thought and erudition As a matter of fact it was not a
bookcase but merely a flat board the books merely the backs of volumes
that had long since found their way into the papermill This artful
deception William Clodd had screwed upon a cottage piano standing in the
corner of the editorial office of _Good Humour_ Half a dozen real
volumes piled upon the top of the piano completed the illusion As
William Clodd had proudly remarked a casual visitor might easily have
been deceived

If you had to sit in the room while she was practising mixed scales
youd be quickly undeceived said the editor of _Good Humour_ one Peter
Hope He spoke bitterly

You are not always in explained Clodd There must be hours when she
is here alone with nothing else to do Besides you will get used to it
after a while

You I notice dont try to get used to it snarled Peter Hope You
always go out the moment she commences

A friend of mine continued William Clodd worked in an office over a
pianoshop for seven years and when the shop closed it nearly ruined
his business couldnt settle down to work for want of it

Why doesnt he come here asked Peter Hope The floor above is
vacant

Cant explained William Clodd Hes dead

I can quite believe it commented Peter Hope

It was a shop where people came and practised paying sixpence an hour
and he had got to like itsaid it made a cheerful background to his
thoughts Wonderful what you can get accustomed to

Whats the good of it demanded Peter Hope

Whats the good of it retorted William Clodd indignantly Every girl
ought to know how to play the piano A nice thing if when her lover asks
her to play something to him

I wonder you dont start a matrimonial agency sneered Peter Hope
Love and marriageyou think of nothing else

When you are bringing up a young girl argued Clodd

But youre not interrupted Peter thats just what Im trying to get
out of your head It is I who am bringing her up And between
ourselves I wish you wouldnt interfere so much

You are not fit to bring up a girl

Ive brought her up for seven years without your help Shes my adopted
daughter not yours I do wish people would learn to mind their own
business

Youve done very well

Thank you said Peter Hope sarcastically Its very kind of you
Perhaps when youve time youll write me out a testimonial

up till now concluded the imperturbable Clodd A girl of eighteen
wants to know something else besides mathematics and the classics You
dont understand them

I do understand them asserted Peter Hope What do you know about
them Youre not a father

Youve done your best admitted William Clodd in a tone of patronage
that irritated Peter greatly but youre a dreamer you dont know the
world The time is coming when the girl will have to think of a
husband

Theres no need for her to think of a husband not for years retorted
Peter Hope And even when she does is strumming on the piano going to
help her

I tinkI tink said Dr Smith who had hitherto remained a silent
listener our young frent Clodd is right You haf never quite got over
your idea dat she was going to be a boy You haf taught her de tings a
boy should know

You cut her hair added Clodd

I dont snapped Peter

You let her have it cutits the same thing At eighteen she knows
more about the ancient Greeks and Romans than she does about her own
frocks

De young girl argued the doctor what is she De flower dat makes
bright for us de garden of life de gurgling brook dat murmurs by de
dusty highway de cheerful fire

She cant be all of them snapped Peter who was a stickler for style
Do keep to one simile at a time

Now you listen to plain sense said William Clodd You wantwe all
wantthe girl to be a success all round

I want her Peter Hope was rummaging among the litter on the desk It
certainly was not there Peter pulled out a drawertwo drawers I
wish said Peter Hope I wish sometimes she wasnt quite so clever

The old doctor rummaged among dusty files of papers in a corner Clodd
found it on the mantelpiece concealed beneath the hollow foot of a big
brass candlestick and handed it to Peter

Peter had one vicethe taking in increasing quantities of snuff which
was harmful for him as he himself admitted Tommy sympathetic to most
masculine frailties was severe however upon this one

You spill it upon your shirt and on your coat had argued Tommy I
like to see you always neat Besides it isnt a nice habit I do wish
dad youd give it up

I must Peter had agreed Ill break myself of it But not all at
onceit would be a wrench by degrees Tommy by degrees

So a compromise had been compounded Tommy was to hide the snuffbox It
was to be somewhere in the room and to be accessible but that was all
Peter when selfcontrol had reached the breakingpoint might try and
find it Occasionally luck helping Peter he would find it early in the
day when he would earn his own bitter selfreproaches by indulging in
quite an orgie But more often Tommys artfulness was such that he would
be compelled by want of time to abandon the search Tommy always knew
when he had failed by the air of indignant resignation with which he
would greet her on her return Then perhaps towards evening Peter
looking up would see the box open before his nose above it a pair of
reproving black eyes their severity counterbalanced by a pair of full
red lips trying not to smile And Peter knowing that only one pinch
would be permitted would dip deeply

I want her said Peter Hope feeling with his snuffbox in his hand
more confidence in his own judgment to be a sensible clever woman
capable of earning her own living and of being independent not a mere
helpless doll crying for some man to come and take care of her

A womans business asserted Clodd is to be taken care of

Some women perhaps admitted Peter but Tommy you know very well is
not going to be the ordinary type of woman She has brains she will
make her way in the world

It doesnt depend upon brains said Clodd She hasnt got the
elbows

The elbows

They are not sharp enough The last bus home on a wet night tells you
whether a woman is capable of pushing her own way in the world Tommys
the sort to get left on the kerb

Shes the sort retorted Peter to make a name for herself and to be
able to afford a cab Dont you bully me Peter sniffed
selfassertiveness from between his thumb and finger

Yes I shall Clodd told him on this particular point The poor
girls got no mother

Fortunately for the general harmony the door opened at the moment to
admit the subject of discussion

Got that _Daisy Blossom_ advertisement out of old Blatchley announced
Tommy waving triumphantly a piece of paper over her head

No exclaimed Peter How did you manage it

Asked him for it was Tommys explanation

Very odd mused Peter asked the old idiot for it myself only last
week He refused it pointblank

Clodd snorted reproof You know I dont like your doing that sort of
thing It isnt proper for a young girl

Its all right assured him Tommy hes bald

That makes no difference was Clodds opinion

Yes it does was Tommys I like them bald

Tommy took Peters head between her hands and kissed it and in doing so
noticed the telltale specks of snuff

Just a pinch my dear explained Peter the merest pinch

Tommy took up the snuffbox from the desk Ill show you where Im
going to put it this time She put it in her pocket Peters face
fell

What do you think of it said Clodd He led her to the corner Good
idea aint it

Why wheres the piano demanded Tommy

Clodd turned in delighted triumph to the others

Humbug growled Peter

It isnt humbug cried Clodd indignantly She thought it was a
bookcaseanybody would Youll be able to sit there and practise by the
hour explained Clodd to Tommy When you hear anybody coming up the
stairs you can leave off

How can she hear anything when she A bright idea occurred to Peter
Dont you think Clodd as a practical man suggested Peter
insinuatingly adopting the Socratic method that if we got her one of
those dummy pianosyou know what I mean its just like an ordinary
piano only you dont hear it

Clodd shook his head No good at all Cant tell the effect she is
producing

Quite so Then on the other hand Clodd dont you think that hearing
the effect they are producing may sometimes discourage the beginner

Clodds opinion was that such discouragement was a thing to be battled
with

Tommy who had seated herself commenced a scale in contrary motion

Well Im going across to the printers now explained Clodd taking up
his hat Got an appointment with young Grindley at three You stick to
it A spare halfhour now and then that you never miss does wonders
Youve got it in you With these encouraging remarks to Tommy Clodd
disappeared

Easy for him muttered Peter bitterly Always does have an
appointment outside the moment she begins

Tommy appeared to be throwing her very soul into the performance Passers
by in Crane Court paused regarded the firstfloor windows of the
publishing and editorial offices of _Good Humour_ with troubled looks
then hurried on

She hasremarkably firm douch shouted the doctor into Peters ear
Will see youevening Sometingsay to you

The fat little doctor took his hat and departed Tommy ceasing
suddenly came over and seated herself on the arm of Peters chair

Feeling grumpy asked Tommy

It isnt explained Peter that I mind the noise Id put up with
that if I could see the good of it

Its going to help me to get a husband dad Seems to me an odd way of
doing it but Billy says so and Billy knows all about everything

I cant understand you a sensible girl listening to such nonsense
said Peter Its that that troubles me

Dad where are your wits demanded Tommy Isnt Billy acting like a
brick Why he could go into Fleet Street to half a dozen other papers
and make five hundred a year as advertisingagentyou know he could But
he doesnt He sticks to us If my making myself ridiculous with that
tin pot they persuaded him was a piano is going to please him isnt it
common sense and sound business to say nothing of good nature and
gratitude for me to do it Dad Ive got a surprise for him Listen
And Tommy springing from the arm of Peters chair returned to the
piano

What was it questioned Tommy having finished Could you recognise
it

I think said Peter it sounded likeIt wasnt Home Sweet Home
was it

Tommy clapped her hands Yes it was Youll end by liking it
yourself dad Well have musical At Homes

Tommy have I brought you up properly do you think

No dad you havent You have let me have my own way too much You
know the proverb Good mothers make bad daughters Clodds right
youve spoilt me dad Do you remember dad when I first came to you
seven years ago a ragged little brat out of the streets that didnt
know itself whether twas a boy or a girl Do you know what I thought to
myself the moment I set eyes on you Heres a soft old juggins Ill be
all right if I can get in here It makes you smart knocking about in
the gutters and being knocked about you read faces quickly

Do you remember your cooking Tommy You had an aptitude for it
according to your own idea

Tommy laughed I wonder how you stood it

You were so obstinate You came to me as cook and housekeeper and as
cook and housekeeper and as nothing else would you remain If I
suggested any change up would go your chin into the air I dared not
even dine out too often you were such a little tyrant The only thing
you were always ready to do if I wasnt satisfied was to march out of
the house and leave me Wherever did you get that savage independence of
yours

I dont know I think it must have been from a womanperhaps she was
my mother I dont knowwho used to sit up in the bed and cough all
night it seemed to me People would come to see usladies in fine
clothes and gentlemen with oily hair I think they wanted to help us
Many of them had kind voices But always a hard look would come into her
face and she would tell them what even then I knew to be untrueit was
one of the first things I can recollectthat we had everything we
wanted that we needed no help from anyone They would go away
shrugging their shoulders I grew up with the feeling that seemed to
have been burnt into my brain that to take from anybody anything you had
not earned was shameful I dont think I could do it even now not even
from you I am useful to you dadI do help you

There had crept a terror into Tommys voice Peter felt the little hands
upon his arm trembling

Help me Why you work like a niggerlike a nigger is supposed to
work but doesnt No onewhatever we paid himwould do half as much
I dont want to make your head more swollen than it is young woman but
you have talent I am not sure it is not genius Peter felt the little
hands tighten upon his arm

I do want this paper to be a success that is why I strum upon the piano
to please Clodd Is it humbug

I am afraid it is but humbug is the sweet oil that helps this whirling
world of ours to spin round smoothly Too much of it cloys we drop it
very gently

But you are sure it is only humbug Tommy It was Peters voice into
which fear had entered now It is not that you think he understands you
better than I dowould do more for you

You want me to tell you all I think of you and that isnt good for you
dadnot too often It would be you who would have swelled head then

I am jealous Tommy jealous of everyone that comes near you Life is a
tragedy for us old folks We know there must come a day when you will
leave the nest leave us voiceless ridiculous flitting among bare
branches You will understand later when you have children of your own
This foolish talk about a husband It is worse for a man than it is for
the woman The mother lives again in her child the man is robbed of
all

Dad do you know how old I amthat you are talking terrible nonsense

He will come little girl

Yes answered Tommy I suppose he will but not for a long whileoh
not for a very long while Dont It frightens me

You Why should it frighten you

The pain It makes me feel a coward I want it to come I want to
taste life to drain the whole cup to understand to feel But that is
the boy in me I am more than half a boy I always have been But the
woman in me it shrinks from the ordeal

You talk Tommy as if love were something terrible

There are all things in it I feel it dad It is life in a single
draught It frightens me

The child was standing with her face hidden behind her hands Old Peter
always very bad at lying stood silent not knowing what consolation to
concoct The shadow passed and Tommys laughing eyes looked out again

Havent you anything to do dadoutside I mean

You want to get rid of me

Well Ive nothing else to occupy me till the proofs come in Im going
to practise hard

I think Ill turn over my article on the Embankment said Peter

Theres one thing you all of you ought to be grateful to me for
laughed Tommy as she seated herself at the piano I do induce you all
to take more fresh air than otherwise you would

Tommy left alone set herself to her task with the energy and
thoroughness that were characteristic of her Struggling with
complicated scales Tommy bent her eyes closer and closer over the pages
of _Czernys Exercises_ Glancing up to turn a page Tommy to her
surprise met the eyes of a stranger They were brown eyes their
expression sympathetic Below them looking golden with the sunlight
falling on it was a moustache and beard cut short in Vandyke fashion
not altogether hiding a pleasant mouth about the corners of which lurked
a smile

I beg your pardon said the stranger I knocked three times Perhaps
you did not hear me

No I didnt confessed Tommy closing the book of _Czernys
Exercises_ and rising with chin at an angle that to anyone acquainted
with the chart of Tommys temperament might have suggested the
advisability of seeking shelter

This is the editorial office of _Good Humour_ is it not inquired the
stranger

It is

Is the editor in

The editor is out

The subeditor suggested the stranger

I am the subeditor

The stranger raised his eyebrows Tommy on the contrary lowered hers

Would you mind glancing through that The stranger drew from his
pocket a folded manuscript It will not take you a moment I ought of
course to have sent it through the post but I am so tired of sending
things through the post

The strangers manner was compounded of dignified impudence combined with
pathetic humility His eyes both challenged and pleaded Tommy held out
her hand for the paper and retired with it behind the protection of the
big editorial desk that flanked on one side by a screen and on the other
by a formidable revolving bookcase stretched fortresslike across the
narrow room The stranger remained standing

Yes Its pretty criticised the subeditor Worth printing
perhaps not worth paying for

Not merely aa nominal sum sufficient to distinguish it from the work
of the amateur

Tommy pursed her lips Poetry is quite a drug in the market We can
get as much as we want of it for nothing

Say half a crown suggested the stranger

Tommy shot a swift glance across the desk and for the first time saw the
whole of him He was clad in a threadbare long brown ulsterlong
that is it would have been upon an ordinary man but the stranger
happening to be remarkably tall it appeared on him ridiculously short
reaching only to his knees Round his neck and tucked into his
waistcoat thus completely hiding the shirt and collar he may have been
wearing or may not was carefully arranged a blue silk muffler His
hands which were bare looked blue and cold Yet the black frockcoat
and waistcoat and French grey trousers bore the unmistakable cut of a
firstclass tailor and fitted him to perfection His hat which he had
rested on the desk shone resplendent and the handle of his silk
umbrella was an eagles head in gold with two small rubies for the eyes

You can leave it if you like consented Tommy Ill speak to the
editor about it when he returns

You wont forget it urged the stranger

No answered Tommy I shall not forget it

Her black eyes were fixed upon the stranger without her being aware of
it She had dropped unconsciously into her stocktaking attitude

Thank you very much said the stranger I will call again tomorrow

The stranger moving backward to the door went out

Tommy sat with her face between her hands _Czernys Exercises_ lay
neglected

Anybody called asked Peter Hope

No answered Tommy Oh just a man Left thisnot bad

The old story mused Peter as he unfolded the manuscript We all of
us begin with poetry Then we take to prose romances poetry doesnt
pay Finally we write articles How to be Happy though Married What
shall we do with our Daughters It is life summarised What is it all
about

Oh the usual sort of thing explained Tommy He wants half a crown
for it

Poor devil Let him have it

Thats not business growled Tommy

Nobody will ever know said Peter Well enter it as telegrams

The stranger called early the next day pocketed his halfcrown and left
another manuscriptan essay Also he left behind him his goldhandled
umbrella taking away with him instead an old alpaca thing Clodd kept in
reserve for exceptionally dirty weather Peter pronounced the essay
usable

He has a style said Peter he writes with distinction Make an
appointment for me with him

Clodd on missing his umbrella was indignant

Whats the good of this thing to me commented Clodd Sort of thing
for a dude in a pantomime The fellow must be a blithering ass

Tommy gave to the stranger messages from both when next he called He
appeared more grieved than surprised concerning the umbrellas

You dont think Mr Clodd would like to keep this umbrella in exchange
for his own he suggested

Hardly his style explained Tommy

Its very peculiar said the stranger with a smile I have been
trying to get rid of this umbrella for the last three weeks Once upon a
time when I preferred to keep my own umbrella people used to take it by
mistake leaving all kinds of shabby things behind them in exchange Now
when Id really like to get quit of it nobody will have it

Why do you want to get rid of it asked Tommy It looks a very good
umbrella

You dont know how it hampers me said the stranger I have to live
up to it It requires a certain amount of resolution to enter a cheap
restaurant accompanied by that umbrella When I do the waiters draw my
attention to the most expensive dishes and recommend me special brands of
their socalled champagne They seem quite surprised if I only want a
chop and a glass of beer I havent always got the courage to disappoint
them It is really becoming quite a curse to me If I use it to stop a
bus three or four hansoms dash up and quarrel over me I cant do
anything I want to do I want to live simply and inexpensively it will
not let me

Tommy laughed Cant you lose it

The stranger laughed also Lose it You have no idea how honest people
are I hadnt myself The whole world has gone up in my estimation
within the last few weeks People run after me for quite long distances
and force it into my handpeople on rainy days who havent got umbrellas
of their own It is the same with this hat The stranger sighed as he
took it up I am always trying to get _off_ with something reasonably
shabby in exchange for it I am always found out and stopped

Why dont you pawn them suggested the practicable Tommy

The stranger regarded her with admiration

Do you know I never thought of that said the stranger Of course
What a good idea Thank you so much

The stranger departed evidently much relieved

Silly fellow mused Tommy They wont give him a quarter of the
value and he will say Thank you so much and be quite contented It
worried Tommy a good deal that day the thought of that strangers
helplessness

The strangers name was Richard Danvers He lived the other side of
Holborn in Featherstone Buildings but much of his time came to be spent
in the offices of _Good Humour_

Peter liked him Full of promise was Peters opinion His criticism
of that article of mine on The Education of Woman showed both sense and
feeling A scholar and a thinker

Flipp the officeboy spelt Philip liked him and Flipps attitude in
general was censorial Hes all right pronounced Flipp nothing
stuckup about him Hes got plenty of sense lying hidden away

Miss Ramsbotham liked him The menthe men we think about at all
explained Miss Ramsbothammay be divided into two classes the men we
ought to like but dont and the men there is no particular reason for
our liking but that we do Personally I could get very fond of your
friend Dick There is nothing whatever attractive about him except
himself

Even Tommy liked him in her way though at times she was severe with him

If you mean a big street grumbled Tommy who was going over proofs
why not say a big street Why must you always call it a main artery

I am sorry apologised Danvers It is not my own idea You told me
to study the higherclass journals

I didnt tell you to select and follow all their faults Here it is
again Your crowd is always a hydraheaded monster your tea the cup
that cheers but not inebriates

I am afraid I am a deal of trouble to you suggested the staff

I am afraid you are agreed the subeditor

Dont give me up pleaded the staff I misunderstood you that is
all I will write English for the future

Shall be glad if you will growled the subeditor

Dick Danvers rose I am so anxious not to get what you call the sack
from here

The subeditor mollified thought the staff need be under no
apprehension provided it showed itself teachable

I have been rather a worthless fellow Miss Hope confessed Dick
Danvers I was beginning to despair of myself till I came across you
and your father The atmosphere hereI dont mean the material
atmosphere of Crane Courtis so invigorating its simplicity its
sincerity I used to have ideals I tried to stifle them There is a
set that sneers at all that sort of thing Now I see that they are good
You will help me

Every woman is a mother Tommy felt for the moment that she wanted to
take this big boy on her knee and talk to him for his good He was only
an overgrown lad But so exceedingly overgrown Tommy had to content
herself with holding out her hand Dick Danvers grasped it tightly

Clodd was the only one who did not approve of him

How did you get hold of him asked Clodd one afternoon he and Peter
alone in the office

He came He came in the usual way explained Peter

What do you know about him

Nothing What is there to know One doesnt ask for a character with a
journalist

No I suppose that wouldnt work Found out anything about him since

Nothing against him Why so suspicious of everybody

Because you are just a woolly lamb and want a dog to look after you Who
is he On a first night he gives away his stall and sneaks into the pit
When you send him to a picturegallery he dodges the private view and
goes on the first shilling day If an invitation comes to a public
dinner he asks me to go and eat it for him and tell him what its all
about That doesnt suggest the frank and honest journalist does it

It is unusual it certainly is unusual Peter was bound to admit

I distrust the man said Clodd Hes not our class What is he doing
here

I will ask him Clodd I will ask him straight out

And believe whatever he tells you

No I shant

Then whats the good of asking him

Well what am I to do demanded the bewildered Peter

Get rid of him suggested Clodd

Get rid of him

Get him away Dont have him in and out of the office all day
longlooking at her with those colliedog eyes of his arguing art and
poetry with her in that cushatdove voice of his Get him clean awayif
it isnt too late already

Nonsense said Peter who had turned white however Shes not that
sort of girl

Not that sort of girl Clodd had no patience with Peter Hope and told
him so Why are there never inkstains on her fingers now There used
to be Why does she always keep a lemon in her drawer When did she
last have her hair cut Ill tell you if you care to knowthe week
before he came five months ago She used to have it cut once a
fortnight said it tickled her neck Why does she jump on people when
they call her Tommy and tell them that her name is Jane It never used
to be Jane Maybe when youre a bit older youll begin to notice things
for yourself

Clodd jammed his hat on his head and flung himself down the stairs

Peter slipping out a minute later bought himself an ounce of snuff

Fiddlededee said Peter as he helped himself to his thirteenth pinch
Dont believe it Ill sound her I shant say a wordIll just sound
her

Peter stood with his back to the fire Tommy sat at her desk correcting
proofs of a fanciful story _The Man Without a Past_

I shall miss him said Peter I know I shall

Miss whom demanded Tommy

Danvers sighed Peter It always happens so You get friendly with a
man then he goes awayabroad back to America Lord knows where You
never see him again

Tommy looked up There was trouble in her face

How do you spell harassed questioned Tommy two rs or one

One r Peter informed her two ss

I thought so The trouble passed from Tommys face

You dont ask when hes going you dont ask where hes going
complained Peter You dont seem to be interested in the least

I was going to ask so soon as I had finished correcting this sheet
explained Tommy What reason does he give

Peter had crossed over and was standing where he could see her face
illumined by the lamplight

It doesnt upset youthe thought of his going away of your never
seeing him again

Why should it Tommy answered his searching gaze with a slightly
puzzled look Of course Im sorry He was becoming useful But we
couldnt expect him to stop with us always could we

Peter rubbing his hands broke into a chuckle I told him twas all
fiddlesticks Clodd he would have it you were growing to care for the
fellow

For Dick Danvers Tommy laughed Whatever put that into his head

Oh well there were one or two little things that we had noticed

We

I mean that Clodd had noticed

Im glad it was Clodd that noticed them not you dad thought Tommy to
herself Theyd have been pretty obvious if you had noticed them

It naturally made me anxious confessed Peter You see we know
absolutely nothing of the fellow

Absolutely nothing agreed Tommy

He may be a man of the highest integrity Personally I think he is I
like him On the other hand he may be a thoroughpaced scoundrel I
dont believe for a moment that he is but he may be Impossible to
say

Quite impossible agreed Tommy

Considered merely as a journalist it doesnt matter He writes well
He has brains Theres an end of it

He is very painstaking agreed Tommy

Personally added Peter I like the fellow Tommy had returned to
her work

Of what use was Peter in a crisis of this kind Peter couldnt scold
Peter couldnt bully The only person to talk to Tommy as Tommy knew she
needed to be talked to was one Jane a young woman of dignity with sense
of the proprieties

I do hope that at least you are feeling ashamed of yourself remarked
Jane to Tommy that same night as the twain sat together in their little
bedroom

Done nothing to be ashamed of growled Tommy

Making a fool of yourself openly for everybody to notice

Clodd aint everybody Hes got eyes at the back of his head Sees
things before they happen

Wheres your womans pride falling in love with a man who has never
spoken to you except in terms of the most ordinary courtesy

Im not in love with him

A man about whom you know absolutely nothing

Not in love with him

Where does he come from Who is he

I dont know dont care nothing to do with me

Just because of his soft eyes and his wheedling voice and that half
caressing halfdevotional manner of his Do you imagine he keeps it
specially for you I gave you credit for more sense

Im not in love with him I tell you Hes down on his luck and Im
sorry for him thats all

And if he is whose fault was it do you think

It doesnt matter We are none of us saints Hes trying to pull
himself together and I respect him for it Its our duty to be
charitable and kind to one another in this world

Oh well Ill tell you how you can be kind to him by pointing out to
him that he is wasting his time With his talents now that he knows his
business he could be on the staff of some big paper earning a good
income Put it nicely to him but be firm Insist on his going That
will be showing true kindness to himand to yourself too Im thinking
my dear

And Tommy understood and appreciated the sound good sense underlying
Janes advice and the very next day but one seizing the first
opportunity acted upon it and all would have gone as contemplated if
only Dick Danvers had sat still and listened as it had been arranged in
Tommys programme that he should

But I dont want to go said Dick

But you ought to want to go Staying here with us you are doing
yourself no good

He rose and came to where she stood with one foot upon the fender
looking down into the fire His doing this disconcerted her So long as
he remained seated at the other end of the room she was the subeditor
counselling the staff for its own good Now that she could not raise her
eyes without encountering his she felt painfully conscious of being
nothing more important than a little woman who was trembling

It is doing me all the good in the world he told her being near to
you

Oh please do sit down again she urged him I can talk to you so
much better when youre sitting down

But he would not do anything he should have done that day Instead he
took her hands in his and would not let them go and the reason and the
will went out of her leaving her helpless

Let me be with you always he pleaded It means the difference
between light and darkness to me You have done so much for me Will
you not finish your work Will you not trust me It is no hot passion
that can pass away my love for you It springs from all that is best in
mefrom the part of me that is wholesome and joyous and strong the part
of me that belongs to you

Releasing her he turned away

The other part of methe blackguardit is dead deardead and
buried I did not know I was a blackguard I thought myself a fine
fellow till one day it came home to me Suddenly I saw myself as I
really was And the sight of the thing frightened me and I ran away from
it I said to myself I would begin life afresh in a new country free
of every tie that could bind me to the past It would mean
povertyprivation maybe in the beginning What of that The struggle
would brace me It would be good sport Ah well you can guess the
result the awakening to the cold facts the reaction of feeling In
what way was I worse than other men Who was I to play the prig in a
world where others were laughing and dining I had tramped your city
till my boots were worn into holes I had but to abandon my quixotic
idealsreturn to where shame lay waiting for me to be welcomed with the
fatted calf It would have ended so had I not chanced to pass by your
door that afternoon and hear you strumming on the piano

So Billy was right after all thought Tommy to herself the piano does
help

It was so incongruousa piano in Crane CourtI looked to see where the
noise came from I read the name of the paper on the doorpost It will
be my last chance I said to myself This shall decide it

He came back to her She had not moved I am not afraid to tell you
all this You are so bighearted so human you will understand you can
forgive It is all past Loving you tells a man that he has done with
evil Will you not trust me

She put her hands in his I am trusting you she said with all my
life Dont make a muddle of it dear if you can help it

It was an odd wooing as Tommy laughingly told herself when she came to
think it over in her room that night But that is how it shaped itself

What troubled her most was that he had not been quite frank with Peter
so that Peter had to defend her against herself

I attacked you so suddenly explained Peter you had not time to
think You acted from instinct A woman seeks to hide her love even
from herself

I expect after all I am more of a girl than a boy feared Tommy I
seem to have so many womanish failings

Peter took himself into quite places and trained himself to face the fact
that another would be more to her than he had ever been and Clodd went
about his work like a bear with a sore head but they neither of them
need have troubled themselves so much The marriage did not take place
till nearly fifteen years had passed away and much water had to flow
beneath old London Bridge before that day

The past is not easily got rid of A tale was once written of a woman
who killed her babe and buried it in a lonely wood and later stole back
in the night and saw there white in the moonlight a childs hand
calling through the earth and buried it again and yet again but always
that white baby hand called upwards through the earth trample it down as
she would Tommy read the story one evening in an old miscellany and
sat long before the dead fire the book open on her lap and shivered
for now she knew the fear that had been haunting her

Tommy lived expecting her She came one night when Tommy was alone
working late in the office Tommy knew her the moment she entered the
door a handsome woman with snakelike rustling skirts She closed the
door behind her and drawing forward a chair seated herself the other
side of the desk and the two looked long and anxiously at one another

They told me I should find you here alone said the woman It is
better is it not

Yes said Tommy it is better

Tell me said the woman are you very much in love with him

Why should I tell you

Because if notif you have merely accepted him thinking him a good
catchwhich he isnt my dear hasnt a penny to bless himself with and
never will if he marries youwhy then the matter is soon settled They
tell me you are a businesslike young lady and I am prepared to make a
businesslike proposition

There was no answer The woman shrugged her shoulders

If on the other hand you are that absurd creature a young girl in
lovewhy then I suppose we shall have to fight for him

It would be more sporting would it not suggested Tommy

Let me explain before you decide continued the woman Dick Danvers
left me six months ago and has kept from me ever since because he loved
me

It sounds a curious reason

I was a married woman when Dick Danvers and I first met Since he left
mefor my sake and his ownI have received information of my husbands
death

And does Dickdoes he know asked the girl

Not yet I have only lately learnt the news myself

Then if it is as you say when he knows he will go back to you

There are difficulties in the way

What difficulties

My dear this To try and forget me he has been making love to you
Men do these things I merely ask you to convince yourself of the truth
Go away for six monthsdisappear entirely Leave him freeuninfluenced
If he loves youif it be not merely a sense of honour that binds himyou
will find him here on your return If notif in the interval I have
succeeded in running off with him well is not the two or three thousand
pounds I am prepared to put into this paper of yours a fair price for
such a lover

Tommy rose with a laugh of genuine amusement She could never altogether
put aside her sense of humour let Fate come with what terrifying face it
would

You may have him for nothingif he is that man the girl told her he
shall be free to choose between us

You mean you will release him from his engagement

That is what I mean

Why not take my offer You know the money is needed It will save your
father years of anxiety and struggle Go awaytravel for a couple of
months if youre afraid of the six Write him that you must be alone
to think things over

The girl turned upon her

And leave you a free field to lie and trick

The woman too had risen Do you think he really cares for you At
the moment you interest him At nineteen every woman is a mystery When
the mood is pastand do you know how long a mans mood lasts you poor
chit Till he has caught what he is running after and has tasted
itthen he will think not of what he has won but of what he has lost
of the society from which he has cut himself adrift of all the old
pleasures and pursuits he can no longer enjoy of the
luxuriesnecessities to a man of his stampthat marriage with you has
deprived him of Then your face will be a perpetual reminder to him of
what he has paid for it and he will curse it every time he sees it

You dont know him the girl cried You know just a part of himthe
part you would know All the rest of him is a good man that would
rather his selfrespect than all the luxuries you mentionyou included

It seems to resolve itself into what manner of man he is laughed the
woman

The girl looked at her watch He will be here shortly he shall tell us
himself

How do you mean

That here between the two of us he shall decidethis very night She
showed her white face to the woman Do you think I could live through a
second day like to this

The scene would be ridiculous

There will be none here to enjoy the humour of it

He will not understand

Oh yes he will the girl laughed Come you have all the
advantages you are rich you are clever you belong to his class If he
elects to stop with me it will be because he is my manmine Are you
afraid

The woman shivered She wrapped her fur cloak about her closer and sat
down again and Tommy returned to her proofs It was pressnight and
there was much to be done

He came a little later though how long the time may have seemed to the
two women one cannot say They heard his footstep on the stair The
woman rose and went forward so that when he opened the door she was the
first he saw But he made no sign Possibly he had been schooling
himself for this moment knowing that sooner or later it must come The
woman held out her hand to him with a smile

I have not the honour he said

The smile died from her face I do not understand she said

I have not the honour he repeated I do not know you

The girl was leaning with her back against the desk in a somewhat mannish
attitude He stood between them It will always remain Lifes chief
comic success the man between two women The situation has amused the
world for so many years Yet somehow he contrived to maintain a
certain dignity

Maybe he continued you are confounding me with a Dick Danvers who
lived in New York up to a few months ago I knew him wella worthless
scamp you had done better never to have met

You bear a wonderful resemblance to him laughed the woman

The poor fool is dead he answered And he left for you my dear
lady this dying message that from the bottom of his soul he was sorry
for the wrong he had done you He asked you to forgive himand forget
him

The year appears to be opening unfortunately for me said the woman
First my lover then my husband

He had nerved himself to fight the living This was a blow from the
dead The man had been his friend

Dead

He was killed it appears in that last expedition in July answered
the woman I received the news from the Foreign Office only a fortnight
ago

An ugly look came into his eyesthe look of a cornered creature fighting
for its life Why have you followed me here Why do I find you here
alone with her What have you told her

The woman shrugged her shoulders Only the truth

All the truth he demandedall Ah be just Tell her it was not
all my fault Tell her all the truth

What would you have me tell her That I played Potiphars wife to your
Joseph

Ah no The truthonly the truth That you and I were a pair of idle
fools with the devil dancing round us That we played a fools game and
that it is over

Is it over Dick is it over She flung her arms towards him but he
threw her from him almost brutally The man is dead I tell you His
folly and his sin lie dead with him I have nothing to do with you nor
you with me

Dick she whispered Dick cannot you understand I must speak with
you alone

But they did not understand neither the man nor the child

Dick are you really dead she cried Have you no pity for me Do
you think that I have followed you here to grovel at your feet for mere
whim Am I acting like a woman sane and sound Dont you see that I am
mad and why I am mad Must I tell you before her Dick She
staggered towards him and the fine cloak slipped from her shoulders and
then it was that Tommy changed from a child into a woman and raised the
other woman from the ground with crooning words of encouragement such as
mothers use and led her to the inner room Do not go she said
turning to Dick I shall be back in a few minutes

He crossed to one of the windows against which beat the Citys roar and
it seemed to him as the throb of passing footsteps beating down through
the darkness to where he lay in his grave

She reentered closing the door softly behind her It is true she
asked

It can be I had not thought of it

They spoke in low matteroffact tones as people do who have grown
weary of their own emotions

When did he go awayher husband

Aboutit is February now is it not About eighteen months ago

And died just eight months ago Rather conveniently poor fellow

Yes Im glad he is deadpoor Lawrence

What is the shortest time in which a marriage can be arranged

I do not know he answered listlessly I do not intend to marry her

You would leave her to bear it alone

It is not as if she were a poor woman You can do anything with money

It will not mend reputation Her position in society is everything to
that class of woman

My marrying her now he pointed out would not save her

Practically speaking it would the girl pleaded The world does not
go out of its way to find out things it does not want to know Marry her
as quietly as possible and travel for a year or two

Why should I Ah it is easy enough to call a man a coward for
defending himself against a woman What is he to do when he is fighting
for his life Men do not sin with good women

There is the child to be considered she urgedyour child You see
dear we all do wrong sometimes We must not let others suffer for our
fault moremore than we can help

He turned to her for the first time And you

I Oh I shall cry for a little while but later on I shall laugh as
often Life is not all love I have my work

He knew her well by this time And also it came to him that it would be
a finer thing to be worthy of her than even to possess her

So he did her bidding and went out with the other woman Tommy was glad
it was pressnight She would not be able to think for hours to come
and then perhaps she would be feeling too tired Work can be very
kind

Were this an artistic story here of course one would write Finis
But in the workaday world one never knows the ending till it comes Had
it been otherwise I doubt I could have found courage to tell you this
story of Tommy It is not all trueat least I do not suppose so One
drifts unconsciously a little way into dreamland when one sits oneself
down to recall the happenings of long ago while Fancy with a sly wink
whispers ever and again to Memory Let me tell this incidentpicture
that scene I can make it so much more interesting than you would But
Tommyhow can I put it without saying too much there is someone I think
of when I speak of her To remember only her dear wounds and not the
healing of them would have been a task too painful I love to dwell on
their next meeting Flipp passing him on the steps did not know him
the tall sunburnt gentleman with the sweet gravefaced little girl

Seen that face somewhere before mused Flipp as at the corner of
Bedford Street he climbed into a hansom seen it somewhere on a thinner
man

For Dick Danvers that he did not recognise Flipp there was more excuse
A very old young man had Flipp become at thirty Flipp no longer enjoyed
popular journalism He produced it

The goldbound doorkeeper feared the mighty Clodd would be unable to see
so insignificant an atom as an unappointed stranger but would let the
card of Mr Richard Danvers plead for itself To the goldbound keepers
surprise came down the message that Mr Danvers was to be at once shown
up

I thought somehow you would come to me first said the portly Clodd
advancing with outstretched hand And this is

My little girl Honor We have been travelling for the last few
months

Clodd took the grave small face between his big rough hands

Yes She is like you But looks as if she were going to have more
sense Forgive me I knew your father my dear laughed Clodd when he
was younger

They lit their cigars and talked

Well not exactly dead we amalgamated it winked Clodd in answer to
Danvers inquiry It was just a trifle _too_ highclass Besides the
old gentleman was not getting younger It hurt him a little at first
But then came Tommys great success and that has reconciled him to all
things Do they know you are in England

No explained Danvers we arrived only last night

Clodd called directions down the speakingtube

You will find hardly any change in her One still has to keep ones eye
upon her chin She has not even lost her old habit of taking stock of
people You remember Clodd laughed

They talked a little longer till there came a whistle and Clodd put his
ear to the tube

I have to see her on business said Clodd rising you may as well
come with me They are still in the old place Gough Square

Tommy was out but Peter was expecting her every minute

Peter did not know Dick but would not admit it Forgetfulness was a
sign of age and Peter still felt young

I know your face quite well said Peter cant put a name to it
thats all

Clodd whispered it to him together with information bringing history up
to date And then light fell upon the old lined face He came towards
Dick meaning to take him by both hands but perhaps because he had
become somewhat feeble he seemed glad when the younger man put his arms
around him and held him for a moment It was unEnglish and both of
them felt a little ashamed of themselves afterwards

What we want said Clodd addressing Peter we threeyou I and Miss
Danversis tea and cakes with cream in them and I know a shop where
they sell them We will call back for your father in half an hour
Clodd explained to Miss Danvers he has to talk over a matter of
business with Miss Hope

I know answered the gravefaced little person She drew Dicks face
down to hers and kissed it And then the three went out together
leaving Dick standing by the window

Couldnt we hide somewhere till she comes suggested Miss Danvers I
want to see her

So they waited in the open doorway of a near printinghouse till Tommy
drove up Both Peter and Clodd watched the childs face with some
anxiety She nodded gravely to herself three times then slipped her
hand into Peters

Tommy opened the door with her latchkey and passed in
