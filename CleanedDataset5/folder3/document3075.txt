 SIR THOMAS BROWNE





CHAPTER ONE

The churchyard in which Arthur Lawford found himself wandering that mild
and golden September afternoon was old green and refreshingly still
The silence in which it lay seemed as keen and mellow as the lightthe
pale almost heatless sunlight that filled the air Here and there
robins sang across the stones elvishly shrill in the quiet of harvest
The only other living creature there seemed to Lawford to be his own
rather fair not insubstantial rather languid self who at the noise
of the birds had raised his head and glanced as if between content and
incredulity across his still and solitary surroundings An increasing
inclination for such lonely ramblings together with the feeling that
his continued illhealth had grown a little irksome to his wife and
that now that he was really better she would be relieved at his absence
had induced him to wander on from home without much considering where
the quiet lanes were leading him And in spite of a peculiar melancholy
that had welled up into his mind during these last few days he had
certainly smiled with a faint sense of the irony of things on lifting
his eyes in an unusually depressed moodiness to find himself looking
down on the shadows and peace of Widderstone

With that anxious irresolution which illness so often brings in its
train he had hesitated for a few minutes before actually entering the
graveyard But once safely within he had begun to feel extremely loth to
think of turning back again and this not the less at remembering with
a real foreboding that it was now drawing towards evening that another
day was nearly done He trailed his umbrella behind him over the
grassgrown paths staying here and there to read some timeworn
inscription stooping a little broodingly over the dark green graves
Not for the first time during the long laborious convalescence that had
followed apparently so slight an indisposition a fleeting sense almost
as if of an unintelligible remorse had overtaken him a vague thought
that behind all these past years hidden as it were from his daily life
lay something not yet quite reckoned with How often as a boy had he
been rapped into a galvanic activity out of the deep reveries he used
to fall intothose fits of a kind of fishlike daydream How often
and even far beyond boyhood had he found himself bent on some distant
thought or fleeting vision that the sudden clash of selfpossession had
made to seem quite illusory and yet had left so strangely haunting And
now the old habit had stirred out of its long sleep and through the
gate that Influenza in departing had left ajar had returned upon him

But I suppose we are all pretty much the same if we only knew it he
had consoled himself We keep our crazy side to ourselves thats all
We just go on for years and years doing and saying whatever happens to
come upand really keen about it toohe had glanced up with a kind of
challenge in his face at the squat little belfryand then without
the slightest reason or warning down you go and it all begins to wear
thin and you get wondering what on earth it all means Memory slipped
back for an instant to the life that in so unusual a fashion seemed
to have floated a little aloof Fortunately he had not discussed these
inward symptoms with his wife How surprised Sheila would be to see him
loafing in this old crooked churchyard How she would lift her dark
eyebrows with that handsome indifferent tolerance He smiled but a
little confusedly yet the thought gave even a spice of adventure to the
evenings ramble

He loitered on scarcely thinking at all now stooping here and there
These faint listless ideas made no more stir than the sunlight gilding
the fading leaves the crisp turf underfoot With a slight effort he
stooped even once again

 Stranger a moment pause and stay
 In this dim chamber hidden away
 Lies one who once found life as dear
 As now he finds his slumbers here
 Pray then the Judgement but increase
 His deep everlasting peace

But then do you know you lie at peace Lawford audibly questioned
gazing at the doggerel And yet as his eyes wandered over the blunt
green stone and the rambling crimsonberried brier that had almost
encircled it with its thorns the echo of that whisper rather jarred
He was he supposed rather a dull creatureat least people seemed
to think soand he seldom felt at ease even with his own small
facetiousness Besides just that kind of question was getting
very common Now that cleverness was the fashion most people were
clevereven perfect fools and cleverness after all was often only
a bore all head and no body He turned languidly to the small
crossshaped stone on the other side

 Here lies the body of Ann Hard who died in childbed
 Also of James her infant son

He muttered the words over with a kind of mournful bitterness Thats
just itjust it thats just how it goes He yawned softly the
pathway had come to an end Beyond him lay ranker grass one and
another obscurer mounds an old scarred oak seat shadowed by a few
everlastingly green cypresses and coralfruited yewtrees And above and
beyond all hung a pale blue arch of sky with a few voyaging clouds like
silvered wool and the calm wide curves of stubble field and pasture
land He stood with vacant eyes not in the least aware how queer a
figure he made with his gloves and his umbrella and his hat among the
stained and tottering gravestones Then just to linger out his hour
and half sunken in reverie he walked slowly over to the few solitary
graves beneath the cypresses

One only was commemorated with a tombstone a rather unusual ovalheaded
stone carved at each corner into what might be the heads of angels
or of pagan dryads blindly facing each other with wornout sightless
faces A low curved granite canopy arched over the grave with a crevice
so wide between its stones that Lawford actually bent down and slid in
his gloved fingers between them He straightened himself with a
sigh and followed with extreme difficulty the wellnigh illegible
inscription

 Here lie ye Bones of one
 Nicholas Sabathier a Stranger to this Parish
 who fell by his own Hand on ye
 Eve of Ste Michael and All Angels
 MDCCXXXIX

Of the date he was a little uncertain The Hand had lost its n and
d and all the Angels rain had erased He was not quite sure even
of the Stranger There was a great rich S and the twisted tail of
a g and whether or not Lawford smilingly thought he is no Stranger
now But how rare and how memorable a name French evidently probably
Huguenot And the Huguenots he remembered vaguely were a rather
remarkable crowd He had he thought even played at Huguenots
once What was the mans name Coligny yes of course Coligny And I
suppose Lawford continued muttering to himself I suppose this poor
beggar was put here out of the way They might you know he added
confidentially raising the ferrule of his umbrella they might have
stuck a stake through you and buried you at the crossroads And
again a feeling of ennui a faint disgust at his poor little witticism
clouded over his mind It was a pity thoughts always ran the easiest
way like water in old ditches

Here lie ye bones of one Nicholas Sabathier he began murmuring
againmerely bones mind you brains and heart are quite another
story And its pretty certain the fellow had some kind of brains
Besides poor devil he killed himself That seems to hint at brains
Oh for goodness sake he cried out so loud that the sound of his
voice alarmed even a robin that had perched on a twig almost within
touch with glittering eye intent above its dim red breast on this other
and even rarer stranger

I wonder if it is XXXIX it might be LXXIX Lawford cast a cautious
glance over his round grey shoulder then laboriously knelt down beside
the stone and peeped into the gaping cranny There he encountered
merely the tiny palegreen faintly conspicuous eyes of a large spider
confronting his own It was for the moment an alarming and yet a
faintly fascinating experience The little almost colourless fires
remained so changeless But still even when at last they had actually
vanished into the recesses of that quiet habitation Lawford did not
rise from his knees An utterly unreasonable feeling of dismay a sudden
weakness and weariness had come over him

What is the good of it all he asked himself inconsequentlythis
monotonous restless stupid life to which he was soon to be returning
and for good He began to realize how ludicrous a spectacle he must be
kneeling here amid the weeds and grass beneath the solemn cypresses
Well you cant have everything seemed loosely to express his
disquiet

He stared vacantly at the green and fretted gravestone dimly aware that
his heart was beating with an unusual effort He felt ill and weak He
leant his hand on the stone and lifted himself on to the low wooden
seat nearby He drew off his glove and thrust his bare hand under his
waistcoat with his mouth a little ajar and his eyes fixed on the dark
square turret its bell sharply defined against the evening sky

Dead a bitter inward voice seemed to break into speech Dead
The viewless air seemed to be flocking with hidden listeners The very
clearness and the crystal silence were their ambush He alone seemed to
be the target of cold and hostile scrutiny There was not a breath to
breathe in this crisp pale sunshine It was all too rare too thin The
shadows lay like wings everlastingly folded The robin that had been
his only living witness lifted its throat and broke as if from the
uttermost outskirts of reality into its shrill passionless song
Lawford moved heavy eyes from one object to anotherbirdsungilded
stonethose two small earthworn faceshis handsa stirring in the
grass as of some creature labouring to climb up It was useless to sit
here any longer He must go back now Fancies were all very well for
a change but must be only occasional guests in a world devoted to
reality He leaned his hand on the dark grey wood and closed his eyes
The lids presently unsealed a little momentarily revealing astonished
aggrieved pupils and softly slowly they again descended

The flaming rose that had swiftly surged from the west into the zenith
dyeing all the churchyard grass a wild and vivid green and the stooping
stones above it a pure faint purple waned softly back like a falling
fountain into its basin In a few minutes only a faint orange burned in
the west dimly illuminating with its band of light the huddled figure
on his low wood seat his right hand still pressed against a faintly
beating heart Dusk gathered the first white stars appeared out of the
shadowy fields a nightjar purred But there was only the silence of the
falling dew among the graves Down here under the inkblack cypresses
the blades of the grass were stooping with cold drops and darkness lay
like the hem of an enormous cloak whose jewels above the breast of
its wearer might be in the unfathomable clearness the glittering
constellations

In his small cage of darkness Lawford shuddered and raised a furtive
head He stood up and peered eagerly and strangely from side to side He
stayed quite still listening as raptly as some wandering nightbeast to
the indiscriminate stir and echoings of the darkness He cocked his head
above his shoulder and listened again then turned upon the soundless
grass towards the hill He felt not the faintest astonishment or
strangeness in his solitude here only a little chilled and physically
uneasy and yet in this vast darkness a faint spiritual exaltation
seemed to hover

He hastened up the narrow path walking with knees a little bent like
an old labourer who has lived a life of stooping and came out into the
dry and dusty lane One moment his instinct hesitated as to which turn
to takeonly a moment he was soon walking swiftly almost trotting
downhill with this vivid exaltation in the huge dark night in his
heart and Sheila merely a little angry Titianesque cloud on a scarcely
perceptible horizon He had no notion of the time the golden hands of
his watch were indiscernible in the gloom But presently as he passed
by he pressed his face close to the cold glass of a little shopwindow
and pierced that out by an old Swiss cuckooclock He would if he
hurried just be home before dinner

He broke into a slow steady trot gaining speed as he ran on vaguely
elated to find how well his breath was serving him An odd smile
darkened his face at remembrance of the thoughts he had been thinking
There could be little amiss with the heart of a man who could shamble
along like this taking even pleasure an increasing pleasure in this
long wolflike stride He turned round occasionally to look into the
face of some fellowwayfarer whom he had overtaken for he felt not only
this unusual animation this peculiar zest but that like a boy on some
secret errand he had slightly disguised his very presence was going
masked as it were Even his clothes seemed to have connived at this
queer illusion No tailor had for these ten years allowed him so
much latitude He cautiously at last opened his garden gate and with
soundless agility mounted the six stone steps his latchkey ready in
his gloveless hand and softly let himself into the house

Sheila was out it seemed for the maid had forgotten to light the
lamp Without pausing to take off his greatcoat he hung up his hat ran
nimbly upstairs and knocked with a light knuckle on his bedroom door
It was closed but no answer came He opened it shut it locked it and
sat down on the bedside for a moment in the darkness so that he could
scarcely hear any other sound as he sat erect and still like some
night animal wary of danger attentively alert Then he rose from the
bed threw off his coat which was clammy with dew and lit a candle on
the dressingtable

Its narrow flame lengthened drooped brightened gleamed clearly He
glanced around him unusually contentedat the ruddiness of the low
fire the brass bedstead the warm red curtains the soft silveriness
here and there It seemed as if a heavy and dull dream had withdrawn out
of his mind He would go again some day and sit on the little hard seat
beside the crooked tombstone of the friendless old Huguenot He opened
a drawer took out his razors and faintly whistling returned to the
table and lit a second candle And still with this strange heightened
sense of life stirring in his mind he drew his hand gently over his
chin and looked unto the glass

For an instant he stood head to foot icily still without the least
feeling or thought or stirstaring into the lookingglass Then an
inconceivable drumming beat on his ear A warm surge like the onset of
a wave broke in him flooding neck face forehead even his hands with
colour He caught himself up and wheeled deliberately and completely
round his eyes darting to and fro suddenly to fix themselves in
a prolonged stare while he took a deep breath caught back his
selfpossession and paused Then he turned and once more confronted the
changed strange face in the glass

Without a sound he drew up a chair and sat down just as he was frigid
and appalled at the foot of the bed To sit like this with a kind of
incredibly swift torrent of consciousness bearing echoes and images
like straws and bubbles on its surface could not be called thinking
Some stealthy hand had thrust open the sluice of memory And words
voices faces of mockery streamed through without connection tendency
or sense His hands hung between his knees a deep and settled frown
darkened the features stooping out of the direct rays of the light and
his eyes wandered like busy and inquisitive but stupid animals over
the floor

If in that flood of unintelligible thoughts anything clearly recurred
at all it was the memory of Sheila He saw her face lit transfigured
distorted stricken appealing horrified His lids narrowed a vague
terror and horror mastered him He hid his eyes in his hands and cried
without sound without tears without hope like a desolate child He
ceased crying and sat without stirring And it seemed after an age of
vacancy and meaninglessness he heard a door shut downstairs a distant
voice and then the rustle of some one slowly ascending the stairs Some
one turned the handle in vain tapped Is that you Arthur

For an instant Lawford paused then like a child listening for an echo
answered Yes Sheila And a sigh broke from him his voice except
for a little huskiness was singularly unchanged

May I come in Lawford stood softly up and glanced once more into the
glass His lips set tight and a slight frown settled between the long
narrow intensely dark eyes

Just one moment Sheila he answered slowly just one moment

How long will you be

He stood erect and raised his voice gazing the while impassively into
the glass

Its no use he began as if repeating a lesson its no use your
asking me Sheila Please give me a moment aI am not quite myself
dear he added quite gravely

The faintest hint of vexation was in the answer

What is the matter Cant I help Its so very absurd

What is absurd he asked dully

Why standing like this outside my own bedroom door Are you ill I
will send for Dr Simon

Please Sheila do nothing of the kind I am not ill I merely want
a little time to think in There was again a brief pause and then a
slight rattling at the handle

Arthur I insist on knowing at once whats wrong this does not sound a
bit like yourself It is not even quite like your own voice

It is myself he replied stubbornly staring fixedly into the glass
You must give me a few moments Sheila Something has happened My face
Come back in an hour

Dont be absurd its simply wicked to talk like that How do I know
what you are doing As if I can leave you for an hour in uncertainty
Your face If you dont open at once I shall believe theres something
seriously wrong I shall send Ada for assistance

If you do that Sheila it will be disastrous I cannot answer for the
con Go quietly downstairs Say I am unwell dont wait dinner for me
come back in an hour oh half an hour

The answer broke out angrily You must be mad beside yourself to ask
such a thing I shall wait in the next room until you call

Wait where you please Lawford replied but tell them downstairs

Then if I tell them to wait until halfpast eight you will come down
You say you are not ill the dinner will be ruined Its absurd

Lawford made no answer He listened a while then he deliberately sat
down once more to try to think Like a squirrel in a cage his mind
seemed to be aimlessly unceasingly astir What is it really What
is it reallyreally He sat there and it seemed to him his body was
transparent as glass It seemed he had no body at allonly the memory
of an hallucinatory reflection in the glass and this inward voice
crying arguing questioning threatening out of the silenceWhat is
it reallyreallyREALLY And at last cold wearied out he rose
once more and leaned between the two long candleflames and stared
ononon into the glass

He gave that long dark face that had been foisted on him tricks to
dolift an eyebrow frown There was scarcely any perceptible pause
between the wish and its performance He found to his discomfiture that
the face answered instantaneously to the slightest emotion even to his
fainter secondary thoughts as if these unfamiliar features were not
entirely within control He could not in fact without the glass before
him tell precisely what that face WAS expressing He was still it
seemed keenly sane That he would discover for certain when Sheila
returned Terror rage horror had fallen back If only he felt ill or
was in pain he would have rejoiced at it He was simply caught in some
unheardof snarecaught how when where by whom



CHAPTER TWO

But the coolness and deliberation of his scrutiny had to a certain
extent calmed Lawfords mind and given him confidence Hitherto he had
met the little difficulties of life only to vanquish them with ease and
applause Now he was standing face to face with the unknown He burst
out laughing into a long low helpless laughter Then he arose and
began to walk softly swiftly to and fro across the roomfrom wall to
wall seven paces and at the fourth that awful unseen brightlylit
profile passed as swiftly over the tranquil surface of the
lookingglass The power of concentration was gone again He simply
paced on mechanically listening to a Babel of questions a conflicting
medley of answers But above all the confusion and turmoil of his brain
as a boatswains whistle rises above a storm so sounded that same
infinitesimal voice incessantly repeating another question now What
are you going to do What are you going to do

And in the midst of this confusion out of the infinite as it were
came another sharp tap at the door and all within sank to utter
stillness again

Its nearly halfpast eight Arthur I cant wait any longer

Lawford cast a last fleeting look into the glass turned and confronted
the closed door Very well Sheila you shall not wait any longer He
crossed over to the door and suddenly a swift crafty idea flashed into
his mind

He tapped on the panel Sheila he said softly I want you first
before you come in to get me something out of my old writingdesk in
the smokingroom Here is the key He pushed a tiny keyfrom off the
ring he carriedbeneath the door In the third little drawer from the
top on the left side is a letter please dont say anything now It
is the letter you wrote me you will remember after I had asked you to
marry me You scribbled in the corner under your signature the initials
YSOAdo you remember They meant You Silly Old Arthurdo you
remember Will you please get that letter at once

Arthur answered the voice from without empty of all expression
what does all this mean this mystery this hopeless nonsense about
a silly letter What has happened Is this a miserable form of
persecution Are you madI refuse to get the letter

Lawford stooped black and angular against the door I am not mad Oh
I am in the deadliest earnest Sheila You must get the letter if only
for your own peace of mind He heard his wife hesitate as she turned
He heard a sob And once more he waited

I have brought the letter came the low toneless voice again

Have you opened it

There was a rustle of paper Are the letters there underlined three
timesYSOA

The letters are there

And the date of the month is underneath April 3rd No one else
in the whole world living or dead could know of this but ourselves
Sheila

Will you please open the door

No one

I suppose notno one

Then come in He unlocked the door and opened it A dark rather
handsome woman with sleek hair in a silk dress of a dark rich colour
entered Lawford closed the door But his face was in shadow He had
still a moments respite

I need not ask you to be patient he began quickly if I could
possibly have spared youif there had been anybody in the world to go
to I am in horrible horrible trouble Sheila It is inconceivable I
said I was sane so I am but the fact isI went out for a walk it
was rather stupid perhaps so soon and I think I was taken ill or
somethingmy heart A kind of fit a nervous fit Possibly I am a
little unstrung and its all its mainly fancy but I think I cant
help thinking it has a little distortedchanged my face everything
Sheila except of course myself Would you mind looking He walked
slowly and with face averted towards the dressingtable

Simply a nervousto make such a fuss to scare began his wife
following him

Without a word he took up the two old china candlesticks and held them
one in each lankfingered hand before his face and turned

Lawford could see his wifeevery tint and curve and line as distinctly
as she could see him Her cheeks never had much colour now her whole
face visibly darkened from pallor to a dusky leaden grey as she
gazed It was not an illusion then not a miserable hallucination The
unbelievable the inconceivable had happened He replaced the candles
with trembling fingers and sat down

Well he said what is it really what is it really Sheila What on
earth are we to do

Is the door locked she whispered He nodded With eyes fixed
stirlessly on his face Sheila unsteadily seated herself a little out
of the candlelight in the shadow Lawford rose and put the key of
the door on his wifes little rosewood prayerdesk at her elbow and
deliberately sat down again

You said a fitwhere

I supposeisis it very differenthopeless You will understand
my being O Sheila what am I to do His wife sat perfectly still
watching him with unflinching attention

You gave me to understanda nervous fit where

Lawford took a deep breath and quietly faced her again In the old
churchyard Widderstone I was looking atat the gravestones

A fit in the old churchyard Widderstoneyou were looking at the
gravestones

Lawford shut his mouth I suppose soa fit he said presently
My heart went a little queer and I sat down and fell into a kind of
dozea stupor I suppose I dont remember anything more And then I
woke like this

How do you know

How do I know what

Like that

He turned slowly towards the lookingglass Why here I am

She gazed at him steadily and a hard incredulous almost cunning glint
came into her wide blue eyes She took up the key carelessly glanced
at it glanced at him It has made meI mean the first shock you
knowit has made me a little faint She walked slowly deliberately to
the door and unlocked it Ill get a little sal volatile She softly
drew out the key and without once removing her eyes from his face
opened the door and pushed the key noiselessly in on the other side
Please stay there I wont be a minute

Lawfords face smileda rather desperate yet for all that a patient
resolute smile Oh yes of course he said almost to himself I had
not foreseenat leastyou must do precisely what you please Sheila
You were going to lock me in You will however before taking any final
step please think over what it will entail I did not think you would
after such proof in this awful troubleI did not think you would
simply disbelieve me Sheila Who else is there to help me You have the
letter in your hand Isnt that sufficient proof It was overwhelming
proof to me And even I doubted too doubted myself But never mind why
I should have dreamed you would believe me or taken this awful thing
differently I dont know Its rather awful to have to go on alone
But there think it over I shall not stir until I hear the voices And
then honestly Sheila I couldnt face quite that Id sooner give up
altogether Any proof you can think ofI will O God I cannot bear
it He covered his face with his hands but in a moment looked up
unmoved once more Why for that matter he added slowly and as it
were with infinite pains a faint thin smile again stealing into his
face I think he turned wearily to the glass I think its almost
an improvement

Something deep in those dark clear pupils out of that lean adventurous
face gleamed back at him the distant flash of a heliograph as it
were height to height flashing Courage He shuddered and shut his
eyes But I would really rather he aided in a quiet childlike way I
would really rather Sheila you left me alone now

His wife stood irresolute I understand you to explain she said
that you went out of this house just your usual self this afternoon
for a walk that for some reason you went to Widderstoneto read the
tombstones that you had a heart attack or as you said at first a
fit that you fell into a stupor and came home likelike this Am I
likely to believe all that Am I likely to believe such a story as that
Whoever you are whoever you may be is it likely I am not in the least
afraid I thought at first it was some silly practical joke I thought
that at first She paused but no answer came Well I suppose in a
civilised country there is a remedy even for a joke as wicked as that

Lawford listened patiently She is pretending she is trying me she is
feeling her way he kept repeating to himself She knows I AM I but
hasnt the courage Let her talk

I shall leave the door open Sheila continued I am not as you
no doubt very naturally assumedI am not going to do anything either
senseless or heedless I am merely going to ask your brother Cecil
to come in if he is at home and if not no doubt our old friend
Mr Montgomery wouldwould help us Her scrutiny was still and
concentrated like that of a cat above a mouses hole

Lawford sat crouched together in the candlelight By all means
Sheila he said slowly choosing his words if you think poor old
Cecil who next January will have been three years in his grave will
be of any use in our difficulty Who Mr Montgomery is His voice
dropped in utter weariness You did it very well my dear he added
softly

Sheila gently closed the door and sat down on the bed He heard her
softly crying he heard the bed shaken with her sobs But a slow glance
towards the steady candleflames restrained him He let her cry on
alone When she had become a little more composed he stood up You have
had no dinner he managed to blurt out at last you will be faint
Its useless to talk even to think any more tonight Leave me to
myself for a while Dont look at me any more Perhaps I can sleep
perhaps if I sleep it will come right again When the servants are
gone up I will come down Just let me have somesome medical book or
other and some more candles Dont think Sheila dont even think

Sheila paid him no attention for a while You tell me not to think
she began in a low almost listless voice whyI wonder I am in my
right mind And eat How can you have the heartlessness to suggest it
You dont seem in the least to realize what you say You seem to have
lost allall consciousness I quite agree it is useless for me to
burden you with my company while you are in your present condition of
mind But you will at least promise me that you wont take any further
steps in this awful business She could not try as she would bring
herself again to look at him She rose softly paused a moment with
sidelong eyes then turned deliberately towards the door What what
have I done to deserve all this

From behind her that voice so extraordinarily likeand yet in some
vague fashion more arresting more resonant than her husbands broke
incredibly out once more You will please leave the key Sheila I am
ill but I am not yet in the padded room And please understand I take
no further steps in this awful business until I hear a strange voice
in the house Sheila paused but the quiet voice rang in her ear
desperately yet convincingly She took the key out of the lock placed
it on the bed and with a sigh that was not quite without a hint of
relief in its misery she furtively extinguished the gaslight on the
landing and rustled downstairs

She speedily returned I have brought the book she said hastily
I could only find the one volume I have said you have taken a fresh
chill No one will disturb you

Lawford took the book without a word And once more with eyes stonily
averted his wife left him to his own company and that of the face in
the glass

When completely deserted Lawford with fumbling fingers opened Quains
Dictionary of Medicine He had never had much curiosity and had
always hated what he disbelieved but none the less he had heard
occasionally of absurd and questionable experiments He remembered
even to have glanced over reports of cases in the newspapers concerning
disappearances loss of memory dual personality Cranks Oh yes he
thought now with a sense of cold humiliating relief there had been
such cases as his before They were no doubt curable They must be
comparatively common in Americathat land of jangled nerves Possibly
bromide rest a battery But Quain it seemed shared his prejudices
at least in this edition or had hidden away all such apocryphal matter
beneath technical terms where no sensible man could find it Besides
he muttered angrily whats the good of your one volume He flung
it down and strode to the bed and rang the bell Then suddenly
recollecting himself he paused and listened There came a tap on the
door Is that you Sheila he called doubtfully

No sir its me came the answer

Oh dont trouble I only wanted to speak to your mistress Its all
right

Mrs Lawford has gone out sir replied the voice

Gone out

Yes sir she told me not to mention it but I suppose as you asked

Oh thats all right never mind I didnt ring He stood with face
uplifted thinking

Can I do anything sir came the faint nervous question after a long
pause

One moment Ada he called in a loud voice He took out his
pocketbook sat down and scribbled a little note He hardly noticed
how changed his handwriting wasthe clear round letters crabbed and
irregular

Are you there Ada he called I am slipping a note beneath the
door just draw back the mat thats it Take it at once please to Mr
Critchetts and be sure to wait for an answer Then come back direct
to me up here I dont think Ada your mistress believes much in
Critchett but I have fully explained what I want He has made me up
many prescriptions Explain that to his assistant if he is not there
Go at once and you will be back before she is I should be so very much
obliged tell him Mr Arthur Lawford

The minutes slowly drifted by He sat quite still in the clear
untroubled light waiting in the silence of the empty house And for
the first time he was confronted with the cold incredible horror of his
ordeal Who would believe who could believe that behind this strange
and awful yet how simple mask lay himself What test what heapedup
evidence of identity would break it down It was all a loathsome
ignominy It was utterly absurd It was

Suddenly with a kind of apelike cunning he deliberately raised a
long lean forefinger and pointed it at the shadowy crystal of the
lookingglass Perhaps he was dead was really and indeed changed in
body was fated really and indeed to change in soul into That Its
that beastly voice again Lawford cried out loud looking vacantly at
his upstretched finger And then hand and arm not too willingly as it
were obeyed relaxed and fell to his side You must keep a tight hold
old man he muttered to himself Once once you lose yourselfthe
least symptom of thatthe least symptom and its all up And the
fools the heartless preposterous fools had brought him one volume

When on earth was Ada coming back She was lagging on purpose She was
in the conspiracy too Oh it should be a lesson to Sheila Oh if only
daylight would come What are you going to doto doto DO He rose
once more and paced his silent cage To and fro thinking no more
just using his eyes compelling them to wander from picture to picture
bedpost to bedpost now counting aloud his footsteps now humming only
only to keep himself from thinking At last he took out a drawer and
actually began arranging its medley of contents ties letters studs
concert and theatre programmesall higgledypiggledy And in the midst
of this childish strategem he heard a faint sound as of heavy water
trickling from a height He turned A thief was in one of the candles
It was guttering out He would be left in darkness He turned hastily
without a moments heed to call for light flung the door open and full
in the flare of a lamp illuminating her pale forehead and astonished
face beneath her black straw hat stood face to face with Ada

With one swift dexterous movement he drew the door to after him
looking straight into her almost colourless steady eyes Ah he
said instantly in a high faint voice the powder thank you yes
Mr Lawfords powder thank you thank you He must be kept absolutely
quietabsolutely Mrs Lawford is following Please tell her that I am
here when she returns Mr Critchett was in then Thank you Extreme
extreme silence please Again that knotted melodramatic finger raised
itself on high and within that lean cadaverous body the soul of its
lodger quailed at this spectral boldness But it was triumphant The
maid at once left him and went downstairs He heard faint voices in
muffled consultation And in a moment Sheilas silks rustled once
more on the staircase Lawford put down the lamp and watched her
deliberately close the door

What does this mean she began swiftly I understand thatAda tells
me a stranger is here giving orders directions Who is he where
is he You bound yourself on your solemn promise not to stir till
I returned You How can I how can we get decently through this
horrible business if you are so wretchedly indiscreet You sent Ada to
the chemists What for What for I say

Lawford watched his wife with an almost extraneous interest She was
certainly extremely interesting from that point of view that very
novel point of view Its quite useless he said to get in the least
nervous or hysterical I dont care for the darkness just now That was
all Tell the girl I am a strange doctorDr Simons new partner You
are clever at conventionalities Sheila Invent I said our patient must
be kept quietI really think he must That is all so far as Ada is
concerned What on earth else ARE we to say he broke out That
for the present to EVERYBODY is our only possible story It will give
us what we must havetime And nextwhere is the second volume of
Quain I want that And nextwhy have you broken faith with me Mrs
Lawford sat down This sudden and baffling outburst had stupefied her

I cant I cant make head or tail of what you say And as for having
broken faith as you call it would any wife would any sane woman face
what you have brought on us a situation like this without seeking
advice and help Mr Bethany will be perfectly discreetif he thinks
discretion desirable He is the only available friend we have close
enough to ask at once And things of this kind are I suppose if
anybodys concern his Its certain to leak out Everybody will hear
of it Dont flatter yourself you are going to hush up a thing like this
for long You cant keep living skeletons in a cupboard You think only
of yourself only of your own misfortune But whos to know pray that
you really are my husbandif you are The sooner I get the vicar on
my side the better for us both Who in the whole of the parishI ask
youand you must have the sense left to see thatwho will believe that
a respectable man a gentleman a Churchman would deliberately go out
to seek an afternoons amusement in a poky little country churchyard
Why apart from everything else THAT was absolutely mad to start with
Can you really wonder at the result

Probably because she still steadfastly refused to look at him her
memory kept losing its hold on the appalling fact facing them She
realised fully only that she was in a great unwarrantable and
insurmountable difficulty but until she actually lifted her eyes for a
moment she had not fully realised what that difficulty was She got up
with a sudden and horrible nausea One moment she said I will see
if the servants have gone to bed

That long saturnine face behind which Lawford lay in a dull and
desperate ambush smiled Something partaking of its clay some reflex
ghost of its rather remarkable features was even a little amused at
Sheila

She returned in a moment and stood in profile in the doorway Will you
come down she remarked distantly

One moment Sheila Lawford began miserably Before we take this
irrevocable step a step I implore you to postpone awhilefor what
comes I suppose may gowhat precisely have you told the vicar I must
in fairness know that

In fairness she began ironically and suddenly broke off Her husband
had turned the flame of the lamp low down in the vacant room behind
them the corridor was lit obscurely by the chandelier far down in the
hall below A faint inexplicable dread fell softly and coldly on her
heart Have you no trust in me she murmured a little bitterly I
have simply told him the truth

They softly descended the stairs she first the dark figure following
close behind her



CHAPTER THREE

Mr Bethany sat awaiting them in the diningroom a large
heavilyfurnished room with a great benign lookingglass on the
mantelpiece a marble clock and with rich old damask curtains Fleecy
silver hair was all that was visible of their visitor when they entered
But Mr Bethany rose out of his chair when he heard them and with a
little jerk turned sharply round Thus it was that the goldspectacled
vicar and Lawford first confronted each other the one brightly
illuminated the other framed in the gloom of the doorway Mr Bethanys
first scrutiny was timid and courteous but beneath it he tried to be
keen and himself hastened round the table almost at a trot to obtain
as delicately as possible a closer view But Lawford having shut
the door behind him had gone straight to the fire and seated himself
leaning his face in his hands Mr Bethany smiled faintly waved his hand
almost as if in blessing but certainly in peace and tapped Mrs Lawford
into the chair upon the other side But he himself remained standing

Mrs Lawford has I declare been telling family secrets he began
and paused peering But there you will forgive an old friends
intrusionthis little confidence about a change my dear fellowabout
a ramble and a change He sat down put up his kind little puckered
face and peered again at Lawford and then very hastily at his wife
But all her attention was centred on the bowed figure opposite to her
Lawford responded to this cautious advance without raising his head

You do not wish me to repeat all that my wife tells me she has told
you

Dear me no said Mr Bethany cheerfully I wish nothing nothing old
friend You must not burden yourself with me If I may be of any help
here I am Oh no no he paused with blinking eyes but wits
still shrewd and alert Why doesnt the man raise his head he thought
A mere domestic dispute

I thought he went on ruminatingly I thought on Tuesday yes on
Tuesday that you werent looking quite the thing Indeed I remarked on
it But now I understand from Mrs Lawford that the malady has taken
a graver turneh Lawford an heretical turn I hear you have been
wandering from the true fold Mr Bethany leaned forward with what might
be described as a very large smile in a very small compass And that
of course entailed instant retribution He broke off solemnly I know
Widderstone churchyard well a most verdant and beautiful spot The late
rector a Mr Strickland was a very old friend of mine And his wife
dear good Alicia used to set out her babies in the morning to sleep
and to play there twenty dear me perhaps twentyfive years ago But
I did not know my dear Lawford that you and suddenly without an
instants warning something seemed to shout at him Look look He is
looking at you He stopped faltered and a slight warmth came into his
face And and you were taken ill there His voice had fallen flat and
faint

I fell asleepor something of that sort came the stubborn reply

Yes said Mr Bethany brightly so your wife was saying Fell
asleep so have I tooscores of times he beamed with beads of sweat
glistening on his forehead And then Im not Im not persisting

Then I woke refreshed I think as it seemedI felt much better and
came home

Ah yes said his visitor And after that there was a long brightly
lit intense pause at the end of which Lawford raised his face and
again looked firmly at his friend

Mr Bethany was now a shrunken old man he sat perfectly still his head
craned a little forward and his veined hands clutching his bent spare
knees

There wasnt the least sign of devilry or outfacingness or insolence
in that lean shadowy steady head and yet he himself was compelled to
sidle his glance away so much the face shook him He closed his eyes
too as a cat does after exchanging too direct a scrutiny with human
eyes He put out towards and withdrew a groping hand from Mrs Lawford

Is it came a voice from somewhere is it a great change sir I
thought perhaps I may have exaggeratedcandlelight you know

Mr Bethany remained still and silent striving to entertain one thought
at a time His lips moved as if he were talking to himself And again
it was Lawfords faltering voice that broke the silence You see
he said I have never no fit or anything of that kind before I
remember on Tuesday oh yes quite well I did feel seedy very And
we talked didnt weHarvest Festival Mrs Wines flowers the new
offertorybags and all that For Gods sake Vicar it is not as bad
asas they make out

Mr Bethany woke with a start He leaned forward and stretched out a
long black wrinkled sleeve just managing to reach far enough to tap
Lawfords knee Dont worry dont worry he said soothingly We
believe we believe

It was none the less a sheer act of faith He took off his spectacles
and took out his handkerchief What we must do eh my dear he half
turned to Mrs Lawford what we must do is to consult yes consult
together And laterwe must have advicemedical advice unless as
I very much suspect it is merely a little quite temporary physical
aberration Science I am told is making great strides experimenting
groping after things which no sane man has ever dreamed of
beforewithout being burned alive for it Whats in a name Nerves
especially Lawford

Mrs Lawford sat perfectly still absorbedly listening turning her face
first this way then that to each speaker in turn That is what
I thought she said and cast one fleeting glance across at the
fireplace but

The little old gentleman turned sharply with halfblind eyes and lips
tight shut I think he said with a hind of austere humour I think
do you know I see no but He paused as if to catch the echo and
added Its our only course He continued to polish round and round
his glasses Mrs Lawford rather magnificently rose

Perhaps if I were to leave you together awhile I shall not be far
off It is she explained as if into a huge vacuum it is a terrible
visitation She moved gravely round the table and very softly and
firmly closed the door after her

Lawford took a deep breath Of course he said you realise my
wife does not believe me She thinks he explained naively as if to
himself she thinks I am an imposter Goodness knows what she does
think I cant think much myselffor long

The vicar rubbed busily on I have found Lawford he said smoothly
that in all real difficulties the only feasible plan isis to face the
main issue The others right themselves Now to take a plunge into your
generosity You have let me in far enough to make it impossible for me
to get outmay I hear then exactly the whole story All that I know
now so far as I could gather from your wife poor soul is of course
inconceivable that you went out one man and came home another You will
understand my dear man I am speaking as it were by rote God has
mercifully ordered that the human brain works slowly first the
blow hours afterwards the bruise Oh dear me that man Humeon
miraclespositively amazing So that too please you will be quite
clear about Credonot quia impossible est but because you Lawford
have told me Now then if it wont be too wearisome to you the whole
story He sat lean and erect in his big chair a hand resting
loosely on each knee in one spectacles in the other a dangling pocket
handkerchief And the dark sallow aquiline formidable figure with
its oddly changing voice retold the whole story from the beginning

You were aware then of nothing different I understand until you
actually looked into the glass

Only vaguely I mean that after waking I felt much better more alert
And my thoughts

Ah yes your thoughts

I hardly knowoh clear as if I had had a real long rest It was just
like being a boy again Influenza dispirits one so

Mr Bethany gazed without stirring And yet you know he said I can
hardly believe I mean conceive howYou have been taking no drugs no
quackery Lawford

I never dose myself said Lawford with sombre pride

God bless me thats Lawford to the echo thought his visitor And
before he went on gently I really cannot conceive you see how
a mere fit could Before you sat down you were quite alone He stuck
out his head There was nobody with you

With me Oh no came the soft answer

What had you been thinking of In these days of faithcures and
hypnotism and telepathy and subliminalitieswhy the simple old world
grows very confusing But rarely very rarely novel You were thinking
you say do you remember perhaps just the drift

Well began Lawford ruminatingly there was something curious even
then perhaps I remember for instance I knelt down to read an old
tombstone There was a little seatno back And an epitaph The sun was
just setting some French name And there was a long jagged crack in
the stone like the black line you know one sees after lightning I mean
its as clear as that even now in memory Oh yes I remember And then
I suppose came the sleepstupid sluggish and then well here I am

You are absolutely certain then persisted Mr Bethany almost
querulously there was no living creature near you Bless me Lawford
I see no unkindness in believing what the Bible itself relates There
are powers supernatural Saul and so on We are all convinced of that
No one

I remember distinctly replied Lawford in a calm stubborn voice I
looked up all around me while I was kneeling there and there wasnt a
soul to be seen Because you see it even then occurred to me that it
would have looked rather queermy wandering about like that I mean
Facing me there were some cypresstrees and beyond a low sunken
fence and then just open country Up above there were the gravestones
toppling down the hill where I had just strolled down and sunshine
He suddenly threw up his hand Oh marvellous streaming in
goldflaming like Gods own antechamber

There was a very pregnant pause Mr Bethany shrunk back a little into
his chair His lips moved he folded his spectacles

Yes yes he said And then very quietly he stole one molelike look
into his sidesmans face

What is Dr Simons number he said Lawford was gazing gloomily
into the fire Oh Annandale he replied absently I dont know the
number

Do you believe in him Your wife mentioned him Is he clever

Oh hes new said Lawford old James was our doctor Hehe killed
my father He laughed out shamefacedly

A sound lovable man said Mr Bethany one of the kindest men I ever
knew and a very old friend of mine

And suddenly the dark face turned with a shudder from the fire and
spoke in a low trembling voice Only one thingonly one thingmy
sanity my sanity If once I forget who will believe me He thrust his
long lean fingers beneath his coat And mad he added I would sooner
die

Mr Bethany deliberately adjusted his spectacles May I may I
experiment he said boldly There came a tap on the door

Bless me said the vicar taking out his watch it is a quarter to
twelve Yes yes Mrs Lawford he trotted round to the door We are
beginning to see lighta ray

But II can see in the dark whispered Lawford as if at a cue
turning with an inscrutable smile to the fire

The vicar came again wrapped up in a little tight grey greatcoat and
a white silk muffler He looked up unflinching into Lawfords face
and tears stood in his eyes Patience patience my dear fellow
he repeated gravely squeezing his hand And rest complete rest is
imperative Just till the first thing tomorrow And till then he
turned to Mrs Lawford where she stood looking in at the doorway oh
yes complete quiet and caution

Mrs Lawford let him out He shook his head once or twice holding her
fingers Oh yes he whispered it is your husband not the smallest
doubt I tried for MYSELF But somethingsomething has happened Dont
fret him now Have patience Oh yes it is incredible the change But
there the very first thing tomorrow She closed the door gently
after him and stepping softly back to the diningroom peered in Her
husbands back was turned but he could see her in the lookingglass
stooping a little with set face watching him in the silvery stillness

Well he said is the old he doggedly met the fixed eyes facing
him there is our old friend gone

Yes said Sheila hes gone Lawford sighed and turned round Its
useless talking now Sheila No more questions I cannot tell you how
tired I am And my head

What is wrong with your head inquired his wife discreetly

The haggard face turned gravely and patiently Only one of my old
headaches he smiled my old bilious headachesthe hereditary Lawford
variety But his voice fell low again We must get to bed

With a rather pretty and childish movement Sheila gently drew her hands
across her silk skirts Yes dear she said I have made up a bed for
you in the large spare room It is thoroughly aired She came softly
in hastened over to a closed worktable that stood under the curtains
and opened it

Lawford watched her utterly expressionless utterly motionless He
opened his mouth and shut it again still watching his wife as she
stooped with ridiculously too busy fingers searching through her
coloured silks

Again he opened his mouth Yes he said and stalked slowly towards
the door But there he paused God knows he said strangely and
meekly I am sorry sorry for all this You will forgive me Sheila

She looked up swiftly Its very tiresome I cant find anywhere she
murmured I cant find anywhere thethe little red box key

Lawfords cheek turned more sallow than ever You are only pretending
to look for it he said to try me We both know perfectly well the
lock is broken Ada broke it

Sheila let fall the lid and yet for a while her eyes roved over it as
if in violent search for something Then she turned I am so very glad
the vicar was at home she said brightly And mind mind you rest
Arthur Theres nothing so bad but it might be worse Oh I cant I
cant bear it She sat down in the chair and huddled her face between
her hands sobbing on and on without a tear

Lawford listened and stared solemnly Whatever it may be Sheila I
will be loyal he said

Her sobs hushed and again cold horror crept over her Nobody in
the whole world could have said that I will be loyal quite like
thatnobody but Arthur She stood up patting her hair I dont think
my brain would bear much more Its useless to talk If you will go up
I will put out the lamp



CHAPTER FOUR

One solitary and tall candle burned on the great dressingtable Faint
solitary pictures broke the blankness of each wall The carpet was rich
the bed impressive and the basins on the washstand as uninviting as the
bed Lawford sat down on the edge of it in complete isolation He sat
without stirring listening to his watch ticking in his pocket The
china clock on the chimney piece pointed cheerfully to the hour of dawn
It was exactly he computed carefully five hours and seven minutes
fast Not the slightest sound broke the stillness until he heard very
very softly and gradually the key of his door turn in the oiled wards
and realized that he was a prisoner

Women were strange creatures How often he had heard that said he
thought lamely He felt no anger no surprise or resentment at the
trick It was only to be expected He could sit on till morning easily
till morning He had never noticed before how empty a wellfurnished
room could seem It was his own room too his best visitors room His
fatherinlaw had slept here with his whiskers on that pillow His
wifes most formidable aunt had been all night here alone with these
pictures She certainly was But what are you doing here cried a
voice suddenly out of his reverie

He started up and stretched himself and taking out the neat little
packet that the maid had brought from the chemists he drew up a chair
and sat down once more in front of the glass He sighed vacantly rose
and lifted down from the wall above the fireplace a tinted photograph
of himself that Sheila had had enlarged about twelve years ago It was
a brighter younger hairier but unmistakably the same dull indolent
Lawford who had ventured into Widderstone churchyard that afternoon The
cheek was a little plumper the eyes not quite so fulllidded the hair
a little more precisely parted the upper lip graced with a small blonde
moustache He tilted the portrait into the candlelight and compared it
with this reflection in the glass of what had come out of Widderstone
feature with feature with perfect composure and extreme care Then he
laid down the massive frame on the table and gazed quietly at the tiny
packet

It was to be a day of queer experiences He had never before realized
with how many miracles mere everyday life is besieged Here in this
small punctilious packet lay a Sesamea power of transformation beside
which the transformation of that rather flaccid face of the noonday into
this tense sinister face of midnight was but as a moving from house
to housea change just as irrevocable and complete and yet so very
normal Which should it be that orhis face lifted itself once more
to the icelike gloom of the lookingglassthat or this

It simply gazed back with a kind of quizzical pity on its lean features
under the scrutiny of eyes so deep so meaningful so desolate and yet
so indomitably courageous In the brain behind them a slow and stolid
argument was in progress the one baffling reply on the one side to
every appeal on the other being still simply What dreams may come

Those eyes surely knew something of dreams else why this violent and
stubborn endeavour to keep awake

Lawford did indeed once actually frame the question But who the
devil are you And it really seemed the eyes perceptibly widened or
brightened The mere vexation of his unparalleled position Sheilas
pathetic incredulity his old vicars laborious kindness the tiresome
network of experience into which he would be dragged struggling on the
morrow and on the morrow after that and after thatthe thought of
all these things faded for the moment from his mind lost if not their
significance at least their instancy

He simply sat face to face with the sheer difficulty of living on
at all He even concluded in a kind of lethargy that if nothing had
occurred no change he might still be sitting here Arthur Rennet
Lawford in his best visitors room deciding between inscrutable life
and justdeath He supposed he was tired out His thoughts hadnt even
the energy to complete themselves None cared but himself and thisthis
Silence

But what does it all mean the insistent voice he was getting to know
so well began tediously inquiring again And every time he raised
his eyes or rather as in many cases it seemed his eyes raised
themselves they saw this haunting face therea face he no longer
bitterly rebelled at nor dimmed with scrutiny but a face that was
becoming a kind of hold on life even a kind of refuge an ally It was
a face that might have come out of a rather flashy book or such as is
revered on the stage A rotten bad face he whispered at it in his own
familiar slang after some such abrupt encounter a fearless packed
daring fascinating face with evenwhata spice of genius in it
Whose the devils face was it What on earth was the matter Brazen
it out a jubilant thought cried suddenly follow it up play the
game give me just one opening Thinkthink what Ive risked

And all these voices thought Lawford in deadly lassitude meant only
one thinginsanity A blazing impotent indignation seized him He
leaned near peering as it were out of a red dusky mist He snatched up
the china candlestick and poised it above the sardonic reflection as
if to throw Then slowly with infinite pains he drew back from the
glass and replaced the candlestick on the table stuffed his paper
packet into his pocket took off his boots and threw himself on to the
bed In a little while in the faint still light he opened drowsily
wondering eyes Poor old thing his voice murmured Poor old Sheila



CHAPTER FIVE

It was but little after daybreak when Mrs Lawford after listening at
his door a while turned the key and looked in on her husband Bluegrey
light from between the venetian blinds just dusked the room She stood
in a bluish dressinggown her hand on her bosom looking down on the
lean impassive face For the briefest instant her heart had leapt with
an indescribable surmise to fall dull as lead once more Breathing
equably and quietly the strange figure lay stretched upon the bed How
can he sleep How can he sleep she whispered with a black and hopeless
indignation What a night she had had And he

She turned noiselessly away The candle had guttered to extinction The
big glass reflected her voluminous and wan her darkringed eyes full
lips rich glossy hair and rounded chin Yes yes it seemed to
murmur mournfully She turned away and drawing stealthily near stooped
once more quite low and examined the face on the pillow with lynxlike
concentration And though every nerve revolted at the thought she was
finally convinced unwillingly but assuredly that her husband was
here Indeed if it were not so how could she for a single moment have
accepted the possibility that he was a stranger He seemed to haunt
like a ghostly emanation this strange detestable faceas memory
supplies the features concealed beneath a mask The face was still
and stony like one dead or imaged in wax yet beneath it dreams were
passingsilly ordinary Lawford dreams She was almost alarmed at the
terribly rancorous hatred she felt for the face It was just like
Arthur to be so taken in

Then she too remembered Quain and remembered also in the slowly paling
dusk that the house would soon be stirring She went out and noiselessly
locked the door again But it was useless to begin looking for
Quain nowher husband had a good many dull books most of them his
eccentric fathers What must the servants be thinking and what was
all that talk about a mysterious visitor She would have to question
Adadiplomatically She returned to her room and sat down in an
armchair and waited In sheer weariness she fell into a doze and woke
at the sound of dustpan and broom She rang the bell and asked for hot
water tea and a basin of cornflour

And please Ada be as quiet as possible over your work your master is
in a nice sleep and must not be disturbed on any account In the front
bedroom She looked up suddenly By the way who let Dr Ferguson in
last night It was dangerous but successful

Dr Ferguson maam Oh you mean He WAS in

Sheila smiled resignedly Was in What do you mean was in And where
were you then

I had been sent out to Critchetts the chemists

Of course of course So cook let Dr Ferguson in then Why didnt you
say so before Ada And did you bring the medicine with you

It was a packet in an envelope maam But Cook is sure she heard
no knocknot while I was out So Dr Ferguson must have come in quite
unbeknown

Well really said Sheila it seems very difficult to get at the
truth sometimes And when illness is in the house I cannot understand
why there should be no one available to answer the door You must
have left it ajar unsecured when you went out And pray what if Dr
Ferguson had been some common tramp That would have been a nice thing

I am quite certain said Ada a little flatly that I did shut the
door And cook says she never so much as stirred from the kitchen till
I came down the area steps with the packet And thats all I know about
it maam except that he was here when I came back I did not know even
there was a Dr Ferguson and my mother has lived here nineteen years

We must be thankful your mother enjoys such good health replied
Mrs Lawford suavely Please tell cook to be very careful with the
cornflourto be sure its well mixed and thoroughly done

Mrs Lawfords eyes followed with a certain discomfort those narrow print
shoulders descending the stairs And this abominable ruse wasArthurs
She ran up lightly and listened with her ear to the panel of his door
And just as she was about to turn away again there came a little light
knock at the front door

Mrs Lawford paused at the loop of the staircase and not altogether
with gratitude or relief she heard the voice of Mr Bethany inquiring in
cautious but quite audible tones after her husband

She dressed quickly and went down The little white old man looked very
solitary in the long fireless drawingroom

I could not sleep he said I dont think I grasped in the least I
dont indeed until I was nearly home the complexity of our problem
I came in fact to a lamppost It was casting a peculiar shadow
And thenyou know how such thoughts seize us my dearlike a sudden
inspiration I realised how tenuous how appallingly tenuous a hold we
every one of us have on our mere personality But that he continued
rapidly thats only for ourselvesand after the event Ours just
now is to act And first

You really do thenyou really are convinced began Mrs Lawford

But Mr Bethany was too quick We must be most circumspect My dear
friend we must be most circumspect for all our sakes And this youll
say he added smiling stretching out his arms his soft hat in one
hand his umbrella in the otherthis is being circumspecta seven
oclock in the morning call But you see my dear I have come as I
took the precaution of explaining to the maid because its now or
never today It does so happen that I have to take a wedding for an old
friends niece at Witchett so when in need you see Providence enables
us to tell even the conventional truth Now really how is he has he
slept has he recalled himself at all is there any changeand dear
me how are YOU

Mrs Lawford sighed A broken night is really very little to a mother
she said He is still asleep He hasnt I think stirred all night

Not stirred Mr Bethany repeated You baffle me And you have
watched

Oh no was the cheerful answer I felt that quiet solitude space
was everything he preferred it so Hehe changed alone I suppose
Dont you think it almost stands to reason that he will be alonewhen
he comes back Was I right But there its useless its worse than
useless to talk like this My husband is gone Some terrible thing has
happened Whatever the mystery may be he will never come back alive My
only fear is that I am dragging you into a matter that should from the
beginning have been entrusted toOh its monstrous It appeared for a
moment as if she were blinking to keep back her tears yet her scrutiny
seemed merely to harden

Only the merest flicker of the folded eyelids over the greenish eyes of
her visitor answered the challenge He stood small and black peeping
fixedly out of the window at the sunflecked laurels

Last night he said slowly when I said goodbye to your husband on
the tip of my tongue were the words I have used in season and out of
season for nearly fortyfive yearsGod knows best Well my dear
lady a sense of humour a sense of reverence or perhaps even a taint
of scepticismcall it what you willjust intercepted them Oh no
not any of these my child just pity overwhelming pity God does know
best but in a matter like this it is not even my place to say so It
would be good for none of us to endanger our souls even with verbal
cant Now if do you think I had just five minutes talkfive
minutes would it disquiet him

Only by an almost undignified haste for the vicar was remarkably
agile Sheila managed to unlock the bedroom door without apparently his
perceiving it and with a warning finger she preceded him into the great
bedroom Oh yes yes he was whispering to himself alonewell
well He hung his hat on his umbrella and leaned it in a corner and
then he turned

I dont think you know an old friend does him any wrong but last
night I had no real oppor He firmly adjusted his spectacles and
looked long into the dark dispassioned face

Hm he said and fidgeted and peered again Mrs Lawford watched him
keenly

Do you still she began

But at the same moment he too broke silence suddenly stepping back with
the innocent remark Has hehas he asked for anything

Only for Quain

Quain

The medical Dictionary

Oh yes bless me of course A calm complete sleep of utter
prostrationutter nervous prostration And can one wonder Poor fellow
poor fellow He walked to the window and peered between the blinds
Sparrows sunshineyes and heres the postman he said as if to
himself Then he turned sharply round with mind made up

Now do you leave me here he said Take half an hours quiet rest
He will be glad of a dull old fellow like me when he wakes And as for
my pretty bride if I miss the train she must wait till the next
Good discipline my dear Oh dear me I dont change What a precious
experience now this would have been for a tottery talkative owlish
old parochial creature like me But there there Light words make heavy
hearts I see I shall be quite comfortable No no I breakfasted at
home Theres hat and umbrella at 93 I can fly

Mrs Lawford thanked him mutely He smilingly but firmly bowed her out
and closed the door

But eyes and brain had been very busy He had looked at the gutted
candle at the tinted bland portrait on the dressingtable at the chair
drawnup at the boots and now again he turned almost with a groan
towards the sleeper Then he took out an envelope on which he had
jotted various memoranda and waited awhile Minutes passed and at last
the sleeper faintly stirred muttering

Mr Bethany stooped quickly What is it what is it he whispered

Lawford sighed I was only dreaming Sheila he said and softly
peacefully opened his eyes I dreamed I was in the His lids
narrowed his dark eyes fixed themselves on the anxious spectacled face
bending over him Mr Bethany Where Whats wrong

His friend put out his hand There there he said soothingly do not
be disturbed do not disquiet yourself

Lawford struggled up Slowly painfully consciousness returned to him
He glanced furtively round the room at his clothes slinkingly at
the vicar licked his lips flushed with extraordinary rapidity and
suddenly burst into tears

Mr Bethany sat without movement waiting till he should have spent
himself Now Lawford he said gently compose yourself old friend
We must face the musiclike men He went to the window drew up the
blind peeped out and took off his spectacles

The first thing to be done he said returning briskly to his chair
is to send for Simon Now does Simon know you WELL Lawford shook his
head Would he recognise you I mean

I have only met him oncein the evening

Good let him come immediately then Tell him just the facts If I am
not mistaken he will poohpooh the whole thing tell you to keep quiet
not to worry and so on My dear fellow if we realised say typhoid
whod dare to face it That will give us time to wait a while to
recover our breath to see what happens next And ifas I dont
believe for a momentWhy in that case I heard the other day of a most
excellent manGrosser of Wimpole Street nerves He would be absorbed
Hell bottle you in spirit Lawford Well have him down quietly You
see But there wont be any necessity Oh no By then light will have
come We shall remember What I mean is this He crossed his legs
and pushed out his lips We are on quaky ground and its absolutely
essential that you keep cool and trust I am yours heart and soulyou
know that I own frankly at first I was shaken And I have I confess
been very cunning But first faith then evidence to bolster it up The
faith was absolutehe placed one firm hand on Lawfords kneewhy
I cannot explain but it was The evidence is convincing But there are
others to think of The shock the incredibleness the consequences we
must not scan too closely Think WITH never against and bang go all
the arguments Your wife poor dear believes but of course of course
she is horribly he broke off of course she is SHAKEN you old
simpleton Time will heal all that Time will wear out the mask Time
will tire out this detestable physical witchcraft The mind the selfs
the thing Old fogey though I may seem for saying itthat must be kept
unsmirched We wont go wearily over the painful subject again You
told me last night dear old friend that you were absolutely alone at
Widderstone That is enough But here we have visible facts tangible
effects and there must have been a definite reason and a cause for
them I believe in the devil in the Powers of Darkness Lawford
as firmly as I believe he and they are powerlessin the long run
Theywhat shall we sayhave surrendered their intrinsicality You can
just go through evil as you can go through a sewer and come out on the
other side too A loathsome process too But therewe are not speaking
of any such monstrosities and even if we were you and I with Gods
help would just tire them out And that ally gone our poor dear old Mrs
Grundy will at once capitulate Eh Eh

Through all this long and arduous harangue consciousness like the
gradual light of dawn had been flooding that other brain And the face
that now confronted Mr Bethany though with his feeble unaided sight he
could only very obscurely discern it was vigilant and keen in every
sharpcut hungry feature

A rather prolonged silence followed the visitor peering mutely The
black eyes nearly closed the face turned slowly towards the window saw
burntout candle comprehensive glass

Yes yes he said Ill send for Simon at once

Good said Mr Bethany and more doubtfully repeated good Now
theres only one thing left he went on cheerfully I have jotted down
a few test questions here they are questions no one on this earth could
answer but you Lawford They are merely for external proofs You wont
you cant mistake my motive We cannot foretell or foresee what need
may arise for just such jogtrot primitive evidence I propose that you
now answer them here in writing

Lawford stood up and walked to the lookingglass and paused He put his
hand to his head es he said of course its a rattling good move
Im not quite awake myself I mean Ill do it now He took out a
pencil case and tore another leaf from his pocketbook What are they

Mr Bethany rang the bell Sheila herself answered it She stood on the
threshold and looked across through a shaft of autumnal sunshine at
her husband and her husband with a quiet strange smile looked across
through the sunshine at his wife Mr Bethany waited in vain

I am just going to put the archimpostor through his credentials he
said tartly Now then Lawford He read out the questions one by one
from his crafty little list pursing his lips between each and one
by one Lawford seated at the dressingtable fluently scribbled
his answers Then question and answer were rigorously compared by Mr
Bethany with small white head bent close and spectacles poised upon the
powerful nose and signed and dated and passed to Mrs Lawford without a
word

Mrs Lawford read question and answer where she stood in complete
silence She looked up Many of these questions I dont know the
answers to myself she said

It is immaterial said Mr Bethany

One answer isis inaccurate Yes yes quite so due to a mistake in
a letter from myself

Mrs Lawford read quietly on folded the papers and held them out
between finger and thumb Thehandwriting she remarked very
softly

Wonderful isnt it said Mr Bethany warmly all the general look and
run of the thing different but every real essential feature unchanged
Now into the envelope And now a little wax

Mrs Lawford stood waiting Theres a green piece of sealingwax
almost drawled the quiet voice in the top right drawer of the nest
in the study which old James gave me the Christmas before last He
glanced with lowered eyelids at his wifes flushed cheek Their eyes
met

Thank you she said

When she returned the vicar was sitting in a chair leaning his chin on
the knobbed handle of his umbrella He rose and lit a taper for her
with a match from a little green pot on the table And Mrs Lawford with
trembling fingers sealed the letter as he directed with his own seal

There he said triumphantly how many more such brilliant lawyers I
wonder lie dormant in the Church And who shall keep this Why all
three of course He went on without pausing Some little drawer now
secret and undetectable with a lock Just such a little drawer that
locked itself with a spring lay by chance in the lookingglass There
the letter was hidden And Mr Bethany looked at his watch Nineteen
minutes he said The next thing my dear childwere getting on
swimminglyand its astonishing how things are simplified by mere
usethe next thing is to send for Simon

Sheila took a deep breath but did not look up I am entirely in your
hands she replied

So be it said he crisply Get to bed Lawford its better so And
Ill look in on my way back from Witchett I came my dear fellow in
gloomy disturbance of mind It was getting up too early it fogs old
brains Goodbye goodbye

He squeezed Lawfords hand Then with umbrella under his arm his hat
on his head his spectacles readjusted he hurried out of the room Mrs
Lawford followed him For a few minutes Lawford sat motionless with
head bent a little and eyes restlessly scanning the door Then he rose
abruptly and in a quarter of an hour was in bed alone with his slow
thoughts while a basin of cornflour stood untasted on a little table
at his bedside and a cheerful fire burned in the best visitors rooms
tiny grate

At halfpast eleven Dr Simon entered this soundless seclusion He sat
down beside Lawford and took temperature and pulse Then he half closed
his lids and scanned his patient out of an unusually dark unEnglish
face with straight black hair and listened attentively to his rather
incoherent story It was a story very much modified and rounded off
Nor did Lawford draw Dr Simons attention to the portrait now smiling
conventionally above their heads from the wall over the fireplace

It was rather bleakthe wind and I think perhaps I had had a
touch of influenza It was a silly thing to do But still Dr Simon one
doesnt expectwell there I dont feel the same manphysically I
really cannot explain how great a change has taken place And yet I feel
perfectly fit in myself And if it were not forfor being laughed at
go back to town today Why my wife scarcely recognised me

Dr Simon continued his scrutiny Try as he would Lawford could not
raise his downcast eyes to meet direct the doctors polite attention

And what said Dr Simon what precisely is the nature of the change
Have you any pain

No not the least pain said Lawford I think perhaps or rather my
face is a little shrunkenand yet lengthened at least it feels so
and a faint twinge of rheumatism But my hairwell I dont know its
difficult to say ones self He could get on so very much better
he thought if only his mind would be at peace and these preposterous
promptings and voices were still

Dr Simon faced the window and drew his hand softly over his head
We never can be too cautious at a certain age and especially after
influenza he said It undermines the whole system and in particular
the nervous system leaving the mind the prey of the most melancholy
fancies I should astound you Mr Lawford with the devil influenza
plays A slight nervous shock and a chill quite slight I hope A
few days rest and plenty of nourishment Theres nothing temperature
inconsiderable All perfectly intelligible Most certainly reassure
yourself And as for the change you speak ofhe looked steadily at the
dark face on the pillow and smiled amiablyI dont think we need
worry much about that It certainly was a bleak wind yesterdayand a
cemetery my dear sir It was indiscreetyes very He held out his
hand You must not be alarmed he said very distinctly with
the merest trace of an accent air sunshine quiet nourishment
sleepthat is all The little window might be a few inches open
andand any light reading

He opened the door and joined Mrs Lawford on the staircase He talked
to her quietly over his shoulder all the way downstairs It was it was
sporting with Providencea wind believe me nearly due east in spite
of the warm sunshine

But the changethe change Mrs Lawford managed to murmur tragically
as he strode to the door Dr Simon smiled and gracefully tapped his
forehead with a redgloved forefinger

Humour him humour him he repeated indulgently Rest and quiet
will soon put that little trouble out of his head Oh yes I did notice
itthe set drawn look and the droop quite so Good morning

Mrs Lawford gently closed the door after him A glimpse of Ada crossing
from room to room suggested a precaution She called out in her
clearest notes If Dr Ferguson should call while I am out Ada will
you please tell him that Dr Simon regretted that he was unable to wait
Thank you She paused with hand on the balusters then slowly ascended
the stairs Her husbands face was turned to the ceiling his hands
clasped above his head She took up her stand by the fireplace resting
one silkslippered foot on the fender Dr Simon is reassuring she
said but I do hope Arthur you will follow his advice He looks a
fairly clever man But with a big practice Do you think dear he
quite realised the extent of thethe change

I told him what happened said her husbands voice out of the
bedclothes

Yes yes I know said Sheila soothingly but we must remember he is
comparatively a stranger He would not detect

What did he tell you asked the voice

Mrs Lawford deliberately considered If only he would always thus keep
his face concealed how much easier it would be to discuss matters
rationally You see dear she said softly I know of course
nothing about the nerves but personally I think his suggestion absurd
No mere fancy surely can make a lasting alteration in ones face And
your hairI dont want to say anything that may seem unkindbut isnt
it really quite a distinct shade darker Arthur

Any great strain will change the colour of a mans hair said Lawford
stolidly at any rate to white Why I read once of a fellow in India
a Hindoo or something who

But have you HAD any intense strain or anxiety broke in Sheila You
might at least have confided in me that is unlessBut there dont
you think really Arthur it would be much more satisfactory in every
way if we had further advice at once Alice will be home next week
Tomorrow is the Harvest Festival and next week of course the
Dedication and in any case the Bazaar is out of the question They
will have to find another stallholder We must do our utmost to avoid
comment or scandal Every minute must help toto fix a thing like that
I own even now I cannot realise what this awful calamity means Its
useless to brood on it We must as the poor dear old vicar said only
last night keep our heads clear But I am sure Dr Simon was under a
misapprehension If now it was explained to him a little more fully
Arthura photograph Oh anything on earth but this dreadful wearing
uncertainty and suspense Besides is Simon quite an English name

Lawford drew further into his pillow Do as you think best Sheila
he said For my own part I believe it may be as he suggestspartly an
illusion a touch of nervous breakdown It simply cant be as bad as I
think it is If it were you would not be here talking like this and
Bethany wouldnt have believed a word I said Whatever it is its no
good crying it on the housetops Give me time just time Besides how
do we know what he really thought Doctors dont tell their patients
everything Give the poor chap a chance and more so if he is a
foreigner Heshis voice sank almost to a whisperhes no darker
than this And do please Sheila take this infernal stuff away and
let me have something solid Im not illin that way All I want is
peace and quiet time to think Let me fight it out alone Its been
sprung on me The worsts not over But Ill win through wait And
if notwell you shall not suffer Sheila Dont be afraid There are
other ways out

Sheila broke down Any one would think to hear you talk that I was
perfectly heartless I told Ada to be most careful about the cornflour
And as for other ways out its a positively wicked thing to say to me
when Im nearly distracted with trouble and anxiety What motive could
you have had for loitering in an old cemetery And in an east wind Its
useless for me to remain here Arthur to be accused of every horrible
thing that comes into a morbid imagination I will leave you as you
suggest in peace

One moment Sheila answered the muffled voice I have accused you
of nothing If you knew all if you could read my thoughts you would
be surprised perhaps at myBut never mind that On the other hand I
really do think it would be better for the present to discuss the thing
no more Today is Friday Give this miserable face a week Talk it over
with Bethany if you like But I forbidhe struggled up in bed
sallow and sinisterI flatly forbid please understand any other
interference till then Afterwards you must do exactly as you please
Send round the Town Crier But till then silence

Sheila with raised head confronted him This then is your gratitude
So be it Silence no doubt Until its too late to take action Until
you have wormed your way in and think you are safe To have believed
Where is my husband that is what I am asking you now When and how you
have learned his secrets God only knows and your conscience But he
always was a simpleton at heart I warn you then Until next Thursday
I consent to say nothing provided you remain quiet make no disturbance
no scandal here The servants and all who inquire shall simply be told
that my husband is confined to his room withwith a nervous breakdown
as you have yourself so glibly suggested I am at your mercy I own it
The vicar believes your preposterous storywith his spectacles off
You would convince anybody with the wicked cunning with which you have
cajoled and wheedled him with which you have deceived and fooled a
foreign doctor But you will not convince me You will not convince
Alice I have friends in the world though you may not be aware of it
who will not be quite so apt to believe any cockandbull story you may
see fit to invent That is all I have to say Tonight I tell the vicar
all that I have just told you And from this moment please we are
strangers I shall come into the room no more than necessity dictates
On Friday we resume our real parts My husbandArthurtoto connive
at Phh

Rage had transfigured her She scarcely heard her own words They poured
out senselessly monotonously one calling up another as if from the
lips of a Cassandra Lawford sank back into bed clutching the sheets
with both lean hands He took a deep breath and shut his mouth

It reminds me Sheila he began arduously of our first quarrel
before we were married the evening after your aunt Rose died at
Llandudnodo you remember You threw open the window and I thinkI
saved your life A pause followed Then a queer almost inarticulate
voice added At least I am afraid so

A cold and awful quietness fell on Sheilas heart She stared fixedly
at the tuft of dark hair the only visible sign of her husband on the
pillow Then taking up the basin of cold cornflour she left the room
In a quarter of an hour she reappeared carrying a tray with ham and
eggs and coffee and honey invitingly displayed She laid it down

There is only one other question she said with perfect
composurethat of money Your signature as it appears on thethe
document drawn up this morning would of course be quite useless on
a cheque I have taken all the money I could find it is in safety
You may however conceivably be in need of some yourself here is five
pounds I have my own chequebook and shall therefore have no need
to consider the question again forfor the present So far as you are
concerned I shall be guided solely by Mr Bethany He will I do not
doubt take full responsibility

And may the Lord have mercy on my soul uttered a stifled unfamiliar
voice from the bed Mrs Lawford stooped Arthur she cried faintly
Arthur

Lawford raised himself on his elbow with a sigh that was very near to
being a sob Oh Sheila if youd only be your real self What is the
use of all this pretence Just consider MY position a little The fear
and horror are not all on your side You called me Arthur even then Id
willingly do anything you wish to save you pain you know that Cant we
be friends even in thisthis ghastlyWont you Sheila

Mrs Lawford drew back struggling with a doubtful heart

I think she said it would be better not to discuss that now

The rest of the morning Lawford remained in solitude



CHAPTER SIX

There were three books in the roomJeremy Taylors Holy Living and
Dying a volume of the Quiver and a little gilded book on wildflowers
He read in vain He lay and listened to the uproar of his thoughts on
which an occasional soundthe droning of a fly the cry of a milkman
the noise of a passing vanobtruded from the workaday world The pale
gold sunlight edged softly over the bed He ate up everything on his
tray He even on the shoals of nightmare dreamed awhile But by and
by as the hours wheeled slowly on he grew less calm less strenuously
resolved on lying there inactive Every sparrow that twittered cried
reveille through his brain He longed with an ardour strange to his
temperament to be up and doing

What if his misfortune was as he had in the excitement of the moment
suggested to Sheila only a morbid delusion of mind shared too in part
by sheer force of his absurd confession Even if he was going mad who
knows how peaceful a release that might not be Could his shrewd old
vicar have implicitly believed in him if the change were as complete
as he supposed it He flung off the bedclothes and locked the door
He dressed himself noticing he fancied with a deadly revulsion
of feeling that his coat was a little too short in the sleeves his
waistcoat too loose In the midst of his dressing came Sheila bringing
his luncheon Im sorry he called out stooping quickly beside the
bed I cant talk now Please put the tray down

About half an hour afterwards he heard the outer door close and peeping
from behind the curtains saw his wife go out All was drowsily quiet in
the house He devoured his lunch like a schoolboy That finished to the
last crumb without a moments delay he covered his face with a towel
locked the door behind him put the key in his pocket and ran lightly
downstairs He stuffed the towel into an ulster pocket put on a soft
widebrimmed hat and noiselessly let himself out Then he turned
with an almost hysterical delight and ranran like the wind without
pausing without thinking straight on up one turning down another
until he reached a broad open common thickly wooded sprinkled with
gorse and hazel and may and faintly purple with fading heather There
he flung himself down in the beautiful sunlight among the yellowing
bracken to recover his breath

He lay there for many minutes thinking almost with composure Flight
it seemed had for the moment quietened the demands of that other feebly
struggling personality which was beginning to insinuate itself into his
consciousness which had so miraculously broken in and taken possession
of his body He would not think now All he needed was a little quiet
and patience before he threw off for good and all his right to be free
to be his own master to call himself sane

He scrambled up and turned his face towards the westering sun What was
there in the stillness of its beautiful splendour that seemed to sharpen
his horror and difficulty and yet to stir him to such a daring and
devilry as he had never known since he was a boy There was little sound
of life somewhere an unknown bird was singing and a few late bees were
droning in the bracken All these years he had like an old blind horse
stolidly plodded round and round in a dull selfset routine And now
just when the spirit had come for rebellion the mood for a harmless
truancy there had fallen with them too this hideous enigma He sat
there with the dusky silhouette of the face that was now drenched with
sunlight in his minds eye He set off again up the stony incline

Why not walk on and on In time real wholesome weariness would come he
could sleep at ease in some pleasant wayside inn without once meeting
the eyes that stood as it were like a window between himself and a
shrewd incredulous scoffing world that would turn him into a monstrosity
and his story into a fable And in a little while perhaps in three
days he would awaken out of this engrossing nightmare and know he
was free this black dog gone from his back and as the old saying
expressed it without any one dreaming what it really meant his own
man again How astonished Sheila would be how warmly she would welcome
him Oh yes of course she would

He came again to a standstill No voice answered him out of that
illimitable gold and blue Nothing seemed aware of him But as he stood
there doubtful as Cain on the outskirts of the unknown he caught the
sound of a footfall on the lonely and stonestrewn path

The ground sloped steeply away to the left and slowly mounting the
hillside came mildly on an old lady he knew a Miss Sinnet an old
friend of his mothers There was just such a little seat as that
other he knew so well on the brow of the hill He made his way to it
intending to sit quietly there until the little old lady had passed by
Up and up she came Her large bonnet appeared and then her mild white
face inclined a little towards him as she ascended Evidently this very
seat was her goal and evasion was impossible Evasion Memory rushed
back and set his pulses beating He turned boldly to the sun and the
old lady with a brief glance into his face composed herself at the
other end of the little seat She gazed out of a gentle reverie into the
golden valley And so they sat a while And almost as if she had
felt the bond of acquaintance between them she presently sighed and
addressed him A very very beautiful view sir

Lawford paused then turned a gloomy earnest face gilded with
sunshine Beautiful indeed he said but not for me No Miss
Sinnet not for me

The old lady gravely turned and examined the aquiline profile Well I
confess she remarked urbanely you have the advantage of me

Lawford smiled uneasily Believe me it is little advantage

My sight said Miss Sinnet precisely is not so good as I might wish
though better perhaps than I might have hoped I fear I am not much
wiser your face is still unfamiliar to me

It is not unfamiliar to me said Lawford Whose trickery was this he
thought putting such affected stuff into his mouth

A faint lightening of pity came into the silvery and scrupulous
countenance Ah dear me yes she said courteously

Lawford rested a lean hand on the seat And have you he asked not
the least recollection in the world of my face

Now really she said smiling blandly is that quite fair Think of
all the scores and scores of faces in seventy long years and how very
treacherous memory is You shall do me the service of REMINDING me of
one whose name has for the moment escaped me

I am the son of a very old friend of yours Miss Sinnet said Lawford
quietly a friend that was once your schoolfellow at Brighton

Well now said the old lady grasping her umbrella that is
undoubtedly a clue but then you see all but one of the friends of my
girlhood are dead and if I have never had the pleasure of meeting her
son unless there is a decided resemblance how am I to recollect HER by
looking at HIM

There is I believe a likeness said Lawford

She nodded her great bonnet at him with gentle amusement You are
insistent in your fancy Well let me think again The last to leave
me was Fanny Urquhart that waslet me seelast October Now you are
certainly not Fanny Urquharts son she stooped austerely for she
never had one Last year too I heard that my dear dear Mrs Jameson
was dead HER I hadnt met for many many years But if I may venture
to say so yours is not a Scottish face and she not only married a
Scottish husband but was herself a Dunbar No I am still at a loss

A miserable strife was in her chance companions mind a strife of anger
and recrimination He turned his eyes wearily to the fast declining sun
You will forgive my persistency but I assure you it is a matter of
life or death to me Is there no one my face recalls My voice

Miss Sinnet drew her long lips together her eyebrows lifted with the
faintest perturbation But he certainly knows my name she said to
herself She turned once more and in the still autumnal beauty beneath
that pale blue arch of evening these two human beings confronted
one another again She eyed him blandly yet with a certain grave
directness

I dont really think she said you can be Mary Lawfords son I
could scarcely have mistaken HIM

Lawford gulped and turned away He hardly knew what this surge of
feeling meant Was it hope despair resentment had he caught even the
echo of an unholy joy His mind for a moment became confused as if
in the tumult of a struggle He heard himself expostulate Ah Miss
Bennett I fear I set you too difficult a task

The old lady drew abruptly in like a trustful and gentle snail into its
shocked house Bennett sir but my name is not Bennett

And again Lawford accepted the miserable prompting Not Bennett How
can I ever then apologise for so frantic a mistake

The little old lady took firm hold of her umbrella She did not answer
him The likeness the likeness he began unctuously and stopped
for the glance that dwelt fleetingly on him was cold with the formidable
dignity and displeasure of age He raised his hat and turned miserably
home He strode on out of the last gold into the blue twilight What
fantastic foolery of mind was mastering him He cast a hurried look
over his shoulder at the kindly and offended old figure sitting there
solitary on the little seat in her great bonnet with back turned
resolutely upon himthe friend of his dead mother who might have proved
in his need a friend indeed to him And he had by this insane caprice
hopelessly estranged her

She would remember this face well enough now he thought bitterly
and would take her place among his quiet enemies if ever the day of
reckoning should come It was scandalous it was banal to have abused
her trust and courtesy Oh it was hopeless to struggle any more The
fates were against him They had played him a trick He was to be their
transitory sport as many a better man he could himself recollect had
been before him He would go home and give in let Sheila do with him
what she pleased No one but a lunatic could have acted as he had with
just that frantic hint of method so remarkable in the insane

He left the common A lamplighter was lighting the lamps A thin
evening haze was on the air If only he had stayed at home that fateful
afternoon Who what had induced him enticed him to venture out And
even with the thought welled up into his mind an intense desire to go
to the old green timeworn churchyard again to sit there contentedly
alone where none heeded the completest metamorphosis down beside the
yewtrees What a fool he had been There alone of course lay his only
possible chance of recovery He would go tomorrow Perhaps Sheila had
not yet discovered his absence and there would be no difficulty in
repeating so successful a stratagem

Remembrance of his miserable mistake of Miss Sinnet faintly returned
to him as he swiftly mounted the steps to his porch Poor old lady He
would make amends for his discourtesy when he was quite himself again
She should some day hear perhaps his infinitely tragic infinitely
comic experience from his own lips He would take her some flowers some
old keepsake of his mothers What would he not do when the old moods
and brains of the stupid Arthur Lawford whom he had appreciated so
little and so superficially came back to him

He ran up the steps and stopped dead his hand in his pocket chilled
and aghast Sheila had taken his keys He stood there dazed and still
beneath the dim yellow of his own fanlight and once again that inward
spring flew back Brazen it out brazen it out Knock and ring

He knocked flamboyantly and rang

There came a quiet step and the door opened Dr Simon of course has
called he inquired suavely

Yes sir

Ah and goneas I feared And Mrs Lawford

I think Mrs Lawford is in sir

Lawford put out a detaining hand We will not disturb her we will not
disturb her I can find my way up oh yes thank you

But Ada still palely barred the way I think sir she said Mrs
Lawford would prefer to see you herself she told me most particularly
all callers And Mr Lawford was not to be disturbed on any account

Disturbed God forbid said Lawford but his dark eyes failed to
move these lightest hazel Well he continued nonchalantly
perhapsperhaps itWOULD be as well if Mrs Lawford should know that
I am here No thank you I wont come in Please go and tell
But even as the maid turned to obey Sheila herself appeared at the
diningroom door in hat and veil

Lawford hesitated an immeasurable moment In one swift glance
he perceived the lamplit mystery of evening beckoning calling
pleadingFly fly Homes here for you Begin again begin again And
there before him in quiet and hostile decorum stood maid and mistress
He took off his hat and stepped quickly in

So late so very late I fear he began glibly A sudden call a
perfectly impossible distance Shall we disturb him do you think

Wouldnt it began Sheila softly be rather a pity perhaps Dr Simon
seemed to think But of course you must decide that

Ada turned quiet small eyes

No no by no means he almost mumbled

And a hard slow smile passed over Sheilas face Excuse me one
moment she said I will see if he is awake She swept swiftly
forward superb and triumphant beneath the gaze of those dark restless
eyes But so still was home and street that quite distinctly a clear
and youthful laughter was heard and light footsteps approaching Sheila
paused Ada in the act of closing the door peered out Miss Alice
maam she said

And in this infinitesimal advantage of time Dr Ferguson had seized his
vanishing opportunity and was already swiftly mounting the stairs Mrs
Lawford stood with veil half raised and coldly smiling lips and as if
it were by prearrangement her daughters laughing greeting from the
garden and from the landing above her a faint Ah and how are we
now broke out simultaneously And Ada silent and discreet had thrown
open the door again to the twilight and to the young people ascending
the steps

Lawford was still sitting on his bed before a cold and ashy hearth when
Sheila knocked at the door

Yes he said whos there No answer followed He rose with a
shuddering sigh and turned the key His wife entered

That little exhibition of finesse was part of our agreement I
suppose

I say began Lawford

To creep out in my absence like a thief and to return like a
mountebank that was part of our compact

I say he stubbornly began again did you wire for Alice

Will you please answer my question Am I to be a mere catspaw in your
intrigues in this miserable masquerade before the servants To set the
whole place ringing with the name of a doctor that doesnt exist and
a bedridden patient that slips out of the house with his bedroom key in
his pocket Are you aware that Ada has been hammering at your door
every halfhour of your absence Are you aware of that How much
she continued in a low bitter voice how much should I offer for her
discretion

Who was that with Alice inquired the same toneless voice

I refuse to be ignored I refuse to be made a child of Will you please
answer me

Lawford turned Look here Sheila he began heavily what about
Alice If you wired well its useless to say anything more But if you
didnt I ask you just this one thing Dont tell her

Oh I perfectly appreciate a fathers natural anxiety

Her husband drew up his shoulders as if to receive a blow Yes yes
he said but you wont

The sound of a young laughing voice came faintly up from below How did
Jimmie Fortescue know she was coming home today

Will you not inquire of Jimmie Fortescue for yourself

Oh what is the use of sneering began the dull voice again I am
horribly tired Sheila And try how you will you cant convince me that
you believe for a moment that I am not myself that you are as hard
as you pretend An acquaintance even a friend might be deceived but
husband and wifeoh no It isnt only a mans face thats himselfor
even his hands He looked at them straightened them slowly out and
buried them in his pockets All I care about now is Alice Is she or
is she not going to be told I am simply asking you to give her just a
chance

Simply asking me to give Alice a chance now isnt that really just a
little

Lawford slowly shook his head You know in your heart it isnt Sheila
you understand me quite well although you persistently pretend not to
I cant argue now I cant speak up for myself I am just about as far
down as I can go Its only Alice

I see a lucid interval suggested his wife in a low trembling voice

Yes yes if you like said her husband patiently a lucid
interval Dont please look at my face like that Sheila Thinkthink
that its just lupus just some horrible disfigurement

Not much light was in the large room and there was something so
extraordinarily characteristic of her husband in those stooping
shoulders in the head hung a little forward and in the preternaturally
solemn voice that Sheila had to bend a little over the bed to catch a
glimpse of the sallow and keener face again She sighed and even on her
own strained ear her sigh sounded almost like one of relief

Its useless I know to ask you anything while you are in this mood
continued Lawford dully I know that of old

The white ringed hands clenched Of old

I didnt mean anything Dont listen to what I say Its onlyits
just Alice knowing that was all I mean at once

Dont for a moment suppose I am not perfectly aware that it is only
Alice you think of You were particularly anxious about my feelings
werent you You broke the news to me with the tenderest solicitude I
am glad ourour daughter shares my husbands love

Look here said Lawford densely you know that I love you as much as
ever but with thisas I am what would be the good of my saying so
Mrs Lawford took a deep breath

And a voice called softly at the door Mother are you there Is father
awake May I come in

In a flash the memory returned to her twentyfour hours ago she was
asking that very question of this unspeakable figure that sat hunchedup
before her

One moment dear she called And added in a very low voice Come
here

Lawford looked up What he said

Perhaps perhaps she whispered it isnt quite so bad

For mercys sake Sheila he said dont torture me tell the poor
child to go away

She paused Are you there Alice Would you mind father says waiting
a little He is so very tired

Too tired to Oh very well mother

Mrs Lawford opened the door and called after her Is Jimmie gone

Oh yes hours

Where did you meet

I couldnt get a carriage at the station He carried my dressingbag
I begged him not to The others coming on You know what Jimmie is
How very very lucky I did come home I dont know what made me just an
impulse they did laugh at me so Father deardo speak to me how are
you now

Lawford opened his mouth gulped and shook his head

Ssh dear whispered Sheila I think he has fallen asleep I will
be down in a minute Mrs Lawford was about to close the door when Ada
appeared

If you please maam she said I have been waiting as you told me
to let Dr Ferguson out but its nearly seven now and the tables not
laid yet

I really should have thought Ada Sheila began then caught back the
angry words and turned and looked over her shoulder into the room
Do you think you will need anything more Dr Ferguson she asked in a
sepulchral voice

Again Lawfords lips moved again he shook his head

One moment Ada she said closing the door Some more medicinewhat
medicine Quick She mustnt suspect

What medicine repeated Lawford stolidly

Oh vexing vexing dont you see we must send her out Dont you see
What was it you sent to Critchetts for last night Tell him thats
gone we want more of that

Lawford stared heavily Oh yes yes he said thickly more of
that

Sheila with a shrug of extreme distaste and vexation hastily opened
the door Dr Ferguson wants a further supply of the drug which Mr
Critchett made up for Mr Lawford yesterday evening You had better go at
once Ada and please make as much haste as you possibly can

I say I say began Lawford but it was too late the door was shut

How I detest this wretched falsehood and subterfuge What could have
induced you

Yes said her husband what I think Ill be getting to bed again
Sheila I forgot I had been ill And now I do really feel very tired
But I should like to feelin spite of this hideousI should like to
feel we are friends Sheila

Sheila almost imperceptibly shuddered crossed the room and faced
the still almost lifeless mask I spoke she said in a low cold
difficult voiceI spoke in a temper this morning You must try to
understand what a shock it has been to me Now I own it frankly I
know you areArthur But God only knows how it frightens me
andandhorrifies me She shut her eyes beneath her veil They waited
on in silence a while

Poor boy she said at last lightly touching the loose sleeve be
brave it will all come right soon Meanwhile for Alices sake if
not for mine dont give way toto caprices and all that Keep quietly
here Arthur Andand forgive my impatience

He put out his hand as if to touch her Forgive you he said humbly
pushing it stubbornly back into his pocket again Oh Sheila the
forgiveness is all on your side You know I have nothing to forgive A
long silence fell between them

Then tonight at last began Sheila wearily drawing back we
say nothing to Alice except that you are too tiredjust nervous
prostrationto see her What we should do without this influenza I
cannot conceive Mr Bethany will probably look in on his way home and
then we can talk it overwe can talk it over again So long as you
are like this yourself in mind why IWhat is it now she broke off
querulously

If you please maam Mr Critchett says he doesnt know Dr Ferguson
his names not in the Directory and there must be something wrong with
the message and hes sorry but he must have it in writing because
there was more even in the first packet than he ought by rights to send
What shall I do if you please

Still looking at her husband Sheila listened quietly to the end and
then as if in inarticulate disdain she deliberately shrugged her
shoulders and went out to play her part unaided



CHAPTER SEVEN

Her husband turned wearily once more and drawing up a chair sat down in
front of the cold grate He realised that Sheila thought him as much
of a fool now as she had for the moment thought him an impostor or
something worse the night before That was at least something gained
He realised too in a vague way that the exuberance of mind that had
practically invented Dr Ferguson and outraged Miss Sinnet had quite
suddenly flickered out It was astonishing he thought with gaze
fixed innocently on the black coals that he should ever have done such
things He detested that kind of rot that jaunty theatrical pose so
many men prided their jackdaw brains on

And he sat quite still like a cat at a cranny listening as it
were for the faintest remotest stir that might hint at any return of
thisactivity It was the first really sane moment he had had since
the change Whatever it was that had happened at Widderstone was now
distinctly weakening in effect Why now perhaps He stole a thievish
look over his shoulder at the glass and cautiously drew finger and
thumb down that beaked nose Then he really quietly smiled a smile he
felt this abominable facial caricature was quite unused to the superior
Lawford smile of guileless contempt for the fanatical the fantastic
and the bizarre He wouldnt have sat with his feet on the fender before
a burntout fire

And the animosity of that he uttered only just under his breath
surprised even himself It actually did seem as if there were a chance
if only he kept cool and collected If the whole mind of a man was bent
on being one thing surely no power on earth certainly not on earth
could for long compel him to look another any more followed the
resplendent thought than vice versa

That in fact was the trick that had been in fitful fashion played him
since yesterday Obviously and apart altogether from his promise to
Sheila the best possible thing he could do would be to walk quietly
over to Widderstone tomorrow and like a child that has lost a penny
just make the attempt to reverse the process look at the graves read
the inscriptions on the weatherbeaten stones compose himself once more
to sleep on the little seat

Magic witchcraft possession and all thatwell Mr Bethany might
prefer to take it on the authority of the Bible if it was his duty But
it was at least mainly Old Testament stuff like polygamy Joshua and
the unclean beasts The unclean beasts It was simply as Simon had
said mainly an affair of the nerves like Indian jugglery He had heard
of dozens of such cases or similar cases And it was hardly likely
that cases even remotely like his own would be much bragged about or
advertised All those mysterious disappearances too which one
reads about so repeatedly What of them Even now he felt and glanced
swiftly behind him at the fancy it would be better to think as softly
as possible not to hope too openly certainly not to triumph in the
least degree just in case ofwelllisteners

He would wrap up too And he wouldnt tell Sheila of the project till
he had come safely back What an excellent joke it would be to confess
meekly to his escapade and to be scolded and then suddenly to reveal
himself He sat back and gazed with an almost malignant animosity at the
face in the portrait comely and plump

An inarticulate unfathomable depression rolled back on him like a
mist out of the sea He hastily undressed put watch and doorkey and
Critchetts powder under his pillow paused vacantly ruminated and
then replaced the powder in his waistcoat pocket said his prayers and
got shivering to bed He did not feel hurt at Sheilas leaving him like
this So long as she really believed in him And nowAlice was home He
listened trying not to shiver for her voice and sometimes heard he
fancied the clear note It was this beastly influenza that made him
feel so cold and lifeless But all would soon come rightthat is if
only that face luminous against the floating darkness within would not
appear the instant he closed his eyes

But legions of dreams are Influenzas allies He fell into a chill doze
heard voices innumerable and one above the rest shouting them down
until there fell a lull And another as it were from afar said quite
clearly and distinctly But surely my dear you have heard the story
of the poor old charwoman who talked Greek in her delirium A little
school French need not alarm us And Lawford opened his eyes again on
Mr Bethany standing at his bed

Tt tt There Ive been and waked him And yet they say men make such
excellent nurses in time of war But you see Lawford what did I tell
you Wasnt I now an infallible prophet Your wife has been giving me a
most glowing account Quite your old self she tells me except for just
thisthis touch of facial paralysis And I think do you know the
kind old creature stooped over the bed but still Lawford noticed
bitterly still without his spectaclesyes I really think there is
a decided improvement Not quite sodrawn We must make haste slowly
Wedderburn you know believes profoundly in Simon he pulled his
wife through a dangerous confinement And heres pills and tonics and
linimentsa whole chemists shop Oh we are getting on swimmingly

Flamelight was flickering in the candled dusk Lawford turned his head
and saw Sheilas coiled beautiful hair in the firelight

You havent told Alice he asked

My dear good man said Mr Bethany of course we havent You shall
tell her yourself on Monday What an incredible tradition it will be
But you mustnt worry you mustnt even think And no more of these
jaunts eh That Ferguson businessthat was too bad What are we going
to do with the fellow now we have created him He will come home to
roostmark my words And as likely as not down the Vicarage chimney
I wouldnt have believed it of you my dear fellow He beamed but
looked none the less very lean and fagged and depressed

How did the wedding go off Lawford managed to think of inquiring

Oh A1 said Mr Bethany Ive just been describing it to Alicethe
bride her bridegroom mother aunts cake presents finery blushes
tears and everything that was hers Weve been in fits havent we Mrs
Lawford And Alice says Im a Worth in a clerical collardidnt she
And that its only Art that has kept me out of an apron Now look here
quiet quiet quiet no excitement no pranks What is there to worry
about pray And now Little Dorrits down with influenza too And Craik
and I will have double work to do Well well goodbye my dear God
bless you Lawford I cant tell you how relieved how unspeakably
relieved I am to find you so muchso much better Feed him up my other
dear body and mind and soul and spirit And there goes the bell I must
have a biscuit Ive swallowed nothing but a Cupid in plaster of Paris
since breakfast Goodnight we shall miss you bothboth

But when Sheila returned her husband was sunk again into a quiet sleep
from which not even the many questions she fretted to put to him seemed
weighty enough to warrant his disturbance

So when Lawford again opened his eyes he found himself lying wide awake
clear and refreshed and eager to get up But upon the air lay the still
hush of early morning He tried in vain to catch back sleep again
A distant shred of dream still floated in his mind like a cloud
at evening He rarely dreamed but certainly something immensely
interesting had but a moment ago eluded him He sat up and looked at
the clear red cinders and their maze of grottoes He got out of bed and
peeped through the blinds To the east and opposite to him gardens and
an appleorchard lay and there in strange liquid tranquillity hung the
morning star and rose rifling into the dusk of night the first grey
of dawn The street beneath its autumn leaves was vacant charmed
deserted

Hardly since childhood had Lawford seen the dawn unless over his winter
breakfasttable Very much like a child now he stood gazing out of his
bowwindowthe child whom Times busy robins had long ago covered over
with the leaves of numberless hours A vague exultation fumed up into
his brain Still on the borders of sleep he unlocked the great wardrobe
and took out an old faded purple and crimson dressinggown that had
belonged to his grandfather the chief glory of every Christmas charade
He pulled the cowllike hood over his head and strode majestically over
to the lookingglass

He looked in there a moment on the strange face like a child dismayed
at its own excitement and a fit of sobbing that was half uncontrollable
laughter swept over him He threw off the hood and turned once more to
the window Consciousness had flooded back indeed What would Sheila
have said to see him there The unearthly beauty and stillness and
mans small labours garden and wall and rooftree idle and smokeless in
the light of daybreakthere seemed to be some halftold secret between
them What had life done with him to leave a reality so clouded He
put on his slippers and gently opening the door crept with extreme
caution up the stairs At a long narrow landing window he confronted
a panorama of starry nightgardens sloping orchards and beyond them
fields hills Orion the Dogs in the clear and cloudless darkness

My God how beautiful a voice whispered And a cock crowed mistily
afar He stood staring like a child into the wintry brightness of a
pastrycooks Then once more he crept stealthily on He stooped and
listened at a closed door until he fancied that above the beating of
his own heart he could hear the breathing of the sleeper within Then
taking firm hold of the handle with both hands he slowly noiselessly
turned it and peeped in on Alice

The moon was long past her faint shining here The blind was down And
yet it was not pitch dark He stood with eyes fixed waiting Then he
edged softly forward and knelt down beside the bed He could hear her
breathing now long low quiet unhasteningthe miracle of life He
could just dimly discern the darkness of her hair against the pillow
Some longsealed spring of tenderness seemed to rise in his heart with a
grief and an ache he had never known before Here at least he could find
a little peace a brief pause however futile and stupid all his hopes
of the night had been He leant his head on his hands on the counterpane
and refused to think He felt a quick tremor a startled movement and
knew that eyes wide open with fear were striving to pierce the gloom
between them

There there dearest he said in a low whisper its only me only
me He stroked the narrow hand and gazed into the shadowiness Her
fingers lay quiet and passive in his with that strange sense of
immateriality that sleep brings to the body

You you she answered with a deep sigh Oh dearest how you
frightened me What is wrong why have you come Are you worse dearest
dearest

He kissed her hand No Alice not worse I couldnt sleep that was
all

Oh and I came so utterly miserable to bed because you would not see
me And Mother would tell me only so very little I didnt even know
you had been ill She pressed his hand between her own But this you
know is very very naughtyyou will catch cold you bad thing What
would Mother say

I think we mustnt tell her dear I couldnt help it I felt much I
wanted to see you I have been rather miserable

Why she said stroking his hand from wrist to fingertips with one
soft finger You mustnt be miserable You and me have never done such
a thing before have we Was it that wretched old Flu

It was too dark in the little fragrant room even to see her face so
close to his own And yet he feared Dr Simon she went on softly
said it was But isnt your voice a little hoarse and it sounds so
melancholy in the dark And ohshe squeezed his wristyou have grown
so thin You do frighten me Whatever should I do if you were really
ill And it was so odd dear When first I woke I seemed to be still
straining my eyes in a dream at such a curious haunting facenot very
nice I am glad I am glad you were here

What was the dreamface like came the muttered question

Dark and sharp and rather dwelling eyes you know those long faces one
sees in dreams like a hawk like a conjurors

Like a conjurorsit was the first unguarded and ungarbled criticism
Perhaps dear if you find my voice different and my hand shrunk up
you will find my face changed toolike a conjurors What then

She laughed gaily and tenderly You silly silly I should love you more
than ever Your hands are icy cold I cant warm them nohow

Lawford held tight his daughters hand You do love me Alice You
would not turn against me whatever happened Ah you shall see you
shall see A sudden burning hope sprang up in him Surely when all was
well again these last few hours would not have been spent in vain
Like the shadow of death they had been against whose darkness the green
familiar earth seems beautiful as the plains of paradise Had he but
realized before how much he loved herwhat years of life had been
wasted in leaving it all unsaid He came back from his reverie to find
his hand wet with her tears He stroked her hair and touched gently her
eyelids without speaking

You will let me come in tomorrow she pleaded you wont keep me
out

Ah but dear you must remember your mother She gets so anxious and
every word the doctor says is law How would you like me to come again
like this perhapslike Santa Claus

You know how I love having you she said and stopped Butbut
He leaned closer Yes yes come she said clutching his hand and
hiding her eyes it is only my dreamthat horrible dwelling face in
the dream it frightened me so

Lawford rose very slowly from his knees He could feel in the dark his
brows drawn down there came a low sullen beating on his ear he saw
his face as it were in dim outline against the dark Rage and rebellion
surged up in him even his love could be turned to bitterness Well two
could play at any game Alice sprang up in bed and caught his sleeve
Dearest dearest you must not be angry with me now

He flung himself down beside the bed Anger resentment died away You
are all I have left he said

He stole back as he had come in the clear dawn to his bedroom

It was not five yet He put a few more coals on his fire and blew out
the nightlight and lay down But it was impossible to rest to remain
inactive He would go down and search for that first volume of Quain
Hallucination Influenza Insanitywhy Sheila must have purposely
mislaid it A rather formidable figure he looked descending the stairs
in the grey dusk of daybreak The breakfastroom was at the back of
the house He tilted the blind and a faint light flowed in from the
changing colours of the sky He opened the glass door of the little
bookcase to the right of the window and ran eye and finger over the few
rows of books But as he stood there with his back to the room just as
the shadow of a birds wing floats across the moonlight of a pool he
became suddenly conscious that something somebody had passed across the
doorway and in passing had looked in on him

He stood motionless listening but no sound broke the morning
slumbrousness except the faraway warbling of a thrush in the first
light So sudden and transitory had been the experience that it seemed
now to be illusory yet it had so caught him up it had with so furtive
and sinister a quietness broken in on his solitude that for a moment he
dared not move A cold indefinite sensation stole over him that he was
being watched that some dim evil presence was behind him biding its
time patient and stealthy with eyes fixed unmovingly on him where
he stood But watch and wait as silently as he might only the day
broadened at the window and at last a narrow ray of sunlight stole
trembling up into the dusky bowl of the sky

At any rate Quain was found with all the ills of life from A to I and
Lawford turned back to his bondage with the book under his arm



CHAPTER EIGHT

The Sabbath pale with September sunshine and monotonous with chiming
bells had passed languidly away Dr Simon had come and gone optimistic
and urbane yet with a faint inward dissatisfaction over a patient
behind whose taciturnity a hint of mockery and subterfuge seemed to
lurk Even Mrs Lawford had appeared to share her husbands reticence
But Dr Simon had happened on other cases in his experience where tact
was required rather than skill and time than medicine

The voices and footsteps even the froufrou of worshippers going to
church the voices and footsteps of worshippers returning from church
had floated up to the patients open window Sunlight had drawn across
his room in one pale beam and vanished A few callers had called
Hothouse flowers waxen and pale had been left with messages of
sympathy Even Dr Critchett had respectfully and discreetly made
inquiries on his way home from chapel

Lawford had spent most of his time in pacing to and fro in his soft
slippers The very monotony had eased his mind Now and again he had
lain motionless with his face to the ceiling He had dozed and had
awakened cold and torpid with dream He had hardly been aware of
the process but every hour had done something it seemed towards
clarifying his point of view A consciousness had begun to stir in him
that was neither that of the old easy Lawford whom he had never been
fully aware of before nor of this strange ghostly intelligence that
haunted the hawklike restless face and plucked so insistently at his
distracted nerves He had begun in a vague fashion to be aware of them
both could in a fashion discriminate between them almost as if there
really were two spirits in stubborn conflict within him It would of
course wear him down in time There could be only one end to such a
struggleTHE end

All day he had longed for freedom on and on with craving for the open
sky for solitude for green silence beyond these maddening walls This
heedful silken coming and going these Sunday voices this reiterant
yelp of a single peevish bellwould they never cease And above all
betwixt dread and an almost physical greed he hungered for night He
sat down with elbows on knees and head on his hands thinking of night
its secrecy its immeasurable solitude

His eyelids twitched the fire before him had for an instant gone black
out He seemed to see slowgesturing branches grass stooping beneath
a grey and windswept sky He started up and the remembrance of the
morning returned to himthe glassy light the changing rays the
beaming gilt upon the useless books Now at last at the windows
afternoon had begun to wane And when Sheila brought up his tea as if
Chance had heard his cry she entered in hat and stole She put down the
tray and paused at the glass looking across it out of the window

Alice says you are to eat every one of those delicious sandwiches and
especially the tiny omelette You have scarcely touched anything today
Arthur I am a poor one to preach I am afraid but you know what that
will meana worse breakdown still You really must try to think ofof
us all

Are you going to church he asked in a low voice

Not of course if you would prefer not But Dr Simon advised me most
particularly to go out at least once a day We must remember this is
not the beginning of your illness Longcontinued anxiety I suppose
does tell on one in time Anyhow he said that I looked worried and
rundown I AM worried Let us both try for each others sakes or even
if only for Alices toto do all we can I must not harass you but is
there anydo you see the slightest change of any kind

You always look pretty Sheila tonight you look prettier THAT is the
only change I think

Mrs Lawfords attitude intensified in its stillness Now speaking
quite frankly what is it in you suggests these remarks at such a time
Thats what baffles me It seems so childish so needlessly blind

I am very sorry Sheila to be so childish But Im not say what
you like blind You ARE pretty Id repeat it if I was burning at the
stake

Sheila lowered her eyes softly on to the richtoned picture in the
glass Supposing she said watching her lips move supposingof
course I know you are getting better and all thatbut supposing you
dont change back as Mr Bethany thinks what will you do Honestly
Arthur when I think over it calmly the whole tragedy comes back on me
with such a force it sweeps me off my feet I am for the moment scarcely
my own mistress What would you do

I think Sheila replied a low infinitely weary voice I think I
should marry again It was the same wavering faintly ironical voice
that had slightly discomposed Dr Simon that same morning

Marry again exclaimed incredulously the full lips in the
lookingglass Who

YOU dear

Sheila turned softly round conscious in a most humiliating manner that
she had ever so little flushed

Her husband was pouring out his tea unaware apparently of her change
of position She watched him curiously In spite of all her reason of
her absolute certainty she wondered even again for a moment if this
really could be Arthur And for the first time she realised the power
and mastery of that eager and far too hungry face Her mind seemed to
pause fluttering in air like a bird in the wind She hastened rather
unsteadily to the door

Will you want anything more do you think for an hour she asked

Her husband looked up over his little table Is Alice going with you

Oh yes poor child she looks so pale and miserable We are going to
Mrs Sherwins and then on to Church You will lock your door

Yes I will lock my door

And I do hope Arthurnothing rash

A change that seemed almost the effect of actual shadow came over his
face I wish you could stay with me he said slowly I dont think
you have any idea whatwhat I go through

It was as if a child had asked on the verge of terror for a candle in
the dark But an hours terror is better than a lifetime of timidity
Sheila sighed

I think she said I too might say that But there giving way will
do nothing for either of us I shall be gone only for an hour or two
at the most And I told Mr Bethany I should have to come out before the
sermon its only Mr Craik

But why Mrs Sherwin Shed worm a secret out of ones grave

Its useless to discuss that Arthur you have always consistently
disliked my friends Its scarcely likely that you would find any
improvement in them now

Oh well he began But the door was already closed

Sheila he called in a burst of anger

Well Arthur

You have taken my latchkey

Sheila came hastily in again Your latchkey

I am going out

Going outyou will not be so mad so criminal and after your
promise

He stood up It is useless to argue If I do not go out I shall
certainly go mad As for criminalwhy thats a womans word Who on
earth is to know me

It is of no consequence then that the servants are already gossiping
about this impossible Dr Ferguson that you are certain to be seen
either going or returning that Alice is bound to discover that you are
well enough to go out and yet not even enough to say goodnight to your
own daughteroh its monstrous its a frantic a heartless thing to
do Her voice vaguely suggested tears

Lawford eyed her coldly and stubbornlythinking of the empty room
he would leave awaiting his return its lamp burning its fireflames
shining It was almost a physical discomfort this longing unspeakable
for the twilight the green secrecy and the silence of the graves Keep
them out of the way he said in a low voice it will be dark when I
come in His hardened face lit up Its useless to attempt to dissuade
me

Why must you always be hurting me why do you seem to delight in trying
to estrange me Husband and wife faced each other across the clearlit
room He did not answer

For the last time she said in a quiet hard voice I ask you not to
go

He shrugged his shoulders Ask me not to come back he said thats
nearer your hope He turned his face to the fire Without moving
he heard her go out return pause and go out again And when he
deliberately wheeled round in his chair the little key lay conspicuous
there on the counterpane



CHAPTER NINE

The last light of sunset lay in the west and a sullen wrack of cloud
was mounting into the windless sky when Lawford entered the country
graveyard again by its dark weatherworn lychgate The old stone church
with its square tower stood amid trees its eastern window faintly aglow
with crimson and purple He could hear a steady rather nasal voice
through its open lattices But the stooping stones and the cypresses
were out of sight of its porch He would not be seen down there He
paused a moment however his hat was drawn down over his eyes he was
shivering Far over the harvest fields showed a growing pallor in
the solitary seat beneath the cypresses He stood hesitating gazing
steadily and yet half vacantly at the motionless figure and in a while
a face was lifted in his direction and undisconcerted eyes calmly
surveyed him

I am afraid called Lawford rather nervouslyI hope I am not
intruding

Not at all not at all said the stranger I have no privileges here
at least as yet

Lawford again hesitated then slowly advanced Its astonishingly quiet
and beautiful he said

The stranger turned his head to glance over the fields Yes it is
very he replied There was the faintest accent a little drawl of
unfriendliness in the remark

You often sit here Lawford persisted

The stranger raised his eyebrows Oh yes often He smiled It is
my own modest fashion of attending divine service The congregation is
rapt

My visits said Lawford have been very fewin fact so far as I
know I have only once been here before

I envy you the novelty There was again the same faint unmistakable
antagonism in voice and attitude and yet so deep was the relief in
talking to a fellow creature who hadnt the least suspicion of anything
unusual in his appearance that Lawford was extremely disinclined to turn
back He made another effortfor conversation with strangers had always
been a difficulty to himand advanced towards the seat You mustnt
please let me intrude upon you he said but really I am very
interested in this queer old place Perhaps you would tell me something
of its history He sat down His companion moved slowly to the other
side of the broken gravestone

To tell you the truth he replied picking his way as it were from
word to word its history as people call it does not interest me
in the least After all its not when a thing is but what it is that
much matters What this ishe glanced with head bent across the
shadowy stones is pretty evident Of course age has its charms

And is this very old

Oh yes its old right enough as things go but even age perhaps
is mainly an affair of the imagination Theres a tombstone near that
little old hawthorn and there are two others side by side under the
wall still even legibly late seventeenth century Thats pretty
good weathering He smiled faintly Of course the church itself is
centuries older drenched with age But shes still sleepwalking while
these old tombstones dream Glowworms and crickets are not such bad
bedfellows

What interested me most I think said Lawford haltingly was this
He pointed with his stick to the grave at his feet

Ah yes Sabathiers said the stranger I know his peculiar history
almost by heart

Lawford found himself staring with unusual concentration into the
rather long and pale face Not I suppose he resumed faintlynot I
suppose beyond whats there

His companion leant his hand on the old stooping tombstone Well you
know theres a good deal therehe stooped overif you read between
the lines Even if you dont

A suicide said Lawford under his breath

Yes a suicide thats why our Christian countrymen have buried him
outside of the fold Dead or alive they try to keep the wolf out

Is this then unconsecrated ground said Lawford

Havent you noticed drawled the other how green the grass grows
down here and how very sharp are poor old Sabathiers thorns Besides
he was a stranger and theykept him out

But surely said Lawford was it so entirely a matter of choicethe
laws of the Church If he did kill himself he did

The stranger turned with a little shrug I dont suppose its a matter
of much consequence to HIM I fancied I was his only friend May I
venture to ask why you are interested in the poor old thing

Lawfords mind was as calm and shallow as a millpond Oh a rather
unusual thing happened to me here he said You say you often come

Often said the stranger rather curtly

Has anythingeveroccurred

Occurred He raised his eyebrows I wish it had I come here
simply as I have said because its quiet because I prefer the company
of those who never answer me back and who do not so much as condescend
to pay me the least attention He smiled and turned his face towards
the quiet fields

Lawford after a long pause lifted his eyes Do you think he said
softly it is possible one ever could

One ever could

Answer back

There was a low rotting wall of stone encompassing Sabathiers grave
on this the stranger sat down He glanced up rather curiously at his
companion Seldom the time and the place and the revenant altogether
The thought has occurred to others he ventured to add

Of course of course said Lawford eagerly But it is an absolutely
new one to me I dont mean that I have never had such an idea just in
ones own superficial way buthe paused and glanced swiftly into the
fastthickening twilightI wonder are they do you think really all
quite dead

Call and see taunted the stranger softly

Ah yes I know said Lawford But I believe in the resurrection of
the body that is what we say and supposing when a man diessupposing
it was most frightfully against ones will that one hated the awful
inaction that death brings shutting a poor devil up like a child
kicking against the door in a dark cupboard one might surely one
mightjust quietly you know try to get out wouldnt you he added

And surely he found himself beginning gently to argue again
surely what about say him He nodded towards the old and broken
grave that lay between them

What Sabathier the other echoed laying his hand upon the stone

And a sheer enormous abyss of silence seemed to follow the unanswerable
question

He was a stranger it says so Good God said Lawford how he must
have wanted to get home He killed himself poor wretch think of the
fret and fever he must have been injust before Imagine it

But it might you know suggested the other with a smilemight have
been sheer indifference

Nicholas Sabathier Stranger to this parishno no said Lawford
his heart beating as if it would choke him I dont fancy it was
indifference

It was almost too dark now to distinguish the strangers features but
there seemed a faint suggestion of irony in his voice And how do
you suppose your angry naughty child would set about it Its narrow
quarters how would he begin

Lawford sat quite still You sayI hope I am not detaining youyou
say you have come here sat here often on this very seat have you ever
hadhave you ever fallen asleep here

Why do you ask inquired the other curiously

I was only wondering said Lawford He was cold and shivering He felt
instinctively it was madness to sit on here in the thin gliding mist
that had gathered in swathes above the grass milkpale in the rising
moon The stranger turned away from him

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come must give us pause
he said slowly with a little satirical catch on the last word What
did you dream

Lawford glanced helplessly about him The moon cast lean grey beams
of light between the cypresses But to his wide and wandering eyes it
seemed that a radiance other than hers haunted these mounds and leaning
stones Have you ever noticed it he said putting out his hand
towards his unknown companion this stone is cracked from head to
foot But therehe rose stiff and chilledI am afraid I have
bored you with my company You came here for solitude and I have been
trying to convince you that we are surrounded with witnesses You will
forgive my intrusion There was a kind of oldfashioned courtesy in his
manner that he himself was dimly aware of He held out his hand

I hope you will think nothing of the kind said the other earnestly
how could it be in any sense an intrusion Its the old story of
Bluebeard And I confess I too should very much like a peep into his
cupboard Who wouldnt But there its merely a matter of time I
suppose He paused and together they slowly ascended the path already
glimmering with a heavy dew At the porch they paused once more And now
it was the stranger that held out his hand

Perhaps he said you will give me the pleasure of some day
continuing our talk As for our friend below it so happens that I have
managed to pick up a little more of his history than the sexton seems to
have heard ofif you would care some time or other to share it I live
only at the foot of the hill not half a mile distant Perhaps you could
spare the time now

Lawford took out his watch You are really very kind he said But
perhapswell whatever that history may be I think you would agree
that mine is evenbut there Ive talked too much about myself
already Perhaps tomorrow

Why tomorrow then said his companion Its a flat wooden house
on the lefthand side Come at any time of the evening he paused again
and smiledthe third house after the Rectory which is marked up on
the gate My name is HerbertHerbert Herbert to be precise

Lawford took out his pocketbook and a card Mine he said handing
it gravely to his companion is Lawfordat least It was really the
first time that either had seen the others face at close quarters and
clearlit and on Lawfords a moon almost at the full shone
dazzlingly He saw an expressiondismay incredulity overwhelming
astonishmentstart suddenly into the dark rather indifferent eyes

What is it he cried hastily stooping close

Why said the other laughing and turning away I think the moon must
have bewitched me too



CHAPTER TEN

Lawford listened awhile before opening his door He heard voices in the
diningroom A light shone faintly between the blinds of his bedroom He
very gently let himself in and unheard unseen mounted the stairs He
sat down in front of the fire tired out and bitterly cold in spite
of his long walk home But his mind was wearier even than his body He
tried in vain to catch up the thread of his thoughts He only knew for
certain that so far as his first hope and motives had gone his errand
had proved entirely futile How could I possibly fall asleep with that
fellow talking there he had said to himself angrily yet knew in his
heart that their talk had driven every other idea out of his mind He
had not yet even glanced into the glass His every thought was vainly
wandering round and round the one curious hint that had drifted in but
which he had not yet been able to put into words

Supposing though that he had really fallen into a deep sleep with
none to watch or spywhat then However ridiculous that idea it was
not more ridiculous more incredible than the actual fact If he had
remained there he might it was just possible that he would by now
have actually awakened just his own familiar everyday self again And
the thought of thatthough he hardly realised its full importactually
did send him on tiptoe for a glance that more or less effectually set
the question at rest And there looked out at him it seemed the
same dark sallow face that had so much appalled him only two nights
agoexpressionless cadaverous with shadowy hollows beneath the
glittering eyes And even as he watched it its lips of their own
volition drew together and questioned himWhose

He was not to be given much leisure however for fantastic reveries
like this As he leaned his head on his hands gladly conscious that he
could not possibly bear this incessant strain for long Sheila opened
the door He started up

I wish you would knock he said angrily you talk of quiet you tell
me to rest and think and here you come creeping and spying on me as
if I was a child in a nursery I refuse to be watched and guarded and
peeped on like this He knew that his hands were trembling that he
could not keep his eyes fixed that his voice was nearly inarticulate

Sheila drew in her lips I have merely come to tell you Arthur that
Mr Bethany has brought Mr Danton in to supper He agrees with me it
really would be advisable to take such a very old and prudent and
practical friend into our confidence You do nothing I ask of you I
simply cannot bear the burden of this incessant anxiety Look now what
your night walk has done for you You look positively at deaths door

Whatwhat an instinct you have for the right word said Lawford
softly And Danton of all people in the world It was surely rather a
curious a thoughtless choice Has he had supper

Why do you ask

He wont believe toobloated

I think said Sheila indignantly it is hardly fair to speak of a
very old and a very true friend of mine in suchwell vulgar terms as
that Besides Arthur as for believingwithout in the least desiring
to hurt your feelingsI must candidly warn you some people wont

Come along said Lawford with a faint gust of laughter lets see

They went quickly downstairs Sheila with less dignity perhaps than
she had been surprised into since she had left a slimmer girlhood
behind She swept into the gaze of the two gentlemen standing together
on the hearthrug and so was caught as it were between a rain of
conflicting glances for her husband had followed instantly and stood
now behind her stooping a little and with something between contempt
and defiance confronting an old fat friend whom that one brief
challenging instant had congealed into a condition of passive and
immovable hostility

Mr Danton composed his chin in his collar and deliberately
turned himself towards his companion His small eyes wandered and
instantaneously met and rested on those of Mrs Lawford

Arthur thought he would prefer to come down and see you himself

You take such formidable risks Lawford said Mr Bethany in a dry
difficult voice

Am I really to believe Danton began huskily I am sure Bethany
you willMy dear Mrs Lawford said he stirring vaguely glancing
restlessly

It was not my wish Vicar to come at all said a voice from the
doorway To tell you the truth I am too tired to care a jot either
way Andhe lifted a long armI must positively refuse to produce
the least the remotest proof that I am not so far as I am personally
aware even the Man in the Moon Danton at heart was always an
incorrigible sceptic Arent you T D You pride your dear old brawn
on it in secret

I really began Danton in a rich still voice

Oh but you know you are drawled on the slightly hesitating
longdrawn syllables its your parochial metier Firm unctuous
subtle scepticism and to that end your body flourishes You were born
fat you became fat and fat my dear Danton has been deliberately
thrust on youin layers Lampreys Youll perish of surfeit some day
of sheer Dantonism And fat postmortem Danton Oh what a bastings
there

Mr Bethany with a convulsive effort woke He turned swiftly on Mrs
Lawford Why why could you not have seen he cried

Its no good Vicar Shes all sheer Laodicean Blow hot blow cold
North south east westto have a weathercock for a wife is to marry
the wind Theres nothing to be got from poor Sheila but

Lawford the little mans voice was as sharp as the crack of a whip
I forbid it Do you hear me I forbid it Some selfcommand my dear
good fellow remember remember its only the will the will that keeps
us breathing

Lawford peered as if out of a gathering dusk that thickened and
flickered with shadows before his eyes Whats he mean then he
muttered huskily coming here with his black still carcasepeeping
peepingwhats he mean I say There was a moments silence Then with
lifted brows and wide eyes that to every one of his three witnesses
left an indelible memory of clear and wolfish light within their glassy
pupils he turned heavily and climbed back to his solitude

I suppose began Danton with an obvious effort to disentangle himself
from the humiliation of the moment I suppose he waswandering

Bless me yes said Mr Bethany cordiallyfever We all know what
that MEANS

Yes said Danton taking refuge in Mrs Lawfords white and intent
gaze

Just think think Dantonthe awful incessant strain of such an
ordeal Think for an instant what such a thing means

Danton inserted a plump white finger between collar and chin Oh yes
Butehneedlessly abusive I never SAID I disbelieved him

Do you said Mrs Lawfords voice

He poised himself as if it were on the monolithic stability of his
legs Eh he said

Mr Bethany sat down at the table I rather feared some such temporary
breakdown as this Danton I think I foresaw it And now just while we
are all three alone here together in friendly conclave wouldnt it be
as well dont you think to confront ourselves with the difficulties
I knowwe all know that that poor halfdemented creature IS Arthur
Lawford This morning he was as sane as lucid as I hope I am now An
awful calamity has suddenly fallen upon himthis change I own frankly
at the first sheer shock it staggered me as I think for the moment it
has staggered you But when I had seen the poor fellow face to face
heard him talk and watched him there upstairs in the silence stir and
awake and come up again to his trouble out of his sleep I had no more
doubt in my own mind and heart that he was he than I have in my mind
that Iam I We do in some mysterious way youll own at once grow so
accustomed so inured if you like to each others faces masks
though they be that we hardly realise we see them when we are speaking
together And yet the slightest the most infinitesimal change is
instantly apparent

Oh yes Vicar but you see

Mr Bethany raised a small lean hand One moment please I have heard
Lawfords own account Conscious or unconscious he has been through
some terrific strain some such awful conflict with the unseen powers
that wethank Godhave only read about and never perhaps until
death is upon us shall witness for ourselves What more likely more
inevitable than that such a thing should leave its scar its cloud its
masking shadowcall it what you will A smile can turn a face we dread
into a face wed die for Some experience which would be nothing but
a hideous cruelty and outrage to ask too closely aboutone perhaps
which he could even if he would poor fellow give no account ofhas
put him temporarily at the worlds mercy They made him a nine days
wonder a byword And that my dear Danton is just where we come in
We know the man himself and it is to be our privilege to act as a
bufferstate to be intermediaries between him and the rest of this
deadly craving sheepish worldfor the time being oh yes just for
the time being Other and keener and more knowledgeable minds than mine
or yours will some day bring him back to us again We dont attempt to
explain we cant We simply believe

But Danton merely continued to stare as if into the quiet of an
aquarium

My dear good Danton persisted Mr Bethany with cherubic patience how
old are you

I dont see quite smiled Danton with recovered ease and
rapidly mobilising forces Excuse the confidence Mrs Lawford Im
fortythree

Good said Mr Bethany and Im seventyone and this child herehe
pointed an accusing finger at Sheilais youth perpetual So he
briskly brightened say between us were six score all told Are
wecan we deliberately with this mere pinch of years at our command
out of the wheeling millions that have gonecan we say This is
impossible to any single phenomenon CAN we

No we cant of course said Danton formidably Not finally Thats
all very well buthe paused and nodded nodding his round head
upward as if towards the inaudible overhead I suppose he cant HEAR

Mr Bethany rose cheerfully All right Danton I am afraid you are
exactly what the poor fellow in his delirium solemnly asseverated
And jesting apart it is in delirium that we tell our sheer plain
unadulterated truth youre a nicely covered sceptic Personally I
refuse to discuss the matter Mere dull stubborn prejudice bigotry if
you like I will only remark just thisthat Mrs Lawford and I in our
inmost hearts know You my dear Danton forgive the freedom merely
incredulously grope Faith versus Reasonthat prehistoric Armageddon
Some day and a day not far distant either Lawford will come back
to us Thisthis shutter will be taken down as abruptly as by some
inconceivably drowsy heedlessness of common Nature it has been put
up Hell win through and of his own sheer will and courage But now
because I ask it and this poor child here entreats it you will say
nothing to a living soul about the matter say till Friday What
stepbystep creatures we are to be sure I say Friday because it
will be exactly a week then And whats a weekto Nature scarcely
the unfolding of a rose But still Friday be it Then if nothing has
occurred we will we shall HAVE to call a friendly gathering we shall
be compelled to have a friendly consultation

Im not I hope a brute Bethany said Danton apologetically but
honestly speaking for myself simply as a man of the world its a
big risk to be taking onwhat shall we call iton mere intuition
Personally and even in a court of lawthough Heaven forbid it ever
reaches that stagepersonally I could swear that the fellow that stood
abusing me there in that revolting fashion was not Lawford It would
be easier even to believe in him if there were not thatthat glaze
that shocking simulation of the man himself the very man But then I
am a sceptic I own it And pon my word Mrs Lawford theres plenty of
room for sceptics in a world like this

Very well said Mr Bethany crisply thats settled then With your
permission my dear he added turning untarnishably clear childlike
eyes on Sheila I will take all riskseven to the foot of the gibbet
accessory Danton AFTER the fact And so direct and cloudless was his
gaze that Sheila tried in vain to evade it and to catch a glimpse
of Dantons small agatelike eyes now completely under mastery and
awaiting confidently the meeting with her own

Of course she said I am entirely in your hands dear Mr Bethany



CHAPTER ELEVEN

Lawford slept far into the cloudy Monday morning to wake steeped in
sleep lethargic and fretfully haunted by inconclusive remembrances
of the night before When Sheila with obvious and capacious composure
brought him his breakfast tray he watched her face for some time
without speaking

Sheila he began as she was about to leave the room again

She paused smiling

Did anything happen last night Would you mind telling me Sheila Who
was it was here

Her lids the least bit narrowed Certainly Arthur Mr Danton was
here

Then it was not a dream

Oh no said Sheila

What did I say What did HE say It was hopeless anyhow

I dont quite understand what you mean by hopeless Arthur And must
I answer the other questions

Lawford drew his hand over his face like a tired child He
didntbelieve

No dear said Sheila softly

And you Sheila came the subdued voice

Sheila crossed slowly to the window Well quite honestly Arthur I
was not very much surprised Whatever we are agreed about on the whole
you were scarcely yourself last night

Lawford shut his eyes and reopened them full on his wifes calm
scrutiny who had in that moment turned in the light of the one drawn
blind to face him again

Who is Always

No said Sheila butit was at least unfortunate We cant I
suppose rely on Dr Bethany alone

Lawford crouched over his food Will he blab

Blab Mr Danton is a gentleman Arthur

Lawford rolled his eyes as if in temporary vertigo Yes he said And
Sheila once more prepared to make a reposeful exit

I dont think I can see Simon this morning

Oh Who then

I mean I would prefer to be left alone

Believe me I had no intention to intrude And this time the door
really closed

He is in a quiet soothing sleep said Sheila a few minutes later

Nothing could be better said Dr Simon and Lawford to his
inexpressible relief heard the fevered throbbing of the doctors car
reverse and turned over and shut his eyes dulled and exhausted in
the still unfriendliness of the vacant room His spirits had sunk
he thought to their lowest ebb He scarcely heeded the fragments of
dreamsclear green landscapes amazing gleams of peace the
sudden broken voices the rustling and calling shadowiness of
subconsciousnessin this quiet sunlight of reality The clouds had
broken or had been withdrawn like a veil from the October skies One
thought alone was his refuge one face alone haunted him with its
peace one remembrance soothed himAlice Through all his scattered
and purposeless arguments he strove to remember her voice the
lovingkindness of her eyes her untroubled confidence

In the afternoon he got up and dressed himself He could not bring
himself to stand before the glass and deliberately shave He even smiled
at the thought of playing the barber to that lean chin He dressed by
the fireplace

I couldnt rest he told Sheila when she presently came in on one
of her quiet cautious heedful visits and one tires of reading even
Quain in bed

Have you found anything she inquired politely

Oh yes said Lawford wearily I have discovered that infinitely
worse things are infinitely commoner But that theres nothing quite so
picturesque

Tell me said Sheila with refreshing naivete How does it feel does
it even in the slightest degree affect your mind

He turned his back and looked up at his broad gilt portrait for
inspiration Practically not at all he said hollowly Of course
ones nervesthat fellow Dantonwhen ones overtired You havehis
voice in spite of every effort faintly quaveredYOU havent noticed
anything My mind

Me Oh dear no I never was the least bit observant you know
that Arthur But apart from that and I hope you will not think me
unsympatheticbut dont you think we must sooner or later be thinking
of whats to be done At present though I fully agree with Mr Bethany
as to the wisdom of hushing this unhappy business up as long as
possible at least from the gossiping outside world still we are only
standing still And your malady dear I suppose isnt You WILL help
me Arthur You will try and think Poor Alice

What about Alice

She mopes dear rather She cannot of course quite understand why
she must not see her father and yet his not being or for the matter
of that even if he was at deaths door

At deaths door murmured Lawford under his breath who was it
was saying that Have you ever Sheila in a dream or just as ones
thoughts go sometimes seen that doorits ruinous stone lintel carved
into lichenous stone headsstonily silent in the last thin sunlight
hanging in peace unlatched Heated hunted in agonyin that cold
greenclad shadowed porch is haven and sanctuaryBut beyondO God
beyond

Sheila stood listening with startled eyes And was all that in Quain
she inquired rather flutteringly

Lawford turned a sidelong head and looked steadily at his wife

She shook herself with a slight shiver Very well then she said and
paused in the silence

Her husband yawned and smiled and almost as if lit with that thin last
sunshine seemed the smile that passed for an instant across the reverie
of his shadowy face He drew a hand wearily over his eyes What has he
been saying now he inquired like a fretful child

Sheila stood very quiet and still as if in fear of scaring some rare
wild timid creature by the least stir Who she merely breathed

Lawford paused on the hearthrug with his comb in his hand Its just
the last rags of that beastly influenza he said and began vigorously
combing his hair And yet simple and frank though the action was it
moved Sheila perhaps more than any other of the congested occurrences
of the last few days Her forehead grew suddenly cold the palms of
her hands began to ache she had to hasten out of the room to avoid
revealing the sheer physical repulsion she had experienced

But Lawford quite unmindful of the shock continued in a kind of
heedless reverie to watch as he combed the still visionary thoughts
that passed in tranced stillness before his eyes He longed beyond
measure for freedom that until yesterday he had not even dreamed existed
outside the covers of some old impossible romancethe magic of the
darkening sky the invisible flocking presences of the dead the shock
of imaginations that had no words of quixotic emotions which the
stranger had stirred in that low mocking furtive talk beside the
broken stones of the Huguenot Was the change quite so monstrous so
meaningless How often indeed he remembered curiously had he seemed to
be standing outside these fastshut gates of thought that now had been
freely opened to him

He drew ajar the door and leant his ear to listen From far away came
a rich longcontinued chuckle of laughter followed by the clatter of a
falling plate and then still more uncontrollable laughter There was a
faint smell of toast on the air Lawford ventured out on to the landing
and into a little room that had once in years gone by been Alices
nursery He stood far back from the strip of open window that showed
beneath the green blind craning forward to see into the gardenthe
trees their knotted trunks and then as he stole nearer a flowerbed
late roses geraniums calceolarias the lawn andyes three wicker
chairs a footstool a workbasket a little table on the smooth grass
in the honeycoloured sunshine and Sheila sitting there in the autumnal
sunlight her hands resting on the arms of her chair her head bent
evidently deeply engrossed in her thoughts He crept an inch or two
forward and stooped There was a hat on the grassAlices big garden
hatand beside it lay Flitters nose on paws long ears sagging He
had forgotten Flitters Had Flitters forgotten him Would he bark at the
strange distasteful scent of aDr Ferguson The coast was clear then
He turned even softlier yet to confront rapt still and hovering
betwixt astonishment and dread the blue calm eyes of his daughter
looking in at the door It seemed to Lawford as if they had both been
suddenly swept by some unseen power into a still unearthly silence

We thought he began at last we thought just to beckon Mrs Lawford
from the window Hehe is asleep

Alice nodded Her whole face was in a moment flooded with red It ebbed
and left her pale I will go down and tell mother you want to see her
It was very silly of me I did not quite recognise at firstI suppose
thinking of my father The words faltered and the eyes were lifted to
his face again with a desolate incredulous appeal Lawford turned away
heartsick and trembling

Certainly certainly by no means he began listening vaguely to the
glib patter that seemed to come from another mouth Your father
my dear young lady I venture to think is now really on the road to
recovery Dr Simon makes excellent progress But of coursetwo heads
we know are so much better than one when theres the leastthe least
difficulty The great thing is quiet rest isolation no possibility of
a shock else His voice fell away his eloquence failed

For Alice stood gazing stirlessly on and on into this infinitely
strange infinitely familiar shadowy phantasmal face Oh yes she
replied I quite understand of course but if I might just peep even
it wouldI should be so much much happier Do let me just see him
Dr Ferguson if only his head on the pillow I wouldnt even breathe
Couldnt it possibly helpeven a faithcure She leant forward
impulsively her voice trembling anal her eyes still shining beneath
their faint melancholy smile

I fear my dearit cannot be He longs to see you But with his mind
you know in this state it might

But mother never told me broke in the girl desperately there was
anything wrong with his MIND Oh but that was quite unfair You dont
mean you dont meanthat

Lawford scanned swiftly the little square beloved and memoried room that
fate had suddenly converted for him into a cage of unspeakable pain
and longing Oh no believe me no Not his brain not that not even
wandering really but always thinking always longing on and on for
you dear only Quite quite master of himself but

You talk she broke in again angrily only in pretence You are
treating me like a child and so does mother and so it has been ever
since I came home Why if mother can and you can why may not I Why
if he can walk and talk in the night

But whowho can walk and talk in the night inquired a low stealthy
voice out of the quietness behind her

Alice turned swiftly Her mother was standing at a little distance with
all the calm and moveless concentration of a waxwork figure looking up
at her from the staircase

I wasI was talking to Dr Ferguson mother

But as I came up the stairs I understood you to be inquiring something
of Dr Ferguson if you were saying he can walk and talk in the
night you surely were not referring to your father child That could
not possibly be in his state Dr Ferguson I know will bear me out
in that at least And besides I really must insist on following out
medical directions to the letter Dr Ferguson I know will fully concur
Do pray Dr Ferguson continued Sheila raising her voice even now
scarcely above a rapid murmurdo pray assure my daughter that she must
have patience that however much even he himself may desire it it is
impossible that she should see her father yet And now my dear child
come down I want to have a moments talk with Dr Ferguson I feared
from his beckoning at the window that something was amiss

Alice turned dismayed and looked steadily almost with hostility
at the stranger so curiously transfixed and isolated in her small old
playroom And in this scornful yet pleading confrontation her eye fell
suddenly on the pin in his scarfthe claw and the pearl she had known
all her life From that her gaze flitted like some wild demented
things over face hair hands clothes attitude expression and her
heart stood still in an awful inarticulate dread of the unknown She
turned slowly towards her mother groped forward a few steps turned
once more stretching out her hands towards the vague still figure
whose eyes had called so piteously to her out of their depths and fell
fainting in the doorway Lawford stood motionless vacantly watching
Sheila who knelt chafing the cold hands She has fainted he said
oh Sheila tell meonly fainted

Sheila made no answer did not even raise her eyes

Some day Sheila he began in a dull voice and broke off and without
another word without even another glance at the still face and blue
twitching lids he passed her rapidly by and in another instant Sheila
heard the housedoor shut She got up quickly and after a glance into
the vacant bedroom turned the key then she hastened upstairs for sal
volatile and eau de cologne

It was yet clear daylight when Lawford appeared beneath the portico of
his house With a glance of circumspection that almost seemed to suggest
a fear of pursuit he descended the steps only to be made aware in so
doing that Ada was with a kind of furtive eagerness pointing out the
mysterious Dr Ferguson to a steadily gazing cook One or two wellknown
and many a wellremembered face he encountered in the thin stream of
City men treading blackly along the pavement It was a still high
evening and something very like a forlorn compassion rose in his mind
at sight of their grave rather pretentious rather dull respectable
faces

He found himself walking with an affectation of effrontery and smiling
with a faint contempt on all alike as if to keep himself from slinking
and the wolf out of his eyes He felt restless and watchful and
suspicious as if he had suddenly come down in the world His then was
a disguise as effectual as a shabby coat and a glazing eye His
heart sickened Was it even worth while living on a crust of social
respectability so thin and so exquisitely treacherous He challenged
no one One or two actual acquaintances raised and lowered a faintly
inquiring eyebrow in his direction One even recalled in his confusion
a smile of recognition just a moment too late There was it seemed
a peculiar aura in Lawfords presence a shadow of a something in his
demeanour that proved him alien

None the less green Widderstone kept calling him much as a bell in the
imagination tolls on and on the echo of reality If the worst should
come to the worst whythere is pasture in the solitary byways for
the beast that strays He quickened his pace along lonelier streets
and soon strode freely through the little flagged and cobbled village of
shops past the same small jutting window whose clock had told him the
hour on that first dark hurried night All was pale and faint with dying
colours now and decay was in the leaf and the last swallows filled
the gold air with their clashing stillness No one heeded him here He
looked from side to side exulting in the strangeness Shops were
left behind the last milestone passed and in a little while he was
descending the hill beneath the elm boughs which he remembered had
stood like a turreted wall against the sunset when first he had wandered
down into the churchyard

At the foot of the hill he passed by the green and white Rectory and
there was the parson a short fat pursy man with wrists protruding from
his jacket sleeves as he stood on tiptoe tying up a rambling roseshoot
on his trim cedared lawn The next house barely showed its old red
chimneytops above its bowers the next was empty with windows
vacantly gazing its paths peopled with great bearded weeds that stood
mutely watching and guarding the seldomopened gate Then came more
lofty grandmotherly elms a dense hedge of every leaf that pricks and
then Lawford found himself standing at the small canopied gate of
the queer old wooden house that the stranger of his talk had in part
described

It stood square and high and dark in a small amphitheatre of verdure
Roses here and there sprang from the grass and a narrow boxedged path
led to a small door in a low greenmantled wing with its one square
window above the porch And while with vacant mind Lawford stood
waiting as one stands forebodingly upon the eve of a new experience he
heard as if at a distance the sound of falling water He still paused on
the country roadside scrutinising this strange still wooden presence
but at last with an effort he pushed open the gate followed the winding
path and pulled the old iron hanging bell There came presently a
quiet tread and Herbert himself opened the door which led into a
little square woodpanelled hall hung with queer old prints and obscure
portraits in dark frames

Ah yes come in Mr Lawford he drawled I was beginning to be
afraid you were not coming

Lawford laid hat and walkingstick on an oak bench and followed his
churchyard companion up a slightly inclined corridor and a staircase
into a high room covered far up the yellowish walls with old books on
shelves and in cases between which hung in little black frames mezzo
tints etchings and antiquated maps A large table stood a few paces
from the deep alcove of the window which was surrounded by a low
faded green seat and was screened from the sunshine by wooden
shutters And here the tranquil surge of falling water shook incessantly
on the air for the three lower casements stood open to the fading
sunset On a smaller table were spread cups old earthenware dishes of
fruit and a big bowl of damask roses

Please sit down I shant be a moment I am not sure that my sister is
in but if so I will tell her we are ready for tea Left to himself
in this quiet strange old room Lawford forgot for a while everything
else he was for the moment so taken up with his surroundings

What seized on his fancy and strangely affected his mind was this
incessant changing roar of falling water It must be the Widder he said
to himself flowing close to the walls But not until he had had the
boldness to lean head and shoulders out of the nearest window did he
fully realize how close indeed the Widder was It came sweeping dark
and deep and begreened and full with the early autumnal rains actually
against the lower walls of the house itself and in the middle suddenly
swerved in a black smooth arch and tumbled headlong into a great
pool nodding with tall slender waterweeds and charged in its bubbled
blackness here and there with the last crimson of the setting sun To
the left of the house where the waters floated free again stood vast
still trees above the clustering rushes and in glimpses between their
spreading boughs lay the farstretching countryside now dimmed with the
first mists of approaching evening So absorbed he became as he stood
leaning over the wooden sill above the falling water that eye and ear
became enslaved by the roar and stillness And in the faint atmosphere
of age that seemed like a veil to hang about the odd old house and these
prodigious branches he fell into a kind of waking dream

When at last he did draw back into the room it was perceptibly darker
and a thin keen shaft of recollection struck across his mindthe
recollection of what he was and of how he came to be there his reasons
for coming and of that dark indefinable presence which like a raven had
begun to build its dwelling in his mind He sat on his eyes restlessly
wandering his face leaning on his hands and in a while the door opened
and Herbert returned carrying an old crimson and green teapot and a
dish of hot cakes

Theyre all out he said sister Sallie and boy but these were in
the oven so we wont wait I hope you havent been very much bored

Lawford dropped his hands from his face and smiled I have been looking
at the water he said

My sisters favorite occupation she sits for hours and hours with not
even a book for an apology staring down into the black old roaring pot
It has a sort of hypnotic effect after a time And youd be surprised
how quickly one gets used to the noise To me its even less distracting
than sheer silence You dont know after all what on earth sheer
silence meanseven at Widderstone But one can just realize a
waternymph They chatter but thank Heaven its not articulate He
handed Lawford a cup with a certain niceness and selfconsciousness
lifting his eyebrows slightly as he turned

Lawford found himself listening out of a peculiar stillness of mind
to the voice of this suave and rather inscrutable acquaintance The
curious thing is do you know he began rather nervously that though
I must have passed your gate at least twice in the last few months I
have never noticed it before never even caught the sound of the water

No thats the best of it nobody ever does We are just buried alive
We have lived here for years and scarcely know a soulnot even our
own perhaps Why on earth should one Acquaintances after all are
little else than a bad habit

But then what about me said Lawford

But thats just it said Herbert I said ACQUAINTANCES thats just
exactly what Im going to provewhat very old friends we are Youve no
idea It really is rather queer He took up his cup and sauntered over
to the window

Lawford eyed him vacantly for a moment and following rather his
own curious thoughts than seeking any light on this somewhat vague
explanation again broke the silence Its odd I suppose but this
house affects me much in the same way as Widderstone does Im not
particularly fancifulat least I used not to be But sitting here I
seem I hope it isnt a very frantic remark it seems as though if only
my ears would let me I should hearwell voices Its just what you
said about the silence I suppose its the age of the place it IS very
old

Pretty old I suppose its wormeaten and rateaten and tindery enough
in all conscience and the damp doesnt exactly foster it Its a queer
old shanty There are two or three accounts of it in some old local
stuff I have And of course theres a ghost

A ghost echoed Lawford looking up



CHAPTER TWELVE

Whats in a name laughed Herbert But it really is a queer showup of
human oddity A fellow comes in here searching thats all His back
was turned as he stood staring absently out sipping his tea between
his sentences He comes inoh its a positive fact for Ive seen him
myself just sitting back in my chair here you know watching him as
one would a tramp in ones orchard He cast a candid glance over his
shoulder First he looks round like a prying servant Then he comes
cautiously ona kind of grizzled fawncoloured face middlesize with
big hands and then just like some quiet groping nocturnal creature
he begins his precious searchshelves drawers that are not here
cupboards gone years ago questing and nosing no end and quite
methodically too until he reaches the window Then he stops looks
back narrows his foxy lids listensquite perceptibly you know a
kind of gingerish blur then he seems to open this corner bookcase here
as if it were a door and goes out along what I suppose might at some
time have been an outside gallery or balcony unless as I rather fancy
the house extended once beyond these windows Anyhow out he goes quite
deliberately treading the air as lightly as Botticellis angels
until however far you lean out of the window you cant follow him any
further And thenand this is the bit that takes ones fancywhen you
have contentedly noddled down again to whatever you may have been doing
when the wretch appeared or are sitting in a cold sweat with bolting
eyes awaiting developments just according to your school of thought
or of nerves the creature comes backcomes back and with what looks
uncommonly like a lighted candle in his hand That really is a thrill I
assure you

But youve seen thisyouve really seen this yourself

Oh yes twice replied Herbert cheerfully And my sister quite
by haphazard once saw him from the garden She was shelling peas one
evening for Sallie and she distinctly saw him shamble out of the window
here and go shuffling along midair across the roaring washpot down
below turn sharp round the high corner of the house sheer against
the stars in a kind of frightened hurry And then after five minutes
concentrated watching over the shucks she saw him come shuffling back
againthe same distraction the same nebulous snuff colour and a
candle trailing its smoke behind him as he whisked in home

And then

Ah then said Herbert lagging along the bookshelves and scanning
the bookbacks with eyes partially closed he turned with lifted teapot
and refilled his visitors cup then wherever you areI mean he
added cutting up a little cake into six neat slices wherever the
chance inmate of the room happens to be he comes straight for you at
a quite alarming velocity and fades vanishes melts or as it were
silts inside

Lawford listened in a curious hush that had suddenly fallen over his
mind Fades inside siltsIm awfully stupid but what on earth
do you mean The room had slowly emptied itself of daylight its own
darkness it seemed had met that of the narrowing night and Herbert
deliberately lit a cigarette before replying His clear pale face with
its smooth outline and thin mouth and rather long dark eyes turned with
a kind of serene goodhumour towards his questioner

Why he said I mean frankly just that Besides its Grisels own
phrase and an old nurse we used to have said much the same He comes
or IT comes towards you first just walking then with a kind of
gradually accelerated slide or glide and sweeps straight into you he
tapped his chest me whoever it may be is here In a kind of panic I
suppose to hide or perhaps simply to get back again

Get back where

Be resumed as it were via you You see I suppose he is compelled to
regain his circle or Purgatory or Styx whatever you like to call it
via consciousness No one present then no revenant or spook or
astral body or hallucination whats in a name And of course even an
hallucination is mindstuff and on its own as it were What I mean is
that the poor devil must have some kind of human personality to get back
through in order to make his exit from our sphere of consciousness
into his And naturally of course to make his entrance too If like
a tenuous smoke he can get in the probability is that he gets out
in precisely the same fashion For really if you werent consciously
expecting the customary impact you actually jerk forward in the act of
resistance unresisted you would not notice his going I am afraid I
must be horribly boring you with all these tangled theories All I mean
is that if you were really absorbed in what you happened to be doing at
the time the thing might come and go with your mind for entrance and
exit as it were without your being conscious of it at all There was
a longish pause in which Herbert slowly inhaled and softly breathed out
his smoke

And whatwhat is the poor wretch searching FOR And whatwhy what
becomes of him when he does go

Ah there you have me One merely surmises just as ones temperament or
convictions lean Grisel says its some poor derelict soul in search of
peacethat the poor beggar wants finally to die in fact and cant
Sallie smells crime After all what is every man he talked on a
horde of ghostslike a Chinese nest of boxesoaks that were acorns
that were oaks Death lies behind us not in frontin our ancestors
back and back until

Until Lawford managed to remark

Ah that settles me again Dont they call it an amoeba But really I
am abjectly ignorant of all that kind of stuff We are ALL we are and
all in a sense we care to dream we are And for that matter anything
outlandish bizarre is a godsend in this rather stodgy life It is
after all just what the old boy saidits only the impossible thats
credible whatever credible may mean

It seemed to Lawford as if the last remark had wafted him bodily into
the presence of his kind blinking intensely anxious old friend Mr
Bethany And what leagues asunder the two men were who had happened on
much the same words to express their convictions

He drew his hand gropingly over his face half rose and again seated
himself Whatever it may be he said the whole thing reminds me you
knowit is in a way so curiously like my ownmy own case

Herbert sat on a little drawn up in his chair quietly smoking The
crash of the falling water after seeming to increase in volume with
the fading of evening had again died down in the darkness to a low
multitudinous tumult as of countless inarticulate echoing voices

Bizarre you said God knows I am But Herbert still remained
obdurately silent You remember perhaps Lawford faintly began again
our talk the other night

Oh rather replied the cordial voice out of the dusk

I suppose you thought I was insane

Insane There was a genuinely amused astonishment in the echo You
were lucidity itself Besideswell honestly if I may venture I dont
put very much truck in what one calls ones sanity except of course
as a bond of respectability and a means of livelihood

But did you realise in the least from what I said how I really
stand That I went down into that old shadowy hollow one man and came
backwellthis

I gathered vaguely something like that I thought at first it was
merely an affectationthat what you said was an affectation I
meanuntilwell to be frank it was the this that so immensely
interested me Especially he added almost with a touch of gaiety
especially the last glimpse But if its really not a forbidden
question what precisely was the other What precise manner of man I
mean came down into Widderstone

It is my face that is changed Mr Herbert If youll try to understand
memy FACE What you see now is not what I really am not what I was
Oh it is all quite different I know perfectly well how absurd it must
sound And you wont press me further But thats the truth thats what
they have done for me

It seemed to Lawford as if a remote tiny shout of laughter had been
suddenly caught back in the silence that had followed this confession
He peered in vain in the direction of his companion Even his cigarette
revealed no sign of him I know I know he went gropingly on I felt
it would sound to you like nothing but frantic incredible nonsense YOU
cant see it YOU cant feel it YOU cant hear these hooting voices
Its no use at all blinking the fact I am simply on the verge if not
over it of insanity

As to that Mr Lawford came the still voice out of the darkness
the very fact of your being able to say so seems to me all but proof
positive that youre not Insanity is on another plane isnt it
in which one cant compare ones states As for what you say being
credible take our precious noodle of a spook here Ninetynine
hundredths of this amiable world of ours would have guffawed the
poor creature into imperceptibility ages ago To such poor credulous
creatures as my sister and I he is no more and no less a fact a
personality an amusing reality thanwell this teacup Here we are
amazing mysteries both of us in any case and all round us are scores
of books dealing just with life pure candid and unexpurgated and
theres not a single one among them but reads like a taradiddle Yet
grope between the lines of any autobiography its pretty clear what
one has gota feeble timid creeping attempt to describe the
indescribable As for what you say your case is the bizarrethat kind
very seldom gets into print at all In all our makebelieve all our
pretence how honestly could it But there this is immaterial The
real question is may I can I help What I gather is this You just
trundled down into Widderstone all among the dead men andbut one
moment Ill light up

A light flickered up in the dark Shading it in his hand from the night
air straying through the open window Herbert lit the two candles
that stood upon the little chimneypiece behind Lawfords head Then
sauntering over to the window again almost as if with an affectation
of nonchalance he drew one of the shutters and sat down Nothing much
struck me he went on leaning back on his hands I mean on Sunday
evening until you said goodbye It was then that I caught in the moon
a distinct glimpse of your face

This said Lawford with a sudden horrible sinking of the heart

Herbert nodded The fact is I have a print of it he said

A print of it

A miserable little dingy engraving

Of this Herbert nodded with eyes fixed Where

Thats the nuisance I searched high and low for it the instant I got
home For the moment it has been mislaid but it must be somewhere in
the house and it will turn up all in good time Its the frontispiece
of one of a queer old hotchpotch of pamphlets sewn up together by
some amateur enthusiast in a marbled paper coverconfessions travels
trials and so on All eighteenth century and all in French

And mine said Lawford gazing stonily across the candlelight

Herbert from a head slightly stooping gazed back in an almost birdlike
fashion across the room at his visitor

Sabathiers he said

Sabathiers

A really curious resemblance Of course I am speaking only from
memory and perhaps its not quite so vivid in this light but still
astonishingly clear

Lawford sat drawn up staring at his companions face in an intense and
helpless silence His mouth opened but no words came

Of course began Herbert again I dont say theres anything in
itexcept thethe mere coincidence he paused and glanced out of the
open casement beside him But theres just one obvious question Do you
happen to know of any strain of French blood in your family

Lawford shut his eyes even memory seemed to be forsaking him at last
No he said after a long pause theres a little Dutch I think on
my mothers side but no French

No Sabathier then said Herbert smiling And then theres another
questionthis change is it really as complete as you suppose Has
itplease just warn me off if I am in the least intrudinghas it been
noticed

Lawford hesitated Oh yes he said slowly it has been noticedmy
wife a few friends

Do you mind this infernal clatter said Herbert laying his fingers on
the open casement

No no And you think

My dear fellow I dont think anything Its all the craziest
conjecture Stranger things even than this have happened There are
dozens herein print What are we human beings after all Clay in the
hands of the potter Our bodies are merely an inheritance packed tight
and corded up We have practically no control over their main functions
We cant even replace a little fingernail And look at the faces of
uswhat atrocious mockeries most of them are of any kind of image But
we know our bodies changeage sickness thought passion fatality It
proves they are amazingly plastic And merely even as a theory it is not
in the least untenable that by force of some violent convulsive effort
from outside ones body might change It answers with odd voluntariness
to friend or foe smile or snarl As for what we call the laws of
Nature they are pure assumptions today and may be nothing better
than scrapiron tomorrow Good Heavens Lawford consider mans abysmal
impudence He smoked on in silence for a moment You say you fell
asleep down there

Lawford nodded Herbert tapped his cigarette on the sill Just
following up our ludicrous conjecture you know he remarked musingly
it wasnt such a bad opportunity for the poor chap

But surely said Lawford speaking as it were out of a dream of
candlelight and reverberating sound and clearest darkness towards
this strange deliberate phantom with the unruffled clearcut
featuressurely then in that case he is here now And yet on my
word of honour though every friend I ever had in the world should
deny it I am the same Memory stretches back clear and sound to my
childhood I can see myself with extraordinary lucidity how I think my
motives and all that and in spite of these voices that I seem to hear
and this peculiar kind of longing to break away as it were just
to press onit is II myself that am speaking to you now out of
thisthis mask

Herbert glanced reflectively at his companion You mustnt let me tire
you he said but even on our theory it would not necessarily
follow that you yourself would be much affected Its true this fellow
Sabathier really was something of a personality He had a rather
unusual itch for life for trying on and on to squeeze something out
of experience that isnt there and he seemed never to weary of a
magnificent attempt to find in his fellowcreatures especially in the
women he met what evenif they have itthey cannot give The little
book I wanted to show you is partly autobiographical and really does
manage to set the fellow on his feet Even there he does absolutely take
ones imagination I shall never forget the thrill of picking him up in
the Charing Cross Road You see I had known the queer old tombstone for
years Hes enormously vividquite beyond my feebleness to describe
with a kind of French verve and rapture Unluckily we cant get nearer
than two years to his death I shouldnt mind guessing some last
devastating dream swept over him held him the breath of an instant too
long beneath the wave and he caved in We know he killed himself and
perhaps lived to regret it ever after

After all what is this precious dying we talk so much about Herbert
continued after a while his eyes restlessly wandering from shelf to
shelf You remember our talk in the churchyard We all know that the
body fades quick enough when its occupant is gone Supposing even in the
sleep of the living it lies very feebly guarded And supposing in that
state some infernally potent thing outside it wandering disembodied
just happens on itlike some hungry sexton beetle on the carcase of
a mouse SupposingI know its the most outrageous theorisingbut
supposing all these years of sun and dark Sabathiers emanation
or whatever you like to call it horribly restless by some fatality
longing on and on just for life or even for the face the voice of
some impossible she whom he couldnt get in this muddled world simply
loathing all else supposing he has been lingering in ambush down beside
those poor old dusty bones that had poured out for him such marrowy
hospitalityoh I know it the dead do And then by a chance one
quiet autumn evening a veritable godsend of a little Miss Muffet comes
wandering down under the shade of his immortal cypresses half asleep
fagged out depressed in mind and body perhaps imagine yourself in his
place and he in yours Herbert stood up in his eagerness his sleek
hair shining The one clinching chance of a century Wouldnt you
have made a fight for it Wouldnt you have risked the raid I can just
conceive itthe amazing struggle in that darkness within a darkness
like some dazed alien bee bursting through the sentinels of a hive
one mad impetuous clutch at victory then the appalling stirring on the
other side the groping back to a house dismantled rearranged not
mind you disorganised or disintegrated He broke off with a smile
as if of apology for his long fantastic harangue

Lawford sat listening his eyes fixed on Herberts colourless face
There was not a sound else it seemed than that slightly drawling
scrupulous voice poking its way amid a maze of enticing baffling
thoughts Herbert turned away with a shrug Its tempting stuff he
said choosing another cigarette But anyhow the poor beggar failed

Failed

Why surely if he had succeeded I should not now be talking to a mere
imperfect simulacrum to the outward illusion of a passing likeness
to the man but to Sabathier himself His eyes moved slowly round and
dwelt for a moment with a dark quiet scrutiny on his visitor

You say a passing likeness do you MEAN that

Herbert smiled indulgently If one CAN mean what is purely a
speculation I am only trying to look at the thing dispassionately you
see We are so much the slaves of mere repetition Here is lifeyours
and minea kind of plenum in vacuo It is only when we begin to play
the eavesdropper when something goes askew when one of the sentries on
the frontier of the unexpected shouts a hoarse Qui viveit is only
then we begin to question to prick our aldermen and pinch the calves
of our kings Why who is there can answer to anybodys but his own
satisfaction just that one fundamental questionAre we the prisoners
the slaves the inheritors the creatures or the creators of our
bodies Fallen angels or horrific dust As for identity or likeness
or personality we have only our neighbours nod for them and just a
fading memory No the old fairy tales knew better and witchcrafts
witchcraft to the end of the chapter Honestly and just of course on
that one theory Lawford I cant help thinking that Sabathiers raid
only just so far succeeded as to leave his impression in the wax
It doesnt of course follow that it will necessarily end there It
mightit may be even now just gradually fading away It may you know
need driving outwith whips and scorpions It might perhaps work in

Lawford sat cold and still Its no good no good he said I dont
understand I cant follow you I was always stupid always bigoted and
cocksure These things have never seemed anything but old womens tales
to me And now I must pay for it And this Nicholas Sabathier you say
he was a blackguard

Well said Herbert with a faint smile that depends on your
definition of the word He wasnt a flunkey a fool or a prig if
thats what you mean He wasnt perhaps on Mrs Grundys visiting
list He wasnt exactly gregarious And yet in a sense that kind of
temperament is so rare that Sappho Nelson and Shelley shared it To
the stodgy suety world of course its little else than sheer moonshine
midsummer madness Naturally in its own charming and stodgy way
the world kept flickering cold water in his direction Naturally it
hissed I shall find the book You shall have the book oh yes

Theres only one more question said Lawford in a dull slow voice
stooping and covering his face with his hands I know its impossible
for you to realisebut to me time seems like that water there to be
heaping up about me I wait just as one waits when the conductor of an
orchestra lifts his hand and in a moment the whole surge of brass and
wood cymbal and drum will crash outand sweep me under I cant tell
you Herbert how it all is with just these groping stirrings of that
mole in my minds dark You say it may be this face working in God
knows I find it easy to speak to youthis cold clear sense you know
The others feel too much or are afraid orLet me thinkyes I
was going to ask you a question But no one can answer it He peered
darkly with white face suddenly revealed between his hands What
remains now Where do I come in What is there left for ME to do

And at that moment there sounded even above the monotonous roar of
the water beyond the windowthere fell the sound of a light footfall
approaching along the corridor

Listen said Herbert heres my sister coming well ask her




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

The door opened Lawford rose and into the further rays of the
candlelight entered a rather slim figure in a light summer gown

Just home said Herbert

Weve been for a walk

My sister always forgets everything said Herbert turning to Lawford
even teatime This is Mr Lawford Grisel Weve been arguing no end
And we want you to give a decision Its just this Supposing if by some
impossible trick you had come in now not the charming familiar sister
you are but shorter fatter fair and roundfaced quite different
physically you knowwhat would you do

What nonsense you talk Herbert

Yes but supposing a complete transmogrificationby some unimaginable
ingression or enchantment by nibbling a bunch of roses or whatever you
like to call it

Only physically

Well yes actually but potentially whythats another matter

The dark eyes passed slowly from her brothers face and rested gravely
on their visitors

Is he making fun of me

Lawford almost imperceptibly shook his head

But what a question And Ive had no tea She drew her gloves slowly
through her hand The thing of course isnt possible I know But
shouldnt I go mad dont you think

Lawford gazed quietly back into the clear grave deliberate eyes
Suppose suppose just for the sake of argumentNOT he suggested

She turned her head and reflected glancing from one to the other of the
pure steady candleflames

And what was your answer she said looking over her shoulder at her
brother

My dear child you know what my answers are like

And yours

Lawford took a deep breath gazing mutely forlornly into the lovely
untroubled peace of her eyes and without the least warning tears swept
up into his own With an immense effort he turned and choking back
every sound beating hack every thought groped his way towards the
square black darkness of the open door

I must think I must think he managed to whisper lifting his hand
and steadying himself He caught over his shoulder the glimpse of a
curiously distorted vision a lifted candle and a still face gazing
after him with infinitely grieved eyes then found himself groping and
stumbling down the steep uneven staircase into the darkness of the
queer old wooden and hushed and lonely house The night air cold on his
face calmed his mind He turned and held out his hand

Youll come again Herbert was saying with a hint of anxiety even of
apology in his voice

Lawford nodded with eyes fixed blankly on the candle and turning once
more made his way slowly down the narrow greenbordered path upon which
the stars rained a scattered light so feeble it seemed but as a haze
that blurred the darkness He pushed open the little white wicket
and turned his face towards the soundless leafcrowned hill He had
advanced hardly a score of steps in the thick dust when almost as if
its very silence had struck upon his ear he remembered the black broken
grave with its sightless heads that lay beyond the leaves And fear
vast and menacing fear such as only children know broke like a sea of
darkness on his heart He stopped deadcold helpless trembling
And in the silence he heard a faint cry behind him and light footsteps
pursuing him He turned again In the thick close gloom beneath the
enormous elmboughs the grey eyes shone clearly visible in the face
upturned to him My brother she began breathlesslythe little
French book It was I whowho mislaid it

The set stricken face listened unmoved

You are ill Come back I am afraid you are very ill

Its not that not that Lawford muttered dont leave me I am
alone Dont question me he said strangely looking down into her
face clutching her hand only understand that I cant I cant go on
He swept a lean arm towards the unseen churchyard I am afraid

The cold hand clasped his closer Hush dont speak Come back come
back I am with you a friend you see come back

Lawford clutched her hand as a blind man in sudden peril might clutch
the hand of a child He saw nothing clearly spoke almost without
understanding his words

Oh but its MUST he said I MUST go on You seewhy everything
depends on struggling through the future But if you only knewThere
Again his arm swept out and the lean terrified face turned shuddering
from the dark

I do know believe me believe me I can guess See I am coming with
you we will go together As if as if I did not know what it is to be
afraid Oh believe me no one is near we go on and see it gradually
gradually lightens How thankful I am I came

She had turned and they were steadily ascending as if pushing their way
battling on through some obstacle of the mind rather than of the senses
beneath the starpowdered callous vault of night And it seemed to
Lawford as if as they pressed on together some obscure detestable
presence as slowly as doggedly had drawn worsted aside He could
see again the peaceful outspread branches of the trees the lychgate
standing in clearcut silhouette against the liquid dusk of the sky
A strange calm stole over his mind The very meaning and memory of his
fear faded out and vanished as the passedaway clouds of a storm that
leave a purer serener sky

They stopped and stood together on the brow of the little hill and
Lawford still trembling from head to foot looked back across the
hushed and lightless countryside Its all gone now he said
wearily and now theres nothing left You see I cannot even ask your
forgivenessand a stranger

Please dont say thatunlessunlessa pilgrim too I think
surely you must own we did have the best of it that time Yesand I
dont care WHO may be listeningbut we DID win through

What can I say How shall I explain How shall I make you understand

The clear grey eyes showed not the faintest perturbation But I do I
do indeed in part I do understand ever so faintly

And now I will come back with you

They paused in the darkness face to face the silence of the sky
arched in its vastness above the little hill the only witness of their
triumph

She turned unquestioningly And laughing softly almost as children
do the stalking shadows of a twilight wood behind themthey trod in
silence back to the house They said goodbye at the gate and Lawford
started once more for home He walked slowly conscious of an almost
intolerable weariness as if his strength had suddenly been wrested away
from him And at some distance beyond the top of the hill he sat down on
the bank beside a nettled ditch and with his book pressed down upon
the wayside grass struck a match and holding it low in the scented
windless air turned slowly the cockled leaf

Few of them were alike except for the dinginess of the print and the
sinister smudge of the portraits All were sewn roughly together into
a mouldstained marbled cover He lit a second match and as he did so
glanced as if inquiringly over his shoulder And a score or so of pages
before the end he came at last upon the name he was seeking and turned
the page

It was a likeness even more striking in its crudeness of ink and line
and paper than the most finished of portraits could have been It
repelled and yet it fascinated him He had not for a moment doubted
Herberts calm conviction And yet as he stooped in the grass closely
scrutinising the blurred obscure features he felt the faintest surprise
not so much at the significant resemblance but at his own composure his
own steady unflinching confrontation with this sinister and intangible
adversary The match burned down to his fingers It hissed faintly in
the grass

He stuffed the book into his pocket and stared into the pale dial of
his watch It was a few minutes after eleven Midnight then would
just see him in He rose stiffly and yawned in sheer exhaustion Then
hesitating he turned his head and looked back towards the hollow But
a vague foreboding held him back A sour and vacuous incredulity swept
over him What was the use of all this struggling and vexation What
gain in living on Once dead his sluggish spirit at least would find
its rest Dust to dust it would indeed be for him What else in sober
earnest had he been all his daily stolid life but half dead scarce
conscious without a living thought or desire in head or heart

And while he was still gloomily debating within himself he had turned
towards home and soon was walking in a kind of reverie even his
extreme tiredness in part forgotten and only a faraway dogged
recollection in his mind that in spite of shame in spite of all his
miserable weakness the words had been uttered once for all and in all
sincerity We DID win through

Yet a desolate and odd air of strangeness seemed to drape his unlighted
house as he stood looking up in a kind of furtive communion with its
windows It affected him with that discomforting air of extreme and
meaningless novelty that things very familiar sometimes take upon
themselves In this leaden tiredness no impression could be trustworthy
His lids shut of themselves as he softly mounted the steps It seemed a
needlessly wide door that soundlessly admitted him But however hard he
pressed the key his bedroom door remained stubbornly shut until he
found that it was already unlocked and he had only to turn the handle
A nightlight burned in a little basin on the washstand The room was
hung as it were with the stillness of night And half lying on the
bed in her dressinggown her head leaning on the rail at the foot was
Alice just as sleep had overtaken her

Lawford returned to the door and listened It seemed he heard a voice
talking downstairs and yet not talking for it ran on and on in an
incessant slightly argumentative monotony that had neither break nor
interruption He closed the door and stooping laid his hand softly on
Alices narrow still childish hand that lay halffolded on her knee
Her eyes opened instantly and gazed widely into his face A slow vacant
smile of sleep came and went and her fingers tightened gently over his
as again her lids drooped down over the drowsy blue eyes

At last at last dear she said I have been waiting such a time
But we mustnt talk much Mother is waiting up reading

Faintly through the closeshut door came the sound of that distant
expressionless voice monotonously rising and falling

Why didnt you tell me dear Alice still sleepily whispered Would
I have asked a single question How could I Oh if you had only trusted
me

But the changethe change Alice You must have seen that You spoke
to me you did think I was only a stranger and even when you knew it
was only fear on your face dearest and aversion and you turned to
your mother first Dont think Alice that I amGod only knowsIm
not complaining But truth is best whatever it is I do feel that You
mustnt be afraid of hurting me my dear

Her very hands seemed to quicken in his as now with sleep quite gone
the fret of memory returned and she must reassure both herself and him
But you see dear mother had told me that youbesides I did know
you at once really quite inside you know deep down I know I was
perplexed I didnt understand but that was all Why even when you
came up in the dark and we talkedif you only knew how miserable I had
beenthough I knew even then there was something different still I
was not a bit afraid Was I And shouldnt I have been afraid horribly
afraid if YOU had not been YOU She repressed a little shudder and
clasped his hand more closely Dont let us say anything more about it
she implored him we are just together again you and I that is all
that matters But her words were like brave soldiers who have fought
their way through an ambuscade but have left all confidence behind them

Lawford listened and that was enough just nowthat she still in spite
of doubt believed in him and thought and cared for him He was too
tired to have refused the least kindness He made no answer but leant
his head on the cool slender fingers in gratitude and peace And just
as he was he almost instantly fell asleep He woke in the darkness to
find himself alone He groped his way heavily to the door and turned
the handle But now it was really locked Energy failed him I
supposeSheila he muttered



CHAPTER FOURTEEN

Sheila calm alert reserved was sitting at the open window when he
awoke again His breakfast tray stood on a little table beside the bed
He raised himself on his elbow and looked at his wife The morning
light shone full on her features as she turned quickly at sound of his
stirring

You have slept late she said in a low mellow voice

Have I Sheila I suppose I was tired out It is very kind of you to
have got everything ready like this

I am afraid Arthur I was thinking rather of the maids I like to
inconvenience them as little as possible in their usual routine I
mean How are you feeling do you think this morning

II havent seen the glass Sheila

She paused to place a little pencil tick at the foot of the page of her
butchers book And did youdid you try

Did I try Try what

I understood she said turning slowly in her chair you gave me to
understand that you went out with the specific intention of trying to
regain But there forgive me Arthur I think I must be getting a
little bit hardened to the position so far at least as any hope is in
my mind of rather amateurish experiments being of much help I may seem
unsympathetic in saying frankly what I feel But amateurish or no you
are curiously erratic Why if you really were the Dr Ferguson whose
part you play so admirably you could scarcely spend a more active life

All you mean Sheila I suppose is that I have failed

Failed did not enter my mind I thought looking at you just now
in your clothes on the bed one might for the moment be deceived into
thinking there was a slightquite the slightest improvement There
was not quite thatshe hovered for the right wordthat tenseness
Whether or not whether you desired any such change or didnt I should
have supposed in any case it would have been better to act as far
as possible like any ordinary person You were certainly in an
extraordinarily sound sleep I was almost alarmed until I remembered
that it was a little after two when I looked up from reading aloud to
keep myself awake and discovered that you had only just come home I had
no fire You know how easily late hours bring on my headaches a little
thought might possibly have suggested that I should be anxious to hear
But no it seems I cannot profit by experience Arthur And even now you
have not answered surely a very natural question You do not recollect
perhaps exactly what did happen last night Did you go in the direction
even of Widderstone

Yes Sheila I went to Widderstone

It was of course absurd to suppose that sitting on a seat beside
the brokendown grave of a suicide would have the slightest effect on
onesones physical condition though possibly it might affect ones
brain It would mine I am at least certain of that It was your own
prescription however and it merely occurred to me to inquire whether
the actual experience has not brought you round to my own opinion

Yes I think it has Lawford answered calmly But I dont quite see
what suicide has got to do with it unlessYou know Widderstone then
Sheila

I drove there last Saturday afternoon

For prayer or praise Although Lawford had not actually raised his
head he became conscious rather of the wonderfully adjusted mass
of hair than of the pained dignity in the face that was now closely
regarding him

I went came the rigidly controlled retort simply to test an
inconceivable story

And returned

Convinced Arthur of its inconceivability But if you would kindly
inform me what precise formula you followed at Widderstone last night I
would tell you why I think the explanation or rather your first account
of the matter is not an explanation of the facts

Lawford shot a rather doglike glance over his toast Danton he said

Candidly Arthur Mr Danton doubts the whole story Your very
conductwell it would serve no useful purpose to go into that
Candidly on the other hand Mr Danton did make some extremely helpful
suggestionsbasing them of course on the TRUTH of your account He
has seen a good deal of life and certainly very mysterious things do
occur to quite innocent and wellmeaning people without the faintest
shadow of warning and as Mr Bethany himself said evil birds do come
home to roost and often out of a clear sky as it were But there
every fresh solution that occurs to me only makes the thing more
preposterous more I was going to say disreputableI mean of course
to the outside world And we have our duties to perform to them too I
suppose Why what can we say What plausible account of ourselves have
we We shall never be able to look anybody in the face again I can
onlyI am compelled to believe that God has been pleased to make this
precise visitation upon usan eye for an eye I suppose SOMEWHERE And
to that conviction I shall hold until actual circumstances convince me
that its false What however and this is all that I have to say now
what I cannot understand are your amazing indiscretions

Do you understand your own Sheila

My indiscretions Arthur

Well said Lawford wasnt it indiscreet dont you think to risk
divine retribution by marrying me Shouldnt you have inquired Wasnt
it indiscreet to allow me to remain here inin my visitation Wasnt
it indiscreet to risk the moral stigma this unhappy face of mine must
cast on its surroundings I am not sure whether such a change as this
constitutes cruelty Oh what is the use of fretting and babbling on
like this

Am I to understand then that you refuse positively to discuss this
horrible business any more You are doing your best to drive me away
Arthur you must see that Will you be very disappointed if I refuse to
go

Lawford rose from the bed Listen just this once he said seating
himself on the corner of the dressingtable Imagine all thiswhatever
you like to call itobliterated Take this he nodded towards the
glass entirely for itself on its own merits as it were Let the dead
past bury its dead Which now precisely REALLY do you preferhim
he jerked his head in the direction of the dispassionate youthful
picture on the wall him or me

He was so close to her now that he could see the faintest tremor on the
face that had suddenly become grey and still in the thin clear sunshine

I own it I own it he went on slowly the change is more than
skindeep now One cant go through what I have gone through these last
few terrifying days Sheila unchanged They have played the devil with
my body now begins the tampering with my mind Not even Danton knows
how it will end But shall I tell you why you wont why you cant
answer me that one questionhim or me Shall I tell you

Sheila slowly raised her eyes

It is because my dear you dont care the ghost of a straw for either
That onehe was worn out long ago and we never knew it I know it now
Time and the sheer goingon of day by day without either of us guessing
at it wore that down till it had no more meaning for you or me than any
other faded remembrance in this interminable footling with truth that we
call life And this onethe whole abject meaning of it lies simply in
the fact that it has pierced down and shown us up I had no courage
I couldnt see how feeble a hold I had on lifejust ones friends
opinions It was all at second hand What I want to know now isleave
me out dont think or care or regard my livingon one shadow of an
iotaall I ask is What am I to do for you He turned away and stood
staring down at the cinders in the fireless grate

I answer that mad wicked outburst with one plain question said a low
trembling voice did you or did you not go to Widderstone yesterday

I did go

You sat there just as you said you sat before and with all your heart
and soul strove to regainyourself

Lawford lifted a still colourless face into the sunlight No he
said I spent the evening at the house of a friend

Then I say it is infamous You cast all this on me You have brought
me into contempt and poisoned Alices whole life You dream and idle
on just as you used to do without the least care or thought or
consideration for others and go out in this conditiongo out
absolutely unashamedto spend the evening at a friends Peculiar
friends they must be Why really Arthur you must be mad

Lawford paused Like a flock of sheep streaming helterskelter before
the onset of a wolf were the thoughts that a moment before had seemed so
orderly and sober

Not madpossessed he said softly

And I add this cried Sheila as it were out of a tragic mask
somewhere in the past whether of your own life or of the lives of
those who brought you into the worldthe world which you pretend so
conveniently to despisesomewhere is hidden some miserable secret God
visits all sins On you has fallen at last the payment THAT I believe
You cant run away any more than a child can run away from the cupboard
it has been locked into for a punishment Whos going to hear you now
You have deliberately refused to make a friend of me Fight it out
alone then

Lawford heard the door close and the dying away of the sound that had
been the unceasing accompaniment of all these later yearsthe rustling
of his wifes skirts her crisp authoritative footstep And he turned
towards the flooding sunlight that streamed in on the upturned surface
of the lookingglass No clear decisive thought came into his mind only
a vague recognition that so far as Sheila was concerned this was the
end No regret no remorse visited him He was just alone again that
was allalone as in reality he had always been alone without having
the sense or power to see or to acknowledge it All he had said had been
the mere flotsam of the moment and now it stood stark and irrevocable
between himself and the past

He sat down dazed and stupid Again and again a struggling recollection
tried to obtrude itself again and again he beat it back And rather
for something to distract his attention than for any real interest
or enlightenment he might find in its pages he took out the grimy
dogseared book that Herbert had given him and turned slowly over the
leaves till he came to Sabathier once more Snatches of remembrance of
their long talk returned to him but just as that dark waterhaunted
house had seemed to banish remembrance and the reality of the room in
which he now sat and of the old familiar life so now the house the
faces of yesterday seemed in their turn unreal almost spectral and
the thick print on the smudgy page no more significant than a story one
reads and throws away

But a moments comparison in the glass of the two faces side by
side suddenly sharpened his attentionthe resemblance was so oddly
arresting and yet and yet so curiously inconclusive There was then
something of the stolid old Saxon left he thought Or had it been
regained Which was it Not merely the complexity of the question but
a halfconscious distaste of attempting to face it set him reading very
slowly and laboriously for his French was little more than fragmentary
recollection the first few pages of the life of this buried Sabathier
But with a disinclination almost amounting to aversion he made very slow
progress Many of the words were meaningless to him and every other
moment he found himself listening with intense concentration for the
least hint of what Sheila was doing of what was going on in the house
beneath him He had not very long to wait He was sitting with his head
leaning on his hand the book unheeded beneath the other on the table
when the door opened again behind him and Sheila entered She stood for
a moment calm and dignified looking down on him through her veil

Please understand Arthur that I am not taking this step in pique
or even in anger It would serve no purpose to go on like thisthis
incessant heedlessness and recrimination There have been mistakes
misconceptions perhaps on both sides To me naturally yours are most
conspicuous That need not however blind me to my own

She paused in vain for an answer

Think the whole thing over candidly and quietly she began again in a
quiet rapid voice Have you really shown the slightest regard I wont
say for me or even for Alice but for just the obvious difficulties
andand proprieties of our position I have given up as far as I
can brooding on and on over the same horrible impossible thoughts I
withdraw unreservedly what I said just now about punishment Whatever
the evidence it is not even a wifes place to judge like that You will
forgive me that

Lawford did not turn his head Of course he said looking rather
vacantly out of the window it was only in the heat of the moment
Sheila though who knows it may be true

Well she took hold of the great brass knob at the foot of the bed
with one gloved handwell I feel it is my duty to withdraw it Apart
from it I see only too clearly that even though all that has happened
in these last few days was in reality nothing but a horrible nightmare
I see that even then what you have said about our married life together
can never be recalled You have told me quite deliberately that for
years past your life has been nothing but a pretencea sham You
implied that mine had been too Honestly I was not aware of it Arthur
But supposing all that has happened to you had been merely what might
happen at any moment to anybody some actual defacement you will
forgive me suggesting such a horrible thingwhy if what you say is
true even in that case my sympathy would have been only a continual
fret and annoyance to you And thisthis change I own is infinitely
harder to bear It would be an outrage on common sense and on all that
we hold seemly andand sacred in life even in some trumpery story You
do you must see all that Arthur

Oh yes said Lawford narrowing his eyes to pierce through the
sunlight I see all that

Then we need not go over it all again Whatever others may say
or think I shall still at least so long as nothing occurs to the
contrary keep firmly to my present convictions Mr Bethany has assured
me repeatedly that he has nono misgivings that he understands And
even if I still doubted which I dont Arthur though it would be
rather trying to have to accept ones husband at secondhand as it
were I should have to be satisfied I dare say even such an unheardof
thing as what we are discussing now or something equally ghastly does
occur occasionally In foreign countries perhaps I have not studied
such things enough to say We were all very much restricted in our
reading as children and I honestly think not unwisely It is enough
for the present to repeat that I do believe and that whatever may
happenand I know absolutely nothing about the procedure in such
casesbut whatever may happen I shall still be loyal I shall always
have your interests at heart Her words faltered and she turned her
head away You did love me once Arthur I cant forget that The
contralto voice trembled ever so little and the gloved hand smoothed
gently the brass knob beneath

If said Lawford resting his face on his hands and curiously
watching the while his moving reflection in the lookingglass before
himif I said I still loved you what then

But you have already denied it Arthur

Yes but if I said that that too was said only in haste that brooding
over the trouble thisthis metamorphosis was bringing on us all had
driven me almost beyond endurance supposing that I withdrew all that
and instead said now that I do still love you just as I he turned a
little and turned back again like this

Sheila paused Could ANY woman answer such a question she almost
sighed at last

Yes but Lawford pressed on in a voice almost naive and stubborn as
a childs If I tried toto make you I did once Sheila

I cant I cant conceive such a position Surely that alone is almost
as frantic as it is heartless Is it is it even right

Well I have not actually asked it I own he added moodily almost
under his breath it would bedangerous But there Sheila this
poor old mask of mine is wearing out I am somehow convinced of that
What will be left God only knows You were saying He rose abruptly
Please please sit down he said I did not notice you were
standing

I shall not keep you a moment she answered hurriedly I will sit
here The truth is Arthur she began again almost solemnly apart
from all sentiment andand good intentions my presence here only
harasses you and keeps you back I am not so bound up in myself that I
cannot realise THAT The consequence is that after calmlyand I
hope consideratelythinking the whole thing over I have come to the
conclusion that it would arouse very little comment the least possible
perhaps in the circumstances if I just went away for a few days You
are not in any sense ill In fact I have never known you soso robust
so energetic You will be alone Mr Bethany perhaps You could go
out and come in just as you pleased Possibly Sheila smiled frankly
beneath her veil even this Dr Ferguson you have invented will be a
help Its only the servants that remain to be considered

I should prefer to be quite alone

Then do not worry about THEM I can easily explain And if you would
not mind letting her in Mrs Gull can come in every other day or so just
to keep things in order Shes entirely trustworthy and discreet Or
perhaps if you would prefer

Mrs Gull will do nicely Sheila Its very good of you to have given me
so much thought A long and rather arduous pause followed

Oh one other thing Arthur You sent out to Mr Critchettdo you
rememberthe night you first came home I think too after the first
awful shock when we were sitting in our bedroom you actually referred
toto violent measures You will promise me I may perhaps at least ask
that you will promise me on your word of honour for Alices sake if
not for mine to do nothing rash

Yes yes said Lawford sinking lower even than he had supposed
possible into the thin and lightless chill of ennuinothing rash

Sheila rose with a sigh only in part suppressed I have not seen Mr
Bethany again I think however it would be better to let Harry know I
mean dear of your derangement After all he is one of the familyat
least of mine He will not interfere He would perhaps quite
naturally be hurt if we did not take him into our confidence Otherwise
there is no pressing cause for haste at least for another week or so
After that I suppose something will have to be done Then theres Mr
Wedderburn wouldnt it be as well to let him know that at least for the
present you are quite unable to think of returning to town That
too in time will have to be arranged I suppose if nothing happens
meanwhile I mean if things dont come right And I do hope Arthur you
will not set your mind too closely on what may only prove false hopes
This is all intensely painful to me of course to us both

Again Lawford even though he did not turn to confront it became
conscious of the black veil turned towards him tentatively
speculatively impenetrably

Yes he said Ill write to Wedderburn hes had his ups and downs
too

I always rather fancied so said Sheila reflectively he looks rather
aa restless man Oh and then again she broke off quickly theres
the question of money I supposeit is only a conjectureI suppose it
would be better to do nothing in that direction just for the present
Ada has now gone to the Bank Fifty pounds Arthur it is out of my own
private accountdo you think that will be enough just of course for
your PRESENT needs

As a bribe hushmoney or a thankoffering Sheila murmured her
husband wearily

I dont follow you replied the discreet voice from beneath the veil

He did actually turn this time and glance steadily over his shoulder
How long are you going for and where

I proposed to go to my cousins Bettie Lovats that is of course if
you have no objection Its near it will be a longdeferred visit and
she need know very little And of course if for the least thing in the
world you should want me there I am within call as it were And you
will write We ARE acting for the best Arthur

So long as it is your best Sheila

Sheila pondered You think you mean theyll all say I ought to have
stayed Candidly I cant see it in that light Surely every experience
of life proves that in intimate domestic matters and especially in
those between husband and wife only the parties concerned have any
means of judging what is best for them It has been our experience at
any rate though I must in fairness confess that outwardly at least
I havent had much of that kind of thing to complain of Sheila paused
again for a reply

What kind of thing

Domestic experience dear

The house was quiet There was not a sound stirring in the still
sunny road of orchards and discreet and drowsy villas A long silence
followed immensely active and alert on the one side almost morbidly
lethargic so far as the stooping figure in front of the lookingglass
was concerned At last the last haunting question came in a kind of
croak as if only by a supreme effort could it be compelled to produce
itself for consideration

And Alice Sheila

Alice dear of course goes with ME

You realise he stirred uneasily you realise it may be final

My dear Arthur cried Sheila it is surely apart from mere delicacy
a parental obligation to screen the poor child from the shock Could she
be at such a time in any better keeping than her mothers At present
she only vaguely guesses To know definitely that her father infinitely
worse than death hadhadOh is it possible to realise anything in
this awful cloud It would kill her outright

Lawford made no stir The quietest of raps came at the door The money
from the Bank maam said a faint voice

Sheila carefully opened the door a few inches She laid the blue
envelope on the dressingtable at her husbands elbow You had better
perhaps count it she said in a low voiceforty in notes the rest
in gold and narrowed her eyes beneath her veil upon her husbands very
peculiar method of forgetting his responsibilities

French she said with a nod How very quaint

Lawfords eyes fell and rested gravely on the dingy page of Herberts
meanlooking bundle of print A queer feeling of cold crept over him
Yes he said vaguely French and hopelessly failed to fill in the
silence that seemed like some rather sleek nocturnal creature quietly
waiting to be fed

Sheila swept softly towards the door Well Arthur I think that is
all The servants will have gone by this evening I have ordered a
carriage for halfpast twelve Perhaps you would first write down
anything that occurs to you to be necessary Perhaps too it would be
better if Dr Simon were told that we shall not need him any more
that you are thinking of a complete change of scene a voyage He is
obviously useless Besides Mr Bethany I think is going to discuss
a specialist with you I have written him a little note just briefly
explaining Shall I write to Dr Simon too

You remember everything said Lawford and it seemed to him it was a
remark he had heard ages and ages ago Its only this money Sheila
will you please take that away

Take it away

I think Sheila if I do take a voyage I should almost prefer to work
my passage As for a mere change of scene thats quite uncostly

It is only your face Arthur said Sheila solemnly that suggest
these wicked stabs Some day you will perhaps repent of every one

It is possible Sheila we none of us stand still you know One rips
open a lid sometimes and the wax face rots before ones eyes Take back
your blue envelope and thank you for thinking of me Its always the
woman of the house that has the head

I wish said Sheila almost pathetically and yet with a faint quaver
of resignation I wish it could be said that the man of the house
sometimes has the heart Think it over Arthur

Sheila with her husbands luncheon tray brought also her farewells
Lawford surveyed not without a faint shy stirring of incredulity
the superbly restrained presence He stood before her drylipped
inarticulate a schoolboy caught redhanded in the shabbiest of offences

It is your wish then that I go Arthur she said pleadingly

He handed her her money without a word

Very well Arthur if you wont take it she said I should scarcely
have thought this the occasion for mere pride

The tenth she continued as she squeezed the envelope into her purse
with only the least hardening of voice although I daresay you have not
troubled to remember itthe tenth will be the eighteenth anniversary
of our weddingday It makes parting however advisable and though only
for the few days we should think nothing of in happier circumstances
a little harder to bear But there all will come right You will see
things in a different light perhaps Words may wound but time will
heal But even as she now looked closely into his colourless sunken
face some distant memory seemed to well up irresistiblythe memory of
eyes just as ingenuous and as unassuming that even in claiming her love
had expressed only their stolid unworthiness

Did you know it have you seen it she said stooping forward a
little I believe in spite of all He gazed on solemnly almost
owlishly out of his fading mask

Wait till Mr Bethany tells you you will believe it perhaps from him
He saw the greygloved hand a little reluctantly lifted towards him

Goodbye Sheila he said and turned mechanically back to the window

She hesitated listening to a small faraway voice that kept urging her
with an almost froglike pertinacity to do to say something and yet as
stubbornly would not say what and she was gone



CHAPTER FIFTEEN

Raying and gleaming in the sunlight the hired landau drove up to the
gate Lawford peeping between the blinds looked down on the coachman
with reins hanging loosely from his red squatthumbed hand seated in
his tight livery and indescribable hat on the faded cushions One thing
only was in his mind and it was almost with an audible cry that he
turned towards the figure that edged white and trembling into the
chill room to fling herself into his arms Dont look at me he
begged her only remember dearest I would rather have died down
there and been never seen again than have given you pain Runrun your
mothers calling Write to me think of me goodbye

He threw himself on the bed and lay there till eveningtill the door
had shut gently behind the last rat to leave the sinking ship All
the clearness the calmness were gone again Round and round in dizzy
sickening flare and clatter his thoughts whirled Contempt fear
loathing blasphemy laughter longing there was no end Death was no
end There was no meaning no refuge no hope no possible peace To
give up was to go to perdition to go forward was to go mad And even
madnesshe sat up with trembling lips in the twilightmadness itself
was only a state only a state You might be bereaved and the pain
and hopelessness of that would pass You might be cast out betrayed
deserted and still be you still find solitude lovely and in a brave
face a friend But madnessit surged in on him with all the clearness
and emptiness of a dream And he sat quite still his hand clutching the
bedclothes his head askew waiting for the sound of footsteps for the
presences and the voices that have their thinwalled dwelling beneath
the shallow crust of consciousness

Inky blackness drifted up in wisps in smoke before his eyes he was
powerless to move to cry out There was no room to turn no air to
breathe And yet there was a low continuous nevervarying stir as of
an enormous wheel whirling in the gloom Countless infinitesimal faces
arched like glimmering pebbles the huge dimcoloured vault above his
head He heard a voice above the monstrous rustling of the wheel
clamouring calling him back He was hastening headlong muttering to
himself his own flat meaningless name like a child repeating as he runs
his errand And then as if in a charmed cold pool he awoke and opened
his eyes again on the gathering darkness of the great bedroom and heard
a quick importunate longcontinued knocking on the door below as of
some one who had already knocked in vain

Cramped and heavylimbed he felt his way across the room and lit a
candle He stood listening awhile his eyes fixed on the door that hung
a little open All in the room seemed acutely fantastically still The
flame burned dim misled in the sluggish air He stole slowly to the
door looked out and again listened Again the knocking broke out more
impetuously and yet with a certain restraint and caution Shielding the
flame of his candle in the shell of his left hand Lawford moved slowly
with chin uplifted to the stairs He bent forward a little and stood
motionless and drawn up the pupils of his eyes slowly contracting and
expanding as he gazed down into the carpeted vacant gloom past the dim
louring presence that had fallen back before him

His mouth opened Whos there at last he called

Thank God thank God he heard Mr Bethany mutter I mustnt call
Lawford came a hurried whisper as if the old gentleman were pressing
his lips to speak through the letterbox Come down and open the door
theres a good fellow Ive been knocking no end of a time

Yes I am coming said Lawford He shut his mouth and held his
breath and stair by stair he descended driving steadily before him the
crouching gloating menacing shape darkly lifted up before him against
the darkness contending the way with him

Are you ill Are you hurt Has anything happened Lawford came the
anxious old voice again striving in vain to be restrained

No no muttered Lawford I am coming coming slowly He paused to
breathe his hands trembling his hair lank with sweat and still
with eyes wide open he descended against the phantom lurking in the
darknessan adversary that if he should but for one moment close his
lids he felt would master sanity and imagination with its evil So
long as you dont get in he heard himself muttering so long as you
dont get in my friend

Whats that youre saying came up the muffled querulous voice I
cant for the life of me hear my boy

Nothing nothing came softly the answer from the foot of the stairs
I was only speaking to myself

Deliberately with candle held rigidly on a level with his eyes Lawford
pushed forward a pace or two into the airless empty drawingroom and
grasped the handle of the door He gazed in awhile a black oblique
shadow flung across his face his eyes fixed like an animals then drew
the door steadily towards him And suddenly some power that had held him
tense seemed to fail He thrust out his head and his face quivering
with fear and loathing spat defiance as if in a passion of triumph into
the gloom

Still muttering he shut the door and turned the key In another moment
his light was gleaming out on the grey perturbed face and black narrow
shoulders of his visitor

You gave me quite a fright said the old man almost angrily have you
hurt your foot or something

It was very dark said Lawford down the stairs

What said Mr Bethany still more angrily blinking out of his
unspectacled eyes has she cut off the gas then

You got the note said Lawford unmoved

Yes yes I got the note Gone

Oh yes all gone It was my choice I preferred it so

Mr Bethany sat down on one of the hard old wooden chairs that stood on
either side of the lofty hall and breathing rather thickly rested his
hands on his knees Whats happened he inquired looking up into the
candle I forgot my glasses old fool that I am and cant my dear
fellow see you very plainly But your voice

I think said Lawford I think its beginning to come back

What the whole thing Oh no my dear dear man be frank with me not
the whole thing

Yes said Lawford the whole thingvery very gradually
imperceptibly I think even Sheila noticed But I rather feel it than
see it that is all Im cornering him

Him

Lawford jerked his candle as if towards some definite goal In time
he said

The two faces with the candle between them seemed as it were to gain
light each from the other

Well well said Mr Bethany every man for himself Lawford its the
only way But whats going to be done We must be cautious must think
ofof the others

Oh that said Lawford shes going to squeeze me out

Youvesquabbled Oh but my dear honest old HONEST old idiot there
are scores of families here in this parish within a stones throw that
squabble wrangle all but politely tear each others eyes out every
day of their earthly lives Its perfectly natural Where should we poor
old busybodies be else Peace on earth we bring and its mainly between
husband and wife

Yes said Lawford but you see this was not our earthly life It was
between US

Listen listen to the dear mystic exclaimed the old creature
scoffingly What depths were touching Heres the first serious break
of his lifetime and hes gone stark staring transcendental Ah well
He paused and glanced quickly about him with his curious birdlike
poise of head But youre not alone here he inquired suddenly not
absolutely alone

Yes said Lawford But theres plenty to think aboutand read I
havent thought or read for years

No nor I after thirty my dear boy one merely annotates and the
books called Life Bless me his solemn old voice is grinding epigrams
out of even this poor old parochial barrelorgan You dont suppose you
cannot be supposing you are the only serious person in the world Whats
more its only skin deep

Lawford smiled Skin deep But think quietly over it youll see Im
done

Come here said Mr Bethany Wheres the whiskey wheres the cigars
You shall smoke and drink and Ill watch If it werent for a
pitiful old stomach Id join you Come on He led the way into the
diningroom

He looked sparer more wizened and sinewy than ever as he stooped to
open the sideboard Where on earth do they keep everything he was
muttering to himself

Lawford put the candlestick down on the table Theres only one thing
he said watching his visitors rummaging what precisely do you think
they will do with me

Look here Lawford snapped Mr Bethany Ive come round here hooting
through your letterbox to tally sense not sentiment Why has your
wife deserted you Without a servant without a singleIts perfectly
monstrous

On my word of honour I prefer it so I couldnt have gone on Alone
I all but forget thisthis lupus Every turn of her little finger
reminded me of it We are all of us alone whether we know it or
not you said so yourself And its better to realize it stark and
unconfused Besides you have no idea whatwhat odd things There
may be there IS something on the other side Ill win through to that

Mr Bethany had been listening attentively He scrambled up from his
knees with a halfempty syphon of sodawater See here Lawford he
said if you really want to know whats your most insidious and most
dangerous symptom just now it is spiritual pride Youve won what you
think a domestic victory and you can scarcely bear the splendour
Oh you may shrug Pray what IS this other side which the superior
doublefaced creatures going to win through to now He rapped it out
almost bitterly almost contemptuously

Lawford hardly heard the question Before his eyes had suddenly arisen
the peace the friendly unquestioning stillness the thunderous lullaby
old as the grave Its only a fancy It seemed I could begin again

Well look here said Mr Bethany his whole face suddenly lined and
grey with age You cant Its the one solitary thing Ive got to say
as Ive said it to myself morn noon and night these scores of years
You cant begin again its all a delusion and a snare You say were
alone So we are The worlds a dream a stage a mirage a rack call
it what you willbut YOU dont change YOURE no illusion Theres
no crying off for YOU no ravelling out no clean leaves Youve got
thisthis trouble this afflictionmy dear dear fellow what shall
I say to tell you how I grieve and groan for you oh yes and actually
laughed I confess it a vile hysterical laughter to think of it
Youve got this almost intolerable burden to bear its come like a
thief in the night but bear it you must and ALONE They say deaths a
going to bed I doubt it but anyhow lifes a long undressing We came
in puling and naked and every stitch must come off before we get out
again We must stand on our feet in all our Rabelaisian nakedness and
watch the world fade Well then and not another word of sense shall you
worm out of my wornout old brains after todayall I say is dont give
in Why if you stood here now freed from this devilish disguise the
old fat sluggish fellow that sat and yawned his head off under my eyes
in his pew the Sunday before last if I know anything about human nature
Id say it to your face and a fig for your vanity and resignationyour
last state would be worse than the first There

He bunched up a big white handkerchief and mopped it over his head
Thats done he said and we wont go back What I want to know now
is what are you going to do Where are you sleeping What are you going
to think about Ill stayyes yes thats what it must be I must
stay And I detest strange beds Ill stay you SHANT be alone Do you
hear me Lawfordyou SHANT be alone

Lawford gazed gravely There is just one little thing I want to ask
you before you go Ive wormed out an extraordinary old French book
andjust as you sayto pass the time Ive been having a shot at
translating it But Im frightfully rusty its old French would you
mind having a look

Mr Bethany blinked and listened He tried for the twentieth time to
judge his friends eyes to gain as best he could some sustained and
unobserved glance at this baffling face Where is your precious French
book he said irritably

Its upstairs

Fire away then Lawford rose and glanced about the room What no
light there either snapped Mr Bethany Take this I dont mind the
dark Therell be plenty of that for me soon

Lawford hesitated at the door looking rather strangely back No
he said there are matches upstairs He shut the door after him The
darkness seemed cold and still as water He went slowly up with eyes
fixed wide on the floating luminous gloom and out of memory seemed to
gather as faintly as in the darkness which they had exorcised for him
the strange pitiful eyes of the night before And as he mounted a chill
terrible physical peace seemed to steal over him

Mr Bethany was sitting as he had left him looking steadily on the
floor when Lawford returned He flattened out the book on the table
with a sniff of impatience And dragging the candle nearer and stooping
his nose close to the fusty print he began to read

Was this in the house he inquired presently

No said Lawford it was lent to me by a friendHerbert

Hm dont know him Anyhow precious poor stuff this is
This Sabathier whoever he is seems to be a kind of claptrap
eighteenthcentury adventurer who thought the world would be better off
apparently for a long account of all his sentimental amours Rousseau
with a touch of Don Quixote in his composition and an echo of that
prince of bogies Poe What in the name of wonder induced you to fix
on this for your holiday reading

Sabathiers alive isnt he

I never said he wasnt Hes a good deal too much alive for my old
wits with his Mamselle This and Madame the Other interesting enough
perhaps for the professional literary nose with a taste for patchouli

Yet I suppose even that is not a very rare character Mr Bethany
peered up from the dingy book at his ingenuous questioner I should say
decidedly that the fellow was a very rare character so long as by rare
you dont mean good Its one of the dullest stupidities of the present
day my dear fellow to dote on a man simply because hes different
from the rest of us Once a man strays out of the common herd hes
more likely to meet wolves in the thickets than angels From what I can
gather in just these few pages this Sabathier appears to have been
an amorous adventurous emotional Frenchman who went to the dogs as
easily and as rapidly as his own nature and his period allowed And I
should say Lawford that he made precious bad reading for a poor old
troubled hermit like yourself at the present moment

Theres a portrait of him a few pages back

Mr Bethany with some little impatience turned back to the engraving
Nicholas de Sabathiers he muttered De indeed He poked in at
the foxy print with narrowed eyes I dont deny its a striking even
perhaps a rather taking face I dont deny it He gazed on with
an even more acute concentration and looked up sharply Look here
Lawford what in the name of wonderwhat trick are you playing on me
now

Trick said Lawford and the world fell with the tiniest plash in the
silence like a vivid little float upon the surface of a shadowy pool

The old face flushed What conceivable bearing I say has this dead
and gone old roue on us now

You dont think then you see any resemblanceANY resemblance at
all

Resemblance repeated Mr Bethany in a flat voice and without raising
his face again to meet Lawfords direct scrutiny Resemblance to whom

To me To me as I am

But even my dear fellow forgive my dull old brains even if there
was just the faintest superficial suggestion ofof that what then

Why said Lawford hes buried in Widderstone

Buried in Widderstone The keen childlike blue eyes looked almost
stealthily up across the book the old man sat without speaking so
still that it might even be supposed he himself was listening for a
quiet distant footfall

He is buried in the grave beside which I fell asleep said Lawford
all green and still and broken he added faintly You remember he
went on in a repressed voiceyou remember you asked me if there was
anybody else in sight any eavesdropper You dont thinkhim

Mr Bethany pushed the book a few inches away from him Who did you
saywho was it you said put the thing into your head A queer friend
surely he paused helplessly And how pray do you know he began
again more firmly even if there is a Sabathier buried at Widderstone
how do you know it is this Sabathier Its not I think he added
boldly a very uncommon name with two bs at any rate Whereabouts is
the grave

Quite down at the bottom under the trees And the little seat I told
you of is there too where I fell asleep You see he explained the
graves almost isolated I suppose because he killed himself

Mr Bethany clasped his knuckled fingers on the tablecloth Its no
good he concluded after a long pause the fellows got up into
my head I cant think him out We must thrash it out quietly in the
morning with the blessed sun at the window not this farthing dip To
me the whole idea is as revolting as it is incredible Why above a
centuryno no And on the other hand how easily ones fancy builds A
few straws and theres a nest and squawking fledglings all complete
Is that whyis that why that good practical wife of yours and all your
faithful household have absconded Does ithe threw up his head as if
towards the house above themdoes it REEK with him

Lawford shook his head She hasnt seen him notnot apart I havent
told her

Mr Bethany tossed the huggermugger of pamphlets across the table
Then for simple sanitys sake dont Hide it burn it put the thing
completely out of your mind A friend Who where is this wonderful
friend

Not very far from Widderstone He livespractically alone

And all that stumbling and muttering on the stairs he leant forward
almost threateningly There isnt anybody here Lawford

Oh no said Lawford We are practically alone with this you know
he pointed to the book and smiled frankly however faintly

Again Mr Bethany sank into a fixed yet uneasy reverie and again shook
himself and raised his eyes

Well then he said in a voice all but morose in its fretfullness
what I suggest is that first you keep quiet here and next that you
write and get your wife back You say you are better I think you said
she herself noticed a slight improvement Isnt it just exactly as I
foresaw And yet shes gone But thats not our business Get her back
And dont for a single instant waste a thought on the other not for a
single instant I implore you Lawford And in a week the whole thing
will be no more than a dreary preposterous dream You dont answer
me he cried impulsively

But can one so easily forget a dream like this

You dont speak out Lawford you mean SHE wont

It must at least seem to have been in part of my own seeking or
contriving or at any rateshe said itof my own hereditary or
unconscious deserving

She said that Mr Bethany sat back I see I see he said Im
nothing but a fumbling old meddler And there was I not ten minutes
ago preaching for all I was worth on a text I knew nothing about God
bless me Lawford how long we take alearning Ill say no more But
what an illusion To think thisthishe laid a long lean hand at arms
length flat upon the table towards his friendto think this is our old
jogtrot Arthur Lawford From henceforth I throw you over you old wolf
in sheeps wool I wash my hands of you And now where am I going to
sleep

He covered up his age and weariness for an instant with a small crooked
hand

Lawford took a deep breath Youre going old friend to sleep at home
And IIm going to give you my arm to the Vicarage gate Here I am
immeasurably relieved fitter than Ive been since I was a dolt of a
schoolboy On my word of honour I cant say why but I am I dont care
THAT vicar honestlypuffed up with spiritual pride If a man cant
sleep with pride for a bedfellow well hed better try elsewhere Its
no good Im as stubborn as a mule thats at least a relic of the old
Adam I care no more he raised his voice firmly and gravelyI
dont care a jot for solitude not a jot for all the ghosts of all the
catacombs

Mr Bethany listened grimly pursed up his lips Not a jot for all the
ghosts of all the catechisms he muttered Nor the devil himself I
suppose He turned once more to glance sharply in the direction of the
face he could so dimlyand of set purposediscern and without a word
trotted off into the hall Lawford followed with the candle

Pon my word you havent had a mouthful of supper Let me forage just
a quarter of an hour eh

Not me said Mr Bethany if you wont have me home I go I refuse
to encourage this miserable grasswidowering What WOULD they say
What would the busybodies say Ghouls and graves and shocking
mysteriesSelina Sister Anne Come on

He shuffled on his hat and caught firm hold of his knobbed umbrella
Better not leave a candle he said

Lawford blew out the candle

What What called the old man suddenly But no voice had spoken

A thin trickle of light from the lamp in the street stuck up through
the fanlight as with a smile that could be described neither as
mischievous saturnine nor vindictive and was yet faintly suggestive
of all three Lawford quietly opened the drawingroom door and put down
the candlestick on the floor within

What on earth my good man are you fumbling after now came the
almost fretful question from under the echoing porch

Coming coming said Lawford and slammed the door behind them




CHAPTER SIXTEEN

The first faint streaks of dawn were silvering across the stars when
Lawford again let himself into his deserted house He stumbled down
to the pantry and cut himself a crust of bread and cheese and ate it
sitting on the table watching the leafy eastern sky through the painted
bars of the area window He munched on hungry and tired His night
walk had cooled head and heart Having obstinately refused Mr Bethanys
invitation to sleep at the Vicarage he had sat down on an old low wall
and watched until his light had shone out at his bedroom window Then
he had simply wandered on past rustling glimmering gardens under
the great timbers of yellowing elms hardly thinking hardly aware
of himself except as in a faraway vision of a sluggish insignificant
creature struggling across the tossedup crust of an old
incomprehensible world

The secret of his content in that long leisurely ramble had been
that repeatedly by a scarcely realised effort it had not lain in the
direction of Widderstone And now as he sat hungrily devouring his
breakfast on the table in the kitchen with the daybreak comforting his
eyes he thought with a positive mockery of that poor old nightthing
he had given inch by inch into the safe keeping of his pink and white
drawingroom Don Quixote Poe Rousseauthey were familiar but not
very significant labels to a mind that had found very poor entertainment
in reading But they were at least representative enough to set him
wondering which of their influences it was that had inflated with such
a gaseous heroism the Lawford of the night before He thought of Sheila
with a not unkindly smile and of the rest I wonder what theyll do
had been a question almost as much in his mind during these last few
hours as had What am I to do in the first bout of his visitation

But the they was not very precisely visualised He saw Sheila and
Harry and dainty paleblue Bettie Lovat and cautious old Wedderburn
and Danton and Craik and cheery gossipy Dr Sutherland and the
verger Mr Dutton and Critchett and the gardener and Ada and the
whole vague populous host that keep one as definitely in ones place in
the worlds economy as a firmset pin the camphored moth What his place
was to be only time could show Meanwhile there was in this loneliness
at least a respite

Solitudehe bathed his weary bones in it He laved his eyelids in
it as in a woodland brook after the heat of noon He sat on in calmest
reverie till his hunger was satisfied Then scattering out his last
crumbs to the birds from the barred window he climbed upstairs again
past his usual bedroom past his detested guest room up into the narrow
sweetness of Alices and flinging himself on her bed fell into a long
and dreamless sleep

By ten next morning Lawford had bathed and dressed And at halfpast ten
he got up from Sheilas fat little French dictionary and his Memoirs to
answer Mrs Gulls summons on the area bell The little woman stood with
arms folded over an empty and capacious bag with an air of sustained
melancholy on her friendly face She wished him a very nervous Good
morning and dived down into the kitchen The hours dragged slowly by
in a silence broken only by an occasional ring at the bell About three
she emerged from the house and climbed the area steps with her bag
hooked over her arm He watched the little black figure out of
sight watched a man in a white canvas hat ascend the steps to push a
blueprinted circular through the letterbox It had begun to rain a
little He returned to the breakfastroom and with the window wide open
to the rustling coolness of the leaves edged his way very slowly across
from line to line of the obscure French print

Sabathier none the less and in spite of his unintelligible
literariness did begin to take shape and consistency The man himself
breathing and thinking began to live for Lawford even in those few
halfarticulate pages though not in quite so formidable a fashion as
Mr Bethany had summed him up But as the west began to lighten with the
declining sun the same old disquietude the same old friendless and
foreboding ennui stole over Lawfords solitude once more He shut his
books placed a candlestick and two boxes of matches on the hall table
lit a bead of gas and went out into the rainysweet streets again

At a mean little barbers with a pole above his lettered door he went
in to be shaved And a few steps further on he sat down at the
crumblittered counter of a little bakers shop to have some tea It
pleased him almost to childishness to find how easily he could listen
and even talk to the oiled and crimpy little barber and to the pretty
consumptivelooking printdressed bakers wife Whatever his face might
now be conniving at the Arthur Lawford of last week could never have
hobnobbed so affably with his social inferiors

For no reason in the world unless to spend a moment or two longer
in the friendly bakers shop he bought sixpennyworth of cakes He
watched them as they were deposited one by one in the bag and even
asked for one sort to be exchanged for another flushing a little at the
pretty compliment he had ventured on

He climbed out of the shop and paused on the wooden doorstep Do you
happen to know Mr Herbert Herberts he said

The bakers wife glanced up at him with clear reflective eyes Mr
Herbertsthat must be some little way off sir I dont know any such
name and I know most just round about like

Well yes it is said Lawford rather foolishly I hardly know why I
asked Its past the churchyard at Widderstone

Oh yes sir she encouraged him

A big woodenlooking house

Really sir Wooden

Lawford looked into her face but could find nothing more to say so he
smiled again rather absently and ascended into the street

He sat down outside the churchyard gate on the very bank where he had in
the sourness of the nettles first opened Sabathiers Memoirs The world
lay still beneath the pale sky Presently the little fat rector walked
up the hill his wrists still showing beneath his sleeves Lawford
meditatively watched him pass by A small boy with a switch a tiny
nose and a swinging gallipot his cheeks lit with the sunset followed
soon after Lawford beckoned him with his finger and held out the bag
of tarts He watched him half incredulous of his prize and with many a
cautious look over his shoulder pass out of sight For a long while
he sat alone only the evening birds singing out of the greenness and
silence of the churchyard What a haunting inescapable riddle life was

Colour suddenly faded out of the light streaming between the branches
And depression always lying in ambush of the novelty of his freedom
began like mist to rise above his restless thoughts It was all so
devilish emptythis raft of the world floating under evenings shadow
How many sermons had he listened to enriched with the simile of the
ocean of life Here they were come home to roost He had fallen asleep
ineffectual sailor that he was and a thief out of the cloudy deep had
stolen oar and sail and compass leaving him adrift amid the riding of
the waves

Are they worth do you think quite a penny suddenly inquired a quiet
voice in the silence He looked up into the almost colourless face into
the grey eyes beneath their clear narrow brows

I was thinking he said what a curious thing life is and
wondering

The first half is well worth the pennyits originality I cant afford
twopence So you must GIVE me what you were wondering

Lawford gazed rather blankly across the twilight fields I was
wondering he said with an oddly naive candour how long it took one
to sink

They say you know Grisel replied solemnly drowned sailors float
midway suffering their sea change purgatory But what a splendid
pennyworth All pure philosophy

Philosophy said Lawford I am a perfect fool Has your brother
told you about me

She glanced at him quickly We had a talk

Then you do know He stopped dead and turned to her You really
realise it looking at me now

I realise she said gravely that you look even a little more pale
and haggard than when I saw you first the other night We both my
brother and I you know thought for certain youd come yesterday
In fact I went into the Widderstone in the evening to look for you
knowing your nocturnal habits She glanced again at him with a kind
of shy anxiety

Whywhy is your brother sowhy does he let me bore him so horribly

Does he Hes tremendously interested but then hes pretty easily
interested when hes interested at all If he can possibly twist
anything into the slightest show of a mystery he will But of course
you wont you cant take all he says seriously The tiniest pinch of
salt you know Hes an absolute fanatic at talking in the air Besides
it doesnt really matter much

In the air

I mean if once a theory gets into his headthe more farfetched
so long as its original the betterit flowers out into a positive
miracle of incredibilities And of course you can rout out evidence for
anything under the sun from his dingy old folios Why did he lend you
that PARTICULAR book

Didnt he tell you that then

He said it was Sabathier She seemed to think intensely for the
merest fraction of a moment and turned Honestly though I think he
immensely exaggerated the likeness As for

He touched her arm and they stopped again face to face Tell me what
difference exactly you see he said I am quite myself again now
honestly please tell me just the very worst you think

I think to begin with she began with exaggerated candour his is
rather a detestable face

And mine he said gravely

Whyvery troubled oh yesbut his was like some bird of prey
Yourswhat mad stuff to talk like thisnot the least symptom that I
can see ofwhy the prey you know

They had come to the wicket in the dark thorny hedge Would it be very
dreadful to walk on a littlejust to finish

Very she said turning as gravely at his side

What I wanted to say was began Lawford and forgetting altogether
the thread by which he hoped to lead up to what he really wanted to
say broke off lamely I should have thought you would have absolutely
despised a coward

It would be rather absurd to despise what one so horribly well
understands Besides we werent cowardswe werent cowards a bit My
childhood was one long reiterated terrornights and nights of it But
I never had the pluck to tell any one No one so much as dreamt of
the company I had Ah and you didnt see either that my heart was
absolutely in my mouth that I was shrivelled up with fear even at
sight of the fear on your face in the dark Theres absolutely nothing
so catching So you see I do know a little what nerves are and
dream too sometimes though I dont choose charnelhouses if I can get a
comfortable bed A coward May I really say that to ask my help was one
of the bravest things in a man I ever heard of Bulletsthat kind of
courageno real woman cares twopence for bullets An old aunt of mine
stared a man right out of the house with the thing in her face Anyhow
whether I may or not I do say it So now we are quits

Will you began Lawford and stopped What I wanted to say was
he jerked on it is sheer horrible hypocrisy to be talking to you like
thisthough you will never have the faintest idea of what it has meant
and done for me I mean And yet and yet I do feel when just for
the least moment I forget what I am and that isnt very often when
I forget what I have become and what I must go back toI feel that I
havent any business to be talking with you at all Quits And here I
am an outcast from decent society Ah you dont know

She bent her head and laughed under her breath You do really stumble
on such delicious compliments And yet do you know I think my brother
would be immensely pleased to think you were an outcast from decent
society if only he could be thought one too He has been trying half his
life to wither decent society with neglect and disdainbut it doesnt
take the least notice The deaf adder you know Besides besides what
is all this meek talk I detest meek talkgods or men Surely in the
first and last resort all we are is ourselves Something has happened
you are jangled shaken But to us believe me you are simply one of
fewer friendsand I think after struggling up Widderstone Lane hand in
hand with you in the dark I have a right to say friends than I could
count on one hand What are we all if we only realized it We talk of
dignity and propriety and we are like so many children playing
with knucklebones in a giants scullery Come along he will some
suppertime for us each in turnand how many even will so much as look
up from their play to wave us goodbye thats what I meanthe plot
of silence we are all in If only I had my brothers lucidity how much
better I would have said all this It is only believe me that I want
ever so much to help you if I mayeven at risk too she added
rather shakily of having that helpwellI know its little good

The lane had narrowed They had climbed the arch of a narrow stone
bridge that spanned the smooth dark Widder A few late starlings were
winging far above them Darkness was coming on apace They stood for
awhile looking down into the black flowing water with here and there
the mild silver of a star dim leagues below I am afraid said
Grisel looking quietly up you have led me into talking most pitiless
nonsense How many hours I wonder did I lie awake in the dark last
night thinking of you Honestly I shall never NEVER forget that walk
It haunted me on and on

Thinking of me Do you really mean that Then it was not all
imagination it wasnt just the drowning man clutching at a straw

The grey eyes questioned him You see he explained in a whisper as
if afraid of being overheard itit came back again andI dont mind
a bit how much you laugh at me I had been asleep and had had a most
awful dream one of those dreams that seem to hint that some day THAT
will be our real world that some day we may awake where dreaming then
will be of this and I wokecame backand there was a tremendous
knocking going on downstairs I knew there was no one else in the
house

No one else in the house And you like this

Yes said Lawford stolidly they were all out as it happened And
of course he went on quickly there was nothing for me to do but
simply to go down and open the door And yet do you know at first I
simply couldnt move I lit a candle and thenthen somehow I got
to know that waiting for me was justbut there he broke off
halfashamed I mustnt bother you with all this morbid stuff Will
your brother be in now do you think

My brother will be in and of course expecting you But as for
bother believe mewell did I quite deserve it She stooped towards
him You lit a candleand then

They turned and retraced their way slowly up the hill

It came again

It

Thatthat presence that shadow I dont mean of course its a real
shadow It comes doesnt it fromfrom within As if from out of some
unheardof hiding place where it has been lurking for ages and ages
before ones childhood at least so it seems to me now And yet
although it does come from within there it is too in front of you
before your eyes feeding even on your fear just watching waiting
forWhat nonsense all this must seem to you

Yes yes and then

Then and you must remember the poor old boy had been knocking all this
timemy old friendMr Bethany I meanknocking and calling through
the letterbox thinking I was in extremis or something thenhow
shall I describe itwell YOU came your eyes your face as clear as
when you know the night before last we went up the hill together And
then

And then

And then weyou and I you knowsimply drove him downstairs and
I could hear myself grunting as if it was really a physical effort we
drove him step by step downstairs And He laughed outright and
boyishly continued his adventure What do you think I did then without
the ghost of a smile too at the idiocy of the thing I locked the poor
beggar in the drawingroom I saw him there as plainly as I ever saw
anything in my life and the furniture glimmering though it was pitch
dark I cant describe it It all seemed so desperately real absolutely
vital then It all seems so meaningless and impossible now And yet
although I am utterly played out and done for and however absurd it may
sound I wouldnt have lost it I wouldnt go back for any bribe there
is I feel just as if a great bundle had been rolled off my back Of
course the queerest the most detestable part of the whole business
is that itthe thing on the stairswas thishe lifted a grave and
haggard face towards her againor rather that he pointed with his
stick towards the starry churchyard Sabathier he said

Again they had paused together before the white gate and this time
Lawford pushed it open and followed his companion up the narrow path

She stayed a moment her hand on the bell Was it my brother who
actually put that horrible idea into your mindabout Sabathier

Oh no not really put it into my head said Lawford hollowly He only
found it there lit it up

She laid her hand lightly on his arm Whether he did or not she said
with an earnestness that was almost an entreaty of course you MUST
agree that we every one of us have some such experiencethat kind
of visitor once at least in a lifetime Ah but began Lawford
turning forlornly away you didnt see you cant have realizedthe
change

She pulled the bell almost as if in some inward triumph But dont you
think she suggested that that like the other might be as it were
partly imagination too If now you thought back

But a little old woman had opened the door and the sentence for the
moment was left unfinished



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

There was no one in the room and no light when they entered For a
moment Grisel stood by the open window looking out Then she turned
impulsively My brother of course will ask you too she said we
had made up our minds to do so if you came again but I want you to
promise me now that you wont dream of going back tonight That surely
would be temptingwell not Providence I couldnt rest if I thought
you might be alone like that again Her voice died away into the
calling of the waters A light moved across the dingy old rows of books
and as his sister turned to go out Herbert appeared in the doorway
carrying a greenshaded lamp with an old leather quarto under his arm

Ah here you are he said I guessed you had probably met He drew
up burdened before his visitor But his clear black glance instead of
wandering off at his first greeting had intensified And it was almost
with an air of absorption that he turned away He dumped his book on to
a chair and it turned over with scattered leaves on to the floor He
put the lamp down and stooped after it so that his next words came up
muffled and as if the remark had been forced out of him You dont
feel worse I hope He got up and faced his visitor for the answer And
for the moment Lawford stood considering his symptoms

No he said almost gaily I feel enormously better But Herberts
long oval questioning eyes beneath the sleek black hair were still
fixed on his face I am afraid my dear fellow he said with
something more than his usual curiously indifferent courtesy the
struggle has frightfully pulled you to pieces

The question is answered Lawford with a kind of tired yet whimsical
melancholy in his voice though I am not sure that the answer very much
matterswhats going to put me together again Its the old story of
Humpty Dumpty Herbert Besides one thing you said has stuck out in a
quite curious way in my memory I wonder if you will remember

What was that said Herbert with unfeigned curiosity

Why you said even though Sabathier had failed though I was still
my own old stodgy self that you thought the facethe face you know
might work in Somehow sometimes I think it has It does really rather
haunt me In that casewell what then Lawford had himself listened
to this involved explanation much as one watches the accomplishment of
a difficult trick marvelling more at its completion at all than at the
difficulty involved in the doing of it

Work in repeated Herbert like a rather blase child confronted with
a new mechanical toy did I really say that well honestly it wasnt
bad its what one would expect on that hypothesis You see we are
only different as it were in our differences Once the foots over the
threshold its nine points of the law But I dont remember saying it
He shamefacedly and naively confessed it I say such an awful lot of
things And Im always changing my mind Its a standing joke against me
with my sister She says the recording angel will have two sides to my
account Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and Tuesdays Thursdays and
Saturdaysdiametrically opposite convictions and both kinds wrong On
Sundays I am all things to all men As for Sabathier by the way I
do want particularly to have another go at him Ive been thinking him
over and Im afraid in some ways he wont quite wash And that reminds
me did you read the poor chap

I just grubbed through a page or two but most of my French was left at
school What I did do though was to show the book to an old friend
of oursmy wifes and minejust to skima Mr Bethany Hes an old
clergymanour vicar in fact

Herbert had sat down and with eyes slightly narrowed was listening with
peculiar attention He smiled a little magnanimously His verdict I
should think must have been a perfect joy

He said said Lawford in his rather low monotonous voice he said
it was precious poor stuff that it reminded him of patchouli and that
Sabathierthe print I meanlooked like a foxy old roue They were I
think his exact words We were alone together last night

You dont mean that he simply didnt see the faintest resemblance

Lawford nodded But then he added simply whenever he comes to see
me now he leaves his spectacles at home

And at that as if at some preconcerted signal they both went off into
a simple shout of laughter unanimous and sustained

But this first wild bout of laughter over the first real bursting of
the dam perhaps for years Lawford found himself at a lower ebb than
ever

You see he said presently and while still his companions face was
smiling around the remembrance of his laughter like ripples after the
splash of a stone Bethany has been absolutely my sheetanchor right
through And I wasit wasyou cant possibly realise what a ghastly
change it really was I dont think any one ever will

Herbert opened his hand and looked reflectively into its palm before
allowing himself to reply I wonder you know I have been wondering a
good deal simply taking the other point of view for a moment WAS it
I dont mean ghastly exactly like say smallpox GPI
elephantiasis but was it quite so complete so radical as in the
first sheer gust of astonishment you fancied

Lawford thought on a little further You know how one sees oneself in
a passionwhy how a child looksthe whole face darkened and drawn and
possessed That was the change Thats how it seems to come back to me
And something somebody dodging behind the eyes Yes more that than
even any excessive change of feature except of course that I also
seemedShall I ever forget that first cold stifling stare into the
lookingglass I certainly was much darker even my hair But Ive told
you all this before he added wearily and the scores and scores of
times Ive thought it I used to sit up there in the big spare bedroom
my wife put me up in simply gloating My flesh seemed nothing more
than an hallucination there I was haunting my body an old grinning
tenement and all that I thought I wanted and couldnt do without all
I valued and prided myself onstacked up in the drizzling street below
Why Herbert our bodies are only glass or cloud They melt dont they
like wax in the sun once were out But those first few days dont make
very pleasant thinking Friday night was the first when I sat there
like a twitching waxwork soberly debating between Bedlam here and
Bedlam hereafter I even sometimes wonder whether its very repetition
has not dulled the memory or distorted it My wife he added
ingenuously seems to think there are signs of a slight improvementa
going back I mean But Im not sure whether she meant it

Herbert surveyed his visitor critically You say dark he said but
surely Lawford your hair now is nearly grey wellflecked at least

Although the remark carried nothing comparatively of a shock with it
yet it seemed to Lawford as if an electric current had passed over his
scalp coldly stirring every hair upon his head But somehow or other it
was easier to sit quietly on to express no surprise to let them do or
say what they liked Well he retorted with an odd crooked smile you
must remember I am a good deal older than I was last Saturday I grew
grey in the grave Herbert

But its like this you know said Herbert rising excitedly and at
the next moment on reflection composedly reseating himself How many
of your people actually saw it How many owned to its being as bad as
complete as you made out I dont want for a moment to cut right across
what you said last nightour talkbut there are two million sides
to every question and as often as not the less conspicuous have
sounderwellroots Thats all

I think really do you know I would rather not go over the detestable
thing again Not many my wife though and a man I know called Danton
whowhos prejudiced After all I have myself to think about too And
right through right throughthere wasnt the least doubt of thatthey
all in their hearts knew it was me They knew I was behind I could feel
that absolutely always its not just eyes and ears we use theres us
ourselves to consider though God alone knows what that means But
the password was there as you might say and they all knew I knew it
allexcepthe looked up as if in bewildermentexcept just one a
poor old lady a very old friend of my mothers whom II Sabathiered

WhomyouSabathiered repeated Herbert carefully with infinite
relish looking sidelong at his visitor And it is just precisely
that

But at that moment his sister appeared in the doorway to say that supper
was ready And it was not until Herbert was actually engaged in carving
a cold chicken that he followed up his advantage Mr Lawford Grisel
he said has just enriched our jaded language with a new verbto
Sabathier And if I may venture to define it in the presence of
the distinguished neologist himself it means To deal with
histrionically or rather thats what it will mean a couple of
hundred years hence For the moment it means To act under the
influence of subliminalization To perplex or bemuse or estrange
with OTHERNESS Do tell us Lawford more about the little old lady
He passed with her plate a little meaningful glance at his sister and
repeated Do

But Ive been plaguing your sister enough already Youll wish
Lawford began and turned his tiredout eyes towards those others
awaiting them so frankly they seemed in their perfect friendliness
a rest from all his troubles You see he went on what I kept on
thinking and thinking of was to get a quite unbiased and unprejudiced
view She had known me for years though we had not actually met more
than once or twice since my mothers death And there she was sitting
with me at the other end of just such another little seat ashe
turnedto Herbert as ours at Widderstone It was on Bewley Common I
can see it all now it was sunset And I simply turned and asked her in
a kind of a whining affected manner if she remembered me and when after
a long time she came round to owning that to all intents and purposes
she did notI professed to have made a mistake in recognising her I
think he added glancing up from one to the other of his two strange
friends I think it was the meanest trick I can remember

Hm said Herbert solemnly I wish I had as sensitive a conscience
But as your old friend didnt recognise you whos the worse As for her
not doing so just think of the difference a few years makes to a man
and any severe shock Life wears so infernally badly Who for that
matter does not change even in character and yet who professes to see
it Mind I dont say in essence But then how many of the human ghosts
one meets does one know in essence One doesnt want to It would
be positively cataclysmic And thats what brings me around to feel
Lawford if I may venture to say so that you may have brooded a little
too keenly onon your own case Tell any one you feel ill he will
commiserate with you to positive nausea Tell any priest your soul is
in danger will he wait for proof Its misereres and penances world
without end Tell any woman you love her will she can she should she
gainsay you There you are The cats out of the bag you see My sister
and I sat up half the night talking the thing over I said Id take the
plunge I said Id risk appearing the crassest contradictoriest wretch
that ever drew breath I dont deny that what I hinted at the other
night must seem in part directly contrary to what Im going to say now

He wheeled his black eyes as if for inspiration and helped himself to
salad Its this he said Isnt it possible isnt it even probable
that being ill and overstrung moping a little over things more or less
out of the common ruck and sitting there in a kind of tranceisnt it
possible that you may have very largely IMAGINED the change Hypnotised
yourself into believing it much worsemore profound radical
acuteand simply absolutely hypnotizing others into thinking so too
Christendom is just beginning to rediscover that there is such a thing
as faith that it is just possible that say megrims or melancholia may
be removed at least as easily as mountains The converse of course
is obvious on the face of it A man fails because he thinks himself a
failure Its the men that run away that lose the battle Suppose then
Lawfordhe leaned forward keen and suavesuppose you have been and
Sabathiered yourself

Lawford had grown accustomed during the last few days to finding himself
gazing out like a child into reality as if from the windows of a dream
He had in a sense followed this long loosely stitched preliminary
argument he had at least in part realised that he sat there between
two clear friendly minds acting in the friendliest and most obvious
collusion But he was incapable of fixing his attention very closely
on any single fragment of Herberts apology or of rousing himself into
being much more than a dispassionate and not very interested spectator
of the little melodrama that Fate it appeared had at the last moment
decided rather capriciously to twist into a farce He turned with a
smile to the face so keenly fixed and enthusiastic with the question it
had so laboriously led up to But surely I dont quite see

Herbert lifted his glass as if to his visitors acumen and set it down
again without tasting it Why my dear fellow he said triumphantly
even a dream must have a peg Yours was this unforgettable old suicide
Candidly now how much of Sabathier was actually yours In spite of all
that that fantastical fellow Herbert said last night dead men DONT
tell tales The last place in the world to look for a ghost is where
his traitorous bones lie crumbling Good heavens think what irrefutable
masses of evidence there would be at our fingertips if every tombstone
hid its ghost No the fellow just arrested you with his creepy
epitaph an epitaph mind you that is in a literary sense distinctly
fertilizing It catches ones fancy in its own crude way as pages
and pages of infinitely more complicated stuff take possession of
germinate and sprout in ones imagination in another way We are all
psychical parasites Why given his epitaph given the surroundings I
wager any sensitive consciousness could have guessed at his face and
guessing as it were would have feigned it What do you think Grisel

I think dear you are talking absolute nonsense what do they call
itdarkening counsel Its the hair of the dog Mr Lawford

Well then you see said Herbert over a hasty mouthful and turning
again to his victimthen you see when you were just in the pink of
condition to credit any idle tale you heard then I came in What with
the least impetus can one NOT see by moonlight The howl of a dog turns
the midnight into a Brocken the branch of a tree stoops out at you like
a Beelzebub crusted with gadflies Id mind you sipped of the deadly
old Huguenot too Id listened to your innocent prattle about the child
kicking his toes out on deaths cupboard door what more likely thing in
the world then than that with that moon in that packed air I should
have swallowed the bait whole and seen Sabathier in every crevice of
your skin I dont say there wasnt any resemblance it was for the
moment extraordinary it was even when you were here the other night
distinctly arresting But now poor old Grisel Im nearly done all I
want to say is this that if we had the foxy old roue here now and
Grisel played Paris between the three of us shed hand over the apple
not to you but to me

I dont quite see where poor Paris comes in suggested Grisel meekly

No nor do I said Herbert All that I mean sagacious child is
that Mr Lawford no more resembles the poor wretch now than I resemble
the Apollo Belvedere If you had only heard my sister scolding me
railing at me for putting such ideas into your jangled head They
dont affect ME one iota I have I suppose what is usually called
imagination which merely means that I can sup with the devil spoon
for spoon and could sleep in Bluebeards linencloset without turning
a hair You if I am not very much mistaken are not much troubled with
that very unprofitable quality and so I suppose when a crooked and
bizarre fancy does edge into your mind it roots there

And that said not without some little confusion and covert glance of
inquiry at his sister Herbert made all the haste he could to catch up
the course that his companions had already finished

If only Lawford thought this insufferable weariness would lift awhile
he could enjoy the quiet absurd heedless talk and this very friendly
topsyturvy effort to ease his mind and soothe his nerves He might even
take an interest again in his case

You see he said turning to Grisel I dont think it really very
much matters how it all came about I never could believe it would last
It may perhapssome of it at least may be fancy But then what isnt
What is trustworthy And now your brother tells me my hairs turning
grey I suppose I have been living too slowly too sluggishly and they
thought it was high time to stir me up

He saw with extraordinary vividness the low panelled room the still
listening face the white muslin shoulders and dark hair and the
eyes that seemed to recall some faroff desolate longing for home and
childhood It was all a dream That was the end of the matter Even now
perhaps his tired old stupid body was lying hunched up drenched with
dew upon the little old seat under the mistwreathed branches Soon it
would bestir itself and wake up and go off homehome to Sheila to the
old deadly round that once had seemed so natural and inevitable to the
old dull Lawfordeyes and brain and heart

They returned up the dark shallow staircase to Herberts bookroom and
he talked on to very quiet and passive listeners in his own fantastic
endless fashion And ever and again Lawford would find himself
intercepting fleeting and anxious glances at his face glances almost
of remorse and pity and thought he detected beneath this irresponsible
contradictory babble an unceasing effort to clear the sky to lure away
too pressing memories to put his doubts and fears completely to rest

Herbert even went so far as to plead guilty when Grisel gave him the
cue of having a little heightened and overcoloured his story of
the restless phantasmal old creature that haunted their queer wooden
hauntable old house And when they rose laughing and yawning to take
up their candles it was after all after a rather animated discussion
with many a hairraising ghost story brought in for proof between
brother and sister as to exactly how many times that snuffcoloured
spectre had made his appearance and with less unanimity still as
to the precise manner in which he was in the habit of making his
precipitant exit

You do at any rate acknowledge Grisel that the old creature does
appear and that you saw him yourself step out into space when you were
sitting down there under the willow shelling peas Ive seen him twice
for certain once rather hazily Sallie saw him so plainly she asked his
business thats five I resign

Acknowledge said Grisel of course I do Id acknowledge anything in
the world to save argument Why I dont know what I should do without
him If only now Mr Lawford would give him a fair chance to show
himself reading quietly here about ten minutes to one or shelling peas
even if he prefers it If only hed stay long enough for THAT Wouldnt
it be the very thing for them both

Of course said Herbert cordially the very thing

Lawford looked up at neither of them He shook his head

But he needed little persuasion to stay at least one night The prospect
of that long solitary walk of that tired stupid stooping figure
dragging itself along the interminable country roads seemed a sheer
impossibility It is notit isnt I swear itthe other that beeps me
back he had solemnly assured the friend that half smiled her relief at
his acceptance butif you only knew how empty its all got now all
reason gone even to go on at all

But doesnt it follow Of course its empty And now life is going
to begin again I assure you it is I do indeed Only only have
couragejust the will to win on

He said goodnight shutto the latched door of his long low room
ceilinged with rafters close under the steep roof its brown walls hung
with quiet dark pondering and beautiful faces looking gravely across
at him And with his candle in his hand he sat down on the bedside All
speculation was gone The noisy clock of his brain had run down again
He turned towards the old oval lookingglass on the dressingtable
without the faintest stirring of interest suspense or anxiety What
did it matter what a man looked likea now familiar but enfeebled and
deprecating voice seemed to say He knew that a change had come Even
Sheila had noticed it And since then what had he not gone through What
now was here seemed of little moment so far at least as this world was
concerned

At last with an effort he rose crossed the uneven floor and looked in
unmovedly on what was his own poor face come back to him changed indeed
almost beyond belief from the sleek selfsatisfied genial yet languid
Arthur Lawford of the past years and still haunted with some faint
trace of the set and icy sharpness and challenge and affront of the
dark Adventurer but thathow immeasurably dimmed and blunted and
faded He had expected to find it so Would it the thought vanished
across his mind would it have been as unmistakably there had he
come hotfoot fearing expecting to find the other Butwas he
disappointed

He hardly knew how long he stood there leaning on his hands surveying
almost listlessly in the candlelight that lined bedraggled grey
hopeless countenance those darksocketed smouldering eyes whose
pupils even now were so dilated that a casual glance would have failed
to detect the least hint of any iris It must have been something
pretty bad you were you know or something pretty bad you did they
seemed to be trying to say to him to drag us down to this

He knelt down by force of habit to say his prayers but no words came
Well between earthly friends a betrayal such as this would have caused
a livelong estrangement and hostility The God the old Lawford used to
pray to would forgive him he thought wearily if just for the present
he was a little too sore at heart to play the hypocrite But if
while kneeling he said nothing he saw a good many things in such
tranquillity and clearness as the mere eyes of the body can share but
rarely with their sisters of the imagination And now it was Alice
who looked mournfully out of the dark at him and now the little old
charwoman Mrs Gull with her bag hooked over her arm climbed painfully
up the area steps and now it was the lean vexed face of a friend
nursing some restless and anxious grievance against himMr Bethany
and then and ever again it was the face of one who seemed pure dream and
fantasy and yet He listened intently and fancied even now he could
hear the voices of brother and sister talking quietly and circumspectly
together in the room beneath



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

A quiet knocking aroused him in the long tranquil bedroom and
Herberts head was poked into the room Theres a bath behind that door
over there he whispered or if you like Im off for a bathe in the
Widder Its a luscious day Shall I wait All right and the head was
withdrawn Dont put much on came the voice at the panel well be
home again in twenty minutes

The green and brightness of the morning must have been prepared for
overnight by spiders and the dew Everywhere the gleaming nets were
hung and everywhere there rose a tiny splendour from the waterdrops so
clear and pure and changeable it seemed with their fire and colour
they shook a tiny crystal music in the air Herbert led the way along a
clayey downward path beneath hazels tossing softly together their twigs
of nuts until they came out into a rounded hollow that mounded with
thyme sloped gently down to the green banks of the Widder The water
poured like clearest glass beneath a rain of misty sunbeams

My sister always says that this is the very dell Boccaccio had in his
minds eye when he wrote the Decameron There really is something
almost classic in those pines And Id sometimes swear with my eyes just
out of the water Ive seen Dryads half in hiding peeping between those
beeches Good Lord Lawford what a world we wretched moderns have made
and missed

The water was violently cold It seemed to Lawford as it swept up over
his body and as he plunged his nightdistorted eyes beneath its blazing
surface that it was charged with some strange powerful enchantment to
wash away in its icy clearness even the memory of the dull and tarnished
days behind him If one could but tie up anyhow that stained bundle of
inconsequent memories called life and fling it into a cupboard remoter
even than Bluebeards and lock the door and drop the quicklyrusting
key into these living waters

He dressed himself with window thrown open to the blackbirds and
thrushes and the occasional shrill solitary whistling of a robin But
like the soursweet fragrance of the brier its wandering desolate burst
of music had power to wake memory and carried him instantly back to
that first aimless descent into the evening gloom of Widderstone from
which it was in vain to hope ever to climb again Surely never a more
ghoulish face looked out on its man before than that which confronted
him as with borrowed razor he stood shaving those sunken chaps that
angular chin

And even now beneath the lantern of broad daylight just as within that
other face had lurked the undeniable ghost and presence of himself so
beneath the sunken features seemed to float tenuous as smoke scarcely
less elusive than a dream between eye and object the sinister darkness
of the face that in those two bouts with fear he had by some strange
miracle managed to repel

Work in the chance phrase came back It had worked in in sober
earnest and so far as the living of the next few weeks went surely it
might prove an ally without which he simply could not conceive himself
as struggling on at all

But as dexterous minds as even restless Sabathiers had him just now in
safe and kindly keeping All the quiet October morning Herbert kept him
talking and stooping over his extraordinary collection of books

The point is he explained to Lawford standing amid a positive
archipelago of precious finds with his foot hoisted onto a chair and
a patchedup seastained folio on his knee I honestly detest the mere
give and take of what we are fools enough to call life I dont deny
Lifes there he swept his hand towards the open windowin that
frantic Tophet we call London but theres no focus no point of
vantage Even a scribbler only gets it piecemeal and through a dulled
medium We learn to read before we know how to see we swallow our
tastes convictions and emotions whole so that ninetenths of the
worlds nectar is merely honeydew He smiled pleasantly into the
fixed vacancy of his visitors face Thats why Ive just gone on he
continued amiably collecting this particular kind of stuffwhat you
might call riffraff Theres not a book here Lawford that hasnt
at least a glimmer of the real thing in itjust Life seen through
a living eye and felt As for literature and style and all that
gallimaufry dont fear for them if your author has the ghost of a hint
of genius in his making

But surely said Lawford trying for the twentieth time to pretend
to himself that these endless books carried the faintest savour of the
delight to him which they must he rather forlornly supposed shower
upon Herbert surely genius is a very rare thing

Rare the world simply swarms with it But before you can bottle it up
in a book its got to be articulate Just for a single instant imagine
yourself Falstaff and if there werent hundreds of Falstaffs in every
generation to be examples of his ungodly life hed be as dead as a
doornail tomorrowimagine yourself Falstaff and being so
sitting down to write Henry IV or The Merry Wives Its simply
preposterous You wouldnt be such a fool as to waste the time A mere
Elizabethan scribbler comes along with a gift of expression and an
observant eye lifts the bloated old tippler clean out of life and
swims down the ages as the greatest genius the world has ever seen
Whereas surely though you mustnt let me bore you with all this
piffle its Falstaff is the genius and W S merely a talented
reporter

Lear Macbeth Mercutiothey live on their own as it were The
newspapers are full of them if we were only the Shakespeares to see it
Have you ever been in a Police Court Have you ever WATCHED tradesmen
behind their counters My soul the secrets walking in the streets You
jostle them at every corner Theres a Polonius in every firstclass
railway carriage and as many Juliets as there are boardingschools
What the devil are you my dear chap but genius itself with all the
world brand new upon your shoulders And whod have thought it of you
ten days ago

Its simply and solely because were all poor wretches dumbdumb as
butts of Malmsez dumb as drummerless drums Here am I ass that I am
trickling out thisthis whey that no more expresses me than Tupper
does Sappho But thats what I want to mean How inexhaustibly rich
everything is if you only stick to life Here it is packed away behind
these rotting covers just the real thing no respectable stodge no
mere parasitic stuff not more than a dozen poets scores of outcasts
and vagabondsand the real thing in vagabonds is pretty rare in print
I can tell you Were all every one of us sodden with facts drugged
with the secondhand and barnacled with respectability untiluntil the
touch comes Goodness knows where from but theres no mistaking it oh
no

But what said Lawford uneasily what on earth do you mean by the
touch

I mean when you cease to be a puppet only and sit up in the gallery
too When you squeeze through to the other side When you suffer a kind
of conversion of the mind become aware of your senses When you get a
living inkling When you become articulate to yourself When you SEE

I am awfully stupid Lawford murmured but even now I dont really
follow you a bit But when as you say you do become articulate to
yourself what happens then

Why then said Herbert with a shrug almost of despair then
begins the weary tramp back One by one drop off the truisms and the
Grundyisms and the pedantries and all the stillborn claptrap of the
marketplace sloughs off Then one can seriously begin to think about
saving ones soul

Saving ones soul groaned Lawford why I am not even sure of my own
body yet He walked slowly over to the window and with every thought in
his head as quiet as doves on a sunny wall stared out into the garden
of green things growing leaves fading and falling water I tell you
what he said turning irresolutely I wonder if you could possibly
find time to write me out a translation of Sabathier My French is much
too hazy to let me really get at the chap Hes gone now but I really
should like to know what kind of stuff exactly he has left behind

Oh Sabathier said Herbert laughing What do you think of that
Grisel he asked turning to his sister who at that moment had looked
in at the door Heres Mr Lawford asking me to make a translation of
Sabathier Lunch Lawford

Lawford sighed And not until he had slowly descended half the narrow
uneven stairs that led down to the diningroom did he fully realise the
guile of a sister that could induce a hopeless bookworm to waste a whole
morning over the stupidest of companions simply to keep his tiredout
mind from rankling and give his Sabathier a chance to go to roost

I think do you know he managed to blurt out at last I think I ought
to be getting home again The house is emptyand

You shall go this evening said Herbert if you really must insist
on it But honestly Lawford we both think that after what the last few
days must have been it is merely common sense to take a rest How can
you possibly rest with a dozen empty rooms echoing every thought you
think Theres nothing more to worry about you agree to that Send
your people a note saying that you are here safe and sound Give them a
chance of lighting a fire and driving in the fatted calf Stay on with
us just the week out

Lawford turned from one to the other of the two friendly faces But what
was dimly in his mind refused to express itself I think you know
I he began falteringly

But its just this thinking thats the deucethis preposterous habit
of having continually to make up ones mind Off with his head Grisel
My sisters going to take you for a picnic we go every other fine
afternoon and you can argue it out with her

Once alone again with Grisel however Lawford found talking
unnecessary Silences seemed to fall between them as quietly and
restfully as evening flows into night They walked on slowly through the
fading woods and when they had reached the top of the hill that sloped
down to the dark and foamless Widder they sat down in the honeyscented
sunshine on a knoll of heather and bracken and Grisel lighted the
little spiritkettle she had brought with her and busied herself very
methodically over making tea

That done she clasped her hands round her knees and sat now gossiping
now silent in the pale autumnal beauty There was a bird wistfully
twittering in the branches overhead and ever and again a withered leaf
would slip circling down from the motionless beech boughs arched in
their stillness above their heads beneath the thin blue sky

Men you know she began again suddenly starting out of reverie
really are absurdly blind and just a little bit absurdly kindly
stupid How many times have I been at the point of laughing out at my
brothers delicious naive subtleties But you do you will understand
Mr Lawford that he was that we are both doing our bestto make
amends


I understandI do indeeda tenth part of all your kindness

Yes but thats just itthat horrible word kindness If ever there
were two utterly selfabsorbed people without a trace with an absolute
horror of kindness it is just my brother and I Its most of it false
and most of it useless We all surely must take what comes in this
topsyturvy world I believe in saying outthat the more one thinks
about life the worse it becomes There are only two kinds of happiness
in this worlda wooden posts and Prometheuss And who ever heard
of any one having the impudence to be kind to Prometheus As for a
miserable medium like me not quite a post and leagues and leagues
from even envying a Prometheus shes better for the powder without the
jam But thats all nothing What I cant help thinkingand its not a
bit giving my brother away because we both think itthat it was partly
our thoughtlessness that added at least something toto the rest It
was perfectly absurd He saw you were ill he sawhe must have seen
even in that first Sunday talkthat your nerves were all askew And
who doesnt know what nerves means nowadays And yet he deliberately
chattered He loves itjust at large you know like me I told him
before I came out that I intended if I could to say all this And now
its said youll please forgive me for going back to it

Please dont talk about forgiveness But when you say he chattered you
mean about Sabathier of course And that you know I dont care a fig
for now We can settle all that between ourselveshim and me I mean
And now tell me candidly againIs there any prey in my face now

She looked up fleetingly into his eyes leant back her head and laughed
Prey there never was a glimpse

And change Their eyes met again in an infinitely brief infinitely
bewildering argument

Really really scarcely perceptible she assured him except of
course how horribly horribly ill you look And that only seems to
prove to me you must be hiding something else No illusion on earth
couldcould have done that to your face

You think I know he persisted that I must be persuaded and
cosseted and humoured Yes you do its my poor old sanity thats
really in both your minds Perhaps I amnot absolutely sound Anyhow
Ive been watching it in your looks at each other all the time And I
can never never say never tell you what you have done for me But you
see after all we did win through I keep on telling myself that So
that now its purely from the most selfish and practical motives that I
want you to be perfectly frank with me I have to go back you know and
some of them one or two of my friends I mean are not all on my side
Think of me as I was when you came into the room three centuries ago
and you turned and looked frowning at me in the candlelight remember
that and look at me now What is the difference Does it shock you Does
it make the whole world seem a trick a sham Does it simply sour your
life to think such a thing possible Oh the hours Ive spent gloating
on Widderstones miserable mask of skin and bone as I was saying to
your brother only last night and never knew until they shuffled me that
the old self too was nothing better than a stifling suffocating mask

But dont you see she argued softly turning her face away a little
you were a stranger then though I certainly didnt mean to frown And
then a little while after we were well just human beings shoulder
to shoulder and if friendship does not mean that I dont know what it
does mean And now you arewell just you the you you know of three
centuries ago And if you mean to ask me whether at any precise moment
I have been conscious that this you I am now speaking to was not the
you of last night or of that dark climb up the hill why it is simply
frantic to think it could ever be necessary to say over and over again
No But if you mean Have you changed else All I could answer is Dont
we all change as we grow to know one another What were just features
what just dingily represented one as it were is forgotten or rather
gets remembered Of course the first glimpse is the landscape under
lightning as it were But afterwards isnt it surely like the alphabet
to a child what was first a queer angular scrawl becomes A and is
always ever after A undistinguished halfforgotten yet standing at
last for goodness knows what real wonderful thingsor for just the dry
bones of soulless words Is that it She stole a sidelong glance into
his brooding face leaning her head on her hand

Yes yes came the rather dissatisfied reply I do agree perfectly
But then you seeI told you I was going to talk of nothing but
myselfwhat did at first happen to me was something much worse and I
suppose something quite different from that

And yet didnt you tell us that of all your friends not one really
denied in their hearts yourwhat they would call I supposeyour
IDENTITY except that poor little offended old lady And even she if my
intuition is worth a penny piece even she when you go soon and talk to
her will own that she did know you and that it was not because you
were a stranger that she was offended but because you so ungenerously
pretended to be one That was a little mad now if you like

Oh yes said Lawford I am going to ask her forgiveness I dont know
what I didnt vow to take her for a peaceoffering if the chance should
ever comeand the courageto make my peace with her But now that the
chance has come and I think the courage it is the desire thats gone
I dont seem to care either way I feel as if I had got past making my
peace with any one

But this time no answer helped him out

After all he went plodding on there is more than just the mere day
to day to consider And one doesnt realise that ones face actually
IS ones fortune without a shock And that THAT gone one is as
your brother said just like a bee come back to the wrong hive It
undermines he smiled rather bitterly ones views rather And it
certainly shifts ones friends If it hadnt been just for my oldhe
stopped dead and again pushed slowly onif it hadnt been for our
old friend Mr Bethany I doubt if we should now have had a soul on our
side I once read somewhere that wolves always chase the old and weak
and maimed out of the pack And after all what do we do Where do
we keep the homeless and the insane And yet you know he added
ruminatingly it is not as if mine was ever a particularly lovely or
lovable face While as for the poor wretch behind it well I really
cannot see what meaning or life even he had before

Before

Lawford met bravely the clear whimsical eyes Before I was
Sabathiered

Grisel laughed outright

You think he retorted almost bitterly you think I am talking like a
child

Yes she sighed cheerfully I was quite envying you

Well there I am said Lawford inconsequently And now well now
I suppose the whole things to begin again I cant help beginning to
wonder what the meaning of it all is why ones duty should always seem
so very stupid a thing And then too what can there be on earth
that even a buried Sabathier could desire He glanced up in a really
animated perplexity at the still dark face turned in the evening light
towards the darkening valley And perplexity deepened into a disquieted
frownlike that of a child who is roused suddenly from a daydream by
the halfforgotten question of a stranger He turned his eyes almost
furtively away as if afraid of disturbing her and for awhile they sat
in silence At last he turned again almost shyly I hope some day you
will let me bring my daughter to see you

Yes yes said Grisel eagerly we should both LOVE it of course
Isnt it curiousI simply KNEW you had a daughter Sheer intuition

I say some day said Lawford I know though that that some day
will never come

Wait just wait replied the quiet confident voice that will come
too One thing at a time Mr Lawford Youve won your old self back
again youll win your old love of life back again in a little while
never fear Oh dont I know that awful Lands End after illness and
that longing too that gnawing longing too for Ultima Thule So
its a bargain between us that you bring your daughter soon She busied
herself over the tea things And of course she added as if it were
an afterthought looking across at him in the pale green sunlight as she
knelt you simply wont think of going back tonight Solitude I
really do think solitude just now would be absolute madness Youll
write today and go perhaps tomorrow

Lawford looked across in his mind at his square ungainly house
fullfronting the afternoon sun He tried to repress a shudder I
think do you know I ought to go today

Well why not Why not Just to reassure yourself that alls well And
come back here to sleep If youd really promise that Id drive you in
Id love it Theres the jolliest little governesscart we sometimes
hire for our picnics Way I Youve no idea how much easier in our minds
my brother and I would be if you would And then tomorrow or at any
rate the next day you shall be surrendered whole and in your right
mind There thats a bargain too Now we must hurry



CHAPTER NINETEEN

Herbert himself went down to order the governess cart and packed them
in with a rug And in the dusk Grisel set Lawford down at the corner of
his road and drove on to an old booksellers with a commission from her
brother promising to return for him in an hour Dust and a few straws
lay at rest as if in some abstruse arrangement on the stones of the
porch just as the last faint whirling gust of sunset had left them Shut
lids of sightless indifference seemed to greet the wanderer from the
curtained windows

He opened the door and went in For a moment he stood in the vacant
hall then he peeped first into the blinddrawn diningroom faintly
dingily sweet like an empty winebottle He went softly on a few paces
and just opening the door looked in on the faintly glittering twilight
of the drawingroom But the congealed stump of candle that he had set
in the corner as a final rancorous challenge to the beaten Shade was
gone He slowly and deliberately ascended the stairs conscious of a
peculiar sense of ownership of what in even so brief an absence had
taken on so queer a look of strangeness It was almost as if he might be
some lone heir come in the rather mournful dusk to view what melancholy
fate had unexpectedly bestowed on him

Work inwhat on earth else could this chill sense of strangeness
mean Would he ever free his memory from that one haphazard haunting
hint And as he stood in the doorway of the big calm room which seemed
even now to be stirring with the restless shadow of these last few
faraway days now pacing sullenly to and fro now sitting hunchedup to
think and now lying impotent in a vain hopeless endeavour only for the
breath of a moment to forgethe awoke out of reverie to find himself
smiling at the thought that a changed face was practically at the mercy
of an incredulous world whereas a changed heart was no ones deadly
dull affair but its owners The merest breath of pity even stole over
him for the Sabathier who after all had dared and had needed perhaps
nothing like so arrogant and merciless a coup de grace to realise that
he had so ignominiously failed

But there thats done he exclaimed out loud not without a tinge of
regret that theories however brilliant and bizarre could never now be
anything elsethat now indeed that the symptoms had gone the malady
for all who had not been actually admitted into the shocked circle
was become nothing more than an inanely tall story stuffing not
even savoury enough for a goose How wide exactly he wondered would
Sheilas discreet shocked circle prove He stood once more before the
lookingglass hearing again Grisels words in the still green shadow
of the beechtree Except of course horribly horribly ill What a
fool what a coward she thinks I am

There was still nearly an hour to be spent in this great barn of faded
interests He lit a candle and descended into the kitchen A mouse went
scampering to its hole as he pushed open the door The memory of that
ravenous morning meal nauseated him It was sour and very still here
he stood erect the air smelt faint of earth In the breakfastroom the
bookcase still swung open Late evening mantled the garden and in
sheer ennui again he sat down to the table and turned for a last not
unfriendly hobanob with his poor old friend Sabathier He would take
the thing back Herbert of course was going to translate it for him
Now if the patient old Frenchman had stormed Herbert insteadthat
surely would have been something like a coup Those frenzied books
The absurd talk of the man Herbert was perfectly righthe could have
entertained fifty old Huguenots without turning a hair Im such an
awful stodge

He turned the woolly leaves over very slowly He frowned impatiently
and from the end backwards turned them over again Then he laid the book
softly down on the table and sat back He stared with narrowed lids
into the flame of his quiet friendly candle Every trace every shred of
portrait and memoir were gone Once more deliberately punctiliously
he examined page by page the blurred and unfamiliar Frenchthe sooty
heads the long lean noses the baggy eyes passing like figures in
a peepshow one by one under his handto the last fragmentary and
dexterously mended leaf Yes Sabathier was gone Quite the old slow
Lawford smile crept over his face at the discovery It was a smile a
little sheepish too as he thought of Sheilas quiet vigilance

And the next instant he had looked up sharply with a sudden peculiar
shrug and a kind of cry like the first thin cry of an awakened child
in his mind Without a moments hesitation he climbed swiftly upstairs
again to the big sepulchral bedroom He pressed with his fingernail the
tiny spring in the lookingglass The empty drawer flew open There were
fingermarks still in the dust

Yet strangely enough beneath all the clashing thoughts that came
flocking into his mind as he stood with the empty drawer in his hand
was a wounding yet still a little amused pity for his old friend Mr
Bethany So far as he himself was concerned the discoverywell he
would have plenty of time to consider everything that could possibly now
concern himself Anyhow it could only simplify matters

He remembered waking to that old wave of sickening horror on the first
unhappy morning he remembered the keen yet owlish old face blinking
its deathless friendliness at him and the steady pressure of the cold
skinny hand As for Sheila she had never done anything by halves
certainly not when it came to throwing over a friend no longer
necessary to ones social satisfaction But she would edge out cleverly
magnanimously triumphantly enough no doubt when the day of reckoning
should come the day when her nets wide spread her bait prepared he
must stand up before her outraged circle and positively prove himself
her lawful husband perhaps even to the very imprint of his thumb

Poor old thing he said again and this time his pity was shared
almost equally between both witnesses to Mr Bethanys ingenuous little
document the loss of which had fallen so softly and pathetically that
he felt only ashamed of having discovered it so soon

He shut back the telltale drawer and after trying to collect his
thoughts in case anything should have been forgotten he turned with a
deep trembling sigh to descend the stairs But on the landing he drew
back at the sound of voices and then a footstep Soon came the sound of
a key in the lock He blew out his candle and leant listening over the
balusters

Whos there he called quietly

Me sir came the feeble reply out of the darkness

What is it Ada What have you come for

Only sir to see that all was safe and you were in sir

Yes he said Alls safe and I am in What if I had been out It
was like dropping tiny pebbles into a deep wellso long after came the
answering feeble splash

Then I was to go back sir And a moment after the discreet voice
floated up with the faintest tinge of effrontery out of the hush Is
that Dr Ferguson too sir

No Ada and please tell your mistress from me that Dr Ferguson is
unlikely to call again A keen but rather forlorn smile passed over his
face Hes dining with friends no doubt at Holloway But of course if
she should want to see him he will see her tomorrow at any hour at Mrs
Lovats AndAda

Yes sir

Say that Im a little better your mistress will be relieved to hear
that Im a little better still not quite myself say but I think a
little better

Yes sir and Im sure Im very glad to hear it came fainter still

What voice was that I heard just now

Miss Alices sir but she came quite against my wishes and I hope you
wont repeat it sir She promised if she came that mistress shouldnt
know I was only afraid she might disturb you oror Dr Ferguson And
did you say sir that I was to tell mistress that he MIGHT be coming
back

Ah that I dont know so perhaps it would be as well not to mention
him at all Is Miss Alice there

I said I would tell her if you were alone But I hope youll understand
that it was only because she begged so Mistress has gone to St Peters
bazaar and thats how it was

I quite understand Beckon to her

There came a hasty step in the hall and a hurried murmur of explanation
Lawford heard her call as she ran up the stairs and the next moment
he had Alices hand in his and they were groping together through the
gloaming back into the solitude of the empty room again

Dont be alarmed dear he heard himself imploring Just hold tight
to that clear common sense and above all you wont tell It must be our
secret a dead dead secret from every one even your mother for just
a little while just a mere two days or soin case ImIm better
dear

He fumbled with the little box of matches dropped one broke another
but at last the candleflame dipped brightened and with the door shut
and the last pale blueness of dusk at the window Lawford turned and
looked at his daughter She stood with eyes wide open like the eyes
of a child walking in its sleep then twisted her fingers more tightly
within his Oh dearest how ill how ill you look she whispered
But there never mindnever mind It was all a miserable dream then
it wont it cant come back I dont think I could bear its coming
back And mother told me such curious things as if I were a child and
understood nothing And even after I knew that you were youI mean
before I sat up here in the dark to see youshe said that you were
gone and would never come back that a terrible thing had happeneda
disgrace which we must never speak of and that all the other was only
a pretence to keep people from talking But I did not believe then and
how could I believe afterwards

There never mind now dear what she said It was all meant for the
best perhaps But here I am and not nearly so ill as I look Alice
and theres nothing more to trouble ourselves about not even if it
should be necessary for me to go away for a time And this is our
secret mind ours only just a dead secret between you and me

They sat for awhile without speaking or stirring And faintly along the
hushed road Lawford heard in the silence a leisurely indolent beat of
little hoofs approaching and the sound of wheels A sudden wave of
feeling swept over him He took Alices quiet loving face in his hands
and kissed her passionately Do not so much as think of me yet or
doubt or question only love me dearest And soonand soon

Well just begin again just begin again wont we all three of us
together just as we used to be I didnt mean to have said all those
horrid things about mother She was only dreadfully anxious and meant
everything for the best Youll let me tell her soon

The haggard face turned slowly listening I hear I understand but
I cant think very clearly now Alice I cant dear my miserable old
tangled nerves I just stumble along as best I can Youll understand
better when you get to be a poor old thing like me We must do the best
we can And of course youll see Dillie how awfully important it is
not to raise false hopes You understand I mustnt risk the least thing
in the world must I And now goodbye only for a few hours now And not
a word not a word to a single living soul

He extinguished the candle again and led the way to the top of the
stairs Are you there Ada

Yes sir answered the quiet imperturbable voice from under the black
straw brim Alice went slowly down but at the foot of the stairs
looking out into the cold blue lamplit street she paused as if at a
sudden recollection and ran hastily up again

There was nothing more dear She said leaning back to peer up

Nothing more What

She stood panting a little in the darkness listening to some cautious
yet uneasy thought that seemed to haunt her mind I thoughtit seemed
there was something we had not said something I could not understand
But there it is nothing You know what a fanciful old silly I am You
do love me Quite as much as ever

More sweetheart more

Goodnight again then and God bless you dear

The outer door closed softly the footsteps died away Lawford still
hesitated He took hold of the stairs above his head as he stood on
the landing and leaned his head upon his hands striving calmly to
disentangle the perplexity of his thoughts His pulses were beating in
his ear with a low muffled roar He looked down between the blinds to
where against the blue of the road beneath the straggling yellow beams
of the lamp stood the little cart and drooping shaggy pony and Grisel
sitting quietly there awaiting him He shut his eyes as if in hope by
some convulsive effort of mind to break through this subtle glasslike
atmosphere of dream that had stolen over consciousness and blotted out
the significance almost the meaning of the past He turned abruptly
Empty as the empty rooms around him unanswering were mind and heart
Life was a tale told by an idiotsignifying nothing

He paused at the head of the staircase And even then the doubt
confronted him Would he ever come back Who knows he thought and
again stood pondering arguing denying At last he seemed to have come
to a decision He made his way downstairs opened and left ajar a long
narrow window in a passage to the garden beyond the kitchen He turned
on his heel as he reached the gate and waved his hand as if in a kind of
forlorn mockery towards the darkly glittering windows The drowsy pony
awoke at touch of the whip

Grisel lifted the rug and squeezed a little closer into the corner She
had drawn a veil over her face so that to Lawford her eyes seemed to
be dreaming in a little darkness of their own as he laid his hand on
the side of the cart Its a most curious thing he said but peeping
down at you just now when the sound of the wheels came a memory came
clearly back to me of years and years agoof my mother She used to
come to fetch me at school in a little cart like this and a little
pony just like this with a thick dusty coat And once I remember I was
simply sick of everything a failure and fagged out and all that and
was looking out in the twilight I fancy even it was autumn too It was
a little side staircase window I was horribly homesick And she came
quite unexpectedly I shall never forget itthe misery and then her
coming He lifted his eyes cowed with the incessant struggle and
watched her face for some time in silence Ought I to stay

I see no ought she said No one is there

Only a miserable broken voice out of a broken cagecalled Conscience

Dont you think perhaps that even that has a good many
disguisesconvention cowardice weakness ennui they all take their
turn at hooting in its feathers You must you really must have rest
You dont know you dont see I do Just a little snap some one last
exquisite thread gives way and then it is all over You see I have even
to try to frighten you for I cant tell you how you distress me

Why do I distress youmy face my story you mean

No I mean you your trouble that horrible empty house andoh dear
me yes your courage too

Listen said Lawford stooping forward He could scarcely see the
pale veiled face through this mist that had risen up over his eyes
I have no courage apart from you no courage and no hope Ask me to
comea stranger with no history no mockery no miserable rant of a
grave and darkness and fear behind me Are we not all hauntedevery
one That forgotten and the fool I was and the vacillating and the
pretenceoh how it all sweeps clear before me without a will without
a hope or glimpse or whisper of courage Be just the memory of my
mother the face the friend Ive never seen the voice that every dream
leaves echoing Ask me to come

She sat unstirring and then as if by some uncontrollable impulse
stooped a little closer to him and laid her gloved hand on his

I hear you know I hear too she whispered But we mustnt listen
Come now Its growing late

The little village echoed back from its stone walls the clatter of the
ponys hoofs Night had darkened to its deepest when their lamp shone
white on the wicket in the hedge They had scarcely spoken Lawford had
simply watched pass by almost without a thought the arching trees the
darkening fields had watched rise up in a mist of primrose light the
harvest moon to shine in saffron on the faces and shoulders of the few
wayfarers they met or who passed them by The still grave face beneath
the shadow of its veil had never turned though the moon poured all her
flood of brilliance upon the dark profile And once when as if in sudden
alarm he had lifted his head and looked at her a sudden doubt had
assailed him so instantly that he had half put out his hand to touch
her and had as quickly withdrawn it lest her beauty and stillness
should be even as the moments fancy had suggested only a fargone
memory returned in dream

Herbert hailed them from the darkness of an open window He came
down and they talked a little in the cold air of the garden He lit
a cigarette and climbed languidly into the cart and drove the drowsy
little pony off into the moonlight



CHAPTER TWENTY

It was a quiet supper the three friends sat down to Herbert sat
narrowing his eyes over his thoughts which when the fancy took him he
scattered out upon the others silence Lawford apparently had not yet
shaken himself free from the sorcery of the moonlight His eyes shone
dark and full like those of a child who has trespassed beyond its hour
for bed and sits marvelling at reality in a waking dream

Long after they had bidden each other goodnight long after Herbert
had trodden on tiptoe with his candle past his closed door Lawford
sat leaning on his arms at the open window staring out across the
motionless moonlit trees that seemed to stand like draped and dreaming
pilgrims come to the peace of their Nirvana at last beside the crashing
music of the waters And he himself the self that never sleeps beneath
the tides and waves of consciousness was listening too almost as
unmovedly and unheedingly to the thoughts that clashed in conflict
through his brain

Why in a strange transitory life was one the slave of these small
cares What if even in that dark pit beneath which seemed to whisper
Lethe to the tumultuous swirling waterswhat if there too were
merely a beginning again and to seek a slumbering refuge there merely a
blind and reiterated plunge into the heat and tumult of another day Who
was that poor dark homeless ghoul Sabathier Who was this Helen of an
impossible dream Her face with its strange smile her eyes with their
still pity and rapt courage had taken hope away Heres not your rest
cried one insistent voice she is the mystery that haunts day and
night past all the changing of the restless hours Chance has given you
back eyes to see a heart that can be broken Chance and the stirrings
of a longgone life have torn down the veil age spins so thick and fast
Pride and ambition what dull fools men are Effort and duty what dull
fools men are He listened on and on to these phantom pleadings and to
the rather coarse old Lawford conscience grunting them mercilessly down
too weary even to try to rest

Rooks at dawn came sweeping beneath the turquoise of the sky He saw
their sharpbeaked heads turn this way that way as they floated on
outspread wings across the misty world Except for the hoarse roar of
the water under the huge thinleafed trees not a sound was stirring
One thing he seemed to hear himself mutter as he turned with a shiver
from the morning air it wont be for long You can at least poor
devil wait the last act out If in this foolish hustling mob of the
world hired anywhere and anywhen for the one poor dubious wage of a
pennyif it was only his own small dull part to carry a mock spear
and shout huzza with the restthere was nothing for it he grunted
obstinately to himself shout he would with the loudest

He threw himself on to the bed with eyes so wearied with want of sleep
it seemed they had lost their livelong skill in finding it Not the echo
of triumph nor even a sigh of relief stirred the torpor of his mind He
knew vaguely that what had been the misery and madness of the last few
days was gone But the thought had no power to move him now Sheilas
good sense and Mr Bethanys stubborn loyalty were alike old stories
that had lost their savour and meaning Gone too was the need for that
portentous family gathering that had sat so often in his fancy during
these last few days around his diningroom table discussing with futile
decorum the problem of how to hush him up to muffle him down Half
dreaming half awake he saw the familiar door slowly open and like the
timely hero in a melodrama his own figure appear before the stricken
and astonished company His eyes opened halffearfully and glanced up
in the morning twilight Their perplexity gave place to a quiet almost
vacant smile the lids slowly closed again and at last the lean hands
twitched awhile in sleep

Next morning he spent rummaging among the old books dipping listlessly
here and there as the tasteless fancy took him while Herbert sat
writing with serene face and lifted eyebrows at his open window But the
unfamiliar long Ss the close type and the spelling of the musty old
books wearied eye and mind What he read too however farfetched
or lively or sententious or gross seemed either to be of the same
texture as what had become his everyday experience and so baffled him
with its nearness or else was only the meaningless ramblings of an idle
pen And this he thought to himself looking covertly up at the spruce
clearcut profile at the window this is what Herbert had called Life

Am I interrupting you Herbert are you very busy he asked at last
taking refuge on a chair in a far corner of the room

Bless me no not a bitnot a bit said Herbert amiably laying down
his pen Im afraid the old leatherjackets have been boring you Its
a habit this beastly reading this gorge and glint and fever all at
secondhandpurely a bad habit like morphia like laudanum But once
in you know theres no recovery Anyhow Im neckdeep and to struggle
would be simply to drown

I was only going to say how sorry I am for having left Sabathier at
home

My dear fellow began Herbert reassuringly

It was only because I wanted so very much to have your translation I
get muddled up with other things groping through the dictionary

Herbert surveyed him critically What exactly is your interest now
Lawford You dont mean that my old theory has left any sting now

No sting oh no I was only curious But you yourself still think it
really dont you

Herbert turned for a moment to the open window

I was simply trying then to find something to fit the facts as you
experienced them But now that the facts have goneand they have
havent theyexit of course my theory

I see was the cryptic answer And yet Herbert Lawford solemnly
began again it has changed me even in my way of thinking When I shut
my eyes nowI only discovered it by chanceI see immediately faces
quite strange to me or places sometimes thronged with people and once
an old well with some one sitting in the shadow I cant tell you how
clearly and yet it is all altogether different from a dream Even when
I sit with my eyes open I am conscious as it were of a kind of faint
colourless mirage In the old daysI mean before Widderstone what
I saw was only what Id seen already Nothing came uncalled for
unexplained This makes the old life seem so blank I did not know what
extraordinarily real things I was doing without And whether for that
reason or another I cant quite make out what in fact I did want then
and was always fretting and striving for I can see no wisdom or purpose
in anything now but to get to ones journeys end as quickly and bravely
as one can And even then even if we do call life a journey and death
the inn we shall reach at last in the evening when its over that too
I feel will be only as brief a stoppingplace as any other inn would
be Our experience here is so scanty and shallownothing more than the
moment of the continual present Surely that must go on even if one
does call it eternity And so we shall all have to begin again Probably
Sabathier himself But there what on earth are we Herbert when all
is said Who is it hashas done all this for uswhat kind of self
And to what possible end Is it that the clockwork has been wound up and
must still jolt on a while with jarring wheels Will it never run down
do you think

Herbert smiled faintly but made no answer

You see continued Lawford in the same quiet dispassionate
undertone I wouldnt mind if it was only myself But there are so many
of us so many selves I mean and they all seem to have a voice in the
matter What is the reality to this infernal dream

The reality is Lawford that you are fretting your life out over this
rotten illusion Be guided by me just this once Well go all three
of us a good tenmile walk today and thoroughly tire you out And
tonight you shall sleep herea really sound refreshing sleep Then
tomorrow whole and hale back you shall go honestly Its only
professional strong men should ask questions Babes like you and me must
keep to slops

So though Lawford made no answer it was agreed Before noon the three
of them had set out on their walk across the fields And after rambling
on just as caprice took them past reddening blackberry bushes and
copses of hazel and flaming beech they sat down to spread out their
meal on the slope of a hill overlooking quiet ploughed fields and
grazing cattle Herbert stretched himself with his back to the earth
and his placid face to the pale vacant sky while Lawford even more
dispirited after his walk wandered up to the crest of the hill

At the foot of the hill upon the other side lay a farm and its
outbuildings and a pool of water beneath a group of elms It was
vacant in the sunlight and the water vividly green with a scum of weed
And about half a mile beyond stood a cluster of cottages and an old
towered church He gazed idly down listening vaguely to the wailing of
a curlew flitting anxiously to and fro above the broken solitude of
its green hill And it seemed as if a thin and dark cloud began to be
quietly withdrawn from over his eyes Hill and wailing cry and barn and
water faded out And he was staring as if in an endless stillness at an
open window against which the sun was beating in a bristling torrent of
gold while out of the garden beyond came the voice of some evening bird
singing with such an unspeakable ecstasy of grief it seemed it must
be perched upon the confines of another world The light gathered to a
radiance almost intolerable driving back with its raining beams some
memory forlorn remorseless remote His body stood dark and senseless
rocking in the air on the hillside as if bereft of its spirit Then his
hands were drawn over his eyes He turned unsteadily and made his way
as if through a thick drizzling haze slowly back

What is thatthere he said almost menacingly standing with
bloodshot eyes looking down upon Herbert

Thatwhat said Herbert glancing up startled from his book Why
whats wrong Lawford

That said Lawford sullenly yet with a faintly mournful cadence in
his voice those fields and that old empty farmthat village over
there Why did you bring me here

Grisel had not stirred The village

Ssh she said catching her brothers sleeve thats Detcham yes
Detcham

Lawford turned wide vacant eyes on her He shook his head and shuddered
No no not Detcham I know it I know it but it has gone out of my
mind Not Detcham Ive been there before dont look at me Horrible
horrible It takes me backI cant think I stood there trying
trying its all in a blur Dont ask mea dream

Grisel leaned forward and touched his hand Dont think dont even
try Why should you We cant we MUSTNT go back

Lawford still gazing fixedly turned again a darkened face towards
the steep of the hill I think you know he said stooping and
whispering HE would knowthe window and the sun and the singing And
oh of course it was too late You understandtoo late And once you
cant go back oh no You wont leave me You see if you go it would
only be all I could not be quite so alone But DetchamDetcham
perhaps you will not trust metell me That was not the name
He shuddered violently and turned doglike beseeching eyes
Tomorrowyes tomorrow he said I will promise anything if you
will not leave me now Once But again the thread running so faintly
through that inextricable maze of memory eluded him So long as you
wont leave me now he implored her

She was vainly trying to win back her composure and could not answer
him at once

In the evening after supper Grisel sat her guest down in front of a big
wood fire in the old bookroom where staring into the playing flames
he could fall at peace into the almost motionless reverie which he
seemed merely to harass and weary himself by trying to disperse She
opened the little piano at the far end of the room and played on and
on as fancy ledChopin and Beethoven a fugue from Bach and lovely
forlorn old English airs till the music seemed not only a voice
persuading pondering and lamenting but gathered about itself the
hollow surge of the water and the darkness wistful and clear as the
thoughts of a solitary child Ever and again a log burnt through its
strength and falling amid sparks stirred like a restless animal the
stillness or Herbert in his corner lifted his head to glance towards
his visitor and to turn another page At last the music too fell
silent and Lawford stood up with his candle in his hand and eyed with a
strange fixity brother and sister His glance wandered slowly round the
quiet flamelit room

You wont he said stooping towards them as if in extreme confidence
you wont much notice They come and go I try not toto speak Its
the only way through It is not that I dont know theyre only dreams
But if once thethe others thought there had been any tamperinghe
tapped his forehead meaninglyhere if once they thought that it
would you know be quite over then How could I prove He turned
cautiously towards the door and with laborious significance nodded his
head at them

Herbert bent down and held out his long hands to the fire Tampering
my dear chap Thats what the lump said to the leaven

Yes yes said Lawford putting out his hand but you know what
I mean Herbert Anything I tried to do then would be quite quite
hopeless That would be poisoning the wells

They watched him out of the room and listened till quite distinctly in
the still nightshaded house they heard his door gently close Then as
if by consent they turned and looked long and questioningly into each
others faces

Then you are not afraid Herbert said quietly

Grisel gazed steadily on and almost imperceptibly shook her head

You mean he questioned her but still he had again to read her answer
in her eyes

Oh very well Grisel he said quietly you know best and returned
once more to his writing

For an hour or two Lawford slept heavily so heavily that when a little
after midnight he awoke with his face towards the uncurtained window
though for many minutes he lay brightly confronting all Orion that from
blazing helm to flaming dog at heel filled high the glimmering square
he could not lift or stir his cold and leaden limbs He rose at last and
threw off the burden of his bedclothes and rested awhile as if freed
from the heaviness of an unrememberable nightmare But so clear was his
mind and so extraordinarily refreshed he seemed in body that sleep for
many hours would not return again And he spent almost all the remainder
of the lagging darkness pacing softly to and fro one face only before
his eyes the one sure thing the one thing unattainable in a world of
phantoms

Herbert waited on in vain for his guest next morning and after
wandering up and down the mossy lawn at the back of the house went off
cheerfully at last alone for his dip When he returned Lawford was in
his place at the breakfasttable He sat on moody and constrained
until even Herberts haphazard talk trickled low

I fancy my sister is nursing a headache he said at last but shell
be down soon And Im afraid from the looks of you Lawford your night
was not particularly restful He felt his way very heedfully Perhaps
we walked you a little too far yesterday We are so used to tramping
that Lawford kept thoughtful eyes fixed on the deprecating face

I see what it is Herbertyou are humouring me again I have
been wracking my brains in vain to remember what exactly DID happen
yesterday I feel as if it was all sunk oceans deep in sleep I get so
farand then Im done It wont give up a hint But you really mustnt
think Im an invalid oror in my second childhood The truth is he
added its only my FIRST come back again But now that Ive got so
far now that Im really better I He broke off rather vacantly as
if afraid of his own confidence I must be getting on he summed
up with an effort and thats the solemn fact I keep on forgetting
ImIm a ratepayer

Herbert sat round in his chair You see Lawford the very term is
little else than DoubleDutch to me As a matter of fact Grisel sends
all my hushmoney to the horrible people that do the cleaning up as
it were I cant catch their drift Government to me is merely the
spectacle of the clever or the specious managing the dull It deals
merely with the physical and just the fringe of consciousness I am not
joking I think I follow you All I mean is that the obligationsmainly
tepid I take itthat are luring you back to the fold would be the
very ones that would scare me quickest off The imagination the appeal
faded were dead

Lawford opened his mouth TEMPORARILY tepid he at last all but
coughed out

Oh yes of course said Herbert intelligently Only temporarily Its
this beastly gregariousness thats the devil The very thought of it
undoes mewith an absolute shock of sheepishness I suddenly realise
my human nakedness that here we are little better than naked animals
bleating behind our illusory wattles on the slopes ofof infinity
And nakedness after all is a wholesome thing to realize only when one
thinks too much of ones clothes I peer sometimes feebly enough out
of my wool and it seems to me that all these busybodies all these
factdevourers all this newsreading rabble are nothing brighter than
very dullwitted children trying to play an imaginative game much too
deep for their poor reasons I dont mean that YOUR wanting to go home
is anything gregarious but I do think THEIR insisting on your coming
back at once might be And I know you wont visit this stuff on me as
anything more than just my scum as Grisel calls the fine flower of my
maiden meditations All that I really want to say is that we should both
be more than delighted if youd stay just as long as it will not be a
bore for you to stay Stay till youre heartily tired of us Go back
now if you MUST tell them how much better you are Bolt off to a nerve
specialist Hell say complete restchange of scene and all that They
all do Instinct via intellect And why not take your rest here We
are such miserably dull company to one another it would be a greater
pleasure to have you with us than I can say I mean it from the very
bottom of my heart Do

Lawford listened I wish he began and stopped dead again Anyhow
Ill go back I am afraid Herbert Ive been playing truant It was all
very well whileTo tell you the truth I cant think QUITE straight yet
But it wont last for ever Besideswell anyhow Ill go back

Right you are said Herbert pretending to be cheerful You cant
expect you really cant everything to come right straight away Just
have patience And now lets go out and sit in the sun Theyve mixed
September up with May

And about half an hour afterwards he glanced up from his book to find
his visitor fast asleep in his garden chair

Grisel had taken her brothers place with a little pile of needlework
beside her on the grass when Lawford again opened his eyes under the
rosy shade of a parasol He watched her for a while without speaking

How long have I been asleep he said at last

She started and looked up from her needle

That depends on how long you have been awake she said smiling My
brother tells me she went on beginning to stitch that you have
made up your mind to leave us today Perhaps we are only flattering
ourselves it has been a rest But if it hasis that do you think
quite wise

He leant forward and hid his face in his hands Its becauseits
because its the only must I can see

But even mustswell we have to be sure even of musts havent
we Are YOU She glanced up and for an instant their eyes met and the
falling water seemed to be sounding out of a distance so remote it might
be but the echo of a dream She stooped once more over her work

Supposing he said very slowly and almost as if speaking to himself
supposing Sabathierand you know hes merely like a friend now one
mustnt be seen talking tosupposing he came back what then

Oh but Sabathiers gone he never really came It was only a fancya
mood It was only youanother you

Who was that yesterday then

She glanced at him swiftly and knew the question was but a venture

Yesterday

Oh very well he said fretfully you too But if he did if he did
come really back prey and all

What is the riddle she said taking a deep breath and facing him
brightly

Would MY must still be HIS The face he raised to her as he leaned
forward under the direct light of the sun was so colourless cadaverous
and haggard the thought crossed her mind that it did indeed seem little
more than a shadowy mask that but one hour of darkness might dispel

You said you know we did win through Why then should we be even
thinking of defeat now

We

Oh no you she cried triumphantly

You do not answer my question

Nor you mine It WAS a glorious victory Is there the ghost of a reason
why you should cast your mind back Is there now

Only said Lawford looking patiently up into her face only because
I love you and listened in the silence to the words as one may watch a
bird that has escaped for ever and irrevocably out of its cage steadily
flying on and on till lost to sight

For an instant the grey eyes faltered But that surely she began
in a low voice still steadily sewing that was our compact last
nightthat you should let me help that you should trust me just as you
trusted the mother years ago who came in the little cart with the shaggy
dusty pony to the homesick boy watching at the window Perhaps she
added her fingers trembling in this odd shuffle of souls and faces
I AM that mother and most frightfully anxious you should not give in
Why even because of the tiredness even because the cause seems vain
you must still fight onwouldnt she have said it Surely there are
prizes a daughter a career no end And even they gonestill the self
undimmed undaunted that took its drubbing like a man

I know you know Im all but crazed you see this wretched mind all
littered and broken down look at me like that then Forget even you
have befriended me and pretendedWhy must I blunder on and on like
this Oh Grisel my friend my friend if only you loved me

Tears clouded her eyes She turned vaguely as if for a hidingplace
We cant talk here How mad the day is Listen listen I doI do love
youmother and woman and friendfrom the very moment you came Its
all so clear so clear that and your miserable must my friend
Come we will go away by ourselves a little and talk That way Ill
meet you by the gate



CHAPTER TWENTYONE

She came out into the sunlight and they went through the little gate
together She walked quickly without speaking over the bridge past a
little cottage whose hollyhocks leaned fading above its low flint wall
Skirting a field of stubble she struck into a wood by a path that ran
steeply up the hillside And by and by they came to a glen where the
woodmen of a score of years ago had felled the trees leaving a green
hollow of saplings in the midst of their towering neighbours

There she said holding out her hand to him now we are alone Just
six hours or soand then the sun will be there she pointed to the
treetops to the west and then you will have to go for good for
goodyou your way and I mine What a tanglea tangle is this life of
ours Could I have dreamt we should ever be talking like this you and
I Friends of an hour What will you think of me Does it matter Dont
speak Say nothingpoor face poor hands If only there were something
to look toto pray to She bent over his hand and pressed it to her
breast What worlds weve seen together you and I And thenanother
parting

They wandered on a little way and came back and listened to the first
few birds that flew up into the higher branches noonday being past to
sing

They talked and were silent and talked again with out question or
sadness or regret or reproach she mocking even at themselves mocking
at this changeWhy and yet without it would you ever even have
dreamed once a poor fool of a Frenchman went to his restless grave for
mefor me Need we understand Were we told to pry Who made us
human must be human too Why must we take such care and make such a
fretthis soul I know it I know it it is all we haveto save
they say poor creatures No never to SPEND and so they darent for a
solitary instant lift it on the finger from its cage Well we have and
now soon back it must go back it must go and try its best to whistle
the day out And yet do you know perhaps the very freedom does a
little shake itsits monotony Its true you see they have lived
a long time these Worldly Wisefolk they were wise before they were
swaddled

There and you are hungry she asked him laughing in his eyes Of
course of course you arescarcely a mouthful since that first still
wonderful supper And you havent slept a wink except like a tiredout
child after its first party on that old garden chair I sat and
watched and yes almost hoped youd never wake in casein case Come
along see down there I cant go home just yet Theres a little old
innwell go and sit down thereas if we were really trying to be
romantic I know the woman quite well we can talk therejust the day
out

They sat at a little table in the garden of The Cherry Trees its
thick green apple branches burdened with ripened fruit And Grisel tried
to persuade him to eat and drink for tomorrow we die she said
her hands trembling her face as it were veiled with a faint mysterious
light

There are dozens and dozens of old stories you know she said
leaning on her elbows dozens and dozens meaning only us You must
you must eat look just an apple Weve got to say goodbye And
faintness will double the difficulty She lightly touched his hand as
if to compel him to smile with her There Ill peel it and this is
Eden and soon it will be the cool of the evening And then oh yes the
voice will come What nonsense I am talking Never mind

They sat on in the quiet sunshine and a spider slid softly through
the air and with busy claws set to its nets and those small ghosts the
robins went whistling restlessly among the heavy boughs

A child presently came out of the porch of the inn into the garden and
stood with its battered doll in its arms softly watching them awhile
But when Grisel smiled and tried to coax her over she burst out
laughing and ran in again

Lawford stooped forward on his chair with a groan You see he said
the whole world mocks me You say this evening need it be must it
be this evening If you only knew how far they have driven me If you
only knew what we should only detest each other for saying and
for listening to The whole things dulled and staled Who wants
a changeling Who wants a painted bird Who does not loathe the
convertedand Im converted to Sabathiers God Should we be sitting
here talking like this if it were not so I cant I cant go back

She rose and stood with her hand pressed over her mouth watching him

Wont you understand he continued I am an outcasta felon caught
redhanded come in the flesh to a hideous and righteous judgment I
hear myself saying all these things and yet Grisel I do I do love
you with all the dull best I ever had Not now then I dont ask new
even I can I would begin again God knows my face has changed enough
even as it is Think of me as that poor wandering ghost of yours how
easily I could hide awayin your memory and just wait wait for you
In time even this wild futile madness too would fade away Then I could
come back May I try

I cant answer you I cant reason Only still I do know talk put
off forget as I may must is must Right and wrong who knows what
THEY mean except that ones to be done and ones to be forsworn
orforgive my friend the truest thing I ever saidor else we lose
the savour of both Oh then and I know too youd weary of me I know
you Monsieur Nicholas better than you can ever know yourself though
you have risen from your grave You follow a dream no voice or face or
flesh and blood and not to do what the one old raven within you cries
you must would be in time to hate the very sound of my footsteps You
shall go back poor turncoat and face the clearness the utterly more
difficult bald and heartless clearness as together we faced the dark
Life is a little while And though I have no words to tell what always
are and must be foolish reasons because they are not reasons at all but
ghosts of memory I know in my heart that to face the worst is your only
hope of peace Should I have staked so much on your finding that and
now throw up the game Dont let us talk any more Ill walk half
the way perhaps Perhaps I will walk all the way I think my brother
guessesat least MY madness Ive talked and talked him nearly past his
patience And then when you are quite safely oh yes quite safely and
soundly gone then I shall go away for a little so that we cant even
hear each other speak except in dreams Lifewell I always thought
it was much too plain a tale to have as dull an ending And with us the
powers beyond have played a newer trick thats all Another hour and
we will go Till then theres just the solitary walk home and only the
dull old haunted house that hoards as many ghosts as we ourselves to
watch our coming

Evening began to shine between the trees they seemed to stand aflame
with a melancholy rapture in their uplifted boughs above their fading
coats The fields of the garnered harvest shone with a golden stillness
awhir with shimmering flocks of starlings And the old birds that had
sung in the spring sang now amid the same leaves grown older too to
give them harbourage

Herbert was sitting in his room when they returned nursing his teacup
on his knee while he pretended to be reading with elbow propped on the
table

Heres Nicholas Sabathier my dear come to say goodbye awhile
said Grisel She stood for a moment in her white gown her face turned
towards the clear green twilight of the open window I have promised to
walk part of the way with him But I think first we must have some tea
No he flatly refuses to be driven We are going to walk

The two friends were left alone face to face with a rather difficult
silence only the least degree of nervousness apparent so far as
Herbert was concerned in that odd aloof sustained air of impersonality
that had so baffled his companion in their first queer talk together

Your sister said just now Herbert blurted Lawford at last Heres
Nicholas Sabathier come to say goodbye well Iwhat I want you to
understand is that it is Sabathier the worst he ever was but also that
it is goodbye

Herbert slowly turned I dont quite see why goodbye Lawford
Andfrankly there is nothing to explain We have chosen to live such
a very outoftheway life he went on as if following up a train of
thought The truth is if one wants to live at allones own life
I meantheres no time for many friends And just steadfastly regarding
your neighbours tail as you follow it down into the Nowhereits that
that seems to me the deadliest form of hypnotism One must simply go
ones own way doing ones best to free ones mind of cantand I dare
say clearing some excellent stuff out with the rubbish One consequence
is that I dont think however foolhardy it may be to say so I dont
think I care a groat for any opinion as human as my own good or bad My
sisters a million times a better woman than I am a man What possibly
could there be then for me to say He turned with a nervous smile
Why should it be goodbye

Lawford glanced involuntarily towards the door that stood in shadow
duskily ajar Well he said we have talked and we think it must
be that until at least he smiled faintly I can come as quietly as
your old ghost you told me of and in that case it may not be so very
long to wait

Their eyes met fleetingly across the still listening room The more
I think of it Lawford pushed slowly on the less I understand the
frantic purposelessness of all that has happened to me Until I
went down as you said a godsend of a little Miss Muffet and the
inconceivable farce came off I was fairly happy fairly contented to
dance my little wooden dance and wait till the showman should put me
down into his box again And nowwell here I am The whole thing has
gone by and scarcely left a trace of its visit Here I am for all my
friends to swear to and yet Herbert if youll forgive me troubling
you with this stuff about myself not a single belief or thought or
desire remains unchanged You will remember all that I hope Its not
of course the ghost of an apology only the mere facts

Herbert rose and paced slowly across to the window The longer I live
Lawford the more I curse this futile gift of speech Here am I wanting
to tell you to say out frankly what if mind could appeal direct to
mind would be merely as the wind passing through the leaves of a tree
with just oneone multitudinous rustle but which if I tried to
put into wordswell daybreak would find us still groping on He
turned a peculiar wry smile on his face Its a dumb world but there
we are And some day youll come again

Well said Lawford as if with an almost hopeless effort to turn
thought into such primitive speech thats where we stand then He
got up suddenly like a man awakened in the midst of unforeseen danger
Where is your sister he cried looking into the shadow And as if in
actual answer to his entreaty they heard the clinking of the cups on
the little old green lacquer tray she was at that moment carrying into
the room She sat down on the window seat and put the tray down beside
her It will be before dark even now she said glancing out at the
faintly burning skies

They had trudged on together with almost as deep a sense of physical
exhaustion as peasants have who have been labouring in the fields since
daybreak And a little beyond the village before the last long road
began that led in presently to the housed and scrupulous suburb she
stopped with a sob beside an old scarred milestone by the wayside
Thisis as far as I can go she said She stooped and laid her hand
on the cold mossgrown surface of the stone Even now its wet with
dew She rose again and looked strangely into his face Yes yes here
it is she said oh and worse worse than any fear But nothing now
can trouble you again of that Were both at least past that

Grisel he said forgive me but I cantI cant go on

Dont think dont think she said taking his hands and lifting them
to her bosom Its only how the day goes and it has all my one
dear happened scores and scores of times beforemother and child and
friendand lovers that are all these too like us We mustnt cry out
Perhaps it was all before even we could speakthis sorrow came Take
all the hope and all the future and then may come our chance

Whats life to me now You said the desire would come back that I
should shake myself free I could if you would help me I dont know
what you are or what your meaning is only that I love you care for
nothing wish for nothing but to see you and think of you A flat dull
voice keeps saying that I have no right to be telling you all this
You will know best I know I am nothing I ask nothing If we love one
another what is there else to say

Nothing nothing to say except only goodbye What could you tell
me that I have not told myself over and over again Reasons gone
Thinkings gone Now I am only sure She smiled shadowily What peace
did HE find who couldnt perhaps like you face the last goodbye

They stood in utter solitude awhile in the evening gloom The air was
as still and cold as some grey unfathomable untraversed sea Above them
uncountable clouds drifted slowly across space

Why do they all keep whispering together he said in a low voice with
cowering face Oh if you knew Grisel how they have hemmed me in how
they have come pressing in through the narrow gate I left ajar Only to
mock and mislead Its all dark and unintelligible

He touched her hand peering out of the shadows that seemed to him to be
gathering between their faces He drew her closer and touched her lips
with his fingers Her beauty seemed to his distorted senses to fill
earth and sky This then was the presence the grave and lovely
overshadowing dream whose surrender made life a torment and death the
near fold of an immortal starry veil She broke from him with a faint
cry And he found himself running and running just as he had run that
other night with death instead of life for inspiration towards his
earthly home



CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

He was utterly wearied but he walked on for a long while with a dogged
unglancing pertinacity and without looking behind him Then he rested
under the dewsodden hedgeside and buried his face in his hands Once
indeed he did turn and grind his way back with hard uplifted face for
many minutes but at the meeting with an old woman who in the late dusk
passed him unheeded on the road he stopped again and after standing
awhile looking down upon the dust trying to gather up the tangled
threads of his thoughts he once more set off homewards

It was clear starry and quite dark when he reached the house The lamp
at the roadside obscurely lit its breadth and height Lamplight within
too was showing yellow between the Venetian blinds a cold gasjet
gleamed out of the basement window He seemed bereft now of all desire
or emotion simply the passive witness of things external in a calm
which though he scarcely realised its cause was an exquisite solace
and relief His senses were intensely sharpened with sleeplessness The
faintest sound belled clear and keen on his ear The thinnest beam of
light besprinkled his eyes with curious brilliance

As quietly as some nocturnal creature he ascended the steps to the
porch and leaning between stone pilaster and wall listened intently
for any rumour of those within

He heard a clear rather languid and delicate voice quietly speak on
until it broke into a little peal of laughter followed when it fell
silent by Sheilasrapid rich and low The first speaker seemed to be
standing Probably then his evening visitors had only just come in or
were preparing to depart He inserted his latchkey and gently pushed at
the cumbersome door It was locked against him With not the faintest
thought of resentment or surprise he turned back stooped over the
balustrade and looked down into the kitchen Nothing there was visible
but a narrow strip of the white table on which lay a black cotton
glove and beyond the glint of a copper pan What made all these mute
and inanimate things so coldly hostile

An extreme almost nauseous distaste filled him at the thought of
knocking for admission of confronting Ada possibly even Sheila in the
cold echoing gloom of the detestable porch of meeting the first wild
almost metallic flash of recognition He swept softly down again and
paused at the open gate Once before the voices of the night had called
him they would not summon him forever in vain He raised his eyes again
towards the window Who were these visitors met together to drum the
alien out He narrowed his lids and smiled up at the vacuous unfriendly
house Then wheeling on a sudden impulse he groped his way down the
gravel path that led into the garden As he had left it the long white
window was ajar

With extreme caution he pushed it noiselessly up and climbed in and
stood listening again in the black passage on the other side When
he had fully recovered his breath and the knocking of his heart was
stilled he trod on softly till turning the corner he came in sight
of the kitchen door It was now narrowly open just enough perhaps to
admit a cat and as he softly approached looking steadily in he
could see Ada sitting at the empty table beneath the single whistling
chandelier in her black dress and black straw hat She was reading
apparently but her back was turned to him and he could not distinguish
her arm beyond the elbow Then almost in an instant he discovered as
drawn up and unstirring he gazed on that she was not reading but had
covertly and instantaneously raised her eyes from the print on the table
beneath and was transfixedly listening too He turned his eyes away and
waited When again he peered in she had apparently bent once more over
her magazine and he stole on

One by one with a thin remote exultation in his progress he mounted
the kitchen stairs and with each deliberate and groping step the voices
above him became more clearly audible At last in the darkness of the
hall but faintly stirred by the gleam of lamplight from the chink of
the diningroom door he stood on the threshold of the drawingroom door
and could hear with varying distinctness what those friendly voices
were so absorbedly discussing His ear seemed as exquisite as some
contrivance of science registering passively the least sound the
faintest syllable and like it in no sense meddling with the thought
that speech conveyed He simply stood listening fixed and motionless
like some uncouth statue in the leafy hollow of a garden stony
unspeculating

Oh but you either refuse to believe Bettie or you wont understand
that its far worse than that Sheila seemed to be upbraiding or at
least reasoning with the last speaker Ask Mr Dantonhe actually SAW
him

Saw him repeated a thick still voice He stood there in that
very doorway Mrs Lovat and positively railed at me He stood there
and streamed out all the names he could lay his tongue to I
wasntunfriendly to the poor beggar When Bethany let me into it
I thought it was simplyI did indeed Mrs Lawforda monstrous
exaggeration Flatly I didnt believe it shall I say that But when I
stood face to face with him I could have taken my oath that that was no
more poor old Arthur Lawford thanwell I wont repeat what particular
word occurred to me But there the corpulent shrug was almost audible
we all know what old Bethany is A sterling old chap mind you so far
as mere character is concerned the right man in the right place but as
gullible and as softhearted as a tomtit Ive said all this before I
know Mrs Lawford and been properly snubbed for my pains But if I
had been Bethany Id have sifted the whole story at the beginning
the moment he put his foot into the house Look at that Tichborne
fellowwent for months and months just picking up one day what he
floored old Hawkinswasnt itwith the next But of course he added
gloomily now thats all too late Hes moaned himself into a tolerably
tight corner Id just like to see though a British jury comparing
this claimant with his photograph pon my word I would Where would he
be then do you think

But my dear Mr Danton went on the clear languid voice Lawford had
heard break so lightheartedly into laughter you dont mean to tell me
that a woman doesnt know her own husband when she sees himor for the
matter of that when she doesnt see him If Tom came home from a ramble
as handsome as Apollo tomorrow Id recognise him at the very first
blushliterally Hed go nuzzling off to get his slippers or complain
that the lamps had been smoking or hunt the house down for last weeks
paper Oh besides Toms Tomand theres an end of it

Thats precisely what I think Mrs Lovat one is saturated with ones
personality as it were

You see thats just it Thats just exactly every womans husband all
over he is saturated with his personality Bravo Mr Craik

Good Lord said Danton softly I dont deny it

But that broke in Sheila crisplythats just precisely what I asked
you all to come in for Its because I know now apart altogether from
the mere evidence thatthat he is Arthur Mind I dont say I ever
really doubted I was only so utterly shocked I suppose I positively
put posers to him but his memory was perfect in spite of the shock
which would have killed aa more sensitive nature She had risen it
seemed and was moving with all her splendid impressiveness of silk and
presence across the general line of vision But the hall was dark and
still her eyes were dimmed with light Lawford could survey her there
unmoved

Are you there Ada she called discreetly

Yes maam answered the faint voice from below

You have not heard anythingno knock

No maam no knock

The door is open if you should call

Yes maam

The girls scared out of her wits said Sheila returning to her
audience Ive told you all that miserable Ferguson storya piece of
calm callous presence of mind I should never have dreamed my husband
capable of And the curious thing isat least it is no longer curious
in the light of the ghastly facts I am only waiting for Mr Bethany
to tell youfrom the very first she instinctively detested the very
mention of his name

I believe you know said Mr Craik with some decision that servants
must have the same wonderful instinct as dogs and children they are
natural intuitive judges of character

Yes said Sheila gravely and its only through that that I got to
hear of thethe mysterious friend in the little ponycarriage Adas
magnificently loyalI will say that

I dont want to suggest anything Mrs Lawford began Mr Craik rather
hurriedly but wouldnt it perhaps be wiser not to wait for Mr Bethany
It is not at all unusual for him to be kept a considerable time in the
vestry after service and today is the Feast of St Michaels and all
Angels you know Mightnt your husband beercoming back dont you
think

Craiks right Mrs Lawford its not a bit of good waiting Bethany
would stick there till midnight if any old womans spiritual state could
keep her going so long Here we all are and at any moment we may be
interrupted Mind you I promise nothingonly that there shall be
no scene But here I am and if he does come knocking and ringing and
lunging out in the disgusting manner hewell all I ask is permission
to speak for YOU Pon my soul to think what you must have gone
through It isnt the place for ladies just nowhonestly it aint

Besides supposing the romantic lady of the ponycarriage has friends
Are YOU a pugilist Mr Craik

I hope I could give some little account of myself Mrs Lovat but you
need have no anxiety about that

There Mr Danton So as there is not the least cause for anxiety even
if poor Arthur SHOULD return to his earthly home may we share your
dreadful story at once Sheila and then perhaps hear Mr Bethanys
exposition of it when he DOES arrive We are amply guarded

Honestly you know you are a bit of a sceptic Mrs Lovat pleaded
Danton playfully Ive SEEN him

And seeing is disbelieving I suppose Now then Sheila

I dont think theres the least chance of Arthur returning tonight
said Sheila solemnly I am perfectly well aware its best to be as
cheerful as one canand as resolved but I think Bettie when even
you know the whole horrible secret you wont think Mr Danton waswas
horrified for nothing The ghastly the awful truth is that my
husbandthere is no other word for itispossessed

Possessed Sheila What in the name of all the creeps is that

Well I dare say Mr Craik will explain it much better than I can By
a devil dear The voice was perfectly poised and restrained and Mr
Craik did not see fit for the moment to embellish the definition

Lawford with an almost wooden immobility listened on

But THE devil or A devil Isnt there a distinction inquired Mrs
Lovat

Its in the Bible Bettie over and over again It was quite a common
thing in the Middle Ages I think Im right in saying that am I not
Mr Craik Mr Craik must have solemnly nodded or abundantly looked
his unwilling affirmation And what HAS been continued Sheila
temperately I suppose may be again

When the fellow began raving at me the other night began Danton
huskily as if out of an unfathomable pit of reflection among other
things he said that I havent any wish to remember was that I was a
sceptic And Bethany said DITTO to it I dont mind being called a
sceptic why I said myself Mrs Lovat was a sceptic just now But when
it comes to devils Mrs LawfordI may be convinced about the other
but devils Well Ive been in the City nearly twentyfive years and
its my impression human nature can raise all the devils WE shall
ever need And another thing he added as if inspired and with an
immensely intelligent blink is it just precisely that word in the
Revised Versioneh Craik

Ill certainly look it up Danton But I take it that Mrs Lawford is
not so much insisting on the word as on thethe manifestation And
Im bound to confess that the Society for Psychical Research which
has among its members quite eminent and entirely trustworthy men of
scienceI am bound to admit they have some very curious stories to
tell The old idea was you know that there are seventytwo princely
devils and as many as seven millionercommoners It may very well
sound quaint to our ears Mrs Lovat but there it is But whether
that has any bearing onon what you were saying Danton I cant say
Perhaps Mrs Lawford will throw a little more light on the subject
when she tells us on what precise facts herher distressing theory is
based

Lawford had soundlessly stolen a pace or two nearer and by stooping
forward a little he could each in turn scrutinise the little intent
company sitting over his story around the lamp at the further end of the
table squatting like little children with their twigs and pins fishing
for wonders on the brink of the unknown

Yes Mrs Lovat was saying I quite agree Mr Craik Seventytwo
princes and no princesses Oh these masculine prejudices But do throw
a little more modern light on the subject Sheila

I mean this said Sheila firmly When I went in for the last time to
say goodbyeand of course it was at his own wish that I did leave him
and precisely WHY he wished it is now unhappily only too apparentI had
brought him some money from the bankfifty pounds I think yes fifty
pounds And quite by the merest chance I glanced down in passing at a
book he had apparently been reading a book which he seemed very anxious
to conceal with his hand Arthur is not a great reader though I believe
he studied a little before we were married andwell I detest anything
like subterfuge and I said it out without thinking Why youre
reading French Arthur He turned deathly white but made no answer

And cant you even confide to us the title Sheila sighed Mrs Lovat
reproachfully

Wait a minute said Sheila you shall make as much fun of the thing
as you like Bettie when Ive finished I dont know why but that
peculiar stealthy look haunted me Why French I kept asking myself
Why French Arthur hasnt opened a French book for years He doesnt
even approve of the entente His argument was that we ought to be
friends with the Germans because they are more hostile Never mind When
Ada came back the next evening and said he was out I came the following
morningby myselfand knocked No one answered and I let myself in
His bed had not been slept in There were candles and matches all over
the houseone even burnt nearly to the stick on the floor in the corner
of the drawingroom I suppose it was foolish but I was alone and just
that somehow horrified me It seemed to point to such a peculiar state
of mind I hesitated what was the use of looking further Yet something
seemed to say to meand it was surely providentialGo downstairs
And there in the breakfastroom the first thing I saw on the table
was this booka dingy ragged bleared patchedup oh a horrible
a loathsome little book and I have read bits too here and there
and beside it was my own little school dictionary my own childs She
looked up sharply What was that Did anybody call

Nobody I heard said Danton staring stonily round

It may have been the passing of the wind suggested Mr Craik after a
pause

Peep between the blinds Mr Craik it may be poor Mr Bethany
confronting Pneumonia in the porch

Theres no one there Mrs Lovat said the curate returning softly
from his errand Please continue youryour narrative Mrs Lawford

We are panting for the devil my dear

Well I sat down and very much against my inclination turned over the
pages It was full of the most revolting confessions and trials so
far as I could see In fact I think the book was merely an amateur
collection ofof horrors And the faces the portraits Well then can
you imagine my feelings when towards the end of the book about thirty
pages from the end I came upon thisgloating up at me from the table
in my house before my very eyes

She cast a rapid glance over her shoulder and gathering up her silk
skirt drew out from the pocket beneath the few crumpled pages and
passed them without a word to Danton Lawford kept him plainly in view
as lowering his great face he slowly stooped and holding the loose
leaves with both fat hands between his knees stared into the portrait
Then he truculently lifted his cropped head

What did I say he said What did I SAY What did I tell old Bethany
in this very room What dye think of that Mrs Lovat for a portrait of
Arthur Lawford What dye make of that Craikeh Devileh

Mrs Lovat glanced with arched eyebrows and with her fingertips handed
the sheets on to her neighbour who gazed with a settled and mournful
frown and returned them to Sheila

She took the pages folded them and replaced them carefully in her
pocket She swept her hands over her skirts and turned to Danton

You agree she inquired softly its like

Like Its the livin livid image The livin image he repeated
stretching out his arm as he stood there that very night

What will you say then said Sheila quietly What will you say if I
tell you that that man Nicholas de Sabathier has been in his grave for
over a hundred years

Dantons little eyes seemed if anything to draw back even further
into his head Id say Mrs Lawford if youll excuse the word that
it might be a damn horrible coincidenceId go farther an almost
incredible coincidence But if you want the sober truth Id say it was
nothing more than a crafty clever abominable piece of trickery Thats
what Id say Oh you dont know Mrs Lovat When a scamps a scamp
hell stop at nothing I could tell you some tales

Ah but thats not all said Sheila eyeing them steadfastly one by
one We all of us know that my husbands story was that he had gone
down to Widderstoneinto the churchyard for his convalescent ramble
that storys true We all know that he said he had had a fit a heart
attack and that a kind ofof stupor had come over him I believe on my
honour thats true too But no one knows but he himself and Mr Bethany
and I that it was a wretched broken grave quite at the bottom of the
hill that he chose for his resting place norand I cant get the
scene out of my headnor that the name on that one solitary tombstone
down there waswasthis

Danton rolled his eyes I dont begin to follow he said stubbornly

You dont mean said Mr Craik who had not removed his gaze from
Sheilas face I am not to take it that you mean Mrs Lawford thethe
other

Yes said Sheila HISshe patted her skirtsSabathiers

You mean said Mrs Lovat crisply that the man in the grave is the
man in the book and that the man in the book isis poor Arthurs
changed face

Sheila nodded

Danton rose cumbrously from his chair looking beadily down on his three
friends

Oh but you know it isntit isnt right he began Lord I can see
him now Glassyyes thats the very word I saidglassy It wont do
Mrs Lawford on my solemn honour it wont do I dont deny it call it
what you like yes devils if you like But what I say as a practical
man is that its just rankthats what it is Bethanys had too much
rope The times gone by for sentiment and all that foolery Mercys all
very well but after all its justice that clinches the bargain Theres
only one way we must catch him we must lay the poor wretch by the
heels before its too late No publicity God bless me no Wed have
all the rags in London on us Theyd pillory us nine days on end Wed
never live it down No we must just hush it upa home or something
an asylum For my part he turned like a huge toad his chin low in his
collarand Id say the same if it was my own brother and after all
he is your husband Mrs LawfordId sooner he was in his grave It
takes two to play at that game thats what I say To lay himself open
I cant stand ithonestly I cant stand it And yet he jerked his
chin over the peak of his collar towards the ladies and yet you say
hes being fetched comes creeping home and is fetched at dark by aa
lady in a ponycarriage God bless me Its rank What he broke out
violently again what was he doing there in a cemetery after dark Do
you think that beastly Frenchman would have played such a trick on Craik
here Would he have tried his little game on me Deviltry be it if
you prefer the word and all deference to you Mrs Lawford But I know
thisa couple of hundred years ago they would have burnt a man at the
stake for less than a tenth of this Ask Craik here I dont know how
and I dont know when his mother Ive always heard say was a little
eccentric but the truth is hes managed by some unholy legerdemain to
get the thing at his fingers ends thats what it is Think of that
unspeakable book Left open on the table Look at his Ferguson game
Its our solemn duty to keep him for good and all out of mischief It
reflects all round Theres no getting out of it were all in it And
tar sticks And then theres poor little Alice to consider andand
you yourself Mrs Lawford I wouldnt give the fellowfriend though
he was in a wayit isnt safe to give him five minutes freedom
Weve simply got to save you from yourself Mrs Lawford thats what it
isand from oldfashioned sentiment And I only wish Bethany was here
now to dispute it

He stirred himself down as it were into his clothes and stood in the
middle of the hearthrug gently oscillating with his hands behind
his back But at some faint rumour out of the silent house his posture
suddenly stiffened and he lifted a little with heavy steady lids his
head

What is the matter Danton said Mr Craik in a small voice why are
you listening

I wasnt listening said Danton stoutly I was thinking

At the same moment at the creak of a footstep on the kitchen stairs
Lawford also had drawn soundlessly back into the darkness of the empty
drawingroom

While Mr Danton is thinking Sheila Mrs Lovat was softly
interposing do please listen a moment to me Do you mean really that
that Frenchmanthe one youve pocketedis the poor creature in the
grave

Yes Mrs Lawford said Mr Craik putting out his face a little are
we to take it that you mean that

Its the same date dear the same name even to the spelling what
possibly else can I think

And that the poor creature in the grave actually climbed up out of the
darkness andwell what

I know no more than you do NOW Bettie But the two facesyou must
remember you havent seen my husband SINCE You must remember you
havent heard the peculiarthe most peculiar things heArthur
himselfhas said to me Things such as a wife And not in jest
Bettie I assure you

And Mr Bethany interpolated Mr Craik modestly feeling his way

Pah Bethany Craik Hed back Old Nick himself if he came with a good
tale Weve got to act weve got to settle his hash before he does any
mischief

Well began Mrs Lovat smiling a little remorsefully beneath the arch
of her raised eyebrows I sincerely hope youll all forgive me but I
really am heart and soul with Old Nick as Mr Danton seems on intimate
terms enough to call him Dead he is really immensely alluring and
alive I think awfullyjust awfully pitiful andand pathetic But if
I know anything of Arthur he wont be beaten by a Frenchman As for
just the portrait I think do you know I almost prefer dark menshe
glanced up at the face immediately in front of the clockat least
she added softly when they are not looking very vindictive I suppose
people are fairly often possessed Mr Craik HOW many deadly sins are
there

As a matter of fact Mrs Lovat there are seven But I think in this
case Mrs Lawford intends to suggest not so much thatthat her husband
is in that condition habitual sin you knowgrave enough of course
I ownbut that he is actually being compelled even to the extent of a
more or less complete change of physiognomy to follow the biddings of
some atrocious spiritual influence It is no breach of confidence to
say that I have myself been present at a deathbed where the struggle
against what I may call the end was perfectly awful to witness I
dont profess to follow all the ramifications of the affair but though
possibly Mr Danton may seem a little harsh such harshness if I may
venture to intercede is not necessarily vindictive Andand personal
security is a consideration

If you only knew the awful fear the awful uncertainty I have been
in Bettie Oh it is worse infinitely worse than you can possibly
imagine I have myself heard the Voice speak out of hima high hard
nasal voice Ive seen what Mr Danton calls the glassiness come into
his face and an expression so wild and so appallingly depraved as
it were that I have had to hurry downstairs to hide myself from the
thought Im willing to sacrifice everything for my own husband and for
Alice but can it be expected of me to go on harbouring Lawford
listened on in vain for a moment poor Sheila it seemed had all but
broken down

Look here Mrs Lawford began Danton huskily you really mustnt give
way you really mustnt Its awful unspeakably awful I admit But
here we are friends in the midst of friends And theres absolutely
nothingWhats that Eh Who is it Oh the maid

Ada stood in the doorway looking in All Ive come to ask maam she
said in a low voice is am I to stay downstairs any longer And are
you aware theres somebody in the house

Whats that Whats that youre saying broke out the husky voice
again Control yourself Speak gently Whats that

Begging your pardon sir Im perfectly under control And all I say is
that I cant stay any longer alone downstairs there Theres somebody in
the house

A concentrated hush seemed to have fallen on the little assembly

Somebodybut who said Sheila out of the silence You come up
here Ada with these idle fancies Whos in the house There has been
no knockno footstep

No knock no footstep maam that Ive heard Its Dr Ferguson maam
He was here that first night and hes been here ever since He was here
when I came on Tuesday and he was here last night And hes here now
I cant be deceived by my own feelings Its not right its not
outspoken to keep me in the dark like this And if you have no
objection I would like to go home

Lawford in his utter weariness had nearly closed the door and now sat
bent up on a chair wondering vaguely when this poor play was coming to
an end longing with an intensity almost beyond endurance for the keen
night air the open sky But still his ears drank in every tiniest sound
or stir He heard Dantons lowered voice muttering his arguments He
heard Ada quietly sniffing in the darkness of the hall And this was his
world This was his lifes panorama creaking on at every jolt This was
the must Grisel had sent him back tothese poor fools packed
together in a panic at an old stale tale Well they would all come out
presently and cluster and the crested cackling fellow would lead them
safely away out of the haunted farmyard

He started out of his reverie at Dantons voice close at hand

Look here my good girl we havent the least intention of keeping you
in the dark If you want to leave your mistress like this in the midst
of her anxieties she says you can go and welcome But its not a bit of
good in the world coming up with these cockandbull stories The truth
is your masters mad thats the sober truth of ithopelessly insane
you understand and weve got to find him But nothings to be said
dye see Its got to be done without fuss or scandal But if theres
any witness wanted or anything of that kind why here you are and
he dropped his voice to an almost inaudible hoot and well worth your
while You did see him eh Step into the trap and all that

Ada stood silent a moment I dont know sir she began quietly by
what right you speak to me about what you call my cockandbull stories
If the master is mad all I can say to anybody is Im very sorry to hear
it I came to my mistress sir if you please and I prefer to take my
orders from one who has a right to give them Did I understand you to
say maam that you wouldnt want me any more this evening

Sheila had swept solemnly to the door Mr Danton meant all that he said
quite kindly Ada I can perfectly understand your feelingsperfectly
And Im very much obliged to you for all your kindness to me in very
trying circumstances We are all agreedwe are forced to the terrible
conclusion whichwhich Mr Danton has justexpressed And I know I
can rely on your discretion Dont stay on a moment if you really are
afraid But when you say some one Ada do you meansome one like you
or me or do you meanthe other

Ive been sitting in the kitchen maam unable to move Im watched
everywhere The other evening I went into the drawingroomI was alone
in the houseand I cant describe it It wasnt dark and yet it was
all still and black like the ruins after a fire I dont mean I saw it
only that it was like a scene And then the watchingI am quite aware
to some it may sound all fancy But Im not superstitious never was
I only meanthat I cant sit alone here I darent Else Im quite
myself So if so be you dont want me any more if I cant be of any
further use to you or toto Mr Lawford Id prefer to go home

Very well Ada thank you You can go out this way

The door was unchained and unbolted and Goodnight said And Sheila
swept back in sombre pomp to her absorbed friends

Shes quite a good creature at heart she explained frankly as if to
disclaim any finesse and almost quixotically loyal But what really
did she mean do you think She is so obstinate That maddening some
one How they do repeat themselves It cant be my husband not Dr
Ferguson I mean You dont supposeoh surely not some one else
Again the dark silence of the house seemed to drift in on the little
company

Mr Craik cleared his throat I failed to catch quite all that the maid
said he murmured apologetically but I certainly did gather it was to
some kind ofof emanation she was referring And the ruin you know
Im not a mystic and yet do you know that somehow seemed to me almost
offensively suggestive ofof demonic influence You dont suppose
Mrs Lawfordand of course I wouldnt for a moment venture on such a
conjecture unsupportedbut even if this restless spirit let us call
it did succeed in making a footing it might possibly be rather in
the nature of a lodging than a permanent residence Moreover we are I
think bound to remember that probably in all spheres of existence like
attracts like even the Gadarene episode seems to suggest a possible
MULTIPLICATION he peered largely You dont suppose Mrs Lawford

I think Mr Craik doesnt quite relish having to break the news Sheila
dear explained Mrs Lovat soothingly that perhaps Sabathiers out
Which really is quite a heavenly suggestion for in that case your
husband would be in wouldnt he Just our old stolid Arthur again you
know And next Mr Craik is suggesting and it certainly does seem rather
fascinating that poor Adas got mixed up with the Frenchmans friends
or perhaps even with one of the seventytwo Princes Royal I know
women cant or mustnt reason Mr Danton but you do I hope just
catch the drift

Danton started I wasnt really listening to the girl he explained
nonchalantly shrugging his black shoulders and pursing up his eyes
Personally Mrs Lovat Id pack the baggage off tonight box and all
But its not my business

You mustnt be depressedmust he Mr Craik After all my dear man
the business as you call it is not exactly entailed But really
Sheila I think it must be getting very late Mr Bethany wont come now
And the dear old thing ought certainly to have his say before we go any
further OUGHTNT he Mr Danton So whats the use of worriting poor
Adas ghost any longer And as for poor ArthurI havent the faintest
desire in the world to hear the little cart drive up simply in case it
should be to leave your unfortunate husband behind it Sheila What
it must be to be alone all night in this house with a dead and buried
Frenchmans facewell I shudder dear

And yet Mrs Lovat said Mr Craik with some little show of returning
bravado as we make our bed you know

But in this case you see she replied reflectively if all accounts
are true Mr Craik its manifestly the wicked Frenchman who has made
the bed and Sheila who refu But look Mr Danton is fretting to get
home

If youll all go to the door said Danton seizing a fleeting
opportunity to raise his eyebrows more expressively even than if he had
again shrugged his shoulders at Sheila Ill put out the light

The night air flowed into the dark house as Danton hastily groped his
way out of the diningroom

Theres only one thing said Sheila slowly When I last saw my
husband you know he was I think the least bit better He was always
stubbornly convinced it would all come right in time Thats why
I think hes been spending hishis evenings away from home But
supposing it did

For my part said Mrs Lovat breathing the faint wind that was rising
out of the west Id sigh Id rub my eyes Id thank God for such an
exciting dream and Id turn comfortably over and go to sleep again Im
all for Arthurabsolutelyback against the wall

For my part said Danton looming in the dusk friend or no friend
Id cut theId cut him dead But dont fret Mrs Lawford devil or no
devil hes gone for good

And for my part began Mr Craik but the door at that moment slammed

Voices however broke out almost immediately in the porch And after
a hurried consultation Lawford in his stagnant retreat heard the door
softly reopen and the striking of a match And Mr Craik followed
closely by Dantons great body stole circumspectly across his dim
chink and the first adventurer went stumbling down the kitchen
staircase

I suppose muttered Lawford turning his head in the darkness they
have come back to put out the kitchen gas

Danton began a busy tuneless whistle between his teeth

Coming Craik he called thickly after a long pause

Apparently no answer had been returned to his inquiry he waited a
little longer with legs apart and eyeballs enveloped in brooding
darkness Ill just go and tell the ladies youre coming he suddenly
bawled down the hollow Do you hear Craik Theyre alone you know
And with that he resolutely wheeled and rapidly made his way down
the steps into the garden Some few moments afterwards Mr Craik shook
himself free of the basement hastened at a spirited trot to rejoin his
companions and in his absence of mind omitted to shut the front door



CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE

Lawford sat on in the darkness and now one sentence and now another of
their talk would repeat itself in his memory in much the same way as
one listlessly turns over an antiquated diary to read here and there a
flattened and almost meaningless sentiment Sometimes a footstep passed
echoing along the path under the trees then his thoughts would leave
him and he would listen and listen till it had died quite out It was
all so very far away And they toothese talkersso very far away as
remote and yet as clear as the characters in a play when they have made
their final bow and have left the curtained stage and one is standing
uncompanioned and nearly the last of the spectators and the lights that
have summoned back reality again are being extinguished It was only by
painful effort of mind that he kept recalling himself to himselfwhy he
was here what it all meant that this was indeed actuality

Yet after all this by now was his customary loneliness there was
little else he desired for the present than the hospitality of the dark
He glanced around him in the clear black stirless air Here and there
it seemed a humped or spindled form held against all comers its passive
place Here and there a tiny faintness of light played Night after
night these chairs and tables kept their blank vigil Why he thought
pleased as an overtired child with the fancy in a sense they were
always alone shut up in a kind of senselessnessjust like us all But
whatwhat he had suddenly risen from his chair to ask himselfwhat
on earth are they alone with No precise answer had been forthcoming to
that question But as in turning in the doorway he looked out into
the night flashing here and there in dark spaces of the sky above
the withering apple leavesthe long dark wall and quiet untrodden
roadwith the tumultuous beating of the starsone thing at least he
was conscious of having learned in these last few days he knew what
kind of a place he was alone IN

It seemed to weave a spell over him to call up a nostalgia he had lost
all remembrance of since childhood And that queer homesickness at
any rate was all Sabathiers doing he thought smiling in his rather
careworn fashion Sabathier It was this mystery bereft now of all
fear and this beauty together that made life the endless changing and
yet changeless thing it was And yet mystery and loveliness alike were
only really appreciable with ones legs as it were dangling down over
into the grave

Just with ones lantern lit on the edge of the whispering unknown and
a reiterated going back out of the solitude into the light and warmth
to the voices and glancing of eyes to say goodbyethat after all was
this life on earth for those who watched as well as acted What if ones
earthly home were emptystill the restless fretted traveller must
tarry for the horrible worst of it is my friend he said as if to
some silent companion listening behind him the worst of it is YOUR
way was just simply solely suicide What was it Herbert had called
it Yes a culdesacblack lofty immensely still and old and
picturesque but none the less merely a contemptible culdesac no
abiding place scarcely even sufficing with its flagstones for a groan
from the fugitive and deluded refugee There was no peace for the
wicked The question of course then came inWas there any peace
anywhere for anybody

He smiled at a sudden odd remembrance of a quiet sardonic old aunt
whom he used to stay with as a child Children should be seen and not
heard she would say peering at him over his favourite pudding

His eyes rested vacantly on the darkling street He fell again into
reverie gigantically brooded over by shapes only imagination dimly
conceived of the remote alleys of his mind astir with a shadowy and
ceaseless traffic which it wasnt at least THIS lifes business to
hearken after or regard And as he stood there in a mysteriously
thronging peaceful solitude such as he had never known before faintly
out of the silence broke the sound of approaching hoofs His heart
seemed to gather itself close a momentary blindness veiled his eyes so
wildly had his blood surged up into cheek and brain He remained caught
up with head slightly inclined listening as with an interminable
tardiness measureless anguished hope died down into nothing in his
mind

Cold and heavy his heart began to beat again as if to catch up those
laggard moments He turned with an infinite revulsion of feeling to look
out on the lamps of the old fly that had drawn up at his gate

He watched incuriously a little old lady rather arduously alight pause
and look up at his darkened windows and after a momentary hesitation
and a word over her shoulder to the cabman stoop and fumble at the iron
latch He watched her with a kind of wondering aversion still scarcely
tinged with curiosity She had succeeded in lifting the latch and in
pushing her way through and was even now steadily advancing towards
him along the tiled path And a minute after he recognised with the
strangest reactions the quiet old figure that had shared a sunset with
him ages and ages agohis mothers old schoolfellow Miss Sinnet

He was already ransacking the still faintlyperfumed diningroom for
matches and had just succeeded in relighting the stillwarm lamp when
he heard her quiet step in the porch even felt her peering in in the
gloom with all her years trickling customariness behind her a little
dubious of knocking on a wideopen door

But the lamp lit Lawford went out again and welcomed his visitor I am
alone he was explaining gravely my wifes away and the whole house
topsyturvy How very very kind of you

The old lady was breathing a little heavily after her ascent of the
steep steps and seemed not to have noticed his outstretched hand None
the less she followed him in and when she was well advanced into the
lighted room she sighed deeply raised her veil over the front of her
bonnet and leisurely took out her spectacles

I suppose she was explaining in a little quiet voice you ARE Mr
Arthur Lawford but as I did not catch sight of a light in any of the
windows I began to fear that the cabman might have set me down at the
wrong house

She raised her head and first through and then over her spectacles she
deliberately and steadfastly regarded him

Yes she said to herself and turned not as it seemed entirely with
satisfaction to look for a chair He wheeled the most comfortable up to
the table

I have been visiting my old friend Miss TuckerRev W Tuckers
daughtershe I knew could give me your address and sure enough she
did Your road dye see was on my way home And I determined in spite
of the hour just to inquire You must understand Mr Lawford there
was something that I rather particularly wanted to say to you But
thereyoure looking sadly sadly ill and she glanced round a
little inquisitively I think my story had better wait for a more
convenient occasion

Not at all Miss Sinnet please not Lawford assured her really I
have been ill but Im now practically quite myself again My wife and
daughter have gone away for a few days and I follow tomorrow so if
youll forgive such a very poor welcome it may be mymy only chance
Do please let me hear

The old lady leant back in her chair placed her hands on its arms and
softly panted while out of the rather broad serenity of her face she
sat blinking up at her companion as if after a long talk instead of
at the beginning of one No she repeated reflectively I dont like
your looks at all yet here we are enjoying beautiful autumn weather
Mr Lawford why not make use of it

Oh yes said Lawford I do I have been making tremendous use of it

Her eyelid flickered at his candid glance And does your business
permit of much walking

Well Ive been malingering these last few days idling at home but I
am usually more or less my own man Miss Sinnet I walk a little

Hm but not much in my direction Mr Lawford she quizzed him

All horrible indolence Miss Sinnet But I oftenoften think of you
and especially just lately

Well now she wriggled round her head to get a better view of him
rather stiffly seated on his chair thats very peculiar because I too
have been thinking lately a great deal of you And yetI fancy I
shall succeed in mystifying you presentlynot precisely of you but of
somebody else

You do mystify mesomebody else he replied gallantly And that is
the story I suppose

Thats the story repeated Miss Sinnet with some little triumph Now
let me see it was on Saturday lastyes Saturday evening a wonderful
sunset Bewley Heath

Oh yes my daughters favourite walk

And your daughters age now

Shes nearly sixteen Alice you know

Ah yes Alice to be sure It is a beautiful walk and if fine I
generally take mine there too Its near theres shade its very
little frequented and I can wander and muse undisturbed And that
I think is pretty well all that an old woman like me is fit for Mr
Lawford Nearly sixteen Is it possible Dear dear me But let me get
on On my way home from the Heath you may be aware before one reaches
the road again theres a somewhat steep ascent I havent the strength
I had and whether Im fatigued or not I have always made it a rule to
rest awhile on a most convenient little seat at the summit admire the
viewwhat I can see of itand then make my way quietly quietly home
On Saturday however and it most rarely occursonce I remember when
a very civil nursemaid was sitting with two charmingly behaved little
children in the sunshine and I heard they were my old friend Major
Loders sons childrenon Saturday as I was saying my own particular
little haunt was already occupied She glanced back at him from out of
her thoughts as it were By a gentleman I say gentleman though I
must confess that his conductperhaps too a little something even in
his appearance somewhat belied the term Anyhow gentleman let us call
him

Lawford all attention nodded and encouragingly smiled

Im not one of those tiresome suspicious people Mr Lawford who
distrust strangers I have never been molested and I have enjoyed many
and many a most interesting and sometimes instructive talk with an
individual whom Ive never seen in my life before and this side of the
grave perhaps am never likely to see again She lifted her head with
pursed lips and gravely yet still flickeringly regarded him once more
Well I made some trifling remarkthe weather the view whatnot
she explained with a little jerk of her shoulderand to my extreme
astonishment he turned and addressed me by nameMiss Sinnet
UnmistakablySinnet Now perhaps and very rightly you wont
considered THAT a very peculiar thing to do But you will recollect Mr
Lawford that I had been sitting there a considerable time Surely now
if you had recognised my face you would have addressed me at once

Was he do you think Miss Sinnet a little uncertain perhaps

Never mind never mind let me get on with my story first The next
thing my gentleman does is more mysterious still His whole manner was
a little peculiar perhapsa certain restlessness what in fact one
might be almost tempted to call a certain furtiveness of behaviour
Never mind What he does next is to ask me a riddle Perhaps you wont
think that was peculiar either

What was the riddle smiled Lawford

Why to be sure to guess his name Simply guided so I surmised
by some very faint resemblance in his face to his MOTHER who was
he assured me an old schoolfellow of mine at BRIGHTON I thought
and thought I confess the adventure was beginning to be a little
perplexing But of course very very few of my old schoolfellows remain
distinctly in my memory now and I fear that grows more treacherous the
longer I live Their faces as girls are clear enough But later in life
most of them drifted out of sightmany alas are dead and well at
last I narrowed my man down to one And who now do you suppose that
was

Lawford sustained an expression of abysmal mystification Do tell
mewho

Your own poor dear mother Mr Lawford

HE said so

No no said the old lady with some vexation closing her eyes I
said so He asked me to guess And I guessed Mary Lawford now do you
see

Yes yes But WAS he like her Miss Sinnet That was really very very
extraordinary Did you see any likeness in his face

Miss Sinnet very deliberately took her spectacles out of their case
again Now see here sir this is being practical isnt it Im just
going to take a leisurely glance at yours But you mustnt let me forget
the time You must look after the time for me

Its about a quarter to ten said Lawford having glanced first at the
stopped clock on the chimneypiece and then at his watch He then sat
quite still and endeavoured to sit at ease while the old lady lifted
her bonneted head and ever so gravely and benignly surveyed him

Hm she said at last Theres no mistaking YOU Its Marys chin
and Marys browwith just a little something perhaps of her dreamy
eye But you havent all her looks Mr Lawford by any manner of means
She was a very beautiful girl and so vivacious so fancifulit was I
suppose the foreign strain showing itself Even marriage did not quite
succeed in spoiling her

The foreign strain Lawford glanced with a kind of fleeting fixity at
the quiet old figure The foreign strain

Your mothers maiden name my dear Mr Lawford surely memory does not
deceive me in that was van der Gucht THAT I believe is a foreign
name

Ah yes said Lawford his rising thoughts sinking quietly to rest
again Van der Gucht of course Ihow stupid of me

As a matter of fact your mother was very proud of her Dutch blood But
there she flung out little finlike sleeves if you dont let me keep
to my story I shall go back as uneasy as I came And you didnt she
added even more fretfully you didnt tell me the time

Lawford stared at his watch again for some few moments without replying
Its a few minutes to ten he said at last

Dear me And Im keeping the cabman I mast hurry on Well now I put
it to you you shall be my father confessorthough I detest the idea in
real lifewas I wrong Was I justified in professing to the poor fellow
that I detected a likeness when there was extremely little likeness
there

What None at all cried Lawford not the faintest trace

My dear good Mr Lawford she expostulated patting her lap theres
very little more than a trace of my dear beautiful Mary in YOU her
own son How could there behow could you expect it in him a complete
stranger No it was nothing but my own foolish kindliness It might
have been Marys son for all that I could recollect I havent for
years please remember had the pleasure of receiving a visit from
YOU I am firmly of opinionthat I was justified My motive was entirely
benevolent And thento my positive amazementwell I wont say hard
things of the absent but he suddenly turns round on me with a Thank
you Miss Bennett Bennett hark ye Perhaps you wont agree that I had
any justification in being vexed andand affronted at THAT

I think Miss Sinnet said Lawford solemnly that you were perfectly
justified Oh perfectly I wonder even you had the patience to give
the real Arthur Lawford a chance to ask your forgiveness foror the
stranger

Well candidly said Miss Sinnett severely I was very much
scandalised and I shouldnt be here now telling you my story if it
hadnt been for your mother

My mother

The old lady rather grimly enjoyed his confusion Yes Mr Lawford
your mother I dont know whysomething in his manner something in
his faceso dejected so unhappy soif it is not uncharitablnesse to
say itso wild it has haunted me I havent been able to put the
matter out of my mind I have lain awake in my bed thinking of him Why
did he speak to me I keep asking myself Why did he play me so very
aimless a trick How had he learned my name Why was he sitting there so
solitary and so dejected And worse even than that what has become of
him A little more patience a little more charity perhapswhat might
I not have done for him The whole thing has harassed and distressed me
more than I can say Would you believe it I have actually twice and on
one occasion three times in a day made my way to the seathoping to
see him there And I am not so young as I was And then as I say to
crown all I had a most remarkable dream about your mother But thats
my own affair Elderly people like me are usedwell perhaps I wont
say usedwere not surprised or disturbed by visits from those who have
gone before We live in a sense among the tombs though I would not
have you fancy its in any way a morbid or unhappy life to lead We
dont talk about itcertainly not to young people Let them enjoy their
Eden while they can though theres plenty of apples I fear on the
Tree yet Mr Lawford

She leant forward and whispered it with a big simple smileWe dont
even discuss it much among ourselves But as one gets nearer and nearer
to the wicketgate theres other company around one than youll find
inin the directory And that is why I have just come on here tonight
Very probably my errand may seem to have no meaning for you You look
ill but you dont appear to be in any great trouble or adversity as I
feared in mywell thereas I feared you might be I must say though
it seems a terribly empty house And no lights too

She slowly with a little trembling nodding of her bonnet turned
her head and glanced quietly fixedly and unflinchingly out of the
halfopen door But thats not my affair And again she looked at him
for a little while

Then she stooped forward and touched him kindly and trustingly on the
knee Trouble or no trouble she said its never too late to remind
a man of his mother And Im sure Mr Lawford Im very glad to hear you
are struggling up out of your illness again We must keep a brave heart
forty or seventy whichever we may be While the evil days come not nor
the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them
though they have not come to me even yet and I trust from the bottom of
my heart not to YOU

She looked at him without a trace of emotion or constraint in her
large quiet face and their eyes met for a moment in that brief fixed
baffling fashion that seems to prove that mankind is after all but a
dumb masked creature saddled with the vain illusion of speech

And now that Ive eased my conscience said the old lady pulling
down her veil I must beg pardon for intruding at such an hour of the
evening And may I have your arm down those dreadful steps Really Mr
Lawford judging from the houses they erect for us the builders must
have a very peculiar notion of mankind Is the fly still there I
expressly told the man to wait and what I am going to do if

Hes there Lawford reassured her craning his neck in their slow
progress to catch a peep into the quiet road And like a flock of birds
scared by a chance comer at their feeding in some deserted field a
whirring cloud of memories swept softly up in his mindmemories whose
import he made no effort to discover None the less the leisurely
descent became in their company something of a real experience even in
such a brimming week

I hope some day you will really tell me your dream he said pushing
the old ladys silk skirts in after her as she slowly climbed into the
carriage

Ah my dear Lawford when you are my age she called back to him
groping her way into the rather musty gloom youll dream such dreams
for yourself Lifes not whats just the fashion And there are queerer
things to be seen and heard just quietly in ones solitude than this
busy life gives us time to discover But as for my mystifying Bewley
acquaintanceI confess I cannot make head or tail of him

Was he said Lawford rather vaguely looking up into the dim white
face that with its plumes filled nearly the whole carriage window was
his face very unpleasing

She raised a gloved hand It has haunted me haunted me Mr Lawford
itsits conflict Poor fellow I hope I do hope he faced his trouble
out But I shall never see him again

He squeezed the trembling kindly old hand I bet Miss Sinnet he
said earnestly even your having thought kindly of the poor beggar
eased his mindwhoever he may have been I assure you assure you of
that

Ay but I did more than THINK replied the old lady with a chuckle
that might have seemed even a little derisive if it had not been so
profoundly magnanimous

He watched the old black fly roll slowly off and still smiling at Miss
Sinnets inscrutable finesse went back into the house And now my
friend he said addressing peacefully the thronging darkness the
times nearly up for me to go too

He had made up his mind Or rather it seemed as if in the unregarded
silences of this last long talk his mind had made up itself Only among
impossibilities had he the shadow of a choice In this old haunted
house amid this shallow turmoil no practicable clue could show itself
of a way out He would go away for a while

He left the door ajar behind him for the moments still left and
stood for a while thinking Then lamp in hand he descended into the
breakfastroom for pen ink and paper He sat for some time in that
underground calm nibbling his pen like a harassed and selfconscious
schoolboy At last he began

MY DEAR SHEILAI must tell you to begin with that the CHANGE has
now all passed away I amas near as man can becompletely myself
again And next that I overheard all that was said tonight in the
diningroom

Im sorry for listening but its no good going over all that now Here
I am and as you said for Alices sake we must make the best of it I
am going away for a while to get if I can a chance to quiet down I
suppose every one comes sooner or later to a time in life when there
is nothing else to be done but just shut ones eyes and blunder on And
thats all I can do nowblunder on

He paused and suddenly at the echo of the words in his mind a
revulsion of feelingshame and hatred of himself surged up and he
tore his letter into tiny pieces Once more he began my dear Sheila
dropped his pen sat on for a long time cold and inert harbouring
almost unendurably a pitiful hopeless longing He would write to
Grisel another day

He leant back in his chair his fingers pressed against his eyelids And
clearer than those which myriadhued reality can ever present pictures
of the imagination swam up before his eyes It seemed indeed that even
now some ghost some revenant of himself was sitting there in the old
green churchyard roofed only with a thousand thousand stars The breath
of darkness stirred softly on his cheek Some little scampering shape
slipped by A bird on high cried weirdly solemnly over the globe He
shuddered faintly and looked out again into the small lamplit room

Here too was quite as inexplicable a coming and going A fly was
walking on the table beneath his eyes with the uneasy gait of one that
has outlived his hour and most of his companions Mice were scampering
and shrieking in the empty kitchen And all about him in the viewless
air the phantoms of another life passed by unmindful of his motionless
body He fell into a lethargy of the senses and only gradually became
aware after a while of the strange longdrawn sigh of rain at the
window He rose and opened it The night air flowed in chilled with its
waters and faintly fragrant of the dust It soothed away all thought for
a while He turned back to his chair He would wait until the rain had
lulled before starting

A little before midnight the door was softly and with extreme care
pushed open and Mr Bethanys old face with an intense and sharpened
scrutiny looked in on the lamplit room And as if still intent on
the least sound within the empty walls around him he came near and
stooping across the table stared through his spectacles at the sidelong
face of his friend so still with hands so lightly laid on the arms of
his chair that the old man had need to watch closely to detect in his
heavy slumber the slow measured rise and fall of his breast

He turned wearily away muttering a little between an immeasurable
relief and a now almost intolerable medley of vexations What WAS
this monstrous web of Craiks What HAD the creature been nodding and
ducketing aboutthose whisperings that tattling And what in the end
when you were old and sour and outstrategied what was the end to be
of this urgent dream called Life He sat quietly down and drew his hands
over his face pushed his lean knotted fingers up under his spectacles
then sat blinkingand softly slowly deciphered the solitary My dear
Sheila on Lawfords notepaper Hm he muttered and looked up again
at the dark still eyelids that in the strange torpor of sleep might yet
be dimly conveying to the dreaming brain behind them some hint of his
presence I wish to goodness you wonderful old creature he muttered
wagging his head I wish to goodness youd wake up

For some time he sat on listening to the still soft downpour on the
fading leaves They dont come to me he said softly again with a
tiny smile on his old face Its that old medieval Craik with a
face like a last years rookery And again he sat with head a little
sidelong listening now to the infinitesimal sounds of life without
now to the thoughts within and ever and again he gazed steadfastly on
Lawford

At last it seemed in the haunted quietness other thoughts came to him
A cloud as it were of youth drew over the wrinkled skin composed the
birdlike keenness his head nodded Once like Lawford in the darkness
at Widderstone he glanced up sharply across the lamplight at
his phantasmagorical shadowy companion heard the steady surge of
multitudinous raindrops like the roar of Times winged chariot
hurrying near then he too with spectacles awry bobbed on in his
chair a weary old sentinel on the outskirts of his friends denuded
battlefield
