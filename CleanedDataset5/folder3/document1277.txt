MELMOTH RECONCILED


There is a special variety of human nature obtained in the Social
Kingdom by a process analogous to that of the gardeners craft in the
Vegetable Kingdom to wit by the forcinghousea species of hybrid
which can be raised neither from seed nor from slips This product is
known as the Cashier an anthropomorphous growth watered by religious
doctrine trained up in fear of the guillotine pruned by vice to
flourish on a third floor with an estimable wife by his side and an
uninteresting family The number of cashiers in Paris must always be
a problem for the physiologist Has any one as yet been able to state
correctly the terms of the proportion sum wherein the cashier figures as
the unknown _x_ Where will you find the man who shall live with wealth
like a cat with a caged mouse This man for further qualification
shall be capable of sitting boxed in behind an iron grating for seven
or eight hours a day during seveneighths of the year perched upon a
caneseated chair in a space as narrow as a lieutenants cabin on board
a manofwar Such a man must be able to defy anchylosis of the knee
and thigh joints he must have a soul above meanness in order to live
meanly must lose all relish for money by dint of handling it Demand
this peculiar specimen of any creed educational system school or
institution you please and select Paris that city of fiery ordeals
and branch establishment of hell as the soil in which to plant the said
cashier So be it Creeds schools institutions and moral systems all
human rules and regulations great and small will one after another
present much the same face that an intimate friend turns upon you when
you ask him to lend you a thousand francs With a dolorous dropping of
the jaw they indicate the guillotine much as your friend aforesaid
will furnish you with the address of the moneylender pointing you to
one of the hundred gates by which a man comes to the last refuge of the
destitute

Yet nature has her freaks in the making of a mans mind she indulges
herself and makes a few honest folk now and again and now and then a
cashier

Wherefore that race of corsairs whom we dignify with the title of
bankers the gentry who take out a license for which they pay a thousand
crowns as the privateer takes out his letters of marque hold these
rare products of the incubations of virtue in such esteem that they
confine them in cages in their countinghouses much as governments
procure and maintain specimens of strange beasts at their own charges

If the cashier is possessed of an imagination or of a fervid
temperament if as will sometimes happen to the most complete cashier
he loves his wife and that wife grows tired of her lot has ambitions
or merely some vanity in her composition the cashier is undone
Search the chronicles of the countinghouse You will not find a single
instance of a cashier attaining _a position_ as it is called They are
sent to the hulks they go to foreign parts they vegetate on a second
floor in the Rue SaintLouis among the market gardens of the Marais
Some day when the cashiers of Paris come to a sense of their real
value a cashier will be hardly obtainable for money Still certain
it is that there are people who are fit for nothing but to be cashiers
just as the bent of a certain order of mind inevitably makes for
rascality But oh marvel of our civilization Society rewards virtue
with an income of a hundred louis in old age a dwelling on a second
floor bread sufficient occasional new bandana handkerchiefs an
elderly wife and her offspring

So much for virtue But for the opposite course a little boldness
a faculty for keeping on the windward side of the law as Turenne
outflanked Montecuculi and Society will sanction the theft of millions
shower ribbons upon the thief cram him with honors and smother him
with consideration

Government moreover works harmoniously with this profoundly illogical
reasonerSociety Government levies a conscription on the young
intelligence of the kingdom at the age of seventeen or eighteen
a conscription of precocious brainwork before it is sent up to be
submitted to a process of selection Nurserymen sort and select seeds
in much the same way To this process the Government brings professional
appraisers of talent men who can assay brains as experts assay gold
at the Mint Five hundred such heads set afire with hope are sent up
annually by the most progressive portion of the population and of these
the Government takes onethird puts them in sacks called the Ecoles
and shakes them up together for three years Though every one of these
young plants represents vast productive power they are made as one
may say into cashiers They receive appointments the rank and file
of engineers is made up of them they are employed as captains of
artillery there is no subaltern grade to which they may not aspire
Finally when these men the pick of the youth of the nation fattened
on mathematics and stuffed with knowledge have attained the age of
fifty years they have their reward and receive as the price of their
services the thirdfloor lodging the wife and family and all the
comforts that sweeten life for mediocrity If from among this race of
dupes there should escape some five or six men of genius who climb the
highest heights is it not miraculous

This is an exact statement of the relations between Talent and Probity
on the one hand and Government and Society on the other in an age that
considers itself to be progressive Without this prefatory explanation
a recent occurrence in Paris would seem improbable but preceded by this
summing up of the situation it will perhaps receive some thoughtful
attention from minds capable of recognizing the real plaguespots of
our civilization a civilization which since 1815 as been moved by the
spirit of gain rather than by principles of honor



About five oclock on a dull autumn afternoon the cashier of one of
the largest banks in Paris was still at his desk working by the light
of a lamp that had been lit for some time In accordance with the use
and wont of commerce the countinghouse was in the darkest corner of
the lowceiled and far from spacious mezzanine floor and at the very
end of a passage lighted only by borrowed lights The office doors
along this corridor each with its label gave the place the look of a
bathhouse At four oclock the stolid porter had proclaimed according
to his orders The bank is closed And by this time the departments
were deserted wives of the partners in the firm were expecting their
lovers the two bankers dining with their mistresses Everything was in
order

The place where the strong boxes had been bedded in sheetiron was just
behind the little sanctum where the cashier was busy Doubtless he was
balancing his books The open front gave a glimpse of a safe of hammered
iron so enormously heavy thanks to the science of the modern inventor
that burglars could not carry it away The door only opened at the
pleasure of those who knew its password The letterlock was a warden
who kept its own secret and could not be bribed the mysterious word was
an ingenious realization of the Open sesame in the _Arabian Nights_
But even this was as nothing A man might discover the password but
unless he knew the locks final secret the _ultima ratio_ of this
goldguarding dragon of mechanical science it discharged a blunderbuss
at his head

The door of the room the walls of the room the shutters of the windows
in the room the whole place in fact was lined with sheetiron a third
of an inch in thickness concealed behind the thin wooden paneling The
shutters had been closed the door had been shut If ever man could feel
confident that he was absolutely alone and that there was no remote
possibility of being watched by prying eyes that man was the cashier of
the house of Nucingen and Company in the Rue SaintLazare

Accordingly the deepest silence prevailed in that iron cave The fire
had died out in the stove but the room was full of that tepid warmth
which produces the dull heavyheadedness and nauseous queasiness of a
morning after an orgy The stove is a mesmerist that plays no small part
in the reduction of bank clerks and porters to a state of idiocy

A room with a stove in it is a retort in which the power of strong
men is evaporated where their vitality is exhausted and their wills
enfeebled Government offices are part of a great scheme for the
manufacture of the mediocrity necessary for the maintenance of a Feudal
System on a pecuniary basisand money is the foundation of the Social
Contract See _Les Employes_ The mephitic vapors in the atmosphere
of a crowded room contribute in no small degree to bring about a gradual
deterioration of intelligences the brain that gives off the largest
quantity of nitrogen asphyxiates the others in the long run

The cashier was a man of fiveandforty or thereabouts As he sat at the
table the light from a moderator lamp shining full on his bald head and
glistening fringe of irongray hair that surrounded itthis baldness
and the round outlines of his face made his head look very like a ball
His complexion was brickred a few wrinkles had gathered about his
eyes but he had the smooth plump hands of a stout man His blue cloth
coat a little rubbed and worn and the creases and shininess of his
trousers traces of hard wear that the clothesbrush fails to remove
would impress a superficial observer with the idea that here was a
thrifty and upright human being sufficient of the philosopher or of the
aristocrat to wear shabby clothes But unluckily it is easy to find
pennywise people who will prove weak wasteful or incompetent in the
capital things of life

The cashier wore the ribbon of the Legion of Honor at his buttonhole
for he had been a major of dragoons in the time of the Emperor M de
Nucingen who had been a contractor before he became a banker had had
reason in those days to know the honorable disposition of his cashier
who then occupied a high position Reverses of fortune had befallen the
major and the banker out of regard for him paid him five hundred francs
a month The soldier had become a cashier in the year 1813 after his
recovery from a wound received at Studzianka during the Retreat from
Moscow followed by six months of enforced idleness at Strasbourg
whither several officers had been transported by order of the Emperor
that they might receive skilled attention This particular officer
Castanier by name retired with the honorary grade of colonel and a
pension of two thousand four hundred francs

In ten years time the cashier had completely effaced the soldier
and Castanier inspired the banker with such trust in him that he was
associated in the transactions that went on in the private office behind
his little countinghouse The baron himself had access to it by means
of a secret staircase There matters of business were decided It was
the boltingroom where proposals were sifted the privy council chamber
where the reports of the money market were analyzed circular notes
issued thence and finally the private ledger and the journal which
summarized the work of all the departments were kept there

Castanier had gone himself to shut the door which opened on to a
staircase that led to the parlor occupied by the two bankers on the
first floor of their hotel This done he had sat down at his desk
again and for a moment he gazed at a little collection of letters of
credit drawn on the firm of Watschildine of London Then he had taken
up the pen and imitated the bankers signature on each _Nucingen_ he
wrote and eyed the forged signatures critically to see which seemed the
most perfect copy

Suddenly he looked up as if a needle had pricked him You are not
alone a boding voice seemed to cry in his heart and indeed the forger
saw a man standing at the little grated window of the countinghouse a
man whose breathing was so noiseless that he did not seem to breathe at
all Castanier looked and saw that the door at the end of the passage
was wide open the stranger must have entered by that way

For the first time in his life the old soldier felt a sensation of dread
that made him stare openmouthed and wideeyed at the man before him
and for that matter the appearance of the apparition was sufficiently
alarming even if unaccompanied by the mysterious circumstances of so
sudden an entry The rounded forehead the harsh coloring of the long
oval face indicated quite as plainly as the cut of his clothes that the
man was an Englishman reeking of his native isles You had only to look
at the collar of his overcoat at the voluminous cravat which smothered
the crushed frills of a shirt front so white that it brought out the
changeless leaden hue of an impassive face and the thin red line of the
lips that seemed made to suck the blood of corpses and you can guess
at once at the black gaiters buttoned up to the knee and the
halfpuritanical costume of a wealthy Englishman dressed for a walking
excursion The intolerable glitter of the strangers eyes produced a
vivid and unpleasant impression which was only deepened by the rigid
outlines of his features The driedup emaciated creature seemed to
carry within him some gnawing thought that consumed him and could not be
appeased

He must have digested his food so rapidly that he could doubtless
eat continually without bringing any trace of color into his face or
features A tun of Tokay _vin de succession_ would not have caused any
faltering in that piercing glance that read mens inmost thoughts nor
dethroned the merciless reasoning faculty that always seemed to go
to the bottom of things There was something of the fell and tranquil
majesty of a tiger about him

I have come to cash this bill of exchange sir he said Castanier
felt the tones of his voice thrill through every nerve with a violent
shock similar to that given by a discharge of electricity

The safe is closed said Castanier

It is open said the Englishman looking round the countinghouse
Tomorrow is Sunday and I cannot wait The amount is for five hundred
thousand francs You have the money there and I must have it

But how did you come in sir

The Englishman smiled That smile frightened Castanier No words could
have replied more fully nor more peremptorily than that scornful and
imperial curl of the strangers lips Castanier turned away took up
fifty packets each containing ten thousand francs in banknotes and
held them out to the stranger receiving in exchange for them a bill
accepted by the Baron de Nucingen A sort of convulsive tremor ran
through him as he saw a red gleam in the strangers eyes when they fell
on the forged signature on the letter of credit

It it wants your signature stammered Castanier handing back the
bill

Hand me your pen answered the Englishman

Castanier handed him the pen with which he had just committed forgery
The stranger wrote _John Melmoth_ then he returned the slip of paper
and the pen to the cashier Castanier looked at the handwriting
noticing that it sloped from right to left in the Eastern fashion and
Melmoth disappeared so noiselessly that when Castanier looked up again
an exclamation broke from him partly because the man was no longer
there partly because he felt a strange painful sensation such as our
imagination might take for an effect of poison

The pen that Melmoth had handled sent the same sickening heat through
him that an emetic produces But it seemed impossible to Castanier
that the Englishman should have guessed his crime His inward qualms he
attributed to the palpitation of the heart that according to received
ideas was sure to follow at once on such a turn as the stranger had
given him

The devil take it I am very stupid Providence is watching over me
for if that brute had come round to see my gentleman tomorrow my goose
would have been cooked said Castanier and he burned the unsuccessful
attempts at forgery in the stove

He put the bill that he meant to take with him in an envelope and
helped himself to five hundred thousand francs in French and English
banknotes from the safe which he locked Then he put everything in
order lit a candle blew out the lamp took up his hat and umbrella
and went out sedately as usual to leave one of the two keys of the
strong room with Madame de Nucingen in the absence of her husband the
Baron

You are in luck M Castanier said the bankers wife as he entered
the room we have a holiday on Monday you can go into the country or
to Soizy

Madame will you be so good as to tell your husband that the bill
of exchange on Watschildine which was behind time has just been
presented The five hundred thousand francs have been paid so I shall
not come back till noon on Tuesday

Goodbye monsieur I hope you will have a pleasant time

The same to you madame replied the old dragoon as he went out He
glanced as he spoke at a young man well known in fashionable society at
that time a M de Rastignac who was regarded as Madame de Nucingens
lover

Madame remarked this latter the old boy looks to me as if he meant
to play you some ill turn

Pshaw impossible he is too stupid



Piquoizeau said the cashier walking into the porters room what
made you let anybody come up after four oclock

I have been smoking a pipe here in the doorway ever since four
oclock said the man and nobody has gone into the bank Nobody has
come out either except the gentlemen

Are you quite sure

Yes upon my word and honor Stay though at four oclock M
Werbrusts friend came a young fellow from Messrs du Tillet  Co in
the Rue Joubert

All right said Castanier and he hurried away

The sickening sensation of heat that he had felt when he took back the
pen returned in greater intensity _Mille diables_ thought he as he
threaded his way along the Boulevard de Gand havent I taken proper
precautions Let me think Two clear days Sunday and Monday then a day
of uncertainty before they begin to look for me altogether three days
and four nights respite I have a couple of passports and two different
disguises is not that enough to throw the cleverest detective off the
scent On Tuesday morning I shall draw a million francs in London before
the slightest suspicion has been aroused My debts I am leaving behind
for the benefit of my creditors who will put a P on the bills and
I shall live comfortably in Italy for the rest of my days as the Conte
Ferraro Protested I was alone with him when he died poor fellow
in the marsh of Zembin and I shall slip into his skin _Mille
diables_ the woman who is to follow after me might give them a clue
Think of an old campaigner like me infatuated enough to tie myself to a
petticoat tail Why take her I must leave her behind Yes I could
make up my mind to it butI know myselfI should be ass enough to
go back to her Still nobody knows Aquilina Shall I take her or leave
her

You will not take her cried a voice that filled Castanier with
sickening dread He turned sharply and saw the Englishman

The devil is in it cried the cashier aloud

Melmoth had passed his victim by this time and if Castaniers first
impulse had been to fasten a quarrel on a man who read his own thoughts
he was so much torn up by opposing feelings that the immediate result
was a temporary paralysis When he resumed his walk he fell once more
into that fever of irresolution which besets those who are so carried
away by passion that they are ready to commit a crime but have not
sufficient strength of character to keep it to themselves without
suffering terribly in the process So although Castanier had made up
his mind to reap the fruits of a crime which was already half executed
he hesitated to carry out his designs For him as for many men of mixed
character in whom weakness and strength are equally blended the least
trifling consideration determines whether they shall continue to lead
blameless lives or become actively criminal In the vast masses of
men enrolled in Napoleons armies there are many who like Castanier
possessed the purely physical courage demanded on the battlefield yet
lacked the moral courage which makes a man as great in crime as he could
have been in virtue

The letter of credit was drafted in such terms that immediately on
his arrival he might draw twentyfive thousand pounds on the firm of
Watschildine the London correspondents of the house of Nucingen The
London house had already been advised of the draft about to be made upon
them he had written to them himself He had instructed an agent chosen
at random to take his passage in a vessel which was to leave Portsmouth
with a wealthy English family on board who were going to Italy and
the passagemoney had been paid in the name of the Conte Ferraro The
smallest details of the scheme had been thought out He had arranged
matters so as to divert the search that would be made for him into
Belgium and Switzerland while he himself was at sea in the English
vessel Then by the time that Nucingen might flatter himself that he
was on the track of his late cashier the said cashier as the Conte
Ferraro hoped to be safe in Naples He had determined to disfigure his
face in order to disguise himself the more completely and by means of
an acid to imitate the scars of smallpox Yet in spite of all these
precautions which surely seemed as if they must secure him complete
immunity his conscience tormented him he was afraid The even and
peaceful life that he had led for so long had modified the morality of
the camp His life was stainless as yet he could not sully it without a
pang So for the last time he abandoned himself to all the influences of
the better self that strenuously resisted

Pshaw he said at last at the corner of the Boulevard and the Rue
Montmartre I will take a cab after the play this evening and go out to
Versailles A postchaise will be ready for me at my old quartermasters
place He would keep my secret even if a dozen men were standing ready
to shoot him down The chances are all in my favor so far as I see so
I shall take my little Naqui with me and I will go

You will not go exclaimed the Englishman and the strange tones of
his voice drove all the cashiers blood back to his heart

Melmoth stepped into a tilbury which was waiting for him and was
whirled away so quickly that when Castanier looked up he saw his foe
some hundred paces away from him and before it even crossed his mind
to cut off the mans retreat the tilbury was far on its way up the
Boulevard Montmartre

Well upon my word there is something supernatural about this said
he to himself If I were fool enough to believe in God I should think
that He had set Saint Michael on my tracks Suppose that the devil and
the police should let me go on as I please so as to nab me in the nick
of time Did any one ever see the like But there this is folly

Castanier went along the Rue du FaubourgMontmartre slackening his pace
as he neared the Rue Richer There on the second floor of a block of
buildings which looked out upon some gardens lived the unconscious cause
of Castaniers crimea young woman known in the quarter as Mme de la
Garde A concise history of certain events in the cashiers past life
must be given in order to explain these facts and to give a complete
presentment of the crisis when he yielded to temptation

Mme de la Garde said that she was a Piedmontese No one not even
Castanier knew her real name She was one of those young girls who
are driven by dire misery by inability to earn a living or by fear of
starvation to have recourse to a trade which most of them loathe many
regard with indifference and some few follow in obedience to the laws
of their constitution But on the brink of the gulf of prostitution in
Paris the young girl of sixteen beautiful and pure as the Madonna had
met with Castanier The old dragoon was too rough and homely to make his
way in society and he was tired of tramping the boulevard at night and
of the kind of conquests made there by gold For some time past he had
desired to bring a certain regularity into an irregular life He was
struck by the beauty of the poor child who had drifted by chance into
his arms and his determination to rescue her from the life of the
streets was half benevolent half selfish as some of the thoughts of
the best of men are apt to be Social conditions mingle elements of evil
with the promptings of natural goodness of heart and the mixture
of motives underlying a mans intentions should be leniently judged
Castanier had just cleverness enough to be very shrewd where his own
interests were concerned So he concluded to be a philanthropist on
either count and at first made her his mistress

Hey hey he said to himself in his soldierly fashion I am an
old wolf and a sheep shall not make a fool of me Castanier old man
before you set up housekeeping reconnoitre the girls character for a
bit and see if she is a steady sort

This irregular union gave the Piedmontese a status the most nearly
approaching respectability among those which the world declines to
recognize During the first year she took the _nom de guerre_ of
Aquilina one of the characters in _Venice Preserved_ which she had
chanced to read She fancied that she resembled the courtesan in face
and general appearance and in a certain precocity of heart and brain of
which she was conscious When Castanier found that her life was as
well regulated and virtuous as was possible for a social outlaw he
manifested a desire that they should live as husband and wife So she
took the name of Mme de la Garde in order to approach as closely as
Parisian usages permit the conditions of a real marriage As a matter
of fact many of these unfortunate girls have one fixed idea to be
looked upon as respectable middleclass women who lead humdrum lives of
faithfulness to their husbands women who would make excellent mothers
keepers of household accounts and menders of household linen This
longing springs from a sentiment so laudable that society should take
it into consideration But society incorrigible as ever will assuredly
persist in regarding the married woman as a corvette duly authorized by
her flag and papers to go on her own course while the woman who is a
wife in all but name is a pirate and an outlaw for lack of a document
A day came when Mme de la Garde would fain have signed herself Mme
Castanier The cashier was put out by this

So you do not love me well enough to marry me she said

Castanier did not answer he was absorbed by his thoughts The poor girl
resigned herself to her fate The exdragoon was in despair Naquis
heart softened towards him at the sight of his trouble she tried to
soothe him but what could she do when she did not know what ailed him
When Naqui made up her mind to know the secret although she never asked
him a question the cashier dolefully confessed to the existence of a
Mme Castanier This lawful wife a thousand times accursed was living
in a humble way in Strasbourg on a small property there he wrote to her
twice a year and kept the secret of her existence so well that no one
suspected that he was married The reason of this reticence If it
is familiar to many military men who may chance to be in a like
predicament it is perhaps worth while to give the story

Your genuine trooper if it is allowable here to employ the word which
in the army signifies a man who is destined to die as a captain is a
sort of serf a part and parcel of his regiment an essentially simple
creature and Castanier was marked out by nature as a victim to the
wiles of mothers with grownup daughters left too long on their hands
It was at Nancy during one of those brief intervals of repose when the
Imperial armies were not on active service abroad that Castanier was so
unlucky as to pay some attention to a young lady with whom he danced at
a _ridotto_ the provincial name for the entertainments often given
by the military to the townsfolk or vice versa in garrison towns A
scheme for inveigling the gallant captain into matrimony was immediately
set on foot one of those schemes by which mothers secure accomplices in
a human heart by touching all its motive springs while they convert all
their friends into fellowconspirators Like all people possessed by
one idea these ladies press everything into the service of their great
project slowly elaborating their toils much as the antlion excavates
its funnel in the sand and lies in wait at the bottom for its victim
Suppose that no one strays after all into that carefully constructed
labyrinth Suppose that the antlion dies of hunger and thirst in her
pit Such things may be but if any heedless creature once enters in it
never comes out All the wires which could be pulled to induce action
on the captains part were tried appeals were made to the secret
interested motives that always come into play in such cases they worked
on Castaniers hopes and on the weaknesses and vanity of human nature
Unluckily he had praised the daughter to her mother when he brought her
back after a waltz a little chat followed and then an invitation in
the most natural way in the world Once introduced into the house
the dragoon was dazzled by the hospitality of a family who appeared
to conceal their real wealth beneath a show of careful economy He was
skilfully flattered on all sides and every one extolled for his benefit
the various treasures there displayed A neatly timed dinner served on
plate lent by an uncle the attention shown to him by the only daughter
of the house the gossip of the town a welltodo sublieutenant who
seemed likely to cut the ground from under his feetall the innumerable
snares in short of the provincial antlion were set for him and to
such good purpose that Castanier said five years later To this day I
do not know how it came about

The dragoon received fifteen thousand francs with the lady who after
two years of marriage became the ugliest and consequently the
most peevish woman on earth Luckily they had no children The fair
complexion maintained by a Spartan regimen the fresh bright color
in her face which spoke of an engaging modesty became overspread with
blotches and pimples her figure which had seemed so straight grew
crooked the angel became a suspicious and shrewish creature who drove
Castanier frantic Then the fortune took to itself wings At length the
dragoon no longer recognizing the woman whom he had wedded left her to
live on a little property at Strasbourg until the time when it should
please God to remove her to adorn Paradise She was one of those
virtuous women who for want of other occupation would weary the life
out of an angel with complainings who pray till if their prayers are
heard in heaven they must exhaust the patience of the Almighty and say
everything that is bad of their husbands in dovelike murmurs over a game
of boston with their neighbors When Aquilina learned all these troubles
she clung still more affectionately to Castanier and made him so happy
varying with womans ingenuity the pleasures with which she filled his
life that all unwittingly she was the cause of the cashiers downfall

Like many women who seem by nature destined to sound all the depths of
love Mme de la Garde was disinterested She asked neither for gold
nor for jewelry gave no thought to the future lived entirely for the
present and for the pleasures of the present She accepted expensive
ornaments and dresses the carriage so eagerly coveted by women of
her class as one harmony the more in the picture of life There was
absolutely no vanity in her desire not to appear at a better advantage
but to look the fairer and moreover no woman could live without
luxuries more cheerfully When a man of generous nature and military
men are mostly of this stamp meets with such a woman he feels a sort
of exasperation at finding himself her debtor in generosity He feels
that he could stop a mail coach to obtain money for her if he has not
sufficient for her whims He will commit a crime if so he may be great
and noble in the eyes of some woman or of his special public such
is the nature of the man Such a lover is like a gambler who would be
dishonored in his own eyes if he did not repay the sum he borrowed from
a waiter in a gaminghouse but will shrink from no crime will leave
his wife and children without a penny and rob and murder if so he
may come to the gamingtable with a full purse and his honor remain
untarnished among the frequenters of that fatal abode So it was with
Castanier

He had begun by installing Aquiline is a modest fourthfloor dwelling
the furniture being of the simplest kind But when he saw the girls
beauty and great qualities when he had known inexpressible and
unlookedfor happiness with her he began to dote upon her and longed
to adorn his idol Then Aquilinas toilette was so comically out of
keeping with her poor abode that for both their sakes it was clearly
incumbent on him to move The change swallowed up almost all Castaniers
savings for he furnished his domestic paradise with all the prodigality
that is lavished on a kept mistress A pretty woman must have everything
pretty about her the unity of charm in the woman and her surroundings
singles her out from among her sex This sentiment of homogeneity
indeed though it has frequently escaped the attention of observers
is instinctive in human nature and the same prompting leads elderly
spinsters to surround themselves with dreary relics of the past But
the lovely Piedmontese must have the newest and latest fashions and
all that was daintiest and prettiest in stuffs for hangings in silks
or jewelry in fine china and other brittle and fragile wares She
asked for nothing but when she was called upon to make a choice when
Castanier asked her Which do you like she would answer Why this
is the nicest Love never counts the cost and Castanier therefore
always took the nicest

When once the standard had been set up there was nothing for it but
everything in the household must be in conformity from the linen
plate and crystal through a thousand and one items of expenditure down
to the pots and pans in the kitchen Castanier had meant to do things
simply as the saying goes but he gradually found himself more and
more in debt One expense entailed another The clock called for
candle sconces Fires must be lighted in the ornamental grates but the
curtains and hangings were too fresh and delicate to be soiled by smuts
so they must be replaced by patent and elaborate fireplaces warranted
to give out no smoke recent inventions of the people who are so clever
at drawing up a prospectus Then Aquilina found it so nice to run about
barefooted on the carpet in her room that Castanier must have soft
carpets laid everywhere for the pleasure of playing with Naqui A
bathroom too was built for her everything to the end that she might
be more comfortable

Shopkeepers workmen and manufacturers in Paris have a mysterious knack
of enlarging a hole in a mans purse They cannot give the price of
anything upon inquiry and as the paroxysm of longing cannot abide
delay orders are given by the feeble light of an approximate estimate
of cost The same people never send in the bills at once but ply the
purchaser with furniture till his head spins Everything is so pretty
so charming and every one is satisfied

A few months later the obliging furniture dealers are metamorphosed and
reappear in the shape of alarming totals on invoices that fill the soul
with their horrid clamor they are in urgent want of the money they
are as you may say on the brink of bankruptcy their tears flow it
is heartrending to hear them And thenthe gulf yawns and gives up
serried columns of figures marching four deep when as a matter of fact
they should have issued innocently three by three

Before Castanier had any idea of how much he had spent he had arranged
for Aquilina to have a carriage from a livery stable when she went out
instead of a cab Castanier was a gourmand he engaged an excellent
cook and Aquilina to please him had herself made the purchases of
early fruit and vegetables rare delicacies and exquisite wines But
as Aquilina had nothing of her own these gifts of hers so precious by
reason of the thought and tact and graciousness that prompted them were
no less a drain upon Castaniers purse he did not like his Naqui to
be without money and Naqui could not keep money in her pocket So the
table was a heavy item of expenditure for a man with Castaniers income
The exdragoon was compelled to resort to various shifts for obtaining
money for he could not bring himself to renounce this delightful life
He loved the woman too well to cross the freaks of the mistress He
was one of those men who through selflove or through weakness of
character can refuse nothing to a woman false shame overpowers them
and they rather face ruin than make the admissions I cannot My
means will not permit I cannot afford

When therefore Castanier saw that if he meant to emerge from the abyss
of debt into which he had plunged he must part with Aquilina and live
upon bread and water he was so unable to do without her or to change
his habits of life that daily he put off his plans of reform until the
morrow The debts were pressing and he began by borrowing money His
position and previous character inspired confidence and of this he took
advantage to devise a system of borrowing money as he required it Then
as the total amount of debt rapidly increased he had recourse to those
commercial inventions known as accommodation bills This form of bill
does not represent goods or other value received and the first endorser
pays the amount named for the obliging person who accepts it This
species of fraud is tolerated because it is impossible to detect it
and moreover it is an imaginary fraud which only becomes real if
payment is ultimately refused

When at length it was evidently impossible to borrow any longer whether
because the amount of the debt was now so greatly increased or
because Castanier was unable to pay the large amount of interest on
the aforesaid sums of money the cashier saw bankruptcy before him On
making this discovery he decided for a fraudulent bankruptcy rather
than an ordinary failure and preferred a crime to a misdemeanor He
determined after the fashion of the celebrated cashier of the Royal
Treasury to abuse the trust deservedly won and to increase the number
of his creditors by making a final loan of the sum sufficient to keep
him in comfort in a foreign country for the rest of his days All this
as has been seen he had prepared to do

Aquilina knew nothing of the irksome cares of this life she enjoyed her
existence as many a woman does making no inquiry as to where the
money came from even as sundry other folk will eat their buttered rolls
untroubled by any restless spirit of curiosity as to the culture and
growth of wheat but as the labor and miscalculations of agriculture
lie on the other side of the bakers oven so beneath the unappreciated
luxury of many a Parisian household lie intolerable anxieties and
exorbitant toil

While Castanier was enduring the torture of the strain and his thoughts
were full of the deed that should change his whole life Aquilina was
lying luxuriously back in a great armchair by the fireside beguiling
the time by chatting with her waitingmaid As frequently happens in
such cases the maid had become the mistress confidant Jenny having
first assured herself that her mistress ascendency over Castanier was
complete

What are we to do this evening Leon seems determined to come Mme
de la Garde was saying as she read a passionate epistle indited upon a
faint gray notepaper

Here is the master said Jenny

Castanier came in Aquilina nowise disconcerted crumpled up the
letter took it with the tongs and held it in the flames

So that is what you do with your loveletters is it asked Castanier

Oh goodness yes said Aquilina is it not the best way of keeping
them safe Besides fire should go to fire as water makes for the
river

You are talking as if it were a real loveletter Naqui

Well am I not handsome enough to receive them she said holding up
her forehead for a kiss There was a carelessness in her manner that
would have told any man less blind than Castanier that it was only a
piece of conjugal duty as it were to give this joy to the cashier but
use and wont had brought Castanier to the point where clearsightedness
is no longer possible for love

I have taken a box at the Gymnase this evening he said let us have
dinner early and then we need not dine in a hurry

Go and take Jenny I am tired of plays I do not know what is the
matter with me this evening I would rather stay here by the fire

Come all the same though Naqui I shall not be here to bore you much
longer Yes Quiqui I am going to start tonight and it will be some
time before I come back again I am leaving everything in your charge
Will you keep your heart for me too

Neither my heart nor anything else she said but when you come back
again Naqui will still be Naqui for you

Well this is frankness So you would not follow me

No

Why not

Eh why how can I leave the lover who writes me such sweet little
notes she asked pointing to the blackened scrap of paper with a
mocking smile

Is there any truth in it asked Castanier Have you really a lover

Really cried Aquilina and have you never given it a serious
thought dear To begin with you are fifty years old Then you have
just the sort of face to put on a fruit stall if the woman tried to see
you for a pumpkin no one would contradict her You puff and blow like a
seal when you come upstairs your paunch rises and falls like a diamond
on a womans forehead It is pretty plain that you served in the
dragoons you are a very uglylooking old man Fiddlededee If you
have any mind to keep my respect I recommend you not to add imbecility
to these qualities by imagining that such a girl as I am will be content
with your asthmatic love and not look for youth and good looks and
pleasure by way of a variety

Aquilina you are laughing of course

Oh very well and are you not laughing too Do you take me for a fool
telling me that you are going away I am going to start tonight she
said mimicking his tones Stuff and nonsense Would you talk like that
if you were really going from your Naqui You would cry like the booby
that you are

After all if I go will you follow he asked

Tell me first whether this journey of yours is a bad joke or not

Yes seriously I am going

Well then seriously I shall stay A pleasant journey to you my boy
I will wait till you come back I would sooner take leave of life than
take leave of my dear cozy Paris

Will you not come to Italy to Naples and lead a pleasant life
therea delicious luxurious life with this stout old fogy of yours
who puffs and blows like a seal

No

Ungrateful girl

Ungrateful she cried rising to her feet I might leave this house
this moment and take nothing out of it but myself I shall have given
you all the treasures a young girl can give and something that not
every drop in your veins and mine can ever give me back If by any
means whatever by selling my hopes of eternity for instance I could
recover my past self body and soul for I have perhaps redeemed
my soul and be pure as a lily for my lover I would not hesitate a
moment What sort of devotion has rewarded mine You have housed and fed
me just as you give a dog food and a kennel because he is a protection
to the house and he may take kicks when we are out of humor and lick
our hands as soon as we are pleased to call him And which of us two
will have been the more generous

Oh dear child do you not see that I am joking returned Castanier
I am going on a short journey I shall not be away for very long But
come with me to the Gymnase I shall start just before midnight after I
have had time to say goodbye to you

Poor pet so you are really going are you she said She put her arms
round his neck and drew down his head against her bodice

You are smothering me cried Castanier with his face buried in
Aquilinas breast That damsel turned to say in Jennys ear Go to
Leon and tell him not to come till one oclock If you do not find
him and he comes here during the leavetaking keep him in your
roomWell she went on setting free Castanier and giving a tweak
to the tip of his nose never mind handsomest of seals that you are I
will go to the theatre with you this evening But all in good time let
us have dinner There is a nice little dinner for youjust what you
like

It is very hard to part from such a woman as you exclaimed Castanier

Very well then why do you go asked she

Ah why why If I were to begin to begin to explain the reasons why
I must tell you things that would prove to you that I love you almost to
madness Ah if you have sacrificed your honor for me I have sold mine
for you we are quits Is that love

What is all this about said she Come now promise me that if I had
a lover you would still love me as a father that would be love Come
now promise it at once and give us your fist upon it

I should kill you and Castanier smiled as he spoke

They sat down to the dinner table and went thence to the Gymnase When
the first part of the performance was over it occurred to Castanier to
show himself to some of his acquaintances in the house so as to turn
away any suspicion of his departure He left Mme de la Garde in the
corner box where she was seated according to her modest wont and went
to walk up and down in the lobby He had not gone many paces before he
saw the Englishman and with a sudden return of the sickening sensation
of heat that once before had vibrated through him and of the terror
that he had felt already he stood face to face with Melmoth

Forger

At the word Castanier glanced round at the people who were moving about
them He fancied that he could see astonishment and curiosity in their
eyes and wishing to be rid of this Englishman at once he raised his
hand to strike himand felt his arm paralyzed by some invisible power
that sapped his strength and nailed him to the spot He allowed the
stranger to take him by the arm and they walked together to the
greenroom like two friends

Who is strong enough to resist me said the Englishman addressing
him Do you not know that everything here on earth must obey me that
it is in my power to do everything I read mens thoughts I see the
future and I know the past I am here and I can be elsewhere also
Time and space and distance are nothing to me The whole world is at
my beck and call I have the power of continual enjoyment and of giving
joy I can see through walls discover hidden treasures and fill my
hands with them Palaces arise at my nod and my architect makes no
mistakes I can make all lands break forth into blossom heap up their
gold and precious stones and surround myself with fair women and ever
new faces everything is yielded up to my will I could gamble on the
Stock Exchange and my speculations would be infallible but a man
who can find the hoards that misers have hidden in the earth need not
trouble himself about stocks Feel the strength of the hand that grasps
you poor wretch doomed to shame Try to bend the arm of iron try to
soften the adamantine heart Fly from me if you dare You would hear
my voice in the depths of the caves that lie under the Seine you might
hide in the Catacombs but would you not see me there My voice could
be heard through the sound of thunder my eyes shine as brightly as the
sun for I am the peer of Lucifer

Castanier heard the terrible words and felt no protest nor
contradiction within himself He walked side by side with the
Englishman and had no power to leave him

You are mine you have just committed a crime I have found at last the
mate whom I have sought Have you a mind to learn your destiny Aha
you came here to see a play and you shall see a playnay two Come
Present me to Mme de la Garde as one of your best friends Am I not
your last hope of escape

Castanier followed by the stranger returned to his box and in
accordance with the order he had just received he hastened to introduce
Melmoth to Mme de la Garde Aquilina seemed to be not in the least
surprised The Englishman declined to take a seat in front and
Castanier was once more beside his mistress the mans slightest wish
must be obeyed The last piece was about to begin for at that time
small theatres gave only three pieces One of the actors had made the
Gymnase the fashion and that evening Perlet the actor in question
was to play in a vaudeville called _Le Comedien dEtampes_ in which he
filled four different parts

When the curtain rose the stranger stretched out his hand over the
crowded house Castaniers cry of terror died away for the walls of his
throat seemed glued together as Melmoth pointed to the stage and the
cashier knew that the play had been changed at the Englishmans desire

He saw the strongroom at the bank he saw the Baron de Nucingen in
conference with a policeofficer from the Prefecture who was informing
him of Castaniers conduct explaining that the cashier had absconded
with money taken from the safe giving the history of the forged
signature The information was put in writing the document signed and
duly despatched to the Public Prosecutor

Are we in time do you think asked Nucingen

Yes said the agent of police he is at the Gymnase and has no
suspicion of anything

Castanier fidgeted on his chair and made as if he would leave the
theatre but Melmoths hand lay on his shoulder and he was obliged to
sit and watch the hideous power of the man produced an effect like that
of nightmare and he could not move a limb Nay the man himself was the
nightmare his presence weighed heavily on his victim like a poisoned
atmosphere When the wretched cashier turned to implore the Englishmans
mercy he met those blazing eyes that discharged electric currents
which pierced through him and transfixed him like darts of steel

What have I done to you he said in his prostrate helplessness and
he breathed hard like a stag at the waters edge What do you want of
me

Look cried Melmoth

Castanier looked at the stage The scene had been changed The play
seemed to be over and Castanier beheld himself stepping from the
carriage with Aquilina but as he entered the courtyard of the house on
the Rue Richer the scene again was suddenly changed and he saw his
own house Jenny was chatting by the fire in her mistress room with a
subaltern officer of a line regiment then stationed at Paris

He is going is he said the sergeant who seemed to belong to
a family in easy circumstances I can be happy at my ease I love
Aquilina too well to allow her to belong to that old toad I myself am
going to marry Mme de la Garde cried the sergeant

Old toad Castanier murmured piteously

Here come the master and mistress hide yourself Stay get in here
Monsieur Leon said Jenny The master wont stay here for very long

Castanier watched the sergeant hide himself among Aquilinas gowns
in her dressingroom Almost immediately he himself appeared upon the
scene and took leave of his mistress who made fun of him in asides
to Jenny while she uttered the sweetest and tenderest words in his
ears She wept with one side of her face and laughed with the other
The audience called for an encore

Accursed creature cried Castanier from his box

Aquilina was laughing till the tears came into her eyes

Goodness she cried how funny Perlet is as the Englishwoman Why
dont you laugh Every one else in the house is laughing Laugh dear
she said to Castanier

Melmoth burst out laughing and the unhappy cashier shuddered The
Englishmans laughter wrung his heart and tortured his brain it was as
if a surgeon had bored his skull with a redhot iron

Laughing are they laughing stammered Castanier

He did not see the prim English lady whom Perlet was acting with such
ludicrous effect nor hear the EnglishFrench that had filled the house
with roars of laughter instead of all this he beheld himself hurrying
from the Rue Richer hailing a cab on the Boulevard bargaining with
the man to take him to Versailles Then once more the scene changed He
recognized the sorry inn at the corner of the Rue de lOrangerie and the
Rue des Recollets which was kept by his old quartermaster It was two
oclock in the morning the most perfect stillness prevailed no one was
there to watch his movements The posthorses were put into the carriage
it came from a house in the Avenue de Paris in which an Englishman
lived and had been ordered in the foreigners name to avoid raising
suspicion Castanier saw that he had his bills and his passports
stepped into the carriage and set out But at the barrier he saw two
gendarmes lying in wait for the carriage A cry of horror burst from him
but Melmoth gave him a glance and again the sound died in his throat

Keep your eyes on the stage and be quiet said the Englishman

In another moment Castanier saw himself flung into prison at the
Conciergerie and in the fifth act of the drama entitled _The Cashier_
he saw himself in three months time condemned to twenty years of
penal servitude Again a cry broke from him He was exposed upon the
Place du PalaisdeJustice and the executioner branded him with a
redhot iron Then came the last scene of all among some sixty convicts
in the prison yard of the Bicetre he was awaiting his turn to have the
irons riveted on his limbs

Dear me I cannot laugh any more said Aquilina You are very
solemn dear boy what can be the matter The gentleman has gone

A word with you Castanier said Melmoth when the piece was at an end
and the attendant was fastening Mme de la Gardes cloak

The corridor was crowded and escape impossible

Very well what is it

No human power can hinder you from taking Aquilina home and going next
to Versailles there to be arrested

How so

Because you are in a hand that will never relax its grasp returned
the Englishman

Castanier longed for the power to utter some word that should blot him
out from among living men and hide him in the lowest depths of hell

Suppose that the Devil were to make a bid for your soul would you not
give it to him now in exchange for the power of God One single word
and those five hundred thousand francs shall be back in the Baron de
Nucingens safe then you can tear up the letter of credit and all
traces of your crime will be obliterated Moreover you would have gold
in torrents You hardly believe in anything perhaps Well if all this
comes to pass you will believe at least in the Devil

If it were only possible said Castanier joyfully

The man who can do it all gives you his word that it is possible
answered the Englishman

Melmoth Castanier and Mme de la Garde were standing out in the
Boulevard when Melmoth raised his arm A drizzling rain was falling
the streets were muddy the air was close there was thick darkness
overhead but in a moment as the arm was outstretched Paris was filled
with sunlight it was high noon on a bright July day The trees were
covered with leaves a double stream of joyous holiday makers strolled
beneath them Sellers of liquorice water shouted their cool drinks
Splendid carriages rolled past along the streets A cry of terror broke
from the cashier and at that cry rain and darkness once more settled
down upon the Boulevard

Mme de la Garde had stepped into the carriage Do be quick dear
she cried either come in or stay out Really you are as dull as
ditchwater this evening

What must I do Castanier asked of Melmoth

Would you like to take my place inquired the Englishman

Yes

Very well then I will be at your house in a few moments

By the by Castanier you are rather off your balance Aquilina
remarked There is some mischief brewing you were quite melancholy and
thoughtful all through the play Do you want anything that I can give
you dear Tell me

I am waiting till we are at home to know whether you love me

You need not wait till then she said throwing her arms round his
neck There she said as she embraced him passionately to all
appearance and plied him with the coaxing caresses that are part of the
business of such a life as hers like stage action for an actress

Where is the music asked Castanier

What next Only think of your hearing music now

Heavenly music he went on The sounds seem to come from above

What You have always refused to give me a box at the Italiens because
you could not abide music and are you turning musicmad at this time
of day Madthat you are The music is inside your own noddle old
addlepate she went on as she took his head in her hands and rocked
it to and fro on her shoulder Tell me now old man isnt it the
creaking of the wheels that sings in your ears

Just listen Naqui If the angels make music for God Almighty it must
be such music as this that I am drinking in at every pore rather
than hearing I do no know how to tell you about it it is as sweet as
honeywater

Why of course they have music in heaven for the angels in all the
pictures have harps in their hands He is mad upon my word she
said to herself as she saw Castaniers attitude he looked like an
opiumeater in a blissful trance

They reached the house Castanier absorbed by the thought of all that
he had just heard and seen knew not whether to believe it or not he
was like a drunken man and utterly unable to think connectedly He
came to himself in Aquilinas room whither he had been supported by
the united efforts of his mistress the porter and Jenny for he had
fainted as he stepped from the carriage

_He_ will be here directly Oh my friends my friends he cried and
he flung himself despairingly into the depths of a low chair beside the
fire

Jenny heard the bell as he spoke and admitted the Englishman She
announced that a gentleman had come who had made an appointment with
the master when Melmoth suddenly appeared and deep silence followed
He looked at the porterthe porter went he looked at Jennyand Jenny
went likewise

Madame said Melmoth turning to Aquilina with your permission we
will conclude a piece of urgent business

He took Castaniers hand and Castanier rose and the two men went into
the drawingroom There was no light in the room but Melmoths eyes
lit up the thickest darkness The gaze of those strange eyes had left
Aquilina like one spellbound she was helpless unable to take any
thought for her lover moreover she believed him to be safe in
Jennys room whereas their early return had taken the waitingwoman by
surprise and she had hidden the officer in the dressingroom It had
all happened exactly as in the drama that Melmoth had displayed for his
victim Presently the housedoor was slammed violently and Castanier
reappeared

What ails you cried the horrorstruck Aquilina

There was a change in the cashiers appearance A strange pallor
overspread his once rubicund countenance it wore the peculiarly
sinister and stony look of the mysterious visitor The sullen glare of
his eyes was intolerable the fierce light in them seemed to scorch The
man who had looked so goodhumored and goodnatured had suddenly grown
tyrannical and proud The courtesan thought that Castanier had grown
thinner there was a terrible majesty in his brow it was as if a dragon
breathed forth a malignant influence that weighed upon the others like a
close heavy atmosphere For a moment Aquilina knew not what to do

What has passed between you and that diabolicallooking man in those
few minutes she asked at length

I have sold my soul to him I feel it I am no longer the same He has
taken my _self_ and given me his soul in exchange

What

You would not understand it at all Ah he was right Castanier
went on the fiend was right I see everything and know all
thingsYou have been deceiving me

Aquilina turned cold with terror Castanier lighted a candle and
went into the dressingroom The unhappy girl followed him with dazed
bewilderment and great was her astonishment when Castanier drew the
dresses that hung there aside and disclosed the sergeant

Come out my boy said the cashier and taking Leon by a button of
his overcoat he drew the officer into his room

The Piedmontese haggard and desperate had flung herself into her
easychair Castanier seated himself on a sofa by the fire and left
Aquilinas lover in a standing position

You have been in the army said Leon I am ready to give you
satisfaction

You are a fool said Castanier drily I have no occasion to fight
I could kill you by a look if I had any mind to do it I will tell you
what it is youngster why should I kill you I can see a red line round
your neckthe guillotine is waiting for you Yes you will end in the
Place de Greve You are the headsmans property there is no escape for
you You belong to a vendita of the Carbonari You are plotting against
the Government

You did not tell me that cried the Piedmontese turning to Leon

So you do not know that the Minister decided this morning to put down
your Society the cashier continued The ProcureurGeneral has a list
of your names You have been betrayed They are busy drawing up the
indictment at this moment

Then was it you who betrayed him cried Aquilina and with a hoarse
sound in her throat like the growl of a tigress she rose to her feet
she seemed as if she would tear Castanier in pieces

You know me too well to believe it Castanier retorted Aquilina was
benumbed by his coolness

Then how do you know it she murmured

I did not know it until I went into the drawingroom now I know
itnow I see and know all things and can do all things

The sergeant was overcome with amazement

Very well then save him save him dear cried the girl flinging
herself at Castaniers feet If nothing is impossible to you save him
I will love you I will adore you I will be your slave and not your
mistress I will obey your wildest whims you shall do as you will
with me Yes yes I will give you more than love you shall have a
daughters devotion as well as Rodolphe why will you not understand
After all however violent my passions may be I shall be yours for
ever What should I say to persuade you I will invent pleasures I
Great heavens one moment whatever you shall ask of meto fling myself
from the window for instanceyou will need to say but one word Leon
and I will plunge down into hell I would bear any torture any pain of
body or soul anything you might inflict upon me

Castanier heard her with indifference For an answer he indicated Leon
to her with a fiendish laugh

The guillotine is waiting for him he repeated

No no no He shall not leave this house I will save him she cried
Yes I will kill any one who lays a finger upon him Why will you not
save him she shrieked aloud her eyes were blazing her hair unbound
Can you save him

I can do everything

Why do you not save him

Why shouted Castanier and his voice made the ceiling ringEh it
is my revenge Doing evil is my trade

Die said Aquilina must he die my lover Is it possible

She sprang up and snatched a stiletto from a basket that stood on the
chest of drawers and went to Castanier who now began to laugh

You know very well that steel cannot hurt me now

Aquilinas arm suddenly dropped like a snapped harp string

Out with you my good friend said the cashier turning to the
sergeant and go about your business

He held out his hand the other felt Castaniers superior power and
could not choose but to obey

This house is mine I could send for the commissary of police if I
chose and give you up as a man who has hidden himself on my premises
but I would rather let you go I am a fiend I am not a spy

I shall follow him said Aquilina

Then follow him returned CastanierHere Jenny

Jenny appeared

Tell the porter to hail a cab for themHere Naqui said Castanier
drawing a bundle of banknotes from his pocket you shall not go away
like a pauper from a man who loves you still

He held out three hundred thousand francs Aquilina took the notes
flung them on the floor spat on them and trampled upon them in a
frenzy of despair

We will leave this house on foot she cried without a farthing of
your moneyJenny stay where you are

Goodevening answered the cashier as he gathered up the notes again
I have come back from my journeyJenny he added looking at the
bewildered waitingmaid you seem to me to be a good sort of girl You
have no mistress now Come here This evening you shall have a master

Aquilina who felt safe nowhere went at once with the sergeant to the
house of one of her friends But all Leons movements were suspiciously
watched by the police and after a time he and three of his friends were
arrested The whole story may be found in the newspapers of that day



Castanier felt that he had undergone a mental as well as a physical
transformation The Castanier of old no longer existedthe boy the
young Lothario the soldier who had proved his courage who had been
tricked into a marriage and disillusioned the cashier the passionate
lover who had committed a crime for Aquilinas sake His inmost nature
had suddenly asserted itself His brain had expanded his senses had
developed His thoughts comprehended the whole world he saw all the
things of earth as if he had been raised to some high pinnacle above the
world

Until that evening at the play he had loved Aquilina to distraction
Rather than give her up he would have shut his eyes to her infidelities
and now all that blind passion had passed away as a cloud vanishes in
the sunlight

Jenny was delighted to succeed to her mistress position and fortune
and did the cashiers will in all things but Castanier who could read
the inmost thoughts of the soul discovered the real motive underlying
this purely physical devotion He amused himself with her however
like a mischievous child who greedily sucks the juice of the cherry and
flings away the stone The next morning at breakfast time when she
was fully convinced that she was a lady and the mistress of the house
Castanier uttered one by one the thoughts that filled her mind as she
drank her coffee

Do you know what you are thinking child he said smiling I will
tell you So all that lovely rosewood furniture that I coveted so much
and the pretty dresses that I used to try on are mine now All on easy
terms that Madame refused I do no know why My word if I might
drive about in a carriage have jewels and pretty things a box at the
theatre and put something by with me he should lead a life of pleasure
fit to kill him if he were not as strong as a Turk I never saw such
a manWas not that just what you were thinking he went on and
something in his voice made Jenny turn pale Well yes child you
could not stand it and I am sending you away for your own good you
would perish in the attempt Come let us part good friends and he
coolly dismissed her with a very small sum of money

The first use that Castanier had promised himself that he would make of
the terrible power brought at the price of his eternal happiness was
the full and complete indulgence of all his tastes

He first put his affairs in order readily settled his accounts with
M de Nucingen who found a worthy German to succeed him and then
determined on a carouse worthy of the palmiest days of the Roman Empire
He plunged into dissipation as recklessly as Belshazzar of old went to
that last feast in Babylon Like Belshazzar he saw clearly through his
revels a gleaming hand that traced his doom in letters of flame not on
the narrow walls of the banquetingchamber but over the vast spaces
of heaven that the rainbow spans His feast was not indeed an orgy
confined within the limits of a banquet for he squandered all the
powers of soul and body in exhausting all the pleasures of earth The
table was in some sort earth itself the earth that trembled beneath
his feet His was the last festival of the reckless spendthrift who has
thrown all prudence to the winds The devil had given him the key of the
storehouse of human pleasures he had filled and refilled his hands and
he was fast nearing the bottom In a moment he had felt all that that
enormous power could accomplish in a moment he had exercised it proved
it wearied of it What had hitherto been the sum of human desires
became as nothing So often it happens that with possession the vast
poetry of desire must end and the thing possessed is seldom the thing
that we dreamed of

Beneath Melmoths omnipotence lurked this tragical anticlimax of so
many a passion and now the inanity of human nature was revealed to his
successor to whom infinite power brought Nothingness as a dowry

To come to a clear understanding of Castaniers strange position it
must be borne in mind how suddenly these revolutions of thought and
feeling had been wrought how quickly they had succeeded each other
and of these things it is hard to give any idea to those who have never
broken the prison bonds of time and space and distance His relation
to the world without had been entirely changed with the expansion of his
faculties

Like Melmoth himself Castanier could travel in a few moments over the
fertile plains of India could soar on the wings of demons above African
desert spaces or skim the surface of the seas The same insight that
could read the inmost thoughts of others could apprehend at a glance
the nature of any material object just as he caught as it were all
flavors at once upon his tongue He took his pleasure like a despot
a blow of the axe felled the tree that he might eat its fruits The
transitions the alternations that measure joy and pain and diversify
human happiness no longer existed for him He had so completely glutted
his appetites that pleasure must overpass the limits of pleasure to
tickle a palate cloyed with satiety and suddenly grown fastidious
beyond all measure so that ordinary pleasures became distasteful
Conscious that at will he was the master of all the women that he could
desire knowing that his power was irresistible he did not care to
exercise it they were pliant to his unexpressed wishes to his most
extravagant caprices until he felt a horrible thirst for love and
would have love beyond their power to give

The world refused him nothing save faith and prayer the soothing
and consoling love that is not of this world He was obeyedit was a
horrible position

The torrents of pain and pleasure and thought that shook his soul and
his bodily frame would have overwhelmed the strongest human being but
in him there was a power of vitality proportioned to the power of the
sensations that assailed him He felt within him a vague immensity of
longing that earth could not satisfy He spent his days on outspread
wings longing to traverse the luminous fields of space to other
spheres that he knew afar by intuitive perception a clear and hopeless
knowledge His soul dried up within him for he hungered and thirsted
after things that can neither be drunk nor eaten but for which he could
not choose but crave His lips like Melmoths burned with desire he
panted for the unknown for he knew all things

The mechanism and the scheme of the world was apparent to him and its
working interested him no longer he did not long disguise the profound
scorn that makes of a man of extraordinary powers a sphinx who knows
everything and says nothing and sees all things with an unmoved
countenance He felt not the slightest wish to communicate his knowledge
to other men He was rich with all the wealth of the world with one
effort he could make the circle of the globe and riches and power were
meaningless for him He felt the awful melancholy of omnipotence a
melancholy which Satan and God relieve by the exercise of infinite power
in mysterious ways known to them alone Castanier had not like his
Master the inextinguishable energy of hate and malice he felt that he
was a devil but a devil whose time was not yet come while Satan is a
devil through all eternity and being damned beyond redemption delights
to stir up the world like a dung heap with his triple fork and to
thwart therein the designs of God But Castanier for his misfortune
had one hope left

If in a moment he could move from one pole to the other as a bird
springs restlessly from side to side in its cage when like the bird
he has crossed his prison he saw the vast immensity of space beyond it
That vision of the Infinite left him for ever unable to see humanity and
its affairs as other men saw them The insensate fools who long for the
power of the Devil gauge its desirability from a human standpoint they
do not see that with the Devils power they will likewise assume his
thoughts and that they will be doomed to remain as men among creatures
who will no longer understand them The Nero unknown to history who
dreams of setting Paris on fire for his private entertainment like
an exhibition of a burning house on the boards of a theatre does not
suspect that if he had the power Paris would become for him as little
interesting as an antheap by the roadside to a hurrying passerby The
circle of the sciences was for Castanier something like a logogriph
for a man who does not know the key to it Kings and Governments were
despicable in his eyes His great debauch had been in some sort a
deplorable farewell to his life as a man The earth had grown too
narrow for him for the infernal gifts laid bare for him the secrets of
creationhe saw the cause and foresaw its end He was shut out from
all that men call heaven in all languages under the sun he could no
longer think of heaven

Then he came to understand the look on his predecessors face and the
drying up of the life within then he knew all that was meant by the
baffled hope that gleamed in Melmoths eyes he too knew the thirst
that burned those red lips and the agony of a continual struggle
between two natures grown to giant size Even yet he might be an angel
and he knew himself to be a fiend His was the fate of a sweet and
gentle creature that a wizards malice has imprisoned in a misshapen
form entrapping it by a pact so that anothers will must set it free
from its detested envelope

As a deception only increases the ardor with which a man of really
great nature explores the infinite of sentiment in a womans heart so
Castanier awoke to find that one idea lay like a weight upon his soul
an idea which was perhaps the key to loftier spheres The very fact that
he had bartered away his eternal happiness led him to dwell in thought
upon the future of those who pray and believe On the morrow of his
debauch when he entered into the sober possession of his power this
idea made him feel himself a prisoner he knew the burden of the woe
that poets and prophets and great oracles of faith have set forth for
us in such mighty words he felt the point of the Flaming Sword plunged
into his side and hurried in search of Melmoth What had become of his
predecessor

The Englishman was living in a mansion in the Rue Ferou near
SaintSulpicea gloomy dark damp and cold abode The Rue Ferou
itself is one of the most dismal streets in Paris it has a north aspect
like all the streets that lie at right angles to the left bank of the
Seine and the houses are in keeping with the site As Castanier stood
on the threshold he found that the door itself like the vaulted roof
was hung with black rows of lighted tapers shone brilliantly as though
some king were lying in state and a priest stood on either side of a
catafalque that had been raised there

There is no need to ask why you have come sir the old hall porter
said to Castanier you are so like our poor dear master that is gone
But if you are his brother you have come too late to bid him goodbye
The good gentleman died the night before last

How did he die Castanier asked of one of the priests

Set your mind at rest said the old priest he partly raised as he
spoke the black pall that covered the catafalque

Castanier looking at him saw one of those faces that faith has made
sublime the soul seemed to shine forth from every line of it bringing
light and warmth for other men kindled by the unfailing charity within
This was Sir John Melmoths confessor

Your brother made an end that men may envy and that must rejoice
the angels Do you know what joy there is in heaven over a sinner
that repents His tears of penitence excited by grace flowed without
ceasing death alone checked them The Holy Spirit dwelt in him His
burning words full of lively faith were worthy of the ProphetKing
If in the course of my life I have never heard a more dreadful
confession than from the lips of this Irish gentleman I have likewise
never heard such fervent and passionate prayers However great the
measures of his sins may have been his repentance has filled the abyss
to overflowing The hand of God was visibly stretched out above him for
he was completely changed there was such heavenly beauty in his face
The hard eyes were softened by tears the resonant voice that struck
terror into those who heard it took the tender and compassionate tones
of those who themselves have passed through deep humiliation He so
edified those who heard his words that some who had felt drawn to see
the spectacle of a Christians death fell on their knees as he spoke of
heavenly things and of the infinite glory of God and gave thanks and
praise to Him If he is leaving no worldly wealth to his family no
family can possess a greater blessing than this that he surely gained
for them a soul among the blessed who will watch over you all and
direct you in the path to heaven

These words made such a vivid impression upon Castanier that he
instantly hurried from the house to the Church of SaintSulpice
obeying what might be called a decree of fate Melmoths repentance had
stupefied him


At that time on certain mornings in the week a preacher famed for
his eloquence was wont to hold conferences in the course of which
he demonstrated the truths of the Catholic faith for the youth of a
generation proclaimed to be indifferent in matters of belief by another
voice no less eloquent than his own The conference had been put off to
a later hour on account of Melmoths funeral so Castanier arrived just
as the great preacher was epitomizing the proofs of a future existence
of happiness with all the charm of eloquence and force of expression
which have made him famous The seeds of divine doctrine fell into
a soil prepared for them in the old dragoon into whom the Devil had
glided Indeed if there is a phenomenon well attested by experience
is it not the spiritual phenomenon commonly called the faith of the
peasant The strength of belief varies inversely with the amount of
use that a man has made of his reasoning faculties Simple people and
soldiers belong to the unreasoning class Those who have marched through
life beneath the banner of instinct are far more ready to receive the
light than minds and hearts overwearied with the worlds sophistries

Castanier had the southern temperament he had joined the army as a lad
of sixteen and had followed the French flag till he was nearly forty
years old As a common trooper he had fought day and night and day
after day and as in duty bound had thought of his horse first and
of himself afterwards While he served his military apprenticeship
therefore he had but little leisure in which to reflect on the destiny
of man and when he became an officer he had his men to think of He had
been swept from battlefield to battlefield but he had never thought of
what comes after death A soldiers life does not demand much thinking
Those who cannot understand the lofty political ends involved and the
interests of nation and nation who cannot grasp political schemes as
well as plans of campaign and combine the science of the tactician with
that of the administrator are bound to live in a state of ignorance
the most boorish peasant in the most backward district in France is
scarcely in a worse case Such men as these bear the brunt of war yield
passive obedience to the brain that directs them and strike down
the men opposed to them as the woodcutter fells timber in the forest
Violent physical exertion is succeeded by times of inertia when they
repair the waste They fight and drink fight and eat fight and sleep
that they may the better deal hard blows the powers of the mind are
not greatly exercised in this turbulent round of existence and the
character is as simple as heretofore

When the men who have shown such energy on the battlefield return to
ordinary civilization most of those who have not risen to high rank
seem to have acquired no ideas and to have no aptitude no capacity
for grasping new ideas To the utter amazement of a younger generation
those who made our armies so glorious and so terrible are as simple as
children and as slowwitted as a clerk at his worst and the captain of
a thundering squadron is scarcely fit to keep a merchants daybook Old
soldiers of this stamp therefore being innocent of any attempt to
use their reasoning faculties act upon their strongest impulses
Castaniers crime was one of those matters that raise so many questions
that in order to debate about it a moralist might call for its
discussion by clauses to make use of a parliamentary expression

Passion had counseled the crime the cruelly irresistible power of
feminine witchery had driven him to commit it no man can say of
himself I will never do that when a siren joins in the combat and
throws her spells over him

So the word of life fell upon a conscience newly awakened to the truths
of religion which the French Revolution and a soldiers career had
forced Castanier to neglect The solemn words You will be happy or
miserable for all eternity made but the more terrible impression upon
him because he had exhausted earth and shaken it like a barren tree
because his desires could effect all things so that it was enough that
any spot in earth or heaven should be forbidden him and he forthwith
thought of nothing else If it were allowable to compare such great
things with social follies Castaniers position was not unlike that of
a banker who finding that his allpowerful millions cannot obtain for
him an entrance into the society of the noblesse must set his heart
upon entering that circle and all the social privileges that he has
already acquired are as nothing in his eyes from the moment when he
discovers that a single one is lacking

Here is a man more powerful than all the kings on earth put together a
man who like Satan could wrestle with God Himself leaning against
one of the pillars in the Church of SaintSulpice weighed down by the
feelings and thoughts that oppressed him and absorbed in the thought of
a Future the same thought that had engulfed Melmoth

He was very happy was Melmoth cried Castanier He died in the
certain knowledge that he would go to heaven

In a moment the greatest possible change had been wrought in the
cashiers ideas For several days he had been a devil now he was
nothing but a man an image of the fallen Adam of the sacred tradition
embodied in all cosmogonies But while he had thus shrunk he retained
a germ of greatness he had been steeped in the Infinite The power of
hell had revealed the divine power He thirsted for heaven as he had
never thirsted after the pleasures of earth that are so soon exhausted
The enjoyments which the fiend promises are but the enjoyments of earth
on a larger scale but to the joys of heaven there is no limit He
believed in God and the spell that gave him the treasures of the world
was as nothing to him now the treasures themselves seemed to him as
contemptible as pebbles to an admirer of diamonds they were but gewgaws
compared with the eternal glories of the other life A curse lay he
thought on all things that came to him from this source He sounded
dark depths of painful thought as he listened to the service performed
for Melmoth The _Dies irae_ filled him with awe he felt all the
grandeur of that cry of a repentant soul trembling before the Throne of
God The Holy Spirit like a devouring flame passed through him as fire
consumes straw

The tears were falling from his eyes whenAre you a relation of the
dead the beadle asked him

I am his heir Castanier answered

Give something for the expenses of the services cried the man

No said the cashier The Devils money should not go to the Church

For the poor

No

For repairing the Church

No

The Lady Chapel

No

For the schools

No

Castanier went not caring to expose himself to the sour looks that the
irritated functionaries gave him

Outside in the street he looked up at the Church of SaintSulpice
What made people build the giant cathedrals I have seen in every
country he asked himself The feeling shared so widely throughout all
time must surely be based upon something

Something Do you call God _something_ cried his conscience God
God God

The word was echoed and reechoed by an inner voice til it overwhelmed
him but his feeling of terror subsided as he heard sweet distant sounds
of music that he had caught faintly before They were singing in the
church he thought and his eyes scanned the great doorway But as he
listened more closely the sounds poured upon him from all sides he
looked round the square but there was no sign of any musicians The
melody brought visions of a distant heaven and faroff gleams of hope
but it also quickened the remorse that had set the lost soul in a
ferment He went on his way through Paris walking as men walk who
are crushed beneath the burden of their sorrow seeing everything
with unseeing eyes loitering like an idler stopping without cause
muttering to himself careless of the traffic making no effort to avoid
a blow from a plank of timber

Imperceptibly repentance brought him under the influence of the divine
grace that soothes while it bruises the heart so terribly His face came
to wear a look of Melmoth something great with a trace of madness in
the greatnessa look of dull and hopeless distress mingled with the
excited eagerness of hope and beneath it all a gnawing sense of
loathing for all that the world can give The humblest of prayers lurked
in the eyes that saw with such dreadful clearness His power was the
measure of his anguish His body was bowed down by the fearful storm
that shook his soul as the tall pines bend before the blast Like his
predecessor he could not refuse to bear the burden of life he
was afraid to die while he bore the yoke of hell The torment grew
intolerable

At last one morning he bethought himself how that Melmoth now among
the blessed had made the proposal of an exchange and how that he had
accepted it others doubtless would follow his example for in an age
proclaimed by the inheritors of the eloquence of the Fathers of the
Church to be fatally indifferent to religion it should be easy to find
a man who would accept the conditions of the contract in order to prove
its advantages

There is one place where you can learn what kings will fetch in the
market where nations are weighed in the balance and systems appraised
where the value of a government is stated in terms of the fivefranc
piece where ideas and beliefs have their price and everything is
discounted where God Himself in a manner borrows on the security of
His revenue of souls for the Pope has a running account there Is it
not there that I should go to traffic in souls

Castanier went quite joyously on Change thinking that it would be as
easy to buy a soul as to invest money in the Funds Any ordinary person
would have feared ridicule but Castanier knew by experience that
a desperate man takes everything seriously A prisoner lying under
sentence of death would listen to the madman who should tell him that
by pronouncing some gibberish he could escape through the keyhole for
suffering is credulous and clings to an idea until it fails as the
swimmer borne along by the current clings to the branch that snaps in
his hand

Towards four oclock that afternoon Castanier appeared among the little
knots of men who were transacting private business after Change He was
personally known to some of the brokers and while affecting to be in
search of an acquaintance he managed to pick up the current gossip and
rumors of failure

Catch me negotiating bills for Claparon  Co my boy The bank
collector went round to return their acceptances to them this morning
said a fat banker in his outspoken way If you have any of their paper
look out

Claparon was in the building in deep consultation with a man well known
for the ruinous rate at which he lent money Castanier went forthwith in
search of the said Claparon a merchant who had a reputation for taking
heavy risks that meant wealth or utter ruin The moneylender walked
away as Castanier came up A gesture betrayed the speculators despair

Well Claparon the Bank wants a hundred thousand francs of you and it
is four oclock the thing is known and it is too late to arrange your
little failure comfortably said Castanier

Sir

Speak lower the cashier went on How if I were to propose a piece of
business that would bring you in as much money as you require

It would not discharge my liabilities every business that I ever heard
of wants a little time to simmer in

I know of something that will set you straight in a moment answered
Castanier but first you would have to

Do what

Sell your share of paradise It is a matter of business like anything
else isnt it We all hold shares in the great Speculation of
Eternity

I tell you this said Claparon angrily that I am just the man to
lend you a slap in the face When a man is in trouble it is no time to
pay silly jokes on him

I am talking seriously said Castanier and he drew a bundle of notes
from his pocket

In the first place said Claparon I am not going to sell my soul
to the Devil for a trifle I want five hundred thousand francs before I
strike

Who talks of stinting you asked Castanier cutting him short You
shall have more gold than you could stow in the cellars of the Bank of
France

He held out a handful of notes That decided Claparon

Done he cried but how is the bargain to be make

Let us go over yonder no one is standing there said Castanier
pointing to a corner of the court

Claparon and his tempter exchanged a few words with their faces turned
to the wall None of the onlookers guessed the nature of this byplay
though their curiosity was keenly excited by the strange gestures of
the two contracting parties When Castanier returned there was a sudden
outburst of amazed exclamation As in the Assembly where the least event
immediately attracts attention all faces were turned to the two men who
had caused the sensation and a shiver passed through all beholders at
the change that had taken place in them

The men who form the moving crowd that fills the Stock Exchange are soon
known to each other by sight They watch each other like players round
a cardtable Some shrewd observers can tell how a man will play and
the condition of his exchequer from a survey of his face and the Stock
Exchange is simply a vast cardtable Every one therefore had noticed
Claparon and Castanier The latter like the Irishman before him had
been muscular and powerful his eyes were full of light his color high
The dignity and power in his face had struck awe into them all they
wondered how old Castanier had come by it and now they beheld Castanier
divested of his power shrunken wrinkled aged and feeble He had
drawn Claparon out of the crowd with the energy of a sick man in a
fever fit he had looked like an opiumeater during the brief period of
excitement that the drug can give now on his return he seemed to be
in the condition of utter exhaustion in which the patient dies after
the fever departs or to be suffering from the horrible prostration
that follows on excessive indulgence in the delights of narcotics The
infernal power that had upheld him through his debauches had left him
and the body was left unaided and alone to endure the agony of remorse
and the heavy burden of sincere repentance Claparons troubles every
one could guess but Claparon reappeared on the other hand with
sparkling eyes holding his head high with the pride of Lucifer The
crisis had passed from the one man to the other

Now you can drop off with an easy mind old man said Claparon to
Castanier

For pitys sake send for a cab and for a priest send for the curate
of SaintSulpice answered the old dragoon sinking down upon the
curbstone

The words a priest reached the ears of several people and produced
uproarious jeering among the stockbrokers for faith with these
gentlemen means a belief that a scrap of paper called a mortgage
represents an estate and the List of Fundholders is their Bible

Shall I have time to repent said Castanier to himself in a piteous
voice that impressed Claparon

A cab carried away the dying man the speculator went to the bank at
once to meet his bills and the momentary sensation produced upon the
throng of business men by the sudden change on the two faces vanished
like the furrow cut by a ships keel in the sea News of the greatest
importance kept the attention of the world of commerce on the alert and
when commercial interests are at stake Moses might appear with his two
luminous horns and his coming would scarcely receive the honors of
a pun the gentlemen whose business it is to write the Market Reports
would ignore his existence

When Claparon had made his payments fear seized upon him There was
no mistake about his power He went on Change again and offered his
bargain to other men in embarrassed circumstances The Devils bond
together with the rights easements and privileges appertaining
thereuntoto use the expression of the notary who succeeded Claparon
changed hands for the sum of seven hundred thousand francs The notary
in his turn parted with the agreement with the Devil for five hundred
thousand francs to a building contractor in difficulties who likewise
was rid of it to an iron merchant in consideration of a hundred thousand
crowns In fact by five oclock people had ceased to believe in the
strange contract and purchasers were lacking for want of confidence

At halfpast five the holder of the bond was a housepainter who was
lounging by the door of the building in the Rue Feydeau where at that
time stockbrokers temporarily congregated The housepainter simple
fellow could not think what was the matter with him He felt all
anyhow so he told his wife when he went home

The Rue Feydeau as idlers about town are aware is a place of
pilgrimage for youths who for lack of a mistress bestow their ardent
affection upon the whole sex On the first floor of the most rigidly
respectable domicile therein dwelt one of those exquisite creatures
whom it has pleased heaven to endow with the rarest and most surpassing
beauty As it is impossible that they should all be duchesses or queens
since there are many more pretty women in the world than titles and
thrones for them to adorn they are content to make a stockbroker or a
banker happy at a fixed price To this goodnatured beauty Euphrasia
by name an unbounded ambition had led a notarys clerk to aspire In
short the second clerk in the office of Maitre Crottat notary had
fallen in love with her as youth at twoandtwenty can fall in love
The scrivener would have murdered the Pope and run amuck through the
whole sacred college to procure the miserable sum of a hundred louis to
pay for a shawl which had turned Euphrasias head at which price her
waitingwoman had promised that Euphrasia should be his The infatuated
youth walked to and fro under Madame Euphrasias windows like the
polar bears in their cage at the Jardin des Plantes with his right hand
thrust beneath his waistcoat in the region of the heart which he was
fit to tear from his bosom but as yet he had only wrenched at the
elastic of his braces

What can one do to raise ten thousand francs he asked himself Shall
I make off with the money that I must pay on the registration of that
conveyance Good heavens my loan would not ruin the purchaser a man
with seven millions And then next day I would fling myself at his feet
and say I have taken ten thousand francs belonging to you sir I am
twentytwo years of age and I am in love with Euphrasiathat is my
story My father is rich he will pay you back do not ruin me Have
not you yourself been twentytwo years old and madly in love But these
beggarly landowners have no souls He would be quite likely to give me
up to the public prosecutor instead of taking pity upon me Good God
if it were only possible to sell your soul to the Devil But there is
neither a God nor a Devil it is all nonsense out of nursery tales and
old wives talk What shall I do

If you have a mind to sell your soul to the Devil sir said the
housepainter who had overheard something that the clerk let fall you
can have the ten thousand francs

And Euphrasia cried the clerk as he struck a bargain with the devil
that inhabited the housepainter

The pact concluded the frantic clerk went to find the shawl and
mounted Madame Euphrasias staircase and as literally the devil was
in him he did not come down for twelve days drowning the thought
of hell and of his privileges in twelve days of love and riot and
forgetfulness for which he had bartered away all his hopes of a
paradise to come

And in this way the secret of the vast power discovered and acquired by
the Irishman the offspring of Maturins brain was lost to mankind
and the various Orientalists Mystics and Archaeologists who take an
interest in these matters were unable to hand down to posterity the
proper method of invoking the Devil for the following sufficient
reasons

On the thirteenth day after these frenzied nuptials the wretched
clerk lay on a pallet bed in a garret in his masters house in the Rue
SaintHonore Shame the stupid goddess who dares not behold herself
had taken possession of the young man He had fallen ill he would nurse
himself misjudged the quantity of a remedy devised by the skill of
a practitioner well known on the walls of Paris and succumbed to the
effects of an overdose of mercury His corpse was as black as a moles
back A devil had left unmistakable traces of its passage there could
it have been Ashtaroth



The estimable youth to whom you refer has been carried away to the
planet Mercury said the head clerk to a German demonologist who came
to investigate the matter at first hand

I am quite prepared to believe it answered the Teuton

Oh

Yes sir returned the other The opinion you advance coincides with
the very words of Jacob Boehme In the fortyeighth proposition of _The
Threefold Life of Man_ he says that if God hath brought all things
to pass with a LET THERE BE the FIAT is the secret matrix which
comprehends and apprehends the nature which is formed by the spirit born
of Mercury and of God

What do you say sir

The German delivered his quotation afresh

We do not know it said the clerks

_Fiat_ said a clerk _Fiat lux_

You can verify the citation for yourselves said the German You will
find the passage in the _Treatise of the Threefold Life of Man_ page
75 the edition was published by M Migneret in 1809 It was translated
into French by a philosopher who had a great admiration for the famous
shoemaker

Oh he was a shoemaker was he said the head clerk

In Prussia said the German

Did he work for the King of Prussia inquired a Boeotian of a second
clerk

He must have vamped up his prose said a third

That man is colossal cried the fourth pointing to the Teuton

That gentleman though a demonologist of the first rank did not know
the amount of devilry to be found in a notarys clerk He went away
without the least idea that they were making game of him and fully
under the impression that the young fellows regarded Boehme as a
colossal genius

Education is making strides in France said he to himself
