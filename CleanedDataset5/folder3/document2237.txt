Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a
copyright notice is included Therefore we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so To be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

Project Gutenbergs Etext of Shakespeares The first Part of
Henry the Sixt




Executive Directors Notes

In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they
are presented herein

 Barnardo Whos there
 Fran Nay answer me Stand  vnfold
your selfe

 Bar Long liue the King



As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc This was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an
assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

So please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors
that are not errors   

So  with this caveat  we have NOT changed the canon errors
here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeares The first
Part of Henry the Sixt

Scanners Notes What this is and isnt This was taken from
a copy of Shakespeares first folio and it is as close as I can
come in ASCII to the printed text

The elongated Ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
Geneva Bible and Shakespeares First Folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within
brackets  is what I have added So if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer Shakespeare

Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio So there may
be differences other than what I have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions This is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run The proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is
The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
First Folio editions best pages

If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best
etext possible My email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom I hope that you enjoy this

into the Register of your owne that I may passe with a
reproofe the easier sith you your selfe know how easie it
is to be such an offender

 Fal Very well Sir proceed

 Ford There is a Gentlewoman in this Towne her
husbands name is Ford

 Fal Well Sir

 Ford I haue long loud her and I protest to you bestowed
much on her followed her with a doating obseruance
Ingrossd opportunities to meete her feed euery
slight occasion that could but nigardly giue mee
sight of her not only bought many presents to giue her
but haue giuen largely to many to know what shee
would haue giuen briefly I haue pursud her as Loue
hath pursued mee which hath beene on the wing of all
occasions but whatsoeuer I haue merited either in my
minde or in my meanes meede I am sure I haue receiued
none vnlesse Experience be a Iewell that I haue purchased
at an infinite rate and that hath taught mee to say
this
Loue like a shadow flies when substance Loue pursues
Pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues

 Fal Haue you receiud no promise of satisfaction at
her hands
 Ford Neuer

 Fal Haue you importund her to such a purpose
 Ford Neuer

 Fal Of what qualitie was your loue then
 Ford Like a fair house built on another mans ground
so that I haue lost my edifice by mistaking the place
where I erected it

 Fal To what purpose haue you vnfolded this to me
 For When I haue told you that I haue told you all
Some say that though she appeare honest to mee yet in
other places shee enlargeth her mirth so farre that there
is shrewd construction made of her Now Sir Iohn here
is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding admirable discourse of great admittance
authenticke in your place and person generally
allowd for your many warlike courtlike and learned
preparations

 Fal O Sir

 Ford Beleeue it for you know it there is money

giue me so much of your time in enchange of it as to lay
an amiable siege to the honesty of this Fords wife vse
your Art of wooing win her to consent to you if any
man may you may as soone as any

 Fal Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection that I should win what you would enioy Methinkes
you prescribe to your selfe very preposterously

 Ford O vnderstand my drift she dwells so securely
on the excellency of her honor that the folly of my soule
dares not present it selfe shee is too bright to be lookd
against Now could I come to her with any detection
in my hand my desires had instance and argument to
commend themselues I could driue her then from the
ward of her purity her reputation her marriagevow
and a thousand other her defences which now are tootoo
strongly embattaild against me what say you toot
Sir Iohn
 Fal Master Broome I will first make bold with your
money next giue mee your hand and last as I am a
gentleman you shall if you will enioy Fords wife

 Ford O good Sir

a search and away went I for foule Cloathes But
marke the sequell Master Broome I suffered the pangs
of three seuerall deaths First an intollerable fright
to be detected with a iealious rotten Bellweather
Next to be compassd like a good Bilbo in the circumference
of a Pecke hilt to point heele to head And
then to be stopt in like a strong distillation with stinking
Cloathes that fretted in their owne grease
thinke of that a man of my Kidney thinke of that
that am as subiect to heate as butter a man of continuall
dissolution and thaw it was a miracle to scape
suffocation And in the height of this Bath when I
was more then halfe stewd in grease like a Dutchdish
to be throwne into the Thames and
coold glowinghot in that serge like a Horseshoo
thinke of that hissing hot thinke of that Master

Nan Page my daughter and my little sonne
And three or foure more of their growth weel dresse
Like Vrchins Ouphes and Fairies greene and white
With rounds of waxen Tapers on their heads
And rattles in their hands vpon a sodaine
As Falstaffe she and I are newly met
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song Vpon their sight
We two in great amazednesse will flye
Then let them all encircle him about
And Fairylike to pinch the vncleane Knight
And aske him why that houre of Fairy Reuell
In their so sacred pathes he dares to tread
In shape prophane

 Ford And till he tell the truth
Let the supposed Fairies pinch him sound
And burne him with their Tapers

 MistPage The truth being knowne
Well all present our selues dishorne the spirit
And mocke him home to Windsor

 Ford The children must
Be practisd well to this or theyll neur doot

Made promise to the Doctor Now thus it rests
Her Father meanes she shall be all in white
And in that habit when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her goe
She shall goe with him her Mother hath intended
The better to deuote her to the Doctor
For they must all be maskd and vizarded
That quaint in greene she shall be loose enroabd
With Ribondspendant flaring bout her head

To pinch her by the hand and on that token
The maid hath giuen consent to go with him

Enter Fairies

 Qui Fairies blacke gray greene and white

You Orphan heires of fixed destiny
Attend your office and your quality
Crier Hobgoblyn make the Fairy Oyes

 Pist Elues list your names Silence you aiery toyes
Cricket to Windsorchimnies shalt thou leape
Where fires thou findst vnrakd and hearths vnswept
There pinch the Maids as blew as Billberry
Our radiant Queene hates Sluts and Sluttery

 Fal They are Fairies he that speaks to them shall die
Ile winke and couch No man their workes must eie

 Eu Whers Bede Go you and where you find a maid
That ere she sleepe has thrice her prayers said
Raise vp the Organs of her fantasie
Sleepe she as sound as carelesse infancie
But those as sleepe and thinke not on their sins
Pinch them armes legs backes shoulders sides  shins

 Qu About about
Search Windsor Castle Elues within and out
Strew good lucke Ouphes on euery sacred roome
That it may stand till the perpetuall doome
In state as wholsome as in state tis fit
Worthy the Owner and the Owner it
The seuerall Chaires of Order looke you scowre
With iuyce of Balme and euery precious flowre
Each faire Instalment Coate and seurall Crest
With loyall Blazon euermore be blest
And NightlymeadowFairies looke you sing
Like to the GartersCompasse in a ring
Th expressure that it beares Greene let it be
More fertilefresh then all the Field to see
And Hony Soit Qui MalyPence write
In Emroldtuffes Flowres purple blew and white
Like Saphirepearle and rich embroiderie
Buckled below faire Knighthoods bending knee
Fairies vse Flowres for their characterie
Away disperse But till tis one a clocke
Our Dance of Custome round about the Oke
Of Herne the Hunter let vs not forget

 Euan Pray you lock hand in hand your selues in order set
And twenty glowwormes shall our Lanthornes bee
To guide our Measure round about the Tree
But stay I smell a man of middle earth

 Fal Oh oh oh

 Qui Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
About him Fairies sing a scornfull rime
And as you trip still pinch him to your time

The Song

Fie on sinnefull phantasie Fie on Lust and Luxurie
Lust is but a bloudy fire kindled with vnchaste desire
Fed in heart whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them higher and higher
Pinch him Fairies mutually Pinch him for his villanie
Pinch him and burne him and turne him about
Till Candles  Starlight  Mooneshine be out

How chance you went not with Mr Slender
 MPage Why went you not with Mr Doctor maid
 Fen You do amaze her heare the truth of it
You would haue married her most shamefully
Where there was no proportion held in loue
The truth is she and I long since contracted
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolue vs
Th offence is holy that she hath committed
And this deceit looses the name of craft
Of disobedience or vnduteous title
Since therein she doth euitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed houres
Which forced marriage would haue brought vpon her

 Ford Stand not amazd here is no remedie
In Loue the heauens themselues do guide the state
Money buyes Lands and wiues are sold by fate

For he to night shall lye with Mistris Ford
