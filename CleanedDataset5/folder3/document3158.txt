OUR AMERICAN COUSIN

A Drama in 3 Acts

By Tom Taylor



Transcribers Note

This etext was produced by the Levin family Englewood CO Like many
plays there is no authoritative version and it evolved over the course
of time indeed in multiple directions The 1869 printing upon which
this etext is primarily based was poorly printed and we have corrected
outright punctuation and grammatical errors while maintaining its
original whimisical use of capitalization and punctuation This version
contains very few Dundrearyisms such as birds of a feather gather no
moss for which the play gained much of its popular appeal

Abraham Lincoln was watching this play when he was assassinated Act
III halfway through Scene 2

his daughter on her marriage with poor Meredith he came here in search
of this stray shoot of the family tree found them and died in their
house leaving Asa one of the sons heir to his personal property in
England which ought to belong to poor Mary Meredith Asa is about to
sail for the old country to take possession I gave him directions
to find you out and he should arrive almost as soon as this letter
Receive him kindly for the sake of the kindness he has shown to me and
let him see some of our shooting Your affectionate brother NED

Mrs M Oh how interesting

Aug Enthusiastically How delightfully romantic I can imagine the
wild young hunter An Apollo of the prairie

Flo An Apollo of the prairie yes with a strong nasal twang and a
decided taste for tobacco and cobblers

Sir E Florence you forget that he is a Trenchard and no true Trenchard
would have a liking for cobblers or low people of that kind

Flo I hate him whatever he is coming here to rob poor cousin Mary of
her grandmothers guineas

Sir E Florence how often must I request you not to speak of Mary
Meredith as your cousin

Two chairs and table brought on at change


Enter Binny and Coyle L 1 E


Binny Sir Hedward will see you directly Mr Coyle

Coyle Very well House full of company I see Mr Binny

Binny Cram full Mr Coyle As one of the first families in the country
we must keep up our position

Coyle Rubbing his hands Certainly certainly that is as long as
we can Mr Binny Tell Murcott my clerk to bring my papers in here
Youll find him in the servants hall and see that you keep your strong
ale out of his way People who serve me must have their senses about
them

Binny Aside I should say so or ed ave hevery tooth hout in their
eds the wiper Exit L 1 E

Coyle And now to show this pompous baronet the precipice on which he
stands


Enter Murcott with green bag and papers


Coyle Are you sober sirrah

Murcott Yes Mr Coyle

Coyle Then see you keep so

Mur Ill do my best sir But oh do tell them to keep liquor out of my
way I cant keep from it now try as I will and I try hard enough God
help me

Coyle Pshaw Get out those mortgages and the letters from my London
agent Murcott takes papers from bag and places then on table Coyle
looks off R 1 E So here comes Sir Edward Go but be within call I
may want you to witness a signature

Mur I will sir Aside I must have brandy or my hand will not be
steady enough to write Exit L 1 E


Enter Sir Edward R 1 E Coyle bows


Sir E Good morning Coyle good morning With affected ease There is
a chair Coyle They sit So you see those infernal tradespeople are
pretty troublesome

Coyle My agents letter this morning announces that Walter and Brass
have got judgement and execution on their amount for repairing your town
house last season Refers to papers Boquet and Barker announce their
intention of taking this same course with the wine account Handmarth
is preparing for a settlement of his heavy demand for the stables
Then there is Temper for pictures and other things and Miss Florence
Trenchards account with Madame Pompon and

Sir E Confound it why harass me with details these infernal
particulars Have you made out the total

Coyle Four thousand eight hundred and thirty pounds nine shillings and
sixpence

Sir E Well of course we must find means of settling this extortion

Coyle Yes Sir Edward if possible

Sir E If possible

Coyle I as your agent must stoop to detail you must allow me to
repeat if possible


Sir E Why you dont say there will be any difficulty in raising the
money

Coyle What means would you suggest Sir Edward

Sir E That sir is your business

Coyle A foretaste in the interest on the Fanhille  Ellenthrope
mortgages you are aware both are in the arrears the mortgagees in
fact write here to announce their intentions to foreclose Shows
papers

Sir E Curse your impudence pay them off

Coyle How Sir Edward

Sir E Confound it sir which of us is the agent Am I to find you
brains for your own business

Coyle No Sir Edward I can furnish the brains but what I ask of you is
to furnish the money

Sir E There must be money somewhere I came into possession of one of
the finest properties in Hampshire only twentysix years ago and now
you mean to tell me I cannot raise 4000 pounds

Coyle The fact is distressing Sir Edward but so it is

Sir E Theres the Ravensdale property unencumbered

Coyle There Sir Edward you are under a mistake The Ravensdale
property is deeply encumbered to nearly its full value

Sir E Springing up Good heavens

Coyle I have found among my fathers papers a mortgage of that very
property to him

Sir E To your father My fathers agent

Coyle Yes bearing date the year after the great contested election
for the county on which the late Sir Edward patriotically spent sixty
thousand pounds for the honor of not being returned to Parliament

Sir E A mortgage on the Ravensdale estate But it must have been paid
off Mr Coyle anxiously have you looked for the release or the
receipt

Coyle Neither exists My fathers sudden death explains sufficiently I
was left in ignorance of the transaction but the seals on the deed and
the stamps are intact here it is sir Shows it

Sir E Sir do you know that if this be true I am something like a
beggar and your father something like a thief

Coyle I see the first plainly Sir Edward but not the second

Sir E Do you forget sir that your father was a charity boy fed
clothed by my father

Coyle Well Sir Edward

Sir E And do you mean to tell me sir that your father repaid that
kindness by robbing his benefactor

Coyle Certainly not but by advancing money to that benefactor when
he wanted it and by taking the security of one of his benefactors
estates as any prudent man would under the circumstances

Sir E Why then sir the benefactors property is yours Coyle Pardon
me the legal estate you have your equity of redemption You have only
to pay the money and the estate is yours as before

Sir E How dare you sir when you have just shown me that I cannot raise
five hundred pounds in the world Oh Florence why did I not listen to
you when you warned me against this man

Coyle Aside Oh she warned you did she Aloud I see one means at
least of keeping the Ravensdale estate in the family

Sir E What is it

Coyle By marrying your daughter to the mortgagee

Sir E To you

Coyle I am prepared to settle the estate on Miss Trenchard the day she
becomes Mrs Richard Coyle

Sir E Springing up You insolent scoundrel how dare you insult me in
my own house sir Leave it sir or I will have you kicked out by my
servants

Coyle I never take an angry man at his word Sir Edward Give a few
moments reflection to my offer you can have me kicked out afterwards

Sir E  Pacing stage A beggar Sir Edward Trenchard a beggar see my
children reduced to labor for their bread to misery perhaps but the
alternative Florence detests him still the match would save her
at least from ruin He might take the family name I might retrench
retire to the continent for a few years Florences health might
serve as a pretence Repugnant as the alternative is yet it deserves
consideration

Coyle Who has watched Now Sir Edward shall I ring for the servants
to kick me out

Sir E Nay Mr Coyle you must pardon my outburst you know I am hasty
and

Flo Without Papa dear Enters gaily starts on seeing Coyle Papa
pardon my breaking in on business but our American cousin has come
such an originaland we are only waiting for you to escort us to the
field

Sir E I will come directly my love Mr Coyle my dear you did not see
him

Flo Disdainfully Oh yes I saw him papa

Sir E Nay Florence your hand to Mr Coyle Aside I insist

Flo Papa Frightened at his look gives her hand Coyle attempts to
kiss it she snatches it away and crosses to L

Sir E Crosses to L Come Florence Mr Coyle we will join you in the
park Come my love take my arm Hurries her off L 1 E

Coyle Shallow selfish fool She warned you of me did she And you did
not heed her you shall both pay dearly She for her suspicions and
you that you did not share them Walks up and down How lucky the
seals were not cut from that mortgage when the release was given
Tis like the silly security of the Trenchards This mortgage makes
Ravensdale mine while the release that restores it to its owner lies in

Mrs M Oh I hardly know yet my dear We must study him I think if

Flo Reads One who still remembers what he ought long since to have
forgotten wishes to speak with Miss Trenchard Florence scratched
out on matters of life and death near the orel in the west
gallery Written upon a dirty sheet of paper in a hardly legible
hand What does this mean it opens like one of Mrs Radcliffes
romances Well here I am and now for my correspondent


Enter Murcott L


Mur Oh for one minutes clear head Miss Florence

Flo I presume you are the writer of this

Mur Yes I am

Flo You address me as an old acquaintance but I do not recognize you

Mur So much the better So much the better

Flo I hate mystery sir but you see I have come to rendezvous I must
know to whom I am speaking

Mur As frank as ever I am Abel Murcott

Flo Starting back You

Mur Do not be ashamed I have not the strength to injure you if I had
the evil In this shabby broken down drunkard you need not fear the
madman who years ago forgot in his frantic passion the gulf that lay
between your station and his own I am harmless except to my self

Flo Speak on sir I hear you

Mur I need not tell you by what steps I came to this you dont know
maybe you never knew what a maddening thing a passion is when it turns
against itself After being expelled from my tutorship in this house I
lost my employment self respect hope I sought to drown recollection
and draw courage from drink It only embittered remembrances and
destroyed the little courage I had left That I have bread to eat I
owe to Mr Coyle he employed me as his clerk You know he has been with
your father this morning I have come to tell you my errand are you as
brave as you used to be when I knew

Flo I fear nothing

Mur I come to tell you of your fathers ruin his utter ruin

Flo My fathers ruin What What

Mur His estates are mortgaged his creditors clamorous The Bailiffs
will be in Trenchard Manor today disguised as your own servants This
much Mr Coyle has conceded to your fathers respect for appearances

Flo Then beggary stares him in the face Poor father what a sad blow
for him Is that all sir

Mur No the worst remains

Flo Go on sir

Mur Coyle knows your fathers weakness and as a means of escape from
ruin to the verge of which he has brought him he has this day proposed
for your hand

Flo Mine

Mur On consideration of settling on you the Ravensdale Estate

Flo And my father how did he listen to such insolence

Mur You know as well as I do how he would hear such a proposal at first
a torrent of rage then the strong ebb of selfishness set in and
he consented to listen to the terms to view them as something to be
considered to consider them

Flo Good Heavens can this be true No I will not believe it of my
father and from such lips

Mur You have full right to think this and to say it but mark your
father and Coyle today You will then see if I speak truth or not

Flo Forgive my distrust Mr Murcott

Mur I am past taking offence or feeling scorn I have carried more than
can be heaped upon me but I did not come only to give you warning of
your danger

Flo Can you avert it

Asa Coming down between them Wal stranger thats just the question I
was going to ask

Flo You here sir and listening

Asa Wal it wasnt purpose I went in there to take a snooze I heard
you talking and I thought it wouldnt be polite of me not to listen to
what you had to say Im a rough sort of a customer and dont know much
about the ways of great folks But Ive got a cool head a stout arm
and a willing heart and I think I can help you just as one cousin
ought to help another

Flo Well I do think you are honest

Mur Shall I go on

Flo Yes we will trust him go on

Mur I found the Ravensdale mortgage while rumaging in an old deed box of
Coyles fathers there was a folded paper inside the deed I took both
to Coyle unopened like a besotted fool that I was My belief is strong
that the paper was the release of the mortgage that the money had been
paid off and the release executed without the seals having been cut
from the original mortgage I have known such things happen

Asa Have ye now Well if a Yankee lawyer had done such a thing he
would have Judge Lynch after him in no time

Mur You can but find that release we may unmask this diabolical fiend
and save you

Flo But surely a villain of Coyles stability would have destroyed the
paper the very keystone of his fraud

Mur I fear so

Asa Do you now wal youre wrong youre both wrong I guess you aint
either on you done much cyphering human nature The key stone of their
fraud is just the point your mighty cute rascals always leave unsecured
Come along with me stranger and well just work up this sum a little
two heads are better than one Yours is a little muddled but mines
pretty clear and if I dont circumvent that old sarpint Coyle

Flo Well

Asa Say I am a skunk thats all and thats the meanest kind of an
animal Exit L 1st E

Flo I owe you much Mr Murcott more than I can ever repay

Mur No no no if you did but know the hope of seeing you has roused
all the manhood that drink and misery has left me God bless you Miss
Florence

Flo No you dont call me Florence as you did when I was the truant
pupil and you the indulgent tutor Offers her hand

Mur No no for heavens sake do not call back that time or I shall go
mad mad mad Rushes off L 1 E followed by Florence

Mary What and leave my work Why when you first came here you thought
I could not be too industrious

Asa Well I think so yet Miss Mary but Ive got a heap to say to you
and I never can talk while youre moving about so spry among them pans
pails and cheeses First you raise one hand and then the other and
well it takes the gumption right our of me

Mary Brings sewing down Well then Ill sit heresits on bench

Asa Well no Miss Mary that wont do neither them eyes of yourn

anything that wasnt so tarnal neat and handsome that a fellow would
want to keep on doing nothing else all the time

Mary Well then Ill go away Rises

Asa Stopping her No dont do that Miss Mary for then Ill be left
in total darkness She sits Somehow I feel kinder lost if I havent
got you to talk to Now that Ive got the latitude and longitude of all
them big folks found out the length of every ladys foot and the
soft spot on everybodys head they cant teach me nothing but here
Whittling here I come to school

Mary Then throw away that stick and put away your knife like a good
boy Throws away stick up stage I must cure you of that dreadful
trick of whittling

Asa Oh if you only knew how it helps me to keep my eyes off you Miss
Mary

Mary But you neednt keep your eyes off me

Asa Im afraid I must my eyes are awful taletellers and they might be
saying something you wouldnt like to hear and that might make you mad
and then youd shut up school and send me home feeling about as small
as a tadpole with his tail bobbed off

Mary Dont be alarmed I dont think I will listen to any tales that
your eyes may tell unless theyre tales I like and ought to hear

Asa If I thought theyd tell any other Miss Mary I pluck them right
out and throw them in the first turnip patch I came to

Mary And now tell me more about your home in America Do you know Ive
listened to your stories until Im half a backwoodsmans wife already

Asa Aside Wouldnt I like to make her a whole one

Mary Yes I can shut my eyes and almost fancy I see your home in the
backwoods There are your two sisters running about in their sunbonnets

Asa Debby and Nan Yes

Mary Then I can see the smoke curling from the chimney then men and
boys working in the fields

Asa Yes

Mary The girls milking the cows and everybody so busy

Asa Yes

Mary And then at night home come your four big brothers from the hunt
laden with game tired and foot sore and covered with snow

Asa Thats so

Mary Then how we lasses bustle about to prepare supper The fire blazes
on the hearth while your good old mother cooks the slapjacks

Asa Getting very excited Yes

Mary And then after supper the lads and lasses go to a corn husking The
demijohn of old peach brandy is brought out and everything is so nice

Asa I shall faint in about five minutes Miss Mary youre a darned sight
too good for this country You ought to make tracks

Mary Make what

Asa Make tracks pack up and emigrate to the roaring old state of
Vermont and live long with mother Shed make you so comfortable and
there would be sister Debby and Nab and well I reckon Id be there
too

Mary Oh Im afraid if I were there your mother would find the poor
English girl a sad incumbrance

Asa Oh she aint proud not a mite besides theyve all seen Britishers
afore

Mary I suppose you allude to my cousin Edward Trenchard

Asa Well he want the only one there was the old Squire Mark
Trenchard

Mary Starting Aside My grandfather

Asa Oh he was a fine old hoss as game as a bison bull and as gray as
a coon in the fall you see he was kinder mad with his folks here so
he came over to America to look after the original branch of the family
thats our branch Were older than the Trenchards on this side of the
water Yes weve got the start of the heap

Mary Tell me Mr Trenchard did he never receive any letters from his
daughter

Asa Oh yes lots of them but the old cuss never read them though He
chucked them in the fire as soon as he made out who they come from

Mary Aside My poor mother

Asa You see as nigh as we could reckon it up she had gone and got
married again his will and that made him mad and well he was a queer
kind of a rusty fusty old coon and it appeared that he got older and
rustier and fustier and coonier every fall you see it always took him
in the fall it was too much for him He got took down with the ague he
was so bad the doctors gave him up and mother she went for a minister
and while she was gone the old man called me in his room come in Asa
boy says he and his voice rang loud and clear as a bell come in
says he Well I comed in sit down says he well I sot down You see
I was always a favorite with the old man Asa my boy says he takin
a great piece of paper when I die this sheet of paper makes you heir
to all my property in England Well you can calculate I pricked up my
ears about that time bimeby the minister came and I left the room
and I do believe he had a three days fight with the devil for that
old mans soul but he got the upper hand of satan at last and when
the minister had gone the old man called me into his room again The
old Squire was sitting up in his bed his face as pale as the sheet that
covered him his silken hair flowing in silvery locks from under his red
cap and the tears rolling from his large blue eyes down his furrowed
cheek like two mill streams Will you excuse my lighting a cigar For
the story is a long awful moveing and I dont think I could get on
without a smoke Strikes match Wal says he to me and his voice was
not as loud as it was aforeit was like the whisper of the wind in
a pine forest low and awful Asa boy said he I feel that Ive
sinned in hardening my heart against my own flesh and blood but I will
not wrong the last that is left of them give me the light says he
Wal I gave him the candle that stood by his bedside and he took the
sheet of paper I was telling you of just as I might take this Takes
will from pocket And he twisted it up as I might this Lights will
and he lights it just this way and he watched it burn slowly and slowly
away Then says he Asa boy that act disinherits you but it leaves
all my property to one who has a better right to it My own daughters
darling child Mary Meredith and then he smiled sank back upon his
pillow drew a long sigh as if he felt relieved and that was the last
of poor old Mark Trenchard

Mary Poor Grandfather Buries her face and sobs

Asa After bus Wal I guess Id better leave her alone Sees half
burned will There lies four hundred thousand dollars if theres a
cent Asa boy youre a hoss Starts off R 1 C

Mary To me all to me Oh Mr Trenchard how we have all wronged poor
grandfather What gone He felt after such tidings he felt I should be
left alonewho would suspect there was such delicacy under that rough
husk but I can hardly believe the startling newshis heiressI the
penniless orphan of an hour ago no longer penniless but alas an

Mrs M Dear obedient child De Boots has excellent expectations but
then they are only expectations after all This American is rich and
on the whole I think a well regulated affection ought to incline to Asa
Trenchard

Mrs M At the same time you must be cautious or in grasping at Asa
Trenchards solid good qualities you may miss them and De Boots
expectations into the bargain
