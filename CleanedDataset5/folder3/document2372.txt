THE WOMANHATERS


By Joseph C Lincoln




FOREWORD

By Way of Explanation

A story of mine called like this The WomanHaters appeared
recently in one of the magazines That story was not this one except in
partthe part dealing with John Brown and Miss Ruth Graham Readers
of the former tale who perhaps imagine they know all about Seth Atkins
and Mrs Emeline Bascom will be surprised to find they really know so
little The truth is that when I began to revise and rearrange the
magazine story for publication as a book new ideas came grew and
developed I discovered that I had been misinformed concerning the
lightkeepers past and present relations with the housekeeper at the
bungalow And there was Bennie D whom I had overlooked had not
mentioned at all and that rejuvenated craft the Daisy M and the
high tide which is or should be talked about in Eastboro even yet all
these I had omitted for the very good reason that I never knew of them
I have tried to be more careful this time During the revising process
The WomanHaters has more than doubled in length and let us hope in
accuracy Even now it is of course not a novel but merely a summer
farcecomedy a yarn And this by the way is all that it pretends to
be

CHAPTER I

MR SETH ATKINS


The stars like incandescent lights fed by a fast weakening dynamo grew
pale faded and one by one went out The slatecolored sea with its
tumbling waves changed color becoming a light gray then a faint blue
and as the red sun rolled up over the edge of the eastern horizon a
brilliant sapphire trimmed with a silver white on the shoals and along
the beach at the foot of the bluff

Seth Atkins keeper of the Eastboro TwinLights yawned stretched
and glanced through the seaward windows of the octagonshaped
glassenclosed room at the top of the north tower where he had spent
the night just passed Then he rose from his chair and extinguished the
blaze in the great lantern beside him Morning had come the mists had
rolled away and the dots scattered along the horizonschooners
tugs and coal barges for the most partno longer needed the glare
of Eastboro TwinLights to warn them against close proximity to
the dangerous shoalbordered coast Incidentally it was no longer
necessary for Mr Atkins to remain on watch He drew the curtains over
the polished glass and brass of the lantern yawned again and descended
the winding iron stairs to the door at the foot of the tower opened it
and emerged into the sandy yard

Crossing this yard before the small white house which the government
provided as a dwelling place for its lightkeepers he opened the door of
the south tower mounted the stairs there and repeated the extinguishing
process with the other lantern Before again descending to earth
however he stepped out on the iron balcony surrounding the light
chamber and looked about him

The view such as it was was extensive To the east the open sea
the wide Atlantic rolling lazily in the morning light a faint breeze
rippling the surfaces of the groundswell A few sails in sight far
out Not a sound except the hiss and splash of the surf which because
of a week of calms and light winds was low even for that time of
yearearly June

To the north stretched the shores of the back of the Cape High clay
bluffs rainwashed and wrinkled sloping sharply to the white sand
of the beach a hundred feet below Only one building except
those connected with the lighthouses near at hand this a small
grayshingled bungalow about two hundred yards away separated from the
lights by the narrow stream called Clam CreekSeth always spoke of it
as the Crickwhich turning in behind the long surfbeaten sandspit
known for some forgotten reason as Black Mans Point continued to
the saltwater pond which was named The Cove A path led down from the
lighthouses to a bend in the Crick and there on a small wharf was a
shanty where Seth kept his spare lobster and eelpots dory sails nets
and the like The dory itself with the oars in her was moored in the
cove

A mile off to the south the line of bluffs was broken by another
inlet the entrance to Pounddug Slough This poetically named channel
twisted and wound tortuously inland through salt marshes and between
mudbanks widening at last to become Eastboro Back Harbor a goodsized
body of water with the village of Eastboro at its upper end In the
old days when Eastboro amounted to something as a fishing port the
mackerel fleet unloaded its catch at the wharves in the Back Harbor
Then Pounddug Slough was kept thoroughly dredged and buoyed Now it was
weedgrown and neglected Only an occasional lobstermans dory traversed
its winding ways which the storms and tides of each succeeding winter
rendered more difficult to navigate The abandoned fish houses along its
shores were falling to pieces and at intervals the stranded hulk of
a fishing sloop or a little schooner rotting in the sun was a dismal
reminder that Eastboros ambitious young men no longer got their living
alongshore The town itself had gone to sleep awakening only in the
summer when the few cottagers came and the Bay Side Hotel was opened
for its short season

Behind the lighthouse buildings to the westand in the direction
of the villagewere five miles of nothing in particular A desolate
wilderness of rolling sanddunes beach grass huckleberry and bayberry
bushes cedar swamps and small clumps of pitchpines Through this
desert the three or four rutted crooked sand roads leading to and
from the lights turned and twisted Along their borders dwelt no human
being but life was there life in abundance Ezra Payne late assistant
keeper at the TwinLights was ready at all times to furnish evidence
concerning the existence of this life

My godfreys domino Ezra had exclaimed after returning from a drive
to Eastboro village I give you my word Seth they dummed nigh et
me alive They covered the horse all up so that he looked for all the
world like a sheep woolly I dont mind moskeeters in moderation but
when they roost on my eyelids and make em so heavy I cant open em
then Im ready to swear But I couldnt get even that relief because
every time I unbattened my mouth a million or so flew in and choked me
Thats what I saida million Some moskeeters are fat but these dont
get a square meal often enough to be anything but hideracks filled with
cussedness Moskeeters My godfreys domino

Ezra was no longer assistant lightkeeper He and his superior had
quarreled two days before The quarrel was the culmination on Ezras
part of a gradually developing grouch brought on by the loneliness of
his surroundings After a night of duty he had marched into the house
packed his belongings in a battered canvas extension case and announced
his intention of resigning from the service

To the everlastin brimstone with the job he snarled addressing Mr
Atkins who partially dressed emerged from the bedroom in bewilderment
and sleepy astonishment To thunder with it I say Ive had all the
govment jobs I want Lifesavin service was bad enough trampin the
condemned beach in a howlin notheaster with the sand cuttin
furrers in your face and the icicles on your mustache so heavy you
got roundshouldered luggin em But when your tramp was over you had
somebody to talk to Here by godfreys there aint nothin nor nobody
Im goin fishin again where I can be sociable

Humph commented Seth you must be lonesome all to once Aint my
company good enough for you

Company A heap of company you are When Im awake youre asleep and
snorin and

I never snored in my life was the indignant interruption

What YOULL snore when youre dead and wake up the whole graveyard
Lonesome he continued without giving his companion a chance to
retort lonesome aint no name for this place No company but green
flies and them moskeeters and nothin to look at but salt water and
sand andanddummed if I can think of anything else Five miles from
town and the only house in sight shut tight When I come here you told
me that bungalow was opened up every year

So it has been till this season

And that picnics come here every once in a while

Dont expect picnickers to be such crazy loons as to come here in
winter time do you

I dont know If theyre fools enough to come here ANY time I wouldnt
be responsible for em There aint so many moskeeters in winter But
just LOOK at this hole Just put on your specs and LOOK at it Not a
manbut younot a woman not a child not a girl

Ah ha ah ha NOW were gettin at it Not a girl Thats whats the
matter with you You want to be up in the village where you can go
courtin Youre too fur from Elsie Peters thats where the shoe
pinches Ive heard how you used to set out in her dads backyard with
your arm round her waist lookin at each other mushy as a couple of
sassers of hastypuddin Bah Ill take care my next assistant aint
girlstruck

Girlstruck Id enough sight ruther be girlstruck than always ravin
and rippin against females And all because some woman way back in
Methusalems time had sense enough to heave you over At least thats
what everybody callates must be the reason You pretend to be a
womanhater All round this part of the Cape youve took pains to get up
that kind of reputation but

There aint no pretendin about it Ive got brains enough to keep
clear of petticoats And when you get to be as old as I be and know as
much as I dothough that aint no ways likely even if you live to be
nine hundred and odd like Noah in Scriptureyoull feel the same way

Aw come off Womanhater You hate women same as the boy at the
poorhouse hated ice creamcause there aint none around Why I
wouldnt trust you as fur as I could see you

This was the end of the dialogue because Mr Payne was obliged to break
off his harangue and dodge the stovelifter flung at him by the outraged
lightkeeper As the lifter was about to be followed by the teakettle
Ezra took to his heels bolted from the house and began his long tramp
to the village When he reached the first clumps of bayberry bushes
bordering the deeply rutted road a joyful cloud of mosquitoes rose and
settled about him like a fog

So Seth Atkins was left alone to do double duty at Eastboro TwinLights
pending the appointment of another assistant The two days and nights
following Ezras departure had been strenuous and provoking Doing
all the housework preparation of meals included tending both lights
rubbing brass work sweeping and scouring sleeping when he could and
keeping awake when he must nobody to talk to nobody to helpthe
fortyeight hours of solitude had already convinced Mr Atkins that the
sooner a helper was provided the better At times he even wished the
disrespectful Payne back again wished that he had soothed instead of
irritated the departed one Then he remembered certain fragments of
their last conversation and wished the stovelifter had been flung with
better aim

Now standing on the gallery of the south tower he was conscious of
a desire for breakfast Preparing that meal had been a part of his
assistants duties Now he must prepare it himself and he was hungry
and sleepy He mentally vowed that he would no longer delay notifying
the authorities of the desertion and would urge them to hurry in
sending some one to fill the vacant place

Grumbling aloud to himself he moved around the circle of the gallery
toward the door His hand was on the latch when turning he cast
another glance over the rail this time directly downward toward the
beach below And there he saw something which caused him to forget
hunger and grievances of all kinds something which after one horrified
look to make sure led him to dart into the light chamber spring at a
reckless gait down the winding stair out of the tower rush to the edge
of the bluff and plunge headlong down the zigzag path worn in the clay

On the sand at the foot of the bluff below the lights just beyond
reach of the wash of the surf lay a man or the dead body of a man
stretched at full length




CHAPTER II

MR JOHN BROWN


Once before during his years of service as keeper of Eastboro
TwinLights had Seth seen such a sight as that which now caused him to
make his dash for the shore Once before after the terrible storm of
1905 when the great steamer Bay Queen went down with all on board the
exact spot of her sinking unknown even to this day Then the whole ocean
side of the Cape from Race Point to Orham was strewn with ghastly
relics But the Bay Queen met her fate in the winter season amid a gale
such as even the oldest residents could not remember Now it was early
summer the night before had been a flat calm There had been no wreck
or the lifesavers would have told him of it There would be no excuse
for a wreck anyway

All this in disjointed fragments passed through the lightkeepers
mind as he descended the path in frantic bounds and plowed through
the ankledeep white sand of the beach As he approached the recumbent
figure he yelled a panted Hi there He did not expect the hail to be
answered or even noticed Therefore he was pleasantly disappointed when
the figure rolled over raised itself on one elbow looked at him in a
dazed sort of way and replied cheerfully but faintly Hello

Seth stopped short put a hand to the breast of his blue flannel shirt
and breathed a mighty sigh of relief

Gosh he exclaimed with fervor Then changing his labored gallop
for a walk he continued his progress toward the man who as if his
momentary curiosity was satisfied lay down again He did not rise when
the lightkeeper reached his side but remained quiet looking up from a
pair of gray eyes and smiling slightly with lips that were blue He was
a stranger to Atkins a young fellow rather good looking dressed in
blue serge trousers negligee shirt blue socks and without shoes
or hat His garments were soaked and the salt water dripped from his
shoulders to the sand The lightkeeper stared at him and he returned
the stare

Gosh repeated Seth after an instant of silence Jiminy crimps I
feel better

The strangers smile broadened Glad to hear it Im sure he said
slowly So do I though theres still room for improvement What was
your particular ailment Mine seems to have been water on the brain

He sat up and shakily ran a hand through his wet hair as he spoke
Atkins his surprise doubled by this extraordinary behavior could think
of nothing to say

Good morning continued the young man as if the meeting had been the
most casual and ordinary possible I think you said a moment ago that
you were feeling better No relapse I trust

Relapse What in the world Are you crazy I aint sick

Thats good I must have misunderstood you Pleasant morning isnt it

Pleasant mornWhy say IIwhat in time are you doin layin there
all soaked through You scared me pretty nigh to death I thought you
was drowned sure and sartin

Did you Well to be honest so did I for a while In fact Im not
absolutely sure that Im not even yet Youll excuse me if I lie down
again wont you I never tried a seaweed pillow before but it isnt so
bad

He again stretched himself on the sand Seth shook his head

Well if this dont beat me he exclaimed Youre the coolest critter
that ever II

I am cool admitted the young man with a slight shiver This
stretch of ocean here isnt exactly a Turkish bath Ive been swimming
sincewell an hour or two ago and I am just a little chilled

He shivered again

Swimmin An hour or two Where on earth did you come from

Oh I fell overboard from a steamer off here somewhere I

Another and emphatic shiver caused him to pause The lightkeeper awoke
to the realities of the situation

Good land of love he exclaimed What am I thinkin of Seein you
this way and you talkin so kind of everyday and funny drove my senses
clean out I guess Get right up off that wet place this minute Come up
to the house quick Can you walk

Dont know I am willing to try Would you mind giving me a lift

Seth didnt mind which was fortunate as his new acquaintance couldnt
have risen unaided His knees shook under him when he stood erect and
he leaned heavily on the lightkeepers arm

Steady now counselled Atkins no hurry Take it easy If youve
navigated water all alone for hours I callate between us we can manage
to make a fiveminute cruise on dry land    Even if the course we
steer would make an eel lame tryin to follow it he added as the
castaway staggered and reeled up the beach Now dont try to talk Let
your tongue rest and give your feet a chance

The climbing of the steep bluff was a struggle but they accomplished
it and at length the stranger was seated in a chair in the kitchen

Now the fust thing observed Seth is to get them wet clothes
off you Usually Id have a good fire here but that miserable Ezry
hasthat is my assistants left me and I have to go it alone as
you might say So well get you to bed and    No you cant undress
yourself neither Set still and Ill have you peeled in a jiffy

His guest was making feeble efforts to remove his socks Atkins pushed
him back into the chair and stripped the blue and dripping rags from
feet which were almost as blue from cold The castaway attempted a weak
resistance but gave it up and said with a whimsical smile

Im mightily obliged to you I never realized before that a valet was
such a blessing Most of mine have been confounded nuisances

Hey queried Seth looking up

Nothing Pardon me for comparing you with a valet

Land sakes I dont care what you call me I was out of my head once
myselftyphoid fever twasand they say the things I called the doctor
was somethin scandalous You aint responsible Youre beat out and
your brains weak like the rest of you Now hold on till I get you a
nightgown

He started for the bedroom The young man seemed a bit troubled

Just a minute he observed Dont you think I had better move to
a less conspicuous apartment The door is open and if any of your
neighbors should happen byany ladies for instance I

Ladies Mr Atkins regarded him frowningly In the fust place there
aint a neighbor nighern four miles and in the next Id have you
understand no women come to this house If you knew me better young
feller youd know that Set where you be

The nightshirt was one of the lightkeepers own and although Seth was
a goodsized man it fitted the castaway almost too tightly for comfort
However it was dry and warm and by leaving a button or two unfastened
at the neck answered the purpose well enough The stranger was piloted
to the bedroom assisted into the depths of a feather bed and covered
with several layers of blankets and patchwork quilts

There observed Seth contentedly now you go to sleep If you get to
sweatin so much the better Twill get some of that cold water out of
you So long

He departed closing the door after him Then he built a fire in the
range got breakfast ate it washed the dishes and continued his
forenoons work Not a sound from the bedroom Evidently the strange
arrival had taken the advice concerning going to sleep But all the time
he was washing dishes rubbing brass work or sweeping Mr Atkinss
mind was busy with the puzzle which fate had handed him Occasionally he
chuckled and often he shook his head He could make nothing out of
it One thing only was certainhe had never before met a human being
exactly like this specimen

It was half past twelve before there were signs of life in the bedroom
Seth was setting the table for dinner when the door of the room opened
a little way and a voice said

I say are you there

I be What do you want

Would you mind telling me what youve done with my clothes

Not a bit Ive got em out on the line and they aint dry yet If
youll look on the chair by the souwest window youll find a rigout of
mine Im afraid twill fit you too quickyoure such an elephantbut
Ill risk it if you will

Apparently the stranger was willing to risk it for in a few moments
he appeared dressed in the Atkins Sunday suit of blue cloth and with
Seths pet carpet slippers on his feet

Hello was the lightkeepers greeting How you feelinbetter

Tip top thank you Where do you wash when its necessary

Basin right there in the sink Soap in the becket over top of it
Roller towel on the closet door Aint you had water enough for a
spell

Not fresh water thank you Im caked with salt from head to foot

Does make a feller feel like a split herrin if he aint used to it
Think you can eat anything

Can I The response was enthusiastic You watch me My last meal was
yesterday noon

Yesterday NOON Didnt you eat no supper

No

Why not

Well Iwell to be frank because I hadnt the price It took my last
cent to pay my fare on that blessed steamer

Great land of love What time was it when you fell overboard

Oh I dont know Two oclock perhaps

Two oclock What was you doin up at two oclock Why wasnt you in
your stateroom asleep

I hadnt any stateroom Staterooms cost money

My soul And you swum three hours on an empty stomach

Not altogether Part of it on my back But if youll excuse
familiarity on short acquaintance those things youre cooking smell
good to me

Thems clam fritters and if YOULL excuse my sayin so that
shouldnt they ARE good Set down and fill up

The visitor ate nine of the fritters a slice of driedapple pie and
drank two cups of coffee Seth between intervals of frying and eating
watched him with tremendous curiosity and as much patience as he could
muster When the pie was finished he asked the first of the questions
with which he had been bursting all the forenoon

Tell me he said howd you come to fall overboard

Im not very certain just how it happened I remember leaning over the
rail and watching the waves Then I was very dizzy all at once The next
thing I knew I was in the water

Dizzy hey Seasick may be

I guess not Im a pretty good sailor Im inclined to think the cause
was that empty stomach you mentioned

Umhm You didnt have no supper Still you ate the noon afore

Not much Only a sandwich

A sandwich What did you have for breakfast

Well the fact is I overslept and decided to omit the breakfast

Gosh no wonder you got dizzy If I went without meals for a whole
day I callate Id be worse than dizzy What did you do when you found
yourself in the water

Yelled at first but no one heard me Then I saw some lights off in
this direction and started to swim for them I made the shore finally
but I was so used up that I dont remember anything after the landing
Think I took a nap

I presume likely Wonder twasnt your everlastin nap Tut tut tut
Think of it

I dont want to thank you It isnt pleasant enough to think of Im
here andby the way where IS here

This is Eastboro townshipEastboro Cape Cod Them lights out there
are Eastboro TwinLights Im the keeper of em My names Atkins Seth
Atkins

Delighted to meet you Mr Atkins And tremendously obliged to you
besides

You neednt be I aint done nothin Let me see you said your name
was

Did I The young man seemed startled almost alarmed When

Seth was embarrassed but not much Well he admitted I dont knows
you did say it come to think of it What IS your name

My name

Yes

Oh whymy name is BrownerJohn Brown Not the gentleman who was
hanged of course distant relative thats all

Hum John Brown hey What steamer did you fall off of

WhywhyI cant seem to remember Thats odd isnt it

Yes I should say twas Where was she bound

Bound Oh you mean where was she going

Sartin

I thinkI think she was going toto    Humph how strange this
is

What

Why that I should forget all these things

The lightkeeper regarded his guest with suspicion

Yaas he drawled slowly when you call it strange you aint
exaggeratin none wuth mentionin I spose he added after a moment
during which he stared intently at Mr Brown who smiled in polite
acknowledgment of the stare I spose likely you couldnt possibly
remember what port you hailed from

I suppose not was the calm reply

Seth rose from the table

Well he observed Ive been up all night too and its past my
bedtime As I told you my assistants left all of a sudden and Im
alone in charge of govment property I ought to turn in but he
hesitated

John Brown also rose

Mr Atkins he said my memory seems to be pretty bad but I havent
forgotten everything For instance his smile disappeared and his tone
became earnest I can remember perfectly well that Im not a crook
that I havent done anything to be ashamed ofas I see itthat Im
very grateful to you and that I dont steal If you care to believe
that and also that being neither a sneak or a thief I shant clear
out with the spoons while youre asleep you mightwell you might risk
turning in

The lightkeeper did not answer immediately The pair looked each other
straight in the eye

Then Seth yawned and turned toward the bedroom

Ill risk it he said curtly If I aint awake by six oclock I
wish youd call me Youll find some spare clay pipes and tobacco on the
mantelpiece by the clock So long

He entered the bedroom and closed the door Mr Brown stepped over to
the mantel and helped himself to a pipe




CHAPTER III

MR BROWN PUTS IN AN APPLICATION


At half past five the lightkeeper opened the bedroom door and peeped
out The kitchen was empty There was no sign of Mr Brown It took Seth
just four minutes to climb into the garments he had discarded and reach
the open air His guest was seated on the bench beside the house one of
the clay pipes in his hand He was looking out to sea He spoke first

Hello he said Youre up ahead of time arent you It isnt six
yet

Atkins grinned No he answered taint not quite But sence Ezry
cleared out Ive been a kind of human alarm clock as you might say
Feelin all right are you

Yes thank you I say holding up the pipe and regarding it
respectfully is this tobacco of yours furnished by the government

No Some I bought myself last time I was over to the Center Why
whats the matter with it Aint it good

Perhaps so

Then what made you ask Aint it strong enough

Strong enough Youre disposed to be sarcastic Its stronger than I
am What do they flavor it withtar

Say lets see that plug THAT aint smokin tobacco

What is it thenasphalt

Why haw haw Thats a piece of Ezrys chewin Some he left when he
went away Its Honest Friend TIS flavored up considerble And you
tried to smoke it Ho ho

The young man joined in the laugh

That explains why it bubbled so he said I used twentytwo matches
by actual count and then gave it up Bah he smacked his lips
disgustedly and made a face Honest Friendis that the name of it
Meaning that itll stick to you through life I presume Water has no
effect on the taste Ive tried it

Maybe some supper might help Ill wash the dinner dishes and start
gettin it All there seems to be to this job of mine just now is
washin dishes And how I hate it

He reentered the kitchen Then he uttered an exclamation

Why whats become of the dishes he demanded I left em here on the
table

Brown arose from the bench and sauntered to the door

I washed them he said I judged that you would have to if I didnt
and it seemed the least I could do everything considered

Sho You washed the dishes hey Whered you put em

In the closet there Thats where they belong isnt it

Seth went to the closet took a plate from the pile and inspected it

Um he grunted turning the plate over that aint such a bad job
Not so allfired bad for a green hand What did you wash em with

A cloth I found hanging by the sink

I see Yes yes And you wiped em onwhat

Well to tell you the truth I didnt see any towels in sight except
that one on the door and for various reasons I judged that wasnt a
dish towel

Good judgment Tisnt Go on

So I hunted around and in the closet in the parlor or living room or
whatever you call it I found a whole stack of things that looked like
towels so I used one of those

Is this it Seth picked up a damp and bedraggled cloth from the table

Thats it I should have hung it up somewhere I suppose Ill lose my
job if I dont look out

Um Well Im much obliged to you only

Only

Only you washed them dishes with the sink cloth and wiped em with a
piller case

The volunteer dishwashers mouth opened

NO he gasped

Yaas

A pillow case Well by George

Umhm I jedge you aint washed many dishes in your lifetime

Not so very many No

They looked at each other and burst into a roar of laughter Brown was
the first to recover

Well he observed I guess its up to me If youll kindly put me
next to a genuine cloth or sponge or whatever is the proper caper for
dishwashing Ill undertake to do them over again And for heavens
sake lock up the pillow cases

Seth protested declaring that the dishes need not be rewashed that very
minute and that when he got a chance he would do them himself But the
young man was firm and at last the lightkeeper yielded

Its real kind of you he declared and bein as Ive considerble
to do I dont know but Ill let you Heres a couple of dishcloths and
theres the towels Im goin out to see to the lights and Ill be back
pretty soon and get supper

Later in the evening after supper the housework done they sat again
on the bench beside the door each with a pipe filled this time
with genuine smoking tobacco Before and below them was the quiet sea
rolling lazily under the stars Overhead the big lanterns in the towers
thrust their parallel lances of light afar into the darkness The
only sounds were the low wash of the surf and the hum of the eager
mosquitoes Brown was silent alternately puffing at the pipe and
slapping at the insects which latter apparently finding his skin
easier to puncture than that of the tanned and leathery Atkins were
making the most of their opportunity

Seth whose curiosity had been checked but not smothered by his
companions evident desire to say nothing concerning himself was busy
thinking of various guileful schemes with which to entrap the castaway
into the disclosure of his identity Having prepared his bait he
proceeded to get over a line

Mr Brown he said I aint mentioned it to you afore count of your
needin rest and grub and all after your fallin overboard last night
But tomorrer youll be feelin fustrate again and I callate youll be
wantin to get word to your folks Now we can telephone to the Eastboro
depot where theres a telegraph and the depot masterll send a
dispatch to your people lettin em know youre all safe and sound If
youll just give me the address and what you want to say Ill tend
to it myself The depot masters a good friend of mine and hell risk
sending the dispatch collect if I tell him to

Thank you replied Brown shortly

Oh dont mention it Now wholl I send it to

You neednt send it I couldnt think of putting you to further
trouble

Trouble Taint no trouble to telephone Land sakes I do it four or
five times a day Now wholl I send it to

You neednt send it

Oh well of course if youd ruther send it yourself

I shant send it It really isnt worth while phoning or telegraphing
either I didnt drown and Im very comfortable thank youor should
be if it werent for these mosquitoes

Comftable Yes youre comftable but how about your folks Wont
they learn soons that steamer gets intointo PortlandororNew
York or Bostonor    Hey

I didnt speak

Seth swallowed hard and continued Well wherever she was bound he
snapped Wont they learn that you sot sail in her and never got there
Then theyll know that you MUST have fell overboard

John Brown drew a mouthful of smoke through the stem of the pipe and
blew it spitefully among the mosquitoes

I dont see how theyll learn it he replied

Why the steamer folksll wire em right off

Theyll have to find them first

Thatll be easy enough Therell be your name John Brown of such
and such a place written right on the pursers book wont it

No drawled Mr Brown it wont

The lightkeeper felt very much as if this particular road to the truth
had ended suddenly in a blind alley He pulled viciously at his chin
whiskers His companion shifted his position on the bench Silence fell
again as much silence as the mosquitoes would permit

Suddenly Brown seemed to reach a determination

Atkins he said briskly and with considerable bitterness in his tone
dont you worry about my people They dont know where I am andwell
some of them at least dont care Maybe Im a rolling stoneat any
rate I havent gathered any moss any financial moss Im broke I
havent any friends any that I wish to remember I havent any job
I am what you might call down and out If I had drowned when I fell
overboard last night it might have been a good thingor it might not
We wont argue the question because just now Im ready to take either
side But lets talk about yourself Youre lightkeeper here

I be yes

And these particular lights seem to be a good way from everywhere and
everybody

Five mile from Eastboro Center sixteen from Denboro and two from the
nighest life savin station Why

Oh just for instance No neighbors you said

Nary one

I noticed a bungalow just across the brook here It seems to be shut
up Who owns it

Bungawhich Oh that cottage over on tother side the crick That
blongs to a couple of paintin fellers from up Boston way Not house
painters you understand but fellers that put in their time paintin
pictures of the water and the beach and the like of that Seems a pretty
silly job for grownup men but theyre real pleasant and folksy Dont
put on no airs nor nothin Theyre most genrally here every June and
July and August but I understand they aint comin this year so the
cottagell be shut up Ill miss em kind of One of ems name is
Graham and tothers Hamilton

I see Many visitors to the lights

Not many Once in a while a picnic comes over in a livery fourseater
but not often The same gang never comes twice Roads too bad and they
complain like fury about the moskeeters

Do they How peevish Atkins youre not married

It was an innocent question but it had an astonishing effect The
lightkeeper bounced on the bench as if someone had kicked it violently
from beneath

What he quavered shrilly Whawhats that

Brown was surprised I asked if you were married thats all he said
I cant see

Stop Seths voice shook and he bent down to glare through the
darkness at his companions face Stop he ordered You asked me if I
wasmarried

Yes Why shouldnt I

Why shouldnt you See here young feller youyouwhat made you ask
that

What made me

Stop sayin my words after me Are you a man or a pollparrot Cant
you understand plain United States language What made you Or WHO made
you Who told you to ask me that question

He pounded the bench with his fist The pair stared at each other for a
moment then Brown leaned back and began to whistle Seth seized him by
the shoulders

Quit that foolishness dyou hear he snarled Quit it and answer
me

The answer was prefaced by a pitying shake of the head

Its the mosquitoes observed the young man musingly They get
through and puncture the brain after a time I presume Im not
surprised exactly but with a sigh Im very sorry

What are you talkin about demanded Atkins Be you crazy

Noo IM not

YOURE not Do you mean that I am

Well slowly Im not an expert in such cases but when a perfectly
simple commonplace question sets a chap to pounding and screaming and
offering violence thenwell its either insanity or an attempt at
insult one or the other Ive given you the benefit of the doubt

He scratched a match on his heel and relit his pipe The lightkeeper
still stared suspicious and puzzled Then he drew a long breath

II didnt mean to insult you he stammered

Glad to hear it Im sure If I were you however I should see a
doctor for the other trouble

And I aint crazy neither I beg your pardon for hollerin and
grabbin hold of you

Granted

Thank ye Now hesitatingly would you mind tellin me why you asked
me if I was married

Not in the least I asked merely because it occurred to me that you
might be Of course I had seen nothing of your wife but it was
barely possible that she was away on a visit or somewhere There is no
regulation forbidding lightkeepers marryingat least I never heard of
anyand so I asked thats all

Seth nodded I see he said slowly yes yes I see So you didnt
have no special reason

I did not Of course if I had realized that you were subject
toerfits I should have been more careful

Hum    Well II beg your pardon again II am kind of touchy on
some pints Didnt I tell you no women came here Married A wife Do I
look like a dum fool

Not now

Well then And Ive apologized for bein one a few minutes ago aint
I

Yes you have No grudge on my part I assure you Lets forget it and
talk of something else

They did but the dialogue was rather jerky Brown was thinking and
Atkins seemed moody and disinclined to talk After a time he announced
that it was getting late and he callated he would go up to the light
room Youd better turn in he added rising

Just a minute said the young man Wait just a minute Atkins
suppose I asked you another questionwould you become violent at once
or merely by degrees

Seth frowned The suspicious look returned to his face

Humph he grunted Depended on what you asked me maybe

Yes Well this one is harmlessat least I hope it is I thought the
other was also but I    There there be calm Sit down again and
listen This question is nothing like that Its about that assistant of
yours the chap who left a day or two before I drifted in What were his
duties What did he have to do when he was here

Waal drawled Seth with sarcasm resuming his seat on the bench he
was SUPPOSED to do considerble many things Stand watch and watch
with me and scrub brass and clean up around and sweep and wash dishes
andandwell make himself genrally useful Them was the duties he
was supposed to have What he done was diffrent Pesky loafer Why

Thats what Im going to tell you Have they appointed his successor
yet Have you got any one to take his place

No Fact is Id ought to have telegraphed right off to the Board but
I aint I was so glad to see the last of him that I kept puttin it
off Ill do it tomorrer

Perhaps you wont need to

Course Ill need to Why not Got to have somebody to help Thats
rules and regulations and besides I cant keep awake day and night
too What makes you think I wont need to

The young man knocked the ashes from his pipe Rising he laid a hand on
his companions shoulder

Because youve got an assistant right here on the premises he said
Delivered by the Atlantic express right at your door Far be it from
me to toot my horn Mr Atkins or to proclaim my merits from the
housetops But speaking as one discerning person to another when it
comes to an A1 first chop lightkeepers assistant I ask Whats the
matter with yours truly John Brown

Seths reply was not in words The hand holding his pipe fell limp upon
his lap and he stared at the speaker The latter entirely unabashed
waved an airy gesture and continued

I repeat he said Whats the matter with John Brown And echo
answers Hes all right I am a candidate for the position of
assistant keeper at Eastboro TwinLights

YOU

Me

Butbutaw go on Youre foolin

Not a fool I mean it I am here Im green but in the sunshine of
your experience I agree to ripen rapidly I can wash dishesyouve seen
me I believe I could scrub brass and sweep

You wantin to be assistant at a place like this YOU an edicated
able young chap thats been used to valets and servants and

Why do you say that How do you know Ive been used to those things

Cause as I hinted to you a spell ago I aint altogether a dum fool
I can put two and two together and make four without having the example
done for me on a blackboard Youre a rich mans son youve been used
to sassiety and city ways and good clothes YOU wantin to put in your
days and nights in a forsaken hole like this Nonsense Get out

But Mr Brown refused to get out

No nonsense about it he declared It is the hand of Fate With the
whole broadside of Cape Cod to land upon why was I washed ashore just
at this particular spot AnswerBecause at this spot at this time
Eastboro TwinLights needed an assistant keeper I like the spot It
is beautiful Far from the madding crowds ignoble strife With your
permission Ill stay here The leopard may or may not change his
spots but I shant I like this one and here I stay Yes I mean it I
stayas your assistant Come what do you say Is it a go

The lightkeeper rose once more Im goin on watch he said with
decision You turn in Youll feel better in the mornin

He started towards the tower But John Brown sprang from the bench and
followed him

Not until youve answered my question he declared AM I to be your
assistant

No course you aint Its dum foolishness Besides I aint got the
say the government hires its own keepers

But you can square the government That will be easy Why with a
modest gesture look what the government is getting It will jump at
the chance Atkins you must say yes

I shant neither Let go of my arm Its blame foolishness I tell
you Why impatiently course its foolishness I dont know the first
thing about you

What of it I dont know anything about you either

Again the lightkeeper seemed unaccountably agitated He stopped in his
stride and whirled to face his companion

What do you mean by that he demanded fiercely Before the young man
could reply he turned again strode to the door of the light flung
it open and disappeared within The door closed behind him with a
thunderous bang

John Brown gazed after him in bewilderment Then he shrugged his
shoulders and returned to the bench

The surf at the foot of the bluff grumbled and chuckled wickedly as if
it knew all of poor humanitys secrets and found a cynics enjoyment in
the knowledge




CHAPTER IV

THE COMING OF JOB


The next morning Seth was gloomy and uncommunicative At the breakfast
table when Brown glanced up from his plate he several times caught
the lightkeeper looking intently at him with the distrustful
halfsuspicious gaze of the night before Though quite aware of this
scrutiny he made no comment upon it until the meal was nearly over
then he observed suddenly

Its all right you neednt

Neednt what demanded Atkins in astonishment

Look at me as if you expected me to explode at any minute I shant
Im not loaded

Seth colored under his coat of sunburn and seemed embarrassed

I dont know what youre talkin about he stammered Have the
moskeeters affected YOUR brains

No My brains such as they are are all right and I want to keep them
so Thats why I request you not to look at me in that way

How was I lookin at you I dont know what you mean

Yes you do You are wondering how much I know I dont know anything
and Im not curious Thats the truth Now why not let it go at that

See here young feller I

No you see here Im not an Old Sleuth I havent any ambitions that
way I dont know anything about youwhat youve been what youve
done

Done Seth leaned across the table so suddenly that he upset his
chair Done he cried what do you mean by that Who said Id done
anything Its a lie

What is a lie

Whywhyerwhatever they said

Who said

Why the ones thatthat said what you said they said

I didnt say anyone had said anything

Then what do you mean byby hintin Hey What do you mean by it

He brandished a clenched fist over the breakfast dishes Brown leaned
back in his chair and closed his eyes

Call me when the patient recovers his senses he drawled wearily
This delirium is painful to a sensitive nature

Atkinss fist wavered in midair opened and was drawn across its
owners forehead

Well by jiminy exclaimed the lightkeeper with emphasis this
isis    I guess I BE crazy If I aint you are Would you mind
tellin me what in time you mean by THAT

It is not the mosquitoes continued his companion in apparent
soliloquy there are no mosquitoes at present It must be the other
thing of course But so early in the morning and so violent Alcohol
is

SHUT UP It was not a request but an order Brown opened his eyes

You were addressing me he asked blandly Yes

Addressin you For thunder sakes who else would I be ad   
There there Now I callate youre hintin that Im drunk I aint

Indeed

Yes indeed And I aint out of my headnot yet though keepin
company with a Bedlamite may have some effect I shouldnt wonder Mr
John Brownif thats your name which I doubtyou listen to me

Very well Mr Seth Atkinsif that is your name which I neither doubt
nor believe not being particularly interestedIm listening Proceed

You told me last night that you wanted the job of assistant keeper here
at these lights Course you didnt mean it

I did

You DID    Well YOU must be drunk or loony

Im neither And I meant it I want the job

Seth looked at him and he looked at Seth At length the lightkeeper
spoke again

Well he said slowly I dont understand it at all but never mind
Whatever happens weve got to understand each other Mind I dont say
the jobs yours even if we do but we cant even think of it unless we
understand each other plain To begin with I want to tell you that I
aint done nothin thats crooked nor wicked nor nothin but what I
think is right and what Id do over again Do you believe that

Certainly As I told you Im not interested but Ill believe it with
pleasure if you wish me to

I dont wish nothin Youve GOT to believe it And whether you stay
here ten minutes or ten years youve got to mind your own business I
wont have any hints or questions about mefrom you nor nobody else
Mind your own business thats the motto of Eastboro TwinLights
while Im boss of em If you dont like itwell the village is only
five mile off and Ill pint out the road to you

He delivered this ultimatum with extraordinary energy Then he reached
for his overturned chair set it on its legs and threw himself into it
Well he demanded after a moment what do you say to that

Hurrah replied Mr Brown cheerfully

Hurrah For the land sakes    Say CANT you talk sensible if you
try real hard and set your mind to it What is there to hurrah about

Everything The whole situation Atkins Brown leaned forward now and
spoke with earnestness I like your motto It suits me Mind your own
business suits me down to the ground It proves that you and I were
made to work together in a place just like this

Does hey I want to know

You do know Why just think each of us has pleaded not guilty
Weve done nothingwere entirely innocentand we want to forget it
I agree not to ask you how old you are nor why you wear your brand of
whiskers nor how you like them nornor anything I agree not to ask
questions at all

Humph but you asked some last night

Purely by accident You didnt answer them You asked me some also
if you will remember and I didnt answer them either Good We forget
everything and agree not to do it again

Ugh I tell you I aint done nothin

I know Neither have I Let the dead past be its own undertaker so
far as we are concerned Im honest Atkins and tolerably straight I
believe you are I really do But we dont care to talk about ourselves
thats all And fortunately kind Providence has brought us together in
a place where theres no one else TO talk I like you I credit you with
good taste therefore you must like me

Hey Ho ho Seth laughed in spite of himself Young man he
observed you aint cultivated your modesty under glass have you

Brown smiled Joking aside he said I dont see why I shouldnt in
time make an ideal assistant lightkeeper Give me a trial at any rate
I need an employer you need a helper Here we both are Come it is a
bargain isnt it Any brass to be scrubbedboss


Of course had Eastboro TwinLights been an important station the
possibility of John Browns remaining there would have been nonexistent
If it had been winter or even early spring or fall a regular assistant
would have been appointed at once and the castaway given his walking
papers If Seth Atkins had not been Seth Atkins particular friend of
the district superintendent matters might have been different But the
Eastboro lights were unimportant merely a halfway mark between Orham
on the one hand and the powerful Seaboard Heights beacon on the other
It was the beginning of summer when wrecks almost never occurred And
the superintendent liked Seth and Seth liked him So although Mr
Atkins still scoffed at his guests becoming a permanent fixture at the
lights and merely consented after more parley to see if he couldnt
arrange for him to hang around and help a spell until somebody else was
sent the conversation with the superintendent over the long distance
phone resulted more favorably for Brown than that nonchalant young
gentleman had a reasonable right to expect

The Lord knows who I can send you now Atkins said the
superintendent I cant think of a man anywhere that can be spared If
you can get on for a day or two longer Ill try to get a helper down
but where hes coming from I dont see

Then Seth sprung the news that he had a sort of helper already Hes
a likely young chap enough admitted the lightkeeper whispering the
words into the transmitter in order that the likely young chap might
not hear but hes purty green yet He wants the reglar job and give
me time enough I callate I can break him in Yes Im pretty sure
I can And its the off season so there really aint no danger In a
month hed be doin fustrate

Who is he Where did he come from asked the superintendent

Names Brown He come fromfrom off here a ways was the strictly
truthful answer He used to be on a steamboat

All right If youll take a share of the responsibility Ill take the
rest And as soon as I can Ill send you a regular man

I cant pay you no steady wages Seth explained to his new helper
Salaries come from the govment and until they say so I aint got
no right to do it And I cant let you monkey with the lights except
to clean up around and such If you want to stay a spell until an
assistants appinted Ill undertake to be responsible for your keep
And if you need some new shoes or stockins or a cap or the like of
that Ill see you get em Furthern that I cant go yet Its a pretty
poor job for a fellow like you and if I was you I wouldnt take it

Oh yes you would replied Brown with conviction If you were I
you would take it with bells on Others may yearn for the strenuous
life but not your humble servant As for me I stay here and clean up
around

And stay he did performing the cleaning up and other duties with
unexpected success and zeal Atkins for the first day or two watched
him intently being still a trifle suspicious and fearful of his
substitute assistant But as time passed and the latter asked no more
questions seemed not in the least curious concerning his superior and
remained the same cool easygoing cheerful individual whom Seth had
found asleep on the beach the lightkeepers suspicions were ended It
was true that Brown was as mysterious and secretive as ever concerning
his own past but that had been a part of their bargain Atkins who
prided himself on being a judge of human nature decided that his helper
was a young gentleman in trouble but that the trouble whatever
it might be involved nothing criminal or dishonest That he was a
gentleman he was surehis bearing and manner proved that but he was
a gentleman who did not put on airs Not that there was any reason why
he should put on airs but so far as that was concerned there was no
apparent reason for the monumental conceit and condescension of some
of the inflated city boarders in the village Brown was not like those
people at all

Seth had taken a fancy to him at their first meeting Now his liking
steadily increased Companionship in a lonely spot like Eastboro
TwinLights is a test of a mans temper Brown stood the test well If
he made mistakes in the workand he did make some ridiculous oneshe
cheerfully undid them when they were pointed out to him He was for the
most part goodnatured and willing to talk though there were periods
when he seemed depressed and wandered off by himself along the beach or
sat by the edge of the bluff staring out to sea The lightkeeper made
no comment on this trait in his character It helped to confirm his own
judgment concerning the young fellows trouble People in trouble were
subject to fits of the blues and during these fits they liked to be
alone Seth knew this from his own experience There were times when he
too sought solitude

He trusted his helper more and more He did not of course permit
him to take the night watch in the lights but he did trust him to the
extent of leaving him alone for a whole afternoon while he drove the old
horse attached to the antique open wagonboth steed and vehicle a
part of the government propertyover to Eastboro to purchase tobacco
and newspapers at the store On his return he found everything as it
should be and this test led him to make others each of which was
successful in proving John Brown faithful over a few things and
therefore in time to be intrusted with many and more important ones

Brown on his part liked Seth He had professed to like him during the
conversation at the breakfast table which resulted in his remaining at
the lights but then he was not entirely serious He was of course
grateful for the kindness shown him by the odd longshoreman and enjoyed
the latters society and droll remarks as he would have enjoyed anything
out of the ordinary and quaintly amusing But now he really liked
the man Seth Atkins was a countryman and a marked contrast to any
individual Brown had ever met but he was far from being a fool He
possessed a fund of dry common sense and his comments on people and
happenings in the worlda knowledge of which he derived from the
newspapers and magazines obtained on his trips to Eastborowere a
constant delight And more than all he respected his companions
desire to remain a mystery Brown decided that Atkins was as he had
jokingly called him a man with a past What that past might be he did
not know or try to learn Mind your own business Seth had declared to
be the motto of Eastboro TwinLights and that motto suited both parties
to the agreement

The lightkeeper stood watch in the tower at night During most of the
day he slept but after the first week was over and his trust in his
helper became more firm he developed the habit of rising at two in the
afternoon eating a breakfastor dinner or whatever the meal might be
calledand wandering off along the crooked road leading south and in
the direction of Pounddug Slough The road little used and grass grown
twisted and turned amid the dunes until it disappeared in a distant
grove of scrub oaks and pitch pines Each afternoonexcept on Sundays
and on the occasions of his excursions to the villageAtkins would rise
from the table saunter to the door to look at the weather and then
without excuse or explanation start slowly down the road For the first
hundred yards he sauntered then the saunter became a brisk walk and
when he reached the edge of the grove he was hurrying almost at a dog
trot Sometimes he carried a burden with him a brown paper parcel
brought from Eastboro a hammer a saw or a coil of rope Once he
descended to the boathouse at the foot of the bluff by the inlet and
emerged bearing a big bundle of canvas apparently an old sail this
he arranged with some difficulty on his shoulder and stumbled up the
slope past the corner of the house and away toward the grove Brown
watched him wonderingly Where was he going and why What was the
mysterious destination of all these tools and old junk Where did
Seth spend his afternoons and why when he returned did his hands and
clothes smell of tar The substitute assistant was puzzled but he asked
no questions And Seth volunteered no solution of the puzzle

Yet the solution came and in an unexpected way Seth drove to the
village one afternoon and returned with literature smoking materials
and an announcement The latter he made during supper

I tried to buy that fly paper we wanted today he observed as a
preliminary Couldnt get none All out

But will have some in very shortly I presume suggested the
assistant who knew the idiosyncrasies of country stores

Oh yes sartin Expectin it every minute That stores got a
considerble sight more expectations in it than it has anything else
Theyre always six months ahead of the season or behind it in that
store When its so cold that the snow birds get chilblains theyll have
the shelves chuck full of fly paper Now when its hotter than a kittle
of pepper tea the bulk of their stock is ice picks and mittens Bah
However theyre goin to send the fly paper over when it comes along
with the dog

The dog repeated Brown in amazement

Yup Thats what I was goin to tell youabout the dog I ordered a
dog today Didnt pay nothin for him you understand Henry G the
storekeeper gave him to me The boyll fetch him down when he fetches
the fly paper

A dog Wereyoure going to keep a doghere

Sure thing Why not Got room enough to keep a whole zoological
menagerie if we wanted to aint we Besides a dogll be handy to have
around Bill Foster the life saver told me that somebody busted into
the station henhouse one night a week ago and got away with four of
their likeliest pullets He callates twas tramps or boys We dont
keep hens but theres some stuff in that boathouse I wouldnt want
stole and bein as theres no lock on the door a dog would be a sort
of protection as you might say

But thieves would never come way down here

Why not Taint any further away from the rest of creation than the
life savin station is it Anyhow Henry G give the dog to me free for
nothin and thats a miracle of itself Youd say so too if you
knew Henry I was so surprised that I said Id take it right off felt
twould be flyin in the face of Providence not to A miraclejumpin
Judas I never knew Henry to give anybody anything aforeunless twas
the smallpox and then twant a genuine case nothin but varioloid

But what kind of a dog is it

I dont know Henry used to own the mother of it and she was one
quarter mastiff and the rest assorted varieties This one hes givin
me aint a whole dog you see just a halfgrown pup The varioloid
all over againhey Ho ho I didnt really take him for sartin you
understand just on trial If we like him well keep him thats all

The third afternoon following this announcement Brown was alone in
the kitchen and busy Seth had departed on one of his mysterious
excursions carrying a coil of rope a pulley and a gallon can of paint
Before leaving the house he had given his helper some instructions
concerning supper

Mights well have a lobster tonight he said Ever cook a lobster
did you

No Mr Brown had never cooked a lobster

Well its simple enough All youve got to do is bile him Bile him in
hot water till hes done

I see The substitute assistant was not enthusiastic Cooking he did
not love

Humph he grunted I imagined if he was boiled at all it was be in
hot water not cold

Atkins chuckled I mean you want to have the water bilin hot when you
put him in he explained Wait till she biles up good and then souse
him see

I guess so How do you know when hes done

OherI cant tell you Youll have to trust to your instinct I
callate When he looks done he IS done most genrally speakin

Dear me how clear you make it Would you mind hintin as to how he
looks when hes done

Whywhy DONE of course

Yes of course How stupid of me He is done when he looks done and
when he looks done he is done Any child could follow those directions
HOW is he donebrown

No Brown the idea Red of course Hes green when you put him in
the kittle and when you take him out hes red Thats one way you can
tell

Yes that will help some All right Ill boil him till hes red you
neednt worry about that

Oh I shant worry So long Ill be back about six or so Put him in
when the waters good and hot and youll come out all right

Thank you I hope HE will but I have my doubts Where is he

Who the lobster Theres dozens down in the car by the wharf Lift the
cover and fish one out with the dip net Pick out the biggest one you
can find cause Im likely to be hungry when I get back and your
appetite aint a hummin birds There Ive got to go if I want to get
anything done afore    Humph never mind So long

He hurried away as if conscious that he had said more than he intended
At the corner of the house he turned to call

I say Brown be kind of careful when you dip him out None of em are
plugged

What

I say none of them lobsters claws are plugged I didnt have time to
plug the last lot I got from my pots so you want to handle em careful
like else theyll nip you Tote the one you pick out up to the house in
the dipnet then youll be all right

Evidently considering this warning sufficient to prevent any possible
trouble he departed John Brown seated himself in the armchair by the
door and gazed at the sea He gazed and thought until he could bear to
think no longer then he rose and entered the kitchen where he kindled
a fire in the range and filled a kettle with water Having thus made
ready the sacrificial altar he took the longhandled dipnet from its
nail and descended the bluff to the wharf

The lobster car a goodsized affair of laths with a hinged cover
closing the opening in its upper surface was floating under the wharf
to which it was attached by a rope Brown knelt on the stringpiece
and peered down at it It floated deep in the water the tide rippling
strongly through it between the laths The cover was fastened with a
wooden button

The substitute assistant after a deal of futile and exasperating poking
with the handle of the net managed to turn the button and throw back
the leatherhinged cover Through the square opening the water beneath
looked darkly green There was much seaweed in the car and occasionally
this weed was stirred by living things which moved sluggishly

John Brown reversed the net and lying flat on the wharf gingerly
thrust the business end of the contrivance through the opening and into
the dark weedstreaked water Then he began feeling for his prey

He could feel it Apparently the car was alive with lobsters As he
moved the net through the water there was always one just before it or
behind it but at least ten minutes elapsed before he managed to get
one in it At length when his arms were weary and his patience almost
exhausted the submerged net became heavy and the handle shook in his
grasp He shortened his hold and began to pull in hand over hand He had
a lobster a big lobster

He could see a pair of claws opening and shutting wickedly He raised
the creature through the opening balanced the net on its edge rose on
one knee tried to stand erect stumbled lost his hold on the handle
and shot the lobster neatly out of the meshes over the edge of the car
and into the free waters of the channel Then he expressed his feelings
aloud and with emphasis

Five minutes later he got another but it was too small to be of use In
twenty minutes he netted three more two of which got away The third
however he dragged pantingly to the wharf and sat beside it gloating
It was his for keeps and it was a big one the greatgrandaddy of
lobsters Its claws clashed and snapped at the twine of the net like a
pair of giant nut crackers

Carrying it as far from his body as its weight at the end of the handle
would permit he bore it in triumph to the kitchen To boil a lobster
alive had seemed a mean trick and cruel when Seth Atkins first ordered
him to do it Now he didnt mind it would serve the thing right for
being so hard to catch Entering the kitchen he balanced the net across
a chair and stepped to the range to see if the water was boiling It was
not and for a very good reasonthe fire had gone out Again Mr Brown
expressed his feelings

The fire newly kindled had burned to the last ash If he had been
there to add more coal in season it would have survived but he had
been otherwise engaged There was nothing to be done except rake out the
ashes and begin anew This he did When he removed the kettle he decided
at once that it was much too small for the purpose required of it To
boil a lobster of that size in a kettle of that size would necessitate
boiling one end at a time and that both for the victim and himself
would be troublesome and agonizing He hunted about for a larger kettle
and finding none seized in desperation upon the wash boiler filled
it and lifted it to the top of the stove above the flickering new fire

The fire burned slowly and he sat down to rest and wait As he sank
into the chairnot that across which the netted lobster was balanced
but anotherhe became aware of curious sounds from without Distant
sounds they were far off and faint but growing steadily louder wails
and longdrawn howls mournful and despairing

Aaooow Aaowooo

What in the world muttered Brown and ran out of the kitchen and
around the corner of the house

There was nothing in sight nothing strange or unusual that is Joshua
Seths old horse picketted to a post in the back yard and grazing or
trying to graze on the stubby beach grass was the only living exhibit
But the sounds continued and grew louder

Aaowooo Owooowooo

Over the rise of a dune a hundred yards off where the road to Eastboro
village dipped towards a swampy hollow appeared a horses head and
the top of a covered wagon A moment later the driver became visible
a freckled faced boy grinning like a pumpkin lantern The horse trotted
through the sand up to the lights Joshua whinnied as if he enjoyed the
prospect of company From the back of the wagon somewhere beneath the
shade of the cover arose a heartrending wail reeking of sorrow and
agony

AaowOOO OooaaOW

For heavens sake exclaimed the lightkeepers helper running to meet
the vehicle what is the matter

The boy grinned more expansively than ever Whoa he shouted to the
horse he was driving The animal stopped in his tracks evidently glad
of the opportunity Another howl burst from the covered depths of the
wagon

Ive got him said the boy with a triumphant nod and a jerk of his
thumb over his shoulder Hes in there

He Who What

Job Hes in there Hear him Hes been goin on like that ever since
he finished his bone and that was over two mile back Say admiringly
hes some singer aint he Hear that will ye

Another wail arose from the wagon Brown hastened to the rear of the
vehicle on the canvas side of which were painted the words Henry G
Goodspeed Groceries Dry and Fancy Goods and Notions Eastboro and
peered in over the tailboard The interior of the wagon was well nigh
filled by a big box with strips of board nailed across its top From
between these strips a tawny nose was uplifted As the helper stared
wonderingly at the box and the nose the boy sprang from his seat and
joined him

Thats him declared the boy Hi there Job tune up now Whats the
matter with ye

His answer was an unearthly howl from the box accompanied by a mighty
scratching The boy laughed delightedly

Aint he a wonder he demanded Ought to be in church choir hadnt
he

Brown stepped on the hub of a rear wheel and clinging to the post of
the wagon cover looked down into the box The creature inside was about
the size of a month old calf

Its aits a dog he exclaimed A dog isnt it

Sure its a dog Or hell be a dog when he grows up Nothin but a pup
now he aint Wheres Seth

Seth Oh Mr Atkins hes not here

Aint he Wheres he gone

I dont know

Dont ye Whens he comin back HUSH UP This last was a command to
the prisoner in the box who paid absolutely no attention to it

I dont know when hell be back Do you want to see him personally
Wont I do Im in charge here till he returns

Be ye Oh youre the new assistant from Boston Youll do All I want
to do is unload himJob I meanand leave a couple bundles of fly
paper Seth ordered Here lowering the tailboard and climbing into the
wagon you catch aholt of tother end of the box and Ill shove on this
one Hush up Job Nobodys goin to eat yeless its the moskeeters
Now then mister here he comes

He began pushing the box toward the open end of the wagon The dogs
whines and screams and scratchings furnished an accompaniment almost
deafening

Wait Stop For heavens sake wait shouted Brown What are you
putting that brute off here for I dont want him

Yes you do Seth does anyhow Henry G made him a present of Job last
time Seth was over to the store Didnt he tell ye

Then the substitute assistant remembered This was the halfgrown pup
Atkins had said was to be brought over by the grocery boy This was the
creature they were to accept on trial

Well by George he exclaimed in disgust

Didnt Seth tell ye asked the boy again

Yes    Yes I believe he did But

Then stand by while I unload him Here he comes now Hist him down
easy as you can

That was not too easy for the end of the box slid from the tailboard
to the ground with a thump that shook the breath from the prisoner
within But the breath came back again and furnished motive power for
more and worse howls and whines Joshua pricked up his ears and trotted
to the further end of his halter

There said Henry Gs boy jumping to the ground beside the box
thats off my hands thank the mercy Heres your fly paper Five dozen
sheets You must have pretty nigh as many flies down here as you have
moskeeters Well so long I got to be goin

Wait a minute pleaded Brown What shall I do with thiserblessed
dog Is he savage Why did you bring him in a cratelike a piano

Cause twas the easiest way You couldnt tie him up not in a cart no
biggern this Mights well tie up an elephant Besides he wont stay
tied up nowheres Busted more clotheslines than Ive got fingers and
toes that pup has He needs a chain cable to keep him to his moorins
Dont ye Job you old earthquake Hey

He pounded on the box and the earthquake obliged with a renewed series
of shocks and shakings

The lightkeepers assistant smiled in spite of himself

Who named him Job he asked

Henry Gs cousin from Boston He said he seemed to be always sufferin
and fillin the land with roarins like Job in the Bible So bein as
he hadnt no name except cuss words that one stuck I callate Henry
Gs glad enough to get rid of him Ho ho

Did Mr Atkins see histhisdid he see his present before he accepted
it

No Thats the best part of the joke Well clambering to his seat
and picking up the reins Ive got five mile of sand and moskeeters to
navigate so Ive got to be joggin Oh say goin to leave him in the
box there be ye

I guess so for the present

Well I wouldnt leave him too long Hes strongern Samson and the
Philippines rolled together and hes humped up his back so much on the
way acrost that hes started most of the nails in them slats over top of
him I tell ye what you do Give him a bone or a chunk of tough meat to
chaw on Then hell rest easy for a spell Goodbye I wish I could
stay and see Seth when he looks at his present but I cant Giddap
January

The grocery wagon rolled out of the yard The forsaken Job sent a
roar of regret after him Also he humped us his back and the nails
holding the slats in place started and gave alarmingly John Brown
hastened to the house in quest of a bone




CHAPTER V

THE GOING OF JOSHUA


He found one after a time the relic of a ham with a good deal of meat
on it Atkins economical soul would have protested in horror against
the sinful waste but his helper would cheerfully have sacrificed a
whole hog to quiet the wails from the box in the yard He pushed the
ham bone between the slats and Job received it greedily The howls
and whines ceased and were succeeded by gnawings and crunchings Brown
returned to the kitchen to inspect his neglected fire

This time the fire was not out but it burned slowly The water in the
wash boiler was only lukewarm The big lobster in the net balanced
on the chair clashed his claws wickedly as the substitute assistant
approached The door had been left open and the room hummed with flies
Brown shut the door and while waiting for the water to heat separated
a dozen sheets of the sticky fly paper and placed them in conspicuous
places He wondered as he did so what some of his former acquaintances
would say if they could see him HeHEa cook and a roustabout a
dishwasher and a scrubber of brass at Eastboro TwinLights How long
must he stay there For months at least He should be thankful that he
was there thankful that there was such a place where no one came and
where he could remain until he was forgotten He was thankful of course
he was But what a life to live

He wondered what Atkins thought of him how much the lightkeeper guessed
concerning his identity and his story He could not guess within miles
of the truth but he must indulge in some curious speculations Then he
fell to wondering about Seth himself What was it that the lightkeeper
was hiding from the world Odd that two people each possessing a
secret should come together at that lonely spot Where was it that Seth
went almost every afternoon Had these daily absences any connection
with the great mystery

He distributed the sheets of fly paper about the room in places where
he judged them likely to do the most good and had the satisfaction of
seeing a number of the tormenting insects caught immediately Then
he tested the water in the boiler It was warmer even hot but not
boiling

He had almost forgotten the dog but now was reminded by the animal
itself who having apparently swallowed the bone whole began once more
to howl lugubriously Brown decided to let him howl for the present
and going into the livingroom picked up an old magazine and began
listlessly to read

The howls from the yard continued swelled to a crescendo of shrieks
and then suddenly ceased A moment later there was a thump and a mighty
scratching at the kitchen door The substitute assistant dropped the
magazine and sprang from his chair

Good Lord he exclaimed I believe

He did not finish the sentence There was no need If he had any doubts
as to the cause of the racket at the door they were dispelled by a howl
like a fog whistle Job had escaped from durance vile and was seeking
companionship

Brown muttered an exclamation of impatience and opening the door a very
little way peeped through the crack The puphe looked like a scrawny
young lionhailed his appearance with a series of wild yelps His
mouth opened like a Mammoth Cave in miniature and a foot of red tongue
flapped like a danger signal

Get out you brute ordered Brown

Job did not get out Instead he yelped again and capered with the grace
of a cow His feet and legs seemed to have grown out of proportion to
the rest of him they were enormous Down the length of his yellow back
were three raw furrows which the nails of the box cover had scraped as
he climbed from under them

Nice dog coaxed the lightkeepers helper Nice doggie Good old
boy

The good old boy pranced joyfully and made a charge at the door Brown
slammed it shut just in time

Clear out he yelled from behind it Go away Go and lie down

The answer was a mighty howl of disappointment and an assault on the
door which threatened to shatter the panels Jobs paws were armed with
claws proportionate to their size

This would never do The paint on that door had been furnished by the
government and Atkins was very careful of it Brown within pounded
a protest and again commanded the dog to go and lie down Job without
thumped and scratched and howled louder than ever He had decidedly the
best of the duet and the door was suffering every second Brown picked
up the fire shovel and threw the door wide open

Get out he roared Get out or Ill kill you

He brandished the shovel expecting an assault But none came It was
evident that Job knew a shovel when he saw it had encountered other
shovels in the course of his brief young life His ears and tail
drooped and he backed away

Clear out repeated Brown advancing threateningly With each step of
the advance Job retreated a corresponding distance When the assistant
stopped he stopped Brown lowered the shovel and looked at him The dog
grovelled in the sand and whined dolefully

Humph grunted the young man I guess youre not as dangerous as you
look Stay where you are and keep still

He turned to enter the kitchen turning again just in time to find the
pup at his heels He lifted the shovel and Job jumped frantically out
of reach sat down in a clump of beach grass lifted his nose to the sky
and expressed his feelings in a howl of utter misery

Goodheavens observed John Brown fervently and shifting the shovel
to his left hand rubbed his forehead with his right Job howled once
more and gazed at him with sorrowful appeal The situation was so
ridiculous that the young man began to laugh This merriment appeared to
encourage the pup who stopped howling and began to caper throwing the
loose sand from beneath his paws in showers

Whats the matter old boy inquired Brown Lonesome are you

Job was making himself the center of a smallsized sand spout

Humph Well    well all right Im not going to hurt you Stay
where you are and I wont shut the door

But this compromise was not satisfactory because the moment the young
man started to cross the threshold the dog started to follow When Brown
halted he followed suitand howled Then the substitute assistant
surrendered unconditionally

All right he said Come in then if you want to Come in but for
goodness sake keep still when you are in

He strode into the kitchen leaving the door open Job slunk after him
and crouched with his muzzle across the sill evidently not yet certain
that his victory was complete He did not howl however and his late
adversary was thankful for the omission

Brown bethought himself of the water in the wash boiler and removing
the cover tested it with his finger It was steadily heating but not
yet at the boiling point He pushed the boiler aside lifted a lid of
the range and inspected the fire From behind him came a yelp another
a thump and then a series of thumps and yelps He turned and saw Job in
the center of the floor apparently having a fit

The moment his back was turned the pup had sneaked into the kitchen
It was not a large kitchen and Job was distinctly a large dog Also
he was suspicious of further assaults with the fire shovel and had
endeavored to find a hiding place under the table In crawling beneath
this article of furniture he had knocked off a sheet of the fly paper
This had fallen butter side down upon his back and stuck fast He
reached aft to pull it loose with his teeth and had encountered a
second sheet laid on a chair This had stuck to his neck Job was an
apprehensive animal by nature and as the result of experience and his
nerves were easily unstrung He forgot the shovel forgot the human whom
he had been fearfully trying to propitiate forgot everything except the
dreadful objects which clung to him and pulled his hair He rolled from
beneath the table a shrieking kicking snapping cyclone And that
kitchen was no place for a cyclone

He rolled and whirled for an instant then scrambled to his feet and
began running in widening circles Brown tried to seize him as he
passed but he might as well have seized a railroad train Another
chair also loaded with fly paper upset and Job added a third sheet to
his collection This one plastered itself across his nose and eyes He
ceased running forward and began to leap high in the air and backwards
The net containing the big lobster fell to the floor Then John Brown
fled to the open air leaned against the side of the building and
screamed with laughter

Inside the kitchen the uproar was terrific Howls shrill yelps thumps
and crashes Then came a crash louder than any preceding it a splash of
water across the sill and from the doorway leaped or flew an object
steaming and dripping fluttering with fly paper and with a giant
lobster clamped firmly to its tail The lobster was knocked off against
the door post but the rest of the exhibit kept on around the corner of
the house shrieking as it flew Brown collapsed in the sand and laughed
until his sides ached and he was too weak to laugh longer

At last he got up and staggered after it He was still laughing when
he reached the back yard but there he stopped laughing and uttered an
exclamation of impatience and some alarm

Of Job there was no sign though from somewhere amid the dunes sounded
yelps screams and the breaking of twigs as the persecuted one fled
blindly through the bayberry and beachplum bushes But Brown was not
anxious about the dog What caused him to shout and then break into a
run was the sight of Joshua the old horse galloping at top speed along
the road to the south Even his sedate and ancient calm had not been
proof against the apparition which burst from the kitchen In his fright
he had broken his halter rope and manageda miracle considering his
ageto leap the pasture fence and run

That horse was the apple of Seth Atkinss eye The lightkeeper believed
him to be a wonder of strength and endurance and never left the lights
without cautioning his helper to keep an eye on Joshua cause if
anything happened to him Id have to hunt a mighty long spell to find
another that could tech him Brown accepted this trust with composure
feeling morally certain that the only thing likely to happen to
Joshua was death from overeating or old age And now something had
happenedJoshua was running away

There was but one course to take Brown must leave the governments
property in its own care and capture that horse He had laughed until
running seemed an impossibility but run he must and did after a
fashion But Joshua was running too and he was frightened He galloped
like a colt and the assistant lightkeeper gained upon him very slowly

The road was crooked and hilly and the sand in its ruts was deep Brown
would not have gained at all but for the fact that the horse from long
habit kept to the roadway and never tried short cuts His pursuer did
and therefore just as Joshua entered the grove on the bluff above
Pounddug Slough Brown caught up with him and made a grab at the end of
the trailing halter He missed it and the horse took a fresh start

The road through the grove was overgrown with young trees and bushes
and amid these the animal had a distinct advantage Not until the outer
edge of the grove was reached did the panting assistant get another
opportunity at the rope This time he seized it and held on

Whoa he shouted Whoa

But Joshua did not whoa at once He kept on along the edge of the
high sandy slope Brown from the tail of his eye caught a glimpse
of the winding channel of the Slough beneath him of a small schooner
heeled over on the mud flat at its margin and of the figure of a man at
work beside it

Whoa he ordered once more Whoa Josh stand still

Perhaps the horse would have stood stillhe seemed about to do sobut
from the distance somewhere on the road he had just traversed came
a howl longdrawn and terrifyingly familiar Joshua heard it jumped
sidewise jerked at the halter and as if playing snap the whip
sent his wouldbe captor heels over head over the edge of the bank and
rolling down the sandy slope The halter flew from Browns hands he
rolled and bumped and clutched at clumps of grass and bushes Then he
struck the beach and stopped spreadeagled on the wet sand

A voice said WellbyTIME

Brown looked up Seth Atkins a paint pail in one hand and a dripping
brush in the other was standing beside him blank astonishment written
on his features

Wellby time said Seth again and with even stronger emphasis

The substitute assistant raised himself to his knees rubbed his back
with one hand and then turning sat in the sand and returned his
superiors astonished gaze with one of equal bewilderment

Hello he gasped Well by George its you isnt it What are you
doing here

The lightkeeper put down the pail of paint

What am I doin he repeated What am I doin Say His
astonishment changed to suspicion and wrath Never you mind what Im
doin he went on Thats my affairs What are YOU doin here Thats
what I want to know

Brown rubbed the sand out of his hair

I dont know exactly what I am doingyet he panted

You dont hey Well youd better find out Maybe I can help you to
remember Sneakin after me want you Spyin to find out what I was
up to hey

He shook the wet paint brush angrily at his helper Brown looked at him
for an instant then he rose to his feet

Spyin on me was you repeated Seth

Didnt I tell you that mindin your own business was part of our dicker
if you was goin to stay at Eastboro lighthouse Didnt I tell you
that

The young man answered with a contemptuous shrug Turning on his heel
he started to walk away Atkins sprang after him

Answer me he ordered Didnt I say youd got to mind your own
business

You did coldly

You bet I did And was you mindin it

No I was minding yourslike a fool Now you may mind it yourself

Hold on there Where you goin

Back to the lights And you may go to the devil or anywhere else that
suits your convenience and take your confounded menagerie with you

My menagWhat on earth Say hold on Mercy on us whats that

From the top of the bluff came a crashing and a series of yelps Through
the thicket of beachplum bushes was thrust a yellow head fringed with
torn fragments of fly paper

Whats that demanded the astonished lightkeeper

Brown looked at the whining apparition in the bushes and smiled
maliciously

That he observed is Job

JOB

Yes From somewhere in the grove came a thrashing of branches and a
frightened neigh And that he continued is Joshua I presume If
there are more Old Testament patriarchs in the vicinity I dont know
where they are and I dont care You may hunt for them yourself Im
going to follow your advice and mind my own business Good by

He strode off up the beach Job at the top of the bank started to
follow but a wellaimed pebble caused him to dodge back

Hold on roared the lightkeeper Maybe I made a mistake Perhaps you
want spyin on me Dont go off mad I    Wait

But John Brown did not wait He strode rapidly away up the beach Seth
stared after him From the grove where his halter had caught firmly in
the fork of a young pine Joshua thrashed and neighed

Aaooow howled Job from the bushes


An hour later Atkins leading the weary and homesick Joshua by the
bridle trudged in at the lighthouse yard Job still ornamented with
remnants of the fly paper slunk at his heels Seth stabled the horse
and after some manoeuvering managed to decoy the dog down the slope to
the boathouse where he closed the door upon him and his whines Then he
climbed back to the kitchen

The table was set for one and in the wash boiler on the range the giant
lobster was cooking Of the substitute assistant keeper there was no
sign but after searching Seth found him in his room

Well observed Atkins gruffly we might s well have supper hadnt
we

Brown did not seem interested Your supper is ready I think he
answered I tried not to forget anything

I guess tis seems to be Come on and well eat

I have eaten thank you

You have Alone

Yes That too with emphasis is a part of my business

The lightkeeper stared grunted and then went out of the room He ate a
lonely meal not of the lobsterhe kept that for another occasionbut
one made up of cold scraps from the pantry He wandered uneasily about
the premises quieted Jobs wails for the time by a gift of eatable odds
and ends tossed into the boathouse smoked tried to read and when it
grew dusk lit the lamps in the towers At last he walked to the closed
door of his helpers room and rapped

Well was the ungracious response

Its me Atkins he announced hesitatingly Id like to speak to
you if you dont mind

On business

Well nonot exactly Say Brown I guess likely Id ought to beg your
pardon again I callate Ive made another mistake I jedge you want
spyin on me when you dove down that bankin

Your judgment is good this time I was not

No Im sartin you want I apologize and take it all back Now can I
come in

The door was thrown open Seth entered looking sheepish and sat down
in the little caneseated rocker

Say he began after a moment of uncomfortable silence would you
mindnow that Ive begged your pardon and alltellin me what did
happen while I was away I imagine judgin by the looks of things in
the kitchen that there waserwell considerble doin as the boys
say

He grinned Brown tried to be serious but was obliged to smile in
return

Ill tell you he said Of course you know where thaterremarkable
dog came from

I can guess drily Henry Gs present aint he Humph Well Id
ought to have known that anything Henry would GIVE away was likely to
be remarkable in all sorts of ways All right thats one Henrys got on
me Tomorrow afternoon me and Job take a trip back to Eastboro and one
of us stays there It may be me but I have my doubts I agreed to take
a DOG on trial not a yellerjaundiced cow with a church organ inside of
it Hear the critter whoopin down there in the boathouse And hes eat
everything thats chewable on the reservation already Hes a famine on
legs that pup But never mind him Hes been triedand found guilty
Tell me what happened

Brown began the tale of the afternoons performances beginning with his
experience as a lobster catcher Seth smiled then chuckled and finally
burst into roars of laughter in which the narrator joined

Jiminy crimps exclaimed Seth when the story was finished Oh by
jiminy crimps that beats the Dutch and everybodys been told what the
Dutch beat Ha ha ho ho Brown I apologize all over again I dont
wonder you was put out when I accused you of spyin Wonder you hadnt
riz up off that sand and butchered me where I stood Callate thats
what Id have done in your place Well I hope theres no hard feelins
now

No Your apology is accepted

Thats good Erersay youyou must have been sort of surprised to
see me paintin the Daisy M

The which

The Daisy M Thats the name of that old schooner I was to work on

Indeed    How is the weather tonight clear

Yes its fair now but looks sort of thick to the eastard I say
you must have been surprised to see me paintin the Daisy M Ive been
tinkerin on that old boat off and on ever since last fall Bought her
for eight dollars of the feller that owned her and she was a hulk for
sartin then Ive caulked her up and rigged her after a fashion Now
she might float if she had a chance Every afternoon pretty nigh Ive
been at her Dont know exactly why I do it neither And yet I do
too Probly youve wondered where I was takin all that old canvas and
stuff I

Excuse me Atkins I mind my own business you know I ask no
questions and you are under no obligation to tell me anything

I know I know The lightkeeper nodded solemnly He clasped his knee
with his hands and rocked back and forth in his chair I know he went
on an absent wistful look in his eye but you must have wondered
just the same I bought that craft becausewell because she reminded
me of old times I callate I used to command a schooner like her once
bigger and lots more able of course but a fishin schooner same
as she used to be And I was a good skipper if I do say it My crews
jumped when I said the word now I tell you Thats where I belongon
the deck of a vessel Im a man therea man

He paused Brown made no comment Seth continued to rock and to talk he
seemed to be thinking aloud

Yes sir he declared with a sigh when I was afloat I was a man
and folks respected me I just do love salt water and sailin craft
Thats why I bought the Daisy M Ive been riggin her and caulkin her
just for the fun of doin it Shell never float again It would take
a tide like a flood to get her off them flats But when Im aboard or
putterin around her Im happyhappier I mean It makes me forget
Im a goodfornothin derelict stranded in an old womans job of
lightkeepin Ah humaday young feller you dont know what it is
to have been somebody and then because you was a fool and did a fool
thing to be nothinnothin You dont know what that is

John Brown caught his breath His fist descended upon the window ledge
beside him

Dont I he groaned By George dont I Do you suppose

He stopped short Atkins started and came out of his dream

Whywhy yes he said hastily I spose likely you do    Well
good night Ive got to go on watch See you in the mornin




CHAPTER VI

THE PICNIC


Seth was true to his promise concerning Job The next afternoon that
remarkable canine was decoyed by the usual bone into the box in which
he had arrived Being in the cover was securely renailed above him
Brown and the lightkeeper lifted the box into the back part of the
open wagon and Atkins drove triumphantly away the pups agonized
protests against the journey serving as spurs to urge Joshua faster
along the road to the village When about six oclock Seth reentered
the yard he was grinning broadly

Well inquired Brown did he take him back willingly

Who Henry G I dont know about the willin part but hell take him
back I attended to that

What did he say Did he think you ungrateful for refusing to accept his
present

Atkins laughed aloud He didnt say nothin he declared He didnt
know it when I left Eastboro I want such a fool as to cart that
critter to the store where all the gang round the store could holler
and make fun Not much I drove way round the other way up the back
road and unloaded him at Henrys house I callated to leave him with
Aunt Olivethats Henrys sister keepin house for himbut shed gone
out to sewin circle and there want nobody to home The side door was
unlocked so I lugged that box into the settin room and left it there
Pretty nigh broke my back and that everlastin Job hollered so I
thought the whole town would hear him and come runnin to stop the
murderin that theyd callate was bein done But there aint no nigh
neighbors and those that are nighest aint on speakin terms with
Henry ruther have him murdered than not I shouldnt wonder So I left
Job in his box in the settin room and cleared out

The substitute assistant smiled delightedly

Good enough he exclaimed What a pleasant surprise for friend Henry
or his housekeeper

Ho ho aint it I rather guess twill be Henry himself thats
surprised fust Aunt Olive never leaves sewin circle till the last bit
of suppers eat upshes got some of her brothers stinginess in her
makeupso I callate Henryll get home afore she does I shouldnt
wonder with an exuberant chuckle if that settin room was some
stirred up when he sees it The pup had loosened the box cover afore I
left Ho ho

But wont he send the dog back here again

No he wont I left a note for him on the table There was
considerble ginger in every line of it No Job wont be sent here
no matter what becomes of him And if anything SHOULD be broke in that
settin roomwell there was SOME damage done to our kitchen No I
guess Henry G and me are square He wont make any fuss he wants to
keep our trade you see

It was a true prophecy The storekeeper made no trouble and Job
remained at Eastboro until a foray on a neighbors chickens resulted
in his removal from this vale of tears Neither the lightkeeper nor
his helper ever saw him again and when Seth next visited the store
and solicitously inquired concerning the pups health Henry G merely
looked foolish and changed the subject

But the dogs short sojourn at the TwinLights had served to solve one
mystery that of Atkinss daily excursions to Pounddug Slough He
went there to work on the old schooner the Daisy M Seth made no more
disclosures concerning his past lifethat remained a secretbut he did
suggest his helpers going to inspect the schooner Just walk across
and look her over he said Id like to know what you think of her
See if I aint makin a pretty good job out of nothin FOR nothin of
course he added gloomily but it keeps me from thinkin too much Go
and see her thats a good feller

So the young man did go He climbed aboard the stranded crafta forlorn
picture she made lying on her side in the mudand was surprised to
find how much had been manufactured out of nothing Her seams those
which the sun had opened were caulked neatly her deck was clean and
white she was partially rigged with new and old canvas and ropes and
to his landsmans eyes she looked almost fit for sea But when he said
as much to Seth the latter laughed scornfully

Fit for nothin scoffed the lightkeeper I could make her fit
maybe if I wanted to spend money enough but I dont I cant get at
her starboard side thats down in the mud and I callate shed leak
like a skimmer Shes only got a foresl and a jib and the jibs only
a little one that used to belong to a thirtyfoot sloop Her anchors
gone and I wouldnt trust her main topmast to carry anything biggern a
handkerchief nor that in a breeze no more powerful than a canary birds
breath And as I told you it would take a tide like a flood to float
her No shes no good and never will be but with a sigh I get a
little fun fussin over her

Erby the way he added a little later of course you wont mention
to nobody what I told you aboutabout my bein a fishin skipper
once Not that anybody ever comes here for you to mention it to but I
wouldnt want    You see nobody in Eastboro or anywheres on the Cape
knows where I come from and so    Oh all right all right I know
you aint the kind to talk Mind our own business thats the motto you
and me cruise under hey

Yet although the conversation in the substitute assistants room was
not again referred to by either it had the effect of making the oddly
assorted pair a bit closer in their companionship The mutual trust
was strengthened by the lightkeepers half confidence and Browns
sympathetic reception of it Each was lonely each had moments when
he felt he must express his hidden feelings to some one and though
neither recognized the fact it was certain that the time was coming
when all mysteries would be mysteries no longer And one day occurred a
series of ridiculous happenings which bidding fair at first to end in
a quarrel the relationship between the two instead revealed in both a
kindred trait that removed the last barrier

At a little before ten on this particular morning Brown busy in
the kitchen heard vigorous language outside It was Atkins who was
speaking and the assistant wondered who on earth he could be talking
to A glance around the doorpost showed that he was apparently talking
to himselfat least there was no other human being to be seen He held
in his hand a battered pair of marine glasses and occasionally he peered
through them Each time he did so his soliloquy became more animated and
profane

Whats the matter demanded Brown emerging from the house

Matter repeated Seth Matter enough Here take a squint through
them glasses and tell me whos in that buggy comin yonder

The buggy a black dot far down the sandy road leading from the village
was rocking and dipping over the dunes The assistant took the glasses
adjusted them and looked as directed

Why he said slowly there are three people in that buggy A
manand

And two women thats what I thought Dum idiots comin over to picnic
and spend the day sures taxes And theyll want to be showed round the
lights and everywheres and theyll ask moren forty million questions
Consarn the luck

Brown looked troubled He had no desire to meet strangers

How do you know theyre coming here he asked The answer was
conclusive

Because snarled Seth as I should think youd know by this time
there aint no other place round here they COULD come to

A moment later he added Well youll have to show em round

I will

Sartin Thats part of the assistant keepers job

He chuckled as he said it That chuckle grated on the young mans
nerves

Im not the assistant he declared cheerfully

You aint What are you then

Oh just a helper I dont get any wages Youve told me yourself over
and over that I have no regular standing here And according to
the government rules those youve got posted in the kitchen the
lightkeeper is obliged to show visitors about I wouldnt break the
rules for the world Good morning Think Ill go down to the beach

He stalked away whistling Atkins his face flaming roared after him a
profane opinion concerning his actions Then he went into the kitchen
slamming the door with a bang

Some twenty minutes later the helper heard his name shouted from the top
of the bluff

Mr Brown I say Ahoy there Mr Brown Come up here a minute wont
ye

Brown clambered up the path A little man with grey throat whiskers
and wearing an antiquated straw hat the edge of the brim trimmed with
black braid was standing waiting for him

Sorry to trouble you Mr Brown stammered the little man but you be
Mr Brown aint you

I am Yes

Well I callated you was My names Stover Abijah Stover I live over
to Trumet Me and my wife drove over for a sort of picnic like Weve
got her cousin Mrs Sophia Hains along Sophis a widow from Boston
and she aint never seen a lighthouse afore I know Seth Atkins
slightly and I was callatin hed show us around but bein as hes so
sick

Sick Is Mr Atkins sick

Why yes Didnt you know it Hes in the bedroom there groanin
somethin terrible He told me not to say nothin to the women folks
but to hail you and youd look out for us Didnt you know he was laid
up Why he

Brown did not wait to hear more He strode to the house with Mr Stover
at his heels On his way he caught a glimpse of the buggy the horse
dozing between the shafts On the seat of the buggy were two women one
plump and roundfaced the other thin and gaunt

Mr Stover panted behind him

Say Mr Brown he whispered as they entered the kitchen dont tell
my wife nor Sophi about Seths bein sick Better not say a word to them
about it

The tone in which this was spoken made the substitute assistant curious

Why not he asked

Causewell cause Hannahs hobby is sick folks as you might say If
theres a cat in the neighborhood thats ailin shes always dosin of
it up and fixin medicine for it and the like of that And Sophis one
of them New Thoughters and dont believe anybodys got any right to be
sick The two of em aint done nothin but argue and row over diseases
and imagination and medicines ever since Sophi got here If they knew
Seth was laid up I honestly believe theyd drop picnic and everythin
and start fightin over whether he was really sick or just thought he
was And I sort of figgered on havin a quiet day off

Brown found the lightkeeper stretched on the bed in his room He was
dressed with the exception of coat and boots and when the young man
entered he groaned feebly

Whats the matter demanded the alarmed helper

Oh my groaned Seth Oh my

Are you in pain What is it Shall I phone for the doctor

No no No use gettin the doctor Ill be all right by and by Its
one of my attacks I have em every once in a while Just let me alone
and let me lay here without bein disturbed then Ill get better I
guess

But its so sudden

I know They always come on that way Now run along like a good
feller and leave me to my suffrins Ooh dear

Much troubled Brown turned to the door As he was going out he happened
to look back The dresser stood against the wall beyond the bed and
in its mirror he caught a glimpse of the face of the sick man On that
face which should have been distorted with agony was a broad grin

Brown found the little Stover man waiting for him in the kitchen

Be you ready he asked

Ready repeated Brown absently Ready for what

Why to show us round the lights Sophi she aint never seen one
afore Atkins said that bein as he wasnt able to leave his bed youd
show us around

He did hey

Yes He said youd be glad to

Hum Mr Browns tone was that of one upon whom out of darkness a
light has suddenly burst I see he mused thoughtfully Yes yes I
see

For a minute he stood still evidently pondering Then with a twinkle
in his eye he strode out of the house and walked briskly across to the
buggy

Good morning ladies he said removing the new cap which Seth had
recently purchased for him in Eastboro Mr Stover tells me you wish to
be shown the lights

The plump woman answered Yes she said briskly we do Are you a
new keeper Wheres Mr Atkins

Mr Atkins I regret to say began Brown is ill He

Stover standing at his elbow interrupted nervously

Mr Brown herell show us around he said quickly Seth said he
would

I shall be happy concurred that young gentleman You must excuse me
if I seem rather worried Mr Atkins my chiefI believe you know him
Mrs Stoverhas been taken suddenly ill and is apparently suffering
much pain The attack was very sudden and I

Sick The plump woman seemed actually to prick up her ears like a
sleepy cat at the sound of the dinner bell Is Seth sick And you all
alone with him here Cant I do anything to help

All he wants is to be left alone put in her husband anxiously He
said so himself

Do you know whats the matter Have you got any medicine for him Mrs
Stover was already climbing out of the buggy

No replied Brown I havent That is I havent given him any yet

The slim woman Mrs Hains of Boston now broke into the conversation

Good thing she snapped Most medicines nothing but opium and
alcohol Fill the poor creature full of drugs and

I spose youd set and preach New Thought at him snapped Mrs Stover
As if a body could be cured by hot air I believe Ill go right in and
see him Dont you spose I could help Mr Brown

Mr Brown seemed pleased but reluctant Its awfully good of you he
said I couldnt think of troubling you when youve come so far on a
pleasure excursion But I am at my wit s end

Dont say another word Mrs Stovers bulky figure was already on the
way to the door of the house Im only too glad to do what I can And
if I do say it that shouldnt Im always real handy in a sick room
Bijah be quiet I dont care if we ARE on a picnic no human bein
shall suffer while I set around and do nothin

Mrs Hains was at her cousins heels

Youll worry him to death she declared Youll tell him how sick
he is and that hes goin to die and such stuff What he needs is
cheerful conversation and mental uplift Its too bad Well you shant
have your own way with him anyhow Mr Brown where is he

You two goin to march right into his BEDROOM screamed the irate
Abijah The women answered not They were already in the kitchen Brown
hastened after them

Its all right ladies he said Right this way please

He led the way to the chamber of the sick man Mr Atkins turned on his
bed of pain caught a glimpse of the visitors and sat up

What in time he roared

Seth said Brown benignly this is Mrs Stover of Eastboro I think
you know her And Mrs Hains of Boston These ladies have heard of your
sickness and having had experience in such cases have kindly offered
to stay with you and help in any way they can Mrs Stover I will leave
him in your hands Please call me if I can be of any assistance

Without waiting for further comment from the patient whose face was a
picture he hastened to the kitchen choking as he went Mr Stover met
him at the outer door

Now youve done it wailed the little man NOW youve done it Didnt
I tell you Oh thisll be a hell of a picnic

He stalked away righteous indignation overcoming him Brown sat down in
a rocking chair and shook with emotion From the direction of the sick
room came the sounds of three voices each trying to outscream the
other The substitute assistant listened to this for a while and as he
did so a new thought struck him He remembered a story he had read in a
magazine years before He crossed to the pantry found an empty bottle
rinsed it at the sink stepped again to the pantry and entering it
closed the door behind him There he busied himself with the molasses
jug the softsoap bucket the oil can the pepper shaker and a few
other utensils and their contents Footsteps in the kitchen caused him
to hurriedly reenter that apartment Mrs Stover was standing by the
range her face red

Oh there you are Mr Brown she exclaimed I wondered where youd
gone to

How is he inquired Brown the keenest anxiety in his utterance

Hm hed do well enough if he had the right treatment I callate hes
better now even as tis but when a person has to lay and hear over
and over again that what ails em is nothin but imagination it aint
to be wondered at that they get mad What he needs is some sort of
soothin medicine and I only wish twant so fur over to home Ive got
just what he needs there

I was thinking began Brown

What was you thinkin

I was wondering if some of my Stomach Balm wouldnt help him Its
an old family receipt handed down from the Indians I believe I always
have a bottle with me and    Still I wouldnt prescribe not knowing
the disease

Mrs Stovers eyes sparkled Patent medicines were her hobby

Hum she said Stomach Balm sounds good And he says his trouble is
principally stomach Some of them Indian medicines are mighty powerful
Have youdid you say you had a bottle with you Mr Brown

The young man went again to the pantry and returned with the bottle he
had so recently found there Now however it was two thirds full of
a black sticky mixture Mrs Stover removed the cork and took an
investigating sniff

It smells powerful she said hopefully

It is Would you like to taste it handing her a tablespoon He
watched as she swallowed a spoonful

Ugh oh she gasped even her long suffering palate rebelled at THAT
taste ItI should think that OUGHT to help him

I should think so It may be the very thing he needs At any rate it
cant hurt him Its quite harmless

Mrs Stovers face was still twisted under the influence of the Balm
but her mind was made up

Im goin to try it she declared I dont care if every New
Thoughter in creation says no He needs medicine and needs it right
away

The dose said Mr Brown gravely is two tablespoonfuls every
fifteen minutes I do hope it will help him Give him my sympathymy
deepest sympathy Mrs Stover please

The plump lady disappeared in the direction of the sick room The
substitute assistant lingered and listened He heard a shrill powwow
of feminine voices Evidently New Thought and the practice of medicine
had once more clashed The argument waxed and waned Followed the click
of a spoon against glass And then came a gasp a gurgle a choking
yell and high upon the salty air enveloping Eastboro TwinLights rose
the voice of Mr Seth Atkins expressing his opinion of the Stomach
Balm and those who administered it

John Brown darted out of the kitchen dodged around the corner of
the house tiptoed past the bench by the bluff where Mr Stover sat
gloomily meditating and ran lightly down the path to the creek and
the wharf The boathouse at the end of the wharf offered a convenient
refuge Into the building he darted closed the door behind him and
collapsed upon a heap of fish nets

At threethirty that afternoon Mr Atkins apparently quite recovered
was sitting in the kitchen rocker reading a last weeks newspaper one
of a number procured on his most recent trip to the village The Stovers
and their guest had departed Their buggy was out of sight beyond the
dunes A slight noise startled the lightkeeper and he looked up His
helper was standing in the doorway upon his face an expression of
intense and delighted surprise

What exclaimed Mr Brown What Is it really you

Seth put down the paper and nodded

Umhm he observed drily its really me

Up and WELL queried Brown

Umhm Pretty well considerin thank you Been for a stroll up
Washinton Street have you Or a little walk on the Common maybe

The elaborate sarcasm of these questions was intended to be withering
Mr Brown however did not wither Neither did he blush

I have been he said down at the boathouse I knew you were in safe
hands and well looked after so I went away I couldnt remain here and
hear you suffer

Hum HEAR me suffer hey Much obliged Im sure What have you been
doin there all this time I hoped you wasthat is I begun to be
afraid you was dead Thought your sympathy for me had been too much for
you maybe

Brown mournfully shook his head It wasalmost he said solemnly I
think I dropped asleep I was quite overcome

Hum Better take a dose of that Stomach Balm hadnt you Thatll
liven you up Ill guarantee

No thank you The sight of you well and strong again is all the
medicine I need We must keep the Balm in case you have another
attack By the way I notice the dinner dishes havent been washed Ill
do them at once I know you must be tired after your illnessand the
exertion of showing your guests about the lights

Atkins did not answer although he seemed to want to very much However
he made no objection when his helper rolling up his sleeves turned to
the sink and the dish washing

Seth was silent all the rest of the afternoon and during supper But
that evening as Brown sat on the bench outside Atkins joined him

Hello said Seth as cheerfully as if nothing had happened

Hello replied the assistant shortly He had been thinking once more
and his thoughts were not pleasant

I spose you callate began Atkins that maybe Ive got a grudge
against you on account of this mornin and that Balm and such I
aint

Thats good Im glad to hear it

Yes After the fust dose of that stufffor thunder sakes WHAT did you
put in itI was about ready to murder you but Ive got over that I
dont blame you for gettin even We are even you know

Im satisfied if you are

I be But what I dont understand is why you didnt want to show them
folks around

Oh I dont know I had my reasons such as they were Why didnt you
want to do it yourself

Seth crossed his legs and was silent for a moment or two Then he spoke
firmly and as if his mind was made up

Young feller he said I dont know whether you realize it or not
and perhaps I shouldnt be the one to mention itbut youre under some
obligations to me

His companion nodded I realize that he said

Yes but maybe you dont realize the amount of the obligations Im
riskin my job keepin you here If it want for the superintendent
bein such a friend of mine thered have been a reglar assistant
keeper appinted long ago The govment dont pick up its lightkeepers
same as you would farm hands Theres civil service to be gone through
and the like of that But you wanted to stay and Ive kept you riskin
my own job as I said And now I callate wed better have a plain
understandin Youve got to know just what your job is Im goin to
tell you

He stopped as if to let this sink in Brown nodded again All right
he observed carelessly go on and tell me Im listening

Your job around the lights you know already part of it But theres
somethin else Whenever men folks come here Ill do my share
of showin the place off But when women comewomen you
understandyouve got to be guide Ill forgive you todays doins I
tried to play a joke on you and you evened it up with a better one on
me Thats all right But after this showin the lights to females is
your job and youve got to do itor get out No hard feelins at all
and Id really hate to lose you but THATS got to be as I say

He rose evidently considering the affair settled Brown caught his coat
and pulled him back to the bench

Wait Atkins he said Im grateful to you for your kindness I like
you and Id like to please you but if what you say is final thenas
they used to say in some play or otherI guess youll have to hire
another boy

What You mean youll quit

Rather than do thatyes

But why

For reasons as I told you By the way you havent told me why you
object to acting as guide tofemales

Because they are females Theyre women darn em

Before his helper could comment on this declaration it was repeated
The lightkeeper shook both his big fists in the air

Darn em Darn all the women shouted Seth Atkins

Amen said John Brown devoutly

Seths fists dropped into his lap What he cried what did you say

I said Amen

Butbut    why    you didnt mean it

Didnt I bitterly Humph

Seth breathed heavily started to speak once more closed his lips on
the words rose walked away a few paces returned and sat down

John Brown he said solemnly if youre jokin the powers forgive
you for I wont If you aint II    See here do you remember
what you asked me that night when you struck me for the assistant
keepers job You asked me if I was married

Brown assented wonderingly Why yes he said I believe I did

You did And I aint been so shook up for many a day Young feller
Im goin to tell you what no other man in Ostable County knows I AM
married Ive got a wife livin




CHAPTER VII

OUT OF THE BAG


Im married and Ive got a wife livin continued Seth adding
hurriedly and fiercely dont you say nothin to me Dont you put me
out Im goin to tell you Im goin to tell you all of itall by
time I am if I die for it

He was speaking so rapidly that the words were jumbled together He
knocked his hat from his forehead with a blow of his fist and actually
panted for breath Brown had never before seen him in this condition

Hold on Wait he cried Atkins you neednt do this you mustnt I
am asking no questions We agreed to

Hush up Seth waved both hands in the air DONT you talk Let me get
this off my chest Good heavens alive Ive been smotherin myself
with it for years and now Ive got started Ill blow off steam or my
bilerll bust Im GOIN to tell you You listen

Yes sir Im a married man he went on I want always married you
understand I used to be single once Once I was single see

I see said Brown repressing a smile

Seth was not aware that there was anything humorous in his statement

Yes he said I was single andand happy by jiminy I was skipper
of a mackrel schooner down Cape Ann way never mind where and Seth
Atkins is only part of my name never mind that neither I sailed that
schooner and I run that schoonerI RUN her and when I said boo all
hands aboard jumped I tell you When Ive got salt water underneath me
Im a man But I told you that afore

However this is what I didnt tell you nor nobody else in this part of
the state I stayed single till I got to be past forty Everybody set me
down as an old bach Then I met a woman yes sir I met a woman

He made this assertion as if it was something remarkable His companion
on the bench made no comment

She was a widow woman went on Seth and she had a little property
left her by her first husband Owned a house and land she did and had
some money in the bank Some folks callated I married her for that but
they callated wrong I wanted her for herself And I got her Her name
was Emeline I always thought Emeline was a sort of pretty name

He sighed Brown observed that Emeline was a very pretty name indeed

Umhm Thats what I thought and Emeline was a real pretty woman for
her age and heftshe was fleshy She had some considerble prejudice
against my goin to sea so I agreed to stay on shore a spell and farm
it as you might say We lived in the house she owned and was real happy
together She bossed me around a good deal but I didnt mind bein
bossed by her Twas a change you see for Id always been used to
bossin other folks So I humored her And bein on land made me lose
mymy grip or somethin cause I seemed to forget how to boss But we
was happy and thenthen Bennie D come Consarn him

His teeth shut with a snap and he struck his knee with his fist
Consarn him he repeated and was silent

The substitute assistant ventured to jog his memory

Who was Bennie D he asked

What Hey Bennie D Oh he was her brotherinlaw her husbands
brother from up Boston way He was a geniusat least he said he
wasand an inventor The only invention I ever could larn hed
invented to a finish was how to live without workin but hed got that
brought to a science However he was forever fussin over some kind of
machine that was sartin sure to give power to the universe when twas
done and Emelines husbandhis name was Abnerthought the world and
all of him Fore he died he made Emeline promise to always be kind to
Bennie D and she said she would Abner left him a little money and he
spent it travelin for his health I dont know where he traveled
to but wherever twas the health must have been there He was the
healthiest critter ever I seeand the laziest

Well his travels bein over down he comes to make his sisterinlaw
a little visit And he stays on and stays on He never took no shine
to meI judge he figgered I hadnt no business sharin Abners
propertyand I never took to him much

Emeline noticed Bennie D and me want fallin on each others necks
any to speak of and it troubled her She blamed me for it Said Bennie
was a genius and geniuses had sensitive natures and had to be treated
with consideration and different from other folks And that promise to
Abner weighed on her conscience I callate Anyhow she petted that
blame inventor and it made me mad And yet I didnt say muchnot so
much as Id ought to I guess And Bennie D was always heavin out
little side remarks about Emelines bein fitted for better things than
she was gettin and how when his invention was perfected HED see
that she didnt slave herself to death and so on and so on And he had
considerble to say about folks tryin to farm when they didnt know
a cucumber from a watermelon and how farmin was a good excuse for
doin nothin and such And I didnt have any good answer to that
cause I do know more about seaweed than I do cucumbers and the farm
wasnt payin and I knew it

If hed said these things right out plain I guess likely Id have give
him what he deserved But he didnt he just hinted and smiled and acted
superior and pityin And if I got mad and hove out a little sailor talk
by accident hed look as sorry and shocked as the ComeOuter parson
does when theres a baby born to a Universalist family Hed get up
and shut the door as if he was scart the neighbors morals would
sufferthough the only neighbor within hearin was an old critter that
used to run a billiard saloon in Gloucester and HIS morals had been
put out of their misery forty years aforeand hed suggest that Emeline
better leave the room maybe And then Id feel ashamed and wouldnt
know what to do and twould end moren likely by my leavin it
myself

You can see how matters was driftin I could see plain enough and I
callate Emeline could tooIll give her credit for that She didnt
begin to look as happy as she had and that made me feel worse than
ever One time I found her cryin in the wash room and I went up and
put my arm round her

Emeline I says dont please dont Dont cry I know I aint the
husband Id ought to be to you but Im doin my best Im tryin to do
it I aint a genius I says

She interrupted me quick sort of half laughin and half cryin No
Seth says she you aint thats a fact

That made me sort of mad No I aint I says again and if you ask
me Id say one in the house was enough and to spare

I know you dont like Bennie she says

Taint that says I which was a lie It aint that I says but
somehow I dont seem to fit around here Bennie and me we dont seem to
belong together

He is Abners brother she says and I promised Abner I cant tell
him to go I cant tell him to leave this house his brothers house

Now consarn it there was another thing It WAS Abners house or
had been afore he died and now twas hers If I ever forgot that fact
which want by no means likely to happen Bennie D took occasions
enough to remind me of it So I was set back again with my canvas
flappin as you might say

No says I course you cant Hes your brotherinlaw

But you are my husband she says lookin at me kind of queer
Anyhow it seems kind of queer to me now Ive thought about that look
a good deal since and sometimes Ive wondered ifif    However
thats all past and by

Yes I says pretty average bitter but second husbands dont count
for much

Some of em dont seem to thats a fact she says

By jiminy I says I dont count for much in this house

Yes says she And whose fault is that

Well I WAS mad I tell you what I CAN do I sings out I can quit
this landlubbers job where Im nothin but a swab and go to sea again
where Im some account Thats what I can do

She turned and looked at me

You promised me never to go to sea again she says

Humph says I some promises are hard to keep

I keep mine hard or not says she Would you go away and leave me

Youve got Brother Bennie says I Hes a genius I aint nothin
but a man

She laughed pretty scornful Are you sartin youre that she wanted
to know

Not since I been livin here I aint I says And that ended that
try of makin up

And from then on it got worse and worse There want much comfort at
home where the inventor was so I took to stayin out nights Went down
to the store and hung around listenin to fools gabble and wishin
I was dead And the more I stayed out the more Bennie D laughed and
sneered and hinted And then come that ridiclous business about Sarah
Ann Christy That ended it for good and all

Seth paused in his long story and looked out across the starlit sea

Who was Sarah Ann asked Brown The lightkeeper seemed much
embarrassed

She was a born fool he declared with emphasis born that way and
been developin extry foolishness ever since She was a widow too been
good lookin once and couldnt forget it and she lived down nigh the
store When Id be goin down or comin back just as likely as not she
was settin on the piazza and shed hail me I didnt want to stop and
talk to her of course

No of course not

Well I DIDNT And I didnt HAVE to talk Couldnt if I wanted to
she done it all Her tongue was hung on ballbearin hinges and was
a selfwinder guaranteed to run an hour steady every time she set it
goin Talk my jiminy crimps how that woman could talk I couldnt
get away I tried to but my soul she wouldnt let me And if twas a
warm night shed moren likely have a pitcher of lemonade or some sort
of cold wash alongside and I must stop and taste it By time I can
taste it yet

Well there want no harm in her at all she was just a fool that had
to talk to somebody males preferred But my stayin out nights wasnt
helpin the joyfulness of things to home and one eveninone evenin
   Oh there I started to tell you this and I mights well get it
over

This evenin when I came home from the store I see somethin was extry
wrong soons I struck the settin room Emeline was there and Bennie
D and I give you my word I felt like turnin up my coat collar twas
so frosty Twas hottern a steamers stokehole outside but that room
was forty below zero

Nobody SAID nothin you knowthat was the worst of it but Id have
been glad if they had Finally I said it myself Well Emeline says
I here I be

No answer so I tried again Well Emeline says I Ive fetched
port finally

She didnt answer me then but Bennie D laughed He had a way of
laughin that made other folks want to cryor kill him For choice Id
have done the killin first

More nautical conversation sister says he He knows how fond you
are of that sort of thing

You see Emeline never did like to hear me talk sailor talk it
reminded her too much that I used to be a sailor I spose And that
inventor knew she didnt like it and so he rubbed it in every time I
made a slip Twas just one of his little ways he had a million of em

But I tried once more Emeline I says Im home Cant you speak to
me

Then she looked at me Yes Seth says she I see you are home

At last put in brotherinlaw There is no place like homewhen
the other places are shut up And he laughed again

Stop Bennie says Emeline and he stopped That was another of his
little waysto do anything she asked him Then she turned to me

Seth she asks where have you been

Oh down street says I casual Its turrible warm out

She never paid no attention to the weather signals Where bouts down
street she wanted to know

Oh down to the store I says

You go to the store a good deal dont you says she Bennie D
chuckled and then begged her pardon That chuckle stirred my mad up

I go where folks seem to be glad to see me I says Where they treat
me as if I was somebody

So you was at the store the whole evenin she asks

Course I was says I Where else would I be

She looked at me hard and her face sort of set She didnt answer
but took up the sewin in her lap and went to work on it I remember she
dropped it once and Bennie D jumped to pick it up for her quick as a
wink I set down in the rockin chair and took the Gloucester paper But
I didnt really read The clock ticked and ticked and twas so still
you could hear every stroke of the pendulum Finally I couldnt stand
it no longer

What on earth is the matter I sings out What have I done this
time Dont you WANT me to go to the store Is that it

She put down her sewin Seth says she quiet but awful cold I
want you to go anywheres that you want to go I neverll stand in your
way But I want you tell the truth about it afterwards

The truth says I Dont I always tell you the truth

No says she Youve lied to me tonight Youve been callin on the
Christy woman and you know it

Well you could have knocked me down with a babys rattle Id forgot
all about that fool Sarah Ann I callate I turned nineteen different
shades of red and for a minute I couldnt think of a word to say And
Bennie D smiled wicked as the Old Harry himself

Howhow did youhow do you know I see Sarah Ann Christy I hollered
out soons I could get my breath

Because you were seen there says she

Who see me

I did says she I went down street myself on an errand and bein
as you werent here to go with me Bennie was good enough to go It
aint pleasant for a woman to go out alone after dark andand I have
never been used to it she says

That kind of hurt me and pricked my conscience as you may say

You know Id been tickled to death to go with you Emeline I says
Any time you know it But you never asked me to go with you

How long has it been since you asked to go with me she says

Do you really want me to go anywheres Emeline says I eager Do
you I sposed you didnt If youd asked

Why should I always do the askin Must a wife always ask her husband
Doesnt the husband ever do anything on his own responsibility Seth
I married you because I thought you was a strong selfreliant man who
would advise me and protect me and

That cussed inventor bust into the talk right here I callate he
thought twas time

Excuse me sister he says dont humiliate yourself afore him
Remember you and me saw him tonight saw him with our own eyes settin
on a dark piazza with another woman Drinkin with her and

Drinkin I yells

Yes drinkin says he solemn I dont wonder you are ashamed of
it

Ashamed I aint ashamed

You hear that sister NOW I hope youre convinced

Twant nothin but lemonade I was drinkin I hollers pretty nigh
crazy She asked me to stop and have a glass cause twas so hot And
as for callin on her I want I was just passin by and she sings
out what a dreadful night twas and I said twas too and she says
wont I have somethin cold to drink Thats all there was to it

Afore Emeline could answer Bennie comes back at me again

Perhaps youll tell us this was the first time you have visited her
he purrs

Well that was a sockdolager cause twant the first time I dont
know how many times twas I never kept no account of em Too glad to
get away from her everlastin tongueclackin But when twas put right
up to me this way II declare I was all fussed up I felt sick and I
guess I looked so Emeline was lookin at me and seeminly waitin for
me to say somethin yet I couldnt say it And Bennie D laughed quiet
but wicked

That laugh fixed me I swung round and lit into him

You mind your own business I roars Aint you ashamed makin
trouble with a mans wife in his own house

I was under the impression the house belonged to my sisterinlaw he
says And again I was knocked off my pins

You great big loafer I yelled at him settin here doin nothin
but raisin the divil generally II

He jumped as if Id stuck a bradawl into him The shocked expression
came across his face again and he runs to Emeline and takes her arm

Sister sister he says quick but gentle this is no place for
you Language like that is    there there dont you think youd
better leave the room

She didnt go As I remember it now it keeps comin back to me that
she didnt go She just stood still and looked at me And then she says
Seth why did you lie to me

I didnt lie I shouts I forgot I tell you I never thought that
windmill of a Christy woman was enough importance to remember I didnt
lie to youI never did Oh Emeline you know I didnt Whats the
matter with you and me anyway We used to be all right and now were
all wrong

One of us is says Bennie D That was the final straw that choked the
camel

Yes I says to him thats right one of us is and I dont know
which But I know this you and I cant stay together in this house any
longer

I can see that room now as twas when I said that Us three lookin at
each other and the clock atickin and everything else still as still
I choked but I kept on

I mean it I says Either you clear out of this house or I do

And while the words was on my lips again it came to me strong that it
want really my house at all I turned to my wife

Emeline says I its got to be You must tell him to go or else

Shed been lookin at me again with that kind of queer look in her
eyes almost a hopeful look seems if twas and yet it couldnt have
been of course Now she drawed a long breath

I cant tell him to go Seth says she I promised to give him a
home as long as I had one

I set my jaws together All right I says then IM goin Good by

And I went Yes sir I went Just as I was without any hat or dunnage
of any kind When I slammed the back door it seemed as if I heard her
sing out my name I waited but I guess I was mistaken for she didnt
call it again Andand I never set eyes on her since No sir not
once

The lightkeeper stopped John Brown said nothing but he laid a
hand sympathetically on the older mans shoulder Seth shuddered
straightened and went on

I cleared out of that town that very night he said Walked clear
into Gloucester put up at a tavern there till mornin and then took
the cars to Boston I callated fust that Id ship as mate or somethin
on a foreign voyage but I couldnt somehow I couldnt bring myself to
do it You see Id promised her I wouldnt ever go to sea again and
sowell I was a dum idiot I spose but I wouldnt break the promise
I knew the superintendent of lighthouses in this district and Id been
an assistant keeper when I was younger I told him my yarn and he told
me about this job I changed my name passed the examination and come
directly here And here Ive stayed ever since

He paused again Brown ventured to ask another question

And yourand the lady he asked Where is she

I dont know Livin in her house back there on Cape Ann I spose She
was last I knew I never ask no questions I want to forgetto forget
by time    Hi hum    Well now you know what nobody this side of
Boston knows And you can understand why Im willin to be buried alive
down here Cause a woman wrecked my life Im done with women and to
this forsaken hole no women scarcely ever come But when they DO come
you must understand that I expect you to show em round After hearin
what Ive been through I guess youll be willin to do that much for
me

He rose evidently considering the affair settled Brown stroked his
chin

Im sorry Atkins he observed slowly and I certainly do sympathize
with you Butbut as I said I guess youll have to hire another
boy

What What do you mean

I mean that youre not the only womanhater on the beach

Hey Has a woman given YOU the go by

No The other way around if anything Look here Atkins Im not
in the habit of discussing my private affairs with acquaintances
but youve been frank with meand well hang it Ive got to talk to
somebody At least I feel that way just now Lets suppose a case
Suppose you were a young fellow not long out of collegea young fellow
whose mother was dead and whose dad was rich and head over heels in
moneymaking and with the idea that his will was no more to be disputed
than a law of the Almighty Just suppose that will you

Huh Well twill be hard supposin but Ill try Heave ahead

Suppose that youd never been used to working or supporting yourself
Had a position a nominal one in your dads office but absolutely no
responsibility all the money you wanted and so on Suppose because
your father wanted you toand HER people felt the sameyou had become
engaged to a girl a nice enough girl too in her way But then
suppose that little by little you came to realize that her way wasnt
yours You and she liked each other well enough but the whole thing
was a family arrangement a money arrangement a perfectly respectable
buyandsell affair That and nothing else And the more you thought
about it the surer you felt that it was so But when you told your
governor he got on his ear and sailed into you and you sailed back
until finally he swore that you should either marry that girl or hed
throw you out of his house and office to root for yourself What would
you do

Hey Land sakes I dont know I always HAD to root so I aint a
competent judge Go on youve got me interested

Well I said Id root thats all But I didnt have the nerve to go
and tell the girl The engagement had been announced and all that and
I knew what a mess it would make for her I sat in my room among
the things I was packing in my grip to take with me and thought and
thought If I went to her there would be a scene If I said I had been
disinherited she would want to know whynaturally I had quarreled
with the governoryes but why Then I should have to tell her the
real reason I didnt want to marry her or anybody else on such a
bargaincounter basis That seemed such a rotten thing to say and she
might ask why it had taken me such a long time to find it out No I
just COULDNT tell her that So after my think was over I wrote her
a note saying that my father and I had had a disagreement and he
had chucked me out or words to that effect Naturally under the
circumstances marriage was out of the question and I released her from
the engagement Good by and good luckor something similar I mailed
the letter and left the town the next morning

He paused The lightkeeper made no comment After a moment the young man
continued

I landed in Boston he said full of conceit and highminded ideas of
working my own way up the ladder But in order to work up youve got to
get at least a handhold on the bottom rung I couldnt get it Nobody
wanted a genteel loafer which was me My money gave out I bought a
steamboat passage to another city but I didnt have enough left to buy
a square meal Then by bull luck I fell overboard and landed here And
here I found the solution Im dead If the governor gets softhearted
and gets private detectives on my trail theyll find I disappeared
from that steamer thats all Drowned of course SHELL think so too
Good riddance to bad rubbish is the general verdict I can stay here
a year or so and then being dead and forgotten can go back to
civilization and hustle for myself BUT a woman is at the bottom of my
trouble and I never want to see another So if my staying here depends
upon my seeing them I guess as Ive said twice already youll have
to hire another boy

He too rose Seth laid a big hand on his shoulder

Son said the lightkeeper Im sorry for you I callate I know how
you feel I like you fustrate and if its a possible thing Ill fix
it sos you can stay right here longs you want to As for women folks
that do comewhy well dodge em if we can and share responsibility
if we must But theres one thing youve GOT to understand Youre
young and maybe your woman hatell wear off If it does out you go I
cant have any sparkin or lovemakin around these premises

The assistant snorted contemptuously

If ever you catch me being even coldly familiar with a female of any
age he declared I hereby request that you hit me politely but
firmly with that axe pointing to the kindling hatchet leaning against
the door post

Seth chuckled Good stuff he exclaimed And for my part if ever
you catch me gettin confectionery with a woman I    well dont
stop to pray over me just drown me thats all I ask Its a bargain
Shake

So they shook with great solemnity




CHAPTER VIII

NEIGHBORS AND WASPS


And now affairs at the lights settled down into a daily routine in
which the lightkeeper and his helper each played his appointed part
All mysteries now being solved and the trust between them mutual and
without reserve they no longer were on their guard in each others
presence but talked freely on all sorts of topics and expressed their
mutual dislike of woman with frequency and point No regular assistant
was appointed or seemed likely to be for the summer at least Seth and
his friend the superintendent held another lengthy conversation over
the wire and while Browns uncertain status remained the same there
was a tacit understanding that by the first of September if the young
man was sufficiently broken in the position vacated by Ezra Payne
should be hisif he still wanted it

You may change your mind by that time observed Seth This aint no
place for a chap with your trainin and I know it It does well enough
for an old derelict like me with nobody to care a hang whether he lives
or dies but youre different And even for me the lonesomeness of it
drives me most crazy sometimes Ive noticed youve been havin blue
streaks more often than when you first came I callate that by fall
youll be headin somewheres else Mr John Brown with significant
emphasis upon the name

Brown stoutly denied being bluer than usual and his superior did not
press the point Seth busied himself in his spare time with the work on
the Daisy M and with his occasional trips behind Joshua to the village
Brown might have made some of these trips but he did not care to
Solitude and seclusion he still desired and there were more of these
than anything else at the TwinLights

The lightkeeper experimented with no more dogs but he had evidently not
forgotten the lifesaving mans warning concerning possible thieves for
he purchased a big springlock in Eastboro and attached it to the door
of the boathouse on the little wharf The lock was at first a good
deal more of a nuisance than an advantage for the key was always being
forgotten or mislaid and on one occasion the door blew shut with
Atkins inside the building and he pounded and shrieked for ten minutes
before his helper heard him and descended to the rescue

June crawled by and July came Crawled is the proper word for John
Brown had never known days so long or weeks so unending as those of that
early summer The monotony was almost never broken and he began to find
it deadly He invented new duties about the lights and added swimming
and walks up and down the beach to his limited list of recreations

The swimming he especially enjoyed The cove made a fine bathing place
and the boathouse was his dressing room though the fragrance of the
ancient fish nets stored within it was not that of attar of roses A
cheap bathing suit was one of the luxuries Atkins had bought for him by
request in Eastboro Seth bought the suit under protest for he scoffed
openly at his helpers daily bath

I should think the lightkeeper declared over and over again that
youd had salt water soak enough to last you for one spell a feller
that come as nigh drownin as you done

Seth did not care for swimming the washtub every Saturday night
furnished him with baths sufficient

He was particular to warn his helper against the tide in the inlet The
coves all right he said but you want to look out and not try to
swim in the crick where its narrow or in that deep hole by the end of
the wharf where the lobster cars moored When the tides comin in or
its dead high water the currents strong there On the ebb itll snake
you out into the breakers sure as Im settin here tellin you The
coves all right and good and safe but keep away from the narrer part
of the crick

Swimming was good fun and walking on pleasant days was an aid in
shaking off depression but in spite of his denials and his attempts at
appearing contented the substitute assistant realized that he was far
from that happy condition He did not want to meet people least of all
people of his own station in lifehis former station Atkins was a
fine chap in his way but    Brown was lonely    and when one
is lonely one thinks of what might have been and perhaps regrets
Regrets unavailing regrets are the poorest companions possible

The lightkeeper too seemed lonely which considering his years
of experience in his present situation was odd He explained his
loneliness one evening by observing that he callated he missed the
painting chaps

What painting chaps asked Brown

Oh them two young fellers that always used to come to the
cottagewhat you call the bungalowacross the cove there the ones I
told you about They was real friendly sociable young chaps and I kind
of liked to have em runnin in and out Seems queer to have it July
and they not here to hail me and come over to borrow stuff And they was
forever settin around under white sunshades sloppin paint onto paper
I most wish they hadnt gone to Europe I callate youd have liked em
too

Perhaps said the helper doubtfully

Oh you would no perhaps about it It dont seem right to see the
bungalow all shuttered up and deserted this time of year Youd have
liked to meet them young painters they was your kind

Yes I know Perhaps thats why I shouldnt like to meet them

Hey    Oh yes yes I see I never thought of that But taint
likely theyd know you they hailed from Boston not New York

How did you know I came from New York I didnt tell you that

No you didnt thats a fact But you said you left the city where
you lived and came to Boston so I sort of guessed New York But thats
all right I dont know and I dont care Names and places you and me
might just as well not tell even to each other If we dont tell them
we can answer dont know to questions and tell the truth hey

One morning about a week later Brown his dish washing and sweeping
done was busy in the lightroom at the top of the right hand tower
polishing the brass of the lantern The curtains were drawn on the
landward side and those toward the sea open Seth having finished his
night watching and breakfast was audibly asleep in the house Brown
rubbed and polished leisurely his thoughts far away and a frown on his
face For the thousandth time that week he decided that he was a loafer
and a vagabond and that it would have been much better for himself
and creation generally if he had never risen after the plunge over the
steamers rail

He pulled the cloth cover over the glittering lantern and descended the
iron stair to the ground floor When he emerged into the open air he
heard a sound which made him start and listen The sound was the distant
rattle of wheels from the direction of the village Was another picnic
coming He walked briskly to the corner of the house and peered down the
winding road A carriage was in sight certainly but it was going not
coming He watched it move further away each moment Someonenot the
grocer or a tradesmanwas driving to the village But where had he
been and who was he Not Seth for Seth was asleephe could hear him

The driver of the carriage whoever he was had not visited the lights
And as Atkins had said there was nowhere else to go on that road
Brown puzzled looked about him at the sea the lights the house
the creek the cove the bluff on the other side of the cove the
bungalowah the bungalow

For the door of the bungalow was open and one or two of the shutters
were down The carriage had brought some person or persons to the
bungalow and left them there Instantly of course Brown thought of the
artists from Boston Probably they had changed their minds and decided
to summer at Eastboro after all His frown deepened

Then from across the cove from the bungalow came a shrill scream
a feminine scream The assistant started scarcely believing his ears
Before he could gather his wits a stout woman with a checked apron in
her hand rushed out of the bungalow door looked about saw him and
waved the apron like a flag

Hi she screamed Hi you Mr Lighthouseman come quick do please
come here quick and help us

There was but one thing to do and Brown did it instinctively He raced
through the beach grass down the hill in obedience to the call As he
ran he wondered who on earth the stout woman could be Seth had said
that the artists did their own housekeeping

Hurry up shrieked the stout woman dancing an elephantine fandango in
front of the bungalow Come ON

To run around the shore line of the cove would have taken a good deal of
time However had the tide been at flood there would have been no other
wayexcepting by boatto reach the cottage But the tide was out and
the narrowest portion of the creek the stream connecting the cove with
the ocean was but knee deep Through the water splashed the substitute
assistant and clambered up the bank beyond

Quick screamed the woman Theyll eat us alive

Who What panted Brown

Wasps Theyre in there The rooms full of em If theres one thing
on earth Im scart of its    Dont stop to talk Go IN

She indicated the door of a room adjoining the living room of the little
cottage From behind the door came sounds of upsetting furniture and
sharp slaps Evidently the artists were having a lively time But they
must be curious chaps to be afraid of wasps Brown opened the door and
entered partly of his own volition partly because he was pushed by the
stout woman Then he gasped in astonishment

The wasps were there dozens of them and they had built a nest in the
upper corner of the room But they were not the astonishing part of the
picture A young woman was there also a young woman with dark hair and
eyes the sleeves of a white shirtwaist rolled above her elbows and a
wet towel in her right hand She was skipping lightly about the room
slapping frantically at the humming insects

Mrs Bascom she panted dont stand there screaming Get another
towel and

Then she turned and saw Brown For an instant she too seemed
astonished But only for an instant

Oh Im so glad you came she exclaimed Here take this you must
hit quick and HARD

This was the towel The assistant took it mechanically The young lady
did not wait to give further orders She rushed out of the room and shut
the door Brown was alone with the wasps and they were lively company
When at last the battle was over the last wasp was dead the nest was
a crumpled gray heap over in the corner and the assistants brow was
ornamented with four red and smarting punctures which promised to
shortly become picturesque and painful lumps Rubbing these absently
with one hand and bearing the towel in the other he opened the door
and stepped out into the adjoining room

The two women were awaiting him He found them standing directly in
front of him as he emerged

Have youhave you killed them begged the younger of the pair

Be they all dead demanded the other

Brown nodded solemnly I guess so he said They seem to be

Oh Im so glad cried the dark haired girl Imweare so much
obliged to you

If theres any critters on earth declared the stout woman that I
cant stand its wasps and hornets and such Mice I dont mind

I do interrupted her companion with emphasis

But when I walked into that room and seen that nest in the corner I was
pretty nigh knocked overand she added it takes considerble to do
that to ME

The assistant looked at her Yes he said absently I should think
it might That is I meanII beg your pardon

He paused and wiped his forehead with the towel The young lady burst
into a peal of laughter in which the stout woman joined The laugh was
so infectious that even Brown was obliged to smile

I apologize he stammered I didnt mean that exactly as it sounded
Im not responsible mentallyyetI guess

I dont wonder It was the stout woman who answered The girl had
turned away and was looking out the window her shoulders shook I
shouldnt think you would be Hauled in bodily as you might say and
shut up in a room to fight wasps And by folks you never saw afore and
dont know from Adam You neednt apologize Id forgive you if you
said somethin a good deal worsen that Im long past the age where Im
sensitive about my weight thank goodness

And we ARE so much obliged to you The girl was facing him once more
and she was serious though the corners of her mouth still twitched
The whole affair is perfectly ridiculous she said but Mrs Bascom
was frightened and so was Iwhen I had time to realize it Thank you
again

Youre quite welcome Im sure No trouble at all

The assistant turned to go His brain was beginning to regain a little
of its normal poise and he was dimly conscious that he had been absent
from duty quite long enough

Maybe youd like to know who tis youve helped observed the stout
woman And considerin that were likely to be nextdoor neighbors
for a spell I callate introductions are the proper thing My names
Bascom Im housekeeper for Miss Ruth Graham This is Miss Graham

The young lady offered a hand Brown took it

Graham he repeated Where Then remembering a portion of what Seth
had told him he added I see thethe artist

My brother is an artist He and his friend Mr Hamilton own this
bungalow They are abroad this summer and I am going to camp here for a
few weeksMrs Bascom and I I paint a little too but only for fun

Brown murmured a conventionality concerning his delight at meeting the
pair and once more headed for the door But Mrs Bascoms curiosity
would not permit him to escape so easily

I thought she said when I see you standin over there by the
lights that you must be one of the keepers Not the head keeperI
knew you want himbut an assistant maybe But I guess youre only a
visitor MisterMister

Brown

Yes Mr Brown I guess you aint no keeper are you

I am the assistant keeper at present Yes

You dont say Mrs Bascom looked surprised So too did Miss Graham
You dont look like a lighthouse keeper continued the former Oh I
dont mean your clothes noticing the young mans embarrassed glance at
his wet and far from immaculate garments I mean the way you talk and
act You aint been here long have you

No

Just come this summer

Yes

I thought so You aint a Cape Codder

No

I was sure you want Where DO you come from

Brown hesitated Miss Graham noticing his hesitation hastened to end
the inquisition

Mr Brown cant stop to answer questions Mrs Bascom she said Im
sure he wants to get back to his work Good morning Mr Brown No doubt
we shall see each other often being the only neighbors in sight Call
againdo I solemnly promise that you shall have to fight no more
wasps

Say The stout woman took a step forward Speakin of wasps   
stand still a minute Mr Brown wont you Whats them lumps on your
forehead Why I do believe youve been bit You have sure and sartin

Miss Graham was very much concerned Oh no she exclaimed I hope
not Let me see

No indeed The assistant was on the step by this time and moving
rapidly Nothing at all No consequence Good morning

He almost ran down the hill and crossed the creek at the wading place
As he splashed through the voice of the housekeeper reached his ears

Cold muds the best thing she screamed Put it on thick It takes
out the smart Good and thick mind

For the next hour or two the lightkeepers helper moved about his
household tasks in a curious frame of mind He was thoroughly angryor
thought he wasand very much disturbed Neighbors of any kind were
likely to be a confounded nuisance but two women Heavens And the
stout woman was sure to be running in for calls and to borrow things As
for the other she seemed a nice girl enough but he never wanted to see
another girl nice or otherwise Her eyes were pretty so was her hair
but what of it Oh hang the luck Just here he banged his swollen
forehead on the sharp edge of the door and found relief in profanity

Seth Atkins was profane also when he heard the news Brown said
nothing until his superior discovered with his own eyes that the
bungalow was open Then in answer to the lightkeepers questions came
the disclosure of the truth

Women roared Seth You say theres two WOMEN goin to live there By
Judas I dont believe it

Go and see for yourself then was the brusque answer

I shant neither Who told you

They did

They DID Was you there

Yes

What for I thought you swore never to go nigh a woman again

I did butwell it wasnt my fault I

Yes Go on

I went because I couldnt help myself Went to help some one else in
fact I expected to find Graham and that other artist But

Well go ON

I was stung said Mr Brown gloomily and rubbed his forehead




CHAPTER IX

THE BUNGALOW GIRL


During the following day the occupants of the lightkeepers dwelling saw
little or nothing of the newcomers at the bungalow Brown his forehead
resembling a section of a relief map of the Rocky Mountains remained
indoors as much as possible working when there was anything to do and
reading backnumber magazines when there was not Seth went as usual
to his room soon after noon His slumbers must however have been
fitful ones for several times the substitute assistant turning
quickly saw the bedroom door swing silently shut The third time that
this happened he ran to the door and threw it open in season to catch
Mr Atkins in an undignified dive for the bed A tremendous snore
followed the dive The young man regarded him in silence for a few
moments during which the snores continued Then he shook his head

Humph he soliloquized I must phone for the doctor at once Either
the doctor or the superintendent If he has developed that habit he
isnt fit for this job

He turned away The slumberer stirred uneasily rolled over opened one
eye and sat up

Hi he called Come back here Where you goin

Brown returned looking surprised and anxious

Oh he exclaimed are you awake

Course Im awake What a fool question that is Think Im settin up
here and talkin in my sleep

Well I didnt know

Why didnt you know And see here what did you mean by sayin you was
goin to phone the doctor or the superintendent one or tother Yes
you said it I heard you

Oh no you didnt

Tell you I did Heard you with my own ears

But how could you You werent awake

Course I was awake Couldnt have heard you unless I was could I What
ails you Them stings go clear through to your brains did they

Again Brown shook his head

This is dreadful he murmured He walks in his sleep and snores when
hes awake I MUST call the doctor

Whatwhat The lightkeepers wrath was interfering with his
utterance He swung his legs over the side of the bed and sputtered
incoherently

Be calm Atkins coaxed the assistant Dont complicate your diseases
by adding heart trouble Three times today Ive caught you peeping at me
through the crack of that door Within fifteen seconds of the last peep
I find you snoring Therefore I say

Aw belay I was onlyonly just lookin out to see what time it was

But you must have done it in your sleep because

I never I was wide awake as you be

But why did you snore You couldnt have fallen asleep between the door
and the bed And you hadnt quite reached the bed when I got here

IIIAw shut up

Brown smiled blandly I will he said provided you promise to keep
this door shut and dont do any more spying

Spyin What do you mean by that

Just what I said You and I had a discussion concerning that same
practice when I fell over the bank at the Slough a while ago I was not
spying then but you thought I was and you didnt like it Now I think
you are and I dont like it

Whwhatwhat would I be spyin on you for Whwhat reason would I
have for doin it

No good reason because I have no intention of visiting our new
neighborsnone whatever That being understood perhaps youll shut the
door and keep it shut

Seth looked sheepish and guilty

Well he said after a moments reflection I beg your pardon But
I couldnt help feelin kind of uneasy II ought to know better I
spose but with a young goodlookin girl landed unexpected right
next to us II

How did you know she was goodlooking I didnt mention her looks

No you didnt butbut    John Brown Ive been young myself and
I know that at your age most ANY girls goodlookin There

He delivered this bit of wisdom with emphasis and a savage nod of the
head Brown had no answer ready that is no relevant answer

You go to bed and shut the door he repeated turning to go

All right I will But dont you forget our agreement

I have no intention of forgetting it

What ARE you goin to do

Do What do you mean

I mean what are you goin to do now that things down heres changed
and you and me aint alone same as we was

I dont know Im not sure that I shant leaveclear out

What Clear out Run away and leave me alone toto    By time I
didnt think you was a deserter

The substitute assistant laughed bitterly You neednt worry he said
I couldnt go far even if I wanted to I havent any money

Thats so Seth was evidently relieved All right he observed
dont you worry Twont be but a couple of months anyway and well
fight it through together But aint it a shame Aint it an everlastin
shame that this had to happen just as wed come to understand each other
and was so contented and friendly Well theres only one thing to do
thats to make the best of it for us and the worst for them Well keep
to ourselves and pay no attention to em no moren if they want
there Well forget em altogether hey    I say well forget em
altogether wont we

Browns answer was short and sharp

Yes he said and slammed the door behind him Seth slowly shook his
head before he laid it on the pillow He was not entirely easy in his
mind even yet

However there was no more spying and the lightkeeper did not mention
the bungalow tenants when he appeared at supper time After the meal
he bolted to the lights and was on watch in the tower when his helper
retired

Early the next afternoon Brown descended the path to the boathouse He
had omitted his swim the day before Now however he intended to have
it Simply because those female nuisances had seen fit to intrude where
they had no business was no reason why he should resign all pleasure He
gave a quick glance upward at the opposite bank as he reached the wharf
There was no sign of life about the bungalow

He entered the boathouse undressed and donned his bathing suit In a
few minutes he was ready and emerging upon the wharf walked briskly
back along the shore of the creek to where it widened into the cove
There he plunged in and was soon luxuriating in the cool clear water

He swam with long confident strokes those of a practiced swimmer This
was worth while It was the one place where he could forget that he
was no longer the only son of a wealthy father heir to a respected
namewhich was NOT Browna young man with all sorts of brilliant
prospects could forget that he was now a disinherited vagabond a
loafer who had been unable to secure a respectable position an outcast
He swam and dove and splashed rejoicing in his strength and youth and
the freedom of all outdoors

Then as he lay lazily paddling in deep water he heard the rattle of
gravel on the steep bank of the other side of the cove Looking up
he saw to his huge disgust a female figure in a trim bathing suit
descending the bluff from the bungalow It was the girl who had left
him to fight the wasps Her dark hair was covered with a jauntily tied
colored handkerchief and against the yellow sand of the bluff she
made a very pretty picture Not that Brown was interested but she did
nevertheless

She saw him and waved a hand Good morning she called Beautiful day
for a swim isnt it

Yes growled the young man brusquely He turned and began to swim in
the opposite direction up the cove The girl looked after him raised a
puzzled eyebrow and then with a shrug waded into the water The next
time the assistant looked at her she was swimming with long sweeping
strokes down the narrow creek to the bend and the deep hole at the end
of the wharf Round that bend and through that hole the tide whirled
like a rapid out into the miniature bay behind Black Mans Point It
was against that tide that Seth Atkins had warned him

And the girl was swimming directly toward the dangerous narrows Brown
growled an exclamation of disgust He had no mind to continue the
acquaintance and yet he couldnt permit her to do that

Miss Graham he called Oh Miss Graham

She heard him but did not stop

Yes she called in answer continuing to swim What is it

You mustnt shouted Brown Then he remembered that he must not
shout Shouting might awaken the lightkeeper and the latter would
misunderstand the situation of course So he cut his warning to one
word

Wait he called and began swimming toward her She did not come to
meet him but merely ceased swimming and turned on her back to float
And floating the tide would carry her on almost as rapidly as if she
assisted it That tide did not need any assistance Brown swung on his
side and settled into the racing stroke the stroke which had won him
cups at the athletic club

He reached her in a time so short that she was surprised into an
admiring comment

Oh she exclaimed you CAN swim

He did not thank her for the compliment There was no time for that
even if he had felt like it

You shouldnt be here he said sharply

She looked at him

Why what do you mean she demanded

It isnt safe A little farther and the tide would carry you out to
sea Come back back up to the cove at once

He expected her to ask more questions but she did not Instead she
turned and struck out in silence Against the tide even there the pull
was tremendous

Shall I help you he asked

No I can make it

And she did It was his turn to be surprised into admiration

By Jove he panted as they swung into the quiet water of the cove and
stood erect in the shallows that was great You are a good swimmer

Thank you she answered breathlessly It WAS a tug wasnt it Thank
you for warning me Now tell me about the dangerous places please

He told her repeating Seths tales of the tides strength

But it is safe enough here she asked

Oh yes perfectly safe anywhere this side of the narrow partthe
creek

Im so glad This water is glorious and I began to be afraid I should
have to give it up

The creek and even the bay itself are safe enough at flood he went
on I often go there then When the tide is coming in it is all right
even for

He paused She finished the sentence for him Even for a girl you were
going to say She waded forward to where the shoal ended and the deeper
part began There she turned to look at him over her shoulder

Im going to that beach over there she said pointing across the
cove Do you want to race

Without waiting to see whether he did or not she struck out for the
beach And without stopping to consider why he did it the young man
followed her

The race was not so onesided Brown won it by some yards but he had to
work hard His competitor did not give up when she found herself falling
behind but was game to the end

Well she gasped you beat me didnt you I never could get that
side stroke and its ever so much faster

Its simple enough Just a knack Ill teach you if you like

Will you Thats splendid

You are the strongest swimmer Miss Graham for a girl that I ever
saw You must have practiced a great deal

Yes Horacemy brothertaught me He is a splendid swimmer one of
the very best

Horace Graham Why you dont mean Horace Graham of the Harvard
Athletic

Yes I do He is my brother But how    Do you know him

The surprise in her tone was evident Brown bit his lip He remembered
that Cape Cod lightkeepers helpers were not as a usual thing supposed
to be widely acquainted in college athletic circles

I have met him he stammered

But where she began and then why of course you met him here I
forgot that he has been your neighbor for three summers

The assistant had forgotten it too but he was thankful for the
reminder

Yes Yes certainly he said She regarded him with a puzzled look

Its odd he didnt mention you she observed He has told me a great
deal about the bungalow and the sea views and the loneliness and the
quaintness of it all That was what made me wish to spend a month
down here and experience it myself And he has often spoken with an
irrepressible smile of yourof the lightkeeper Mr Atkins That is
his name isnt it

Yes

I want to meet him Horace said he waswell rather odd but when you
knew him a fine fellow and full of dry humor Im sure I should like
him

Brown smiled alsoand broadly He mentally pictured Seths reception
of the news that he was liked by the young lady across the cove And
then it occurred to him with startling suddenness that he had been
conversing very familiarly with that young lady notwithstanding the
solemn interchange of vows between the lightkeeper and himself

I must be going he said hastily good morning Miss Graham

He waded to the shore and strode rapidly back toward the boathouse His
companion called after him

I shall expect you tomorrow afternoon she said Youve promised to
teach me that side stroke remember

Brown dressed in a great hurry and climbed the path to the lights at the
double quick All was safe and serene in the house and he breathed more
freely Atkins was sound asleep really asleep in the bedroom and when
he emerged he was evidently quite unaware of his helpers unpremeditated
treason Browns conscience pricked him however and he went to
bed that night vowing over and over that he would be more careful
thereafter He would take care not to meet the Graham girl again Having
reached this decision there remained nothing but to put her out of his
mind entirely which he succeeded in doing at a quarter after eleven
when he fell asleep Even then she was not entirely absent for he
dreamed a ridiculous dream about her

Next day he did not go for a swim but remained in the house Seth at
supper demanded to know what ailed him

Youre as mum as the oldest inhabitant of a deaf and dumb asylum was
the lightkeepers comment And ugly as a bull in fly time What ails
you

Nothing

Humph better take somethin for it seems to me Little Stomach
Balm hey No Well GO to bed Your rooms enough sight bettern your
company just now

The helpers ill nature was in evidence again at breakfast time Seth
endeavored to joke him out of it but not succeeding and finding
his best jokes received with groans instead of laughter gave it up in
disgust and retired The young man cleared the table piled the dishes
in the sink heated a kettleful of water and began the days drudgery
drudgery which he once thought was fun

Why had he had the ill luck to fall overboard from that steamer Or
why didnt he drown when he did fall overboard Then he would have been
comfortably dead at all events Why hadnt he stayed in New York or
Boston or somewhere and kept on trying for a position for workany
kind of work He might have starved while trying but people who were
starving were selfrespecting and when they met other peoplefor
instance sisters of fellows they used to knowhad nothing to be
ashamed of and neednt lieunless they wanted to He was a common
loafer under a false name down on a sandheap washing dishes At this
point he dropped one of the dishesa plateand broke it

Dn observed John Brown under his breath but with enthusiasm

He stooped to pick up the fragments of the plate and rising once more
to an erect position found himself facing Miss Ruth Graham She was
standing in the doorway

Dont mind me please she said No doubt I should feel the same way
if it were my plate

The young mans first move after recovery was to make sure that the
door between the kitchen and the hall leading to the lightkeepers
bedroom was shut It was fortunately The young lady watched him in
silence though her eyes were shining

Good morning Mr Brown she observed gravely

The assistant murmured a good morning from force of habit

Theres another piece you havent picked up continued the visitor
pointing

Brown picked up the piece

Is Mr Atkins in inquired the girl

Yes heshes in

May I see him please

II

If hes busy I can wait She seated herself in a chair Dont let me
interrupt you she continued You were busy too werent you

I was washing dishes declared Brown savagely

Oh

Yes Washing and sweeping and doing scrubwomans work are my regular
employments

Indeed Then Im just in time to help Is this the dish towel
regarding it dubiously

It is but I dont need any help thank you

Of course you do Everyone is glad to be helped at doing dishes I may
as well make myself useful while Im waiting for Mr Atkins

She picked up a platter and proceeded to wipe it quite as a matter of
course Brown swearing inwardly turned fiercely to the suds

Did you wish to see Atkins on particular business he asked a moment
later

Oh no I wanted to make his acquaintance thats all Horace told me
so many interesting things about him By the way was it last summer or
the summer before that you met my brother here

No answer Miss Graham repeated her question Was it last summer or the
summer before she asked

OherI dont remember Last summer I think

Why you must remember How could any one forget anything that happened
down here So few things do happen I should say So you met him last
summer

Yes

Hum thats odd

Shall I call Atkins Hes in his room

I say it is odd because when Mrs Bascom and I first met you you
told us this was your first summer here

There wasnt any answer to this at least the assistant could think of
none at the moment

Do you wish me to call Atkins he asked sharply Hes asleep but I
can wake him

Oh hes asleep Now I understand why you whisper even when you
swthat is when you break a plate You were afraid of waking him How
considerate you are

Brown put down the dishcloth It isnt altogether consideration for
himor for myself he said grimly I didnt care to wake him unless
you took the responsibility

Why

Because Miss Graham Seth Atkins took the position of lightkeeper here
almost for the sole reason that no women ever came here Mr Atkins is a
womanhater of the most rabid type Ill wake him up if you wish but I
wont be responsible for the consequences

The young lady stared at him in surprise delighted surprise apparently
judging by the expression of her face

A womanhater she repeated Is he really

He is Mr Brown neglected to add that he also had declared himself a
member of the same fraternity Perhaps he thought it was not necessary

A womanhater Miss Graham fairly bubbled with mischievous joy Oh
jolly now Im CRAZY to meet him

The assistant moved toward the hall door Very good he observed with
grim determination I think hell cure your lunacy

His hand was outstretched toward the latch when the young lady spoke
again

Wait a minute she said Perhaps I had better not wake him now

Just as you say The pleasure isor will beentirely mine I assure
you

Noo On the whole I think Ill wait until later I may call again
Good morning

She moved across the threshold Then standing on the mica slab which
was the step to the kitchen door she turned to say

You didnt swim yesterday

Noo II was busy

I see

She paused as if expecting him to say something further on the subject
He was silent Her manner changed

Good morning she said coldly and walked off The assistant watched
her as she descended the path to the cove but she did not once look
back Brown threw himself into a chair He had never hated anyone as
thoroughly as he hated himself at the moment

What a cheerful liar she must think I am he reflected She caught me
in that fool yarn about meeting her brother here last summer and now
after deliberately promising to teach her that stroke I dont go near
her What a miserable liar she must think I am And I guess I am By
George I cant be such a cad Ive got to make good somehow I must
give her ONE lesson I must

The tide served for bathing about three that afternoon At ten minutes
before that hour the substitute assistant keeper of Eastboro TwinLights
tiptoed silently to the bedroom of his superior and peeped in Seth was
snoring peacefully Brown stealthily withdrew At three precisely he
emerged from the boathouse on the wharf clad in his bathing suit

Fifteen minutes after three Seth Atkins in his stocking feet and with
suspicion in his eye crept along the path to the edge of the bluff
Crouching behind a convenient sand dune he raised his head and peered
over it

Below him was the cove its pleasant waters a smooth deep blue
streaked and bordered with pale green But the water itself did not
interest Seth In that water was his helper John Brown of nowhere in
particular John Brown the hater of females busily engaged in teaching
a young woman to swim

Atkins watched this animated picture for some minutes Then carefully
crawling back up to the path until he was well out of possible sight
from the cove he rose to his feet raised both hands and shook their
clenched fists above his head

The liar grated Mr Atkins between his teeth The traitor The
young blackguard After tellin me that he    And after my doin
everything for him that    Oh by Judas wait only wait till he
comes back ILL larn him ILL show him Oh by jiminy crimps

He strode toward the doorway of the kitchen There he stopped short
A woman was seated in the kitchen rocker a stout woman with her back
toward him The room in contrast to the bright sunshine without was
shadowy and Seth for an instant could see her but indistinctly
However he knew who she must bethe housekeeper at the
bungalowBasket or Biscuit his helper had said was her name as
near as he could remember it The lightkeeper ground his teeth Another
female Well he would teach this one a few things

He stepped across the threshold

Maam he began sharply perhaps youll tell me what you

He stopped The stout woman had at the sound of his step risen from
the chair and turned to face him And now she was staring at him her
face almost as white as the stonechina cups and saucers on the table

Why    why    SETH she gasped

The lightkeeper staggered back until his shoulders struck the doorpost

Good Lord he cried good    LORD WhywhyEMELINE

For over a minute the pair stared at each other white and speechless
Then Mrs Bascom hurried to the door darted out and fled along the
path around the cove to the bungalow Atkins did not follow her he did
not even look in the direction she had taken Instead he collapsed in
the rockingchair and put both hands to his head




CHAPTER X

THE BUNGALOW WOMAN


When an hour later the swimming teacher his guilty conscience
pricking him and the knowledge of having been false to his superior
strong within him came sneaking into the kitchen he was startled and
horrified to find the lightkeeper awake and dressed Mentally he braced
himself for the battery of embarrassing questions which he felt sure
he should have to answer It might be that he must face something more
serious than questions Quite possible Seth finding him absent had
investigatedand seen Well if he had then he had that was all The
murder would be out and Eastboro TwinLights would shortly be shy a
substitute assistant keeper

But there were no embarrassing questions Atkins scarcely noticed
him Seated in the rocker he looked up as the young man entered and
immediately looked down again He seemed to be in a sort of waking dream
and only dimly conscious of happenings about him

Hello hailed the assistant with an assumption of casual
cheerfulness

Hey Oh how be you was Mr Atkinss reply

Ive been for my dip explained Brown The water was fine today

Want to know

Youre up early arent you

Hey Yes I guess likely I be

Whats wrong Not sick are you

No Course I aint sick Say Seth seemed to take a sudden interest in
the conversation you come straight up from the cove have you

Yes Why

You aint been hangin around outside here have you

Hanging around outside What do you mean

Nothin Why do you stand there starin at me as if I was some sort of
dime show curiosity Anything queer about me

No I didnt know I was staring The young man was bewildered by
this strange behavior He was prepared for suspicion concerning his own
actions but Seth seemed rather to be defending himself from suspicion
on the part of his helper

Humph The lightkeeper looked keenly at him for a moment Then he
said

Well aint there nothin to do but stand around Gettin pretty nigh
to supper time aint it Put the kettle on and set the table

It was not supper time but Brown obeyed orders Seth went to cooking
He spoke perhaps three words during the culinary operations and a half
dozen more during the meal of which he ate scarcely a mouthful After
it was over he put on his cap and went out not to his usual lounging
spot the bench but to walk a full half mile along the edge of the
bluff and there sit in the seclusion of a clump of bayberry bushes
and gaze stonily at nothing in particular Here he remained until the
deepening dusk reminded him that it was time the lights were burning
Returning he lit the lanterns and sat down in the room at the top of
the lefthand tower to think and think and think

The shadows deepened the last flush of twilight faded from the western
sky the stars came out night and the black silence of night shrouded
Eastboro TwinLights The clock in the tower room ticked on to nine and
then to ten Still Seth sat a huddled dazed figure in the camp chair
by the great lantern At last he rose and went out on the iron balcony
He looked down at the buildings below him they were black shapes
without a glimmer Brown had evidently gone to bed In the little stable
Joshua thumped the side of his stall once or twicedreaming perhaps
that he was again pursued by the flypapered Joband subsided Atkins
turned his gaze across the inlet In the rear window of the bungalow a
dim light still burned As he watched it was extinguished He groaned
aloud and with his arms on the railing thought and thought

Suddenly he heard sounds faint but perceptible above the low grumble
of the surf They were repeated the sounds of breaking sticks as if
some one was moving through the briers and bushes beyond the stable
Some one was moving there coming along the path from the upper end of
the cove Around the corner of the stable a bulky figure appeared It
came on until it stood beneath the balcony

Seth called a low voice Seth are you there

For a moment the agitated lightkeeper could not trust his voice to
answer

Seth repeated the voice Seth

The figure was moving off in the direction of the other tower Then Seth
answered

Herehere I be he stammered in a hoarse whisper Who is it

He knew who it was perfectly well the question was quite superfluous

Its me said the voice Let me in Ive got to talk to you

Slowly scarcely certain that this was not a part of some dreadful
nightmare Seth descended the iron ladder to the foot of the tower
dragged his faltering feet to the door and slowly swung it open The
bulky figure entered instantly

Shut the door said Mrs Bascom

Hey What stammered Seth

I say shut that door Hurry up Land sakes HURRY Do you suppose I
want anybody to know Im here

The lightkeeper closed the door The clang reverberated through the
tower like distant thunder The visitor started nervously

Mercy she exclaimed what a racket What made you slam it

Didnt grumbled Seth Any kind of a noise sounds up in here

I should think as much Its enough to wake the dead

Aint nobody BUT the dead to wake in this place

Yes there is theres that young man of yours that Brown one He
aint dead is he

Humph hes asleep and thats next door to deadwith him

Well Im glad of it My nerves are pretty steady as a general thing
but I declare Im all of a twitter tonightand no wonder Its darker
than a pocket in here Cant we have a light

Atkins stumbled across the stone floor and took the lantern from
the hook by the stairs He struck a match and it went out he tried
another with the same result Mrs Bascom fidgeted

Mercy on us she cried what DOES ail the thing

Seths trembling fingers could scarcely hold the third match He raked
it across the whitewashed wall and broke the head short off

Thunder to mighty he snarled under his breath

But what DOES

What does What do you spose You aint the only one thats got
nerves are you

The next trial was successful and the lantern was lighted With it in
his hand he turned and faced his caller They looked at each other
Mrs Bascom drew a long breath

It is you she said I couldnt scarcely believe it It is really
you

Seths answer was almost a groan Its you he said Youdown here

This ended the conversation for another minute Then the lady seemed to
awake to the realities of the situation

Yes she said its meand its you Were here both of us Though
why on earth YOU should be I dont know

Me Me Why I belong here But youwhat in time sent you here
Unless with returning suspicion you came because I

He paused warned by the expression on his callers face

What was that she demanded

Nothin

Nothin I guess If you was flatterin yourself with the idea that I
came here to chase after you you never was more mistaken in your life
or ever will be You set down You and I have got to talk Set right
down

The lightkeeper hesitated Then he obeyed orders by seating himself on
an oil barrel lying on its side near the wall The lantern he placed on
the floor at his feet Mrs Bascom perched on one of the lower steps of
the iron stairs

Now she said weve got to talk Seth Bascom

Seth started violently

What is it asked the lady Why did you jump like that Nobody
comin is there

No No    But I couldnt help jumpin when you called me that name

That name Its your name isnt it Oh she smiled slightly I
remember now Youve taken the name of Atkins since we saw each other
last

I didnt take it it belonged to me You know my middle name I just
dropped the Bascom thats all

I see Just as you droppedsome other responsibilities Why didnt
you drop the whole christenin and start fresh Why did you hang on to
Seth

The lightkeeper looked guilty Mrs Bascoms smile broadened I know
she went on You didnt really like to drop it all It was too much of
a thing to do on your hook and there wasnt anybody to tell you to do
it and so you couldnt quite be spunky enough to

He interrupted her That want the reason he said shortly

What was the reason

You want to know do you

Yes I do

Well the Bascom part want mine no morenot all mine Id given it
to you

Ooh oh I see And you ran away from your name as you ran away from
your wife I see And    why of course you came down here to run
away from all the women Miss Ruth said this mornin she was toldI
dont know who bythat the lightkeeper was a womanhater Are you the
womanhater Seth

Mr Atkins looked at the floor Yes I be he answered sullenly Do
you wonder

I dont wonder at your runnin away that I should have expected But
there more briskly this aint gettin us anywhere Youre hereand
Im here Now whats your idea of the best thing to be done under the
circumstances

Seth shifted his feet One of us better go somewheres else if you ask
me he declared

Run away again you mean Well I shant run away Im Miss Ruths
housekeeper for the summer I answered her advertisement in the Boston
paper and we agreed as to wages and so on I like her and she likes me
Course if Id known my husband was in the neighborhood I shouldnt have
come here but I didnt know it Now Im here and Ill stay my time out
What are you goin to do

Im goin to send in my resignation as keeper of these lights Thats
what Im goin to do and Ill do it tomorrow

Run away again

Yes

Why

Why WHY Emeline Bascom do you ask me that

I do yes See here Seth we aint children nor sentimental young
folks Were sensible or wed ought to be Land knows were old enough
I shall stay here and you ought to Nobody knows I was your wife or that
you was my husband and nobody needs to know it We aint even got
the same names Were strangers fars folks know and we can stay
strangers

Butbut to see each other every day and

Why not Weve seen each other often enough so that the sight wont be
so wonderful And well keep our bein married a secret I shant boast
of it for one

Butbut to SEE each other

Well we neednt see each other much Why we neednt see each other
any unless I have to run over to borrer somethin same as neighbors
have to every once in a while I can guess whats troublin you its
young Brown Youve told him youre a womanhater havent you

Yes I have

Humph Is he one too

The lightkeepers mouth was twisted with a violent emotion He
remembered his view of that afternoons swimming lesson

He said he was he snarled He pretends he is

Mrs Bascom smiled I want to know she said Umph I thought   
However its no matter Perhaps he is Anyhow he can pretend to be and
you can pretend to believe him Thatll be the easiest way I guess Of
course she added I aint tellin you what to do with any idea that
youll do it because I say so The time for that is all past and gone
But it seems to me that for once in my life Id be man enough to stick
it out I wouldnt run away again

Seth did not answer He scowled and stared at the circle of lantern
light on the stone floor Mrs Bascom rose from her seat on the stairs

Well she observed I must be gettin back to the house if I want to
get any sleep tonight I doubt if I get much for a body dont get over
a shock such as Ive had in a minute But Im goin to get over it
and Im goin to stay right here and do my work Im goin to go through
with what seems to be my duty no matter how hard it is Ive done it
afore and Ill do it again Ive promised and I keep my promises Good
night

She started toward the door Her husband sprang from the oil barrel

Hold on he cried you wait a minute Ive got somethin to say

She shook her head I cant wait she said Ive got to go

No you aint neither You can stay a spell longer if you want to

Perhaps but I dont want to

Why not What are you afraid of

Afraid I dont know as Im afraid of anythingthat is with a
contemptuous sniff nothin I see around here

Then what are YOU runnin away for

This was putting the matter in a new light Mrs Bascom regarded her
husband with wrathful amazement which slowly changed to an amused
smile

Oh she said if you think Im runnin away why

I dont see what else tis If I aint scart to have you here I dont
see why you should be scart to stay Set down on them stairs again I
want to talk to you

The lady hesitated an instant and then returned to her former seat Seth
went back to his barrel

Emeline he said Ill stay here on my job

She looked surprised but she nodded

Im glad to hear it she said Im glad youve got that much spunk

Yup well I have I came down here to get clear of everybody women
most of all Now the one woman thatthat

That you specially wanted to get clear of

No No that aint the truth and you know it She set out to get clear
of meand I let her have her way same as I done in everything else

She didnt set out to get clear of you

She did

No she didnt

I say she did

Mrs Bascom rose once more Seth Bascom she declared if all you
wanted me to stay here for is to be one of a pair of katydids hollerin
at each other Im goin Im no bug Im a woman

Emeline you set down Youve hove out a whole lot of hints about my
not bein a man because I run away from your house Do you think Id
have been more of a man if Id stayed in it Stayed there and been
a yaller dog to be kicked out of one corner and into another by you
andand that brotherinlaw of yours Thats all I wasa dog

Humph if a dogs the right breedand big enoughits his own fault
if hes kicked twice

Not if he cares more for his master than he does for himselftaint

Why yes it is He can make his master respect him by provin he aint
the kind of dog to kick And maybe one of his mastershis real master
for he hadnt ought to have but onemight be needin the right kind of
watchdog around the house Might be in trouble herhimself I mean and
be hopin and prayin for the dog to protect herhim I should say And
then the

Emeline what are you talkin about

Oh nothin nothin Seth whats the use of us two settin here at
twelve oclock at night and quarrelin over whats past and settled I
shant do it for one I dont want to quarrel with you

Seth sighed And I dont want to quarrel with you Emeline he agreed
As you say theres no sense in it Dear dear this when you come
to think of it is the queerest thing altogether that ever was in the
world I guess Us two had all creation to roam round in and we landed
at Eastboro TwinLights It seems almost as if Providence done it for
some purpose or other

Yes or the other critter for HIS purposes How did you ever come to
be keeper of a light Seth

WhywhyI dont know I used to be in the service fore I went to
sea much You remember I told you I did And I sort of drifted down
here I didnt care much what became of me and I wanted a lonesome
hole to hide in and this filled the bill Ive been here ever since I
leftleftwhere I used to be But Emeline how did YOU come here You
answered an advertisement you told me but why

Cause I wanted to do somethin to earn my livin I was alone and I
rented my house and boarded But boardin aint much comfort specially
when you board where everybody knows you and knows your story So I

Wait a minute You was alone you say Where waswas HE

He

Yes You know who I mean

He would not speak the hated name His wife spoke it for him

Bennie she asked Oh he aint been with me for most two year now
Hehe went away Hes in New York now And I was alone and I saw Miss
Grahams advertisement for a housekeeper and answered it I needed the
money and

Hold on You needed the money Why you had money

Abner left me a little but it didnt last forever And

You had moren a little I wrote to bank folks there and turned over
my account to you And I sent em a power of attorney turnin over some
stocksyou know what they wasto you too I done that soons I got to
Boston Didnt they tell you

Yes they told me

Well then that ought to have helped along

You dont spose I took it do you

Whywhy not

Why not Do you spose Id use the money that belonged to the husband
that run off and left me I aint that kind of a woman The money and
stocks are at the bank yet I spose anyhow theyre there for all of
me

The lightkeepers mouth opened and stayed open for seconds before he
could use it as a talking machine He could scarcely believe what he had
heard

Butbut I wanted you to have it he gasped I left it for you

Well I didnt take it taint likely with fiery indignation Did
you think I could be bought off like aa meanoh I dont know what

Butbut I left it at the bankfor you Whatwhatll I do with it

I dont know Im sure You might give it to Sarah Ann Christy I
wouldnt wonder if she was less particular than I be

Seths guns were spiked for the moment He felt the blood rush to face
and his fists as he brandished them in the air trembled

IIyouyou he stammered IIyou think I

He knew that his companion would regard his agitation as an evidence of
conscious guilt and this knowledge did not help to calm him He strode
up and down the floor

Look out said Mrs Bascom coldly youll kick over the lantern

Her husband stopped in his stride Darn the lantern he shouted

Sshsh youll wake up the Brown man

This warning was more effective But Seth was still furious

Emeline Bascom he snarled shaking his forefinger in her face
youve said over and over that I want a man You have havent you

She was looking at his shirt cuff then but a few inches from her nose

Who sewed on that button she asked

This was so unexpected that his wrath was for the instant displaced by
astonishment

What he asked What button

That one on your shirt sleeve Who sewed it on

Why I did of course What a crazy question that is

She smiled I guessed you did she said Nobody but a man would sew
a white button on a white shirtor one that was white oncewith black
thread

He looked at the button and then at her His anger returned

You said I want a man didnt you he demanded

Yes I did But Ill have to take part of it back Youre half a man
anyhow that sewin proves it

Huh I want to know Well maybe I aint a man maybe Im only half a
one But I aint a fool I aint a fool

She sighed wearily Well all right she admitted I shant argue
it

You neednt I aintor anyhow I aint an EVERLASTIN fool And nobody
but the everlastinest of all fools would chase Sarah Ann Christy I
didnt That whole business was just one of youryour Bennie Ds lies
You know that too

I know some one lied I heard em They denied seein Sarah Ann and I
saw em with herwith my own eyes I saw em    But there there
she added this is enough of such talk Im goin now

I didnt lie I forgot

All right then you forgot I aint jealous Seth I want even
jealous then Even then I give you a chance and you didnt take ityou
forgot instead Im goin back to the bungalow but afore I go lets
understand this youre to stay here at the lights and I stay where I
am as housekeeper We dont see each other any oftener than we have to
and then only when nobody else is around We wont let my Miss Graham
nor your Brown nor anybody know weve ever met aforeor are meetin
now Is that it

Seth hesitated Yes he said slowly I guess thats it But he
added anxiously II wish youd be specially careful not to let
that young feller whos workin for me know Him and me had aa sort of
agreement andand II

He shant know Goodby

She fumbled with the latch of the heavy door He stepped forward and
opened it for her The night was very dark a heavy fog almost a rain
had drifted in while they were together She didnt seem to notice or
mind the fog or blackness but went out and disappeared beyond the faint
radiance which the lantern cast through the open door She blundered on
and turned the corner of the house then she heard steps behind her

Who is it she whispered in some alarm

Me whispered the lightkeeper gruffly Ill go with you a ways

No of course you wont Im goin alone

Its too dark for you to go alone Youll lose the way

Im goin alone I tell you Go back I dont want you

I know you dont but Im goin Youll fetch up in the cove or
somewheres if you try to navigate this path on your own hook

I shant Im used to findin my own way and Im goin aloneas Ive
had to do for a good while Go back

She stopped short Seth stopped also

Go back she insisted adding scornfully I dont care for your help
at all Im particlar about my company

I aint sullenly Anyhow Im goin to pilot you around the end of
that cove You shant say I let you get into trouble when I might have
kept you out of it

Say Who would I say it to Think Im so proud of this nights cruise
that Ill brag of it WILL you go back

No

They descended the hill Mrs Bascom in advance She could not see the
path but plunged angrily on through the dripping grass and bushes

EmelineEmeline whispered Seth She paid no attention to him They
reached the foot of the slope and suddenly the lady realized that her
shoes already wet were now ankle deep in water And there seemed to be
water amid the long grass all about her

Why What in the world she exclaimed involuntarily What is it

The salt marsh at the end of the cove answered the lightkeeper I
told you youd fetch up in it if you tried to go alone Been tryin to
tell you you was off the track but you wouldnt listen to me

And she would not listen to him now Turning she splashed past him

Hold on he whispered seizing her arm That aint the way

She shook herself from his grasp

WILL you let me be and mind your own business she hissed

No I wont Ive set out to get you home and Ill do it if I have to
carry you

Carry me You You DARE

His answer was to pick her up in his arms She was no light weight and
she fought and wriggled fiercely but Seth was big and strong and he
held her tight She did not scream she was too anxious not to wake
either the substitute assistant or Miss Graham but she made her bearer
all the trouble she could They splashed on for some distance then Seth
set her on her feet and beneath them was dry ground

There he grumbled breathlessly Now I callate you cant miss the
rest of it Theres the bungalow right in front of you

Youyou she gasped chokingly

Ugh grunted her husband and stalked off into the dark




CHAPTER XI

BEHIND THE SAND DUNE


A fog last night wasnt there inquired Brown Breakfast was over
and Seth was preparing for his days sleep

Yes some considerble was the gruff answer then more sharply
Howd you know Twas all gone this mornin

Oh I guessed thats all

Humph Guessed hey You want up in the night was you

No Slept like a top all through

Humph    Well thats good sleeps a good thing Callate Ill
turn in and get a little myself

He moved toward the living room At the door he paused and asked another
question

Howd youerguess there was fog last night he inquired

Oh that was easy everythinggrass and busheswere so wet this
morning Those boots of yours for example pointing to the pair the
lightkeeper had just taken off they look as if you had worn them
wading

His back was toward his superior as he spoke therefore he did not see
the start which the latter gave at this innocent observation nor the
horrified glare at the soaked boots But he could not help noticing the
change in Seths voice

Wawadin repeated Atkins faintly Whats that you say

I said the boots were as wet as if you had been wading Why

Whawhat made you say a fool thing like that How could I go wadin on
top of a lighthouse

I dont know    There there impatiently dont ask any more
questions I didnt say you had been wading and I didnt suppose you
really had I was only joking What IS the matter with you

Nothin    nothin So you was just jokin hey Ha ha Yes yes
wadin up in a lighthouse would be a pretty good joke II didnt see
it at first you know Ha ha I thought you must be off your head
Thought youd been swimmin too much or somethin So long Im goin to
bed

But now it was the helpers turn to start and stammer

Wait he cried Whatwhat did you say about myerswimming was
it

Oh nothin nothin I was just jokin same as you was about the
wadin Ha ha

Ha ha

Both laughed with great heartiness The door shut between them and each
stared doubtfully at his side of it for several moments before turning
away

That forenoon was a dismal one for John Brown His troublesome
conscience stirred by Seths reference to swimming was again in full
working order He tried to stifle its reproaches tried to give his
entire attention to his labors about the lights and in the kitchen but
the consciousness of guilt was too strong He felt mean and traitorous
a Benedict Arnold on a small scale He had certainly treated Atkins
shabbily Atkins the man who trusted him and believed in him whom he
had loftily reproved for spying and then betrayed Yet in a way his
treason so far had been unavoidable He had promisedhad even OFFERED
to teach the Graham girl the side stroke He had not meant to make
such an offer or promise but Fate had tricked him into it and he could
not as a gentleman back out altogether He had been compelled to give
her one lesson But he need not give her another He need not meet her
again He would not He would keep the agreement with Seth and forget
the tenants of the bungalow altogether Good old Atkins Good old Seth
the womanhater How true he was to his creed the creed which he
Brown had so lately professed It was a good creed too Women were at
the bottom of all the worlds troubles They deserved to be hated He
would never never

Well by George he exclaimed aloud

He was looking once more at the lightkeepers big leather boots One of
them was lying on its side and the upturned sole and heel were thickly
coated with blue clay He crossed the room picked up the boots and
examined them Each was smeared with the clay He put them down again
shook his head wandered over to the rockingchair and sat down

Seth had cleaned and greased those boots before he went to bed the day
before Brown had seen him doing it He had put them on after supper
just before going on watch the substitute assistant had seen him do
that also Therefore the clay must have been acquired sometime during
the evening or night just past And certainly there was no clay at the
top of the lighthouse or anywhere in the neighborhood except at
one spotthe salt marsh at the inner end of the cove Seth must have
visited that marsh in the nighttime But why And if he had done so
why did he not mention the fact And now that the helper thought of it
why had he been so agitated at the casual remark concerning wading What
was he up to Now that the Daisy M and story of the wife were no longer
secrets what had Seth Atkins to conceal

Brown thought and guessed and surmised but guesses and surmises were
fruitless He finished his dishwashing and began another of the loathed
housekeeping tasks that of rummaging the pantry and seeing what
eatables were available for his luncheon and the evening meal

He spread the various odds and ends on the kitchen table preparatory to
taking account of stock A part of a slab of bacon a salt codfish some
cold clam fritters a few molasses cookies and half a loaf of bread He
had gotten thus far in the inventory when a shadow darkened the doorway
He turned and saw Mrs Bascom the bungalow housekeeper

Good mornin said Mrs Bascom

Brown answered coldly Why on earth was it always his luck to be present
when these female nuisances made their appearance And why couldnt
they let him alone just as he had determined to let them alonein the
future Of course he was glad that the caller was not Miss Graham but
this one was bad enough

Morning he grunted and took another dish this one containing a
section of dry and ancient cake Seths manufacture from the pantry

What you doin Gettin breakfast this time of day asked the
housekeeper entering the kitchen She had a small bowl in her hand

No replied Brown

Dinner then Pretty early for that aint it

I am not getting either breakfast or dinneror supper madam replied
the helper with emphasis Is there anything I can do for you

Well I dont know but there is I come over hopin you might Hows
the stings

The what

The wasp bites

Theyre all right thank you

Youre welcome Im sure Did you put the cold mud on em same as I
told you to

No    What was it you wanted

Mrs Bascom looked about for a seat The rocker was at the opposite side
of the room and the other chair contained a garment belonging to Mr
Atkins one which that gentleman with characteristic disregard of the
conventionalities had discarded before leaving the kitchen and had
forgotten to take with him The lady picked up the garment looked at
it and sat down in the chair

Your boss is to bed I spose likely she asked

You mean Mr Atkins I suppose likely he is

Um I judged he was bywith a glance at the garment which she still
heldthe looks of things What in the world ARE you doincleanin
house

The young man sighed wearily Yes he said with forced resignation
something of that sort

Seein what there was to eat I guess

You guess right You said you had an errand I think

Did I Well I come to see if I couldnt    Whats that stuff
Cake

She rose picked up a slice of the dry cake broke it between her
fingers smelled of it and replaced it on the plate

Tis cake aint it she observed or it was sometime or other Who
made it You

No

Oh your boss MrerAtkins hey

Yes Considering that there are only two of us here and I didnt make
it it would seem pretty certain that he must have

Yes I guess thats right unless twas some that washed ashore from
Noahs Ark and its too dry for that What on earth are these picking
up one of the molasses cookies stove lids

Brown grinned in spite of his annoyance

Those are supposed to be cookies he admitted

Are they Yes yes Mr Atkins responsible for them

Noo Im afraid those are one of my experiments under Mr Atkinss
directions and orders Im rather proud of those cookies myself

Youd ought to be There there with a smile I guess you think Im
pretty free with my criticism and remarks dont you You must excuse
me Housekeepinspecially the cookin partis my hobby as you might
say and I was interested to see how a couple of men got along with the
job I mustnt set around and keep you from your work You might want to
make some more cookies or somethin

The substitute assistant laughed aloud I wasnt thinking of it he
said but I shall be glad to make the attempt if it would afford you
amusement

Mrs Bascom laughed too I guess youre better natured than I thought
you was she observed It might amuse me some I will admit but I
aint got the time I came to borrow some butter if youve got any to
spare Down here were as far from supplies as the feller that run the
Ark I was mentionin old Noah himself

Brown took the bowl from her hands and went to the pantry to get the
butter When he turned again she was standing by the door one hand
hidden beneath her apron She took the bowl with the other

Much obliged she said Ill fetch this back soons the grocery cart
comes Miss Graham made arrangements to have him drive across every
Saturday Or rather I arranged for it myself Her heads too full of
paintin and scenery to think of much else I tell her you cant eat an
ile paintinunless youre born a goat Goodby

She went away Brown chuckled and went on with his account of stock

Seth turned out rather early that day At half past one he appeared in
the kitchen partially dressed

Where in time is my shirt he demanded impatiently

Your what

My shirt I thought I took it off out here Could have sworn I did
Guess likely I didnt though Must be gettin absentminded

He was on his way back to the bedroom when his helper called

You did take it off out here he cried It was on that chair there I
remember seeing it Probably it has fallen on the floor somewhere

Atkins returned grumbling that the kitchen floor was a healthy place
to heave a shirt

Where is it he asked after a hurried search I cant find it
nowheres Didnt put it in the fire did ye

Of course I didnt I saw it    Why I remember that womans
picking it up when she sat down

Woman What woman

That BaskinBuskinwhatever her name is The housekeeper at the
bungalow

Was sheHERE Seths question was almost a shout His helper stared
at him

Yes he answered she was She came to borrow some butter

Toto borrowbutter

Why yes You didnt think I invited her in for a morning call did
you Dont act as if you had been struck by lightning Its not so very
serious Weve got to expect some trouble of that kind I got rid of her
as soon as I could

Youyou did

Yes I did You should thank me I am on duty during the day and I
suppose most of that sort of thing will fall on me Youre lucky Our
neighbors arent likely to make many calls after dark    Whats the
matter now Why are you looking at me like that

Seth walked to the door and leaned against the post Brown repeated his
question What IS the matter he asked You act just as you did when
I first happened into this forsakthis place If youve got any more
hideous secrets up your sleeve Im going to quit

Secrets Atkins laughed or tried to I aint got any secrets he
declared any more than you have

The latter half of this speech shut off further questioning Brown
turned hastily away and the lightkeeper went into his bedroom and
finished dressing

Find your shirt asked the young man an hour or so later

Hey Yes yes I found it

In your room Thats odd I could have sworn I saw it out here Is that
it youre wearing

Hey No That waswas sort of siled so I put on my other one II
callate Ill go over and work on the Daisy M a spell unless you need
me

I dont need you Go ahead

The time dragged for John Brown after his superiors departure There
was work enough to be done but he did not feel like doing it He
wandered around the house and lights gloomy restless and despondent
Occasionally he glanced at the clock

It was a beautiful afternoon just the afternoon for a swim and he was
debarred from swimming not only that day but for all the summer days
to come No matter what Seths new secret might be it was surely not
connected with the female sex and Brown would be true to the solemn
compact between them He could not bathe in the cove because Miss Graham
would be there

At four oclock he stood in the shadow of the light tower looking across
the cove As he looked he saw Miss Graham in bathing attire emerge
from the bungalow and descend the bluff She did not see him and to
make sure that she might not he dodged back out of sight Then he saw
something else

Out on the dunes back of the barn he caught a glimpse of a figure
darting to cover behind a clump of bushes The figure was a familiar
one but what was it doing there He watched the bushes but they did
not move Then he entered the house went upstairs and cautiously
peered from the back attic window

The bushes remained motionless for some minutes Then they stirred
ever so slightly and above them appeared the head of Seth Atkins Seth
seemed to be watching the cove and the lights For another minute he
peered over the bushes first at the bathing waters below and then at
his own dwelling Brown ground his teeth The lightkeeper was spying
again was watching to see if he violated his contract

But no that could not be for now Seth apparently sure that the coast
was clear emerged from his hiding place and ran in a stooping posture
until he reached another clump further off and nearer the end of the
cove He remained there an instant and then ran still crouching until
he disappeared behind a high dune at the rear of the bungalow And there
he stayed at least Brown did not see him come out

What he did see however was just as astonishing The landward door of
the bungalow opened and Mrs Bascom the housekeeper stepped out into
the yard She seemed to be listening and looking Apparently she must
have heard something for she moved away for some little distance and
stood still Then above the edge of the dune showed Seths head and
arm He beckoned to her She walked briskly across the intervening
space turned the ragged grassgrown corner of the knoll and
disappeared also Brown scarcely believing his eyes waited and
watched but he saw no more Neither Seth nor the housekeeper came out
from behind that dune

But the substitute assistant had seen enoughquite enough Seth Atkins
Seth the womanhater the man who had threatened him with all sorts of
penalties if he ever so much as looked at a female was meeting one of
the sex himself meeting her on the sly What it meant Brown could not
imagine Probably it explained the clay smears on the boots and Seths
discomfiture of the morning but that was immaterial The fact the one
essential fact was this the compact was broken Seth had broken it
Brown was relieved of all responsibility If he wished to swim in that
cove no matter who might be there he was perfectly free to do it And
he would do it by George He had been betrayed scandalously meanly
betrayed and it would serve the betrayer right if he paid him in his
own coin He darted down the attic stairs ran down the path to the
boathouse hurriedly changed his clothes for his bathing suit ran along
the shore of the creek and plunged in

Miss Graham waved a hand to him as he shook the water from his eyes

Over behind the sand dune a more or less interesting interview was
taking place Seth having made sure that his whistles were heard and
his signals seen sank down in the shadow and awaited developments They
were not long in coming A firm footstep crunched the sand and Mrs
Bascom appeared

Well she inquired coldly whats the matter now

Mr Atkins waved an agitated hand

Set down he begged Scooch down out of sight Emeline for the land
sakes Dont stand up there where everybody can see you

The lady refused to scooch

If I aint ashamed of bein seen she observed I dont know why you
should be What are you doin over here anyhow skippin round in the
sand like a hoptoad

The lightkeeper repeated his plea

Do set down Emeline please he urged I thought you and med agreed
that nobodyd ought to see us together

Mrs Bascom gathered her skirts about her and with great deliberation
seated herself upon a hummock

We did have some such bargain she replied Thats why I cant
understand your hidin at my back door and whistlin and wavin like a
young one What did you come here for anyway

Seth answered with righteous indignation

I come for my shirt he declared

Your shirt

Yes my other shirt I left it in the kitchen this mornin and
thatthat helper of mine says you was in the chair along with it

Humph Did he have the impudence to say I took it

Noo No course he didnt But its gone andand

What would I want of your shirt Didnt think I was callatin to wear
it did you

No but

I should hope not I aint a Doctor Mary Walker or whatever her name
is

But you did take it just the same Im sartin you did You must have

The ladys mouth relaxed and there was a twinkle in her eye

All right Seth she said Suppose I did what then

I want it back thats all

You can have it Now what do you spose I took it for

III dont know

You dont know Humph Did you think I wanted to keep it as a souveneer
of last nights doins

Her companion looked rather foolish He picked up a handful of sand and
sifted it through his fingers

Noo he stammered II know how particlar you areyou used to
be about such things and I thought maybe you didnt like the way that
button was sewed on

He glanced up at her with an embarrassed smile which broadened as he
noticed her expression

Well she admitted you guessed right Theres some things I cant
bear to have in my neighborhood and your kind of sewin is one of em
Besides I owed you that much for keepin me out of the wet last night

Oh I judged by the way you lit into me for luggin you acrost that
marsh that all you owed me was a grudge I DID lug you though in spite
of your kickin didnt I

He nodded with grim triumph She smiled

You did thats a fact she said I was pretty mad at the time but
when I come to think it over I felt diffrent Anyhow Ive sewed on
those buttons the way theyd ought to be

Much obliged I guess theyll stay now for a spell You always could
sew on buttons bettern anybody ever I see

Humph    Then after an interval of silence What are you
grinnin to yourself about

Hey    Oh I was just thinkin how you mended up that Rogers
young ones duds when he fell out of our Bartlett pear tree He was the
raggedest mess ever I come acrost when I picked him up Yellin like a
wild thing he was and his clothes half tore off

No wonder he yelled Caught stealin pearshe expected to be thrashed
for thatand he KNEW Melindy Rogers would whip him for tearin his
Sunday suit Poor little thing Least I could do was to make his clothes
whole I always pity a child with a stepmother special when shes
Melindys kind

Whats become of them Rogerses Still livin in the Perry house are
they

No Old Abel Perry turned em out of that when the rent got behind
Hes the meanest skinflint that ever strained skim milk He got married
again a year ago

NO Who was the victim Somebody from the FeebleMinded Home

She gave the name of Mr Perrys bride and before they knew it the
pair were deep in village gossip For many minutes they discussed the
happenings in the Cape Ann hamlet and then Seth was recalled to the
present by a casual glance at his watch

Land he exclaimed Look at the time This talk with you has seemed
soso natural and oldtimey that    Well Ive got to go

He was scrambling to his feet She also attempted to rise but found it
difficult

Here he cried give me your hand Ill help you up

I dont want any help Let me alone Let me ALONE I tell you

His answer was to seize her about the waist and swing her bodily to
her feet She was flushed and embarrassed Then she laughed shortly and
shook her head

What are you laughin at he demanded peering over the knoll to make
sure that neither John Brown nor Miss Graham was in sight

Oh not much she answered You kind of surprise me Seth

Why

Cause youve changed so

Changed How

Oh changed thats all You seem to have more spunk than you used to
have

Humph Think so do you

Yes I do I think bein a lightkeeper must be good for some
folkssome kind of folks

I want to know

Yes you better be careful or youll be a real man some day

His answer was an angry stare and a snort Then he turned on his heel
and was striding off

Wait she called Hold on Dont you want your shirt Stay here and
Ill go into the house and fetch it

He waited sullen and reluctant until she returned with the article of
apparel in one hand and the other concealed beneath her apron

Here it is she said presenting the shirt to him

Thank you he grumbled taking it Much obliged for sewin on the
button

Youre welcome It squares us for your pilotin me over the marsh
thats all Twant any favor I owed it to you

He was turning the shirt over in his hands

Well he began then stopped and looked fixedly at the garment

I see youve mended that hole in the sleeve he said You didnt owe
me that did you

She changed color slightly

Oh she said with a toss of her head thats nothin Just for good
measure I never could abide rags on anybody thatthat I had to look at
whether I wanted to or not

Twas real good of you to mend it Emeline Say he stirred the sand
with his boot you mentioned that you callated Id changed some was
more of a man than I used to be Do you know why

No Unless with sarcasm it was because I want around

It aint that Its because Emeline its because down here Im nigher
bein where I belong than anywheres else but one place That place is at
sea When Im on salt water Im a manyou dont believe it but I am
On land II dont seem to fit in right Keepin a light like this is
next door to bein at sea

Seth I want to ask you a question Why didnt you go to sea when you
ranwhen you left me I sposed of course you had Why didnt you

He looked at her in surprise

Go to sea he repeated Go to SEA How could I Didnt I promise you
Id never go to sea again

Was that the reason

Sartin What else

She did not answer There was an odd expression on her face He turned
to go

Well goodby he said

Goodby ErSeth

Yes what is it

II want to tell you she stammered that I appreciated your leavin
that money and stocks at the bank in my name I couldnt take em of
course but twas good of you I appreciated it

Thats all right

Wait Here Maybe youd like these She took the hand from beneath
her apron and extended it toward him It held a pan heaped with objects
flat brown and deliciously fragrant He looked at the pan and its
contents uncomprehendingly

Whats them he demanded

Theyre molasses cookies Ive been bakin and these are some extry
ones I had left over You can have em if you want em

Whywhy Emeline this is mighty kind of you

Not a mite sharply I baked a good many moren Miss Ruth and I can
dispose of and that poor helper man of yours ought to be glad to get
em after the castiron poundweights that you and he have been tryin
to live on Mercy on us the thoughts of the cookies he showed me this
mornin have stayed in my head ever since Made me feel as if I was
partly responsible for murder

But its kind of you just the same

Rubbish Id do as much for a pig any day There youve got your
shirt now youd better go home

She forced the pan of cookies into his hand and moved off The
lightkeeper hesitated

IIll fetch the pan back tomorrer he called after her in a loud
whisper




CHAPTER XII

THE LETTER AND THE PHONE


The cookies appeared on the table that evening Brown noticed them at
once

When did you bake these he asked

Atkins made no reply so the question was repeated with a variation

Did you bake these this afternoon inquired the substitute assistant

Humph Hey Oh yes I guess so Why Anything the matter with em

Matter with them No Theyre the finest things Ive tasted since I
came here New receipt isnt it

Callate so

I thought it must be Ill take another

He took another and many others thereafter He and his superior cleared
the plate between them

Brown was prepared for questions concerning his occupation of the
afternoon and was ready with some defiant queries of his own But no
occasion arose for either defiance or crossexamination Seth never
hinted at a suspicion nor mentioned the young lady at the bungalow
Brown therefore remained silent concerning what he had seen from the
attic window He would hold that in reserve and if Atkins ever did
accuse him of bad faith or breach of contract he could retort in kind
His conscience was clear nowhe was no more of a traitor than Seth
himselfand this being so he felt delightfully independent If
trouble came he was ready for it and in the meantime he should do as he
pleased

But no trouble came That day and for many days thereafter the
lightkeeper was sweetness itself He and his helper had never been more
anxious to please each other and the house at TwinLights wasto all
appearancesan abode of perfect trust and peace Every day when Seth
was asleep or out of the way working on the Daisy M the assistant
swam to the cove and every day he met Miss Graham there During the
first week he returned from his dips expecting to be confronted by his
superior and ready with counter accusations of his own After this
he ceased to care Seth did not ask a question and was so trustful and
unsuspecting that Brown decided his secret was undiscovered In fact
the lightkeeper was so innocent that the young man felt almost wicked
as if he were deceiving a child He very nearly forgot the meeting
behind the sand dune having other and much more important things to
think of

July passed and the first three weeks of August followed suit The
weather which had been glorious suddenly gave that part of the coast
a surprise party in the form of a three days storm It was an offshore
gale but fierce and the lighthouse buildings rocked in its grasp
Bathing was out of the question and one of Seths dories broke its
anchor rope and went to pieces in the breakers Atkins and Brown slept
but little during the storm both being on duty the greater part of the
time

The fourth day broke clear but the wind had changed to the east and
the barometer threatened more bad weather to come When Seth came in to
breakfast he found his helper sound asleep in a kitchen chair his head
on the table The young man was pretty well worn out Atkins insisted
upon his going to bed for the forenoon

Of course I shant protested Brown Its my watch and you need
sleep yourself

No I dont neither was the decided answer I slept between times
up in the tower off and on You go and turn in Ive got to drive over
to Eastboro by and by and I want you to be wide awake while Im away
We aint done with this spell of weather yet Well have rain and an
easterly blow by night see if we dont You go right straight to bed

I shall do nothing of the sort

Yes you will Im your boss and I order you to do it No back talk
now Go

So Brown went unwilling but very tired He was sound asleep in ten
minutes

Seth busied himself about the house occasionally stepping to the window
to look out at the weather An observer would have noticed that before
leaving the window on each of these occasions his gaze invariably
turned toward the bungalow His thoughts were more constant than his
gaze they never left his little cottage across the cove In fact they
had scarcely left it for the past month He washed the breakfast dishes
set the room in order and was turning once more toward the window when
he heard a footstep approaching the open door He knew the step it was
one with which he had been familiar during other and happier days and
now once moreafter all the years and his savage determination to
forget and to hateit had the power to awaken strange emotions in his
breast Yet his first move was to run into the living room and close his
helpers chamber door When he came back to the kitchen shutting the
livingroom door carefully behind him Mrs Bascom was standing on the
sill She started when she saw him

Land sakes she exclaimed You I callated of course you was abed
and asleep

The lightkeeper waved his hands

Sshh he whispered

What shall I sshh about Your young mans gone somewhere I spose
else you wouldnt be here

No he aint Hes turned in tired out

Oh then I guess Id better go back home Twas him I expected to see
else of course I shouldnt have come

Oh I know that with a sigh Wheres your boss Miss Graham

Shes gone for a walk along shore I came over toto bring back them
eggs I borrowed

Did you Where are they

The housekeeper seemed embarrassed and her plump cheeks reddened

II declare I forgot to bring em after all she stammered

I want to know Thats funny You dont oftenthat is you didnt use
to forget things hardly ever Emeline

Hum you remember a lot dont you

I remember moren you think I do Emeline

Thats enough of that Seth Remember what I told you last time we saw
each other

Oh all right all right I aint rakin up bygones I spose I deserve
all Im gettin

I spose you do Well longs I forgot the eggs I guess I might as well
be trottin back    Youyouve been all rightyou and Mr Brown I
meanfor the last few days while the storm was goin on

Umhm gloomily How about you two over to the bungalow Youve kept
dry and snug I judge

Yes

I didnt know but you might be kind of nervous and scart when twas
blowin All alone so

Humph Ive got used to bein alone As for Miss Ruth I dont think
shes scart of anythin

Well I was sort of nervous about you if you want about yourself
Twas considerble of a gale of wind I thought one spell Id blow out
of the top of the tower

So did I I could see your shadow movin round up there once in a
while What made you come out on the gallery in the worst of it night
afore last

Oh the birds was smashin themselves to pieces against the glass same
as they always do in a storm and I    But say twas after twelve
when I came out Howd you come to see me What was your doin up that
time of night

Mrs Bascoms color deepened She seemed put out by the question

So much racket a body couldnt sleep she explained sharply I
thought the shingles would lift right off the roof

But you want lookin at the shingles You was lookin at the
lighthouses you jest said so Emeline was you lookin for me Was you
worried about me

He bent forward eagerly

Hush she said youll wake up the other womanhater

I dont care I dont care if I wake up all creation Emeline I
believe you was worried about me same as I was about you Moren that
he added conviction and exultation in his tone I dont believe twas
eggs that fetched you here this mornin at all I believe you came to
find out if weif I was all right Didnt you

I didnt come to SEE you be sure of that with emphatic scorn

I know But you was goin to see Brown and find out from him Answer
me Answer me now didnt

She stepped toward the door He extended an arm and held her back

You answer me he commanded

She tried to pass him but his arm was like an iron bar She hesitated a
moment and then laughed nervously

You certainly have took to orderin folks round since the old days
she said Why yes then I did come to find out if you hadnt got
cold or somethin Youre such a child and Im such a softheaded fool
I couldnt help it I callate

Emeline spose I had got cold Spose you found I was sickwhat
then

Whywhy then I guess likely Id have seen the doctor on my way
through Eastboro I shall be goin that way tomorrer when I leave
here

When you leave here What do you mean by that

Just what I say Miss Grahams goin to Boston tomorrer and Im goin
with heras far as the city

Butbut youre comin back

What should I come back here for My summer jobs over If you want
to know my principal reason for comin here this mornin was to say
goodbyto Mr Brown of course

Seths arm dropped He leaned heavily against the doorpost

Youre goin away he exclaimed Youre goin away Where

I dont know Back home I spose Though what Ill do when I get there
I dont know Ive sold the house so I dont exactly know where Ill
put up But I guess Ill find a place

Youve sold your house The house we used to live in

Yes The man thats been hirin it has bought it Im glad for I need
the money So goodby Seth Taint likely well meet again in this
life

She started toward the door once more and this time he was too greatly
disturbed and shaken by what she had told him to detain her At the
threshhold she turned and looked at him

Goodby Seth she said again I hope youll be happy And with
a half smile if I was you Id stay keepin lights it or somethin
else has improved you a whole lot Goodby

Then he sprang forward Emeline he cried Emeline wait You mustnt
go I cant let you go this way I    Whats that

That was the sound of horses feet and the rattle of wheels The
lightkeeper ran to the window

Its Henry Gs grocery cart he said I callate hes fetchin some
truck I ordered last week Do you want him to see you here

I dont care He dont know but what you and me are the best of
friends Yet I dont know Maybe its just as well he dont see me
then therell be no excuse for talk Ill step inside and wait

She returned to the kitchen and Seth went out to meet the wagon Its
driver was the boy who had brought the flypaper and Job

Hello hailed the youngster pulling in his steed how be you Mr
Atkins Ive got some of them things you ordered The rest aint come
from Boston yet Soons they do Henry Gll send em down How you
feelin these days Aint bought no more dogs have you

Seth curtly replied that he want speculatin in dogs to no great
extent any more and took the packages which the boy handed him With
them was a bundle of newspapers and an accumulation of mail matter

I fetched the mail for the bungalow too said the boy Theres two
or three letters for that Graham girl and one for Mrs Bascom Shes
housekeeper there you know

Yes Here you mights well leave their mail along with mine Ill see
its delivered all right

Will you Much obliged Goin to take it over yourself Better look
out hadnt you That Graham girls a peach all the fellers at the
stores talkin about her Seems a pity shes wastin her sassiety on a
womanhater like you thats what they say You aint gettin over your
female hate are you Haw haw

Mr Atkins regarded his questioner with stern disapproval

Theres some thingssuch as chronic sassinesssome folks never get
over he observed caustically Though when green hides are too fresh
they can be tanned dont forget that young feller Any more chatty
remarks youve got to heave over No Well all right then Id be
trottin back home if I was you Henry Gll have to shut up shop if you
deprive him of your valuable services too long Good day to you

The driver somewhat abashed gathered up the reins I didnt mean to
make you mad he observed Anything in our line you want to order

No Im callatin to go to the village myself this afternoon and if I
want any more groceries Ill order em then As for makin me madwell
dont you flatter yourself A moskeeter can pester me but he dont make
me mad but onceand his funerals held right afterwards Now trot along
and keep in the shade much as you can Youre so fresh the sun might
spile you

The boy looking rather foolish laughed and drove out of the yard
Seth his arms full went back to the kitchen He dumped the packages
and newspapers on the table and began sorting the letters

Here you are Emeline he said Heres Miss Grahams mail and
somethin for you

For me The housekeeper was surprised A letter for me What is it I
wonder Somethin about sellin the house maybe

She took the letter from him and turned to the light before opening it
Seth sat down in the rocker and began inspecting his own assortment
of circulars and papers Suddenly he heard a sound from his companion
Glancing up he saw that she was leaning against the doorpost the open
letter in her hand and on her face an expression which caused him to
spring from his chair

What is it Emeline he demanded Any bad news

She scarcely noticed him until he spoke again Then she shook her head

No she said slowly Nothin butbut what I might have expected

But what is it It is bad news Cant I help you Please let me if I
can IId like to

She looked at him strangely and then turned away I guess nobody can
help me she answered Least of all you

Why not Id like to honest I would If its about that house
business maybe I

It aint

Then what is it Please Emeline I know you dont think much of me
Maybe youve got good reasons Im past the place where Id deny that
IIve been feelin meanern meaner every day lately II dont knows

spose you could give me another chance Emeline I

Seth Bascom what do you mean

Lets try it again I will if you will

She was staring at him in good earnest now

Why Seth she exclaimed What are you talkin about Youthe
chronic womanhater

That be blessed I want really a womanhater I only thought I was
Andand I never hated you Right through the worst of it I never did
Lets try it again Emeline Youre in trouble You need somebody to
help you Give me the chance

There was a wistful look in her eyes she seemed or so he thought to
be wavering But she shook her head I was in trouble before Seth
she said and you didnt help me then You run off and left me

You just as much as told me to go You know you did

No I didnt

Well you didnt tell me to stay

It never seemed to me that a husbandif he was a manwould need to be
coaxed to stay by his wife

But dont you care about me at all You used to I know it And I
always cared for you What is it Honest Emeline you never took any
stock in that Sarah Ann Christy doins you know you didnt now did
you

She was close to tears but she smiled in spite of them

Well no Seth she answered I will confess that Sarah Ann never
worried me much

Then DONT you care for me Emeline

I care for you much as I ever did I never stopped carin for you fool
that I am But as for livin with you again and runnin the risk of

You wont run any risk You say Ive improved yourself Your principal
fault with me was as I understand it that I was tootoosomethin
or other That I want man enough By jiminy crimps Ill show you that
Im a man Give me the chance and nothin nor nobody can make me leave
you again Besides theres nobody to come between us now We was all
right until thatthat Bennie D came along He was the one that took
the starch out of me Now hes out of the way HE wont bother us any
more and    Why what is it Emeline

For she was looking at him with an expression even more strange And
again she shook her head

I guess she began and was interrupted by the jingle of the telephone
bell

The instrument was fastened to the kitchen wall and the lightkeeper
hastened to answer the ring

Testin the wire after the storm most likely he explained taking
the receiver from the hook Hello    Hello    Yep this is
Eastboro Lights    Im the lightkeeper yes    Hey    Miss
Graham    Right next door    Yes    WHO Then turning to
his companion he said in an astonished voice Its somebody wants to
talk with you Emeline

With ME Mrs Bascom could hardly believe it Are you sure

So they say Asked me if I could get you to the phone without any
trouble Shes right here now he added speaking into the transmitter
Ill call her

The housekeeper wonderingly took the receiver from his hand

Hello she began Yes this is Mrs Bascom    Who   
What    OH

The last exclamation was almost a gasp but Seth did not hear it As she
stepped forward to the phone she had dropped her letter Atkins went
over and picked it up It lay face downward on the floor and the last
page with the final sentence and signature was uppermost He could
not help seeing it So we shall soon be together as of old Your loving
brother Benjamin

When Mrs Bascom turned away from the phone after a rather protracted
conversation she looked more troubled than ever But Seth was not
looking at her He sat in the rockingchair and did not move nor raise
his head She waited for him to speak but he did not

Well she said with a sigh I guess I must go Goodby Seth

The lightkeeper slowly rose to his feet Emeline he stammered you
aint goin without

He stopped without finishing the sentence She waited a moment and then
finished it for him

Ill answer your question if thats what you mean she said And the
answer is no All things considered I guess thats best

But Emeline II

Goodby Seth

Shant I desperately shant I see you again

I expect to be around here for another day or so But I cant see
anythin to be gained by our meetin Goodby

Taking her letter and those addressed to Miss Graham from the table
she went out of the kitchen Seth followed her as far as the door then
turned and collapsed in the rockingchair




CHAPTER XIII

JOHN BROWN CHANGES HIS NAME


So we shall soon be together again as of old Your loving brother
Benjamin

The sentence which had met his eyes as he picked up the note which
his caller had dropped was still before them burned into his memory
Benjamin Bennie D the loathed and feared and hated Bennie D cause
of all the Bascom matrimonial heartbreaks had written to say that he
and his sisterinlaw were soon to be together as they used to be That
meant that there had been no quarrel but merely a temporary
separation That she and he were still friendly That they had been in
correspondence and that the inventor was coming back to take his
old place as autocrat in the household with all his old influence
over Emeline Seths newfound courage and manhood had vanished at the
thought Bennie Ds name had scarcely been mentioned during the various
interviews between the lightkeeper and his wife She had said her first
husbands brother had been in New York for two years and her manner of
saying it led Seth to imagine a permanent separation following some sort
of disagreement And now and now He remembered Bennie Ds superior
airs his polite sneers his way of turning every trick to his advantage
and of perverting and misrepresenting his Seths most innocent speech
and action into crimes of the first magnitude He remembered the meaning
of those last few months in the Cape Ann homestead All his
fiery determination to be what he had once beenSeth Bascom the
selfrespecting man and husbandcollapsed and vanished He groaned in
abject surrender He could not go through it again he was afraid Of
any other person on earth he would not have been but the unexpected
resurrection of Bennie D made him a hesitating coward Therefore he was
silent when his wife left him and he realized that his opportunity was
gone gone forever

In utter misery and selfhatred he sat with his head in his hands
beside the kitchen table until eleven oclock Then he rose got dinner
and called Brown to eat it He ate nothing himself saying that hed
lost his appetite somehow or other After the meal he harnessed Joshua
to the little wagon and started on his drive to Eastboro Ill be back
early I callate were his last words as he drove out of the yard

After he had gone and Brown had finished clearing away and the
other housekeeping tasks which were now such a burden the substitute
assistant went out to sit on the bench and smoke The threatened
easterly wind had begun to blow and the sky was dark with tumbling
clouds The young man paid little attention to the weather however All
skies were gloomy so far as he was concerned and the darkest day was no
blacker than his thoughts Occasionally he glanced at the bungalow
and on one such occasion was surprised to see a carriage one of the
turnouts supplied by the Eastboro livery stable roll up to its door
and Mrs Bascom the housekeeper emerge climb to the seat beside the
driver and be driven away in the direction of the village He idly
wondered where she was going but was not particularly interested When
a half hour later Ruth Graham left the bungalow and strolled off along
the path at the top of the bluff he was very much interested indeed
He realized as he had been realizing for weeks that he was more
interested in that young woman than in anything else on earth Also
that he had no rightmiserable outcast that he wasto be interested in
her and certainly it would be the wildest insanity to imagine that she
could be interested in him

For what the lightkeeper might say or do in the event of his secret
being discovered he did not care in the least He was long past that
point And for the breaking of their solemn compact he did not care
either Seth might or might not have played the traitor that too was
a matter of no importance Seth himself was of no importance neither
was he There was but one important person in the whole world and she
was strolling along the bluff path at that moment Therefore he left his
seat on the bench hurried down the slope to the inner end of the cove
noting absently that the tide of the previous night must have been
unusually high climbed to the bungalow turned the corner and walked
slowly in the direction of the trim figure in the blue suit which was
walking even more slowly just ahead of him

It may be gathered that John Browns feelings concerning the opposite
sex had changed They had and he had changed in other ways also How
much of a change had taken place he did not himself realize until this
very afternoon He did not realize it even then until after he and the
girl in blue had met and the customary expressions of surprise at their
casual meeting had been exchanged the young lady seated herself on a
dune overlooking the tumbling sea and observed thoughtfully

I shall miss all thiswith a wave of her hand toward the wavesnext
week when I am back again in the city

Browns cap was in his hand as she began to speak After she had
finished he stooped to pick up the cap which had fallen to the ground

You are going awaynext week he said slowly

We are going tomorrow I shall remain in Boston for a few days Then I
shall visit a friend in the Berkshires After that I may join my brother
in Europe Im not sure as to that

Tomorrow

Yes

There was another one of those embarrassing intervals of silence which
of late seemed to occur so often in their conversation Miss Graham as
usual was the first to speak

Mr Brown she began The substitute assistant interrupted her

Please dont call me that he blurted involuntarily Itoh confound
it it isnt my name

She should have been very much surprised He expected her to be Instead
she answered quite calmly

I know it she said

You DO

Yes You are Russ Brooks arent you

Russell Brooks alias John Brown dropped his cap again but did not
pick it up He swallowed hard

How on earth did you know that he asked as soon as he could say
anything

Oh it was simple enough I didnt really know I only guessed You
werent a real lightkeeper that was plain And you werent used to
washing dishes or doing houseworkthat with the irrepressible curl of
the corners of her lips was just as plain When you told me that fib
about meeting my brother here last summer I was sure you had met him
somewhere probably at college So in my next letter to him I described
you as well as I could mentioned that you were as good or a better
swimmer than he and asked for particulars He answered that the
only fellow he could think of who fitted your description was Russ
BrooksRussell I supposeof New York though what Russ Brooks was
doing as lightkeepers assistant at Eastboro TwinLights he DIDNT know
Neither did I But then THAT was not my business

The substitute assistant did not answer he could not on such short
notice

So continued the girl I felt almost as if I had known you for a
long time You and Horace were such good friends at college and he
had often told me of you I was very glad to meet you in real life
especially here where I had no one but Mrs Bascom to talk to Mr
Atkins by reason of his aversion to my unfortunate sex being barred

Mr Brownsor Mr Brooksnext speech harked back to her previous
one

Ill tell you while Im here he began

You neednt unless you wish she said I have no right to
knowadding with characteristic femininity though Im dying to

But I want you to know As I told Atkins when I first came I havent
murdered anyone and I havent stolen anything Im not a crook running
from justice Im just a plain idiot who fell overboard from a steamer
andbitterlyhadnt the good luck to drown

She made no comment and he began his story telling it much as he had
told it to the lightkeeper

There he said in conclusion thats the whole fool business Thats
why Im here No need to ask what you think of it I suppose

She was silent gazing at the breakers He drew his own conclusions from
her silence

I see he said Well I admit it Im a low down chump Still if I
had it to do over again I should do pretty much the same A few things
differently but in general the very same

What would you do differently she asked still without looking at
him

For one thing I wouldnt run away Id stay and face the music Earn
my living or starve

And now youre going to stay here

No longer than I can help If I get the appointment as assistant keeper
Ill begin to save every cent I can Just as soon as I get enough to
warrant risking it Ill head for Boston once more and begin the earning
or starving process And with a snap of his jaws I dont intend to
starve

You wont go back to your father

If he sees fit to beg my pardon and acknowledge that I was rightnot
otherwise And he must do it of his own accord I told him that when I
walked out of his office It was my contribution to our fond farewell
His was that he would see me damned first Possibly he may

She smiled

You must have been a charming pair of pepper pots she observed And
the young ladywhat of her

She knows that I am fired cut off even without the usual shilling
That will be quite sufficient for her I think

How do you know it will How do you know she might not have been
willing to wait while you earned that living you are so sure is coming

Wait She wait for me Ann Davidson wait for a man without a cent while
he tried to earn a good many dollars Humph you amuse me

Why not You didnt give her a chance You calmly took it for granted
that she wanted only money and social position and you walked off and
left her How do you know she wouldnt have liked you better for telling
her just how you felt If a girl really cared for a man it seems to me
that she would be willing to wait for him years and years if it were
necessary provided that during that time he was trying his best for
her

Butbutshe isnt that kind of a girl

How do you know You didnt put her to the test You owed her that It
seems to me you owe it to her now

The answer to this was on his tongue It was ready behind his closed
lips eager to burst forth That he didnt love the Davidson girl never
had loved her That during the past month he had come to realize there
was but one woman in the wide world for him And did that woman mean
what she said about waiting yearsand yearsprovided she cared And
did she care

He didnt utter one word of this He wanted to but it seemed so
preposterous Such an idiotic outrageous thing to ask Yet it is
probable that he would have asked it if the young lady had given him
the chance But she did not after a sidelong glance at his face she
hurriedly rose from the rock and announced that she must be getting back
to the house

I have some packing to do she explained and besides I think it is
going to rain

But Miss Graham I

A big drop of rain splashing upon his shoe confirmed the weather
prophecy She began to walk briskly toward the bungalow and he walked
at her side

Another storm she said I should think the one we have just passed
through was sufficient for a while I hope Mrs Bascom wont get wet

She has gone to the village hasnt she

Yes She has received some message or otherI dont know how it
camewhich sent her off in a hurry A livery carriage came for her She
will be back before night

Atkins has gone too He had some errands I believe I cant make out
what has come over him of late He has changed greatly He used to be so
jolly and goodhumored except when female picnickers came Now he is as
solemn as an owl When he went away he scarcely spoke a word I thought
he seemed to be in trouble but when I asked him he shut me up so
promptly that I didnt press the matter

Did he Thats odd Mrs Bascom seemed to be in trouble too I thought
she had been crying when she came out of her room to go to the carriage
She denied it but her eyes looked red What can be the matter

I dont know

Nor I MrerBrooksOr shall I still call you Brown

No Brown is dead drowned Let him stay so

Very well Mr Brooks has it occurred to you that your Mr Atkins is a
peculiar character That he acts peculiarly

He has acted peculiarly ever since I knew him But to what particular
peculiarity do you refer

His queer behavior Several times I have seen himI am almost sure
it was hehiding or crouching behind the sand hills at the rear of our
bungalow

You have Why I

He hesitated Before he could go on or she continue the rain came in a
deluge They reached the porch just in time

Well Im safe and reasonably dry she panted Im afraid you will be
drenched before you get to the lights Dont you want an umbrella

No No indeed thank you

Well you must hurry then Goodby

But Miss Graham anxiously I shall see you again before you go
Tomorrow at bathing time perhaps

Judging by the outlook just at present bathing will be out of the
question tomorrow

But I want to see you I must

She shook her head doubtfully I dont know she said I shall be
very busy getting ready to leave but perhaps we may meet again

We must IMiss Graham I

She had closed the door He ran homeward through the rain the storm
which soaked him to the skin being but a trifle compared to the tornado
in his breast

He spent the balance of the day somehow he could not have told how The
rain and wind continued six oclock came and Seth should have returned
an hour before but there was no sign of him He wondered if Mrs Bascom
had returned He had not seen the carriage but she might have come
while he was inside the house The lightkeepers nonappearance began to
worry him a trifle

At seven as it was dark he took upon himself the responsibility
of climbing the winding stairs in each tower and lighting the great
lanterns It was the first time he had done it but he knew how and the
duty was successfully accomplished Then as Atkins was still absent and
there was nothing to do but wait he sat in the chair in the kitchen and
thought Occasionally and it showed the trend of his thoughts he
rose and peered from the window across the dark to the bungalow In
the living room of the latter structure a light burned At ten it was
extinguished

At half past ten he went to Seths bedroom found a meager assortment of
pens ink and note paper returned to the kitchen sat down by the table
and began to write

For an hour he thought wrote tore up what he had written and began
again At last the result of his labor read something like this


DEAR MISS GRAHAM

I could not say it this afternoon although if you had stayed I think I
should But I must say it now or it may be too late I cant let you go
without saying it I love you Will you wait for me It may be a very
long wait although God knows I mean to try harder than I have ever
tried for anything in my life If I live I will make something of myself
yet with you as my inspiration You know you said if a girl really
cared for a man she would willingly wait years for him Do you care for
me as much as that With you or for you I believe I can accomplish
anything DO you care

RUSSELL BROOKS


He put this in an envelope sealed and addressed it and without
stopping to put on either cap or raincoat went out in the night

The rain was still falling although not as heavily but the wind was
coming in fierce squalls He descended the path to the cove floundering
through the wet bushes At the foot of the hill he was surprised to find
the salt marsh a sea of water not a vestige of ground above the surface
This was indeed a recordbreaking tide such as he had never known
before He did not pause to reflect upon tides or such trivialities
but with a growl at being obliged to make the long detour he rounded
the end of the cove and climbed up to the door of the bungalow Under
the edge of that door he tucked the note he had written As soon as
this was accomplished he became aware that he had expressed himself very
clumsily He had not written as he might A dozen brilliant thoughts
came to him He must rewrite that note at all hazards

So he spent five frantic minutes trying to coax that envelope from under
the door But in his care to push it far enough it had dropped beyond
the sill and he could not reach it The thing was done for better
or for worse Perfectly certain that it was for worse he splashed
mournfully back to the lights In the lantern room of the righthand
tower he spent the remainder of the night occasionally wandering out on
the gallery to note the weather

The storm was dying out The squalls were less and less frequent and
the rain had been succeeded by a thick fog The breakers pounded in the
dark below him and from afar the foghorns moaned and wailed It was a
bad night a night during which no lightkeeper should be absent from his
post And where was Seth




CHAPTER XIV

BENNIE D


Seths drive to Eastboro was a dismal journey Joshua pounded along over
the wet sand or through ruts filled with water and not once during the
trip was he ordered to Giddap or Show some signs of life Not
until the first scattered houses of the village were reached did the
lightkeeper awaken from his trance sufficiently to notice that the old
horse was limping slightly with the right forefoot

Hello exclaimed Seth Whats the matter with you Josh

Joshua slopped on but this was a sort of threelegged progress The
driver leaned forward and then pulled on the reins

Whoa he ordered Stand still

Joshua stood still almost with enthusiasm Seth tucked the end of the
reins between the whip socket and the dashboard and swung out of
the wagon to make an examination Lifting the lame foot he found the
trouble at once The shoe was loose

Humph he soliloquized Callate you and mell have to give Benijah
a job Well climbing back into the vehicle I said Id never give him
another after the row we had about the last but I aint got ambition
enough to go clear over to the Denboro blacksmiths I dont care I
dont care about nothin any more Giddap

Benijah Elliss little tumbledown blacksmith shop was located in the
main street of Eastboro if that hitormiss town can be said to possess
a main street Atkins drove up to its door before which he found
Benijah and a group of loungers inspecting an automobile the body of
which had been removed in order that the engine and running gear might
be the easier reached The blacksmith was bending over the car his head
and shoulders down amidst the machinery a big wrench was in his hand
and other wrenches hammers and tools of various sizes were scattered
on the ground beside him

Hello Benije grunted Seth

Ellis removed his nose from its close proximity to the gear shaft
and straightened up He was a nearsighted elderly man and wore
spectacles Just now his hands arms and apron were covered with grease
and oil and as he wiped his forehead with the hand not holding the
wrench he left a wide mourning band across it

Well he panted Who is it Who wants me

One of the loafers who had been assisting the blacksmith by holding his
pipe while he dove into the machinery languidly motioned toward the new
arrival Benijah adjusted his spectacles and walked over to the wagon

Who is it he asked crossly Then as he recognized his visitor he
grunted Ugh its you hey Well what do YOU want

Want you to put a new shoe on this horse of mine replied Seth not
too graciously

Is that so Well Im busy

I dont care if you be I guess you aint so busy you cant do a job of
work If you are youre richern I ever heard you was

I want to know Maybe Im particular who I work for Seth Atkins

Maybe you are I aint so particular if I was I wouldnt come here
I tell you that This horse of mines got a loose shoe and I want him
attended to quick

Thought you said youd never trust me with another job

I aint trustin you now Ill be here while its done And I aint
askin you to trust me neither Ill pay cashcash dye understand

The bystanders grinned Mr Elliss frown deepened Im busy he
declared with importance Ive got Mr Delancey Barrys automobile to
fix and I cant stop to bother with horsesspecially certain kind of
horses

This sneer at Joshua roused his owners ire He dropped the reins and
sprang to the ground

See here Benije Ellis he growled advancing upon the repairer of
automobiles who retreated a step or two with promptness I dont care
what youre fixin nor whose it is neither I guess twill be fixed
all right when you get through with it but that aint neither here nor
there And it dont make no difference if it does belong to Mr Barry
If twas Elijahs chariot of fire twould be just the same That auto
wont be done this afternoon and nobody expects it to be Heres my
horse sufferin to be shod I want him shod and Ive got the money to
pay for it When its winter time youre around cryin that you cant
earn money to pay your bills Now just because its summer and theres
city bigbugs in the neighborhood innocent enough to let you tinker with
their autosthough theyll never do it but onceI dont propose to
be put off If you wont shoe this horse of mine Ill know its because
youve got so much money you dont need more And if thats the case
theres a whole lot of folks would be mighty glad to know itHenry G
Goodspeed for one Im goin up to his store now Shall I tell him

This was a shot in the bullseye Mr Ellis owed a number of bills
had owed them for a long time and Mr Goodspeeds was by no means
the smallest The loafers exchanged winks and the blacksmiths manner
became more conciliatory

I didnt say I wouldnt do it for you Seth he pleaded Im always
willin to do your work Youre the one thats been complainin

Ugh Well Im likely to complain some more but the complaints one
thing and the needs another Im like Joel Knowleshe said when he
couldnt get whisky he worried along best he could with bay rum I
need a blacksmith and if I cant get a real one Ill put up with an
imitation Will you shoe this horse for me

Course Ill shoe him But I cant do it this minute Ive got this
consarned machine waving a hand toward the automobile out of door
here and all to pieces And its goin to rain Just let me put enough
of it together sos I can shove it into the shop out of the wet and
then Ill tackle your job You leave your horse and team here and go do
your other errands Hell be ready when you come back

So on this basis the deal was finally made Seth was reluctant to trust
the precious Joshua out of his sight but after some parley he agreed
to do so The traces were unfastened and the animal was led into the
shop the carriage was backed under a shed and the lightkeeper went
away promising to be back in an hour As soon as he had gone Ellis
dived again into the vitals of the auto

The argument with the blacksmith had one satisfactory result so far as
Seth was concerned In a measure it afforded a temporary vent for his
feelings He was moderately agreeable during his brief stay at the
grocery store and when his orders were given and he found the hour not
half over he strolled out to walk about the village And then alone
once more all his misery and heartache returned He strode along his
head down scarcely speaking to acquaintances whom he met until he
reached the railway station where he sat down on the baggage truck to
mentally review over and over again the scene with Emeline and the
dreadful collapse of his newborn hopes and plans

As he sat there the door of the station opened and a man emerged a man
evidently not a native of Eastboro He was dressed in a rather loud but
somewhat shabby suit of summer plaid his straw hat was set a trifle
over one ear and he was smoking the stump of a not too fragrant
cigar Altogether he looked like a sporting character under a temporary
financial cloud but the cloud did not dim his selfsatisfaction nor
shadow his magnificent complaisance He regarded the section of Eastboro
before him with condescending scorn and then catching sight of the
doleful figure on the baggage truck strolled over and addressed it

I say my friend he observed briskly have you a match concealed
about your person If so I

He stopped short for Mr Atkins after one languid glance in his
direction had sprung from the truck and was gazing at him as if he was
some apparition some figure in a nightmare instead of his blase self
And he as he looked at the lightkeepers astounded countenance
dropped the cigar stump from his fingers and stepped backward in alarmed
consternation

YouyouYOU gasped Seth

YOU repeated the stranger

You cried Seth again not a brilliant nor original observation but
under the circumstances excusable for the nonchalant person in
the plaid suit was Emeline Bascoms brotherinlaw the genius the
inventor the one person whom he hatedand fearedmore than anyone
else in the worldBennie D himself

There was a considerable interval during which neither of the pair
spoke Seth openmouthed and horrorstricken was incapable of speech
and the inventors astonishment seemed to be coupled with a certain
nervousness almost as if he feared a physical assault However as the
lightkeeper made no move and his fists remained open the nervousness
disappeared and Bennie D characteristically took command of the
situation

Hum he observed musingly Hum May I ask what you are doing here

Huhhey was Seths incoherent reply

I ask what you are doing here Have you followed me

Folfollered you No

Youre sure of that are you

Yes I be Seth did not ask what Bennie D was doing there Already
that question was settled in his mind The brotherinlaw had found
out that Emeline was living next door to the man she married that her
summer engagement was over and he had come to take her away

Well queried the inventor sharply if you havent followed me what
are you doing here What do you mean by being here

I belong here desperately I work here

You do And may I ask what particular being is fortunate enough to
employ you

Im keeper down to the lighthouses if you want to know But I callate
you know it already

Bennie Ds coolness was not proof against this He started

The lighthouses he repeated Thewhat is it they call themthe
TwinLights

Yes You know it whats the use of askin fool questions

The inventor had not known ituntil that moment and he took time to
consider before making another remark His sisterinlaw was employed as
housekeeper at some bungalow or other situated in close proximity to
the TwinLights that he had discovered since his arrival on the morning
train Prior to that he had known only that she was in Eastboro for
the summer Before that he had not been particularly interested in her
location Since the day two years past when having decided that he
had used her and her rapidly depleting supply of cash as long as was
safe or convenient he had unceremoniously left her and gone to New
York to live upon money supplied by a credulous city gentleman whom his
smooth tongue had interested in his inventions he had not taken the
trouble even to write to Emeline But within the present month the New
Yorkers credulity and his loans had ceased to be material assets
Then Bennie D face to face with the need of funds remembered his
sister and the promise given his dead brother that he should be provided
with a home as long as she had one

He journeyed to Cape Ann and found to his dismay that she was no
longer there After some skillful detective work he learned of the
Eastboro engagement and wrote the lettera piteous appealing letter
full of brotherly love and homesicknesswhich held back by the storm
reached Mrs Bascom only that morning In it he stated that he was
on his way to her and was counting the minutes until they should be
together once more And he had as soon after his arrival in the village
as possible phoned to the Lights and spoken with her Her tone as
she answered was he thought alarmingly cold It had made him
apprehensive and he wondered if his influence over her was on the wane
But nownow he understood Her husbandher husband of all peoplehad
been living next door to her all summer No doubt she knew he was there
when she took the place Perhaps they had met by mutual agreement Why
this was appalling It might mean anything And yet Seth did not
look triumphant or even happy Bennie D resolved to show no signs of
perturbation or doubt but first to find out if he could the truth
and then to act accordingly

Mr Bascom he began The lightkeeper greatly alarmed interrupted
him

Hush he whispered Dont say that That aint my namedown here

Indeed What is your name

Down here they call me Seth Atkins

Bennie D looked puzzled Then his expression changed He was relieved
When he phoned to the Lightsusing the depot phonethe station agent
had seemed to consider his calling a woman over the lighthouse wire
great fun The lightkeeper so the agent said was named Atkins and was
a savage womanhater He would not see a woman much less speak to one
it was a standing joke in the neighborhood Seths hatred of females
That seemed to prove that Emeline and her husband were not reconciled
and living together at least Possibly their being neighbors was merely
a coincidence If so he might not have come too late When he next
addressed his companion it was in a different tone and without the
Mister

BascomorerAtkins he said sharply I hopedI sincerely hoped
that you and I might not meet during my short stay here but as we have
met I think it best that we should understand each other Suppose we
walk over to that clump of trees on the other side of the track
We shall be alone there and I can say what is necessary I dont
wisheven when I remember your behavior toward my sisterto humiliate
you in the town where you may be trying to lead a better life Come

He led the way and Seth yielding as of old to this mans almost
hypnotic command over him and still bewildered by the unexpected
meeting followed like a whipped dog Under the shelter of the trees
they paused

Now then said Bennie D perhaps youll tell me what you mean by
decoying my sister down here in my absence when I was not present to
protect her What do you mean by it

Seth stared at him uncomprehendingly Decoyin her he repeated I
never decoyed her Ive been here ever since I leftleft you and her
that night I never asked her to come I didnt know she was comin And
she didnt know I was here untiluntil a month or so ago I

Bennie D held up a hand He was delighted by this piece of news but he
did not show it

That will do he said I understand all that But since thensince
then What do you mean by trying to influence her as you have Answer
me

The lightkeeper rubbed his forehead

I aint tried to influence her he declared She and me have scarcely
seen each other Nobody knows that we was married not even Miss Graham
nor the young feller thatsthats my helper at the lights You must
know that She must have wrote you What are you talkin about

She had not written he had received no letters from her during the two
years but again the wily genius was equal to the occasion He looked
wise and nodded

Of course he said importantly Of course Certainly

He hesitated not knowing exactly what his next move should be And
Seth having had time to collect in a measure his scattered wits
began to do some thinking on his own account

Say he said suddenly if you knew all this aforehand what are you
askin these questions for

That Bennie Ds gesture was one of lofty disdain is my business

I want to know Well then maybe Ive got some business of my own Who
made my business your business Hey

The welfare of my sister

Never you mind your sister Youre talkin with me now And you aint
got me penned up in a house neither By jiminy crimps His anger
boiled over and to the inventors eyes he began to look alarmingly
alive By jiminy crimps repeated Seth Ive been prayin all these
years to meet you somewheres alone and now Ive a good mind toto

His big fist closed Bennie D stepped backward out of reach

Bascom he cried dont

Dont you call me that

Bascom The inventor was thoroughly frightened and his voice rose
almost to a shout

The lightkeepers wrath vanished at the sound of the name If any native
of Eastboro if the depot master on the other side of the track should
hear him addressed as Bascom the fat would be in the fire for good
and all The secret he had so jealously guarded would be out and all
the miserable story would sooner or later be known

Dont call me Bascom he begged Erplease dont

Bennie Ds courage returned Yet he realized that if a trump card was
to be played it must be then This man was dangerous and somehow
or other his guns must be spiked A brilliant idea occurred to him
Exactly how much of the truth Seth knew he was not sure but he took the
risk

Very well thenAtkins he said contemptuously I am not used to
aliasesnot having dealt with persons finding it necessary to employ
themand I forget But before this disagreeable interview is ended I
wish you to understand thoroughly why I am here I am here to protect my
sister and to remove her from your persecution I am here to assist her
in procuring a divorce

A divorce A DIVORCE Good heavens above

Yes sir triumphantly a divorce from the man she was trapped into
marrying and who deserted her You did desert her you cant deny
that So long as she remains your wife even in name she is liable
to persecution from you She understands this She and I are to see a
lawyer at once That is why I am here

Seth was completely overwhelmed A divorce A case for the papers to
print and all of Ostable county to read

III he stammered and then added weakly I dont believe it
She wouldnt    There aint no lawyer here

Then we shall seek the one nearest here Emeline understands I phoned
her this morning

Was it YOU that phoned

It was NowerAtkins I am disposed to be as considerate of your
welfare as possible I know that any publicity in this matter might
prejudice you in the eyes of yourof the government officials I shall
not seek publicity solely on your account The divorce will be obtained
privately providedPROVIDED you remain out of sight and do not
interfere I warn you therefore not to make trouble or to attempt to
see my sister again If you dowell if you do the consequences will
be unpleasant for you Do you understand

Seth understood or thought he did He groaned and leaned heavily
against a tree trunk

You understand do you repeated Bennie D I see that you do Very
good then I have nothing more to say I advise that you remainerin
seclusion for the next few days Goodby

He gave a farewell glance at the crushed figure leaning against the
tree Then he turned on his heel and walked off

Seth remained where he was for perhaps ten minutes not moving a muscle
Then he seemed to awaken looked anxiously in the direction of the depot
to make sure that no one was watching pulled his cap over his eyes
jammed his hands into his pockets and started to walk across the
fields He had no fixed destination in mind had no idea where he was
going except that he must go somewhere that he could not keep still

He stumbled along through briers and bushes paying no attention to
obstacles such as fences or stone walls until he ran into them when he
climbed over and went blindly on A mile from Eastboro and he was
alone in a grove of scrub pines Here he stopped short struck his hands
together and groaned aloud

I dont believe it I dont believe it

For he was beginning not to believe it At first he had not thought
of doubting Bennie Ds statement concerning the divorce Now as his
thoughts became clearer his doubts grew His wife had not mentioned the
subject in their morning interview Possibly she would not have done
so in any event but as the memory of her behavior and speech became
clearer in his mind it seemed to him that she could not have kept such
a secret She had been kinder had seemed to him moreyes almostwhy
when he asked her to be his again to give him another chance she had
hesitated She had not said no at once she hesitated If she was about
to divorce him would she have acted in such a way It hardly seemed
possible

Then came the letter and the telephone message It was after these that
she had said no with decision Perhaps    was it possible that she
had known of her brotherinlaws coming only then Now that he thought
of it she had not gone away at once after the talk over the phone She
had waited a moment as if for him to speak He staggered and paralyzed
by the sight of his enemys name in that letter had not spoken and
then she    He did not believe she was seeking a divorce It was all
another of Bennie Ds lies

But suppose she was seeking it Or supposefor he knew the persuasive
power of that glib tongue only too wellsuppose her brotherinlaw
should persuade her to do it Should he sit stillin seclusion as his
late adviser had counseledand let this irrevocable and final move
be made After a divorceSeths idea of divorces were vague and
Puritanicalthere would be no hope He and Emeline could never come
together after that And he must give her up and all his hopes of
happiness all that he had dreamed of late would be but dreams never
realities No he could not give them up He would not Publicity
scandal everything he could face but he would not give his wife up
without a fight What should he do

For a long time he paced up and down beneath the pines trying to plan
to come to some decision All that he could think of was to return to
the Lights to go openly to the bungalow see Emeline and make one last
appeal Bennie D might be there but if he waswell by jiminy crimps
let him look out thats all

He had reached this point in his meditations when the wind which had
been steadily increasing and tossing the pinetops warningly suddenly
became a squall which brought with it a flurry of rain He started and
looked up The sky was dark it was late in the afternoon and the storm
he had prophesied had arrived

Half an hour later he ran panting and wet into the blacksmiths shop
The automobile was standing in the middle of the floor and Mr Ellis
was standing beside it perspiring and troubled

Wheres Joshua demanded Seth

Hey inquired the blacksmith absently

Wheres my horse Is he ready

Benijah wiped his forehead

Gosh he exclaimed By    gosh

What are you bgoshin about

SethI dont know what youll say to mebutbut I declare I forgot
all about your horse

You FORGOT about him

Yes You see that thing pointing pathetically at the auto Well
sir that pesky things breakin my heartto say nothin of my back I
got it apart all right no trouble about that And by good rights
Ive got it together again leastways it looks so Yet by time in
distracted agitation theres a half bucket of bolts and nuts and odds
and ends that aint in it yetleft over you might say And I cant
find any place to put one of em Do you wonder I forget trifles

Trifles the shoeing of Joshua a trifle The lightkeeper had been
suffering for an opportunity to blow off steam and the opportunity was
here Benijah withered under the blast

Sshsh shsh he pleaded Land sakes Seth Atkins stop it I dont
blame you for bein mad but you nor nobody else shant talk to me that
way Ill fix your horse in five minutes Yes sir in five minutes
Shut up now or I wont do it at all

He rushed over to the stall in the rear of the shop woke Joshua from
the sweet slumber of old age and led him to the halter beside the
forge The lightkeeper being out of breath had nothing further to say
at the moment

Whats the matter with all you lighthouse folks asked Benijah
anxious to change the subject Whats possessed the whole lot of you to
come to the village at one time Whoa boy stand still

The whole lot of us repeated Seth What do you mean

Mean Ive seen two of you at least this afternoon That Bascom woman
housekeeper at the Graham bungalow she is went past here twice Fust
time she was in one of Snows livery buggies Snows boy drivin her
Then about an hour ago she went by again but the boyd gone and
there was another feller pilotin the teama stranger nobody I ever
see afore

Seths red face turned pale What he cried EmMrs Bascom ridin
with a stranger What sort of a stranger

Oh a feller somewheres between twenty and fifty Smoothfaced critter
with a checked suit and a straw hat    What on earths the matter
with you now

For the lightkeeper was shaking from head to foot

Diddidwhich way was they goin Back to the Lights oror where

No didnt seem to be goin to the Lights at all They went on the
other road Seemed to be headin for Denboro if they kept on as they
started    Seth Atkins have you turned loony

Seth did not answer With a leap he landed at Joshuas head unhooked
the halter and ran out of the shop leading the horse The astonished
blacksmith followed as far as the door Seth was backing the animal into
his wagon which stood beneath the shed He fastened the traces with
trembling fingers

What in the world has struck you shouted Ellis Aint you goin to
have that shoe fixed He cant travel that way Seth Seth Atkins   
By time he IS crazy

Seth did not deny the charge Climbing into the wagon he took up the
reins

Are you sure and sartin twas the Denboro road they took he
demanded

Who took That feller and the Bascom woman Course I am but   
Well I swan

For the lightkeeper waited to hear no more He struck the unsuspecting
Joshua with the end of the reins and with a jump the old horse started
forward Another moment and the lighthouse wagon was splashing and
rattling through the pouring rain along the road leading to Denboro




CHAPTER XV

THE VOYAGE OF THE DAISY M


Denboro is many long miles from Eastboro and the road even in the
best of weather is not a good one It winds and twists and climbs and
descends through woods and over hills There are stretches of marshy
hollows where the yellow clay needs but a little moistening to become a
paste which sticks to wheels and hoofs and makes traveling even behind
a young and spirited horse a disheartening progress

Joshua was neither young nor spirited And the weather could not have
been much worse The three days storm had soaked everything and the
claybottomed puddles were near kin to quicksands As the lighthouse
wagon descended the long slope at the southern end of the village and
began the circle of the inner extremity of Eastboro Back Harbor Seth
realized that his journey was to be a hard one The rain driven by the
northeast wind came off the water in blinding gusts and the waves in
the harbor were tipped with white Also although the tide was almost
at its lowest streaks of seaweed across the road showed where it had
reached that forenoon and prophesied even a greater flood that night
He turned his head and gazed up the harbor to where it narrowed and
became Pounddug Slough In the Slough near its ocean extremity his old
schooner the Daisy M lay stranded He had not visited her for a week
and he wondered if the spell of weather had injured her to any extent
This speculation however was but momentary The Daisy M must look out
for herself His business was to reach Judge Goulds in Denboro before
Mrs Bascom and Bennie D could arrange with that prominent citizen and
legal light for the threatened divorce

That they had started for Judge Goulds he did not doubt for a moment
I shall seek the nearest lawyer Bennie D had said And the judge
was the nearest They must be going there or why should they take
that road Neither did he doubt now that their object was to secure the
divorce How divorces were secured or how long it took to get one Seth
did not know His sole knowledge on that subject was derived from the
newspapers and comic weeklies and he remembered reading of places in
the West where lawyers with the necessary blanks in their pockets met
applicants at the arrival of one train and sent them away rejoicing and
free on the next

 You jump right off the cars and then
 Turn round and jump right on again

This fragment of a song sung at a movingpicture show in the town
hall and resung many times thereafter by Ezra Payne John Browns
predecessor as assistant keeper at the lights recurred to him as he
urged the weary Joshua onward So far as Seth knew the Reno custom
might be universal At any rate he must get to Judge Goulds before
Emeline and her brotherinlaw left there What he should do when he
arrived and found them there was immaterial he must get there that was
all

Eastboro Back Harbor was left behind and the long stretch of woods
beyond was entered Joshua his hoofs swollen by the sticky clay
to yellow cannon balls plodded on but in spite of commands and
pleadingsthe lightkeeper possessed no whip and would not have used one
if he hadhe went slower and slower He was walking now and limping
sadly on the foot where the loose shoe hung by its bent and broken
nails

Five miles six seven and the limp was worse than ever Seth whose
conscience smote him got out of the carriage into the rain and mud
and attempted repairs using a stone as a hammer This seemed to help
matters some but it was almost dark when the granite block marking the
township line was passed and the windows in the houses were alight when
he pulled up at the judges door

The judge himself answered the knock or series of knocks He seemed
much surprised to find the keeper of Eastboro TwinLights standing on
his front step

Why hello Atkins he cried What in the world are you doing over
here a night like this

Hashas Mrs Bascom been here Is she here now panted Seth
anxiously

Mrs Bascom Who is Mrs Bascom

Sheshes a friend of mine She andand a relation of hers was comin
over here to see you on business Aint they here Aint they been
here

No No one has been here this afternoon Ive been in since one
oclock and not a soul has called on business or otherwise

The lightkeeper could scarcely believe it

Youre sure he demanded

Certainly If they came before one my wife would have told me I think
Ill ask her

No no hastily You neednt If they aint been since one they aint
been But I dont understand    Theres no other lawyer nigh here
is there

No none nearer than Bayport

My land My LAND Thenthen Im out of soundins somehow They never
came for it after all

Came for what

Nothin nothin I guess with a sickly smile Ive made some sort
of mistake though I dont know how Benije must have    Ill break
that fellers neck I will

The lawyer began to share the blacksmiths opinion that his caller had
gone crazy

Come in Atkins he urged Come in out of the wet What IS the
matter What are you doing here at this time of night so far from the
Lights Is it anything serious Come in and tell me about it

But Seth instead of accepting the invitation stared at him aghast
Then turning about he leaped down the steps ran to the wagon and
climbed in

Giddap he shouted Poor tired Joshua lifted his claydaubed hoofs

Youre not going back cried Gould Hold on Atkins Wait

But Seth did not wait Already he had turned his horses head toward
Eastboro and was driving off The lawyer stood still amazedly looking
after him Then he went into the house and spent the next quarter of an
hour trying to call the TwinLights by telephone As the northeast wind
had finished what the northwest one had begun and the wire was down
his attempt was unsuccessful He gave it up after a time and sat down to
discuss the astonishing affair with his wife He was worried

But his worriment was as nothing compared to Seths The lawyers
reference to the Lights had driven even matrimonial troubles from the
Atkins mind The lights the TwinLights It was long past the time for
them to be lit and there was no one to light them but Brown a green
hand Were they lit at all If not heaven knew what might happen or had
happened already

He had thought of this before of course had vaguely realized that
he was betraying his trust but then he had not cared The Lights his
position as keeper everything were side issues compared with the one
thing to be done the getting to Denboro He had reached Denboro
and found his journey all a mistake his wife and Bennie D had not
apparently visited that village perhaps had not even started for it
Therefore in a measure relieved he thought of other things He was
many miles from his post of duty and now his sole idea was to get back
to it

At ten oclock Mrs Hepsibah Deacon a widow living in a little house
in the woods on the top of the hill on the Denboro side of Eastboro Back
Harbor with no neighbors for a mile in either direction was awakened
by shouts under her bedroom window Opening that window she thrust forth
her head

Who is it she demanded quaveringly Whats the matter Is anything
afire

From the blackness of the rain and fog emerged a vague shape

Its me Mrs Deacon Seth Atkins down to the Lights you know Ive
left my horse and carriage in your barn Joshhes the horseis
gone lame and played himself out He cant walk another step Ive
unharnessed him and left him in the stall Hell be all right Ive
given him some water and hay Just let him stay there if it aint too
much trouble and Ill send for him tomorrer and pay for his keep Its
all right aint it Much obliged Good night

Before the frightened widow could ask a question or utter a word he was
gone ploughing down the hill in the direction of the Back Harbor When
he reached the foot of that hill where the road should have been he
found that it had disappeared The tide had risen and covered it

It was pitchdark the rain was less heavy and clouds of fog were
drifting in before the wind Seth waded on for a short distance
but soon realized that wading would be an impossibility Then as in
despair he was about ready to give up the attempt a dark object came
into view beside him It was a dory belonging to one of the lobstermen
which at the end of its long anchor rope had swung inshore until
it floated almost over the road Seth seized it in time to prevent
collision with his knees The thole pins were in place and the oars
laid lengthwise on its thwarts As his hands touched the gunwale a new
idea came to him

He had intended walking the rest of the way to Eastboro routing out the
liveryman and hiring a horse and buggy with which to reach the Lights
Now he believed chance had offered him an easier and more direct method
of travel He could row up the Harbor and Slough land close to where
the Daisy M lay and walk the rest of the way in a very short time He
climbed into the dory pulled up the anchor and seated himself at the
oars

The bottom of the boat was two inches deep with rain water and the
thwart was dripping and cold Seth being already about as wet as he
could be did not mind this but pulled with long strokes out into the
harbor The vague black shadows of the land disappeared and in a minute
he was so far as his eyes could tell him afloat on a shoreless sea
He had no compass but this did not trouble him The wind he knew was
blowing directly from the direction he wished to go and he kept the
dorys bow in the teeth of it He rowed on and on The waves out here
in the deep water were of good size and the spray flew as he splashed
into them He knew that he was likely to get off the course but the
Back Harbor was except for its upper entrance landlocked and he could
not go far astray no matter where he might hit the shore

The fog clouds driven by the squalls drifted by and passed At rare
intervals the sky was almost clear After he had rowed for half an hour
and was beginning to think he must be traveling in circles one of
these clear intervals came and far off to the left and ahead he saw
something which caused him to utter an exclamation of joy Two
fiery eyes shone through the dark The fog shut them in again almost
immediately but that one glance was sufficient to show that all was
well at the post he had deserted The fiery eyes were the lanterns in
the TwinLights towers John Brown had been equal to the emergency and
the lamps were lighted

Seths anxiety was relieved but that one glimpse made him even more
eager for home He rowed on for a short time and then began edging in
toward the invisible lefthand shore Judging by the length of time he
had been rowing he must be close to the mouth of the Slough where
winding through the salt marshes it emerged into the Back Harbor

He crept in nearer and nearer but no shore came in sight The fog was
now so thick that he could see not more than ten feet from the boat
but if he was in the mouth of the Slough he should have grounded on the
marsh bank long before The reason that he did not a reason which did
not occur to him at the time was that the marshes were four feet under
water Owing to the tremendous tide Pounddug Slough was now merely a
continuation of the Harbor and almost as wide

The lightkeeper began to think that he must have miscalculated his
distance He could not have rowed as far as he thought Therefore
he again turned the dorys nose into the teeth of the wind and pulled
steadily on At intervals he stopped and listened All he heard was
the moan of distant foghorns and the whistling of the gusts in trees
somewhere at his left There were pine groves scattered all along the
bluffs on the Eastboro side so this did not help him much except to
prove that the shore was not far away He pulled harder on the right
oar Then he stopped once more to listen

Another blast howled through the distant trees and swept down upon him
Then borne on the wind he heard from somewhere ahead and alarmingly
near at hand other sounds voices calls for help

Ahoy he shouted Ahoy there Who is it Where are you

Help came the calls againand nearer Help

Look out roared Seth peering excitedly over his shoulder into the
dark Where are you Look out or youll be afoul of    Jumpin
Judas

For out of the fog loomed a bulky shape driving down upon him He pulled
frantically at the oars but it was too late A mast rocked against the
sky a stubby bowsprit shot over the dory and the little boat struck
broadside on heeled to the waters edge Seth springing frantically
upward seized the bowsprit and clung to it The dory pushed aside and
half full of water disappeared From the deck behind the bowsprit two
voices a mans voice and a womans screamed wildly

Seth did not scream Clinging to the reeling bowsprit he swung up on
it edged his way to the vessels bows and stepped upon the deck

For thunder sakes he roared angrily what kind of navigations this
Wheres your lights you lubbers What dyou mean byWhere are you
anyhow Andand what schooners this

For the deck as much as he could see of it in the dark looked
astonishingly familiar As he stumbled aft it became more familiar
still The ropes a combination of new and old the new boards in the
deck planking the general arrangement of things as familiar to him as
the arrangement of furniture in the kitchen of the Lights It could not
be    but it was The little schooner was his own his hobby his
afternoon workshopthe Daisy M herself The Daisy M which he had
last seen stranded and as he supposed hard and fast aground The Daisy
M afloat after all these years

From the stern by the cabin hatch a man came reeling toward him holding
to the rail for support with one hand and brandishing the other

Help cried the man wildly Who is it Help us were drowning Were
   Cant you put us ashore Please put us    Good Lord

Seth made no answer How could he The man was Bennie D

And then another figure followed the first and a womans voice spoke
pleadingly

Have you got a boat it cried Were adrift on this dreadful thing
and    why SETH

The woman was Emeline Bascom

Why SETH she said again Then the sounds of the wind and waves and
the creaking and cracking of the old schooner alone broke the silence

But Bennie D even under the shock of such a surprise as this did not
remain silent long His precious self was in danger

You put us ashore he shouted You put us ashore right off do you
hear Dont stand there like a fool Do something Do you want us to
drown DO something

Seth came to life His first speech was sharp and businesslike

Emeline he said theres a lantern hanging up in the cabin Go light
it and fetch it to me Hurry

Its upset was the frightened answer Bennie found it when we first
came aboard When wewhen this awful boat started it upset and went
out

Never mind Probably theres ile enough left for a spell Go fetch
it Theres matches in a box on the wall just underneath where twas
hangin Dont stop to talk Move

Mrs Bascom moved Seth turned to the inventor

Come forard with me he ordered Here this way forard FORARD

He seized his companion by the arm and pulled him toward the bow The
frightened genius held back

What in time is the matter with you snarled the lightkeeper Are
your feet asleep Come

Bennie D came under compulsion Seth half led half dragged him to the
bow and bending down uncoiled a rope and put it in his hands

Thems the jib halliards he explained Haul on em quick and hard
as you can If we can hist the jib we can get some steerage way on her
maybe Haul haul till you cant haul no more Then hang on till I come
back and make fast

He rushed back to the wheel The tiller ropes were new and he could
trust them fortunately From the cabin hatchway emerged Mrs Bascom
bearing the lighted lantern

Good snapped Seth Now we can see what were doin and if we show
a glim maybe we wont run down no more dories You go forard andNo
you take this wheel and hold it just as tis JUST as tis understand
Ill be back in a jiffy What in thunders the matter with that foolhead
at the jib

He seized the lantern and rushed to the bow Bennie D had dropped the
halliard and was leaning over the rail screaming for help

Seth hoisted the jib himself made it fast and then turned his
attention to the mutinous hand

Shut up he bellowed catching him by the arm Who do you callates
goin to hear you Shut up You come with me I want you to pump The
old craft would do well enough if she was tight but shes moren likely
takin water like a sieve You come and pump

But Bennie had no notion of pumping With a jerk he tore loose from the
lightkeepers grasp and ran to the stern where he continued his howls
for help

Seth was at his heels

Stop that I tell you he commanded angrily It dont do no good If
you dont want to go to the bottom youll work that pump Dont be such
a clown

The frantic genius paid no attention His sisterinlaw left the wheel
and put her hand on his shoulder Please Bennie she pleaded Please
do as he says He knows and

Bennie D pushed her backward with savage force Mind your own
business he yelled with an oath Twas your foolishness got me into
this Then leaning over the rail he called shrilly Help Im
drowning Help

Mrs Bascom staggered back against the wheel which Seth had seized the
instant she deserted it Oh she said you hurt me

Her husband freed an arm and put it about her Are you much hurt
Emeline he asked sharply

Noo No Seth II guess I aint really hurt at all

Good Then you take this wheel and hold her just so Thats it AND
DONT YOU DROP IT AGAIN Ill attend to this feller

His wiry fingers locked themselves in Bennie Ds shirt collar

I ordered you to pump said Seth Now then you come and pump

Let go screamed his captive Take your hands off me or

The back of his head striking the deck put a period in the middle of
his sentence The next moment he was being dragged by the collar to the
little hand pump amidships

Pump roared the lightkeeper Pump or Ill break your everlastin
neck Lively now

The dazed genius rose to his knees What he stammered Where

Right there in front of you Lively you lubber

A welldirected kick helped to facilitate liveliness

What shall I do wailed Bennie D fumbling the pump brake How does
it go

Up and downso Seth jerked his victims head up and down by way of
illustration Now then he continued you pump till I say quit or
IllI swan to man Ill make a spare topsl out of your hide

He left the inventor working as he had not worked in the memory of man
and strode back to the wheel Mrs Bascom was clinging to the spokes for
dear life

II aint dropped it Seth she declared Truly I aint

All right You can drop it now Ill take it myself You set down and
rest

He took the wheel and she collapsed breathless against the rail After
a time she ventured to ask a question

Seth she said how do you know which way to steer

I dont was the reply All Im tryin to do is keep her afore it If
this notheast wind would hold wed be all right but its dyin fast
And the tide must be at flood if not startin to go out With no wind
and no anchor and the kind of ebb tide therell be pretty soonwell
if we dont drift out to sea well be lucky    Pump pump you son
of a roustabout If I hear you stoppin for a second Ill come forard
and murder you

Bennie D who had ventured to rest for a moment bent his aching back
to the task Was this manslaughtering tyrant his mildmannered meek
brotherinlaw the creature whom he had browbeaten so often and
managed so effectively He could not understandbut he pumped

Perhaps Seth did not understand either perhaps he did not try to
Yet the explanation was simple and natural The sea the emergency the
danger his own deck beneath his feetthese were like old times
here was a situation he knew how to handle He forgot that he was a
lightkeeper absent from duty forgot that one of his passengers was the
wife he had run away from and the other his bugbear the dreaded and
formidable Bennie D He forgot all this and was again the able seaman
the Tartar skipper who in former days made his crews fear respect
and swear by him

And he reveled in his authority Once Mrs Bascom rose to peer over the
rail

Emeline he snapped didnt I tell you to set down and set still
Must I give orders twice SET DOWN

Emeline set

The wind died to fitful gusts The schooner barely moved The fog was
as thick as ever Still Seth did not lose courage When the housekeeper
ventured to murmur that she was certain they would drown he reassured
her

Keep your pennant masthigh Emeline he said cheerfully We aint
out at sea thats sure and sartin And until we get in the breakers
were safe enough The old gal leaks some she aint as dry as a
GoodTemplar prayer meetin but shes afloat And when Im afloat I
aint afraid and you neednt be

Some time after that he asked a question in his turn

Emeline he said what in the world are you doin here on my
schooner

Your schooner Seth Yours Is this dreadfulis this boat yours

Yup Shes mine I bought her just for fun a long spell ago and Ive
been fussin with her ever since But I did it FOR fun I never sposed
shed take a cruiselike this And what are you andhimdoin on
her

Mrs Bascom hesitated It was all an accident Seth she explained
This has been an awful nightand day Bennie and I was out ridin
together and we took the wrong road We got lost and the rain was
awful We got out of the buggy to stand under some trees where twas
drier The horse got scared at some limbs fallin and run off Then it
was most dark and we got down to the shore and saw this boat There
want any water round her then Bennie he climbed aboard and said the
cabin was dry so we went into it to wait for the storm to let up But
it kept gettin worse When we came out of the cabin it was all fog like
this and water everywhere Bennie was afraid to wade for we couldnt
see the shore so we went back into the cabin again And then all at
once there was a bump that knocked us both sprawlin The lantern
went out and when we come on deck we were afloat It was terrible And
thenand then you came Seth and saved our lives

Humph Maybe they aint saved yet    Emeline where was you drivin
to

Why we was drivin home or thought we was

Home

Yes homeback to the bungalow

You was

Yes

A pause Then Emeline theres no use your tellin me what aint so
I know more than you think I do maybe If you was drivin home why did
you take the Denboro road

The Denboro road Why we only went on that a ways Then we turned off
on what we thought was the road to the Lights But it want it must
have been the other the one that goes along by the edge of the
Back Harbor and the Slough the one thats hardly ever used Seth
indignantly what do you mean by sayin that I told you what want so
Do you think I lie

No No more than you thought I lied about that Christy critter

Seth I was always sorry for that I knew you didnt lie At least I
ought to have known you didnt I

Wait What did you take the Denboro road at all for

WhywhyWell Seth Ill tell you Bennie wanted to talk to me
He had come on purpose to see me and he wanted me to do somethin
thatthat    Anyhow hed come to see me I didnt know he was

thisyesterday mornin was from him and it most knocked me over

You hadnt HEARD from him Aint he been writin you right along

No The fact is he left me two years ago without even sayin goodby

roadsos hed have more time to talk I spose

Humph Emeline answer me true Want you goin to Denboro to getto
get a divorce from me

A divorce A divorce from YOU Seth Bascom I never heard such

She rose from her seat against the rail

Set down ordered her husband sharply You set down and keep down

She stared gasped and resumed her seat Seth gazed straight ahead into
the blackness He swallowed once or twice and his hands tightened on
the spokes of the wheel

Thatthat feller there nodding grimly toward the groaning figure at
the pumps told me himself that him and you had agreed to get a divorce
from meto get it right off He give me to understand that you expected
him twas all settled and that was why hed come to Eastboro Thats
what he told me this afternoon on the depot platform

Mrs Bascom again sprang up

Set down commanded Seth

Yes you will Set down And she did

Seth she cried did hedid Bennie tell you that Did he Why I
never heard such aI never Seth it aint true not a word of it Did
you think Id get a divorce Me A selfrespectin woman And from you

promise I give my dyin husband to give his brother a home while I had
one I didnt want to do it I didnt want him with usthere where
wed been so happy But I couldnt say anything I couldnt turn him
out And you wouldnt you

She was interrupted From beneath the Daisy Ms keel came a long
scraping noise The little schooner shook and then lay still The
waves no longer large slapped her sides

Mrs Bascom startled uttered a little scream Bennie D knocked
to his knees roared in fright Seth alone was calm Nothing at that
moment could alarm or even surprise him

Humph he observed were aground somewheres And in the Harbor
Were safe and sound now I callate Emeline go below where its
dry and stay there Dont talkgo As for you leaving the wheel and
striding toward the weary inventor you can stop pumpinunless with
a grim smile you like it too well to quitand set down right where
you be Right where you be I said Dont you move till I say the word
WHEN I say it jump

He went forward lowered the jib and coiled the halliards Then
lantern in hand he seated himself in the bows After a time he filled
his pipe lit it by the aid of the lantern and smoked There was
silence aboard the Daisy M

The wind died away altogether The fog gradually disappeared From
somewhere not far away a church clock struck the hour Seth heard it and
smiled Turning his head he saw in the distance the TwinLights burning
steadily He smiled again

Gradually slowly the morning came The last remnant of lowhanging
mist drifted away Before the bows of the stranded schooner appeared a
flat shore with a road still partially covered by the receding tide
along its border Fish houses and anchored dories became visible Behind
them were hills and over them roofs and trees and steeples

A step sounded behind the watcher in the bows Mrs Bascom was at his
elbow

Why Seth she cried why Seth its Eastboro aint it Were close
to Eastboro

Seth nodded Its Eastboro he said I callated we must be there or
thereabouts With that notheast breeze to help us we couldnt do much
else but fetch up at the inner end of the Back Harbor

She laid her hand timidly on his arm

Seth she whispered what should we have done without you You saved
our lives

He swung about and faced her Emeline he said weve both been
awful fools Ive been the biggest one I guess But Ive learned my
lessonIve swore offI told you Id prove I was a man Do you think
Ive been one tonight

Seth

Well do you Or with a gesture toward the genius who was beginning
to take an interest in his surroundings do you like that kind better

Seth reproachfully I never liked him better If you had

She was interrupted by her brotherinlaw who came swaggering toward
them With the sight of land and safety Bennie Ds courage returned
also his old assurance

Humph he observed Well sister we are safe I really believe
In spite of with a glare at the lightkeeper this persons insane
recklessness and brutality Now I will take you ashore and out of his
presence

Seth rose to his feet

Didnt I tell you he demanded not to move till I said the word
Emeline stay right here

Bennie D stared at the speaker then at his sisterinlaw

Sister he cried in growing alarm sister come come were going
ashore I tell you What are you waiting for

Seth put his arm about the lady

She is goin ashore he said But shes goin with me and shes
goin to stay with me Aint you Emeline

The lady looked up into his face and then down again If you want me
Seth she said

Bennie D sprang forward Emeline he shrieked what do you mean Are

over both lights If you think Im foolin just try and see Now then
Emeline

Seth Atkins Bascomswung over the rail and waded to land




CHAPTER XVI

THE EBB TIDE


John Brown his long nights vigil over extinguished the lights in
the two towers descended the iron stairs and walked across the yard
into the kitchen His first move after entering the house was to
ring the telephone bell and endeavor to call Eastboro He was anxious
concerning Atkins Seth had not returned and the substitute assistant
was certain that some accident must have befallen him The storm had
been severe but it would take more than weather to keep the lightkeeper
from his post if he was all right he would have managed to return
somehow

Brown rang the bell time and time again but got no response The storm
had wrecked the wires that was certain and that means of communication
was cut off He kindled the fire in the range and tried to forget his
anxiety by preparing breakfast When it was prepared he waited a while
and then sat down to a lonely meal But he had no appetite and after
dallying with the food on his plate gave it up and went outside to look
about him

The first thing he looked at was the road from the village No sign of
life in that direction as far as he could see Then he looked at the
bungalow Early as it was a thread of blue smoke was ascending from the
chimney Did that mean that the housekeeper had returned Or had Ruth
Graham been alone all through the miserable night Under ordinary
circumstances he would have gone over and asked if all was well He
would have done that even if Seth were at homehe was past the point
where the lightkeeper or their compact could have prevented himbut he
could not muster courage to go now She must have found the note he
had tucked under the door and he was afraid to hear her answer If it
should be no thenwell then he did not care what became of him

He watched the bungalow for a time hoping that she might come outthat
he might at least see herbut the door did not open Auguring all sorts
of dismal things from this he moped gloomily back to the kitchen He
was tired and had not slept for thirty hours but he felt no desire for
bed He could not go to bed anyway until Atkins returnedand he did not
want to

He sat down in a chair and idly picked up one of a pile of newspapers
lying in the corner They were the New York and Boston papers which the
grocery boy had brought over from Eastboro with the mail the previous
day Seth had not even looked at them and Brown who seldom or never
read newspapers found that he could not do so now He tossed them on
the table and once more went out of doors After another glance at the
bungalow he walked to the edge of the bluff and looked over

He was astonished to see how far the tide had risen in the night The
line of seaweed and drift marking its highest point was well up the
bank Now the ebb was foaming past the end of the wharf He looked for
the lobster car which should have been floating at its moorings but
could not see it Either it was under the wharf or it had been swept
away and was gone And one of the dories was gone too No there it
was across the cove high and dry on the beach If so much damage was
visible from where he stood it was probable that a closer examination
might show even more He reentered the kitchen took the boathouse key
from its nailthe key to Seths wonderful purchase the spring lock
which was to keep out thieves and had so far been of no use except as
a troublemakerand started for the wharf As he passed the table he
picked up the bundle of newspapers and took them with him The boathouse
was the repository for rubbish old papers and magazines included
and these might as well be added to the heap Atkins had not read this
particular lot but the substitute assistant did not think of this

The lobster car was not under the wharf The ropes which had moored
it were broken and the car was gone Splinters and dents in the piles
showed where it had banged and thumped in the grasp of the tide before
breaking loose And lying flat on the wharf and peering under it it
seemed to him that the piles themselves were a trifle aslant that the
whole wharf had settled down on the outer side

He rose and was about to go further out for another examination when
his foot struck the pile of papers he had brought with him He picked
them up and unlocking the boathouse doorit stuck and required
considerable effort to open itentered the building tossed the papers
on the floor and turned to go out Before he could do so the door swung
shut with a bang and a click

At first he did not realize what the click meant Not until he tried to
open it did he understand The settling of the wharf had thrown the door
and its frame out of the perpendicular That was why it stuck and opened
with such reluctance When he opened it he had so to speak pushed it
uphill Its own weight had swung it back and the spring lockin which
he had left the keyhad worked exactly as the circular of directions
declared it would do He was a prisoner in that boathouse

Even then he did not fully grasp the situation He uttered an
exclamation of impatience and tugged at the door but it was heavy
jammed tight in its frame and the lock was new and strong He might as
well have tried to pull up the wharf

After a minute of fruitless effort he gave up the attempt on the door
and moved about the little building seeking other avenues of escape
The only window was a narrow affair high up at the back hung on hinges
and fastened with a hook and staple He climbed up on the fish nets and
empty boxes got the window open and thrust his head and one shoulder
through the opening That however was as far as he could go A dwarf
might have squeezed through that window but not an exvarsity athlete
like Russell Brooks or a husky longshoreman like John Brown It was
at the back facing the mouth of the creek and the sea and afforded
a beautiful marine view but that was all He dropped back on the fish
nets and audibly expressed his opinion of the lock and the man who had
bought it

Then he tried the door again again gave it up and sat down on the fish
nets to think Thinking was unsatisfactory and provoking He gave that
up also and seeing a knothole in one of the boards in the landward
side of his jail knelt and applied his eye to the aperture His only
hope of freedom apparently lay in the arrival home of the lightkeeper
If Seth had arrived he could shout through that knothole and possibly be
heard

The knothole however commanded a view not of the lighthouse
buildings but of the cove and the bungalow The bungalow Ruth Graham
Suddenly and with a shock flashed to his mind the thought that his
imprisonment if at all prolonged was likely to be not a joke but the
most serious catastrophe of his life

For Ruth Graham was going to leave the bungalow and Eastboro that very
day He had begged to see her once more and this day was his last
chance He had written her pleading to see her and receive his answer
If he did not see her if Seth did not return before long and he
remained where he was a prisoner and invisible the last chance was
gone Ruth would believe he had repented of his declaration as embodied
in the fateful note and had fled from her She had intimated that he
was a coward in not seeing his fiancee and telling her the truth She
did not like his writing that other girl and running away Now she
would believe the cowardice was inherent because he had written her
alsoand had run away Horrible

Through the knothole he sent a yell for rescue Another and another
They were unheardat least no one emerged from the bungalow He sprang
to his feet and made another circle of the interior of the boathouse
Then he sank down upon the heap of nets and again tried to think He
must get out He mustsomehow

The morning sunshine streamed through the little window and fell
directly upon the pile of newspapers he had brought from the kitchen and
thrown on the floor His glance chanced to rest for an instant upon the
topmost paper of the pile It was a New York journal which devotes two
of its inside pages to happenings in society When he threw it down
it had unfolded so that one of these pages lay uppermost Absently
scarcely realizing that he was doing so the substitute assistant read
as follows


Engagement in High Life Announced Another American Girl to Wed a
Nobleman Miss Ann Gardner Davidson to become the Baroness Hardacre


With a shout he fell upon his knees seized the paper and read on


Another contemplated matrimonial alliance between one of New Yorks
fairest daughters and a scion of the English nobility was made public
yesterday Miss Ann Gardner Davidson of this city the breaking of
whose engagement to Russell Agnew Brooks son of George Agnew Brooks
the wealthy cotton broker was the sensation of the early spring is to
marry Herbert AinsworthAinsworth Baron Hardacre of Hardacre Towers
Surrey on Kent England It was said that the young lady broke off her
former engagement with Young Brooks because of


The prisoner in the boathouse read no further Ruth Graham had said to
him the day before that in her opinion he had treated Ann Davidson
unfairly He should have gone to her and told her of his quarrel with
his father Although he did not care for Ann she might care for him
Might care enough to wait and    Wait Why she cared so little that
within a few months she was ready to marry another man And if he owed
her any debt of honor no matter how farfetched and fantastic it was
canceled now He was absolutely free And he had been right all the
time He could prove it He would show Ruth Graham that paper and   

His jaw set tight and he rose from the heap of fish nets with the
folded paper clinched like a club in his hand He was going to get out
of that boathouse if he had to butt a hole through its boards with his
head

Once more he climbed to the window and made an attempt to squeeze
through It was futile of course but this time it seemed to him that
the sill and the plank to which it was attached gave a little He put
the paper between his teeth seized the sill with both hands braced
his feet against a beam below and jerked with all his strength
Oncetwicethree times It was giving It was pulling loose He landed
on his back upon the nets sill and a foot of boarding in his hands
In exactly five seconds the folded newspaper jammed in his trousers
pocket he swung through the opening and dropped to the narrow space
between the building and the end of the wharf

The space was a bare six inches wide As he struck his ankle turned
under him he staggered tried wildly to regain his balance and fell
As he fell he caught a glimpse of a blueclad figure at the top of the
bluff before the bungalow Then he went under with a splash and the
eager tide had him in its grasp

When he came to the surface and shook the water from his eyes he was
already some distance from the wharf This an indication of the force
of the tide should have caused him to realize his danger instantly But
it did not His mind was intent upon the accomplishment of one thing
namely the proving to Ruth Graham by means of the item in the paper
that he was no longer under any possible obligation to the Davidson
girl Therefore his sole feeling as he came sputtering to the top of
the water was disgust at his own clumsiness It was when he tried to
turn and swim back to the wharf that he grasped the situation as it was
He could not swim against that tide

There was no time to consider what was best to do The breakers were
only five hundred yards off and if he wished to live he must keep
out of their clutches He began to swim diagonally across the current
putting all his strength into each stroke But for every foot of
progress toward the calmer water he was borne a yard toward the
breakers

The tide bubbled and gurgled about him Miniature whirlpools tugged
at his legs pulling him under He fought nobly setting his teeth and
swearing inwardly that he would make it he would not give up he would
not drown But the edge of the tide rip was a long way off and he was
growing tired already Another whirlpool sucked him down and when he
rose he shouted for help It was an instinctive unreasoning appeal
almost sure to be useless for who could hear himbut he shouted
nevertheless

And the shout was answered From somewhere behind hima long long
distance so it seemed to himcame the clear call in a womans voice

All right Im coming Keep on just as you are

He kept on or tried to He swamand swamand swam He went under
rose went under again fought his way up and kept on swimming Through
the gurgle and hiss of the water sounding dully above the humming in
his ears and the roar of the blood in his tired brain came the clear
voice again

Steady now Just as you are one more stroke Now one more Quick
Quick Now Can you get aboard

The wet red side of a dorys bow pushed past his laboring shoulder
A hand clutched his shirt collar He reached up and grasped the boats
gunwale hung on with all his weight threw one leg over the edge and
tumbled into the dorys bottom

Thanks he panted his eyes shut Thatwasabout the closest call
Iever had Hey Why RUTH

She was panting also but she was not looking at him She was rowing
with all her might and gazing fearfully over her shoulder Are you
strong enough to help me row she asked breathlessly We must head
her away from here out of this tide And Im afraid that I cant do it
alone

He raised his head and looked over the rail The breakers were
alarmingly close He scrambled to the thwart pushed her aside and
seized the oars She resisted

Only one she gasped I can manage the other

So each with an oar they fought the tide and wonbut by the
narrowest of margins The dory edged into stiller and shoaler water
crept out of the eddying channel over the flat where the depth was but
a scant four feet turned almost by inches and at last slid up on the
sandy beach below the bungalow The girl sat bowed over the handle of
her oar her breast heaving She said nothing Her companion likewise
said nothing Staggering he stepped over the side walked a few feet up
the beach and then tumbled in an unconscious heap on the sand

He was not unconscious long being a healthy and robust young fellow
His first thought upon opening his eyes was that he must close them
again as quickly as possible because he wanted the dream to continue
To lie with ones head in the lap of an angel while that angel strokes
your forehead and cries over you and begs you for her sake not to die
is too precious a delusion to lose But the opening of ones eyes is a
mistake under such circumstances and he had made it The angels next
remark was entirely unromantic and practical

Are you better she asked Youre all right now arent you

Her patients reply was also a question and irrelevant

DO you care he asked faintly

Are you better she asked in return

Did you get my note The note I put under the door

Answer me Are you all right again

You answer ME Did you get my note

Yes    Dont try to get up Youre not strong enough yet You must
wait here while I go and get you some

Dont go He almost shouted it Ifif you do IllIllI think Im
going to faint again

Oh no youre not And I must go and get you some brandy or something
Stay just where you are

Ruth Graham if you go away now Ill go with you if I have to crawl
Maybe I cant walk but I swear Ill crawl after you on my hands and
knees unless you answer my question DO you care enough for me to wait

She looked out at the little bay at the narrow wicked tide race at
the breakers beyond Then she looked down again at him

Yes she said    OH are you going to faint again Dont Please
dont

Russell Agnew Brooks the late John Brown opened his eyes I am not
going to faint he observed I was merely trying to realize that I was
fully conscious


Some time after thishours and minutes do not count in paradisehe
remembered the item in the paper

By George he exclaimed I had something to show you Im afraid Ive
lost it Oh no I here it is

He extracted from his trousers pocket the water soaked lump that
had been the New York newspaper The page containing the sensational
announcement of the engagement in high life was quite undecipherable
Being on the outside of the folded paper it had rubbed to a pulpy blur
However he told her about it and she agreed that his judgment of the
character of the future Baroness Hardacre had been absolutely correct

You were very wise she said sagely

Not so wise as Ive become since he asserted with decision Then he
added with a rather rueful smile Im afraid dear people wont say
as much for you when they know

Im satisfied

You may have to wait all those yearsand yearsyou spoke of

I will

But she did not have to For at that moment the miracle of wisdom
beside her sat up and pointed to the wet newspaper lying on the sand at
her feet

Has my happiness affected my wits he demanded Or does salt water
bring on delusions Arent those my initials

He was pointing to a paragraph in the Personals column of the New York
paper This being on one of the inner pages had remained comparatively
dry and could be read The particular Personal to which he pointed was
this


R A B Wherever you are This is to certify that I hereby
acknowledge that you have been absolutely correct in the A D matter
witness news elsewhere I was a fool and I apologize publicly
Incidentally I need a head like yours in my business Come back
Partnership awaiting you Come back and marry anybody or nobody as you
see fit

CHAPTER XVII

WOMANHATERS


But what asked Ruth as they entered the bungalow together has
happened to Mr Atkins do you think You say he went away yesterday
noon and you havent seen him or even heard from him since I should
think he would be afraid to leave the lights for so long a time Has he
ever done it before

No And Im certain he would not have done it this time of his own
accord If he could have gotten back last night he would storm or no
storm

But last night was pretty bad And quite seriously of course he
knew that you were here and so everything would be all right

Oh certainly with sarcasm he would know that of course So long
as I am on deck why come back at all Im afraid Atkins doesnt share
your faith in my transcendent ability dear

Well Miss Graham tossed her head I imagine he knew he could trust
you to attend to his old lighthouses

Perhaps If so his faith has developed wonderfully He never has
trusted me even to light the lanterns No Im afraid something has
happenedsome accident If the telephone was in working order I could
soon find out As it is I can only wait and try not to worry By the
way is your housekeeperMrs Whatshernameall serene after her wet
afternoon When did she return

She hasnt returned I expected her last eveningshe said she would be
back before darkbut she didnt come That didnt trouble me the storm
was so severe that I suppose she stayed in the village overnight

So you were alone all through the gale I wondered if you were I was
tremendously anxious about you And you werent afraid Did you sleep

Not much You see she smiled oddly I received a letter before I
retired and it was such an importantand surprisingcommunication
that I couldnt go to sleep at once

A letter A letter last night WhoWhat You dont mean my letter The
one I put under your door You didnt get THAT last night

Oh yes I did

But how The bungalow was as dark as a tomb There wasnt a light
anywhere I made sure of that before I came over

I know I put the light out but I was sitting by the window in the
dark looking out at the storm Then I saw some one coming up the hill
and it was you

Then you saw me push it under the door

Yes What made you stay on the step so long after you had pushed it
under

Me    Oh hastily I wanted to make sure it waserunder And
you found it and read itthen

Of course I couldnt imagine what it could be and I was curious
naturally

Ruth

I was

Nonsense You knew what it must be Surely you did Now truly didnt
you Didnt you dear

Why should I    Oh your sleeve is wet Youre soaking wet from
head to foot

Well I presume that was to be expected This water out here is
remarkably damp you know and I was in it for some time I should have
been in it yet if it hadnt been for you

Dont with a shudder dont speak of it When I saw you fall into
that tide I    But there you mustnt stay here another moment Go
home and put on dry things Go at once

Dry things be hanged Im going to stay right hereand look at you

Youre not Besides I am wet too And I havent had my breakfast

Havent you Neither have I He forgot that he had attempted to have
one But I dont care he added recklessly Then with a flash of
inspiration Why cant we breakfast together Invite me please

No I shall not At least not until you go back and change your
clothes

To hear is to obey I go but I return as the fellow in the play
observes Ill be back in just fifteen minutes

He was back in twelve and as to make the long detour about the
marshes would he felt then be a wicked waste of time and the marshes
themselves were covered with puddles left by the tide his dry things
were far from dry when he arrived But she did not notice and he was
too happy to care so it was all right They got breakfast together and
if the coffee had boiled too long and the eggs not long enough that was
all right also

They sat at opposite sides of the little table and he needed frequent
reminding that eating was supposed to be the business on hand They
talked of his father and of Ann Davidsonwhom Ruth declared was to be
pitiedof the wonderful coincidence that that particular paper the one
containing the Personal and the Engagement in High Life item should
have been on top of the pile in the boathouse andof other things
Occasionally the talk lapsed and the substitute assistant merely
looked looked and smiled vacuously When this happened Miss Graham
smiled also and blushed Neither of them thought of looking out of the
window

If they had not been so preoccupied if they had looked out of that
window they would have seen a horse and buggy approaching over the
dunes Seth and Mrs Bascom were on the buggy seat and the lightkeeper
was driving with one hand The equipage had been hired at the Eastboro
livery stable Joshua was undergoing repairs and enjoying a muchneeded
rest at the blacksmith shop in the village

As they drew near the lights Seth sighed contentedly

Well Emeline he observed here we be safe and sound Home again
Yes sir by jiminy crimps HOME And you aint goin to Boston today
neither

Mrs Bascom the practical moved toward the edge of the seat

Take your arm away Seth she cautioned Theyll see you

Wholl see me What do I care who sees me Aint a man got a right to
put his arm around his own wife Id like to know

Humph Well all right I can stand it if you can Only I callate your
young Brown man is in for somethin of a shock thats all HE dont
know that Im your wife

Seth removed his arm His expression changed

Thats so he admitted He will be set back three or four rows wont
he

I shouldnt wonder Hell think your womanhate has had a relapse I
guess

The lightkeeper looked troubled then he nodded grimly

His aint what youd call a desprate case he declared Judgin by
what Ive seen in the cove for the last month hes gettin better of
it fast I aint no worse than he is by time    Wonder where he is
This place looks deadern the doleful tombs

He hitched the horse to the back fence and assisted his wife to alight
from the buggy They entered the kitchen No one was there and Seths
hurried search of the other rooms resulted in finding them untenanted
likewise

Maybe hes out in one of the lights he said wait here Emeline and
Ill go see

But she would not wait Im goin right over to the bungalow she
said Im worried about Miss Ruth She was alone all last night and
I shant rest easy till I know nothins happened to her You can come
when you find your young man You and me have got somethin to tell em
and we might as well get the tellin done as soon as possible Nothins
ever gained by putting off a mean job Unless of course she added
looking at him out of the corners of her eyes you want to back out
Seth It aint too late even now you know

He stared at her Back out he repeated back out Emeline Bascom
what are you talkin about You go to that bungalow and go in a hurry
Dont stop to talk go Whos runnin this craft Whos the man in this
familyyou or me

She laughed You seem to be Seth she answered just now

I am Ive been a considerble spell learnin how to be but Ive
learned You trot right along

Brown was in neither of the light towers and Seth began to be worried
about him He descended to the yard and stood there wondering what
on earth could have happened Then looking across the cove he became
aware that his wife was standing on the edge of the bluff making
signals with both hands

He opened his mouth to shout a question but she frantically signaled
for silence Then she beckoned He ran down the path at full speed She
met him at the other side of the cove

Come here she whispered Dont say a word but just comeand look

He followed her crept close to the bungalow window and peeped in His
helper John Brown and Miss Ruth Graham were seated at the table
Also the substitute assistant was leaning across that table with the
young ladys hand in his the pair were entirely oblivious of anything
in the world except each other

A few moments later a thunderous knock shook the bungalow door The
knock was not answered immediately therefore Seth opened the door
himself Miss Graham and the lightkeepers helper were standing some
distance apart they gazed speechlessly at the couple who now entered
the room

Well observed Seth with sarcasm anybody got anything to say
You turning to the young man seems to me you ought to say SOMETHIN
Considerin a little agreement you and me had I should imagine I
was entitled to some triflin explanation What are you doin over
herewith HER Brown

The young gentleman came to himself with a start He walked across to
where Miss Graham was standing and once more took her hand

My name is not Brown he said firmly It is Brooks and this is the
young lady I am to marry

He naturally expected his superior to be surprised As a matter of
fact he was the surprised party Seth reached out drew the bungalow
housekeeper toward him and put his arm about her waist Then he
smiled and the smile was expressive of pride triumph and satisfaction
absolute

ATKINS gasped Brooks

My name aint Atkins was the astonishing reply its Bascom And
this indicating by a tightening of his arm the blushing person at his
side is the lady I married over five year ago


After the stories had been told after both sides had told theirs and
explained and been exclaimed over and congratulated after the very last
question had been asked and answered Brownor Brooksasked one more

But this other fellow he queried this brotherinlawBy George
it is perfectly marvelous this whole businesswhere is he What has
become of him

Seth chuckled Bennie D he said Well Bennie D is leavin
Eastboro on the noon train I paid his fare and give him fifty dollars
to boot Hes goin somewhere but he aint sartin where If you asked
me I should say that in the end hed most likely have to go
where hes never been afore so fars I ever heardthats to work
Nowseein as the important business has been talked over and
settledmaybe youll tell me about the lights and how you got along
last night

But the lighthouse subject was destined to be postponed for a few
minutes The person in whose care the Lights had been left during the
past twenty hours or so looked at the speaker then at the other persons
present and suddenly began to laugh

What are you laughing at asked Miss Graham Why Russell what is
it

Russell Agnew Brooks alias John Brown exsubstitute assistant at
Eastboro TwinLights sank into a chair shaking from head to heel

It is hysterics cried Ruth hastening to his side No wonder poor
dear considering what he has been through Hush Russell dont you
frighten me What IS it

Her fiance waved a reassuring hand Itits all right he gasped
I was just laughing at    Oh pointing an unsteady finger at the
lightkeeper ask him he knows

Ask him repeated the bewildered young lady Why Mr AtkinsBascom
I meanwhat   

And then Seth began to laugh Leaning against the doorpost he at first
chuckled and then roared

Seth cried his wife Seth you old idiot Why I never see two such
