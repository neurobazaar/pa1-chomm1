Original Transcribers Note

This is a mixture of the First and Second editions as noted

The name of the author has been inserted after every title so that it
will be included when poems are copied individually

The footnotes have been renumbered and placed at the bottom of each
individual poem

The sequence of the poems in the second edition has generally been
adhered to and the contents list has been built on this basis The
Indexes have been omitted because of the lack of pagination in etext
Computer searches also make them redundant

Preface

Several anthologies of poems by Yorkshiremen or about Yorkshiremen have
passed through the press since Joseph Ritson published his Yorkshire
Garland in 1786 Most of these have included a number of dialect poems
but I believe that the volume which the reader now holds in his hand is
the first which is made up entirely of poems written in broad
Yorkshire In my choice of poems I have been governed entirely by the
literary quality and popular appeal of the material which lay at my
disposal This anthology has not been compiled for the philologist but
for those who have learnt to speak broad Yorkshire at their mothers
knee and have not wholly unlearnt it at their schoolmasters desk To
such the variety and interest of these poems no less than the
considerable range of time over which their composition extends will I
believe come as a surprise

It is in some ways a misfortune that there is no such thing as a standard
Yorkshire dialect The speech of the North and East Ridings is far
removed from that of the industrial southwest The difference consists
not so much in idiom or vocabulary as in pronunciationespecially in
the pronunciation of the long vowels and diphthongs1 As a consequence
of this I have found it impossible in bringing together dialect poems
from all parts of the county to reduce their forms to what might be
called Standard Yorkshire Had I attempted to do this I should have
destroyed what was most characteristic My purpose throughout has been
to preserve the distinguishing marks of dialect possessed by the poems
but to normalise the spelling of those writers who belong to one and the
same dialect area

The spelling of broad Yorkshire will always be one of the problems
which the dialectwriter has to face At best he can only hope for a
broadly accurate representation of his mode of speech but he can take
comfort in the thought that most of those who read his verses know by
habit how the words should be pronounced far better than he can teach
them by adopting strange phonetic devices A recognition of this fact
has guided me in fixing the text of this anthology and every spelling
device which seemed to me unnecessary or clumsy or pedantic I have
ruthlessly discarded On the other hand where the dialectwriter has
chosen the Standard English spelling of any word I have as a rule not
thought fit to alter its form and spell it as it would be pronounced in
his dialect

I am afraid I may have given offence to those whom I should most of all
like to pleasethe living contributors to this anthologyby
tampering in this way with the text of their poems In defence of what I
have done I must put forward the plea of consistency If I had
preserved every poets text as I found it I should have reduced my
readers to despair

In conclusion I shouldlike to thank the contributors to this volume
and also their publishers for the permission to reproduce copyright
work Special thanks are due to Mr Richard Blakeborough who has placed
Yorkshiremen under a debt by the great service which he has rendered in
recovering much of the traditional poetry of Yorkshire and in giving it
the permanence of the printed page In compiling the socalled
traditional poems at the end of this volume I have largely drawn upon
his Wit Character Folklore and Customs of the North Riding

Preface To the Second Edition

The demand for a second edition of this anthology of Yorkshire dialect
verse gives me an opportunity of correcting two rather serious errors
which crept into the first edition The poem entitled Hunting Song on
page 86 which I attributed to Mr Richard Blakeborough is the work of
Mr MalhamDembleby whose poem A Kuss immediately precedes it in
the volume

The poem on page 75 which in the first edition was marked Anonymous and
entitled Parson Drew thro Pudsey is the work of the late John
Hartley its proper title is T First o t Sooart and it includes
eight introductory stanzas which are now added as Appendix II

Through the kindness of Fr W A Craigie Dr M Denby and Mr E G
Bayford I have also been able to make a few changes in the glossarial
footnotes The most important of these is the change from Embers to
Floor as the meaning of the word Fleet in the second line of A
Lykewake Dirge The note which Dr Craigie sent me on this word is so
interesting that I reproduce it here verbatim

The word fleet in the Lykewake Dirge has been much misunderstood but
it is certain1y the same thing as fletfloor see the OED and EDD
under FLET The form is not necessarily erroneous as is said in the
OED for it might represent the ON dative fleti which must have
been common in the phrase a fleti cf the first verse of Havamal
The collocation with fire occurs in Sir Gawayne l 1653 Aboute
the fyre upon flet Fire and fleet and candlelight are a summary of
the comforts of the house which the dead person still enjoys for this
ae night and then goes out into the dark and cold

INTRODUCTION

The publication of an anthology of Yorkshire dialect poetry seems to
demand a brief introduction in which something shall be said of the
history and general character of that poetry It is hardly necessary to
state that Yorkshire has produced neither a Robert Burns a William
Barnes nor even an Edwin Waugh Its singers are as yet known only among
their own folk the names of John Castillo and Florence Tweddell are
household words among the peasants of the Cleveland dales as are those
of Ben Preston and John Hartley among the artisans of the Aire and Calder
valleys but outside of the county they are almost unknown except to
those who are of Yorkshire descent and who cherish the dialect because of
its association with the homes of their childhood

At the same time there is no body of dialect verse which better deserves
the honour of an anthology In volume and variety the dialect poetry of
Yorkshire surpasses that of all other English counties Moreover when
the rise of the Standard English idiom crushed out our dialect
literature it was the Yorkshire dialect which first reasserted its
claims upon the muse of poetry hence whereas the dialect literature of
most of the English counties dates only from the beginning of the
nineteenth century that of Yorkshire reaches back to the second half of
the seventeenth

In one sense it may be said that Yorkshire dialect poetry dates not from
the seventeenth but from the seventh century and that the first
Yorkshire dialect poet was Caedmon the neatherd of Whitby Abbey But
to the ordinary person the reference to a dialect implies the existence
of a standard mode of speech almost as certainly as odd implies even
Accordingly this is not the place to speak of that great heritage of
song which Yorkshire bequeathed to the nation between the seventh century
and the fifteenth After the Caedmonic poems its chief glories are the
religious lyrics of Richard Rolle the mystic and the great cycles of
scriptural plays which are associated with the tradeguilds of York and
Wakefield But in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the
allconquering Standard English spread like a mighty springtide over
England and found no check to its progress till the Cheviots were
reached The new Kings English was of little avail in silencing
dialect as a means of intercourse between man and man but it checked for
centuries the development of dialect literature The old traditional
ballads and songs which were handed down orally from generation to
generation in the speech of the district to which they belonged escaped
to some extent this movement towards uniformity but the deliberate
artificers of verse showed themselves eager above all things to get rid
of their provincialisms and use only the language of the Court
Shakespeare may introduce a few Warwickshire words into his plays but
his English is none the less the Standard English of his day while
Spenser is sharply brought to task by Ben Jonson for using archaisms and
provincialisms in his poems A notable song of the Elizabethan age is
that entitled York York for my Monie which was first published in
1584 only a Yorkshireman could have written it and it was plainly
intended for the gratification of Yorkshire pride yet its language is
without trace of local colour either in spelling or vocabulary Again
there appeared in the year 1615 a poem by Richard Brathwaite entitled
The Yorkshire Cottoneers and addressed to all truebred Northerne
Sparks of the generous society of the Cottoneers who hold their
Highroade by the Pinder of Wakefield the Shoomaker of Bradford and
the white Coate of Kendall but Brathwaite though a Kendal man by
birth makes no attempt to win the hearts of his truebred Northern
Sparks by addressing them in the dialect that was their daily wear In
a word the use of the Yorkshire dialect for literary purposes died out
early in the Tudor period

As already stated its rebirth dates from the second half of the
seventeenth century That was an age of scientific investigation and
antiquarian research John Ray the father of natural history not
content with his achievements in the classification of plants took up
also the collection of outlandish words and in the year 1674 he
published a work entitled A Collection of English Words not generally
used with their Significations and Original in two Alphabetical
Catalogues the one of such as are proper to the Northern the other to
the Southern Counties Later he entered into correspondence with the
Leeds antiquary Ralph Thoresby who in a letter dated April 27 1703
sends him a list of dialect words current in and about Leeds1

Side by side with this new interest in the dialect vocabulary comes also
the dialect poem One year before the appearance of Rays Collection of
English Words the York printer Stephen Bulkby had issued as a humble
broadside without authors name a poem which bore the following title A
Yorkshire Dialogue in Yorkshire Dialect Between an Awd Wife a Lass and
a Butcher This dialogue occupies the first place in our anthology and
it is from several points of view a significant work It marks the
beginning not only of modern Yorkshire but also of modern English
dialect poetry It appeared just a thousand years after Caedmon had sung
the Creators praise in Whitby Abbey and its dialect is that of
northeast Yorkshirein other words the lineal descendant of that speech
which was used by Caedmon in the seventh century by Richard Rolle in the
fourteenth and which may be heard to this day in the streets of Whitby
and among the hamlets of the Cleveland Hills

The dialogue is a piece of boldest realism Written in an age when
classic restraint and classic elegance were in the ascendant and when
English poets were taking only too readily to heart the warning of
Boileau against allowing shepherds to speak comme on parle au village
the author of this rustic dialogue flings to the winds every convention
of poetic elegance His lines baisent la terre in a way that would
have inexpressibly shocked Boileau and the Parisian salons The poem
reeks of the byre and the shambles its theme is the misadventure which
befalls an ox in its stall and its final despatch by the butchers
mallet One might perhaps find something comparable to it in theme and
treatment in the paintings of the contemporary school of Dutch realists
but in poetry it is unique Yet gross as is its realism it cannot be
called crude as a work of poetic art In rhyme and rhythm it is quite
regular and the impression which it leaves upon the mind is that it was
the work of an educated man keenly interested in the unvarnished life of
a Yorkshire farm keenly interested in the vocabulary and idioms of his
district and determined to produce a poem which should bid defiance to
all the proprieties of the poetic art

Eleven years laterin 1684appeared two more poems in a dialect
akin to but not identical with that of the above and very similar in
theme and treatment These are A Yorkshire Dialogue in its pure Natural
Dialect as it is now commonly spoken in the North Parts of Yorkeshire
and A Scould between Bess and Nell two Yorkshire Women These two poems
were also published at York though by a different printer and in the
following year a second edition appeared followed by a third in 1697 To
the poems is appended Francis Brokesbys Observations on the Dialect and
Pronunciation of Words in the East Riding of Yorkshire which he had
previously sent to Ray1 together with a collection of Yorkshire
proverbs and a Clavis or Glossary also by Brokesby The author of
these two poems who signs himself G M Gent on the titlepage is
generally supposed to be a certain George Meriton an attorney by
profession though Francis Douce the antiquary claims George Morrinton
of Northallerton as the author

G M is a deliberate imitator of the man who wrote the Dialogue
Between an Awd Wife a Lass and a Butcher All that has been said about
the trenchant realism of farmlife in the dialogue of 1673 applies with
equal force to the dialogues of 1684 The later poet having a larger
canvas at his disposal is able to introduce more characters and more
incident but in all that pertains to style and atmosphere he keeps
closely to his model What is still more apparent is that the author is
consciously employing dialect words and idioms with the set purpose of
illustrating what he calls the pure Natural Dialect of Yorkshire above
all he delights in the proverbial lore of his native county and never
misses an opportunity of tagging his conversations with one or other of
these homespun proverbs The poem is too long for our anthology2 but
I cannot forbear quoting some of these proverbs

 Theres neay carrion can kill a craw
 Its a good horse that duz never stumble
 And a good wife that duz never grumble
 Neare is my sarke but nearer is my skin
 Its an illmade bargain whore beath parties rue
 A curst cow hes short horns
 Wilfull fowkes duz never want weay
 For change of pastures macks fat cawves its said
 But change of women macks lean knaves Ise flaid

The excellent example set by the authors of the Yorkshire Dialogues was
not followed all at once Early in the eighteenth century however
Allan Ramsay rendered conspicuous service to dialect poetry generally by
the publication of his pastoral drama The Gentle Shepherd 1725 as
well as by his collections of Scottish songs known as The Evergreen and
Tea Table miscellanies Scotland awoke to song and the charm of Lowland
Scots was recognised even by Pope and the wits of the coffeehouses One
can well believe that lovers of dialect south of the Tweed were thereby
moved to emulation and in the year 1736 Henry Carey the reputed son of
the Marquis of Halifax produced a balladopera bearing the equivocal
title A Wonder or An Honest Yorkshireman3 Popular in its day this
opera is now forgotten but its song An Honest Yorkshireman has found
a place in many collections of Yorkshire songs It lacks the charm of
the same authors famous Sally in our Alley but there is a fine manly
ring about its sentiments and it deserves wider recognition The
dialect is that of northeast Yorkshire

In 1754 appeared the anonymous dialect poem Snaith Marsh4 This is a
much more conventional piece of work than the seventeenth century
dialogues and the use which is made of the local idiom is more
restricted Yet it is not without historic interest Composed at a time
when the Enclosure Acts were robbing the peasant farmer of his rights of
common the poem is an elegiac lament on the part of the Snaith farmer
who sees himself suddenly brought to the brink of ruin by the enclosure
of Snaith Marsh To add to his misery his bride Susan has deserted
him for the more prosperous rival Roger As much of the poem is in
standard English it would be out of place to reprint it in its entirety
in this collection but inasmuch as the author grows bolder in his use
of dialect as the poem proceeds I have chosen the concluding section to
illustrate the quality of the work and the use which is made of dialect

From the date of the publication of Snaith Marsh to the close of the
eighteenth century it is difficult to trace chronologically the progress
of Yorkshire dialect poetry The songs which follow in our anthology
When at Hame wi Dad and Im Yorkshire too appear to have an
eighteenthcentury flavour though they may be a little later Their
theme is somewhat similar to that of Careys song The inexperienced but
canny Yorkshire lad finds himself exposed to the snares and temptations
of  Lunnon city He is dazzled by the spectacular glories of the
capital but his native stock of cannyness renders him proof against
seduction The songs are what we should now call musichall songs and
may possibly have been written for the delights of the visitors to
Ranelagh or Vauxhall Gardens

The Wensleydale Lad seems to be of about the same period for we learn
from the song that the reigning monarch was one of the Georges Its
opening line is a clear repetitionor anticipationof the opening
line of When at Hame wi Dad but whereas the hero of the latter poem
on leaving home seeks out the glories of Piccadilly and Hyde Park the
Wensleydale lad is content with the lesser splendours of Leeds The
broad humour of this song has made it exceedingly popular I first heard
it on the lips of a Runswick fisherman and since then have met with it
in different parts of the county

In the year 1786 Joseph Ritson the antiquary published a slender
collection of short poems which he entitled The Yorkshire Garland This
is the first attempt at an anthology of Yorkshire poetry and the
forerunner of many other anthologies All the poems have a connection
with Yorkshire but none of them can in the strict sense of the word be
called a dialect poem

In the year 1800 the composition of Yorkshire dialect poetry received an
important stimulus through the appearance of a volume entitled Poems on
Several Occasions This was the posthumous work of the Rev Thomas
Browne the son of the vicar of Lastingham The author born at
Lastingham in 1771 started life as a schoolmaster first of all at
Yeddingham and later at Bridlington in the year 1797 he removed to Hull
in order to engage in journalistic work as editor of the recently
established newspaper The Hull Advertiser About the same time he took
orders and married but in the following year he died Most of the poems
in the little volume which his friends put through the press in the year
1800 are written in standard English They display a mind of
considerable refinement but little originality In the form of ode
elegy eclogue or sonnet we have verses which show tender feeling and a
genuine appreciation of nature But the human interest is slight and
the author is unable to escape from the conventional poetic diction of
the eighteenth century Phrases like vocal groves Pomonas rich
bounties or the sylvan choirs responsive notes meet the reader at
every turn direct observation and concrete imagery are sacrificed to
trite abstractions until we feel that the poet becomes a mere echo of
other and greater poets who had gone before him But at the end of the
volume appear the Specimens of the Yorkshire Dialect consisting of
three songs and two eclogues Here convention is swept aside the author
comes face to face with life as he saw it around him in Yorkshire town
and village We have the song of the peasant girl impatiently awaiting
the country fair at which she is to shine in all the glory of new cauf
leather shoon and white stockings or declaring her intention of
escaping from a mother who scaulds and flytes by marrying the
sweetheart who comes courting her on Setterday neets What is
interesting to notice in these songsis the influence of Burns Browne
has caught something of the Scottish poets racy vigour and in his use
of a broken line of refrain in the song Ye loitring minutes faster
flee he is employing a metrical device which Burns had used with great
success in his Holy Fair and Halloween The eclogue Awd Daisy the
theme of which is a Yorkshire farmers lament for his dead mare exhibits
that affection for faithful animals which we meet with in Cowper Burns
and other poets of the Romantic Revival In the sincerity of its emotion
it is poles apart from the studied sentimentality of the famous lament
over the dead ass in Sternes Sentimental Journey indeed in spirit it
is much nearer to Burnss Death of Poor Mailie though Browne is wholly
lacking in that delicate humour which Burns possesses and which
overtakes the tenderness of the poem as the lights and shadows overtake
one another among the hills The other eclogue  The Invasion has
something of a topical interest at a time like the present when England
is once more engaged in war with a continental power for it was written
when the fear of a French invasion of our shores weighed heavily upon the
peoples minds In the eclogue this danger is earnestly discussed by the
two Yorkshire farmers Roger and Willie If the French effect a landing
Willy has decided to send Mally and the bairns away from the farm while
he will sharpen his old lea scythe and remain behind to defend his
homestead As long as wife and children are safe he is prepared to lay
down his life for his country

The importance of Brownes dialect poems consists not only in their
intrinsic worth but also in the interest which they aroused in dialect
poetry in Yorkshire and the stimulus which they gave to poets in
succeeding generations There is no evidence that the dialogues of
George Meriton or Snaith Marsh had any wide circulation among the
Yorkshire peasantry but there is abundant evidence that such was the
case with these five poems of Thomas Browne Early in the nineteenth
century enterprising booksellers at York Northallerton Bedale Otley
and Knaresborough were turning out little chapbooks generally bearing
the title Specimens of the Yorkshire Dialect and consisting largely of
the dialect poems of Browne These circulated widely in the country
districts of Yorkshire and to this day one meets with peasants who take
a delight in reciting Brownes songs and eclogues

Down to the close of the eighteenth century the authors of Yorkshire
dialect poetry had been men of education and even writers by profession
With the coming of the nineteenth century the composition of such poetry
extends to men in a humbler social position The workingman poet
appears on the scene and makes his presence felt in many ways Early in
the century David Lewis a Knaresborough gardener published in one of
the chapbooks to which reference has just been made two dialect poems
The Sweeper and Thieves and An Elegy on the Death of a Frog they
were afterwards republished together with some nondialect verses in a
volume entitled The Landscape and Other Poems York 1815 by the same
author A dialogue poem by Lewis entitled The Pocket Books appears in
later chapbooks It cannot be claimed for him that his poetic power
is of a high standard but as the first Yorkshire peasant poet to write
dialect verse he calls for notice here His Elegy on the Death of a
Frog is perhaps chiefly interesting as showing the influence of Burns
upon Yorkshire poets at the beginning of the nineteenth century In
idea and in the choice of verse it is directly modelled on the famous
To a Mouse

The reader will doubtless have noticed that in this historic review of
Yorkshire dialect poetry it has always been the life of rural Yorkshire
which is depicted and that the great bulk of the poetry has belonged to
the North Riding What we have now to trace is the extension of this
revival of vernacular poetry to the densely populated West Riding where
a dialect differing radically from that of the north and east is spoken
and where an astonishing variety of industries has created an equally
varied outlook upon life and habit of thought Was the Sheffield cutler
the Barnsley miner the Bradford handloomweaver and the Leeds forgeman
to find no outlet in dialect verse for his thoughts and emotions his
hopes and his fears Or if dialect poetry must be concerned only with
rustic life was the Craven dalesman to have no voice in the matter
Questions such as these may well have passed through the minds of West
Riding men as they saw the steady growth of North Riding poetry in the
first forty years of the nineteenth century and passed from hand to hand
the wellthumbed chapbooks wherein were included poems like Awd Daisy
The Sweeper and Thieves and the dialectsongs The desire to have a
share in the movement became more and more urgent and when the West
Riding joined in it was inevitable that it should widen the scope of
dialect poetry both in spirit and in form

A West Riding dialect literature seems to have arisen first of all in
Barnsley and Sheffield in the fourth decade of the nineteenth century
Between 1830 and 1834 a number of prose conversations entitled The
Sheffield Dialect Be a Shevvild Chap passed through the press The
author of these also published in 1832 The Wheelswarf Chronicle and in
1836 appeared the first number of The Shevvild Chaps Annual in which the
writer throws aside his nomdeplume and signs himself Abel Bywater
This annual which lived for about twenty years is the first of the many
Annuals or Almanacs which are the most characteristic product of the
West Riding dialect movement Their history is a subject to itself and
inasmuch as the contributions to them are largely in prose they can only
be referred to very lightly here Their popularity and everincreasing
circulation is a sure proof of their wide appeal and there can be no
doubt that they have done an immense service in endearing the local idiom
in which they are written to those who speak it and also in interpreting
the life and thought of the great industrial communities for whom they
are written The literary quality of these almanacs varies greatly but
among their pages will be found many poems and many prose tales and
sketches which vividly portray the West Riding artisan Abundant
justice is done to his sense of humour which if broad and at times even
crude is always goodnatured and healthy as well as to his intense love
of the sentimental which to the stranger lurks hidden beneath a mask of
indifference Incidentally these almanacs also present a faithful
picture of the social history of the West Riding during the greater part
of a century As we study their pages we realise what impression events
such as the introduction of the railroad the Chartist Movement the
Repeal of the Corn Laws midVictorian factory legislation Trade
Unionism the Cooperative movement and Temperance reform made upon the
minds of nineteenthcentury Yorkshiremen in other words these almanacs
furnish us with just such a mirror of nineteenthcentury industrial
Yorkshire as the bound volumes of Punch furnish of the nation as a
whole Among the most famous of these annual productions is The Bairnsla
Foaks Annual an Pogmoor Olmenack started by Charles Rogers Tom
Treddlehoyle in 1838 and The Halifax Original Illuminated Clock Almanac
begun by John Hartley in 1867 The number of these almanacs is very
large most of them are published and circulated chiefly in the
industrial districts of the Riding but not the least interesting among
them is The Nidderdill Olminac edited by Nattie Nidds at Pateley
Bridge it began in 1864 and ran until 1880 Wherever published all of
these almanacs conform more or less to the same pattern as it was first
laid down by the founder of the dialect almanac Abel Bywater of
Sheffield in the year 1836 Widely popular in the West Riding the
almanac has never obtained foothold in the other Ridings and is little
known outside of the county The Bibliographical List of dialect
literature published by the English Dialect Society in 1877 mentions
only two annuals or almanacs in addition to those published in the West
Riding and both of these belong to Tyneside

Abel Bywater finds a place in our anthology by virtue of his Sheffield
Cutlers Song In its rollicking swing and boisterous humour it serves
admirably to illustrate the new note which is heard when we pass from
rural Yorkshire to the noisy manufacturing cities We exchange the farm
or the country fair for the gallery of the city musichall where the
cutler sits armed with stones red herrings flatbacks and other
missiles ready to be hurled at the performers if they dont play
Nancys Fancy or onay tune we fix

We are not concerned here with the linguistic side of Yorkshire dialect
literature but the reader will notice how different is the phonology
and to a less extent the vocabulary and idiom of this song from that of
the North Riding specimens

Returning once more to the North Riding we must first of all draw
attention to the poet John Castillo In the country round Whitby and
Pickering and throughout the Hambledon Hills his name is very familiar
Born near Dublin in 1792 of Roman Catholic parents he was brought up
at Lealholm Bridge in the Cleveland country and learnt the trade of a
journeyman stonemason Having abjured the faith of his childhood he
joined in 1818 the Wesleyan Methodist Society and acquired great
popularity in the North Riding as a local preacher His wellknown poem
Awd Isaac seems to have been first printed at Northallerton in 1831
Twelve years later it occupies the first place in a volume of poems
published by the author at Whitby under the title Awd Isaac The
Steeplechase and Other Poems Like most of his other poems Awd Isaac
is strongly didactic and religious its homely piety and directness of
speach have won for it a warm welcome among the North Yorkshire
peasantry and many a farmer and farmlabourer still living knows much of
the poem by heart As Awd Isaac  is too long for an anthology I have
chosen The Lucky Dream as an illustration of Castillos workmanship
Apart from its narrative interest this poem calls for attention as a
Yorkshire variant of an ancient and widely dispersed folktale the
earliest known version of which is to be found in the works of the
thirteenthcentury Persian poet JalaludDin Castillo died at Pickering
in 1845 and five years later a complete edition of his poems was
published at Kirkby Moorside

Less popular than Awd Isaac but often met with in collections of
dialect verse is the poem entitled The York Minster Screen This was
the work of George Newton Brown a lawyer by profession who lived at
Nunnington in Ryedale The poem which is in the form of a dialogue
between two Yorkshire farmers was first published at Malton in 1833
The conversation which is of the raciest description is supposed to
take place in York Minster and turns on the repairs which were made in
1832 to the famous organscreen which separates the nave and transepts
from the chancel The question of altering the position of the screen is
debated with much humour and vivacity

Before leaving the North Riding reference must be made to Elizabeth
Tweddell the gifted poetess of the Cleveland Hills Born at Stokesley
in 1833 the daughter of Thomas Cole the parishclerk of that town she
married George Markham Tweddell the author of The Peoples History of
Cleveland and in 1875 she published a slender volume of dialect verse
and prose entitled Rhymes and Sketches to Illustrate the Cleveland
Dialect In her modest preface Mrs Tweddell declares that the only
merit of her work lies in the stringing together of a good many
Cleveland words and expressions that are fast becoming obsolete but the
volume has far deeper claims on our gratitude than this There is much
homely charm in her rhymes and sketches and the two extracts which find
a place in this collection are models of what simple dialectpoems should
be Above all Mrs Tweddell has the gift of humour this is well
illustrated by the song Deant mak gam o me and also by her
wellknown prose story Awd Gab o Steers Her most sustained effort in
verse is the poem entitled  T Awd Cleveland Customs in which she
gives us a delightful picture of the festive seasons of the Cleveland
year from  Newery Day with its lucky bod to Kessamus with its
sooard dancers

The western portion of the North Riding including Swale and Wensleydale
has been less fruitful in dialect poetry than the eastern Apart from
the anonymous Wensleydale Lad already noticed it is represented in
this anthology only by the spirited poem Reeth Bartle Fair the work
of a true lover of dialect speech Captain John Harland who published
for the English Dialect Society a valuable glossary of Swaledale words
1873 The Craven country the dialect of which differs materially from
that spoken in the manufacturing districts of the West Riding is not
without its bards These include James Henry Dixon 18031876a
local historian and antiquary of scholarly tastes who edited for the
Percy Society the delightful collection of folkpoetry entitled Ancient
Poems Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England 1846 Mr Dixon
wrote comparatively little poetry himself but his song The
Milkintime has the lilt of the best Scottish folksongs and well
deserves its inclusion here In a longer poem Slaadburn Faar 1871
he gives a humorous and racy description of the adventures of a farmer
and his wife on their journey from Grassington to Slaidburn to attend the
local fair In general idea it resembles Harlands Reeth Bartle Fair
which appeared in the preceding year

But the typical poet of the Craven country was Tom Twistleton a farmer
near Settle whose Poems in the Craven Dialect first appeared in 1869
and soon ran through several editions He was a disciple of Burns and
his poem The ChristmasParty see below daringly challenges comparison
with the immortal Halloween His description of the dancing in the
farmhouse kitchen and of the adventures of the pair of lovers who
escape from the merry throng is singularly vivid and illustrates the
authors ready humour and keen observation of rustic life and character

Reference has already been made to the Nidderdill Olminac which vas
produced by Nattie Nidds between 1864 and 1880 and published at Pateley
Bridge Among the contributors to it was Thomas Blackah a working miner
of Greenhow Hill who in 1867 published a volume of dialect verse
entitled Songs and Poems in the Nidderdale Dialect In their truth to
life homely charm and freedom from pretentiousness these dialect poems
resemble those of Mrs Tweddell and deserve a wider recognition than
they have so far won

After this excursion into the dales of the North and West Riding where
apart from mining the life of the people is largely spent on the farm
we must turn once again to the industrial Yorkshire of the southwest
and see to what extent dialect poetry has flourished in the smokeladen
air of chimneystacks and blastfurnaces and with what success the
Yorkshire dialect poets of the towns and cities have interpreted the life
and thoughts of those who work in the mill or at the forge As we have
already seen the first attempts to interpret in dialect poetry the life
of industrial Yorkshire were made at Sheffield early in the nineteenth
century by Abel Bywater As the century advanced the movement spread
northwards and the great artisan communities of Bradford Leeds and
Halifax produced their poets Among these preeminence belongs to Ben
Preston the Bradford poet who stepped swiftly into local fame by the
publication of his wellknown poem Natterin Nan which first appeared
in a Bradford journal in 1856 This is a vigorous piece of dramatic
realism setting forth the character of a Yorkshire scold and grumbler
with infinite zest and humour But it is in pathos that the genius of
Preston chiefly consists In poems like Owd Moxy T Lancashire
Famine and I niver can call her my wife he gives us pictures of the
struggle that went on in the cottagehomes of the West Riding during the
hungry forties In Owd Moxy his subject is the old waller who has to
face the pitiless winter wind and rain as he plies his dreary task on the
moors but in most of his poems it is the life of the handloomweaver
that he interprets The kindliness of his nature is everywhere apparent
and gives a sincerity to the poems in which he portrays with rare
discernment and sympathy the sufferings of the artisan toiling from
morning to night on eight shillings a week His pathos has dignity and
restraint and in the poem I niver can call her my wife it rises to the
heights of great tragedy This is Ben Prestons masterpiece and though
scarcely known outside of the county it deserves to take a place side by
side with Hoods  Song of the Shirt by reason of the poignancy with
which it interprets the tragedy of penury5

The example set by Ben Preston has been followed by other dialect poets
living in the district round Bradford Mention may be made of James
Burnley whose poem Jims Letter is a telling illustration of the
fine use which can be made of dialect in the service of the dramatic
lyric and of Abraham Holroyd who not only wrote original verse but
also made a valuable collection of old Yorkshire songs and ballads6

The rivalry between Bradford and Leeds is proverbial and though the
latter city has lagged behing Bradford in the production of dialect
literature the Yorkshire Songs of J H Eccles published in 1862 is a
notable contribution to the movement whose history is here being
recorded In John Hartley Halifax possessed the most versatile
dialectwriter that Yorkshire has so far produced For fifty years this
writer who died in 1915 poured forth lyric song and prose tale in
unstinted measure Most of his dialect work found a place in the
Original Illuminated Clock Almanac which he edited from 1867 until his
death but from time to time he gathered the best of his work into book
form and his Yorkshire Lyrics published in 1898 occupy a place of
honour in many a Yorkshire home The examples from his works here given
will serve to illustrate his fine ear for metrical harmony his
imaginative power and his sympathetic interpretation of Yorkshire
character Of the younger generation of Yorkshire poets most of them
still alive I must speak more briefly But it must not be overlooked
that so far from there being any falling off in the volume or quality of
dialectverse it is safe to say that it has never been in so flourishing
a condition as at the present day Dialect poems are now being written
in all parts of the county Editors of weekly papers welcome them gladly
in their columns the Yorkshire Dialect Society has recently opened the
pages of its annual Transactions to original contributions in verse and
prose and every year the printing presses of London and Yorkshire
publish volumes of dialect verse Of individual writers whose work
finds illustration in this anthology mention may be made of the Rev W
H Oxley whose T Fisher Folk o Riley Brig 1888 marks I believe the
first attempt to interpret in verse the hazardous life of the eastcoast
fisherman Farther north Mr G H Cowling has given us in his A
Yorkshire Tyke 1914 a number of spirited and winsome studies of the
life and thought of the Hackness peasant The wold country of the East
Riding has found its interpreter in Mr J A Carill whose Wozls
1913 is full of delightful humour as readers of Love and Pie will
readily discover for themselves The Filecutters Lament  see
below which I have selected from Mr Downings volume Smook thru a
Shevvield Chimla will show that the Sheffield blade is doing his best
to carry on the tradition set by Abel Bywater eighty years ago Airedale
still has its poets among the most ambitious of whom is Mr
MalhamDembleby who published in 1912 a volume of verse entitled
Original Tales and Ballads in the Yorkshire Dialect Mr F J Newboult
has deservedly won fame as a prosewriter in dialect his dialect sketches
which have for some years appeared in The Yorkshire Observer are full of
broad humour and dramatic power and his dainty little lyric Spring p
87 is a sufficient indication that he has also the dower of the poet
In Alderman Ben Turner of Batley Yorkshire possesses a courageous
advocate of the social betterment of the working man and woman and in
the midst of a busy life he has found time to give utterance to his
indignation and his faith in dialectpoems which appeal from the heart to
the heart Mr Walter Hampson of Normanton writes in a lighter vein
in his Tykes Abrooad 1911 he is our Yorkshire Mark Twain and his
narrative of the adventures of a little party of Yorkshiremen in Normandy
and Brittany is full of humour Songs are scattered through the story
and one of these Owd England finds a place in this collection The
Colne Valley and the country round Huddersfield has been somewhat slow in
responding to the call of the homely muse of dialect but Mr E A
Lodges little volume of verse and prose entitled Odds an Ends
marks a successful beginning

In our account of the history of dialect poetry in Yorkshire it will have
been noticed that the chief forms of verse to which local poets have had
recourse have been the song personal or dramatic the ballad and the
dialogue Among the most hopeful signs of the times has been the recent
extension of dialect to poems of a more sustained character Within the
last twenty years two writers associated with the far north and the far
south of the county respectively have made the bold attempt to use
dialect in narrative poems of larger compass than the simple ballad
These are Mr Richard Blakeborough the author of T Hunt o Yatton
Brigg 1896 and Mr J S Fletcher who as recently as 1915 published
in the dialect of Osgoldcross his Leet Livvy These two poems are in
general character poles apart that of Mr Blakeborough is pure romance
whereas Mr Fletcher never steps aside from the strait path of realism
T Hunt o Yatton Brigg is steeped in all the eerie witchlore of the
Cleveland moors The plot is laid in the district round the famous
Roseberry Topping and deals with the adventures which befall a certain
Johnny Simpson who when crossed in love seeks the aid of the witches
to aid him in his work of vengeance on the woman who has cast him off
The story is told with great vividness and the author has made an
effective use of all the malevolent powers of witchcraft seconded by the
elemental forces of thunder and lightning to aid him in telling a story
of great dramatic power Leet Livvy on the other hand is as sober and
restrained as one of the versetales of Crabbe and the only resemblance
which it bears to Mr Blakeboroughs witchstory lies in the fact that
its hero like Johnny Simpson belongs to the peasantry and has suffered
at the hands of a woman The tragic story of Owd Mattha o Marlby Moor
is recorded by the sexton whose duty it is to toll the passing bell and
Mr Fletcher whose reputation as a novelist is deservedly high has
rendered the narrative with consummate art The use of dialect enhances
the directness and dramatic realism of the story at every turn the
characters stand out sharp and clear and we are brought face to face
with the passion that makes for tragedy The poem is purged clean of all
sentiment and moralising it is narrative pure and simple but aglow with
the lurid flame of a passion that burns to the very roots of life It is
no exaggeration to say that Leet Livvy is the greatest achievement in
Yorkshire dialect poetry up to the present time let us hope that it is
an earnest of even greater things yet to come

The duty still remains of offering a few words of explanation concerning
the poems which find a place in the second part of this anthology and
which I have classified as traditional poems It is not contended that
all of these are folkpoems in the strict sense of the term but all of
them are of unknown authorship and for most of them a considerable
antiquity may be claimed moreover like the folksong they owe their
preservation rather to oral tradition than to the labours of the scribe
Many of these poems enshrine some of the customs and superstitions of the
countryside and carry our thoughts back to a time when the
Yorkshiremans habit of mind was far more primitive and childlike than it
is today Moreover though many of the old popular beliefs and rites
have vanished before the advance of education and industrialism the
Yorkshireman still clings to the past with a tenacity which exceeds that
of the people farther to the south For example nowhere in England does
the old folkplay which enacts the combats of St George with his Saracen
adversaries enjoy such popularity as in the upper waters of the Calder
Valley and in busy Rochdale over the border This play known locally as
The Peace or Pasque ie Easter Egg was once acted all over
England Driven from the countryside where old traditions usually live
the longest it survives amid the smokeladen atmosphere of cottonmills
and in towns which pride themselves not without reason on their love of
progress and their readiness to receive new ideas It is for our
purpose unfortunate that this fine old play preserves little of the
local dialect and is therefore excluded from this anthology7 Apart
from The Peace Egg it is the remote Cleveland country in the North
Riding in which the old traditional poetry of Yorkshire has been best
preserved This is the land of the sworddance the bridalgarter and
the mell supper the land in which primitive faiths and traditions
survive with strange tenacity The late Canon Atkinson has made this
land familiar to us by his fascinating Forty Years in a Moorland Parish
and to the lover of traditional dialect songs an even greater service
has been rendered by a later gleaner in this harvestfield Mr Richard
Blakeborough of NortononTees whose T Hunt o Yatton Brigg has already
been considered In his supplement to the little volume which contains
that poem and again in his highly instructive and entertaining Wit
Character Folklore and Customs of the North Riding of Yorkshire Mr
Blakeborough has brought together a number of traditional songs and
proverbial rhymes of great interest and to some extent at least of
high antiquity Many of these have been collected by him among the
peasantry others are taken from a manuscript collection of notes on
North Riding folklore made by a certain George Calvert early in the
nineteenth century and now in Mr Blakeboroughs possession

Of the first importance in this anthology of traditional song are the
Cleveland Lykewake Dirge and A Dree Neet The former has been well
known to lovers of poetry since Sir Walter Scott included it in his
Border Minstrelsy the latter I believe was never published until the
appearance of T Hunt o Yatton Brigg in 1896 The tragic power and
suggestiveness of these two poems is very remarkable It is I think
fairly certain that they stand in intimate association with one another
and point back to a time when the prevailing creed of Yorkshire was Roman
Catholicism Both depict with deep solemnity the terrors of death and of
the Judgment which lies beyond Whinny Moor appears in either poem as
the desolate moorland tract beset with prickly whinbushes and flinty
stones which the dead man must traverse on shoonless feet on his
journey from life And beyond this moor lies the still more mysterious
Brig o Dreead or  Brig o Deead as A Dree Neet renders it It
would be tempting to conjecture the precise significance of this
allusion and to connect it with other primitive myths and legends of a
similar character but space fails us and it may well be that the very
vagueness of the allusion is of more haunting tragic power than precise
knowledge It is also interesting to notice the effective use which is
made in A Dree Neet of all the superstitions which gather about the
great pageant of death The flight of the Gabriel ratchets or Gabriel
hounds through the sky the fluttering of bats at the casement and of
moths at the candle flame and the shroud of soot which falls from the
chimney of the room where the dying man lies are introduced with fine
effect while the curious reference to the folk that draw nigh from the
other side of the grave has an Homeric ring about it and recalls the
great scene in the Odyssey where the ghosts of Elpenor Teiresias and
other dead heroes gather about the trench that Odysseus has digged on the
other side of the great stream of Oceanus hard by the dank house of
Hades

It is unnecessary to speak at any length of the other songs proverbial
rhymes and nominies which find a place among the traditional poems in
this collection The mummingsongs the boisterous Ridin t stang
verses and all the snatches of folksong which are associated with the
festive ritual of the circling year either carry their own explanation
with them or have been elucidated by those who have written on the
subject of Yorkshire customs and folklore I heartily commend to the
readers notice the three songs entitled The Bridal Bands The Bridal
Garter and Nance and Tom which we owe to Mr Blakeborough and which
present to us in so delightful a manner the picture of the bride tying
her garter of wheaten and oaten straws about her left leg and the
bridegroom unloosing it after the wedding It is hoped too that the
reader may find much that is interesting in the singinggames verses and
the rhymes which throw light upon the vanishing customs folklore and
faiths of the county They serve to lift the veil which hides the past
from the present and to give us visions of a world which is fast passing
out of sight and out of memory It is a world where one may still
faintly hear the horns of elfland blowing and where Hobtrush Hob and
little Nanny Buttoncap wander on printless feet through the starlit
glades where charms are still recited when the moon is new and where on
St Agnes Eve the milkmaid lets the twelve sageleaves fall from her
casementwindow and like Keatss Madeline peers through the honeyd
middle of the night for a glimpse of the Porphyro to whom she must
pledge her troth

 which robbed the peasent farmer of his rights to use Commons

 Alas will Roger eer his sleep forgo
 Afore larks sing or early cocks gin Crow
 As Ive for thee ungrateful maiden done
 To help thee milking eer day wark begun
 And when thy wellstrippd kye1 would yield no more
 Still on my head the reeking kit2 I bore
 And Oh bethink thee then what lovesome talk
 Weve held together ganging down the balk
 Maundring3 at time which would na for us stay
 But now I ween maes4 no such hast away
 Yet O return eftsoon and ease my woe
 And to some distant parish let us go
 And there again them leetsome days restore
 Where unassaild by meety5 folk in power
 Our cattle yet may feed tho Snaith Marsh be no more
 But wae is me I wot I fand6 am grown
 Forgetting Susan is already gone
 And Roger aims eer Lady Day to wed
 The banns last Sunday in the church were bid
 But let me let me first i t churchyard lig
 For soon I there must gang my griefs so big
 All others in their loss some comfort find
 Though Neds like me reducd yet Jennys kind
 And though his fleece no more our parson taks
 And roast goose dainty food our table lacks
 Yet he for tithes ill paid gets better land
 While I am evry o t losing hand
 My adlings wared7 and yet my rent to pay
 My geese like Susans faith flown far away
 My cattle like their master lank and poor
 My heart with hopeless love to pieces tore

Im Yorkshire too

 Anonymous

 From A Garland of New Songs published by W Appleton
 Darlington 1811

 By t side of a brig that stands over a brook
 I was sent betimes to school
 I went wi the stream as I studied my book
 An was thought to be no small fool
 I never yet bought a pig in a poke
 For to give awd Nick his due
 Tho oft Ive dealt wi Yorkshire folk
 Yet I was Yorkshire too

 I was pretty well likd by each village maid
 At races wake or fair
 For my father had addled a vast1 in trade
 And I were his son and heir
 And seeing that I didnt want for brass
 Poor girls came first to woo
 But tho I delight in a Yorkshrre lass
 Yet I was Yorkshire too

 To Lunnon by father I was sent
 Genteeler manners to see
 But fashions so dear I came back as I went
 And so they made nothing o me
 My kind relations would soon have found out
 What was best wi my money to do
 Says I My dear cousins I thank ye for nowt
 But Im not to be cozend by you
 For Im Yorkshire too

The Wensleydale Lad

 Anonymous

 When I were at home wi my fayther an mother
 I niver had na fun
 They kept me goin frae morn to neet
 so I thowt frae them Id run
 Leeds Fair were coomin on
 an I thowt Id have a spree
 So I put on my Sunday cooat
 an went right merrily

 First thing I saw were t factory
 I niver seed one afore
 There were threads an tapes an tapes an silks
 to sell by monny a score
 Owd Ned turnd ivry wheel
 an ivry wheel a strap
 Begor says I to t maisterman
 Owd Neds a rare strong chap

 Next I went to Leeds Owd Church
 I were niver i one i my days
 An I were maistly ashamed o misel
 for I didnt knaw their ways
 There were thirty or forty folk
 i tubs an boxes sat
 When up cooms a saucy owd fellow
 Says he Noo lad tak off thy hat

 Then in there cooms a great Lord Mayor
 an over his shooders a club
 An he gat into a white sackpoke1
 an gat into t topmost tub
 An then there cooms anither chap
 I thinks they calld him Ned
 An he gat into t bottommost tub
 an mockd all t other chap said

 So they began to preach an pray

 When up jumps t chap i t bottommost tub

 while others did grunt an groan

 So I clickd hod3 o my gret club stick

 Thomas Browne 17711798

 Ye loitring minutes faster flee
 Y are all ower slow by hauf for me
 That wait impatient for the mornin
 Tomorns the lang langwishdfor fair
 Ill try to shine the fooremost there
 Misen in finest claes adornin
 To grace the day

 Ill put my best white stockings on
 An pair o new caufleather shoon
 My clane washd gown o printed cotton
 Aboot my neck a muslin shawl
 A new silk handkerchee ower all
 Wi sike a careless air Ill put on
 Ill shine this day

 My partner Ned I know thinks he
 Hell mak hiss en secure o me
 Hes often said hed treat me rarely
 But Is think o some other fun
 Ill aim for some rich farmers son
 And cheat oor simple Neddy fairly
 Sae sly this day

 Why mud not I succeed as weel
 An get a man full oot genteel
 As awd John Darbys daughter Nelly
 I think misen as good as she
 She cant mak cheese or spin like me
 Thats mair an1 beauty let me tell ye
 On onny day

 Then hey for sports and puppy shows
 An temptin spicestalls rangd i rows
 An danglin dolls by t necks all hangin
 An thousand other pratty seets
 An lasses trauld2 alang the streets
 Wi lads to t yalhoose gangin

The Invasion An Ecologue

 Thomas Browne 17711798

 Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebitVirgil

 A wanton wether had disdaind the bounds
 That kept him close confind to Willys grounds
 Broke through the hedge he wanderd far astray
 He knew not whither on the public way
 As Willy strives with all attentive care
 The fence to strengthen and the gap repair
 His neighbour Roger from the fair returnd
 Appears in sight in ridinggraith adornd
 Whom soon as Willy fast approaching spies
 Thus to his friend behind the hedge he cries

 WILLY
 How dea ye Roger Hae ye been at t fair
 How gangs things Made ye onny bargains there

 ROGER
 I knaw not Willy things deant look ower weel
 Coorn sattles fast thof beas1 ll fetch a deal

Elegy on the Death of a Frog 1815

 David Lewis

 Ya summer day when I were mowin
 When flooers of monny soorts were growin
 Which fast befoor my scythe fell bowin
 As I advance
 A frog I cut widout my knowin
 A sad mischance

 Poor luckless frog why com thoo here
 Thoo sure were destitute o fear
 Some other way could thoo nut steer
 To shun the grass
 For noo that life which all hod dear
 Is gean alas

 Hadst thoo been freetend by the soond
 With which the mowers strip the groond
 Then fled away wi nimble boond
 Thood kept thy state
 But I unknawin gav a wound
 Which browt thy fate

 Sin thoo com frae thy parent spawn
 Wi painted cooat mair fine than lawn
 And golden rings round baith ees drawn
 All gay an blithe
 Thoo lowpt1 the fields like onny fawn
 But met the scythe

 Frae dikes where winter watters steead2
 Thoo com unto the dewy mead
 Regardless of the cattles treead
 Wi pantin breeath
 For to restore thy freezin bleead
 But met wi deeath

 A Frenchman early seekin prog3
 Will oftentimes ransack the bog
 To finnd a sneel or weelfed frog
 To give relief
 But I prefer a leg of hog
 Or roond o beef

 But liker far to the poor frog
 Is wanderin through the world for prog
 Where deeath gies monny a yan a jog
 An cuts them doon
 An though I think misen incog
 That way Is boun

 Time whets his scythe and shakes his glass
 And though I know all flesh be grass
 Like monny mair I play the ass
 Dont seem to know
 But here wad sometime langer pass
 Befoor I go

 Ye bonnie lasses livin flooers
 Of cottage mean or gilded booers
 Possessed of attractive pooers
 Ye all mun gang
 Like frogs in meadows fed by shooers
 Ere owt be lang

 Though we to stately plants be grown
 He easily can mow us doon
 It may be late or may be soon
 His scythe we feel
 Or is it fittin to be known
 Therefore fareweel

Address to Poverty

 Anonymous

 Scoolin maid o iron broo
 Thy sarvant will address thee noo
 For thoo invites the freedom
 By drivin off my former friends
 To leak to their awn private ends
 Just when I chancd to need em

 Ive had thy company ower lang
 Illlookin wean1 thoo must be wrang
 Thus to cut short my jerkin
 I ken thee weel I knaw thy ways
 Thoos awlus kept back cash an claes
 An foorcd me to hard workin

 To gain o thee a yal2 days march
 I straave bud thoos sae varra arch
 For all I still straave faster
 Thoos trippd my heels an meade me stop
 By some slain corn or failin crop
 Or ivery foul disaster

 If I my maand may freely speak
 I really dunnot like thy leak
 Whativer shap thoos slippd on
 Thoos awd an ugly deeaf an blinnd
 A fiend afoore a freight behinnd
 An foul as Mother Shipton

 Folks say an it is nowt bud truth
 Thoo has been wi me frae my youth
 An gien me monny a thumper
 Bud noo thoo cooms wi all thy weight
 Fast fallin frae a fearful height
 A doonreet Milton plumper

 Sud plenty frae her copious horn
 Teem1 oot to me good crops o corn
 An prosper weel my cattle
 An send a single thoosand pund
 T wad bring all things completely roond
 An I wad gie thee battle

 Noo Poverty ya thing I beg
 Like a poor man withoot a leg
 Sea prethee dont deceive me
 I knaw its i thy power to grant
 The laatle favour at I want 
 At thoo wad gang an leave me

The Collingham Ghost

 Anonymous

 Ill tell ye aboot the Collingham ghost
 An a rare awd ghost was he
 For he could laugh an he could talk
 An run an jump an flee

 He went aboot hither an thither
 An freetend some out o their wits
 He freetend the parson as weel as the clerk
 An lots beside them into fits

 The poor awd man wha teak the toll
 At Collingham bar for monny a year
 He dursnt coom out to oppen his yat2
 For fear the ghost sud be near

 He teak to his bed an there he laid
 For monny a neet an day
 His yat was awlus wide oppen thrown
 An nean iver stoppd to pay

 Awd Jerry wha kept the public hoose
 An selld good yal to all
 Cursd the ghost wi hearty good will
 For neabody stoppd to call

 It made sike a noise all roond aboot
 That folks com far to see
 Some said it was a dreadful thing
 An sum said t was a lee

 Gamkeepers com wi dogs an guns
 Thinkin t was some comical beast
 An they wad eyther kill him or catch him
 Or drive him awa at least

 Sea into Lady wood right they went
 Ya beautiful meenleet neet
 A lot o great men an a lot o rough dogs
 Enew3 a poor ghost to eat

 They waited lang the ghost didnt come
 They began to laugh an rail
 If he coom oat of his den says yan
 Well clap a bit o saut of his tail

 Nay he knows better than turn oot
 When we are here to watch him
 Hed git a bullet through his lug
 Or Mungo there wad catch him

 When close to their heads wi a terrible clatter
 The ghost went whirrin up
 An owerr the woods he laughed an shouted
 Bobo bobo who whoop who whoop

 The gamkeepers all tummled doon
 Their hair thrast off their hat
 They gaped an greand4 an rolld aboot
 An their hearts went pitapat

 Their feaces were white as onny clout
 An they said niver a word
 They couldnt tell what the ghost was like
 Whether twas a beast or a bird

 They stayd nea langer i t wood that neet
 Poor men were niver dafter
 They ran awa hame as fast as they could
 An their dogs ran yelping after

 The parson then a larned man
 Said he wad conjure the ghost
 He was sure it was nea wandrin beast
 But a spirit that was lost

 All languages this parson knew
 That onny man can chat in
 The Ebrew Greek an Irish too
 As weel as Dutch an Latin

 O he could talk an read an preach
 Few men knew mair or better
 An nearly all the bukes he read
 Were printed in black letter

 He read a neet he read a day
 fo mak him fit for his wark
 An when he thowt he was quite up
 He sent for the awd clerk

 The clerk was quickly by his side
 He took but little fettlin
 An awa they went wi right good will
 To gie the ghost a settlin

 Aye off they set wi all their might
 Nor stoppd at thin or thick
 The parson wi his sark5 an buke
 The clerk wi a thick stick

 At last by t side o t bank they stoppd
 Where Wharfe runs murmurin clear
 A beautiful river breet an fine
 As onny in wide Yorkshire

 The parson then began to read
 An read full loud an lang
 The rabbits they ran in an oot
 An wonderd what was wrang

 The ghost was listnin in a hole
 An oat he bangd at last
 The fluttrin o his mighty wings
 Was like a whirlwind blast

 He laughed an shooted as he flew
 Until the wild woods rang
 His whowhowhoop was niver heard
 Sea load an clear an strang

 The parson he fell backwards ower
 Into a bush o whins
 An lost his buke an rave6 his sark7
 An prickd his hands an shins

 The clerk he tried to run awa
 But tummld ower his stick
 An there he made a nasty smell
 While he did yell an fick8

 An lots o pranks this ghost he playd
 That here I darnt tell
 For if I did folks wad declare
 I was as ill as hissel

 For eighteen months an mair he stayd
 An just did as he thowt 
 For lord nor duke parson nor clerk
 He feard nor cared nowt

 Efter that time he went awa
 Just when it pleasd hissel
 But what he was or whar he com fra
 Nea mortal man can tell

The Yorkshire Horse Dealers

 Anonymous

 Bain1 to Clapham townend lived an owd Yorkshire tike
 Who i dealing i horseflesh had neer met his like
 T were his pride that i all the hard bargains hed hit
 Hed bit a girt monny but niver bin bit

 This owd Tommy Towers by that name he were known
 Had an owd carrion tit2 that were sheer skin an bone
 To have killed him for t curs wad have bin quite as well
 But t were Tommys opinion hed dee on himsel

 Well yan Abey Muggins a neighborin cheat
 Thowt to diddle owd Tommy wad be a girt treat
 Hed a horse too t were war3 than owd Tommys ye see
 For t neet afore that hed thowt proper to dee 

 Thinks Abey t owd codger ll niver smoke t trick
 Ill swop wi him my poor deead horse for his wick4
 An if Tommy I nobbut can happen to trap
 T will be a fine feather i Abraham cap

 So to Tommy he goes an the question he pops
 Betwin thy horse and mine prithee Tommy what swops
 What wilt gie me to boot for mines t better horse still
 Nowt says Tommy Ill swop even hands an ye will

 Abey preached a lang time about summat to boot
 Insistin that his were the liveliest brute
 But Tommy stuck fast where he first had begun
 Till Abey shook hands an said Well Tommy I done

 O Tommy said Abey Is sorry for thee
 I thowt thoud hae hadden mair white i thy ee
 Good lucks wi thy bargain for my horse is deead
 Hey says Tommy my lad so is mine an its fleead5

 So Tommy got t better o t bargain a vast
 An cam off wi a Yorkshiremans triumph at last
 For thof twixt deead horses theres not mich to choose
 Yet Tommy were richer by t hide an fower shooes

The Lucky Dream

 John Castillo 17921845

 Ya Kessmas neet or then aboot
 When measons all were frozzen oot
 I went to see a country friend
 An hospitable hoor to spend
 For gains I cut across o t moor
 Whoor t snaw sea furiously did stoor1
 The hoose I gaind an enterd in
 An were as welcome as a king
 The storm agean t windey patterd
 An hailsteans doon t chimley clatterd
 All hands were in an seemd content
 An nean did frost or snaw lament
 T lasses all were at their sewing
 Their cheeks wiv health an beauty glowing
 Aroond the hearth in cheerful chat
 Twea or three friendly neighbours sat
 Their travels telling whoor theyd been
 An what they had beath heeard an seen
 Till yan did us all mich amuse
 An thus a story introduce
 I recollect lang saan2 says he
 A story that were telld to me
 At seems sea strange i this oor day
 That true or false I cannot say
 A man livd i this neighbourhood
 Nea doot of reputation good
 An lang taame strave wi stiddy care
 To keep his hoosehod i repair
 At length he had a curious dream
 For three neets runnin t were the seame
 At3 if on Lunnon Brig he stood
 Hed hear some news would dea him good
 He labourd hard beath neet an day
 Tryin to draave those thowts away
 Yet daily grew mair discontent
 Till he at last to Lunnon went
 Being quite a stranger to that toon
 Lang taame he wanderd up an doon
 Till led by some mysterious hand
 On Lunnon Brig he teak his stand
 An there he waited day by day
 An just were boun4 to coom away
 Sea mich he thowt he were to bleame
 To gang sea far aboot a dream
 When thus a man as he drew near
 Did say Good friend what seek you here
 Where I have seen you soon and late
 His dream tiv him he did relate
 Dreams says the man  are empty things
 Mere thoughts that flit on silverd wings
 Unheeded we should let them pass
 Ive had a dream and thus it was
 That somewhere round this peopled ball
 Theres such a place as Lealholm Hall5
 Yet whether such a place there be
 Or not is all unknown to me
 There in a cellar dark and deep
 Where slimy creatures nightly creep
 And human footsteps never tread
 There is a store of treasure hid
 If it be so I have no doubt
 Some lucky wight will find it out
 Yet so or not is nought to me
 For I shall neer go there to see
 The man did slyly twice or thrice
 The Cockney thenk for his advice
 Then heame agean withoot delay
 He cherfully did tak his way
 An set aboot the wark an sped
 Fun ivvery thing as t man had said
 Were iver efter seen to flourish
 T fanest gentleman iv all t parish
 Folks wonderd sair an weel they might
 Whoor he gat all his guineas bright
 If it were true i spite o fame
 Tiv him it were a lucky dream

I Niver can call Her my Wife

 Ben Preston 18191902

 Im a weyver ye knaw an awf deead
 So I do all at iver I can
 To put away aat o my heead
 The thowts an the aims of a man
 Eight shillin i twicks what I arn
 When Ive varry gooid wark an full time
 An I think its a sorry consarn
 For a fella ats just in his prime

 Bud aar maister says things is as weel
 As they have been or iver can be
 An I happen sud think so misel
 If hed nobbud swop places wi me
 Bud hes welcome ta all he can get
 I begrudge him o noan of his brass
 An Im nowt bud a madlin1 to fret
 Or to think o yon beautiful lass

 I niver can call her my wife
 My love I sal niver mak knawn
 Yit the sarra that darkens her life
 Thraws its shadda across o my awn
 When I knaw at her heart is at eease
 Theer is sunshine an singin i mine
 An misfortunes may come as they pleease
 Yit they seldom can mak me repine

 Bud that Chartist wor nowt bud a slope2
 I were fooild by his speeches an rhymes
 For his promises wattered my hope
 An I lengd for his sunshiny times
 Bud I feel at my dearest desire
 Within me ll wither away
 Like an ivystem trailin i t mire
 Its deein for t want of a stay

 When I laid i my bed day an neet
 An were geen up by t doctors for deead
 God bless her shood coom wi a leet
 An a basin o grewil an breead
 An I once thowt Id aat wi it all
 Bud so kindly shoo chatted an smiled
 I were fain to turn ovver to t wall
 An to bluther an roar like a child

 An I said as I thowt of her een
 Each breeter for t tear at were in t
 Its a sin to be niver forgeen
 To yoke her to famine an stint
 So Ill een travel forrad throo life
 Like a man throo a desert unknawn
 I mun neer have a home nor a wife
 Bud my sorras ll all be my awn

 So I trudge on alone as I owt
 An whativer my troubles may be
 Theyll be sweetened poor lass wi the thowt
 At Ive niver browt trouble to thee
 Yit a bird has its young uns to guard
 A wild beast a mate in his den
 An I cannot bud think at its hard
 Nay deng it Im roarin agen

 After that saw Him wi barns raand His knee
 Some on em happen poor crayturs like thee

Owd Moxy

 Ben Preston

 Owd Moxy wrowt hard for his morsil o breead
 An to keep up his courage hed sing
 Tho Time wi his scythe hed mawn t crop on his heead
 An then puffed it away wi his wing

 Reight slavish his labour an little his wage
 His path tuv his grave were bud rough
 Poor livin an hardships a deal more nor age
 Hed swealed1 daan his canle to t snuff

 One cowd winter morn as he crept aat o bed
 T owd waller felt dizzy an sore
 Come frame2 us some breykfast Owd Duckfooit he said
 An Ill finish yond fence up at t moor

 Ill tew3 like a brick wi my hammer an mall4
 An Ill bring home my honey to t hive
 An Ill pay t bit o rent an wer5 shopscore an all
 An Ill dee aat o debt if I live

 So Peg made his pobs6 an then futtered7 abaat
 An temmd8 him his tea into t can
 Then teed up some bacon an breead in a claat
 For dearly shoo liked her owd man

 Then Moxy set aat on his wearisome way
 Wadin bravely throo t snawbroth i t dark
 Its a pity when fellas ats wakely an grey
 Hes to walk for a mile to their wark

 Bud summat that mornin made Moxy turn back
 Tho he hardly knew what it could meean
 So cudlin Owd Peggy he gave her a smack
 An then started for t common ageean

 All t day a wild hurricane wutherd9 throo t glen
 An then rushd like a fiend up to t heeath
 An as Peggy sat knittin shoo said tuv hersen
 Aw dear hell be starruvd to t deeath

 An shoo felt all that day as shood neer felt afore
 An shoo dreeaded yit hungerd for neet 
 When harknin an tremlin shoo heeard abaat t door
 A mutterin an shufflin o feet

 Five minutes at after10 Owd Peg on her knees
 Were kussin a forehead like stone
 An to t men at stood by her wi tears i their ees
 Shoo said Go lads an leave me alone

 When they straightened his body all ready for t kist11
 It were seen at hed thowt of his plan
 For t shopscore an t rent war safe locked in his fist
 So he deed aat o debt like a man

Ode to t Mooin

 J H Eccles 18241883

 I like to see thy quaint owd face
 Lewk softly daan on me
 Een though I neer could find thy nose
 Nor catch thy watchful ee

 Full monny times Ive seen thee rise
 When busy day were done
 When daan behint t owd maantain tops
 Had passed t breet evenin sun

 I like to see thee when sweet spring
 Cooms back to hill an vale
 When odours rise through t hawthorn bush
 An float on t evenin gale

 When lovers walk on t primrose benks
 An whisper soft an low
 Dreamin just same as me an t wife
 Did monny years ago

 I like to see thee when t June rose
 Is wet wi fallin dew
 When t nightingale maks t owd woods ring
 Wi music fresh an new

 When fairies dance on t top o t flaars
 An roam through t pleasant dells
 Like monarchs i their marble halls
 I t lilies virgin bells

 I like to see thee when t ripe corn
 Is wavin to an fro
 When t squirril goes aseekin nuts
 An jumps thro bough to bough

 When t purple heather covers t hills
 An t hunters tired and worn
 Back through the fairyhaunted glens
 Unto their homes return

 I like to see thee when all raand
 Is white wi drivven snow
 When t streams are stoppd by owd Jack Frost
 An foaks slip as they go

 I like to see thee all t year raand
 When t sky is fair an breet
 An allus hail wi fond delight
 The noble queen o t neet

 I used to think at I could reach
 Up to thy face wi ease
 If I had but a big long stick
 For tha were but green cheese

 But naa Ive got far different thowts
 An learnt to understand
 At tha art one o t wondrous works
 Formed by t gert Makers hand




Aunt Nancy

 J H Eccles

 Aunt Nancys one o t savin sort
 At niver lets t chonce pass
 Yet wouldnt do owt mean or low
 For t sake o gettin t brass

 Her homes as clean as need be seen
 Whoiver may go in
 An as for Nancy dearame
 Shoos like a newmade pin

 Shoos full o thrift an full o sense
 An full o love beside
 Shoo rubs an scrubs thro morn to neet
 An maks t owd haase her pride

 Her husband when his wark is doon
 Sits daan i t owd arm chair 
 Forgets his troubles as he owt
 An loises all his care

 Wi pipe an book i t chimley nook
 Time flies on noiseless wing
 Shoo sits an knits wi pleasant face
 Hes happy as a king

 Wi tattlin folks shoos niver seen
 I alley loin1 or street
 But goes her way wi modest step
 Exact an clean an neat

 Her neighbours soomtimes watch her aat
 An say shoos praad an stiff
 But all their gossip cooms to nowt
 Aunt Nancys reight enif

 Wi basket oft shoo walks abroad
 To some poor lonely elf
 To ivery one shoo knaws t reight way
 Ats poorer nor2 herself

 Shoo niverr speyks o what shoo gives
 Kind gentlehearted sowl
 I charity her hands find wark
 Shoos good alike to all

 He niver tells her what he thinks
 Nor flatters nor reproves
 His life is baand wi gowlden bands
 To t woman at he loves

 God bless her shoos a dimond breet
 Both good i mind an heart
 An angel spreeadin light an love
 That plays a noble part

 Shoos worthy of a monarchs choice
 Her worth can neer be towld 
 Shoo cam to mak folks hearts feel glad
 Shoos worth her weight i gowld

 Coom don on thy bonnet an shawl
 An straighten thy cap an thy hair

 To see thee sit dazzin2 i t chair

 On t crags close at side o t becksteead

 To pass a few minutes away
 An listen t birds sing on each tree
 Their carols for closin the day

 An all aboot t green nobby hills
 T lile daisies their beauties will show
 An t perfume at Flora distils
 Like breath o the mornin will blow

 Then don on thy bonnet an shawl
 An coom lets be walkin away

 To see thee sit dazzin all t day

The Christmas Party 1876

 Tom Twistleton

 When cowd Decembers sturdy breeze
 In chimleytops did grumble
 Or tearing through the leafless trees
 On lang dark neets did rumble
 A lot o young folks smart an gay
 An owds uns free an hearty
 Agreed amang thersels at they
 Would have a Christmas party
 At hame some neet

 They kicked up sich a fuss an spreead
 An made sich preparations
 They baked grand tarts an mixed their breead
 Wi spices frae all nations
 To drive away baith want an cowd
 It seemd their inclination
 An t neebours round baith young an owd
 All gat an invitation
 To gang that neet




Smart sprigs o spruce an ivy green
 Were frae the ceiling hinging
 An in their midst conspicuous seen
 The mistletoe was swinging
 The lamp shone forth as clear as day
 An nowt was there neglected
 An t happy smiling faces say
 Some company is expected
 To coom this neet

 An first com Moll wi girt lang Jack
 A strapping goodlike fella
 An following closely at their back
 Com Bob and Isabella
 With Hows yoursel an How dye do
 They sit down i their places
 Till t room sae big all through an through
 Wi happy smiling faces
 Was filled that neet

 A merrier lot than this I name
 Neer met at onny party
 All girt grand balls they put to shame
 They were sae gay an hearty
 Here yan had made hersel quite fine
 Wi lace an braids assistance
 An there a girt grand crinoline
 To keep t lads at a distance
 Stood out that neet

 The lads draw up to t fire their chairs
 An merrily pass their jokes off
 The lasses all slip off upstairs
 To pu their hats an cloaks off
 Befoor a glass that hings at t side
 They all tak up their station
 An think within theirsels wi pride
 Theyll cause a girt sensation
 Mang t lads that neet

 An now the lusty Christmas cheer
 Is browt out for t occasion
 To pies an tarts an beef an beer
 They git an invitation
 An some i tune to put it by
 Play havoc on each dainty
 Whal some there is sae varra shy
 Scarce let theirsels have plenty
 To eat that neet

 Against the host o good things there
 They wage an awful battle
 Theyre crying out A lile bit mair
 An plates an glasses rattle
 Here yans nae time a word to pass
 Thrang1 supping an thrang biting
 There simpering sits a girt soft lass
 That waits for mich inviting
 An fuss that neet

 An when this good substantial fare
 Has gien em satisfaction
 They side2 all t chairs an stand i pairs
 Wi heels i tune for action
 Seesawing t fiddler now begins
 The best that he is able
 He rosins t stick an screws up t pins
 An jumps up on to t table
 To play that neet

 There back an forrad in an out
 His elbow it gaas silting3
 An to an fro an round about
 The dancers they are lilting
 Some dance wi ease i splendid style
 Wi tightlyfitting togs on
 Whal others bump about all t while
 Like drainers wit their clogs on
 Sae numbd that neet

 An when theyve reeld an dancd their fling
 Their chairs all round are ranged
 They tell droll tales they laugh they sing
 An jokes are interchanged
 A merry tune t girt kettle sings
 An t fire is blazing breetly 
 Wi cheerful din t owd farmhouse rings
 An hours fly ower them sweetly
 An swift that neet

 T owd women preach an talk about
 Their claes being owd an rotten
 An still being forcd to speck an clout4
 Its sich a price is cotton
 T owd men sit round wi pipe an glass
 In earnest conversation
 On t ways an means o saving brass
 An t rules an t laws o t nation
 They talk that neet

 Now girt lang Jack that lives on t moor
 Wi cunning an wi caution
 Is beckoning Moll to gang to t door
 Wi sly mischievous motion
 Moll taks the hint nor thinks it wrang
 Her heart that way inclining
 She says to t rest she thinks shell gang
 To see if t stars are shining
 Out clear that neet

 Then down a field they tak a walk
 An then they wend their way back
 To have a bit o pleasant talk
 They shelter under t haystack
 She did not say For shame not she
 Though ofttimes Johnny kissd her
 She said she just would run an see
 If t other folks had missed her
 Frae t room that neet

 A chap that had two watchful een
 Of which they warent thinking
 When peeping round that neet had seen
 Long Jack at Molly winking
 Says he Nows t time to have a stir
 Lets just gang out an watch her
 Wes have some famous fun wi her
 If we can nobbut catch her
 Wi him this neet

 Then two or three bent on a spree
 Out to the door gang thungein5
 But hauf a yard they scarce could see
 It was as dark as dungeon
 Jack hears their footsteps coming slow
 An frae her side he slinks off
 Runs round t houseend jumps ower a wa
 An up ower t knee i t sinktrough
 He splashd that neet

 Now ye young men be who ye may
 Thats bent on fun an sportin
 Whareer ye be by neet or day
 Remember Jacks misfortin
 Though things unlookd for on ye creep
 Dont do owt in a splutter
 But learn to look befoor ye leap
 Lest ye in some deep gutter
 Stick fast some neet

 Who is it at lives i that cot on the lea

 Who is it I see i my dreams of a neet 
 Who lovingly whispers words tender an sweet
 Till I wakken to find shoos nowheer i t seet

 Who is it at leads me so lively a donce
 Yet to tawk serious neer gies me a chonce
 An niver replied when I begged on her once
 Nelly o Bobs o t Crowtrees

 Who is it at ivery chaps hankerin to get
 Yet tosses her heead an flies off in a pet
 As mich as to say Youve not getten me yet
 Nelly o Bobs o t Crowtrees

 Who is it could mak life a long summers day
 Whose smile would drive sorrow an trouble away
 An mak t hardest wark if for her seem like play
 Nelly o Bobs o t Crowtrees

 Who is it Ill have if Ive iver a wife
 An love her her only to th end o my life
 An nurse her i sickness an guard her from strife
 Nelly o Bobs o t Crowtrees

 Who is it ats promised toneet if its fine
 To meet me at t corner o t mistal1 at nine
 Why its her at Ive langed for so long to mak mine

Bite Bigger

 John Hartley

 As I hurried through t taan to my wark
 I were lat1 for all t buzzers had gooan
 I happend to hear a remark
 At ud fotch tears thro th heart of a stooan

 It were rainin an snawin an cowd
 An th flagstones were coverd wi muck
 An th east wind both whistled an howld
 It saanded like nowt bud ill luck

 When two little lads donnd2 i rags
 Baat3 stockins or shoes o their feet
 Com trapsin away ower t flags
 Boath on em soddend wi t weet

 Th owdest mud happen be ten
 T young un be haulf ont no more
 As I lookd on I said to misen
 God help fowk this weather ats poor

 T big un sammd4 summat off t graand
 An I lookd just to see what t could be
 T were a few wizend flaars hed faand
 An they seemd to hae filld him wi glee

 An he said Coom on Billy may be
 We sal find summat else by an by
 An if not tha mun share these wi me
 When we get to some spot wheer its dry

 Leethearted they trotted away
 An I followd cause t were i my rooad
 But I thowt Id neer seen sich a day
 It wernt fit to be aat for a tooad

 Sooin t big un agean slippd away
 An sammd summat else aat o t muck
 An he cried aat Look here Bill today
 Arnt we blest wi a seet o gooid luck

 Heres a apple an t mooast on its saand
 Whats rotten Ill throw into t street
 Wernt it gooid to lig theer to be faand
 Naa boath on us can have a treat

 So he wipd it an rubbd it an then
 Said Billy thee bite off a bit
 If tha hasnt been lucky thisen
 Tha sal share wi me sich as I get

 So t little un bate off a touch5
 T others face beamd wi pleasure all through
 An he said Nay tha hasnt taen mich
 Bite agean an bite bigger naa do

 I waited to hear nowt no more
 Thinks I theres a lesson for me
 Thas a heart i thy breast if thart poor
 T world were richer wi more sich as thee

 Two pence were all t brass at I had
 An I meant it for ale when com nooin 
 Bud I thowt Ill go give it yond lad
 He desarves it for what hes been doin

 So I said Lad heres twopence for thee
 For thisen An they stard like two geese
 Bud he said whol t tear stood in his ee
 Naa itll just be a penny apiece

 God bless thee do just as tha will
 An may better days speedily come
 Though clammd6 an hauf donnd7 my lad still
 Thart a deal nearer Heaven nor8 some

Rollickin Jack

 John Hartley

 I know a workin lad
 His hands are hard an rough
 His cheeks are red an braan
 But I like him weel enough
 His ees as breet s a bell
 An his curly hair is black
 An he stands six foot in his stockin feet
 An his name is Rollickin Jack

 At morn if we should meet
 He awlus has a smile
 An his heart is gay an leet
 When trudgin to his toil
 He whistles or he sings
 Or he stops a joke to crack
 An monny a lass at he happens to pass
 Looks shyly at Rollickin Jack

 His mothers old an gray
 His fathers deead an gooan
 Hell niver move away
 An leave her all alooan
 Choose who1 should be his wife
 Shooll mak a sad mistak
 For hes ivery inch a mothers lad
 Is this rough an rollickin Jack

 An still I think sometimes
 Th old woman wants a nurse
 An as for weddin Jack
 Why theres monny a lass done worse
 Of coorse its not for me
 To tell him who to tak
 But theres one I could name if I could but for shame
 Just the lass to suit Rollickin Jack

The Window on the Cliff Top 1888

 W H Oxley

 What Margery still at your window
 In this blinding storm and sleet
 Why you cant see your hand before you
 And I scarce could keep my feet

 Why even the coastguards tell me
 That they cannot see the sand
 And we know thank God that the cobles
 And yawls have got to land

 Theres five are safe at Scarbro
 And one has reachd the Tyne
 And two are in the Humber
 And one at Quay2 makes nine

 Aye aye Id needs be watchful
 Theres niver a soul can tell
 An happen twixt yan o t snawblints3
 Yan mud catch a glimpse o t bell

 I reckon nowt o t coastguards
 Whats folks like them to say
 Theres neer a yan amang em
 Knaws owt aboot oor bay

 Is niver leave my winder
 Whiles theres folks as has to droon
 An it wadna be the first time
 As Ive helpd ta wakken t toon

 I isnt good for mich noo
 For my fourscore years is past
 But Is niver quit my winder
 As long as life sal last

 Twas us as seed them Frenchmen
 As wreckd on Speeton sands
 Twas me as seed that schooner
 As founderd wi all hands

 Twas me first spied oor cobles
 Reight ower t end o t Brig
 That time when all was droonded
 I telld em by there rig4

 Aye man Is neen sae drowsy
 Dont talk o bed to me
 Is niver quit my winder
 Whiles theres a moon to see

 Dont talk to me o coastguards
 Whats them to sike as me
 They hasnt got no husbands
 No childer lost i t sea

 Its nobbut them ats felt it
 As sees as I can see
 Its them as is deead already
 Knaws what it is to dee

 Yed niver understan me
 God knaws as dwells above
 Theres hearts doon here lives broken
 Whats niver lost their love

 But better noo yed leave me
 Is mebbe not misen
 We fisherfolks has troubles
 No quality can ken

Aar Maggie

 Edmund Hatton

 I believe aar Maggies coortin
 For shoo dresses hersen so smart
 An shoos allus runnin to t window
 When theres ony o t chaps abaat
 Shoo willent wear her owd shawl
 Bud dons a bonnet atstead1
 An laps her can in her gaan
 As shoo goes to t weyvin shed

 Of a neet wi snoddened2 hair
 An cheeks like a summers cherry
 An lips fair assin3 for kisses
 An een so black an so merry
 Shoo taks her knittin to t meadows
 An sits in a shady newk
 An knits while shoo sighs an watches
 Wi a dreamy lingerin lewk

 Thus knittin sighin an watchin
 Shoo caars4 aat on t soft meadow grass
 Listenin to t murmurin brooklet
 An waitin for t sweetheart to pass
 Shoo drops her wark i her appron
 An glints aat on t settin sun
 An wonders if he goes acourtin
 When his long days wark is done

 When shoo hears t chaps fooitsteps comin
 Shoo rises wi modest grace
 Ay Mag thou sly lovin lassie
 For shame o thy bashful face
 Shoo frames5 to be goin homeards
 As he lilts ower t stile
 Bud when he comes anent6 herr
 Shoo gies him sich a smile

 Then he places his arm araand her
 An shoo creeps cloise to his side
 An leyns her heead on his waiscoit
 An walks wi an air o pride
 Bud oh you sud see her glances
 An oh you sud hear em kiss
 When they pairt thro one another
 If shoo isnt coortin who is

Parson Drew Thro Pudsey 1st Ed
 or
 T First o t Sooart 2nd Ed

 John Hartley

 From pp 135 136 75 76 and 77 of second edition

 I heeard a funny tale last neet
 I couldnt howd frae laughin 
 Twere at t Bulls Head we chonced to meet
 An spent an haar i chaffin
 Some sang a song some cracked a joke
 An all seemed full o larkin 
 An t raam were blue wi bacca smoke
 An ivery ee d a spark in

 Long Joe at comes thro t Jumples Clough
 Were gettin rayther mazy
 An Warkus Ned had supped enough
 To turn their Betty crazy
 An Bob at lives at t Bogeggs farm
 Wi Nan thro t Buttress Bottom
 Were treatin her to summat warm
 Its just his way Odd drot em

 An Jack o t Slade were theer as weel
 An Joe o Abes thro Waerley
 An Lijah off o t Lavver Hill
 Were passin th ale raand rarely
 Thro raand an square they seemed to meet
 To hear or tell a story
 But t gem o all I heeard last neet
 Were one by Doad o t Glory

 He bet his booits at it were true
 An all seemed to believe him
 Though if he lost he neednt rue
 But t wodnt done to grieve him
 His uncle lived it Pudsey taan
 An practised local praichin
 An if he re lucky he were baan
 To start a schooil for taichin

 But he were takken vary ill
 He felt his time were comin
 They say he browt it on hissel
 Wi studyin his summin
 He called his wife an neighbours in
 To hear his deein sarmon
 An telled em if they lived i sin
 Their lot d be a warm un

 Then turnin raand unto his wife
 Said Mal tha knaws owd craytur
 If Id been blest wi longer life
 I might hae left things straighter
 Joe Sooithill owes me eighteen pence
 I lent it him last lovefeast
 Says Mall He hasnt lost his sense
 Thank God for that at least

 An Ben o t top o t bank tha knows
 We owe him one paand ten
 Just hark says Mally theer he goes
 Hes ramellin agean
 Dont tak a bit o notice folk
 You see poor thing hes ravin
 It cuts me up to hear sich talk
 Hes spent his life i savin

 An Mally lass he said agean
 Tak heed o my direction
 T schooil owes me hauf a craan I mean
 My share o t last collection
 Thall see to that an have whats fair
 When my poor life is past
 Says Mally Listen I declare
 Hes sensible at last

 He shut his een and sank to rest
 Death seldom claimed a better
 They put him by bud what were t best
 He sent em back a letter
 To tell em all haa hed goan on
 An haa he gate to enter
 An gav em rules to act upon
 If iver they sud ventur

 Saint Peter stood wi keys i hand
 Says he What do ye want sir
 If to go in you understand
 Unknown to me you cant sir
 Pray whats your name Where are ye thro3
 Just make your business clear
 Says he They call me Parson Drew
 Ive come thro Pudsey here

 Yeve come thro Pudsey do ye say
 Dont try sich jokes on me sir
 Ive kept these doors too long a day
 I cant be fooled by thee sir
 Says Drew I wodnt tell a lie
 For t sake o all theres in it
 If yeve a map o England by
 Ill show you in a minute

 So Peter gate a timetable
 They gloord4 ower t map together
 An Drew did all at he were able
 But couldnt find it either
 At last says he Theres Leeds Taan Hall
 An there stands Bradfords Mission
 Its just between them twothats all
 Your maps an old edition

 Bud theer it isIll lay a craan
 An if yeve niver knawn it
 Yeve missd a bonny Yorkshire taan
 Though monny be at scorn it
 He oppend t gate says he Its time
 Somebody coomIll trust thee
 Thall find inside no friends o thine
 Thart first ats coom thro Pudsey

Pateley Reaces 1874

 Anonymous

 From The Nidderdill Olminao 1875
 edited by Nattie Nidds Pateley Bridge

 Attention all baith great an small
 An doant screw up your feaces
 While I rehearse i simple verse
 A count o Pateley Reaces

 Fra all ower moors they com by scores
 Girt skelpin1 lads an lasses
 An cats an dogs an coos an hogs
 An horses mules an asses

 Awd foaks were thar fra near an far
 At couldnt fairly hopple
 An laffin brats as wild as cats
 Ower heeads an heels did topple

 The Darley lads arrived i squads
 Wi smiles all ower their feaces
 An Hartwith youths wi screwedup mooths
 In wonder watched the reaces

 Fra Menwith Hill and Folly Gill
 Thorngat an Deacon Paster
 Fra Thruscross Green an t Heets Were seen
 Croods coomin thick an faster

 Tween Bardin Brigg and Threshfield Rig
 Awd Wharfedeale gat a thinnin
 An Gerston plods2 laid heavy odds
 On Creaven Lass for winnin

 Sich lots were seen o Hebdin Green
 Ready sean on i t mornin
 While Aptrick chaps i carts and traps
 Were off to Pateley spornin3

 All Greenho Hill past Coddstones kill4
 Com toltherin5 an singin
 Harcastle coves like sheep i droves
 Awd Palmer Simp were bringin

 Baith short an tall past Gowthit Hall
 Tup dealers kept on steerin
 For neer before roond Middles Moor
 Had there been sich a clearin

 All kinds and sorts o games an sports
 Had Pateley chaps provided
 An weel did t few their business do
 At ower em all persided

 Twad tak a swell a munth to tell
 All t ins an t oots o t reaces
 Hoo far they ran which horses wan
 An which were backd for pleaces

 Awd Billy Broon lost hauf a croon
 Wi TatyHawker backin
 For Green Crag flew ower t hurdles true
 An wan t match like a stockin

 An Creaven Lass won lots o brass
 Besides delightin t Brockils
 An Eva dancd an reard and prancd
 An gif6 she stood o cockles

 But t donkey reace were star o t pleace
 For awd an young observers
 Twad meade a nun fra t convent run
 An neer again be nervous

 Tom Hemp fra t Stean cried oot Weel dean
 An t wife began o chaffin
 Whal Kirby Jack stack up his back
 An nearly brast wi laffin

 Sly Wilsill Bin fra een to chin
 Were plaisterd up wi toffy
 An langleg Jane he browt frae t Plain
 Full bent on winnin t coffee

 Young pronsy7 flirts i drabbld skirts
 Like painted peeacocks stritches8
 While girt chignons like milkincans
 On their topgarrits perches

 Fat Sal fra t Knott scarce gat to t spot
 Afore she lost her bustle
 Which sad mishap quite spoild her shap
 An meade her itch an hustle

 Lile pugnosed Nell fra Kettlewell
 Com in her Dolly Vardin
 All frilld an starchd she proodly marchd
 Wi squintin Joe fra Bardin

 Thare cuffs an falls tunics an shawls
 An fancy pollaneeses
 All sham displays ower tatterd stays
 An hardworn raggd chemises

 Thare mushroom fops fra fields an shops
 Fine cigarettes were sookin
 An lots o youths wi beardless mooths
 All kinds o pipes were smookin

 An when at last the sports were past
 All heamward turnd their feaces
 To neer relent at eer they spent
 A day wi Pateley Reaces

Play Cricket 1909

 Ben Turner

 Whativer task you tackle lads
 Whativer job you do
 I all your ways
 I all your days
 Be honest through an through
 Play cricket

 If claads oppress you wi their gloom
 An t sun seems lost to view
 Dont fret an whine
 Ask t sun to shine
 An dont o livin rue
 Play cricket

 If youre i debt dont growl an grunt
 An wish at others had
 T same want o luck
 But show more pluck
 An neer mak others sad
 Play cricket

 If in your days theres chonce to do
 Good deeds then reight an fair

 An say youn1 done your share
 Play cricket

 Weve all a row to hoe thats true
 Lets do it best we can
 Its nobbut once
 We have the chonce
 To play on earth the man

 Belang her sure it mun
 Her smile is sweet as roses

 Though bays be varry weel

 Cause hed made sich a pigsty o t place
 An Summer leuked raand when hed flit

 But Spring says Its my job is this

 An leave me to fettle up here
 An sitha
 Shoos donned a owd appron an tucked up her sleaves

 At them floors bides a bit of a scrub
 Tha knaws t flegstuns mun ha been bad
 When she teems1 aat all t wotter i t tub

 When shoo gets hod o t long brush an sweeps aat them chamers

 To tell her thy mind tha mun wait
 Whol shoos getten things ready for t missis

 Aye Summer is t roses awn queen
 An shoo sits i her state grandly dressed
 But Springs twice as bonny agean
 When shoos donned hersen up i her best

Heam Sweet Heam 1914

 When oft at neet I wanders heame
 To cosy cot an busy deame
 My hardest days wark seems but leet
 When I can get back heame at neet
 My wife an bairns to sit besaade
 Aroond my awn bit firesaade
 What comfort theres i steep1 for me
 A laatle prattler on my knee
 What tales I have to listen tea
 But just at fost theres sike todea
 As niver was Each laatle dot
 Can fain agree for t favrite spot
 Sike problems they can set for me
 T wad puzzle waaser heeads mebbe
 An questions hawf a scoor they ask
 To answer em wad prove a task
 For laatle thowts stray far away
 To things mysterious oot o t way
 An then sike toffer2 they torn oot
 An pratty lips begin to poot
 If iverythings nut stowed away
 To cumulate frae day to day
 Sike treasures they could niver spare
 But gether mair an mair an mair
 In ivery pocket Ive nea doot
 Theyve things they think the wold aboot
 An when their bedtaames drawin nigh
 Wi heavy heead an sleepy eye
 Its vary laatle din they mak
 But slyly try a nap to tak
 An when on t lats3 theyve gone aboon
 I fills my pipe an sattles do on
 To have a comfortable smewk
 An then at t news I has a lewk
 Or hods a bit o talk wi t wife
 The praade an comfort o my life
 Cawd winds may blaw an snawflakes flee
 An neets may be beath lang an dree
 Or it may rain an rain agean
 Sea lang as Ive my days wark dean
 I wadnt swap my humble heame
 For bigger hoose or finer neame
 If all could as contented be
 Thered be mair joy an less misry

 But I neer could fairly see

 Could hae bred a chap like me

 But they gate it wilta shalta

 To change their fleeblown notions

Owd England

 From Tykes Abrooad W Nicholson Wakefield 1911

 Walter Hampson

 Thart welcome thrice welcome Owd England
 It maks my een sparkle wi glee
 An does mi heart gooid to behold thee
 For I know thas a welcome for me
 Let others recaant all thi failins
 Let traitors upbraid as they will
 I know at thy virtues are many
 An my hearts beeatin true to thee still

 Theres a gladness i t sky at bends ower thee
 Theres a sweetness i t green o thy grass
 Theres a glory i t waves at embrace thee
 An thy beauty theres naan can surpass
 Thy childer enrich ivry valley
 An add beauty to ivry glen
 For thas mothered a race o fair women
 An truehearted practical men

 Theres one little spot up i Yorkshire
 Its net mich to crack on at t best
 But to me its a kingdom most lovely
 An it holds t warmest place i my breast
 Compared wi that kingdom all others
 Are worthless as bubbles o fooam
 For one thing my rovin has towt me
 An that is theres no place like hooam

 I know therell be one theer to greet me
 Ats proved faithful through many dark days
 An little feet runnin to meet me
 An een at1 howd love i their gaze
 An theres neighbours both hooamly an kindly
 An mates at are worthy to trust
 An friends my adversitys tested
 At proved to be generous an just

 An net far away theres green valleys
 An greeat craggy towerin hills
 An breezes at mingle their sweetness
 Wi t music o sparklin rills
 An meadows all decked wi wildflaars
 An hedges wi blossom all white
 An a blue sky wheer t skylark is singin
 Just to mak known his joy an delight

 Aye England Owd England I love thee
 Wi a love at each day grows more strong
 In my heart tha sinks deeper an deeper
 As year after year rolls along
 An spite o thy faults an thy follies
 Whativer thy fortune may be
 I storm or i sunshine i weal or i woe
 Thall allus be lovely to me

 May thy sons an thy dowters live happy
 An niver know t woes o distress
 May thy friends be for iver increeasin
 An thy enemies each day grow less
 May tha niver let selfish ambition
 Dishonour or tarnish thy swoord
 But use it alooan agean despots
 Whether reignin at hooam or abrooad

 1 The text of this version of the Lykewake Dirge follows with slight
 variations that found in Mr Richard Blakeboroughs Wit Character
 Folklore and Customs of the North Riding p 123 where the following
 account is given I cannot say when or where the Lyke Walke dirge was
 sung for the last time in the North Riding but I remember once talking
 to an old chap who remembered it being sung over the corpse of a distant
 relation of his a native of Kildale This would be about 1800 and he
 told me that Lykewakes were of rare occurrence then and only heard of
 in outoftheway places  There are other versions of the song the
 one here given is as it was dictated to me There is another version in
 the North Riding which seems to have been written according to the tenets
 of Rome at least I imagine so as purgatory takes the place of hellish
 flames as given above In the Appendix to this volume will be found
 the other version with the introduction of purgatory to which Mr
 Blakeborough refers I have taken it from Sir Walter Scotts Border
 Minstrelsy ed Henderson vol ii pp 1702 but it also finds a
 place in John Aubreys Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme 16867
 preserved among the Lansdowne MSS in the British Museum Aubrey
 prefixes the following note to his version of the dirge The beliefe in
 Yorkeshire was amongst the vulgar perhaps is in part still that after
 the persons death the soule went over Whinnymoore and till about
 161624 at the funerale a woman came like a Praefica and sang the
 following song Further information about this interesting dirge and
 its parallels in other literatures will be found in Hendersons edition
 of the Border Minstrelsy p 163 and in J C Atkinsons Glosary of the
 Cleveland Dialect p 595

 When t streeam runs dry an t deead leaves fall

 An t blood wi lithin3 seems fair cloggd

 When t een grows dim an folk draw nigh
 frae t other saade o t grave
 Its late to square up awd accoonts
 a gannin sowl to save

 T priest may coom an t priest may gan

 When t deeathsmear clems a wrinkled broo

 Nea book nea canle bell nor mass

 When t dree neet cooms can patch a sowl

 T were a dree neet a dree neet
