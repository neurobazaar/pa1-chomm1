Dear Michael Hart and Project Gutenberg

This text comes over a little odd in ASCII Like MONDO2000
the zine we made infamous this book relies on its wacked
layout and bizarre illustrations for much of its meaning not
to say charm

And it was difficult to figure what should be considered the
first chapter for obvious reasons I think the first
chapter really includes Section II
but never mind Here it is the beginning of

 INTRODUCTION to The Real Cyberpunk Fakebook 
 by Bruce Sterling 
 A Renowned Cyberpunk Writer 
 


I like this book so much that Im thinking of changing
my name to StErling You couldnt ask for better guides to
faking cyberpunk than these two utterly accomplished Bay Area
fraudsters These two characters are such consummate boho
hustlers that they make Aleister Crowley look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm

I dont believe in smart drugs and Ive never believed
in smart drugs but I do believe the following Its
genuinely useful to society to have some small contained
fraction of reckless fools who are willing to consume
untested and unknown devices and substances Sure most of
them will have their hearts explode or break out into great
purple bleeding thalidomide warts But who knows maybe
someday one of these jaspers will be eating handfuls of
psychoactive crap out of some hippie pharmacy and he or she
will suddenly learn to read Japanese in the original in six
days Thats not at all likely but it could happen grant me the
possibility

The only drawback to this decentralized libertarian
freemarket regime of biomedical research is that you have to
be ruthlessly prepared to sacrifice certain people just
write em off basically like a cageful of control hamsters
down at the NIMH And if I ever met a man uniquely suited to
this particular cuttingedge role in life it is RU Sirius R U
Sirius basically resembles Gomez Addams in a purple
fedora with an Andy Warhol badge pinned to the brim The
moment I met RU I felt a strong need to pith him and
examine his viscera Im sure there are many other freelance
biomedical researchers who will feel the same intellectual
impulse Read this book and youll see what I mean

Then theres this saint person Never draw to an inside
straight Never eat at a place called Moms And never eat
a bag of ephedrine and a pumpkin pie the whip of
vegetables from a California blonde who doesnt even have
a real name This female personage is so appallingly cagey
that even her main squeeze delights in cryptographically
baffling the NSA If Pat Buchanan ever gets his notso
secret wish and sets up a domestic American gulag for
counterculture thoughtcriminals the Judesters gonna be
way way up on the list maybe even number two right after Bob Dobbs
 Her trials likely to prove rather
interesting however as she only commits crimes in areas
of social activity that havent even been defined yet much
less successfully criminalized A serious legal study of
this womans spectrum of activities would be like a CATscan
of the American unconscious

Theres also Bart Nagel who is too nice a guy to be in the
company of these people

Almost everything in this swell book is completely true
Except for everything about me And my closest co
conspirators We actual cyberpunks by this I mean science
fiction writers dammit the people for whom the cword was
invented the people who were professionally ahead of our
time and were cyberpunks twelve years ago we never sneer
and we never dress like God forbid Tom Wolfe We just
laugh at inappropriate times like when testifying in
Congress and we dress and act just like industrial design
professors

I hope this brief intro clears up any confusion If you
have any trouble at all with this book take full advantage
of your online d00dship and send email Dont be afraid to
ask stupid questions thats what the Internet is for
Ask nice big broad openended questions Stuff like Im
doing a term paper so please tell me everything you know
about cyberspace or Im cyberpunk fan from Bulgaria and
Enlgish not too good but please say more what is about
Virtual Reality

Just dont send the email to me of course Send email
to them After this book they deserve it I feel sure that
youll get prompt answers that will surprise you

These are terms that are defined in Building

baffles you

Sometimes theres a doubleanglebraceenclosed term in the
text that refers to a chapter subheading and then you
must practice your haqr smarts in order to find it
If all else fails you could ask Bruce Sterling at his
secret email address bruceswellcom He will know

THE SHURIKEN AWARDS

We may sometimes succumb to the temptation to rate things the
way snotty critics do by awarding stars However we will
award them as shuriken a cyber kinda star

   
  X   X   X 
 v v v

A shuriken is a throwing star a shinysteel sharpedged
sharppointed weapon from Japan which is cyberpunks
original home in certain misty urban legends The shuriken
itself as an assault weapon would rate onehalf shuriken on a
scale of four A hydrogen bomb would rate five shuriken
You get the idea

Occasionally we may add Propeller Beanies to the Shuriken

 o o o
 ____ ____ ____
 _____ _____ _____

This indicates nerdly interest over and above a cyberpunk
rating Propeller head is an ancient term for nerd
The real name for that key on the Macintosh is not COMMAND
but PROPELLER and this is why

 THE

 REAL

 CYBERPUNK

 FAKEBOOK



 By St Jude RUSirius and Bart Nagel









 SECTION I 
 CYBERPUNKWHY 
 Okay HOW 
 




Chapter 1
CYBERPUNK A CHALLENGING POSTMODERN LIFESTYLE CHOICE
 Why Bother Big Wins and Unexpected Smallstuff


Cyberpunk is extremely hip Being extremely hip is the last
hope for people with no money and no power Being hip gets
you big wins in the status game Hipness can crush your
enemies and attract the apposite sex Best of all cyberpunk
is the next big thing AFTER the next big thing You can hop
on the cyberpunk bandwagon and coast for a long long time
Think of the money youll save on wardrobe updates The
worry youll save on lifestyle decisions

Cyberpunk has not yet been coopted In fact this handbook
is the very first exploitation of this hip new underground
trend This is the ground floor Get in on it



Chapter 2 ACHIEVING CYBERPUNK
 Being It or Faking It


What is there to know about being a cyberpunk Leather
jacket mirrorshades that just about does it right This
kind of patronizing shirt must farking DIE

Since we cant afford to offend any parental units who might
purchase this book for their family circle all chancy verbs
and nouns have been cleverly encyphered This is in the
spirit of true cyberpunkhood see Encryption

You think cyberpunk is just a leather jacket some chrome
studs and fully reflective sunglasses You think thats all
there is Hah You can find those on Kansas City bikers and
the whole California Highway Patrol The true cyberpunk
might tuck a cellularmodem laptop under a spiked leather
arm and a laser pointer in the upper zip pocket Or a true cyberpunk may
look just like YOU But sHe who knows
doesnt tell and hirm who tells doesnt know

Pronoun disclaimer
All pronouns in this book started life as intact males
he his and him If anything bad happened to them
afterwards blame it on the Riot Grrrls Bobbitt Squad

The lifestyle and goals of the true cyberpunk are carefully
guarded secrets in a life totally devoted to coolness and
secrecy We will PIERCE THE VEIL and REVEAL those SECRETS
We will display for you the INNER CYBERPUNK We will give
you everything you need to know about embarking on this
challenging lifestyle When you have read to the end of this
EASY handbook if you DONT pass the hipness quiz well
just read it again But turn your TV up louder



Chapter 3 A STYLE GUIDE TO THE CYBERTYPES
 Recognizing Them and Fitting In


While a cyberpunk is commonly a middleclass white male with way too many
electrons there are varieties of cyberpunk Underlying all the types and
genres is Basic Cyber Style which breaks down to physical gear and mental
attitude

Basic Cyberpunk Gear
is simple Black leather jacket Boots Mirrorshades Laser pointer We
dont know why all cyberpunks need a laser pointer but its mandatory
 Well give you a more elaborate guide to basic cyberpunk gear Later

The Basic Cyberpunk Attitude
is quiet assurance Subdued swashbuckling Maybe a little menace

With these cyberpunk basics you can navigate through all the subgenres But
if you want to pass as a native in a particular cyber subscene without
getting jeered at or beaten up you gotta accessorize and pay close
attention to detail

Motorpsycho Maniacs
Cyberbikers pack the mystique of both worlds high tech and big greasy loud
engines Standard cyberpunk costume is ideal for riding motorcycles and a
mirrorshades helmet is a big plus for the cyber look mega robotic coolness
 Motorcycles are dangerous and can kill you This is also cool

Goths Deathcore and VampireWannabes
Ideally for this subscene you should know about The Cure
which is a band To fit in grow your hair big and dye it
blueblack Spray it with Aquanet White to make it stick
out medusalike Go to a kidshop and buy plastic fangs
The kind that glow in the dark are funny Funny is NOT the
object here All sexes should wear a Victorian shirt
blouse white or black only that gapes to show flesh You
must practice looking tormented tall and thin The ideal is
chalkwhite face makeup with blueblack eyesockets Blueblack
makeup with white eyesockets is untested but might work very
well if you avoid a minstrel look At all times think
intensity and torment Tormentand ironic bitterness No
giggling or snickering no kidding

Riot Grrrls
These are fierce girls who like tech This is a sexist
category but there we are girls only A grrrl can be
called d00d and guy at all times but a nonfemale guy
is not a grrrl This is just the way things are
If youre a grrrl you can wear anything you want to
because youre there to defend it This is true for anybody
really look as tough as you wanta be and be ready to back
it up Fierce is good Grrrls with tech expertise are
irresistible NOTHING is more attractive than a fierce
blazing ninjatype grrrl right now and if she knows UNIX
or phonefreeking the world is hers Hrrrs

TechnopagansRaversNeohippies
Dont worry about this one This scene is free loving
noncomforming spontaneous You can dress any old way
and fit right in
Unless you dont look cool

Maybe you should stick to basic cyberpunk Dancing in
leather is hot as hck but sweating is better than not
looking cool Noncyber ravers favor floppy hats five
kinds of plaid n paisley and multiple organ piercings
They sometimes take raver drugs These drugs make you fonder
of other people than you really want to be The morning
after Revulsion hangovers can be nasty In this scene
pretending to be on raver drugs is recommended and easy
too Unfocus your eyes and smile lovingly In black leather
you wont have to worry so much about getting hugged

Academic CyberWannabes
Students teachers whatever dress down Like youre always
en route to a garage salemaybe to donate what youre
wearing Casual Jeans black leather jacket laser
pointer No tweed notice and no Birkenshtocken If you
flash paperbacks by Arthur Kroker Paul Virilio and Jean
Baudrillard it means youre serious Paperbacks by Mark
Leyner and Kathy Acker means youre way past serious

Cybercowboysgrrrls
Some of these people come from Texas or Oklahoma In this crew to yr
cyberbasics you add a cowboy hat cowboy boots and grow any hair youve got
really LONG Males should try to get hair somewhere on their faces

Science Fiction Writers
Fullsteam straightahead hard edge with a permanent sneer Just to twist
heads some males writers go for the Tom Wolfe effete look blue blazer and
wingtips Still they sneer

Web Crawlers and Other Bourgeois Types
You dont really care about this one do you You do Subscribe to WIRED
 Next

Deep Geek
Supernerds Hackers Wizards Phone Phreakers
Things get difficult here Deep geekware is unstandard
 Very heavy Wizards can look like accountants or like
streetpeople Facial hair and Goodwill Casual happen a lot
 Chubby happens too since these guys dont do enough
dancing in leather pants To get along in this scene you
really need to be very smart very funny or very sexy To
work yourself up to smart at least learn UNIX Or carry
the 2600 zine in your back pocket and read that Practice
being technical But until you get good wear your
cyberbasics and never leave home without your laser pointer
This will draw the admiration of people who dont know any
better which has its own rewards Leading us inevitably to
the final category

Phonies Poseurs and Pretenders
Taking the Easy Way In
Dont think scheme Forget about reading books buy no
computers or widgets Dont do or buy anything Save all
your money for clothes and art materials Make your
girlboyfriend help you assemble your hitek models youre
gonna need mockups of a laptop computer a personal
communicator a beeper maybe even a fake stungun Realism
is key Then wear them all with attitude Youre better
than real Strut Sneer Remember the 3 disses distrust
disrespect distroy Wait thats not right is it

We know there are going to be mutterings about this category
Grumblings that being a poseur is not as easy as we think
A poseur has a lot of overhead in worry just for starts
what if youre exposed as a clueless And staying locked
to the HOTWIRED Website to catch what you should be
imitating Dang

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
