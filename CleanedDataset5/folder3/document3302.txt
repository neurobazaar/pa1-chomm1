men to jail

JIM I dont know Maybe so I got tired of looking for it

MRS AUSTIN I might help you if you would let me

JIM I aint asking any help

MRS AUSTIN No but Im offering it After a pause Have you been
doing this sort of thing very long

MRS AUSTIN How long

JIM After hesitation This is my first job

MRS AUSTIN What You dont mean that

JIM It happens to be true maam

MRS AUSTIN What made you do it

JIM Its a long story

MRS AUSTIN Tell it to me

JIM It aint just a good time for story telling

MRS AUSTIN You are afraid of me I have no quarrel with you I dont
care anything for the things you have in the bag and besides I
suppose you wont take them now Im only sorry to see a man going
wrong and Id like to help if I could Ill play fair I give you my
word of honor

JIM There aint much honor in this business

MRS AUSTIN No I suppose not But you can trust me Put up that gun

JIM Youll let me go when I want to No tricks

MRS AUSTIN I give you my word

JIM All right Im a fool I guess but Ill trust you Puts
revolver in pocket Sit down maam It must be cold for you This is
a queer kind of layout for a burglar Sits opposite her You heard
that racket I made in the other room

MRS AUSTIN Yes What was it

JIM Some kind of a jar

MRS AUSTIN Oh my Greek vase Well never mind it was an
imitation What were you doing

JIM I was looking for something to eat

MRS AUSTIN Oh

JIM It would have been the first thing Ive had since the day before
yesterday

MRS AUSTIN Whats the matter

JIM No work A pause I suppose youll give me the old gag
theres plenty of work for a man thats willing

MRS AUSTIN No I happen to have studied and I know better than
that Else I should have fainted when I saw you instead of
sitting here talking to you Do you drink

JIM Yes but I didnt use to Any man would drink that went
through what I did

MRS AUSTIN Are you married

JIM Yes I was married My wife is dead

MRS AUSTIN Any children

JIM Two Both dead

MRS AUSTIN Oh

JIM It aint a pretty story maam Its a poor mans story

MRS AUSTIN Tell it to me

JIM All right Itll spoil your sleep for the rest of the night I
guess but you can have it A pause A year ago I was what they call
an honest working man I had a home and a happy family and I didnt
drink any too much and I did well even if the work was hard I
was in the steel works here in town

MRS AUSTIN Startled The Empire Steel Company

JIM Yes Why

MRS AUSTIN Nothing only I happen to know some people there Go
on

JIM Its no childs work there maam Theres an awful lot of
accidents more than the world has any idea of Ive seen a man
sent to hell in the snapping of a finger And they dont treat them
fair they hush things up There are things you wouldnt believe
if I told them to you

MRS AUSTIN Tell them

JIM Ive seen a man there get caught in one of the cranes They
stopped the machinery but they couldnt get him out Theyd have had
to take the crane apart and that would have cost several days and it
was rush time and the man was only a poor Hunkie and there was no
one to know or care So they started up the crane and cut his leg
off

MRS AUSTIN Oh horrible

JIM Its the sort of thing you couldnt believe unless you saw it
But I saw it I didnt care though I was a fool And then my time
came

MRS AUSTIN How do you mean

JIM A blast furnace blew out and a piece of slag hit me here where
you see that patch If it wasnt for the patch youd see something
that would make you sick It was a pain you couldnt tell about
it was a couple of days before I knew where I was And the first thing
when I came to my senses in the hospital it was there was
a lawyer chap with a paper waiting for me

MRS AUSTIN In agitation A lawyer

JIM Yes maam Company representative you know And I was to sign
the paper it was a receipt for the hospital expenses the
operation and all that you see they had to take out what was
left of my eye And of course I couldnt see I had to sign where
he told me to And when I got well I found they had trapped me into
signing a release

MRS AUSTIN A release

JIM I had accepted the hospital expenses as a release for all the
company owed me And I couldnt get any damages and my eye was
gone and all the weeks without any wages

MRS AUSTIN My God

JIM And they turned me out so weak I could hardly walk and

MRS AUSTIN Greatly excited Who was this man

JIM Which

MRS AUSTIN This lawyer

JIM I never heard his name He was a young fellow handsome
smoothfaced

MRS AUSTIN Whispering Oh

JIM Ah they dont mind it theyre smooth They do that all the
time Its what they get their pay for

MRS AUSTIN Covering her face with her hands Oh stop

JIM Whats the matter

MRS AUSTIN Looking up with white face Nothing Go on

JIM It was two months before I could work at all And the rent came
due and they turned us out it was wintertime and my wife
caught a cold and it turned to pneumonia and she died Thats all of
that

MRS AUSTIN Go on

JIM And then you see the panic came and the mills shut down
sudden as that The lawyer told me the company would see I always
had a job but that was only to get me to sign

MRS AUSTIN Feverishly Did you try him

JIM I went to the office and tried but they wouldnt even let me see
him

MRS AUSTIN I see And then

JIM Then I went out to look for work I had the two babies you know
 and God only knows how I loved those babies I said Id fight
and win out for their sakes But Amy she was the little one
she never had been very strong When youre a poor man you cant
get the best food even if you know what it is It aint fit milk they
sell for the children in this city and the baby died I never
knew what was the matter exactly And there was only one left
and me tramping the streets all day looking for a job How was I to
take care of him lady How could I have helped it His voice is
breaking with emotion And oh maam he was the loveliest little
fellow with hair like gold And so well and strong

MRS AUSTIN Whispering What happened to him

JIM A street car killed him

MRS AUSTIN Oh

JIM Run over his chest maam I came home at night and they told
me and I near went out of my mind Can you think what it was to see
him with his eyes starting out of his head like and his
beautiful little body all mashed flat

MRS AUSTIN Wildly Oh spare me

JIM I told you it wouldnt be a pretty story Do you think maybe you
wouldnt take to drink if you saw a sight like that Sinking back
Since then Ive looked for work but I havent cared much Only
sometimes Ive thought Id like to meet that young lawyer

MRS AUSTIN Starting up Oh

JIM Yes it all began with him But I dont know theyd only
jug me Anyway tonight I was sitting in a saloon with two fellows
that I had met One of them was a secondstory man a fellow that
climbs up porches and fireescapes And I heard him telling about a
haul hed made and I said to myself Theres a job for me Ill
be a secondstory man And I tried it but you see I didnt do
very well Im not good for much I guess any more

AUSTIN Enters left revolver in hand stands watching unobserved
Good heavens

MRS AUSTIN You cant tell You may have better success than you look
for

JIM No theres nothing can help me Im for the scrap heap

MRS AUSTIN Eagerly Wait and see You are a man you can be
helped yet

AUSTIN Coming forward What does this mean

JIM Starts wildly and reaches for revolver Ha

AUSTIN Raising weapon Holdup your hands

MRS AUSTIN Rushing forward No Stop

AUSTIN What do you mean

MRS AUSTIN I say stop I promised him his freedom

AUSTIN My dear

MRS AUSTIN Give me the weapon

AUSTIN Why

MRS AUSTIN Give it to me Takes revolver Now sit down

JIM Has been staring wildly at AUSTIN My God its the lawyer
fellow

MRS AUSTIN Yes it is he

AUSTIN What does all this mean

MRS AUSTIN Look at this man

AUSTIN Staring Why

MRS AUSTIN Dont you know him

AUSTIN No

MRS AUSTIN Look carefully Turns up light Have you never seen him
before

AUSTIN Never that I can recall What is his name

MRS AUSTIN I dont know To JIM What is it

JIM Humph Hesitating He could find out anyway Jim Faraday

AUSTIN Faraday it sounds familiar

JIM Grimly Youve served the trick on a good many I guess

AUSTIN To Mrs AUSTIN What does he mean

JIM Dont you remember the Sisters Hospital The fellow that had his
eye burned out in the big explosion

AUSTIN Startled Oh

JIM Sneeringly Ah yes

AUSTIN You are the man

JIM Im the man

MRS AUSTIN Harvey you took this man some paper to sign

AUSTIN Yes I remember

MRS AUSTIN Did you tell him what was in it

AUSTIN Hesitates Why

MRS AUSTIN Answer me please

AUSTIN Why my dear

MRS AUSTIN Did you tell him what was in it

AUSTIN But my dear it wasnt my business to tell him

MRS AUSTIN Oh

AUSTIN I was representing the company

MRS AUSTIN I see

AUSTIN It was his place to see what was in it

MRS AUSTIN Harvey This man with one eye burned out and not yet
over the accident

AUSTIN My dear you dont understand

JIM Wildly You didnt leave me to find out for myself You lied to
me

MRS AUSTIN At least you permitted him to be misled You did not tell
him the honest truth about the paper and what would be the effect if
he signed it

AUSTIN My dear you do not understand I could not have done that I
was the representative of the interests of the company

MRS AUSTIN And that is the sort of work you do for them

AUSTIN That is the sort of work that has to be done I cannot help
it much as I would like to

MRS AUSTIN Wildly You have done that sort of thing before And
you will do it again

AUSTIN My dear

MRS AUSTIN And you take money for it You bring that money home to
me And you never told me how you got it You make me sharer in your
guilt

AUSTIN Helen

MRS AUSTIN This was how you earned your promotion This was what you
came to me and boasted about This was what we married on This money
 blood money that you get for cheating this helpless
laborer out of his rights out of everything he had in the world

AUSTIN My dear you are out of your mind You do not understand
business

MRS AUSTIN I understand it all a child could understand It is
only you the rising young lawyer that doesnt understand
Harvey Harvey Do you know what you have done to this man what
you and I together have done to him We have wrecked his life We have
driven him to hell We have murdered his wife and his two children We
have turned him into a tramp and a criminal We have climbed to
success on top of him we have made our fortune out of his blood
This house this furniture these pictures all this
beauty and comfort all this we have coined out of his tears and
agony out of the lives of his sick wife and his two little
babies And you have done this for me you have made me the cause
of it you have put the guilt of it upon my young life a
thing that I must carry through the world with me until I die

AUSTIN Starting toward her Helen

MRS AUSTIN No Dont touch me Speak to HIM It is with him you have
to do What have you to say to him Dont think about me

AUSTIN My dear be reasonable

MRS AUSTIN What have you to say to him That is what I want to know
Harvey Dont you understand it is your character that is up for
judgment

AUSTIN It cant be as bad as you say

MRS AUSTIN Why cant it Find out

AUSTIN After a long pause turns to Jim Faraday

JIM Well

AUSTIN Is what my wife says true

JIM Its true

AUSTIN You got no damages from the company

JIM Didnt you fix it yourself What do they pay you for

AUSTIN And had you no money saved

JIM My family had to live on it

AUSTIN And didnt you get your job back

JIM Until the shutdown I did

AUSTIN Oh thats so I forgot that

JIM Humph

AUSTIN Thats too bad I will have to do something for you

JIM Will that bring my wife and babies back to life

AUSTIN Oh your family died My God thats terrible A pause
Faraday I cant help that What can I do Listen man you see
how unhappy my wife is you dont want to make the thing
impossible for me do you

JIM I aint doing anything

AUSTIN Be reasonable and let me atone for the mistake Well say
nothing about this about tonight Well start over and Ill see
that you get a good job and a fair chance

Jim Humph

AUSTIN Will you do that Im honestly sorry about it And perhaps if
I can give you some money for a start

Takes out purse

JIM Put up your money It aint likely youve got as much there as
Id have got from the company

AUSTIN Oh is that it Well maybe that is fair Ill fix it up with
you on that basis

JIM And what about the other fellows hey

AUSTIN The other fellows

JIM That youve done out the same way you done me What about Dan
Kearney that lost his life the day after and you and the rest of
the company sharks fixed it up so that his widow couldnt prove how it
was that he got hurt

MRS AUSTIN Harvey

JIM Yes maam they done that And it aint the first time they done
it either nor the last And theyve bought juries and
judges too I reckon there aint much work of a dirty sort that
the Empire Steel Company aint tried in this city and you can
bet their smart young lawyers know all the game Im sorry for you
lady youre white and Id be glad to help you But Ive seen
too much of the company and its ways and I wont lie down and lick
its hand not for any money I aint so low Ive got the value of
my wife and two little babies figured out and ready to hand I reckon
Ill stay on the outside of the fence and take my chances Ill wind
up in jail I suppose but theres many a better man than me done the
same So I guess Ill go and well call it off

Starts away

MRS AUSTIN Harvey

AUSTIN My dear

MRS AUSTIN Is that all you can say to him You will let him go To
JIM Listen to me You are right We can never undo what we have
done We cannot repay you But at least we must do what we can We
cannot let the evil go on You yourself have no right to do it
you have no right to give up your life

JIM I see what you mean lady and Im sorry for you Id help you if
I could But its too late I know that There cant anybody save
me Im rotten Im a boozer I couldnt stop if I wanted to And
I aint got any reason to want to I aint in the running

MRS AUSTIN Stretching out her arms But what can I do

JIM You can look after them that aint down Look after them that
your husband and the rest of the companys sharks will do up tomorrow

MRS AUSTIN No

JIM Oh theyll do it I know what you mean youll make him
stop but theyll have another man in his place Its a machine
 it goes right on Yes and you wont do as much as you think you
will either youll think it over and you wont go as far as
you mean to now

MRS AUSTIN No No

JIM Ah but you cant help it youre in the mill too Its the
class you belong to You can talk and feel sorry but you aint
made to do things You have to have your houses and your fine dresses
 and you couldnt live without them and thered be no use your
trying And that means you have to live off my class you have to
ride on our backs And it dont much matter which part you ride on as
far as I can see Youll make your husband get a new job maybe but
hell do the same thing in another way only you wont find it
out But any way he gets his money itll come out of me and my kind
Dye see I do the work Im the man underneath I make the good
things and you get them A pause Good luck to you

MRS AUSTIN You are cruel

JIM Nothing of the kind Ive just told you the facts I feel sorry
for you Id do anything I could for you Stretching out his hands
See what Ive done Ive given you your husbands life

MRS AUSTIN Oh

JIM Yes just that Youve no idea how many times I swore it
that Id kill him on sight that Id strangle the life out of
him if ever I laid eyes on him again I used to sit when I was half
drunk and brood over it my God I even swore it by the body of
my little boy And Ive got my gun and youve taken his away from
him And I dont shoot him A pause I leave him to you Grimly
You punish him

Exit right

AUSTIN stretches out his arms to his wife She sinks upon the table
burying her head

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
To donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate


Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
