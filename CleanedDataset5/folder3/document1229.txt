We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext

This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users 2001

Preface



This edition of the Select Poems of Sidney Lanier is issued
in the hope of making his poetry known to wider circles than hitherto
especially among the students of our highschools and colleges
To these as to older people the poems will it is believed
prove an inspiration from the standpoint both of literature and of life

The biographical section of the Introduction rests in the main
upon Dr Wards admirable Memorial prefixed to the Poems of Sidney Lanier
edited by his wife though a few additional facts have been gleaned
here and there For most of the Bibliography down to 1888 I am indebted
to my Hopkins comrade Dr Richard E Burton now of Hartford Conn
who compiled one for the Memorial of Sidney Lanier
published by President Gilman of the Johns Hopkins University in 1888
Obligations to other publications about Lanier are in every instance
acknowledged in the appropriate place


 I say most of the Bibliography down to 1888 because Dr Burtons
 different purpose led him to exclude items that could not be omitted
 in a Bibliography that like mine tries to be complete


As to the selections made I wished to include The Marshes of Glynn
and yet not to exclude Sunrise But both could not be put in
and I finally gave the preference to Sunrise chiefly on the ground
of its being Laniers latest complete poem I believe all will admit
that the poems selected fairly exemplify the genius of the poet
The poems are arranged not as in the complete edition
but in their chronological order the only proper one I think
for a textbook Of course they are all given complete


 Later opinion generally agrees that The Marshes of Glynn
 is Laniers greatest poem and as this edition has no limitations of space
 it would be inappropriate to exclude it Therefore it has been inserted
 more or less in chronological order in accordance with Callaways plan
 with some comments  Alan Light 1998


In the Notes I have made rather copious quotations from poems
familiar to English scholars because I hope that this book
will go into the hands of many to whom they are not familiar
and to whom the original texts are not easily accessible
And yet if they at all attain their end the Notes must lead one
to wish to know more of English poetry of which Laniers is but a part

Among the friends that have helped me by counsel or otherwise
I gratefully name Mr Clifford Lanier brother of the poet
Professor Wm Hand Browne of the Johns Hopkins University
Dr Charles H Ross of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute
and my colleagues in the School of English in the University of Texas
Mr L R Hamberlin and Professor Leslie Waggener
Chiefjustice Logan E Bleckley of Georgia a man of letters
as well as of law very kindly put at my use his correspondence with the poet
the original draft of Corn and his criticisms upon the same
My chief indebtedness however is to Mrs Sidney Lanier
who has been most generous with her time and her husbands papers

 Introduction




I A Brief Sketch of Laniers Life

 18421881



Sidney Lanier has so recently passed from us that it seems desirable
briefly to recount the chief incidents of his life This task
is much lightened by Dr Wm Hayes Wards Memorial upon which
as stated in the Preface is based this section of my essay
Born at Macon Ga February 3 1842 Sidney Lanier came of a family
noted for their love and cultivation of the fine arts
From the time of Queen Elizabeth to the Restoration
several of his paternal ancestors were connected with the English court
as musical composers and as painters The father of the poet however
Robert S Lanier was a most industrious lawyer who
after a lingering illness of three years recently answered Adsum
to the summons of the supreme tribunal The poets mother Mary Anderson
a Virginian of Scotch descent likewise sprang from a family
distinguished for their love of oratory music and poetry


 For the full title of works cited see Bibliography
 October 20 1893 at Macon Ga


With such an ancestry we are not surprised to learn that
Sidneys earliest passion was for music and that in boyhood he could
although untutored play on almost every kind of instrument He preferred
the violin in playing which he sometimes sank into a deep trance
but in deference to his fathers view gave it up for the flute
his power over which we shall hear of farther on At first
strange to say he considered music unworthy of ones sole attention
but later he came to rank it as his fullest expression of worship

At fourteen Sidney entered the Sophomore Class of Oglethorpe College
near Macon Ga and with a years intermission graduated with first honor
in 1860 when just eighteen To Professor James Woodrow of Oglethorpe
now President of South Carolina College Lanier declared
that he owed the strongest and most valuable stimulus of his youth
On graduating he was given a tutorship in his Alma Mater
a position that he held until the outbreak of the Civil War

The lectureroom was now exchanged for the battlefield
in April 1861 Lanier entered the Confederate Army as a private
in the Macon Volunteers of the Second Georgia Battalion
an organization among the first to reach Norfolk and that still keeps up
its corporate existence In the spring of 1862 Lanier was joined
by his young brother Clifford and throughout the war
each seemed to vie with the other in brotherly love
for while both were offered promotion neither would accept it
since to do so would have entailed separation from the other
The leisure time of his first years service Sidney spent
in the study of music and the modern languages He was engaged
in several battles in Virginia but afterward was transferred
with Clifford to the Signal Service with headquarters at Petersburg
Here he had access to a small library of which he made sedulous use
In 1863 his company was mounted and served in Virginia and North Carolina
In the spring of 1864 both brothers were transferred to Wilmington
the headquarters of the Marine Signal Service in which they remained
to the end of the war Finally the two brothers were separated
each becoming signal officer of a blockaderunner Sidneys vessel
was captured and for five months he was a prisoner at Point Lookout Md
with nothing but his flute to solace him It was the exposure of prisonlife
no doubt that first led to decline of health by developing
the seeds of consumption a disease that was to carry off his mother
and that he was to struggle with the last fifteen years of his life
Released from prison in February 1865 he returned to Georgia
for the most part afoot and reached home March 15th
An account of his warlife is given in his novel Tigerlilies
treated below


 It is sometimes erroneously stated that each was put in charge
 of a blockaderunner


During the succeeding nine years 186573 his life was checkered indeed
Seriously ill for six weeks he arose from his bed to see
his mother carried off by consumption and to find himself suffering
with congestion of the lungs Slightly relieved Lanier turned his hand
to various projects for making a living clerking in a hotel
in Montgomery Ala for two years writing and publishing his novel
Tigerlilies teaching at Prattville Ala one year during which time
he married Miss Mary Day of Macon Ga studying and then practising law
with his father at Macon Ga for five years now in the winter of 187273
trying to recuperate at San Antonio Texas for hemorrhages had begun in 1868
and a cough had set in two years later and finally settling in Baltimore
December 1873 to devote himself to music and literature


 April 1867
 December 19 1867


Against the sons devotion of his life to music and literature
the father protested chiefly on business grounds and begged him
to rejoin himself in the practice of the law Thanking his father
for his thoughtfulness Lanier justified his own course
in these earnest words My dear father think how for twenty years
through poverty through pain through weariness through sickness
through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical college
and of a bare army and then of an exacting business life
through all the discouragement of being wholly unacquainted
with literary people and literary ways  I say think how
in spite of all these depressing circumstances and of a thousand more
which I could enumerate these two figures of music and poetry
have steadily kept in my heart so that I could not banish them
Does it not seem to you as to me that I begin to have the right
to enroll myself among the devotees of these two sublime arts
after having followed them so long and so humbly and through
so much bitterness1 Of course the father yielded and did all
that his slender means would allow toward keeping up his son
who henceforth devoted every energy to music and literature
Despite continued illhealth which now and again necessitated
visits of months duration to Florida North Carolina and Virginia
Lanier did a vast amount of work He was engaged as first flute
for the Peabody Symphony Concerts a position that he filled
with rare distinction for six years As to his literary work
this began with the publication of his novel Tigerlilies in 1867
and in the same year of occasional poems in The Round Table of New York
Corn published in Lippincotts Magazine Philadelphia
for February 1875 is the first of his poems that attracted general notice
and the one that gained him the friendship of Bayard Taylor
To Taylor he owed his selection to write the Centennial Cantata
which gave him still greater notoriety though to be sure
some of it was not very grateful to him In 1876 the Lippincotts published
his Florida and in 1877 his first volume of Poems
which contained ninetyfour pages and consisted chiefly of pieces2
previously published in the magazines Soon after settling in Baltimore
Lanier made a careful study of Old and Middle English the fruits of which
he partially embodied in courses of lectures given to his private class
and to the public the latter at the Peabody Institute in 1879
During these years too he had been steadily turning out poems of high order
On his birthday February 3 in 1879 he received notice of his appointment
as Lecturer on English Literature at the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore
for the ensuing scholastic year with a fixed salary the first since
his marriage In the summer of 1879 he wrote his Science of English Verse
which constituted the basis of his first course of lectures
at the Johns Hopkins University Notwithstanding serious illness
this same winter 187980 he lectured at three private schools
and kept up his musical engagement at the Peabody Concerts
The next winter 188081 he came near dying but still kept writing
Sunrise was written with a fever temperature of 104 Degrees
and went through his twelve lectures at the Hopkins afterwards embodied
in The English Novel How trying this must have been to him
can be gathered from the following words of Mr Ward
A few of the earlier lectures he penned himself the rest he was obliged
to dictate to his wife With the utmost care of himself
going in a closed carriage and sitting during his lecture
his strength was so exhausted that the struggle for breath
in the carriage on his return seemed each time to threaten the end
Those who heard him listened in a sort of fascinated terror as in doubt
whether the hoarded breath would suffice to the end of the hour3
After this a trip was made to New York to arrange for issuing some books
for boys and four were issued two posthumously Boys Froissart 1878
Boys King Arthur 1880 Boys Mabinogion 1881
and Boys Percy 1882 Another work an account of North Carolina
similar to that of Florida was contracted for and was definitely planned
but owing to aggravating infirmities could not be completed

For the end was near at hand Desperate illness had made it necessary
to seek relief near Asheville NC where he was joined
by Mrs Lanier and by his father and stepmother Growing no better
he was moved to Lynn Polk County NC Of the rest we shall hear
in the words of his wife We are left alone it is August 29 1881
with one another On the last night of the summer comes a change
His love and immortal will hold off the destroyer of our summer
yet one more week until the forenoon of September 7th and then falls
the frost and that unfaltering will renders its supreme submission to
the will of God Unusually checkered his life had been and yet for Lanier
as for Timrod poetry and music had turned lifes tasteless waters
into wine and flushed them through and through with purple tints
The body was taken to Mr Laniers home in Baltimore thence to
the Church of St Michael and All Angels where services were conducted
by the rector the Rev Dr William Kirkus It was then buried
in Greenmount Cemetery in the lot of Mr and Mrs Lawrence Turnbull
two of the dearest friends that Mr and Mrs Lanier had in Baltimore


 Wards Memorial p xxx
 Timrods A Vision of Poesy stanza xliv


Mr Lanier left a family consisting of his wife and four sons
Mrs Lanier who lives at Tryon NC was the inspiration
not only of those glorious tributes Laus Mariae and My Springs
but also of the poets whole life The eldest son Mr Charles Day Lanier
was born at Macon Ga September 12 1868 and was graduated AB
at the Johns Hopkins University in 1888 At one time he was
Assistant Editor of The Cosmopolitan Magazine a position that he gave up
only to become Business Manager of The Review of Reviews
with which he has been connected from its beginning
He is the author of several graceful sketches in the magazines
The second son Sidney is passionately fond of music
and would have devoted himself thereto but for lifelong illhealth
After teaching three years in West Virginia he has started a fruit farm
at Tryon NC where he hopes to build up his health
The third son Henry Wysham was prevented from entering the Johns Hopkins
by a partial failure of sight and for three years has devoted himself
to railroad engineering in Baltimore and in Jamaica The youngest
Robert Sampson only fourteen is at Tryon NC with his mother

That interest in Laniers life and work did not cease with his death
there is abundant evidence On October 22 1881 a memorial meeting was held
by the Faculty and students of the Johns Hopkins University at which
addresses1 were made by President Gilman and Professor Wm Hand Browne
of the University and by the Rev Dr William Kirkus of Baltimore
and a letter1 was read from the poetcritic Edmund C Stedman
of New York In 1883 The English Novel was published
and in 1884 the Poems edited by his wife with the excellent Memorial
by Dr Wm Hayes Ward who declared that he thought Lanier
would take his final rank with the first princes of American song2
Numerous reviews of his life and works were published notably those
by Mr Wm R Thayer Dr Merrill E Gates Professor Charles W Kent
and by the London Spectator On February 3 1888
the Johns Hopkins University held another memorial meeting in Baltimore
attended by many from other cities A bust of the poet in bronze
modelled by Ephraim Keyser sculptor in the last period of Laniers life
at the suggestion of Mr J R Tait was presented to the University
by his kinsman Charles Lanier Esq of New York It was also announced that
a citizen of Baltimore had offered a pedestal to be cut in Georgia marble
from a design by Mr J B N Wyatt On a temporary pedestal
hung the flute of Lanier which had so often been his solace
and a roll of his manuscript music The bust was crowned
with a wreath of laurel the words of Lanier The Time needs Heart
were woven into the strings of a floral lyre and other flowers
likewise brought by personal friends were grouped around the pedestal
As a memento a card designed by Mrs Henry Whitman of Boston
was given to those who were present Upon its face was a wreath
with Laniers name and the date and the motto  Aspiro dum Exspiro
upon the reverse appeared the closing lines of the Hymn of the Sun
taken from the poets Hymns of the Marshes  and beneath
a flute with ivy twined about it3 The exercises
which were interspersed with music were as follows
addresses by President Gilman of the Hopkins and President Gates of Rutgers
now of Amherst selections from Laniers poetry read by
Miss Susan Hayes Ward of Newark NJ a paper on Laniers
Science of English Verse by Professor A H Tolman of Ripon College Wis
now of the University of Chicago poetic tributes by Mrs Lawrence Turnbull
Miss Edith M Thomas and Messrs James Cummings Richard E Burton
and John B Tabb and letters from Messrs Richard W Gilder
Edmund C Stedman and James Russell Lowell  all of which may be found
in President Gilmans dainty Memorial of Sidney Lanier Again
a replica of the abovementioned bust the gift also of Mr Charles Lanier
was unveiled at the poets birthplace Macon Ga on October 17 1890
on which occasion tender tributes4 were again poured forth
in prose and verse by Messrs W B Hill Hugh V Washington
Charles Lanier Clifford Lanier Wm Hand Browne Charles G D Roberts
John B Tabb H S Edwards Wm H Hayne Charles W Hubner
Joel Chandler Harris Charles Dudley Warner and Daniel C Gilman
But more significant than these demonstrations perhaps
is the steadily growing study devoted to Laniers works
Mr Higginson5 tells us for instance that when he wrote his tribute
in 1887 Laniers Science of English Verse had been put
upon the list of Harvard books to be kept only a fortnight
and that according to the librarian it was out literally all the time
Moreover it would not be difficult to cite various poems
that have been more or less modeled upon Laniers it is sufficient perhaps
to point out that the marsh a theme almost unknown to poetry before Lanier
immortalized it is not infrequently the subject of poetic treatment now
as in the works of Charles G D Roberts6 Clinton Scollard7
and Maurice Thompson8 It is noteworthy too that many of
the younger poets of the day both in Canada and the United States
have sung Laniers praise A complete list is given in the Bibliography
Still further a devoted admirer Mrs Lawrence Turnbull of Baltimore
in The Catholic Man has in the person of Paul the poet
given us an imaginative study of the character of Mr Lanier
Finally only a few months ago the Chautauquans of the class of 1898
determined to call themselves The Laniers in honor of
the poet and his brother

II Laniers Prose Works



With this brief sketch of his life let us turn to Laniers works
and first to those in prose At the head of the list comes Tigerlilies
a novel written within three weeks and published immediately thereafter
in 1867 Under the figure of a strange enormous terrible flower
the seed of which he hopes may perish beyond resurrection the author pictures
the horror of war in general and of the Civil War in particular
An entertaining lovestory runs through the book the plot of which
space does not allow me to detail In execution the novel has grave defects
it lacks unity the characters talk as learnedly as Lanier afterward
wrote of music and at times as in the oftquoted picture of the war1
the style is grandiloquent owing to which blemishes the author
wisely discouraged its republication But in spite of these defects
the book has one very strongly put scene2 the interview
between Smallin and his deserter brother and several beautiful passages3
that distinctly proclaim the highsouled poet


1 Tigerlilies p 115 ff
2 Tigerlilies p 149 ff
3 That on love p 26 is quoted later


Laniers next publication Florida Its Scenery Climate and History
was written by commission of the Atlantic Coast Line and appeared in 1876
To use the authors own epithet Florida is a spiritualized guidebook

Exclusive of the 1877 volume of Poems Laniers next original work
was The Science of English Verse which in lectureform
was delivered to the students of the Johns Hopkins in the winter of 1879
and was published in 1880 According to competent critics the book gives
as searching an investigation of the science of verse on its formal side
as is to be had in any language Since the treatise is so evidently
an epochmaking one I regret that the technicality of the subject forbids
my attempting in this connection even a brief exposition of its principles
I can say only that Lanier treats verse in the terms of music
that according to the promise of the preface he gives
an account of the true relations of music and verse and that in so doing
he has given us the best working theory for English verse
from Caedmon to Tennyson This is a high estimate but it is by no means
so high as that of the lamented poetprofessor Edmund Rowland Sill
who said of The Science of English Verse It is the only work
that has ever made any approach to a rational view of the subject
Nor are the standard ones overlooked in making this assertion


 This may be found in Professor Tolmans article
 cited in the Bibliography
 Quoted by Tolman


Laniers second course of lectures at the Johns Hopkins University
delivered in the winter and spring of 1881 was published in 1883
under the title The English Novel and the Principles of Its Development
According to the authors statement the purpose of the book
is first to inquire what is the special relation of the novel
to the modern man by virtue of which it has become a paramount literary form
and secondly to illustrate this abstract inquiry when completed
by some concrete readings in the greatest of modern English novelists p 4
Addressing himself to the former Lanier attempts to prove 1 that our time
when compared with that of Aeschylus shows an enormous growth
in the personality of man p 5 2 that what we moderns
call Physical Science Music and the Novel all had their origin at
practically the same time about the middle of the seventeenth century p 9
and 3 that the increase of personalities thus going on has brought about
such complexities of relation that the older forms of expression
were inadequate to them and that the resulting necessity
has developed the wonderfully free and elastic form of the modern novel
out of the more rigid Greek drama through the transition form
of the Elizabethan drama p 10 In fulfilment of his second purpose
the author gives a detailed study of several of the novels of George Eliot
whom he takes to be the greatest modern English novelist Even this
brief synopsis of the book must indicate its broad and stimulating character
in which respect it is a worthy successor of The Science of English Verse
Despite the limitations induced by failing life which necessitated
the cutting down of the course of lectures from twenty to twelve
I know of few more lifegiving books and I venture to assert
that it cannot safely be overlooked by any careful student of the subject


 Mrs Lanier informs me that The English Novel will soon
 be issued in an amended form and with a new subtitle
 Studies in the Development of Personality which indicates precisely
 what Mr Lanier intended to attempt and relieves the book

 Spann


Among other prose works I may mention Laniers early extravaganza
Three Waterfalls Bob a happy account of a pet mockingbird
worthy of being placed beside Dr Browns Rab and his Friends
his books for boys Froissart King Arthur Mabinogion and Percy
which have had as they deserve a large sale and his posthumous
From Bacon to Beethoven a highly instructive essay on music




III Laniers Poetry Its Themes



But it is chiefly as a poet that we wish to consider Lanier
and I turn to the posthumous edition of his Poems gotten out by his wife
At the outset let us ask How did the poet look at the world
what problems engaged his attention and how were they solved
A careful investigation will show I believe that
despite the brevity of his life and its consuming cares
Lanier studied the chief questions of our age and that in his poems
he has offered us noteworthy solutions

What for instance is more characteristic of our age than its tendency
to agnosticism I pass by the manifestations of this spirit
in the world of religion of which so much has been heard
and give an illustration or two from the field of history and politics
Picturesque Pocahontas we are told is no more to be believed in
moreover the Pilgrim Fathers did not land at Plymouth Rock
nor did Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence Which way we turn
there is a big interrogationpoint often not for information
but for negation Of the good resulting from the inquisitive spirit
we all know of the baneful influence of inquisitiveness
that has become a mere intellectual pastime or amateurish agnosticism
we likewise have some knowledge but the evil side of this tendency
has seldom been put more forcibly I think than in this stanza
from Laniers Acknowledgment

 O Age that half believst thou half believst
 Half doubtst the substance of thine own half doubt
 And half perceiving that thou half perceivst
 Standst at thy temple door heart in head out
 Lo while thy hearts within helping the choir
 Without thine eyes range up and down the time
 Blinking at oerbright Science smit with desire
 To see and not to see Hence crime on crime
 Yea if the Christ called thine now paced yon street
 Thy halfness hot with his rebuke would swell
 Legions of scribes would rise and run and beat
 His fair intolerable Wholeness twice to hell


 Acknowledgment ll 112


More hurtful than agnosticism because affecting larger masses of people
is the rapid growth of the mercantile spirit during the present century
especially in America This evil the poet saw most clearly
and felt most keenly as every one may learn by reading The Symphony
his great poem in which the speakers are the various musical instruments
The violins begin

 O Trade O Trade would thou wert dead
 The Time needs heart  tis tired of head

Then all the stringed instruments join with the violins in giving
the wail of the poor who stand wedged by the pressing of Trades hand

 We weave in the mills and heave in the kilns
 We sieve minemeshes under the hills
 And thieve much gold from the Devils bank tills
 To relieve O God what manner of ills 
 The beasts they hunger and eat and die
 And so do we and the worlds a sty
 Hush fellowswine why nuzzle and cry
 Swinehood hath no remedy
 Say many men and hasten by
 Clamping the nose and blinking the eye
 But who said once in the lordly tone
 Man shall not live by bread alone
 But all that cometh from the throne
 Hath God said so
 But Trade saith No
 And the kilns and the curttongued mills say Go
 Theres plenty that can if you cant we know
 Move out if you think youre underpaid
 The poor are prolific were not afraid
 Trade is Trade

 Thereat this passionate protesting
 Meekly changed and softened till
 It sank to sad requesting
 And suggesting sadder still
 And oh if men might some time see
 How piteousfalse the poor decree
 That trade no more than trade must be
 Does business mean Die you  live I
 Then Trade is trade but sings a lie
 Tis only war grown miserly
 If business is battle name it so


 The Symphony ll 12
 The Symphony ll 3161


Of even wider sweep than mercantilism is the spirit of intolerance
for while the diffusion of knowledge and of grace has in a measure
repressed this spirit it lacks much of being subdued I do not wonder
that Lanier fled in tears from mens ungodly quarrel about God
and that in his poem entitled Remonstrance he denounces intolerance
with all the vehemence of a prophet of old

But Lanier had an eye for lifes beauties as well as its ills
To him music was one of earths chief blessings Of his early passion
for the violin and his substitution of the flute therefor
we have already learned According to competent critics he was possibly
the greatest fluteplayer1 in the world a fact all the more interesting
when we remember that as he himself tells us2 he never had a teacher
With such a talent for music the poet has naturally strewn his pages
with fine tributes thereto In Tigerlilies for instance
he tells us that while explorers say that they have found
some nations that had no god he knows of none that had no music
and then sums up the matter in this sentence Music means harmony
harmony means love and love means  God3 Even more explicit
is this declaration in a letter of May 1873 to Hayne I dont know
that Ive told you that whatever turn I may have for art is purely MUSICAL
poetry being with me A MERE TANGENT INTO WHICH I SHOOT SOMETIMES
I could play passably on several instruments before I could write legibly
and SINCE then the very deepest of my life has been filled with music
which I have studied and cultivated far more than poetry4
We have already seen incidentally that in his Symphony
the speakers are musical instruments and it is in this poem that occurs
his felicitous definition

 Music is love in search of a word5

In To Beethoven he describes the effect of music upon himself

 I know not how I care not why
 Thy music brings this broil at ease
 And melts my passions mortal cry
 In satisfying symphonies

 Yea it forgives me all my sins
 Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme
 And tunes the task each day begins
 By the last trumpetnote of Time6

It was this profound knowledge of music of course that enabled Lanier
to write his work on The Science of English Verse and gave him
a technical skill in versification akin to that of Tennyson

3 Tigerlilies p 32
4 Haynes A Poets Letters to a Friend After settling in Baltimore
 Lanier devoted more time to poetry than to music as we may see
 from this sentence to Judge Bleckley in his letter of March 20 1876
 As for me life has resolved simply into a time during which
 I must get upon paper as many as possible of the poems
 with which my heart is stuffed like a schoolboys pocket
5 The Symphony l 368
6 To Beethoven ll 6168


Like most great poets of modern times Lanier was a sincere lover of nature
And it seems to me that with him this love was as allembracing as
with Wordsworth Lanier found beauty in the waving corn1 and the clover2
in the mockingbird3 the robin4 and the dove5
in the hickory6 the dogwood6 and the liveoak7
in the murmuring leaves8 and the chattering streams9
in the old red hills10 and the sea11 in the clouds12
sunrise13 and sunset14 and even in the marshes15
which burst into bloom for this worshiper Again Laniers love of nature
was no less insistent than Wordsworths We all remember the latters
oftquoted lines

 To me the meanest flower that blows can give
 Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears16

and beside them one may put this line of Laniers

 The little green leaves would not let me alone in my sleep17

because as the context shows he was

 Shaken with happiness
 The gates of sleep stood wide18

And how naive and tender was this natureworship He speaks of
the clover19 and the clouds20 as cousins and of the leaves21
as sisters and in so doing reminds us of the earliest Italian poetry
especially of The Canticle of the Sun by St Francis of Assisi
who brothers the wind the fire and the sun and sisters the water
the stars and the moon Notice the tenderness in these lines of Corn

 The leaves that wave against my cheek caress
 Like womens hands the embracing boughs express
 A subtlety of mighty tenderness
 The copsedepths into little noises start
 That sound anon like beatings of a heart
 Anon like talk twixt lips not far apart22

to which we find a beautiful parallel in a poem by Paul Hamilton Hayne
himself a reverent natureworshiper

 Ah Nature seems
 Through something sweeter than all dreams
 To woo me yea she seems to speak
 How closely kindly her fond cheek
 Rested on mine her mystic blood
 Pulsing in tender neighborhood
 And soft as any mortal maid
 Half veiled in the twilight shade
 Who leans above her love to tell
 Secrets almost ineffable23

Moreover this worship is restful

 Oh what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea
 Somehow my soul seems suddenly free
 From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin
 By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn

     

 By so many roots as the marshgrass sends in the sod
 I will heartily lay me ahold on the greatness of God
 Oh like to the greatness of God is the greatness within
 The range of the marshes the liberal marshes of Glynn24

But to Lanier the ministration of nature was by no means passive
and we find him calling upon the leaves actively to minister to his need
and even to intercede for him to their Maker

 Ye lispers whisperers singers in storms
 Ye consciences murmuring faiths under forms
 Ye ministers meet for each passion that grieves
 Friendly sisterly sweetheart leaves
 Oh rain me down from your darks that contain me
 Wisdoms ye winnow from winds that pain me 
 Sift down tremors of sweetwithinsweet
 That advise me of more than they bring  repeat
 Me the woodssmell that swiftly but now brought breath
 From the heavenside bank of the river of death 
 Teach me the terms of silence  preach me
 The passion of patience  sift me  impeach me 
 And there oh there
 As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air
 Pray me a myriad prayer25

In this earnest ascription of spirituality to the leaves
Lanier recalls Ruskin26

To take up his next theme Lanier like every true Teuton
from Tacitus to the present saw something of the divine in woman
It was this feeling that led him so severely to condemn a vice that is said
to be growing the marriage for convenience I quote from The Symphony
and the melting Clarionet is speaking

 So hath Trade withered up Loves sinewy prime
 Men love not women as in olden time
 Ah not in these cold merchantable days
 Deem men their life an opal gray where plays
 The one red sweet of gracious ladiespraise
 Now comes a suitor with sharp prying eye 
 Says Here you lady if youll sell Ill buy
 Come heart for heart  a trade What weeping why
 Shame on such wooers dappermercery1

And then follows a wooing that to my mind should be irresistible and that
at any rate is quite as highsouled as Brownings One Way of Love
which I have long considered the highwatermark of the chivalrous in love
The Lady Clarionet is still speaking

 I would my lover kneeling at my feet
 In humble manliness should cry O Sweet
 I know not if thy heart my heart will greet
 I ask not if thy love my love can meet
 Whateer thy worshipful soft tongue shall say
 Ill kiss thine answer be it yea or nay
 I do but know I love thee and I pray
 To be thy knight until my dying day2

I imagine too that any wife that ever lived would be satisfied
with his glorious tribute to Mrs Lanier in My Springs which closes thus

 Dear eyes dear eyes and rare complete 
 Being heavenlysweet and earthlysweet 
 I marvel that God made you mine
 For when he frowns tis then ye shine3

Almost equally felicitous are these lines of Acknowledgment

 Somehow by thee dear Love I win content
 Thy Perfect stops th Imperfects argument4

But the cleverest thing that Lanier has written of woman
occurs in his Laus Mariae

 But thou within thyself dear manifold heart
 Dost bind all epochs in one dainty fact
 Oh Sweet my pretty sum of history
 I leapt the breadth of time in loving thee5

 a scrap worthy to be placed beside Steeles To love her
is a liberal education which has often been declared
the happiest thing on the subject in the English language

To Lanier there was but one thing that made life worth living
and that was love Even the superficial reader must be struck
with the frequent use of the term in the poets works
while all must be uplifted by his conception of its purpose and power
The ills of agnosticism mercantilism and intolerance
all find their solution here and here only as is admirably set forth
in The Symphony of which the opening strain is We are all for love
and the closing Love alone can do The matter is no less happily put
in Tigerlilies For I am quite confident that love is the only rope
thrown out by Heaven to us who have fallen overboard into life
Love for man love for woman love for God  these three chime
like bells in a steeple and call us to worship which is to work   
Inasmuch as we love in so much do we conquer death and flesh
by as much as we love by so much are we gods For God is love
and could we love as He does we could be as He is1
To the same effect is his statement in The English Novel
A republic is the government of the spirit2 The same thought
recurs later In love and love only can great work
that not only pulls down but builds be done it is love and love only
that is truly constructive in art3 In the poem entitled
How Love Looked for Hell Mind and Sense at Loves request
go to seek Hell but ever as they point it out to Love whether in
the material or the immaterial world it vanishes for where Love is
there can be no Hell since in the words of Tolstois story
Where Love is there is God But in one of his poems Lanier sums up
the whole matter in a line

 When lifes all love tis life aught else tis naught4


1 Tigerlilies p 26
2 The English Novel p 55
3 The English Novel p 204
4 In Absence l 42


It is but a short way from love to its source  God
And as Lanier was continually in the atmosphere of the one so I believe
he was ever in the presence of the other for the poets Love means God
is but another phrasing of the evangelists God is love1
Of Laniers grief over church broils and of his longing for freedom
to worship God according to ones own intuition we have already learned
from his Remonstrance What he thought of the Christ we learn
from The Crystal which closes with this invocation

 But Thee but Thee O sovereign Seer of time
 But Thee O poets Poet Wisdoms Tongue
 But Thee O mans best Man O loves best Love
 O perfect life in perfect labor writ
 O all mens Comrade Servant King or Priest 
 What IF or YET what mole what flaw what lapse
 What least defect or shadow of defect
 What rumor tattled by an enemy
 Of inference loose what lack of grace
 Even in tortures grasp or sleeps or deaths 
 Oh what amiss may I forgive in Thee
 Jesus good Paragon Thou Crystal Christ2

How tenderly Lanier was touched by the life of our Lord may be seen
in his Ballad of Trees and the Master a dramatic presentation of the scene
in Gethsemane and on Calvary How implicit was his trust in the Christ
may be gathered from this paragraph in a letter to the elder Hayne
I have a boy whose eyes are blue as your Aethras Every day
when my work is done I take him in my strong arms and lift him up
and pore in his face The intense repose penetrated somehow
with a thrilling mystery of potential activity which dwells
in his large open eye teaches me new things I say to myself
Where are the strong arms in which I too might lay me and repose
and yet be full of the fire of life And always through the twilight
come answers from the other world Master Master there is one  Christ 
in His arms we rest3 Perhaps however Laniers notion of God
whom he declared4 all his roads reached is most clearly expressed
in a scrap quoted by Ward apparently the outline for a poem
I fled in tears from the mens ungodly quarrel about God
I fled in tears to the woods and laid me down on the earth
Then somewhat like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground
and I looked and my cheek lay close to a violet Then my heart took courage
and I said I know that thou art the word of my God dear Violet
And oh the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads
Measure what space a violet stands above the ground Tis no further climbing
that my soul and angels have to do than that5 In this high spirituality
Lanier is in line with the greatest poets of our race from

 Caedmon in the morn
 Acalling angels with the cowherds call
 That late brought up the cattle6

to him

 Who never turned his back but marched breast forward
 Never doubted clouds would break
 Never dreamed though right were worsted wrong would triumph
 Held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better
 Sleep to wake7

Perhaps I may append here a paragraph upon Laniers criticisms
of other writers for they seem to me acute in the extreme
Despite the elaborate essays in defence of Whitmans poetry
by Dowden1 Symonds2 and Whitman himself I believe Lanier is right
in declaring that Whitman is poetrys butcher Huge raw collops
slashed from the rump of poetry and never mind gristle 
is what Whitman feeds our souls with As near as I can make it out
Whitmans argument seems to be that because a prairie is wide
therefore debauchery is admirable and because the Mississippi is long
therefore every American is God3 Notice again how well
the defect of Paradise Lost is pointed out

 And I forgive
 Thee Milton those thy comicdreadful wars
 Where armed with gross and inconclusive steel
 Immortals smite immortals mortalwise
 And fill all heaven with folly4

Few better things have been said of Langland than this 

 That with but a touch
 Of art hadst sung Piers Plowman to the top
 Of English songs whereof tis dearest now
 And most adorable5

or of Emerson than this 

 Most wise that yet in finding Wisdom lost
 Thy Self sometimes6

or of Tennyson than this 

 Largest voice
 Since Milton yet some register of wit
 Wanting7

The Crystal abounds in such happy characterizations

IV Laniers Poetry Its Style



So much for the poets thoughts what shall we say of their expression
In other words is Lanier the literary artist equal to Lanier the seer
In order the better to answer this question let us begin at the beginning
with the elements of style some of which however I pass by
as not calling for special comment

Of Laniers felicitous choice of words we have already had
incidental illustration but it is desirable perhaps to group here
a few of his happiest phrases to show that as Lowell1 said
he is a man of genius with a rare gift for the happy word
Notice this speech about the brook

 And down the hollow from a ferny nook
 Lull sings a little brook2

and this of the wellbucket

 The rattling bucket plumps
 Souse down the well3

and this of the outburst of a bird

 Dumb woods have ye uttered a bird4

and the description of a mockingbird as

 Yon trim Shakspere on the tree5

and of midnight as

 Deaths and truths unlocking time6

Moreover it should be observed that Lanier frequently uses
significant compounds  a habit acquired no doubt
from his study of Old English in which as in German such compounds abound


1 See Lowell in Bibliography
2 From the Flats ll 2324 cited by Gates Line 24 was changed
 to Bright leaps a living brook in later editions  A L 1998
3 Clover ll 2930
4 Sunrise l 57 cited by Gates
5 The MockingBird l 14
6 The Crystal l 1 Other illustrations may be found in the paragraph
 on figures of speech


While in the main Laniers sentenceconstruction is good
occasionally his sentences are too long as in My Springs
To Bayard Taylor and Sunrise in which we have sentences
longer than the opening one in Paradise Lost and what is of more moment
not so well balanced and hence affording fewer breathing spaces
That this detracts from clearness and euphony both every reader will admit

To come to the figures of speech one must be struck at once
with the delicacy and the vigor of Laniers imagination The poets fancy
personifies what at first blush seems to us incapable of personification
Thus at one time1 he likens men to cloverleaves and the Courseofthings
to the browsing ox which makes way with the cloverheads
while at another he addresses an old red hill of Georgia as

 Thou gashed and hairy Lear
 Whom the divine Cordelia of the year
 Een pitying Spring will vainly strive to cheer2

Like other Southern poets3 Lanier sometimes fails to check his imagination
and in consequence leaves his readers brambletangled in a brilliant maze
as in his description of the stars in June Dreams4
and in the Psalm of the West5 While I do not like a maze
brilliant though it be and sweet I must say that I prefer
the embarrassment of riches to the embarrassment of poverty On the whole
however Laniers figures strike me as singularly fresh and happy
In Sunrise for example the poet speaks of the marsh as follows

 The tides at full the marsh with flooded streams
 Glimmers a limpid labyrinth of dreams6

and of the heavens reflected in the marsh waters

 Each winding creek in grave entrancement lies
 A rhapsody of morningstars The skies
 Shine scant with one forked galaxy 
 The marsh brags ten looped on his breast they lie7

Later as the ebbtide flows from marsh to sea we are parenthetically treated
to these two lines

 Run home little streams
 With your lapfuls of stars and dreams8

Finally the heaven itself is thus pictured

 Now in each pettiest personal sphere of dew
 The summd morn shines complete as in the blue
 Big dewdrop of all heaven9

beside which must be hung this exquisite picture

 The dewdrop morn may fall from off the petal of the sky10

As to versification Lanier uses almost all the types of verse
 iambic trochaic blank the sonnet etc  and with about equal skill
Three features however specially characterize his verse
the careful distribution of vowelcolors and the frequent use
of alliteration and of phonetic syzygy1 by which last is meant
a combination or succession of identical or similar consonants
whether initially medially or finally as for instance
the succession of Ms in Tennysons

 The moan of doves in immemorial elms
 And murmuring of innumerable bees

All of these phenomena are illustrated in Laniers
Song of the Chattahoochee which has often been compared
to Tennysons The Brook and which alone proves the author
a master in versification To be sure Lanier occasionally gives us
an improper rhyme as thwart heart2 etc but so does every poet
No doubt too his love of music sometimes led him
not to strain for form effects but to indulge too much therein
or in the words of Mr Stedman to essay in language
feats that only the gamut can render possible3 But as Professor Kent
admirably puts it Lanier was a poet as well as an artist
and if at times his artistic temperament seemed to eclipse his poetic thought
grant that to the poet mind the very manner of expression
may indicate the thought that lies beneath while to the duller ear
the thought must come in completed form4 Moreover as we shall see later
this extraordinary musical endowment gave Lanier a unique position
among English poets


1 See The Science of English Verse p 306 ff
2 In the Foam ll 6 8 See too Kents Study of Laniers Poems
 which gives an exhaustive treatment of Laniers versification
3 Stedmans Poets of America p 449
4 Kent p 60


After what has been said the qualities of style may be briefly handled
As we have already seen Lanier sometimes fails in clearness
or more precisely in simplicity This comes partly
from infelicitous sentenceconstruction partly perhaps
from Laniers extraordinary musical endowment but chiefly I think
from overluxuriance of imagination But this occasional defect
has been unduly exaggerated Thus Mr Gosse1 declares
that Lanier is never simple never easy never in one single lyric
natural and spontaneous for more than one stanza  a statement
so clearly hyperbolic as hardly to call for notice As a matter of fact
Lanier has written numerous poems that offer little or no difficulty
to the reader of average intelligence as Life and Song My Springs
The Symphony The MockingBird The Song of the Chattahoochee
The Waving of the Corn The Revenge of Hamish Remonstrance
A Ballad of Trees and the Master etc More than this
Lanier at times manifests the simplicity that is granted
only to genius of the highest order thus an English critic2
who by the way declares that Laniers volume has more of genius than
all the poems of Poe or Longfellow or Lowell the humorous poems excepted
and who considers Lanier the most original of all American poets
and more original than any England has produced for the last thirty years
says that nothing can be more perfect than 

 The whole sweet round
 Of littles that large life compound3

lines in My Springs and that the touch of wonder in the last two lines

 I marvel that God made you mine
 For when he frowns tis then ye shine4

is as simple and exquisite as any touch of tenderness in our literature
I frankly admit that several of Laniers best poems
as Corn The Marshes of Glynn and Sunrise are not simple
but the same thing is true of Miltons Paradise Lost and of Brownings
The Ring and the Book and yet this fact does not exclude these two works
from the list of great poems Mr Gosse however declares that Corn
Sunrise and The Marshes of Glynn simulate poetic expression
with extraordinary skill But of the real thing of the genuine
traditional article not a trace What do these poems show then
Mr Gosse answers I find a painful effort a strain and rage
the most prominent qualities in everything he wrote which strikes me
as the reverse of the facts In one of his letters5 to Judge Bleckley
Lanier wrote this sentence My head and my heart are both so full of poems
which the dreadful struggle for bread does not give me time
to put on paper that I am often driven to headache and heartache
purely for want of an hour or two to hold a pen If then
he committed an error and I am far from considering him faultless
it was not that he beat and spurred on Pegasus but that he failed
to rein him in Still I repeat that I prefer the embarrassment of riches
to the embarrassment of poverty Finally just as Milton tells us
that the music of the spheres is not to be heard by the gross unpurged ear
so I believe that many intelligent ears and eyes are at first
too gross to hear and see what Lanier puts before them
whereas a bit of patient listening and looking reveals delights
hitherto undreamed of

5 It is to be hoped that these letters may yet be published
 I quote from one dated November 15 1874


If not always simple Lanier is often forcible in the extreme
as in The Symphony The Revenge of Hamish Remonstrance and Sunrise
Of course it is open to any one to see in these poems the rage
attributed to Lanier by Mr Gosse but I prefer to consider it divine wrath
in all but the last and in it wonder unutterable which yet is so uttered
that ears become eyes I allude to the stanzas describing
the break of dawn and the rising of the sun


 Sunrise ll 86152


Of the poets marvelous euphony The Song of the Chattahoochee
speaks clearly enough As we have seen in our treatment of versification
it is here a question not of too little but of too much
But despite an occasional too great yielding to his passion for music
his extraordinary endowment in this direction gave Lanier a unique position
among English poets I quote again from Professor Kent
But if his sense of beauty made him a peer of our great poets
it was the heavenly gift of music that distinguished him from them
Milton it is true whom he most resembles in this respect
had a knowledge of music but not the same passion for it Miltons music
was more a recreation an accompaniment of reverie Laniers was a fiery zeal
a yearning love a chosen and adequate form of expression
of his souls deepest feeling Combined with this passion for music
was his technical knowledge of the art and these combined formed at once
the foundation and the framework of his poetry He seems literally
to have sung his poems they are essentially musical tuneful and melodious
Surcharged with music he overflows in mellifluous numbers Here then
Lanier stands out differentiated in the choir of poets and here we find
that distinctive quality which is the very flavor of his writing


 P 62


While most of Laniers poems are in a serious strain
several disclose no mean sense of humor I refer to his dialect poems
such as Joness Private Argyment Uncle Jims Baptist Revival Hymn
and The Power of Prayer especially the last written in conjunction
with his brother Mr Clifford Lanier

There are passages in the poems no less pathetic than the poets life
In discussing his love of nature we have seen that he was a pantheist
in the best sense of the term So delicate was his sensibility
that we do not wonder when we hear him declaring

 And I am one with all the kinsmen things
 That eer my Father fathered

a saying as felicitous as the Romans I am a man and therefore
nothing human is stranger to me The tenderness of
the Ballad of Trees and the Master must touch all readers
Few passages are more pathetic I think than that in June Dreams
in January telling of the poets struggle for bread and fame
while his worshipful sweet wife sat still afar within the village
whence she sent him forth waiting all confident and proud and calm
And if there occurs therein a plaintive tone let us remember
that it is the only time that he complained of his lot
and that here really he has more in mind his dearer self his wife
and that calm succeeded to unrest just as it does in this passage

 Why can we poets dream us beauty so
 But cannot dream us bread Why now can I
 Make aye create this fervid throbbing June
 Out of the chill chill matter of my soul
 Yet cannot make a poorest pennyloaf
 Out of this same chill matter no not one
 For Mary though she starved upon my breast
 And then he fell upon his couch and sobbed
 And late just when his heart leaned oer
 The very edge of breaking fain to fall

V Laniers Theory of Poetry



It is now time to say a word about Laniers theory of art
especially the art of poetry His views upon the formal side of poetry have
already been noticed in the consideration of his Science of English Verse
and hence receive no further comment here

That Lanier keenly appreciated the responsibility resting upon the artist
appears from Individuality where he tells us

 Awful is art because tis free1

and

 Each artist  gift of terror  owns his will2

But he accepts the responsibility reverently and confidently

 I work in freedom wild
 But work as plays a little child
 Sure of the Father Self and Love alone3


1 Individuality l 62
2 Individuality l 76
3 Individuality ll 8991


Again the province of poetry is pointed out as in Clover

 The artists market is the heart of man
 The artists price some little good of man1

and in The Bee

 Wilt ask What profit eer a poet brings
 He beareth starry stuff about his wings
 To pollen thee and sting thee fertile2

In Corn3 too the tall corncaptain types the poetsoul sublime


1 Clover ll 126127
2 The Bee ll 4042
3 Corn l 52 ff


But it is in his prose works that Lanier has treated the matter
most at length and to these I turn In the first place
he insists that to be an artist one must know a great deal
a statement that would appear superfluous but for its frequent overlooking
by wouldbe artists Hence he is right in warning young writers
You need not dream of winning the attention of sober people with your poetry
unless that poetry and your soul behind it are informed and saturated
with at least the largest final conceptions of current science
That Lanier strove to follow this precept we have abundant evidence
in his life and in his works and I think that if we remember
his environments we must wonder at the vastness the accuracy
and the variety of his knowledge As additionally illustrative of the last
I may add that Lanier invented some improvements for the flute
and made a discovery in the physics of music that the Professor of Physics
in the University of Virginia thought considerable


 Gates p 29
 See West p 23


In the second place Lanier thinks that a poets knowledge of his art
should be scientific It was this that led him to write
The Science of English Verse the motto of which is
But the best conceptions cannot be save where science and genius are
In The English Novel he declares that not a single verse
was ever written by instinct alone since the world began
and fortifies his statement by Ben Jonsons tribute to Shakespeare 

 For a good poets made as well as born
 And such wert thou

But Lanier clearly saw that no formal laws and no amount
of scientific knowledge could alone make a poet as appears from the motto
above quoted from the closing chapter of The Science of English Verse
which tells us that the educated love of beauty is the artists only law
and from this other motto from Sir Philip Sidney A Poet
no industrie can make if his owne Genius bee not carried unto it


 The English Novel p 33


In the third place Lanier holds that a moral intention on the part
of an artist does not interfere with the naturalness or intrinsic beauty
of his work that in art the controlling consideration is rather moral
than artistic beauty but that moral beauty and artistic beauty
so far from being distinct or opposed are convergent and mutually helpful
This thesis he upholds in the following eloquent and cogent passage
Permit me to recall to you in the first place that the requirement
has been from time immemorial that wherever there is contest
as between artistic and moral beauty unless the moral side prevail
all is lost Let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination
of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman
yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh
if the brow be insincere if in the minutest particular the physical beauty
suggest a moral ugliness that sculptor  unless he be portraying
a moral ugliness for a moral purpose  may as well give over his marble
for pavingstones Time whose judgments are inexorably moral will not
accept his work For indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived
how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines which run back
into a common ideal origin and who therefore is not afire
with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty  that he in short
who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy
in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing
burn as one fire shine as one light within him he is not yet
the great artist By copious quotations Lanier then shows
that many fine and beautiful souls appear after a while
to lose all sense of distinction between these terms Beauty Truth Love
Wisdom Goodness and the like and concludes thus And if this be true
cannot one say with authority to the young artist  whether working
in stone in color in tones or in characterforms of the novel
so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere
with your beautiful creation go forward in the clear conviction
that unless you are suffused  soul and body one might say 
with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love
 that is the love of all things in their proper relation 
unless you are suffused with this love do not dare to meddle with beauty
unless you are suffused with beauty do not meddle with love
unless you are suffused with truth do not dare to meddle with goodness 
in a word unless you are suffused with beauty truth wisdom goodness
AND love abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist


 The English Novel p 272 f
 The English Novel p 280 Of the numerous discussions of this thesis
 the student should consult at least those by Matthew Arnold
 Preface to his edition of Wordsworths Poems
 John Ruskin Stones of Venice vol iii chap iv
 and Victor Hugo William Shakespeare Book VI





VI Conclusion



Milton has somewhere said that in order to be a great poet
one must himself be a true poem a dictum none the less trustworthy
because of its inapplicability to its author along with
several other great poets Now of all English poets
I know of none that came nearer being a true poem than did Lanier
He was as spotless as the Lady of Christs and infinitely more lovable
Indeed he seems to me to have realized the ideal of his own knightly Horn
who hopes that some day men will be maids in purity
I will not recall his gentle yet heroic life amid drawbacks
almost unparalleled for it is even sadder than it is beautiful
It is my deliberate judgment that while as the poet says
in his Life and Song no singer has ever wholly lived
his minstrelsy Lanier came so near it that we may fairly say
in the closing lines of the poem

 His song was only living aloud
 His work a singing with his hand

And for my part I am as grateful for his noble private life
as for his distinguished public work


 The Symphony l 302


And yet I will not close with this picture of the man for my purpose
is rather to present the poet Hampered though he was by fewness of years
by feebleness of body by shortness of bread and most of all perhaps
by overluxuriance of imagination Lanier was yet to my mind
indisputably a great poet For in technique he was akin to Tennyson
in the love of beauty and in lyric sweetness to Keats and Shelley
in the love of nature to Wordsworth and in spirituality to Ruskin
the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temporarily having bodies
to Milton Godgifted organvoice of England and to Browning
subtlest assertor of the soul in song To be sure Laniers genius
is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned
but I venture to believe that it is of the same order and therefore
deserving of lasting remembrance


 Mr Thayer puts it stronger As a master of melodious metre
 only Tennyson and he not often has equalled Lanier Mr F F Browne
 Editor of The Dial Chicago compares the two poets in another aspect
 The Symphony of Lanier may recall some parts of Maud
 but the younger poets treatment is as much his own
 as the elders is his own The comparison of Lanier with Tennyson will
 indeed only deepen the impression of his originality
 which is his most striking quality It may be doubted
 if any English poet of our time except Tennyson has cast his work
 in an ampler mould or wrought with more of freedom or stamped his product
 with the impress of a stronger personality His thought his standpoint
 his expression his form his treatment are his alone and through them all
 he justifies his right to the title of poet






 Poems





Life and Song



If life were caught by a clarionet 1
 And a wild heart throbbing in the reed
Should thrill its joy and trill its fret
 And utter its heart in every deed

Then would this breathing clarionet
 Type what the poet fain would be
For none o the singers ever yet
 Has wholly lived his minstrelsy

Or clearly sung his true true thought
 Or utterly bodied forth his life
Or out of life and song has wrought 11
 The perfect one of man and wife

Or lived and sung that Life and Song
 Might each express the others all
Careless if life or art were long
 Since both were one to stand or fall

So that the wonder struck the crowd
 Who shouted it about the land
His song was only living aloud
 His work a singing with his hand

1868



Notes Life and Song


Life and Song is the fifth of a series of seven poems
published under the general heading of Streetcries
with the two stanzas following as an introduction

 Oft seems the Time a markettown
 Where many merchantspirits meet
 Who up and down and up and down
 Cry out along the street

 Their needs as wares one THUS one SO
 Till all the ways are full of sound
  But still come rain and sun and snow
 And still the world goes round

The remaining numbers of the series are 1 Remonstrance
given in this volume 2 The Ship of Earth 3 How Love Looked for Hell
4 Tyranny 6 To Richard Wagner 7 A Song of Love

I can think of no more helpful comment on the subject of our poem
than this sentence from Miltons Apology for Smectymnuus
already alluded to in the Introduction p liv Part VI
And long it was not after when I was confirmed in this opinion
that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter
in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem that is
a composition and pattern of the best and honorablest things
not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities
unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all that
which is praiseworthy

Lines 1920 I have been pleased to discover that the application
I have made of this poem especially of these lines
see Introduction p liv Part VI is likewise made
by most students of Laniers life and that Mrs Lanier has chosen
these two lines for inscription on the monument to be erected to his memory
On the reverse side of the stone I may add are to be put these words
He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God I John iv 16




Joness Private Argyment



That air same Jones which lived in Jones 1
 He had this pint about him
Hed swear with a hundred sighs and groans
That farmers MUST stop gittin loans
 And git along without em

That bankers warehousemen and sich
 Was fattnin on the planter
And Tennessy was rottenrich
Araisin meat and corn all which
 Drawd money to Atlanta

And the only thing says Jones to do 11
 Is eat no meat thats boughten
BUT TEAR UP EVERY I O U
AND PLANT ALL CORN AND SWEAR FOR TRUE
 TO QUIT ARAISIN COTTON

Thus spouted Jones whar folks could hear
  At Court and other gatherins
And thus kep spoutin many a year
Proclaimin loudly far and near
 Sich fiddlesticks and blatherins

But one allfired sweatin day 21
 It happened I was hoein
My lower cornfield which it lay
Longside the road that runs my way
 Whar I can see whats goin

And ater twelve oclock had come
 I felt a kinder faggin
And laid myself unneath a plum
To let my dinner settle sum
 When long come Joness waggin

And Jones was settin in it SO 31
 Areadin of a paper
His mules was goin powerful slow
Fur he had tied the lines onto
 The staple of the scraper

The mules they stopped about a rod
 From me and went to feedin
Longside the road upon the sod
But Jones which he had tuck a tod
 Not knowin kept areadin

And presently says he Hits true 41
 That Clisbys head is level
Thars one thing farmers all must do
To keep themselves from goin tew
 Bankruptcy and the devil

More corn more corn MUST plant less ground
 And MUSTNT eat whats boughten
Next year theyll do it reasonins sound
And cotton will fetch bout a dollar a pound
 THARFORE ILL plant ALL cotton

Macon Ga 1870



Notes Joness Private Argyment


The themes of this poem the relative claims of corn and cotton
upon the attention of the farmer and the disastrous results of speculation
are treated indirectly in Thars More in the Man Than Thar Is in the Land
and directly and with consummate art in Corn

1 That air same Jones appears in Thars More etc written in 1869
in which we are told

 And he lived pretty much by gittin of loans
 And his mules was nuthin but skin and bones
 And his hogs was flat as his cornbread pones
 And he had bout a thousand acres o land

He sells his farm to Brown at a dollar and fifty cents an acre
and goes to Texas Brown improves the farm and after five years
is sitting down to a big dinner when Jones is discovered standing
out by the fence without wagon or mules fur he had left Texas afoot
and cum to Georgy to see if he couldnt git some employment
Brown invites Jones in to dinner but cannot refrain
from the inferencedrawing that names the poem  Which lived in Jones
which Jones is a county of red hills and stones Thars More etc
in central Georgia

13 Readers of David Copperfield will recall Micawbers
frequent use of IOUs

47 Clisbys head refers to Mr Joseph Clisby then editor
of the Macon Ga Telegraph and Messenger who had written editorials
favoring the planting of more corn




Corn



Today the woods are trembling through and through 1
With shimmering forms that flash before my view
Then melt in green as dawnstars melt in blue
 The leaves that wave against my cheek caress
 Like womens hands the embracing boughs express
 A subtlety of mighty tenderness
 The copsedepths into little noises start
 That sound anon like beatings of a heart
 Anon like talk twixt lips not far apart
 The beech dreams balm as a dreamer hums a song
 Through that vague wafture expirations strong 11
 Throb from young hickories breathing deep and long
With stress and urgence bold of prisoned spring
 And ecstasy of burgeoning
 Now since the dewplashed road of morn is dry
 Forth venture odors of more quality
 And heavenlier giving Like Joves locks awry
 Long muscadines
Richwreathe the spacious foreheads of great pines
And breathe ambrosial passion from their vines
 I pray with mosses ferns and flowers shy 21
 That hide like gentle nuns from human eye
 To lift adoring perfumes to the sky
I hear faint bridalsighs of brown and green
Dying to silent hints of kisses keen
As far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen
 I start at fragmentary whispers blown
 From undertalks of leafy souls unknown
 Vague purports sweet of inarticulate tone
Dreaming of gods men nuns and brides between
Old companies of oaks that inward lean 31
To join their radiant amplitudes of green
 I slowly move with ranging looks that pass
 Up from the matted miracles of grass
Into yon veined complex of space
Where sky and leafage interlace
 So close the heaven of blue is seen
 Inwoven with a heaven of green

I wander to the zigzagcornered fence
Where sassafras intrenched in brambles dense
Contests with stolid vehemence 41
 The march of culture setting limb and thorn
 As pikes against the army of the corn

There while I pause my fieldwardfaring eyes
Take harvests where the stately cornranks rise
 Of inward dignities
And large benignities and insights wise
 Graces and modest majesties
Thus without theft I reap anothers field
Thus without tilth I house a wondrous yield
And heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed 51

Look out of line one tall corncaptain stands
Advanced beyond the foremost of his bands
 And waves his blades upon the very edge
 And hottest thicket of the battling hedge
Thou lustrous stalk that neer mayst walk nor talk
 Still shalt thou type the poetsoul sublime
 That leads the vanward of his timid time
 And sings up cowards with commanding rhyme 
Soul calm like thee yet fain like thee to grow
By double increment above below 61
 Soul homely as thou art yet rich in grace like thee
 Teaching the yeomen selfless chivalry
 That moves in gentle curves of courtesy
Soul filled like thy long veins with sweetness tense
 By every godlike sense
Transmuted from the four wild elements
 Drawn to high plans
 Thou liftst more stature than a mortal mans
Yet ever piercest downward in the mould
 And keepest hold 71
 Upon the reverend and steadfast earth
 That gave thee birth
 Yea standest smiling in thy future grave
 Serene and brave
 With unremitting breath
 Inhaling life from death
Thine epitaph writ fair in fruitage eloquent
 Thyself thy monument

 As poets should
Thou hast built up thy hardihood 81
With universal food
 Drawn in select proportion fair
 From honest mould and vagabond air
From darkness of the dreadful night
 And joyful light
 From antique ashes whose departed flame
 In thee has finer life and longer fame
From wounds and balms
From storms and calms
From potsherds and dry bones 91
 And ruinstones
Into thy vigorous substance thou hast wrought
Whateer the hand of Circumstance hath brought
 Yea into cool solacing green hast spun
 White radiance hot from out the sun
So thou dost mutually leaven
Strength of earth with grace of heaven
 So thou dost marry new and old
 Into a one of higher mould
 So thou dost reconcile the hot and cold 101
 The dark and bright
And many a heartperplexing opposite
 And so
 Akin by blood to high and low
Fitly thou playest out thy poets part
Richly expending thy muchbruised heart
 In equal care to nourish lord in hall
 Or beast in stall
 Thou tookst from all that thou mightst give to all

O steadfast dweller on the selfsame spot 111
Where thou wast born that still repinest not 
Type of the homefond heart the happy lot 
 Deeply thy mild content rebukes the land
 Whose flimsy homes built on the shifting sand
Of trade for ever rise and fall
With alternation whimsical
 Enduring scarce a day
 Then swept away
By swift engulfments of incalculable tides
Whereon capricious Commerce rides 121
Look thou substantial spirit of content
Across this little vale thy continent
 To where beyond the mouldering mill
 Yon old deserted Georgian hill
Bares to the sun his piteous aged crest
 And seamy breast
 By restlesshearted children left to lie
 Untended there beneath the heedless sky
 As barbarous folk expose their old to die
Upon that generousrounding side 131
 With gullies scarified
 Where keen Neglect his lash hath plied
Dwelt one I knew of old who played at toil
And gave to coquette Cotton soul and soil
 Scorning the slow reward of patient grain
 He sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain
 Then sat him down and waited for the rain
He sailed in borrowed ships of usury 
A foolish Jason on a treacherous sea
Seeking the Fleece and finding misery 141
 Lulled by smoothrippling loans in idle trance
 He lay content that unthrift Circumstance
 Should plough for him the stony field of Chance
Yea gathering crops whose worth no man might tell
He staked his life on games of BuyandSell
And turned each field into a gamblers hell
 Aye as each year began
 My farmer to the neighboring city ran
Passed with a mournful anxious face
Into the bankers inner place 151
Parleyed excused pleaded for longer grace
 Railed at the drought the worm the rust the grass
 Protested neer again twould come to pass
 With many an oh and if and but alas
Parried or swallowed searching questions rude
And kissed the dust to soften Divess mood
At last small loans by pledges great renewed
 He issues smiling from the fatal door
 And buys with lavish hand his yearly store
 Till his small borrowings will yield no more 161
Aye as each year declined
With bitter heart and everbrooding mind
He mourned his fate unkind
 In dust in rain with might and main
 He nursed his cotton cursed his grain
 Fretted for news that made him fret again
Snatched at each telegram of Future Sale
And thrilled with Bulls or Bears alternate wail 
In hope or fear alike for ever pale
 And thus from year to year through hope and fear 171
 With many a curse and many a secret tear
 Striving in vain his cloud of debt to clear
 At last
He woke to find his foolish dreaming past
 And all his bestoflife the easy prey
 Of squandering scamps and quacks that lined his way
 With vile array
From rascal statesman down to petty knave
Himself at best for all his bragging brave
A gamesters catspaw and a bankers slave 181
 Then worn and gray and sick with deep unrest
 He fled away into the oblivious West
 Unmourned unblest

Old hill old hill thou gashed and hairy Lear
Whom the divine Cordelia of the year
Een pitying Spring will vainly strive to cheer 
 King that no subject man nor beast may own
 Discrowned undaughtered and alone 
Yet shall the great God turn thy fate
And bring thee back into thy monarch state 191
 And majesty immaculate
 Lo through hot waverings of the August morn
 Thou givest from thy vasty sides forlorn
 Visions of golden treasuries of corn 
Ripe largesse lingering for some bolder heart
That manfully shall take thy part
 And tend thee
 And defend thee
With antique sinew and with modern art

Notes Corn


As stated elsewhere Introduction p xvii Part I
Corn was the first of Laniers poems to attract general attention
for this reason as well as for its absolute merit the poem deserves
careful study

In the first of his letters to the Hon Logan E Bleckley
Chiefjustice of Georgia dated October 9 1874 Lanier tells us
how he came to write Corn I enclose MS of a poem
in which I have endeavored to carry some very prosaic matters
up to a loftier plane I have been struck with alarm
in seeing the numbers of deserted old homesteads and gullied hills
in the older counties of Georgia and though they are
dreadfully commonplace I have thought they are surely mournful enough
to be poetic

In the introductory note to Joness Private Argyment
I have incidentally stated the theme of Corn Instead of adding
a more detailed statement of my own here I give Judge Bleckleys
analysis of the poem which occurs in his reply to the abovementioned letter
After giving various minute criticism for Lanier had requested
his unreserved judgment Judge Bleckley continues
Now for the general impression which your Ode has made upon me
It presents four pictures three of them landscapes and one a portrait
You paint the woods a cornfield and a wornout hill
These are your landscapes And your portrait is the likeness of an anxious
unthrifty cottonplanter who always spends his crop before he has made it
borrows on heavy interest to carry himself over from year to year
wears out his land meets at last with utter ruin and migrates to the West
Your second landscape is turned into a vegetable person
and you give its portrait with many touches of marvel and mystery
in vegetable life Your third landscape takes for an instant
the form and tragic state of King Lear you thus make it
seize on our sympathies as if it were a real person and you then restore it
to the inanimate and contemplate its possible beneficence
in the distant future

A comparison of the first draft of Corn as sent Judge Bleckley
with the final form shows that Lanier made many minute changes in the poem
especially in the earlier part Still this earlier draft agrees substantially
with the later and was so fine in conception and execution
as to call forth this commendation of Judge Bleckley which
despite the shortcomings of Corn may with greater justice be applied
to the poem in its present form As an artist you seem to be Italian
in the first two pictures and Dutch or Flemish in the latter two
In your Italian vein you paint with the utmost delicacy and finish
The drawing is scrupulously correct and the color soft and harmonious
When you paint in Dutch or Flemish you are clear and strong
but sometimes hard There is less idealization and more of
the realistic element  your SOLIDS predominate over your fluids

As already stated Lanier has two other poems that indirectly treat the theme
of Corn namely Thars More in the Man and Joness Private Argyment
Moreover he has The Waving of the Corn which though charming
is neither so elaborate nor artistic as Corn

Among poems on corn by other writers may be mentioned the following

1 Whittiers The Cornsong before 1872 a poem of
praise and thanksgiving at the end of The Huskers
which tells of the gathering of the corn and of the cornhusking
known in the South as the cornshucking

2 Woolsons Constance F Corn Fields a description of Ohio fields
in Harpers Monthly 45 444 Aug 1872

3 Thompsons Maurice Dropping Corn 1877 a dainty love lyric
in Poems Boston 1892 p 78

4 Cromwells S C Cornshucking Song a dialect poem
in Harper 69 807 Oct 1884

5 Colemans C W Corn in The Atlantic Monthly 70 228 Aug 1892
which since it consists of but four lines and is more like Laniers poem
than are the others may be quoted

 Drawn up in serried ranks across the fields
 That as we gaze seem ever to increase
 With tasseled flags and sunemblazoned shields
 The glorious army of earths perfect peace

6 Haynes W H Amid the Corn a charming account of the denizens
of the cornfields in his Sylvan Lyrics New York 1893 p 12

7 Dumass W T Cornshucking and The Last Ear of Corn
both lifelike pictures of plantation life in his
The Golden Day and Miscellaneous Poems Phila 1893

57 See Introduction p l Part V

125 In her introductory note to Corn Mrs Lanier thus localizes the poem
His fieldwardfaring eyes took harvest among the stately cornranks
in a portion of middle Georgia sixty miles to the north of Macon
It is a high tract of country from which one looks across the lower reaches
to the distant Blue Ridge Mountains whose wholesome breath
all unobstructed here blends with the woodsodors of the beech the hickory
and the muscadine a part of a range recalled elsewhere by Mr Lanier
as that ample stretch of generous soil where the Appalachian ruggednesses
calm themselves into pleasant hills before dying quite away
into the seaboard levels  where a man can find
such temperances of heaven and earth  enough of struggle with nature
to draw out manhood with enough of bounty to sanction the struggle 
that a more exquisite coadaptation of all blessed circumstances
for mans life need not be sought

My Springs



In the heart of the Hills of Life I know 1
Two springs that with unbroken flow
Forever pour their lucent streams
Into my souls far Lake of Dreams

Not larger than two eyes they lie
Beneath the manychanging sky
And mirror all of life and time
 Serene and dainty pantomime

Shot through with lights of stars and dawns
And shadowed sweet by ferns and fawns
 Thus heaven and earth together vie 11
Their shining depths to sanctify

Always when the large Form of Love
Is hid by storms that rage above
I gaze in my two springs and see
Love in his very verity

Always when Faith with stifling stress
Of grief hath died in bitterness
I gaze in my two springs and see
A Faith that smiles immortally

Always when Charity and Hope 21
In darkness bounden feebly grope
I gaze in my two springs and see
A Light that sets my captives free

Always when Art on perverse wing
Flies where I cannot hear him sing
I gaze in my two springs and see
A charm that brings him back to me

When Labor faints and Glory fails
And coy Reward in sighs exhales
I gaze in my two springs and see 31
Attainment full and heavenly

O Love O Wife thine eyes are they
 My springs from out whose shining gray
Issue the sweet celestial streams
That feed my lifes bright Lake of Dreams

Oval and large and passionpure
And gray and wise and honorsure
Soft as a dying violetbreath
Yet calmly unafraid of death

Thronged like two dovecotes of gray doves 41
With wifes and mothers and poorfolks loves
And homeloves and high gloryloves
And scienceloves and storyloves

And loves for all that God and man
In art and nature make or plan
And ladyloves for spidery lace
And broideries and supple grace

And diamonds and the whole sweet round
Of littles that large life compound
And loves for God and Gods bare truth 51
And loves for Magdalen and Ruth

Dear eyes dear eyes and rare complete 
Being heavenlysweet and earthlysweet
 I marvel that God made you mine
For when He frowns tis then ye shine

Notes My Springs


For my appreciation of this tribute to the poets wife
see Introduction p xxxv Part III Mr Laniers estimate is given
in a letter of March 1874 quoted in Mrs Laniers introductory note
Of course since I have written it to print I cannot make it such
as _I_ desire in artistic design for the forms of today
require a certain trim smugness and cleanshaven propriety
in the face and dress of a poem and I must win a hearing
by conforming in some degree to these tyrannies with a view
to overturning them in the future Written so it is not nearly so beautiful
as I would have it and I therefore have another still in my heart
which I will some day write for myself

Other tributes to his wife are In Absence Acknowledgment
Laus Mariae Special Pleading Evening Song Thou and I
One in Two and Two in One while she is referred to
in The Hard Times in Elfland and June Dreams in January

It will be interesting to compare My Springs with other poems on the eyes
Among the most noteworthy may be cited Shakespeares

 And those eyes the break of day
 Lights that do mislead the morn

Lodges

 Her eyes are sapphires set in snow
 Resembling heaven by every wink
 The Gods do fear whenas they glow
 And I do tremble when I think
 Heigh ho would she were mine

Jonsons

 Drink to me only with thine eyes
 And I will pledge with mine etc

Herricks

 Sweet be not proud of those two eyes
 Which starlike sparkle in their skies

Thomas Stanleys

 Oh turn away those cruel eyes
 The stars of my undoing
 Or death in such a bright disguise
 May tempt a second wooing

Byrons

 She walks in beauty like the night
 Of cloudless climes and starry skies
 And all thats best of dark and bright
 Meet in her aspect and her eyes
 Thus mellowed to that tender light
 Which heaven to gaudy day denies

H Coleridges

 She is not fair to outward view
 As many maidens be
 Her loveliness I never knew
 Until she smiled on me
 O then I saw her eye was bright
 A well of love a spring of light

 But now her looks are coy and cold
 To mine they neer reply
 And yet I cease not to behold
 The lovelight in her eye
 Her very frowns are fairer far
 Than smiles of other maidens are

and Wordsworths

 Her eyes are stars of twilight fair

The Symphony



O Trade O Trade would thou wert dead 1
The Time needs heart  tis tired of head
Were all for love the violins said
Of what avail the rigorous tale
Of bill for coin and box for bale
Grant thee O Trade thine uttermost hope
Level red gold with blue skyslope
And base it deep as devils grope
When alls done what hast thou won
Of the only sweet thats under the sun
Ay canst thou buy a single sigh 11
Of true loves least least ecstasy
Then with a bridegrooms heartbeats trembling
All the mightier strings assembling
Ranged them on the violins side
As when the bridegroom leads the bride
And heart in voice together cried
Yea what avail the endless tale
Of gain by cunning and plus by sale
Look up the land look down the land
The poor the poor the poor they stand 21
Wedged by the pressing of Trades hand
Against an inwardopening door
That pressure tightens evermore
They sigh a monstrous foulair sigh
For the outside leagues of liberty
Where Art sweet lark translates the sky
Into a heavenly melody
Each day all day these poor folks say
In the same old yearlong drearlong way
We weave in the mills and heave in the kilns 31
We sieve minemeshes under the hills
And thieve much gold from the Devils bank tills
To relieve O God what manner of ills 
The beasts they hunger and eat and die
And so do we and the worlds a sty
Hush fellowswine why nuzzle and cry
Swinehood hath no remedy
Say many men and hasten by
Clamping the nose and blinking the eye
But who said once in the lordly tone 41
Man shall not live by bread alone
But all that cometh from the Throne
 Hath God said so
 But Trade saith No
And the kilns and the curttongued mills say Go
Theres plenty that can if you cant we know
Move out if you think youre underpaid
The poor are prolific were not afraid
 Trade is trade
Thereat this passionate protesting 51
Meekly changed and softened till
It sank to sad requesting
And suggesting sadder still
And oh if men might some time see
How piteousfalse the poor decree
That trade no more than trade must be
Does business mean Die you  live I
Then Trade is trade but sings a lie
Tis only war grown miserly
If business is battle name it so 61
Warcrimes less will shame it so
And widows less will blame it so
Alas for the poor to have some part
In yon sweet living lands of Art
Makes problem not for head but heart
Vainly might Platos brain revolve it
Plainly the heart of a child could solve it

And then as when from words that seem but rude
We pass to silent pain that sits abrood
Back in our hearts great dark and solitude 71
So sank the strings to gentle throbbing
Of long chords changemarked with sobbing 
Motherly sobbing not distinctlier heard
Than half wingopenings of the sleeping bird
Some dream of danger to her young hath stirred
Then stirring and demurring ceased and lo
Every least ripple of the strings songflow
Died to a level with each level bow
And made a great chord tranquilsurfaced so
As a brook beneath his curving bank doth go 81
To linger in the sacred dark and green
Where many boughs the still pool overlean
And many leaves make shadow with their sheen
 But presently
A velvet flutenote fell down pleasantly
Upon the bosom of that harmony
And sailed and sailed incessantly
As if a petal from a wildrose blown
Had fluttered down upon that pool of tone
And boatwise dropped o the convex side 91
And floated down the glassy tide
And clarified and glorified
The solemn spaces where the shadows bide
From the warm concave of that fluted note
Somewhat half song half odor forth did float
As if a rose might somehow be a throat
When Nature from her faroff glen
Flutes her soft messages to men
 The flute can say them oer again
 Yea Nature singing sweet and lone 101
Breathes through lifes strident polyphone
The flutevoice in the world of tone
 Sweet friends
 Mans love ascends
To finer and diviner ends
Than mans mere thought eer comprehends
For I een I
As here I lie
A petal on a harmony
Demand of Science whence and why 111
Mans tender pain mans inward cry
When he doth gaze on earth and sky
I am not overbold
 I hold
Full powers from Nature manifold
I speak for each notongued tree
That spring by spring doth nobler be
And dumbly and most wistfully
His mighty prayerful arms outspreads
Above mens oftunheeding heads 121
And his big blessing downward sheds
I speak for allshaped blooms and leaves
Lichens on stones and moss on eaves
Grasses and grains in ranks and sheaves
Broadfronded ferns and keenleaved canes
And briery mazes bounding lanes
And marshplants thirstycupped for rains
And milky stems and sugary veins
For every longarmed womanvine
That round a piteous tree doth twine 131
For passionate odors and divine
Pistils and petals crystalline
All purities of shady springs
All shynesses of filmwinged things
That fly from treetrunks and barkrings
All modesties of mountainfawns
That leap to covert from wild lawns
And tremble if the day but dawns
All sparklings of small beady eyes
Of birds and sidelong glances wise 141
Wherewith the jay hints tragedies
All piquancies of prickly burs
And smoothnesses of downs and furs
Of eiders and of minevers
All limpid honeys that do lie
At stamenbases nor deny
The hummingbirds fine roguery
Beethighs nor any butterfly
All gracious curves of slender wings
Barkmottlings fibrespiralings 151
Fernwavings and leafflickerings
Each dialmarked leaf and flowerbell
Wherewith in every lonesome dell
Time to himself his hours doth tell
All treesounds rustlings of pinecones
Windsighings doves melodious moans
And nights unearthly undertones
All placid lakes and waveless deeps
All cool reposing mountainsteeps
Valecalms and tranquil lotossleeps  161
Yea all fair forms and sounds and lights
And warmths and mysteries and mights
Of Natures utmost depths and heights
 These doth my timid tongue present
Their mouthpiece and leal instrument
And servant all loveeloquent
I heard when ALL FOR LOVE the violins cried
So Nature calls through all her system wide
Give me thy love O man so long denied
Much time is run and man hath changed his ways 171
Since Nature in the antique fabledays
Was hid from mans true love by proxy fays
False fauns and rascal gods that stole her praise
The nymphs cold creatures of mans colder brain
Chilled Natures streams till mans warm heart was fain
Never to lave its love in them again
Later a sweet Voice Love thy neighbor said
Then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread
Beyond all confines of old ethnic dread
Vainly the Jew might wag his covenant head 181
ALL MEN ARE NEIGHBORS so the sweet Voice said
So when mans arms had circled all mans race
The liberal compass of his warm embrace
Stretched bigger yet in the dark bounds of space
With hands agrope he felt smooth Natures grace
Drew her to breast and kissed her sweetheart face
Yea man found neighbors in great hills and trees
And streams and clouds and suns and birds and bees
And throbbed with neighborloves in loving these
But oh the poor the poor the poor 191
That stand by the inwardopening door
Trades hand doth tighten ever more
And sigh their monstrous foulair sigh
For the outside hills of liberty
Where Nature spreads her wild blue sky
For Art to make into melody
Thou Trade thou king of the modern days
 Change thy ways
 Change thy ways
Let the sweaty laborers file 201
 A little while
 A little while
Where Art and Nature sing and smile
Trade is thy heart all dead all dead
And hast thou nothing but a head
Im all for heart the flutevoice said
And into sudden silence fled
Like as a blush that while tis red
Dies to a still still white instead

Thereto a thrilling calm succeeds 211
Till presently the silence breeds
A little breeze among the reeds
That seems to blow by seamarsh weeds
Then from the gentle stir and fret
Sings out the melting clarionet
Like as a lady sings while yet
Her eyes with salty tears are wet
O Trade O Trade the Lady said
I too will wish thee utterly dead
If all thy heart is in thy head 221
For O my God and O my God
What shameful ways have women trod
At beckoning of Trades golden rod
Alas when sighs are traders lies
And heartsease eyes and violet eyes
 Are merchandise
O purchased lips that kiss with pain
O cheeks coinspotted with smirch and stain
O trafficked hearts that break in twain
 And yet what wonder at my sisters crime 231
So hath Trade withered up Loves sinewy prime
Men love not women as in olden time
Ah not in these cold merchantable days
Deem men their life an opal gray where plays
The one red Sweet of gracious ladiespraise
Now comes a suitor with sharp prying eye 
Says Here you Lady if youll sell Ill buy
Come heart for heart  a trade What weeping why
Shame on such wooers dapper mercery
I would my lover kneeling at my feet 241
In humble manliness should cry O sweet
I know not if thy heart my heart will greet
I ask not if thy love my love can meet
Whateer thy worshipful soft tongue shall say
Ill kiss thine answer be it yea or nay
I do but know I love thee and I pray
To be thy knight until my dying day
Woe him that cunning trades in hearts contrives
Base love good women to base loving drives
If men loved larger larger were our lives 251
And wooed they nobler won they nobler wives

There thrust the bold straightforward horn
To battle for that lady lorn
With heartsome voice of mellow scorn
Like any knight in knighthoods morn
 Now comfort thee said he
 Fair Lady
For God shall right thy grievous wrong
And man shall sing thee a truelove song
Voiced in act his whole life long 261
 Yea all thy sweet life long
 Fair Lady
Wheres he that craftily hath said
The day of chivalry is dead
Ill prove that lie upon his head
 Or I will die instead
 Fair Lady
Is Honor gone into his grave
Hath Faith become a caitiff knave
And Selfhood turned into a slave 271
 To work in Mammons cave
 Fair Lady
Will Truths long blade neer gleam again
Hath Giant Trade in dungeons slain
All great contempts of meangot gain
 And hates of inward stain
 Fair Lady
For aye shall name and fame be sold
And place be hugged for the sake of gold
And smirchrobed Justice feebly scold 281
 At Crime all moneybold
 Fair Lady
Shall selfwrapt husbands aye forget
Kisspardons for the daily fret
Wherewith sweet wifely eyes are wet 
 Blind to lips kisswise set 
 Fair Lady
Shall lovers higgle heart for heart
Till wooing grows a trading mart
Where much for little and all for part 291
 Make love a cheapening art
 Fair Lady
Shall woman scorch for a single sin
That her betrayer may revel in
And she be burnt and he but grin
 When that the flames begin
 Fair Lady
Shall neer prevail the womans plea
We maids would far far whiter be
If that our eyes might sometimes see 301
 Men maids in purity
 Fair Lady
Shall Trade aye salve his conscienceaches
With jibes at Chivalrys old mistakes 
The wars that oerhot knighthood makes
 For Christs and ladies sakes
 Fair Lady
Now by each knight that eer hath prayed
To fight like a man and love like a maid
Since Pembrokes life as Pembrokes blade 311
 I the scabbard death was laid
 Fair Lady
I dare avouch my faith is bright
That God doth right and God hath might
Nor time hath changed His hair to white
 Nor His dear love to spite
 Fair Lady
I doubt no doubts I strive and shrive my clay
And fight my fight in the patient modern way
For true love and for thee  ah me and pray 321
 To be thy knight until my dying day
 Fair Lady
Made end that knightly horn and spurred away
Into the thick of the melodious fray


And then the hautboy played and smiled
And sang like any largeeyed child
Coolhearted and all undefiled
 Huge Trade he said
Would thou wouldst lift me on thy head
And run whereer my finger led 331
Once said a Man  and wise was He 
Never shalt thou the heavens see
Save as a little child thou be
Then oer sealashings of commingling tunes
The ancient wise bassoons
 Like weird
 Graybeard
Old harpers sitting on the high seadunes
 Chanted runes
Brightwaved gain graywaved loss 341
The sea of all doth lash and toss
One wave forward and one across
But now twas trough now tis crest
And worst doth foam and flash to best
 And curst to blest

Life Life thou seafugue writ from east to west
 Love Love alone can pore
 On thy dissolving score
 Of harsh halfphrasings
 Blotted ere writ 351
 And double erasings
 Of chords most fit
Yea Love sole musicmaster blest
May read thy weltering palimpsest
To follow Times dying melodies through
And never to lose the old in the new
And ever to solve the discords true 
 Love alone can do
And ever Love hears the poorfolks crying
And ever Love hears the womens sighing 361
And ever sweet knighthoods deathdefying
And ever wise childhoods deep implying
But never a traders glozing and lying

And yet shall Love himself be heard
Though long deferred though long deferred
Oer the modern waste a dove hath whirred
Music is Love in search of a word

Notes The Symphony


The Introduction pp xxviii f xxxiii ff Part III xlvii Part IV
gives besides the plan of The Symphony a detailed statement
of its two themes  the evils of the tradespirit
in the commercial and social world and the need in each of the lovespirit
These questions preyed on the poets mind and were to be treated at length
in The Jacquerie also which he expected to make his great work
but which he was unable to complete This he tells us in a noble passage
to Judge Bleckley in his letter of November 15 1874 After deploring
the lack of time for literary labor see quotation in Introduction
p xlvi Part IV he continues I manage to get a little time tho
to work on what is to be my first magnum opus a long poem
founded on that strange uprising in the middle of the fourteenth century
in France called The Jacquerie It was the first time
that the big hungers of the People appear in our modern civilization
and it is full of significance The peasants learned
from the merchant potentates of Flanders that a man who could not be
a lord by birth might be one by wealth and so Trade arose
and overthrew Chivalry Trade has now had possession of the civilized world
for four hundred years it controls all things it interprets the Bible
it guides our national and almost all our individual life with its maxims
and its oppressions upon the moral existence of man have come to be
ten thousand times more grievous than the worst tyrannies of the Feudal System
ever were Thus in the reversals of time it is NOW the GENTLEMAN
who must rise and overthrow Trade That chivalry which every man has
in some degree in his heart which does not depend upon birth
but which is a revelation from God of justice of fair dealing
of scorn of mean advantages which contemns the selling of stock which
one KNOWS is going to fall to a man who BELIEVES it is going to rise
as much as it would contemn any other form of rascality or of injustice
or of meanness  it is this which must in these latter days
organize its insurrections and burn up every one of the cunning moral castles
from which Trade sends out its forays upon the conscience of modern society
 This is about the plan which is to run through my book
though I conceal it under the form of a pure novel

Mr F F Browne is doubtless right in saying that The Symphony recalls
parts of Tennysons Maud but the closest congeners of The Symphony
in English are I think Langlands Piers The Plowman in poetry
and Ruskins Unto This Last in prose Widely as these two works
differ from The Symphony in form they are one with it
in purpose and in spirit All three voice the outcry of the poor
against the hardness of their lot and their longing for a larger life
all three show that the only hope of relief lies in a broader and deeper
love for humanity Analogues to individual verses of The Symphony

The Power of Prayer or The First Steamboat up the Alabama

 By Sidney and Clifford Lanier



You Dinah Come and set me whar de ribberroads does meet 1
De Lord HE made dese blackjack roots to twis into a seat

For de Lord has built dis body wid de windows hind and fo

I know my front ones IS stopped up and things is sort o dim
But den thu DEM temptations rain wont leak in on ole Jim 11
De back ones show me earth enough aldo deys monsous slim

And as for Hebben  bless de Lord and praise His holy name 
DAT shines in all de coners of dis cabin jes de same
As ef dat cabin hadnt nar a plank upon de frame

Who CALL me Listen down de ribber Dinah Dont you hyar

O hebbenly Marster what thou willest dat mus be jes so
And ef Thou hast bespoke de word some niggers bound to go

Notes The Power of Prayer or The First Steamboat up the Alabama


As the titlepage shows The Power of Prayer is the joint production
of Sidney and Clifford Lanier The latter gentleman informs me
that once he read a newspaper scrap of about ten lines stating that a Negro
on first seeing a steamboat coming down the river was greatly frightened
Mr Lanier then wrote out in metrical form the plot of The Power of Prayer
substantially as we now have it and sent it to his brother Sidney
who polished it up and published it under their joint names
Mr Clifford Lanier had not seen the piece mentioned in the next paragraph
nor had his brother but on being shown the piece the former
was of the opinion that his newspaper clipping must have been based
on the work to which I turn as it had already appeared and the incidents
were so much alike

In the third chapter of The Gilded Age Hartford Conn 1873
by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner there is a piece
Uncle Daniels Apparition and Prayer so similar to The Power of Prayer
that I quote it almost entire Uncle Danl a Negro his wife
his young mistress and his two young masters were sitting on a log
by the Mississippi River one moonlight night atalking
Suddenly Uncle Danl exclaimed Chilen dahs sumfin a comin

All crowded close together and every heart beat faster
Uncle Danl pointed down the river with his bony finger

A deep coughing sound troubled the stillness way toward a wooded cape
that jutted into the stream a mile distant All in an instant
a fierce eye of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent
a long brilliant pathway quivering athwart the dusky water The coughing
grew louder and louder the glaring eye grew larger and still larger
glared wilder and still wilder A huge shape developed itself
out of the gloom and from its tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke
starred and spangled with sparks poured out and went tumbling away
into the farther darkness Nearer and nearer the thing came
till its long sides began to glow with spots of light
which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the monster
like a torchlight procession

What is it Oh what is it Uncle Danl

With deep solemnity the answer came

Its de Almighty Git down on yo knees

It was not necessary to say it twice They were all kneeling in a moment
And then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and stronger
and the threatening glare reached farther and wider the negros voice
lifted up its supplications

O Lord wes ben mighty wicked an we knows dat we zerve to go
to de bad place but good Lord deah Lord we aint ready yit
we aint ready  let dese po chilen hab one mo chance
jes one mo chance Take de ole niggah if yous got to hab somebody 
Good Lord good deah Lord we dont know whah yous a gwine to
we dont know who yous got yo eye on but we knows by de way yous a comin
we know by de way yous a tiltin along in yo charyot o fiah
dat some po sinners a gwine to ketch it But good Lord dese chilen
dont blong heah deys fm Obedstown whah dey dont know nuffin
an you knows yo own sef dat dey aint sponsible An deah Lord
good Lord it aint like yo mercy it aint like yo pity it aint like
yo longsufferin lovinkindness for to take dis kind o vantage
o sich little chilen as dese is when deys so many ornery grown folks
chuck full o cussedness dat wants roastin down dah O Lord
spah de little chilen dont tar de little chilen away fm dey frens
jes let em off jes dis once and take it outn de ole niggah
HEAH I IS LORD HEAH I IS De ole niggahs ready Lord de ole 

The flaming and churning steamer was right abreast the party
and not twenty steps away The awful thunder of a mudvalve
suddenly burst forth drowning the prayer and as suddenly
Uncle Danl snatched a child under each arm and scoured into the woods
with the rest of the pack at his heels And then ashamed of himself
he halted in the deep darkness and shouted but rather feebly

Heah I is Lord heah I is

There was a moment of throbbing suspense and then
to the surprise and comfort of the party it was plain
that the august presence had gone by for its dreadful noises were receding
Uncle Danl headed a cautious reconnoissance in the direction of the log
Sure enough The Lord was just turning a point a short distance up the river
and while they looked the lights winked out and the coughing
diminished by degrees and presently ceased altogether

Hwsh Well now deys some folks says dey aint no ficiency in prah
Dis chile would like to know whah wed a ben now if it warnt fo dat prah
Dats it Dats it

There follows a discussion as to whether or not the prayer caused
the apparition to go by of which of course Uncle Danl has no doubt
The apparition reappears and Uncle Danl betakes himself to prayer again
this time a long way off

I wrote the authors of The Gilded Age and asked the source
of Uncle Daniels Apparition and Prayer Mr Clemens kindly replied
that he is the author of the piece and that it is pure fiction
without either history or tradition back of it

A comparison of the two stories shows some differences
The scene in the one case is the Alabama River in the other the Mississippi
Moreover the PERSONNEL is different The Negro man in Twains story
is about forty in Laniers he is old and has been blind for forty years
Another difference Mr Sidney Lanier points out to his wife
in his letter of October 1 1874 Cliffs and my Power of Prayer
will come out in the Scribners probably in the Etchings
at the end of the Magazine I wrote thee what Dr Holland said
anent its resemblance to something of Mark Twains in plot
Day before yesterday I called and asked Dr Holland what work of Mark Twains
he referred to Well said he I know nothing about it myself
I read the poem to a friend and he suggested that the plot
was like something of Mark Twains But yesterday I read him your note
and he then recollected that in Twains version it is God Almighty
that is coming up the bend In yours it is the Devil  which certainly
makes a little difference and here he broke into a great laugh
Yes I rejoined a difference toto coelo whereat he laughed again
and told me he had already ordered a check to be sent me for the poem

Mr Clifford Lanier was born at Griffin Ga April 24 1844 entered business
in Montgomery Ala at fourteen subsequently attended college
for a year and a half and in May 1862 joined his brother
in the Confederate Army His soldier life has been detailed
in connection with that of the poet In October 1864 Mr Clifford Lanier
was assigned as signal officer to the blockaderunner Talisman
which after two successful runs to the Bermuda Islands
was wrecked in December 1864 He escaped however
and surrendered to the Federal authorities at the end of April 1865
He has been successively lawyer hotel manager and superintendent of schools
in Montgomery Ala For several years past he has been a director
of the Bank of Montgomery and other corporations All the while however
he has been deeply interested in literature and has written
some graceful sketches and poems among which may be mentioned the following
Thornfruit 1867 Love and Loyalty at War 1893
Biding Tryst 1894 prose Greatest of These is Love
The American Philomel Keats and Fanny B The Spirit of Art
Antinous to Hadrian Time Tireless Tramp in Stedman
and Hutchinsons Library of American Literature Love and Life
Edgar Allan Poe etc As stated in the Introduction
the Chautauquans of 1898 have named themselves The Laniers
in honor of Messrs Sidney and Clifford Lanier The motto of the class
is the first line of Mr Clifford Laniers Transformation
Sundayschool Times Phila June 30 1894

 The humblest life that lives may be divine

8 The complete Poems has the before world but Mrs Lanier
thinks the poet must have used de here as elsewhere




Rosemorals



 I  Red

 Would that my songs might be 1
 What roses make by day and night 
Distillments of my clod of misery
 Into delight

 Soul couldst thou bare thy breast
 As yon red rose and dare the day
All clean and large and calm with velvet rest
 Say yea  say yea

 Ah dear my Rose goodbye
 The wind is up so drift away
That songs from me as leaves from thee may fly 11
 I strive I pray


 II  White

 Soul get thee to the heart
 Of yonder tuberose hide thee there 
There breathe the meditations of thine art
 Suffused with prayer

 Of spirit grave yet light
 How fervent fragrances uprise
Pureborn from these most rich and yet most white
 Virginities

 Mulched with unsavory death 21
 Grow Soul unto such white estate
That virginalprayerful art shall be thy breath
 Thy work thy fate

Notes Rosemorals


Rosemorals in English literature probably begin with
Sir John Mandeville in the fourteenth century At any rate
in the eighteenth chapter of his Voyage and Travels he professes
to tell us the origin of red and white roses A fair maid had been
unjustly accused of wrongdoing and doomed to die by fire
And as the woode began to brenne burn about hir she made hir prayer
to our Lorde as she was not gyltie of that thing that he would helpe hir
that it might be knowne to all men And whan when she had thus sayde
she entered the fyre and anone the fyre went out and those braunches
that were brenninge burning became red Roses and those braunches
that were not kindled became white Rosiers rose bushes full of white roses
and those were the fyrst roses and rosyers that any man sawe
and so was the mayden saved through the grace of God

Thomas Carew has several rosemoralities as The True Beauty
beginning He that loves a rosy cheek and his exquisite
Red and White Roses

 Read in these roses the sad story
 Of my hard fate and your own glory
 In the white you may discover
 The paleness of a fainting lover
 In the red the flames still feeding
 On my heart with fresh wounds bleeding
 The white will tell you how I languish
 And the red express my anguish
 The white my innocence displaying
 The red my martyrdom betraying
 The frowns that on your brow resided
 Have those roses thus divided
 Oh let your smiles but clear the weather
 And then they both shall grow together


 See Saintsburys Elizabethan Literature Macmillan  Co New York 1887
 p 363


Rollicking Robert Herrick too draws his morals now advising the virgins
to make much of time as in his Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
now preaching a rarely pathetic sermon as in To Blossoms

 Fair pledges of a fruitful tree
 Why do ye fall so fast
 Your date is not so past
 But you may stay yet here awhile
 To blush and gently smile
 And go at last

 What were ye born to be
 An hour or halfs delight
 And so to bid goodnight
 Twas pity Nature brought ye forth
 Merely to show your worth
 And lose you quite

 But you are lovely leaves where we
 May read how soon things have
 Their end though neer so brave
 And after they have shown their pride
 Like you awhile they glide
 Into the grave


 Palgrave p 89

To  with a Rose



 I asked my heart to say 1
Some word whose worth my loves devoir might pay
 Upon my Ladys natal day

 Then said my heart to me
Learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee
 What fits thy Love most lovingly

 This gift that learning shows
For as a rhyme unto its rhymetwin goes
 I send a rose unto a Rose

Notes To  with a Rose


This poem was sent to Mrs Gibson Peacock of Philadelphia
who was one of Mr Laniers kindest and most appreciative friends
The poets letters to Mr and Mrs Peacock have recently been published
in The Atlantic see Thayer in Bibliography

Of the numerous rosecompliments in English I can here specify but a few
One of the prettiest is that by Henry Constable Saintsbury p 113

 My Ladys presence makes the Roses red
 Because to see her lips they blush for shame

Carews compliment is hardly equal to his morals Gosse p 101

 Ask me no more where Jove bestows
 When June is past the fading rose
 For in your beautys orient deep
 These flowers as in their causes sleep

Few better things have been written than this the second stanza of Jonsons
Drink to me only with thine eyes Gosse p 80

 I sent thee late a rosy wreath
 Not so much honouring thee
 As giving it a hope that there
 It could not withered be
 But thou thereon didst only breathe
 And sentst it back to me
 Since when it grows and smells I swear
 Not of itself but thee

Even more felicitous perhaps is Wallers Go lovely rose which is at once
a compliment and a moral Gosse p 134

 Go lovely rose
 Tell her that wastes her time and me
 That now she knows
 When I resemble her to thee
 How sweet and fair she seems to be

 Tell her thats young
 And shuns to have her graces spied
 That hadst thou sprung
 In deserts where no men abide
 Thou must have uncommended died

 Small is the worth
 Of beauty from the light retired
 Bid her come forth
 Suffer herself to be desired
 And not blush so to be admired

 Then die that she
 The common fate of all things rare
 May read in thee
 How small a part of time they share
 That are so wondrous sweet and fair

Brownings Women and Roses should also be mentioned
and Mrs Brownings translation of Sapphos lovely Song of the Rose


 The fact that Jonson here translates a prose loveletter of Philostratus
 the Greek sophist may detract from the originality but not the beauty
 of his poem

Notes Uncle Jims Baptist Revival Hymn


I think that the following note prefixed by the authors to their poem
sufficiently explains what is to me one of their best humorous pieces

Not long ago a certain Georgia cottonplanter driven to desperation
by awaking each morning to find that the grass had quite outgrown
the cotton overnight and was likely to choke it in defiance of
his lazy freedmens hoes and ploughs set the whole State in a laugh
by exclaiming to a group of fellowsufferers Its all stuff
about Cincinnatus leaving the plough to go into politics for patriotism
he was just arunnin from grass

This state of things  when the delicate young rootlets of the cotton
are struggling against the hardier multitudes of the grasssuckers 
is universally described in plantation parlance by the phrase in the grass
and Uncle Jim appears to have found in it so much similarity
to the condition of his own Baptis church overrun as it was
by the cares of this world that he has embodied it in the refrain
of a revival hymn such as the colored improvisator of the South
not infrequently constructs from his daily surroundings
He has drawn all the ideas of his stanzas from the early morning phenomena
of those critical weeks when the loud plantationhorn is blown
before daylight in order to rouse all hands for a long days fight
against the common enemy of cottonplanting mankind

In addition to these exegetical commentaries the Northern reader
probably needs to be informed that the phrase peerten up means substantially
to spur up and is an active form of the adjective peert
probably a corruption of pert which is so common in the South
and which has much the signification of smart in New England as eg
a peert horse in antithesis to a sorry  ie poor mean lazy one




The Mockingbird



Superb and sole upon a plumed spray 1
That oer the general leafage boldly grew
He summd the woods in song or typic drew
The watch of hungry hawks the lone dismay
Of languid doves when long their lovers stray
And all birds passionplays that sprinkle dew
At morn in brake or bosky avenue
What eer birds did or dreamed this bird could say
Then down he shot bounced airily along
The sward twitched in a grasshopper made song
Midflight perched prinked and to his art again 11
Sweet Science this large riddle read me plain
How may the death of that dull insect be
The life of yon trim Shakspere on the tree

Notes The Mockingbird


Besides this sonnet Mr Lanier wrote a longer To Our Mockingbird
consisting of three sonnets and Bob a charming account in prose
of the life and death of the bird apostrophized

In his Birds and Poets Boston 1877 Mr John Burroughs says
that he knows of only two noteworthy poetical tributes to the mockingbird
those by Whitman and by Wilde both of which he quotes
But since the appearance of his book many poems have been written
to the mockingbird several of which are of enduring worth
Indeed several noteworthy poems had been published
before the appearance of Mr Burroughss essay as will appear
from the list below In a search of two days I found
thirtytwo different authors paying tribute to our marvelous singer

Roughly speaking the poems may be divided into two classes 
first those that as in the Indian legend cited below
make out the mockingbird only or chiefly a thief and thing of evil
and second those that find him though a borrower original and great
The former view fortunately upheld by few is strikingly set forth
in Granalds The Mockbird and the Sparrow After describing minutely
the various songs of the mockingbird and emphasizing
that they all come from other birds the author gives the dialogue
between the mockbird and the sparrow The former taunted the latter
and insisted on his singing and

 The sparrow cockd a knowing eye
 And made him this most tart reply 
 You steal from all and call it wit
 But I prefer my simple twit

But the latter view is espoused by most of the writers mentioned
notably and nobly by Drake the Haynes the Laniers Lee Meek and Thompson
the poetlaureate of the mockingbird whose poems should be read
by every lover of nature and especially of the mockingbird
As Thompsons tributes are all too long for quotation I give here Meeks
in the hope that I may rescue it from the long oblivion of an outofprint
My attention was called to it by my friend Dr C H Ross
to whom every reader will be indebted along with myself It runs as follows

 From the vale what music ringing
 Fills the bosom of the night
 On the sense entranced flinging
 Spells of witchery and delight
 Oer magnolia lime and cedar
 From yon locusttop it swells
 Like the chant of serenader
 Or the rhymes of silver bells
 Listen dearest listen to it
 Sweeter sounds were never heard
 Tis the song of that wild poet 
 Mime and minstrel  Mockingbird

 See him swinging in his glory
 On yon topmost bending limb
 Carolling his amorous story
 Like some wild crusaders hymn
 Now it faints in tones delicious
 As the first low vow of love
 Now it bursts in swells capricious
 All the moonlit vale above
 Listen dearest etc

 Why ist thus this sylvan Petrarch
 Pours all night his serenade
 Tis for some proud woodland Laura
 His sad sonnets all are made
 But he changes now his measure 
 Gladness bubbling from his mouth 
 Jest and gibe and mimic pleasure 
 Winged Anacreon of the South
 Listen dearest etc

 Bird of music wit and gladness
 Troubadour of sunny climes
 Disenchanter of all sadness 
 Would thine art were in my rhymes
 Oer the heart thats beating by me
 I would weave a spell divine
 Is there aught she could deny me
 Drinking in such strains as thine
 Listen dearest etc

As is well known the mockingbird is often called the American nightingale
As to their relative merits as singers here is the judgment of one
that has heard both birds Professor James A Harrison The Critic
New York 2 284 December 13 1884 Well it is my honest opinion
that philomel will not compare with the singer of the South
in sweetness versatility passion or lyrical beauty The mockingbird
 better the echobird with a voice compounded of all sweet sounds
as the blossom of the Chinese olive is compounded of all sweet scents 
is a pure lyrist its throat is a lyre  Aeolian capricious manystringed
as its name suggests it is a polyglot mime a bird linguist
a feathered Mezzofanti singing all the bird languages yet over and above
all this with a something of its own that cannot be described
The mockingbird speaks for himself in Thompsons To an English Nightingale

 What do you think of me
 Do I sing by rote
 Or by note
 Have I a parrots echothroat
 Oh no I caught my strains
 From Natures freshest veins

     

 He
 A match for me
 No more than a wren or a chickadee
 Mine is the voice of the young and strong
 Mine the soul of the brave and free

This selfappreciation is confirmed by the greatest authority on birds
Audubon There is probably no bird in the world that possesses
all the musical qualifications of this king of song who has derived all
from Natures self Yes reader all

It will be interesting and instructive to compare the tributes
to the mockingbird with Keatss Ode to a Nightingale
Shelleys To a Skylark and Wordsworths To the Skylark

Aside from Audubons Birds of America and Ridgways
Manual of North American Birds the student may consult with profit
Burroughss Birds and Poets Thompsons In the Haunts of the Mockingbird
The Atlantic 54 620 November 1884 various articles
by Olive Thorne Miller in The Atlantic vol 54 on and Winterfields
The Mockingbird an Indian Legend The American Whig Review
New York 1 497 May 1845

14 Wilde compares the mockingbird to Yorick and to Jacques
Meek to Petrarch Lanier to Keats in To Our Mockingbird
as does Wm H Hayne

 Each golden note of music greets
 The listening leaves divinely stirred
 As if the vanished soul of Keats
 Had found its new birth in a bird




Song of the Chattahoochee



 Out of the hills of Habersham 1
 Down the valleys of Hall
I hurry amain to reach the plain
Run the rapid and leap the fall
Split at the rock and together again
Accept my bed or narrow or wide
And flee from folly on every side
With a lovers pain to attain the plain
 Far from the hills of Habersham
 Far from the valleys of Hall

 All down the hills of Habersham 11
 All through the valleys of Hall
The rushes cried Abide abide
The willful waterweeds held me thrall
The laving laurel turned my tide
The ferns and the fondling grass said Stay
The dewberry dipped for to work delay
And the little reeds sighed Abide abide
 Here in the hills of Habersham
 Here in the valleys of Hall

 High oer the hills of Habersham 21
 Veiling the valleys of Hall
The hickory told me manifold
Fair tales of shade the poplar tall
Wrought me her shadowy self to hold
The chestnut the oak the walnut the pine
Overleaning with flickering meaning and sign
Said Pass not so cold these manifold
 Deep shades of the hills of Habersham
 These glades in the valleys of Hall

 And oft in the hills of Habersham 31
 And oft in the valleys of Hall
The white quartz shone and the smooth brookstone
Did bar me of passage with friendly brawl
And many a luminous jewel lone
 Crystals clear or acloud with mist
Ruby garnet and amethyst 
Made lures with the lights of streaming stone
 In the clefts of the hills of Habersham
 In the beds of the valleys of Hall

 But oh not the hills of Habersham 41
 And oh not the valleys of Hall
Avail I am fain for to water the plain
Downward the voices of Duty call 
Downward to toil and be mixed with the main
The dry fields burn and the mills are to turn
And a myriad flowers mortally yearn
And the lordly main from beyond the plain
 Calls oer the hills of Habersham
 Calls through the valleys of Hall

Notes Song of the Chattahoochee


The Chattahoochee River rises in Habersham County in northeast Georgia
and intersecting Hall County flows southwestward to West Point
then southward until it unites with the Flint River
at the southwestern extremity of Georgia The Chattahoochee
is about five hundred miles long and small steamboats can ascend it
to Columbus Ga Hon Henry R Jackson of Savannah Ga
late Minister to Mexico has an interesting poem To the Chattahoochee River
in his Tallulah and Other Poems Savannah Ga 1850
and Mr M V Moore in his poem Southern Rivers Harper 66 464
February 1883 has a paragraph on the rivers of Georgia
in which he speaks of the sandy Chattahoochee

In the Introduction pp xxxi Part III xliv xlvii Part IV
I have spoken of this Song as Laniers most finished nature poem
as the most musical of his productions The music of a song
easily eludes all analysis and may be dissipated by a critics breath
but let us try to catch the means by which the effect is in part produced
In five stanzas of ten lines each alliteration occurs in all
save twelve lines In eleven of these twelve lines internal rhyme occurs
sometimes joining the parts of a line sometimes uniting successive lines
Syzygy is used for the same purpose Of the letters occurring in the poem
about onefifth are liquids and about onetwelfth are sibilants
The effect of the whole is musical beyond description
It sings itself and yet nowhere sacrifices the thought Kent

Another way to test the beauty of The Song of the Chattahoochee
is to compare it with other kindred poems There are many streamsongs
in English several of which are very pretty but there is I think
but one rival to our Song and that is Tennysons The Brook
Even so careful a critic as Mr Ward says that The Song of the Chattahoochee
strikes a higher key and is scarcely less musical It will be instructive
too to compare Laniers poem with Southeys The Cataract of Lodore
see Gates p 25 which exhibits considerable talent if not inspiration
with P H Haynes The Meadow Brook which is simple and sweet
and with Wordsworths Brook whose society the Poet seeks
which is grave and elevated Professor Kent suggests as interesting analogues
Poes Ulalume and Buchanan Reads Bay of Naples and if the student
cares to extend his list he should read the streamsongs by Bryant

The Revenge of Hamish



It was three slim does and a tentined buck in the bracken lay 1
 And all of a sudden the sinister smell of a man
 Awaft on a windshift wavered and ran
Down the hillside and sifted along through the bracken and passed that way

Then Nan got atremble at nostril she was the daintiest doe
 In the print of her velvet flank on the velvet fern
 She reared and rounded her ears in turn
Then the buck leapt up and his head as a kings to a crown did go

Full high in the breeze and he stood as if Death had the form of a deer
 And the two slim does long lazily stretching arose
 For their daydream slowlier came to a close 11
Till they woke and were still breathbound with waiting and wonder and fear

Then Alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock the hounds shot by
 The does and the tentined buck made a marvelous bound
 The hounds swept after with never a sound
But Alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh

For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild
 And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds
 For to drive him the deer to the lower glengrounds
I will kill a red deer quoth Maclean in the sight of the wife
 and the child

So gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand 21
 But he hurried tall Hamish the henchman ahead Go turn 
 Cried Maclean  if the deer seek to cross to the burn
Do thou turn them to me nor fail lest thy back be red as thy hand

Now hardfortuned Hamish half blown of his breath with the height
 of the hill
 Was white in the face when the tentined buck and the does
 Drew leaping to burnward huskily rose
His shouts and his nether lip twitched and his legs were oerweak
 for his will

So the deer darted lightly by Hamish and bounded away to the burn
 But Maclean never bating his watch tarried waiting below
 Still Hamish hung heavy with fear for to go 31
All the space of an hour then he went and his face was greenish and stern

And his eye sat back in the socket and shrunken the eyeballs shone
 As withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see
 Now now grim henchman what ist with thee
Brake Maclean and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown

Three does and a tentined buck made out spoke Hamish full mild
 And I ran for to turn but my breath it was blown and they passed
 I was weak for ye called ere I broke me my fast
Cried Maclean Now a tentined buck in the sight of the wife and the child

I had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me
 a snails own wrong 41
 Then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all
 Ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall
And reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong

So Hamish made bare and took him his strokes at the last he smiled
 Now Ill to the burn quoth Maclean for it still may be
 If a slimmerpaunched henchman will hurry with me
I shall kill me the tentined buck for a gift to the wife and the child

Then the clansmen departed by this path and that and over the hill
 Sped Maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame
 And that place of the lashing full quiet became 51
And the wife and the child stood sad and bloodybacked Hamish sat still

But look red Hamish has risen quick about and about turns he
 There is none betwixt me and the cragtop he screams under breath
 Then livid as Lazarus lately from death
He snatches the child from the mother and clambers the crag toward the sea

Now the mother drops breath she is dumb and her heart goes dead for a space
 Till the motherhood mistress of death shrieks shrieks through the glen
 And that place of the lashing is live with men
And Maclean and the gillie that told him dash up in a desperate race

Not a breaths time for asking an eyeglance reveals
 all the tale untold 61
 They follow mad Hamish afar up the crag toward the sea
 And the lady cries Clansmen run for a fee 
Yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold

Fast Hamish back from the brink  and ever she flies up the steep
 And the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain
 But mother tis vain but father tis vain
Stern Hamish stands bold on the brink and dangles the child oer the deep

Now a faintness falls on the men that run and they all stand still
 And the wife prays Hamish as if he were God on her knees
 Crying Hamish O Hamish but please but please 71
For to spare him and Hamish still dangles the child with a wavering will

On a sudden he turns with a seahawk scream and a gibe and a song
 Cries So I will spare ye the child if in sight of ye all
 Ten blows on Macleans bare back shall fall
And ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong

Then Maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red
 Breathed short for a space said Nay but it never shall be
 Let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea
But the wife Can Hamish go fish us the child from the sea if dead

Say yea  Let them lash ME Hamish  Nay 
 Husband the lashing will heal 81
 But oh who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave
 Could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave
Quick Love I will bare thee  so  kneel Then Maclean gan slowly
 to kneel

With never a word till presently downward he jerked to the earth
 Then the henchman  he that smote Hamish  would tremble and lag
 Strike hard quoth Hamish full stern from the crag
Then he struck him and One sang Hamish and danced with the child
 in his mirth

And no man spake beside Hamish he counted each stroke with a song
 When the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height
 And he held forth the child in the heartaching sight 91
Of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong

And there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayer 
 And there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace
 Till her finger nigh felt of the bairnies face 
In a flash fierce Hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air

And sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea
 Shrill screeching Revenge in the windrush and pallid Maclean
 Agefeeble with anger and impotent pain
Crawled up on the crag and lay flat and locked hold of dead roots
 of a tree 

And gazed hungrily oer and the blood from his back
 dripdripped in the brine 101
 And a seahawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew
 And the mother stared white on the waste of blue
And the wind drove a cloud to seaward and the sun began to shine

Notes The Revenge of Hamish


For an appreciation of this fine poem see Introduction
pp xlv xlvii Part IV Mr J R Tait a friend with whom Mr Lanier
discussed The Revenge of Hamish kindly writes me that the author
took the plot from William Blacks novel Macleod of Dare
In chapter iii Macleod of Castle Dare Mull tells the story
to his London entertainer but as the story of the novel
is identical with that of the poem it need not be given here
The novel I should add gives the name of the chieftain only
though as it has a Hamish in another connection it doubtless gave Lanier
this name for the henchman Previous to the reception of Mr Taits letter
I supposed that Lanier had borrowed his plot from a poem by Charles Mackay
Maclaines Child A Legend of Lochbuy Mull which in plot
is identical with Laniers poem except that the former begins
with the speech of the flogged henchman here named Evan
and ends by telling us that the bodies were found and that of Evan was hanged
on a gallowstree The poem is too long for quotation but may be found
in any edition of Mackay or in Garretts One Hundred Choice Selections
Number Nine Phila 1887

17 The Macleans for centuries one of the most powerful of Scottish clans
have since the fourteenth century lived in Mull one of the largest
of the Hebrides Islands The two leading branches of the clan
were the Macleans of Dowart and the Macleans of Lochbuy
both taking their names from the seats of their castles The Lochbuy family
now spells its name MacLAINE For a detailed history of the clan
see Kelties History of the Scottish Highlands Highland Clans etc

The Marshes of Glynn



Glooms of the liveoaks beautifulbraided and woven 1
With intricate shades of the vines that myriadcloven
 Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs 
 Emerald twilights 
 Virginal shy lights
Wrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows
When lovers pace timidly down through the green colonnades
Of the dim sweet woods of the dear dark woods
 Of the heavenly woods and glades
That run to the radiant marginal sandbeach within
 The wide seamarshes of Glynn  11

Beautiful glooms soft dusks in the noonday fire 
Wildwood privacies closets of lone desire
Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves 
Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves
Pure with a sense of the passing of saints through the wood
Cool for the dutiful weighing of ill with good 

O braided dusks of the oak and woven shades of the vine
While the riotous noonday sun of the Juneday long did shine
Ye held me fast in your heart and I held you fast in mine
But now when the noon is no more and riot is rest 21
And the sun is await at the ponderous gate of the West
And the slant yellow beam down the woodaisle doth seem
Like a lane into heaven that leads from a dream 
Ay now when my soul all day hath drunken the soul of the oak
And my heart is at ease from men and the wearisome sound of the stroke
 Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low
 And belief overmasters doubt and I know that I know
 And my spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within
That the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn
Will work me no fear like the fear they have wrought me of yore 31
When length was fatigue and when breadth was but bitterness sore
And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain
Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain 

Oh now unafraid I am fain to face
 The vast sweet visage of space
To the edge of the wood I am drawn I am drawn
Where the gray beach glimmering runs as a belt of the dawn
 For a mete and a mark
 To the forestdark 
 So 41
Affable liveoak leaning low 
Thus  with your favor  soft with a reverent hand
Not lightly touching your person Lord of the land
Bending your beauty aside with a step I stand
On the firmpacked sand
 Free
By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea

 Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band
 Of the sandbeach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land
Inward and outward to northward and southward the beachlines
 linger and curl 51
As a silverwrought garment that clings to and follows
 the firm sweet limbs of a girl
Vanishing swerving evermore curving again into sight
Softly the sandbeach wavers away to a dim gray looping of light
And what if behind me to westward the wall of the woods stands high
The world lies east how ample the marsh and the sea and the sky
A league and a league of marshgrass waisthigh broad in the blade
Green and all of a height and unflecked with a light or a shade
Stretch leisurely off in a pleasant plain
To the terminal blue of the main

Oh what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea 61
 Somehow my soul seems suddenly free
From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin
By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn

Ye marshes how candid and simple and nothingwithholding and free
Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea
Tolerant plains that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun
Ye spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won
God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain
And sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain

As the marshhen secretly builds on the watery sod 71
Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God
I will fly in the greatness of God as the marshhen flies
In the freedom that fills all the space twixt the marsh and the skies
By so many roots as the marshgrass sends in the sod
I will heartily lay me ahold on the greatness of God
Oh like to the greatness of God is the greatness within
The range of the marshes the liberal marshes of Glynn

And the sea lends large as the marsh lo out of his plenty the sea
Pours fast full soon the time of the floodtide must be
Look how the grace of the sea doth go 81
About and about through the intricate channels that flow
 Here and there
 Everywhere
Till his waters have flooded the uttermost creeks and the lowlying lanes
And the marsh is meshed with a million veins
That like as with rosy and silvery essences flow
 In the roseandsilver evening glow
 Farewell my lord Sun
The creeks overflow a thousand rivulets run
Twixt the roots of the sod the blades of the marshgrass stir 91
Passeth a hurrying sound of wings that westward whirr
Passeth and all is still and the currents cease to run
And the sea and the marsh are one

How still the plains of the waters be
The tide is in his ecstasy
The tide is at his highest height
 And it is night

And now from the Vast of the Lord will the waters of sleep
Roll in on the souls of men
But who will reveal to our waking ken 101
The forms that swim and the shapes that creep
 Under the waters of sleep
And I would I could know what swimmeth below when the tide comes in
On the length and the breadth of the marvellous marshes of Glynn

Notes The Marshes of Glynn


Although Dr Callaway noted in his preface the importance of this poem
he did not include it for lack of space This would seem to indicate
that when he published these Selected Poems in 1895
The Marshes of Glynn had not yet achieved its later prominence
as the greatest of Sidney Laniers poems  as now seems to be the opinion
The setting of the poem is the salt marshes surrounding
the coastal city of Brunswick Georgia which is in Glynn County  an area
well deserving of the fame Lanier has given it  and it was intended
as one installment in a series of Hymns of the Marshes of which four poems
were completed

The text is taken from the 1916 edition of Poems of Sidney Lanier

William Hayes Ward wrote of this poem How naturally his large faith in God
finds expression in his Marshes of Glynn

Edwin Mims in his biography of Sidney Lanier concludes by quoting this poem
He writes

His best poems move to the cadence of a tune    Sometimes as in
the Marshes of Glynn and in the best parts of Sunrise there is
a cosmic rhythm that is like unto the rhythmic beating of the heart of God
of which Poe and Lanier have written eloquently

And later continues

Indeed if one had to rely upon one poem to keep alive the fame of Lanier
he could single out The Marshes of Glynn with assurance
that there is something so individual and original about it
and that at the same time there is such a roll and range of verse in it
that it will surely live not only in American poetry but in English
Here the imagination has taken the place of fancy the effort
to do great things ends in victory and the melody of the poem corresponds
to the exalted thought It has all the strong points of Sunrise
with but few of its limitations There is something of
Whitmans virile imagination and Emersons high spirituality
combined with the haunting melody of Poes best work Written in 1878
when Lanier was in the full exercise of all his powers
it is the best expression of his genius and one of the few
great American poems

The background of the poem  as of Sunrise  is the forest
the coast and the marshes near Brunswick Georgia Early in life
Lanier had been thrilled by this wonderful natural scenery
and later visits had the more powerfully impressed his imagination
He is the poet of the marshes as surely as Bryant is of the forests
or Wordsworth of the mountains

The poet represents himself as having spent the day in the forest
and coming at sunset into full view of the length and the breadth
and the sweep of the marshes The glooms of the liveoaks
and the emerald twilights of the dim sweet woods of the dear dark woods
have been as a refuge from the riotous noonday sun More than that
in the wildwood privacies and closets of lone desire he has known
the passionate pleasure of prayer and the joy of elevated thought
His spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within  he is ready
for what Wordsworth calls a godlike hour

Mr Callaway also treats the poem in Part III of the Introduction




Remonstrance



 Opinion let me alone I am not thine 1
Prim Creed with categoric point forbear
 To feature me my Lord by rule and line
Thou canst not measure Mistress Natures hair
 Not one sweet inch nay if thy sight is sharp
 Wouldst count the strings upon an angels harp
 Forbear forbear

 Oh let me love my Lord more fathom deep
Than there is line to sound with let me love
 My fellow not as men that mandates keep
Yea all thats lovable below above 11
 That let me love by heart by heart because
 Free from the penal pressure of the laws
 I find it fair

 The tears I weep by day and bitter night
Opinion for thy sole salt vintage fall
  As morn by morn I rise with fresh delight
Time through my casement cheerily doth call
 Nature is new tis birthday every day
 Come feast with me let no man say me nay
 Whateer befall 21

 So fare I forth to feast I sit beside
Some brother bright but ere goodmorrows passed
 Burly Opinion wedging in hath cried
Thou shalt not sit by us to break thy fast
 Save to our Rubric thou subscribe and swear 
 Religion hath blue eyes and yellow hair
 Shes Saxon all

 Then hard ahungered for my brothers grace
Till wellnigh fain to swear his follys true
 In sad dissent I turn my longing face 31
To him that sits on the left Brother  with you
  Nay not with me save thou subscribe and swear
 Religion hath black eyes and raven hair
 Nought else is true

 Debarred of banquets that my heart could make
With every man on every day of life
 I homeward turn my fires of pain to slake
In deep endearments of a worshiped wife
 I love thee well dear Love quoth she and yet
 Would that thy creed with mine completely met 41
 As one not two

 Assassin Thief Opinion tis thy work
By Church by throne by hearth by every good
 Thats in the Town of Time I see thee lurk
And eer some shadow stays where thou hast stood
 Thou handst sweet Socrates his hemlock sour
 Thou savst Barabbas in that hideous hour
 And stabbst the good

 Deliverer Christ thou rackst the souls of men
Thou tossest girls to lions and boys to flames 51
 Thou hewst Crusader down by Saracen
Thou buildest closets full of secret shames
 Indifferent cruel thou dost blow the blaze
 Round Ridley or Servetus all thy days
 Smell scorched I would

  Thou baseborn Accident of time and place 
Bigot Pretender unto Judgments throne 
 Bastard that claimest with a cunning face
Those rights the true true Son of Man doth own
 By Loves authority  thou Rebel cold 61
 At head of civil wars and quarrels old 
 Thou Knife on a throne 

 I would thou leftst me free to live with love
And faith that through the love of love doth find
 My Lords dear presence in the stars above
The clods below the flesh without the mind
 Within the bread the tear the smile
 Opinion damned Intriguer gray with guile
 Let me alone

Opposition



Of fret of dark of thorn of chill 1
 Complain no more for these O heart
Direct the random of the will
 As rhymes direct the rage of art

The lutes fixt fret that runs athwart
 The strain and purpose of the string
For governance and nice consort
 Doth bar his willful wavering

The dark hath many dear avails
 The dark distils divinest dews
The dark is rich with nightingales 11
 With dreams and with the heavenly Muse

Bleeding with thorns of petty strife
 Ill ease as lovers do my smart
With sonnets to my lady Life
 Writ red in issues from the heart

What grace may lie within the chill
 Of favor frozen fast in scorn
When Goods afreeze we call it Ill
 This rosy Time is glacierborn

Of fret of dark of thorn of chill 21
 Complain thou not O heart for these
Bankin the current of the will
 To uses arts and charities

Notes Opposition


As an introduction to this poem I quote a sentence from Dr Gatess
excellent essay As we look at the circumstances of his life
let us carry with us the strains of this poem which interprets
the use of crosses interferences and attempted thwartings of ones purpose
for the ethical value of Laniers life and writings can be fully understood
only by remembering how much he overcame and how heroically he persisted
in manly work in his chosen art through years of such broken health
as would have driven most men to the inert selfindulgent life of an invalid
The superb power of will which he displayed is a lesson as valuable
as the noble poems which it illustrates and enforces




Marsh Song  At Sunset



Over the monstrous shambling sea 1
 Over the Caliban sea
Bright Arielcloud thou lingerest
Oh wait oh wait in the warm red West 
 Thy Prospero Ill be

Over the humped and fishy sea
 Over the Caliban sea
O cloud in the West like a thought in the heart
Of pardon loose thy wing and start
 And do a grace for me

Over the huge and huddling sea 11
 Over the Caliban sea
Bring hither my brother Antonio  Man 
My injurer night breaks the ban
 Brother I pardon thee

Notes Marsh Song  At Sunset


At the first reading no doubt this song appears indistinct though poetical
On a second reading however with Shakespeares Tempest fresh in mind
it seems as it is highly artistic and we wonder at the happy use
made of the Shakespearean characters the gracious forgiving Prospero
the rightful Duke of Milan Antonio his usurping brother
forgiven notwithstanding Caliban the savage deformed fishlike slave
and Ariel the ministering spirit of the air

With At Sunset compare Laniers Evening Song another and a more agreeable
sunset picture




A Ballad of Trees and the Master



Into the woods my Master went 1
Clean forspent forspent
Into the woods my Master came
Forspent with love and shame
But the olives they were not blind to Him
The little gray leaves were kind to Him
The thorntree had a mind to Him
When into the woods He came

Out of the woods my Master went
And He was well content
Out of the woods my Master came 11
Content with death and shame
When Death and Shame would woo Him last
From under the trees they drew Him last
Twas on a tree they slew Him  last
When out of the woods He came

Baltimore November 1880



Notes A Ballad of Trees and the Master


In the Introduction p xxxi ff Part III I have tried to show
the intensity and the breadth of Laniers love of nature in general
President Gates gives a separate section to Laniers love
of trees and plantlife and after quoting some lines
on the soothing and inspiring companionship of trees
thus speaks of our Ballad This ministration of trees to a mind and heart
forspent with shame and grief finds its culmination in the pathetic lines
upon that olivegarden near Jerusalem which to those of us
who have sat within its shade must always seem the most sacred spot on earth
The almost mystic exaltation of the power of poetic sympathy
which inspired these intense lines Into the Woods my Master went
may impair their religious effect for many devout souls
But to many others this short poem will express most wonderfully
that essential humanheartedness in the Son of Man our Divine Saviour
which made Him one with us in His need of the quiet
sympathetic ministrations of nature  perhaps the heart of the reason
why this olivegrove was the place where He was wont to go for prayer
See St Luke 2239

For Laniers other poems on Christ see Introduction
p xxxvii f Part III




Sunrise



In my sleep I was fain of their fellowship fain 1
 Of the liveoak the marsh and the main
The little green leaves would not let me alone in my sleep
Upbreathed from the marshes a message of range and of sweep
Interwoven with waftures of wild sealiberties drifting
 Came through the lapped leaves sifting sifting
 Came to the gates of sleep
Then my thoughts in the dark of the dungeonkeep
Of the Castle of Captives hid in the City of Sleep
Upstarted by twos and by threes assembling
 The gates of sleep fell atrembling 11
Like as the lips of a lady that forth falter yes
 Shaken with happiness
 The gates of sleep stood wide

I have waked I have come my beloved I might not abide
I have come ere the dawn O beloved my liveoaks to hide
 In your gospelling glooms  to be
As a lover in heaven the marsh my marsh and the sea my sea

Tell me sweet burlybarkd manbodied Tree
That mine arms in the dark are embracing dost know
From what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow 21
They rise not from reason but deeper inconsequent deeps
 Reasons not one that weeps
 What logic of greeting lies
Betwixt dear overbeautiful trees and the rain of the eyes

O cunning green leaves little masters like as ye gloss
All the dulltissued dark with your luminous darks that emboss
The vague blackness of night into pattern and plan
 So
 But would I could know but would I could know
With your question embroidring the dark of the question of man  31
So with your silences purfling this silence of man
While his cry to the dead for some knowledge is under the ban
 Under the ban 
 So ye have wrought me
Designs on the night of our knowledge  yea ye have taught me
 So
 That haply we know somewhat more than we know

 Ye lispers whisperers singers in storms
 Ye consciences murmuring faiths under forms
 Ye ministers meet for each passion that grieves 41
 Friendly sisterly sweetheart leaves
Oh rain me down from your darks that contain me
Wisdoms ye winnow from winds that pain me 
Sift down tremors of sweetwithinsweet
That advise me of more than they bring  repeat
Me the woodssmell that swiftly but now brought breath
From the heavenside bank of the river of death 
 Teach me the terms of silence  preach me
 The passion of patience  sift me  impeach me 
 And there oh there 51
As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air
 Pray me a myriad prayer

 My gossip the owl  is it thou
That out of the leaves of the lowhanging bough
 As I pass to the beach art stirred
 Dumb woods have ye uttered a bird

     

Reverend Marsh lowcouched along the sea
 Old chemist rapt in alchemy
 Distilling silence  lo
That which our fatherage had died to know  61
 The menstruum that dissolves all matter  thou
Hast found it for this silence filling now
The globed clarity of receiving space
This solves us all man matter doubt disgrace
Death love sin sanity
Must in yon silence clear solution lie
Too clear That crystal nothing wholl peruse
The blackest night could bring us brighter news
Yet precious qualities of silence haunt
Round these vast margins ministrant 71
Oh if thy souls at latter gasp for space
With trying to breathe no bigger than thy race
Just to be fellowd when that thou hast found
No man with room or grace enough of bound
To entertain that New thou tellst thou art 
Tis here tis here thou canst unhand thy heart
And breathe it free and breathe it free
By rangy marsh in lone sealiberty

The tides at full the marsh with flooded streams
Glimmers a limpid labyrinth of dreams 81
Each winding creek in grave entrancement lies
A rhapsody of morningstars The skies
Shine scant with one forked galaxy 
The marsh brags ten looped on his breast they lie

Oh what if a sound should be made
Oh what if a bound should be laid
To this bowandstring tension of beauty and silence aspring 
To the bend of beauty the bow or the hold of silence the string
I fear me I fear me yon dome of diaphanous gleam
Will break as a bubble oerblown in a dream  91
Yon dome of tootenuous tissues of space and of night
Overweighted with stars overfreighted with light
Oversated with beauty and silence will seem
 But a bubble that broke in a dream
If a bound of degree to this grace be laid
 Or a sound or a motion made

But no it is made list somewhere  mystery where
 In the leaves in the air
In my heart is a motion made
Tis a motion of dawn like a flicker of shade on shade 101
In the leaves tis palpable low multitudinous stirring
Upwinds through the woods the little ones softly conferring
Have settled my lords to be looked for so they are still
But the air and my heart and the earth are athrill 
And look where the wild duck sails round the bend of the river 
 And look where a passionate shiver
 Expectant is bending the blades
Of the marshgrass in serial shimmers and shades 
And invisible wings fast fleeting fast fleeting
 Are beating 111
The dark overhead as my heart beats  and steady and free
Is the ebbtide flowing from marsh to sea 
 Run home little streams
 With your lapfuls of stars and dreams 
And a sailor unseen is hoisting apeak
For list down the inshore curve of the creek
 How merrily flutters the sail 
And lo in the East Will the East unveil
The East is unveiled the East hath confessed
A flush tis dead tis alive tis dead ere the West 121
Was aware of it nay tis abiding tis unwithdrawn
 Have a care sweet Heaven Tis Dawn

Now a dream of a flame through that dream of a flush is uprolled
 To the zenith ascending a dome of undazzling gold
Is builded in shape as a beehive from out of the sea
The hive is of gold undazzling but oh the Bee
 The starfed Bee the buildfire Bee
 Of dazzling gold is the great SunBee
That shall flash from the hivehole over the sea

 Yet now the dewdrop now the morning gray 131
 Shall live their little lucid sober day
 Ere with the sun their souls exhale away
Now in each pettiest personal sphere of dew
The summd morn shines complete as in the blue
Big dewdrop of all heaven with these lit shrines
Oersilvered to the farthest seaconfines
The sacramental marsh one pious plain
Of worship lies Peace to the antereign
Of Mary Morning blissful mother mild
Minded of nought but peace and of a child 141

Not slower than Majesty moves for a mean and a measure
Of motion  not faster than dateless Olympian leisure
Might pace with unblown ample garments from pleasure to pleasure 
The waveserrate searim sinks unjarring unreeling
 Forever revealing revealing revealing
Edgewise bladewise halfwise wholewise  tis done
 Goodmorrow lord Sun
With several voice with ascription one
The woods and the marsh and the sea and my soul
Unto thee whence the glittering stream of all morrows doth roll 151
Cry good and pastgood and most heavenly morrow lord Sun

O Artisan born in the purple  Workman Heat 
Parter of passionate atoms that travail to meet
And be mixed in the deathcold oneness  innermost Guest
At the marriage of elements  fellow of publicans  blest
King in the blouse of flame that loiterest oer
The idle skies yet laborest fast evermore 
Thou in the fine forgethunder thou in the beat
Of the heart of a man thou Motive  Laborer Heat
Yea Artist thou of whose art yon seas all news 161
With his inshore greens and manifold midsea blues
Pearlglint shelltint ancientest perfectest hues
Ever shaming the maidens  lily and rose
Confess thee and each mild flame that glows
In the clarified virginal bosoms of stones that shine
 It is thine it is thine

Thou chemist of storms whether driving the winds aswirl
Or aflicker the subtiler essences polar that whirl
In the magnet earth  yea thou with a storm for a heart
Rent with debate manyspotted with question part 171
From part oft sundered yet ever a globed light
Yet ever the artist ever more large and bright
Than the eye of a man may avail of  manifold One
I must pass from thy face I must pass from the face of the Sun
Old Want is awake and agog every wrinkle afrown
The worker must pass to his work in the terrible town
But I fear not nay and I fear not the thing to be done
 I am strong with the strength of my lord the Sun
How dark how dark soever the race that must needs be run
 I am lit with the Sun 181

Oh never the masthigh run of the seas
 Of traffic shall hide thee
Never the hellcolored smoke of the factories
 Hide thee
Never the reek of the times fenpolitics
 Hide thee
And ever my heart through the night shall with knowledge abide thee
And ever by day shall my spirit as one that hath tried thee
 Labor at leisure in art  till yonder beside thee
 My soul shall float friend Sun 191
 The day being done

Notes Sunrise


In the words of Mrs Lanier Sunrise Mr Laniers latest completed poem
was written while his sun of life seemed fairly at the setting
and the hand which first pencilled its lines had not strength
to carry nourishment to the lips See Introduction p xviii Part I
Lanier has two other poems on the same theme both short
A Sunrise Song and Between Dawn and Sunrise entered under Marsh Hymns

As already pointed out Introduction pp xxxi Part III xlvii Part IV
Sunrise shows in a powerful way the delicacy and the comprehensiveness
of Laniers love for nature True as I have elsewhere stated
Introduction p xlvi Part IV the poem has some serious limitations
more I think than has The Marshes of Glynn but despite its shortcomings
Sunrise is from an absolute standpoint a great poem
while if we consider the circumstances under which it was produced
it is in the words of Professor Kent a worldmarvel

Aside from the numerous unapproachable snatches in Shakespeare
I know of nothing on the subject in English literature
comparable to Sunrise Mr W W Storys Sunrise is perhaps
the closest parallel and yet it is far inferior to Laniers
as every reader of the two will admit If one wishes to make
further comparisons he may find sunrise poems in the following authors
Blake Cowper Emerson Hood Keats Longfellow Southey Thompson
Willis etc I may add that an interesting though superficial article
on The Poetry of Sunrise and Sunset may be found in
Chamberss Edinburgh Journal 22 234 October 7 1854


 Among others I may cite the following passages

 Hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings

 in Cymbeline 2 3

 But look the morn in russet mantle clad
 Walks oer the dew of yon high eastern hill

 in Hamlet 1 1

 Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintops

 in Romeo and Juliet 3 5 and

 Full many a glorious morning have I seen etc

 Sonnet xxxiii


3 1314 See Introduction p xxxii Part III and compare l 26

3953 See Introduction p xxxiii Part III

42 I had made the comparison between Lanier and St Francis
before reading Dr Gatess essay on Lanier and was delighted to find
my judgment confirmed by so competent a critic Dr Gates is quite emphatic
Since St Francis no soul has seemed so heavily overcharged
with this feeling of brotherhood for all created things
The Canticle of the Sun otherwise known as The Song of the Creatures
may be found in metrical form in Mrs Oliphants life of St Francis
New York 1870 and in prose in Sabatiers Scribners New York 1894

54 Lanier has an Owl against Robin

57 See Introduction p xli Part IV

8085 See Introduction p xliii Part IV

86152 See Introduction p xlvii Part IV Mr F F Browne says
that in lyric sweetness ll 8697 recall the best of Keats and Shelley

114115 See Introduction p xliv Part IV

127 Lanier has a poem entitled The Bee

134136 See Introduction p xliii Part IV

181 Compare Mrs Easters tribute Lit with the Sun

189192 See Introduction p xxi Part I and compare Cowdins tribute
Hopeset and Sunrise and the closing stanza of Hamlin Garlands

 While hearts blood ebbed at every breath
 He passed lifes headland bleak and dun
 Flew through the western gate of Death
 And took his place beside the sun

The following had to be stripped

All instances of Laus Mariae
All instances of Caedmon
when compared with that of Aeschylus shows an enormous growth
 Half veiled in the twilight shade
I have a boy whose eyes are blue as your Aethras Every day
Richly expending thy muchbruised heart
I speak for each notongued tree
Im gwine to stand stifflegged for de Lord dis blessed day
Yes I rejoined a difference toto coelo whereat he laughed again
Superb and sole upon a plumed spray 1
All instances of Cyclopaedia
 On the sense entranced flinging
Aeolian
The globed clarity of receiving space
From part oft sundered yet ever a globed light
Nirvana
