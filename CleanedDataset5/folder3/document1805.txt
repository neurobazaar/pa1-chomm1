THE OCTOPUS MAROONED


A trust is its weakest point said Jeff Peters

That said I sounds like one of those unintelligible remarks such
as Why is a policeman

It is not said Jeff There are no relations between a trust and a
policeman My remark was an epitograman axisa kind of mulctem in
parvo What it means is that a trust is like an egg and it is not
like an egg If you want to break an egg you have to do it from the
outside The only way to break up a trust is from the inside Keep
sitting on it until it hatches Look at the brood of young colleges
and libraries thats chirping and peeping all over the country Yes
sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction
like a rooster that crows near a Georgia colored Methodist camp
meeting or a Republican announcing himself a candidate for governor
of Texas

I asked Jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered
plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of
the class to which the word trust had been applied Somewhat to my
surprise he acknowledged the corner

Once said he And the state seal of New Jersey never bit into
a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate
octopusing We had everything in our favorwind water police
nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public
There wasnt a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak
spot in our scheme It made Rockefellers little kerosene speculation
look like a bucket shop But we lost out

Some unforeseen opposition came up I suppose I said

No sir it was just as I said We were selfcurbed It was a case of
autosuppression There was a rift within the loot as Albert Tennyson
says

You remember I told you that me and Andy Tucker was partners for some
years That man was the most talented conniver at stratagems I ever
saw Whenever he saw a dollar in another mans hands he took it as
a personal grudge if he couldnt take it any other way Andy was
educated too besides having a lot of useful information He had
acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for
hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse He had been
in every line of graft from lecturing on Palestine with a lot of magic
lantern pictures of the annual Custommade Clothiers Association
convention at Atlantic City to flooding Connecticut with bogus wood
alcohol distilled from nutmegs

One Spring me and Andy had been over in Mexico on a flying trip
during which a Philadelphia capitalist had paid us 2500 for a half
interest in a silver mine in Chihuahua Oh yes the mine was all
right The other half interest must have been worth two or three
thousand I often wondered who owned that mine

In coming back to the United States me and Andy stubbed our toes
against a little town in Texas on the bank of the Rio Grande The
name of it was Bird City but it wasnt The town had about 2000
inhabitants mostly men I figured out that their principal means of
existence was in living close to tall chaparral Some of em were
stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were
in the smuggling line Me and Andy put up at a hotel that was built
like something between a roofgarden and a sectional bookcase It
began to rain the day we got there As the saying is Juniper Aquarius
was sure turning on the water plugs on Mount Amphibious

Now there were three saloons in Bird City though neither Andy
nor me drank But we could see the townspeople making a triangular
procession from one to another all day and half the night Everybody
seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had

The third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so
me and Andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape Bird
City was built between the Rio Grande and a deep wide arroyo that
used to be the old bed of the river The bank between the stream and
its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account
of the high water caused by the rain Andy looks at it a long time
That mans intellects was never idle And then he unfolds to me a
instantaneous idea that has occurred to him Right there was organized
a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market

First we went to the main saloon in Bird City called the Blue Snake
and bought it It cost us 1200 And then we dropped in casual at
Mexican Joes place referred to the rain and bought him out for
500 The other one came easy at 400

The next morning Bird City woke up and found itself an island The
river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded
by roaring torrents The rain was still raining and there was heavy
clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual
rainfalls during the next two weeks But the worst was yet to come

Bird City hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and
strolled out for its matutinal toot Lo Mexican Joes place was
closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station So
naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and
ports hellum for the Blue Snake And what does it find there

Behind one end of the bar sits Jefferson Peters octopus with a
sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the
case may be There are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot
sign reading All Drinks One Dollar Andy sits on the safe in his
neat blue suit and goldbanded cigar on the lookout for emergencies
The town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been
promised free drinks by the trust

Well sir it took Bird City just ten minutes to realize that it was
in a cage We expected trouble but there wasnt any The citizens saw
that we had em The nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it
would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable So
they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it
sounded like a selection on the xylophone

There was about 1500 grownup adults in Bird City that had arrived
at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three
to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable The Blue Snake was the
only place where they could get em till the flood subsided It was
beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are

About ten oclock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down
to playing twosteps and marches instead of jigs But I looked out the
window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at
Bird City Savings and Loan Co and I knew they were borrowing more
money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus

At the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner We
told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same
Then me and Andy counted the receipts We had taken in 1300 We
calculated that if Bird City would only remain an island for two weeks
the trust would be able to endow the Chicago University with a new
dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy
poor man in Texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it

Andy was especial inroaded by selfesteem at our success the
rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and
premonitions He got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the
house


Illustration Andy was especial inroaded by selfesteem


Jeff says he I dont suppose that anywhere in the world you
could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about downtreading
the proletariat than the firm of Peters Satan and Tucker
incorporated We have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in
the sole apoplectic region No

Well says I it does look as if we would have to take up
gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves
This little turn in bug juice is verily all to the Skibo And I can
stand it says I Id rather batten than bant any day

Andy pours himself out four fingers of our best rye and does with it
as was so intended It was the first drink I had ever known him to
take

By way of liberation says he to the gods

And then after thus doing umbrage to the heathen diabetes he drinks
another to our success And then he begins to toast the trade
beginning with Raisuli and the Northern Pacific and on down the line
to the little ones like the school book combine and the oleomargarine
outrages and the Lehigh Valley and Great Scott Coal Federation

Its all right Andy says I to drink the health of our brother
monopolists but dont overdo the wassail You know our most eminent
and loathed multicorruptionists live on weak tea and dog biscuits

Andy went in the back room awhile and came out dressed in his best
clothes There was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle
riotousness in his eye that I didnt like I watched him to see what
turn the whiskey was going to take in him There are two times when
you never can tell what is going to happen One is when a man takes
his first drink and the other is when a woman takes her latest

In less than an hour Andys skate had turned to an ice yacht He was
outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium but inside he
was impromptu and full of unexpectedness

Jeff says he do you know that Im a cratera living crater

Thats a selfevident hypothesis says I But youre not Irish
Why dont you say creature according to the rules and syntax of
America

Im the crater of a volcano says he Im all aflame and crammed
inside with an assortment of words and phrases that have got to have
an exodus I can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising
in me says he and Ive got to make a speech of some sort Drink
says Andy always drives me to oratory

It could do no worse says I

From my earliest recollections says he alcohol seemed to
stimulate my sense of recitation and rhetoric Why in Bryans second
campaign says Andy they used to give me three gin rickeys and
Id speak two hours longer than Billy himself could on the silver
question Finally they persuaded me to take the gold cure

If youve got to get rid of your excess verbiage says I why
not go out on the river bank and speak a piece It seems to me
there was an old spellbinder named Cantharides that used to go and
disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore

No says Andy I must have an audience I feel like if I once
turned loose people would begin to call Senator Beveridge the Grand
Young Sphinx of the Wabash Ive got to get an audience together
Jeff and get this oral distension assuaged or it may turn in on me
and Id go about feeling like a deckleedge edition de luxe of Mrs E
D E N Southworth

On what special subject of the theorems and topics does your desire
for vocality seem to be connected with I asks

I aint particular says Andy I am equally good and varicose on
all subjects I can take up the matter of Russian immigration or
the poetry of John W Keats or the tariff or Kabyle literature
or drainage and make my audience weep cry sob and shed tears by
turns

Well Andy says I if you are bound to get rid of this
accumulation of vernacular suppose you go out in town and work it
on some indulgent citizen Me and the boys will take care of the
business Everybody will be through dinner pretty soon and salt pork
and beans makes a man pretty thirsty We ought to take in 1500 more
by midnight

So Andy goes out of the Blue Snake and I see him stopping men on
the street and talking to em By and by he has half a dozen in a
bunch listening to him and pretty soon I see him waving his arms and
elocuting at a goodsized crowd on a corner When he walks away they
string out after him talking all the time and he leads em down the
main street of Bird City with more men joining the procession as they
go It reminded me of the old legerdemain that Id read in books about
the Pied Piper of Heidsieck charming the children away from the town


Illustration And he leads em down the main street of Bird City


One oclock came and then two and three got under the wire for
place and not a Bird citizen came in for a drink The streets were
deserted except for some ducks and ladies going to the stores There
was only a light drizzle falling then

A lonesome man came along and stopped in front of the Blue Snake to
scrape the mud off his boots

Pardner says I what has happened This morning there was hectic
gaiety afoot and now it seems more like one of them ruined cities of
Tyre and Siphon where the lone lizard crawls on the walls of the main
portcullis

The whole town says the muddy man is up in Sperrys wool
warehouse listening to your sidekicker make a speech He is some
gravy on delivering himself of audible sounds relating to matters and
conclusions says the man

Well I hope hell adjourn sine qua non pretty soon says I for
trade languishes

Not a customer did we have that afternoon At six oclock two
Mexicans brought Andy to the saloon lying across the back of a burro
We put him in bed while he still muttered and gesticulated with his
hands and feet

Then I locked up the cash and went out to see what had happened I
met a man who told me all about it Andy had made the finest two hour
speech that had ever been heard in Texas he said or anywhere else in
the world

What was it about I asked

Temperance says he And when he got through every man in Bird
City signed the pledge for a year




JEFF PETERS AS A PERSONAL MAGNET


Jeff Peters has been engaged in as many schemes for making money as
there are recipes for cooking rice in Charleston SC

Best of all I like to hear him tell of his earlier days when he sold
liniments and cough cures on street corners living hand to mouth
heart to heart with the people throwing heads or tails with fortune
for his last coin

I struck Fisher Hill Arkansaw said he in a buckskin suit
moccasins long hair and a thirtycarat diamond ring that I got from
an actor in Texarkana I dont know what he ever did with the pocket
knife I swapped him for it

I was Dr Waughhoo the celebrated Indian medicine man I carried
only one best bet just then and that was Resurrection Bitters It
was made of lifegiving plants and herbs accidentally discovered by
Taquala the beautiful wife of the chief of the Choctaw Nation while
gathering truck to garnish a platter of boiled dog for the annual corn
dance

Business hadnt been good in the last town so I only had five
dollars I went to the Fisher Hill druggist and he credited me for
half a gross of eightounce bottles and corks I had the labels and
ingredients in my valise left over from the last town Life began to
look rosy again after I got in my hotel room with the water running
from the tap and the Resurrection Bitters lining up on the table by
the dozen


Illustration Life began to look rosy again


Fake No sir There was two dollars worth of fluid extract of
cinchona and a dimes worth of aniline in that halfgross of bitters
Ive gone through towns years afterwards and had folks ask for em
again

I hired a wagon that night and commenced selling the bitters on
Main Street Fisher Hill was a low malarial town and a compound
hypothetical pneumocardiac antiscorbutic tonic was just what
I diagnosed the crowd as needing The bitters started off like
sweetbreadsontoast at a vegetarian dinner I had sold two dozen at
fifty cents apiece when I felt somebody pull my coat tail I knew what
that meant so I climbed down and sneaked a five dollar bill into the
hand of a man with a German silver star on his lapel


Illustration I commenced selling the bitters on Main Street


Constable says I its a fine night

Have you got a city license he asks to sell this illegitimate
essence of spooju that you flatter by the name of medicine

I have not says I I didnt know you had a city If I can find it
tomorrow Ill take one out if its necessary

Ill have to close you up till you do says the constable

I quit selling and went back to the hotel I was talking to the
landlord about it

Oh you wont stand no show in Fisher Hill says he Dr Hoskins
the only doctor here is a brotherinlaw of the Mayor and they wont
allow no fake doctor to practice in town

I dont practice medicine says I Ive got a State peddlers
license and I take out a city one wherever they demand it

I went to the Mayors office the next morning and they told me
he hadnt showed up yet They didnt know when hed be down So
Doc Waughhoo hunches down again in a hotel chair and lights a
jimpsonweed regalia and waits

By and by a young man in a blue necktie slips into the chair next to
me and asks the time

Halfpast ten says I and you are Andy Tucker Ive seen you
work Wasnt it you that put up the Great Cupid Combination package on
the Southern States Lets see it was a Chilian diamond engagement
ring a wedding ring a potato masher a bottle of soothing syrup and
Dorothy Vernonall for fifty cents

Andy was pleased to hear that I remembered him He was a good street
man and he was more than thathe respected his profession and he
was satisfied with 300 per cent profit He had plenty of offers to go
into the illegitimate drug and garden seed business but he was never
to be tempted off of the straight path

I wanted a partner so Andy and me agreed to go out together I told
him about the situation in Fisher Hill and how finances was low on
account of the local mixture of politics and jalap Andy had just got
in on the train that morning He was pretty low himself and was going
to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship
by popular subscription at Eureka Springs So we went out and sat on
the porch and talked it over

The next morning at eleven oclock when I was sitting there alone an
Uncle Tom shuffles into the hotel and asked for the doctor to come and
see Judge Banks who it seems was the mayor and a mighty sick man

Im no doctor says I Why dont you go and get the doctor

Boss says he Doc Hoskins am done gone twenty miles in de country
to see some sick persons Hes de only doctor in de town and Massa
Banks am powerful bad off He sent me to ax you to please suh come

As man to man says I Ill go and look him over So I put a
bottle of Resurrection Bitters in my pocket and goes up on the hill
to the mayors mansion the finest house in town with a mansard roof
and two cast iron dogs on the lawn

This Mayor Banks was in bed all but his whiskers and feet He was
making internal noises that would have had everybody in San Francisco
hiking for the parks A young man was standing by the bed holding a
cup of water

Doc says the Mayor Im awful sick Im about to die Cant you
do nothing for me

Mr Mayor says I Im not a regular preordained disciple of S Q
Lapius I never took a course in a medical college says I Ive
just come as a fellow man to see if I could be off assistance

Im deeply obliged says he Doc Waughhoo this is my nephew Mr
Biddle He has tried to alleviate my distress but without success
Oh Lordy Owowow he sings out

I nods at Mr Biddle and sets down by the bed and feels the mayors
pulse Let me see your liveryour tongue I mean says I Then I
turns up the lids of his eyes and looks close that the pupils of em

How long have you been sick I asked

I was taken downowouchlast night says the Mayor Gimme
something for it doc wont you

Mr Fiddle says I raise the window shade a bit will you

Biddle says the young man Do you feel like you could eat some
ham and eggs Uncle James

Mr Mayor says I after laying my ear to his right shoulder blade
and listening youve got a bad attack of superinflammation of the
right clavicle of the harpsichord

Good Lord says he with a groan Cant you rub something on it
or set it or anything

I picks up my hat and starts for the door

You aint going doc says the Mayor with a howl You aint going
away and leave me to die with thissuperfluity of the clapboards are
you

Common humanity Dr Whoaha says Mr Biddle ought to prevent
your deserting a fellowhuman in distress

Dr Waughhoo when you get through plowing says I And then I
walks back to the bed and throws back my long hair

Mr Mayor says I there is only one hope for you Drugs will do
you no good But there is another power higher yet although drugs are
high enough says I

And what is that says he

Scientific demonstrations says I The triumph of mind over
sarsaparilla The belief that there is no pain and sickness except
what is produced when we aint feeling well Declare yourself in
arrears Demonstrate

What is this paraphernalia you speak of Doc says the Mayor You
aint a Socialist are you

I am speaking says I of the great doctrine of psychic
financieringof the enlightened school of longdistance
subconscientious treatment of fallacies and meningitisof that
wonderful indoor sport known as personal magnetism

Can you work it doc asks the Mayor

Im one of the Sole Sanhedrims and Ostensible Hooplas of the Inner
Pulpit says I The lame talk and the blind rubber whenever I make
a pass at em I am a medium a coloratura hypnotist and a spirituous
control It was only through me at the recent seances at Ann Arbor
that the late president of the Vinegar Bitters Company could revisit
the earth to communicate with his sister Jane You see me peddling
medicine on the street says I to the poor I dont practice
personal magnetism on them I do not drag it in the dust says I
because they havent got the dust

Will you treat my case asks the Mayor

Listen says I Ive had a good deal of trouble with medical
societies everywhere Ive been I dont practice medicine But to
save your life Ill give you the psychic treatment if youll agree as
mayor not to push the license question

Of course I will says he And now get to work doc for them
pains are coming on again

My fee will be 25000 cure guaranteed in two treatments says I

All right says the Mayor Ill pay it I guess my lifes worth
that much

I sat down by the bed and looked him straight in the eye

Now says I get your mind off the disease You aint sick
You havent got a heart or a clavicle or a funny bone or brains or
anything You havent got any pain Declare error Now you feel the
pain that you didnt have leaving dont you

I do feel some little better doc says the Mayor darned if I
dont Now state a few lies about my not having this swelling in my
left side and I think I could be propped up and have some sausage and
buckwheat cakes

I made a few passes with my hands

Now says I the inflammations gone The right lobe of the
perihelion has subsided Youre getting sleepy You cant hold your
eyes open any longer For the present the disease is checked Now you
are asleep

The Mayor shut his eyes slowly and began to snore

You observe Mr Tiddle says I the wonders of modern science

Biddle says he When will you give uncle the rest of the
treatment Dr Poohpooh

Waughhoo says I Ill come back at eleven tomorrow When he
wakes up give him eight drops of turpentine and three pounds of steak
Good morning

The next morning I was back on time Well Mr Riddle says I when
he opened the bedroom door and how is uncle this morning

He seems much better says the young man

The mayors color and pulse was fine I gave him another treatment
and he said the last of the pain left him

Now says I youd better stay in bed for a day or two and youll
be all right Its a good thing I happened to be in Fisher Hill Mr
Mayor says I for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the
regular schools of medicine use couldnt have saved you And now
that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer lets allude to a
cheerfuller subjectsay the fee of 250 No checks please I hate
to write my name on the back of a check almost as bad as I do on the
front

Ive got the cash here says the mayor pulling a pocket book from
under his pillow

He counts out five fiftydollar notes and holds em in his hand

Bring the receipt he says to Biddle

I signed the receipt and the mayor handed me the money I put it in
my inside pocket careful

Now do your duty officer says the mayor grinning much unlike a
sick man

Mr Biddle lays his hand on my arm

Youre under arrest Dr Waughhoo alias Peters says he for
practising medicine without authority under the State law

Who are you I asks

Ill tell you who he is says Mr Mayor sitting up in bed Hes a
detective employed by the State Medical Society Hes been following
you over five counties He came to me yesterday and we fixed up this
scheme to catch you I guess you wont do any more doctoring around
these parts Mr Fakir What was it you said I had doc the mayor
laughs compoundwell it wasnt softening of the brain I guess
anyway

A detective says I

Correct says Biddle Ill have to turn you over to the sheriff

Lets see you do it says I and I grabs Biddle by the throat and
half throws him out the window but he pulls a gun and sticks it under
my chin and I stand still Then he puts handcuffs on me and takes
the money out of my pocket


Illustration And I grabs Biddle by the throat


I witness says he that theyre the same bank bills that you and
I marked Judge Banks Ill turn them over to the sheriff when we get
to his office and hell send you a receipt Theyll have to be used
as evidence in the case

All right Mr Biddle says the mayor And now Doc Waughhoo he
goes on why dont you demonstrate Cant you pull the cork out of
your magnetism with your teeth and hocuspocus them handcuffs off

Come on officer says I dignified I may as well make the best
of it And then I turns to old Banks and rattles my chains

Mr Mayor says I the time will come soon when youll believe
that personal magnetism is a success And youll be sure that it
succeeded in this case too

And I guess it did

When we got nearly to the gate I says We might meet somebody now
Andy I reckon you better take em off and Hey Why of course
it was Andy Tucker That was his scheme and thats how we got the
capital to go into business together




MODERN RURAL SPORTS


Jeff Peters must be reminded Whenever he is called upon pointedly
for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of
incident as the longest of Trollopes novels But lured he will
divulge Therefore I cast many and divers flies upon the current of
his thoughts before I feel a nibble

I notice said I that the Western farmers in spite of their
prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again

Its the running season said Jeff for farmers shad maple trees
and the Connemaugh river I know something about farmers I thought I
struck one once that had got out of the rut but Andy Tucker proved to
me I was mistaken Once a farmer always a sucker said Andy Hes
the man thats shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and
the ballet Hes the funnybone and gristle of the country said
Andy and I dont know who we would do without him

One morning me and Andy wakes up with sixtyeight cents between us
in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the predigested hoecake belt
of Southern Indiana How we got off the train there the night before
I cant tell you for she went through the village so fast that what
looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a
composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart Why
we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide
gold watch and Alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day
before over the Kentucky line

When I woke up I heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the
fumes of nitromuriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the
floor below us and a man swearing

Cheer up Andy says I Were in a rural community Somebody has
just tested a gold brick downstairs Well go out and get whats
coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away

Farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me Whenever I was
in hard luck Id go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmers
suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of
a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and
papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without
asking any questions Farmers are not fair game to me as high up in
our business as me and Andy was but there was times when we found em
useful just as Wall Street does the Secretary of the Treasury now and
then

When we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest
farming section we ever see About two miles away on a hill was a
big white house in a grove surrounded by a widespread agricultural
agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and outhouses

Whose house is that we asked the landlord

That says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial
and horticultural accessories of Farmer Ezra Plunkett one of our
countys most progressive citizens

After breakfast me and Andy with eight cents capital left casts the
horoscope of the rural potentate

Let me go alone says I Two of us against one farmer would look
as onesided as Roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly

All right says Andy I like to be a true sport even when Im only
collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers What bait are you going
to use for this Ezra thing Andy asks me

Oh I says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case I
reckon Ill take along some of the new income tax receipts and the
recipe for making clover honey out of clabber and apple peelings and
the order blanks for the McGuffeys readers which afterwards turn out
to be McCormicks reapers and the pearl necklace found on the train
and a pocketsize goldbrick and a

Thatll be enough says Andy Any one of the lot ought to land on
Ezra And say Jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean
new bills Its a disgrace to our Department of Agriculture Civil
Service and Pure Food Law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand
out to use Ive had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles
of microbe cultures captured out of a Red Cross ambulance

So I goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks I drove
out to the Plunkett farm and hitched There was a man sitting on the
front steps of the house He had on a white flannel suit a diamond
ring golf cap and a pink ascot tie Summer boarder says I to
myself

Id like to see Farmer Ezra Plunkett says I to him

You see him says he What seems to be on your mind

I never answered a word I stood still repeating to myself the
rollicking lines of that merry jingle The Man with the Hoe When
I looked at this farmer the little devices I had in my pocket for
buncoing the pushedback brows seemed as hopeless as trying to shake
down the Beef Trust with a mittimus and a parlor rifle

Well says he looking at me close speak up I see the left pocket
of your coat sags a good deal Out with the goldbrick first Im rather
more interested in the bricks than I am in the trick sixtyday notes
and the lost silver mine story

I had a kind of cerebral sensation of foolishness in my ideas of
ratiocination but I pulled out the little brick and unwrapped my
handkerchief off it

One dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his
hand Is it a trade

The lead in it is worth more than that says I dignified I put it
back in my pocket

All right says he But I sort of wanted it for the collection Im
starting I got a 5000 one last week for 210

Just then a telephone bell rings in the house

Come in Bunk says the farmer and look at my place Its kind of
lonesome here sometimes I think thats New York calling

We went inside The room looked like a Broadway stockbrokerslight
oak desks two phones Spanish leather upholstered chairs and
couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting
off the news in one corner

Hello hello says this funny farmer Is that the Regent Theatre
Yes this is Plunkett of Woodbine Centre Reserve four orchestra
seats for Friday eveningmy usual ones Yes Fridaygoodbye

I run over to New York every two weeks to see a show says the
farmer hanging up the receiver I catch the eighteenhour flyer at
Indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the Yappian
Way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost fortyeight
hours later Oh the pristine Hubbard squasherino of the cavedwelling
period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the
DontBlowOuttheGas Association dont you think Mr Bunk

I seem to perceive says I a kind of hiatus in the agrarian
traditions in which heretofore I have reposed confidence

Sure Bunk says he The yellow primrose on the rivers brim is
getting to look to us Reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the
Language of Flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece

Just then the telephone calls him again

Hello hello says he Oh thats Perkins at Milldale I told you
800 was too much for that horse Have you got him there Good Let me
see him Get away from the transmitter Now make him trot in a circle
Faster Yes I can hear him Keep onfaster yet  Thatll do
Now lead him up to the phone Closer Get his nose nearer There Now
wait No I dont want that horse What No not at any price He
interferes and hes windbroken Goodbye

Now Bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that
agriculture has had a hair cut You belong in a bygone era Why
Tom Lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an uptodate
agriculturalist napping Its Saturday the Fourteenth on the farm
you bet Now look here and see how we keep up with the days
doings

He shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like
the pennyintheslot affairs I puts it on and listens A female
voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other
political casualities

What you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of todays news in
the New York Chicago St Louis and San Francisco papers It is wired
in to our Rural News Bureau and served hot to subscribers On this
table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country Also
a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines

I picks up one sheet and sees that its headed Special Advance
Proofs In July 1909 the _Century_ will sayand so forth

The farmer rings up somebodyhis manager I reckonand tells him to
let that herd of 15 Jerseys go at 600 a head and to sow the 900acre
field in wheat and to have 200 extra cans ready at the station for
the milk trolley car Then he passes the Henry Clays and sets out a
bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker
tape

Consolidated Gas up two points says he Oh very well

Ever monkey with copper I asks

Stand back says he raising his hand or Ill call the dog I
told you not to waste your time

After a while he says Bunk if you dont mind my telling you your
company begins to cloy slightly Ive got to write an article on the
Chimera of Communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the Race
Track Association this afternoon Of course you understand by now that
you cant get my proxy for your Remedy whatever it may be

Well sir all I could think of to do was to go out and get in the
buggy The horse turned round and took me back to the hotel I hitched
him and went in to see Andy In his room I told him about this farmer
word for word and I sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of
sagaciousness

I dont understand it says I humming a sad and foolish little
song to cover my humiliation

Andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end
of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking

Jeff says he finally I believe your story of this expurgated
rustic but I am not convinced It looks incredulous to me that he
could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems
of bucolic bunco Now you never regarded me as a man of special
religious proclivities did you Jeff says Andy

Well says I No But says I not to wound his feelings I have
also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so
outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if
you rubbed em with it

I have always been a deep student of nature from creation down
says Andy and I believe in an ultimatum design of Providence
Farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood
to men like me and you Else why was we given brains It is my belief
that the manna that the Israelites lived on for forty years in the
wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up
the practice to this day And now says Andy I am going to test my
theory Once a farmer always a comeon in spite of the veneering
and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him

Youll fail same as I did says I This ones shook off the
shackles of the sheepfold Hes entrenched behind the advantages of
electricity education literature and intelligence

Ill try said Andy There are certain Laws of Nature that Free
Rural Delivery cant overcome

Andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a
suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand His vest is red
with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat I noticed hed soaked
his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink

Great Barnums says I Youre a ringer for a circus thimblerig
man

Right says Andy Is the buggy outside Wait here till I come
back I wont be long

Two hours afterwards Andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money
on the table

Eight hundred and sixty dollars said he Let me tell you He
was in He looked me over and began to guy me I didnt say a word
but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on
the table I whistled a tune or two and then I started up the old
formula

Step up lively gentlemen says I and watch the little ball It
costs you nothing to look There you see it and there you dont
Guess where the little joker is The quickness of the hand deceives
the eye

I steals a look at the farmer man I see the sweat coming out on his
forehead He goes over and closes the front door and watches me some
more Directly he says Ill bet you twenty I can pick the shell the
balls under now

After that goes on Andy there is nothing new to relate He only
had 860 cash in the house When I left he followed me to the gate
There was tears in his eyes when he shook hands

Bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure Ive had in
years It brings up happy old days when I was only a farmer and not an
agriculturalist God bless you

Here Jeff Peters ceased and I inferred that his story was done

Then you thinkI began

Yes said Jeff Something like that You let the farmers go ahead
and amuse themselves with politics Farmings a lonesome life and
theyve been against the shell game before




THE CHAIR OF PHILANTHROMATHEMATICS


I see that the cause of Education has received the princely gift of
more than fifty millions of dollars said I

I was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while Jeff
Peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut

Which same said Jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by
the entire class in philanthromathematics

Is that an allusion I asked

It is said Jeff I never told you about the time when me and Andy
Tucker was philanthropists did I It was eight years ago in Arizona
Andy and me was out in the Gila mountains with a twohorse wagon
prospecting for silver We struck it and sold out to parties in
Tucson for 25000 They paid our check at the bank in silvera
thousand dollars in a sack We loaded it in our wagon and drove
east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect
Twentyfive thousand dollars doesnt sound like so much when youre
reading the annual report of the Pennsylvania Railroad or listening to
an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon
sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring
against another it makes you feel like you was a nightandday bank
with the clock striking twelve

The third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy
little towns that Nature or Rand and McNally ever turned out It was
in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about 2000
head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants The town seemed to be called
Floresville and Nature had not contaminated it with many railroads
fleas or Eastern tourists

Me and Andy deposited our money to the credit of Peters and Tucker in
the Esperanza Savings Bank and got rooms at the Skyview Hotel After
supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked Then was
when the philanthropy idea struck me I suppose every grafter gets it
sometime

When a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to
get scared and wants to return part of it And if youll watch close
and notice the way his charity runs youll see that he tries to
restore it to the same people he got it from As a hydrostatical case
take lets say A A made his millions selling oil to poor students
who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for
regulating the trusts So back to the universities and colleges goes
his conscience dollars

Theres B got his from the common laboring man that works with his
hands and tools Hows he to get some of the remorse fund back into
their overalls

Aha says B Ill do it in the name of Education Ive skinned the
laboring man says he to himself but according to the old proverb
Charity covers a multitude of skins

So he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the
boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit

Wheres the books asks the reading public

I dinna ken says B I offered ye libraries and there they are I
suppose if Id given ye preferred steel trust stock instead yed have
wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters Hoot for ye

But as I said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me
philanthropitis It was the first time me and Andy had ever made a
pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it

Andy says I were wealthynot beyond the dreams of average but
in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as Greasers I feel as
if Id like to do something for as well as to humanity

I was thinking the same thing Jeff says he Weve been gouging
the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from
selling selfigniting celluloid collars to flooding Georgia with Hoke
Smith presidential campaign buttons Id like myself to hedge a bet
or two in the graft game if I could do it without actually banging
the cymbalines in the Salvation Army or teaching a bible class by the
Bertillon system

Whatll we do says Andy Give free grub to the poor or send a
couple of thousand to George Cortelyou

Neither says I Weve got too much money to be implicated in
plain charity and we havent got enough to make restitution So
well look about for something thats about half way between the two

The next day in walking around Floresville we see on a hill a big red
brick building that appears to be disinhabited The citizens speak up
and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by
a mine owner After running up the house he finds he only had 280
left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off
the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces

As soon as me and Andy saw that building the same idea struck both of
us We would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and
put an iron dog and statues of Hercules and Father John on the lawn
and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world
right there

So we talks it over to the prominent citizens of Floresville who
falls in fine with the idea They give a banquet in the engine house
to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the
cause of progress and enlightenment Andy makes an hourandahalf
speech on the subject of irrigation in Lower Egypt and we have a
moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet

Andy and me didnt lose any time in philanthropping We put every man
in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the
building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls We wire
to Frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders
dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges
twentyseven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an
open order for all the truck that goes with a firstclass university
I took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list
but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an
ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a
currycomb among em

While the weekly papers was having chalkplate cuts of me and Andy
we wired an employment agency in Chicago to express us fob six
professors immediatelyone English literature one uptodate
dead languages one chemistry one political economydemocrat
preferredone logic and one wise to painting Italian and music
with union card The Esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to
run between 800 and 80050

Well sir we finally got in shape Over the front door was carved
the words The Worlds University Peters  Tucker Patrons and
Proprietors And when September the first got a crossmark on the
calendar the comeons begun to roll in First the faculty got off the
triweekly express from Tucson They was mostly young spectacled and
redheaded with sentiments divided between ambition and food Andy
and me got em billeted on the Floresvillians and then laid for the
students

They came in bunches We had advertised the University in all
the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country
responded Two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from 18 up
to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education They
ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new
mohair and you couldnt have told it from Harvard or Goldfields at
the March term of court

They marched up and down the streets waving flags with the Worlds
University colorsultramarine and blueand they certainly made a
lively place of Floresville Andy made them a speech from the balcony
of the Skyview Hotel and the whole town was out celebrating

In about two weeks the professors got the students disarmed and
herded into classes I dont believe theres any pleasure equal
to being a philanthropist Me and Andy bought high silk hats and
pretended to dodge the two reporters of the Floresville Gazette
The paper had a man to kodak us whenever we appeared on the street
and ran our pictures every week over the column headed Educational
Notes Andy lectured twice a week at the University and afterward
I would rise and tell a humorous story Once the Gazette printed my
pictures with Abe Lincoln on one side and Marshall P Wilder on the
other

Andy was as interested in philanthropy as I was We used to wake up
of nights and tell each other new ideas for booming the University

Andy says I to him one day theres something we overlooked The
boys ought to have dromedaries

Whats that Andy asks

Why something to sleep in of course says I All colleges have
em

Oh you mean pajamas says Andy

I do not says I I mean dromedaries But I never could make Andy
understand so we never ordered em Of course I meant them long
bedrooms in colleges where the scholars sleep in a row

Well sir the Worlds University was a success We had scholars
from five States and territories and Floresville had a boom A new
shooting gallery and a pawn shop and two more saloons started and the
boys got up a college yell that went this way


 Raw raw raw
 Done done done
 Peters Tucker
 Lots of fun
 Bowwowwow
 Hawheehaw
 World University
 Hip hurrah


The scholars was a fine lot of young men and me and Andy was as
proud of em as if they belonged to our own family

But one day about the last of October Andy comes to me and asks if I
have any idea how much money we had left in the bank I guesses about
sixteen thousand Our balance says Andy is 82162

What says I with a kind of a yell Do you mean to tell me that
them infernal clodhopping doughheaded pupfaced goosebrained
gatestealing rabbiteared sons of horse thieves have soaked us for
that much

No less says Andy

Then to Helvetia with philanthropy says I

Not necessarily says Andy Philanthropy says he when run on
a good business basis is one of the best grafts going Ill look into
the matter and see if it cant be straightened out

The next week I am looking over the payroll of our faculty when I
run across a new nameProfessor James Darnley McCorkle chair of
mathematics salary 100 per week I yells so loud that Andy runs in
quick

Whats this says I A professor of mathematics at more than
5000 a year How did this happen Did he get in through the window
and appoint himself

I wired to Frisco for him a week ago says Andy In ordering the
faculty we seemed to have overlooked the chair of mathematics

A good thing we did says I We can pay his salary two weeks and
then our philanthropy will look like the ninth hole on the Skibo golf
links

Wait a while says Andy and see how things turn out We have
taken up too noble a cause to draw out now Besides the further I
gaze into the retail philanthropy business the better it looks to me
I never thought about investigating it before Come to think of it
now goes on Andy all the philanthropists I ever knew had plenty of
money I ought to have looked into that matter long ago and located
which was the cause and which was the effect

I had confidence in Andys chicanery in financial affairs so I left
the whole thing in his hands The University was flourishing fine
and me and Andy kept our silk hats shined up and Floresville kept on
heaping honors on us like we was millionaires instead of almost busted
philanthropists

The students kept the town lively and prosperous Some stranger came
to town and started a faro bank over the Red Front livery stable and
began to amass money in quantities Me and Andy strolled up one night
and piked a dollar or two for sociability There were about fifty of
our students there drinking rum punches and shoving high stacks of
blues and reds about the table as the dealer turned the cards up

Why dang it Andy says I these freeschoolhunting
ganderheaded silksocked little sons of sapsuckers have got more
money than you and me ever had Look at the rolls theyre pulling out
of their pistol pockets

Yes says Andy a good many of them are sons of wealthy miners and
stockmen Its very sad to see em wasting their opportunities this
way

At Christmas all the students went home to spend the holidays We had
a farewell blowout at the University and Andy lectured on Modern
Music and Prehistoric Literature of the Archipelagos Each one of the
faculty answered to toasts and compared me and Andy to Rockefeller
and the Emperor Marcus Autolycus I pounded on the table and yelled
for Professor McCorkle but it seems he wasnt present on the
occasion I wanted a look at the man that Andy thought could earn 100
a week in philanthropy that was on the point of making an assignment

The students all left on the night train and the town sounded as
quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight When I
went to the hotel I saw a light in Andys room and I opened the door
and walked in

There sat Andy and the faro dealer at a table dividing a twofoot
high stack of currency in thousanddollar packages

Correct says Andy Thirtyone thousand apiece Come in Jeff
says he This is our share of the profits of the first half of
the scholastic term of the Worlds University incorporated and
philanthropated Are you convinced now says Andy that philanthropy
when practiced in a business way is an art that blesses him who gives
as well as him who receives

Great says I feeling fine Ill admit you are the doctor this
time

Well be leaving on the morning train says Andy Youd better get
your collars and cuffs and press clippings together

Great says I Ill be ready But Andy says I I wish I could
have met that Professor James Darnley McCorkle before we went I had a
curiosity to know that man

Thatll be easy says Andy turning around to the faro dealer

Jim says Andy shake hands with Mr Peters




THE HAND THAT RILES THE WORLD


Many of our great men said I apropos of many things have
declared that they owe their success to the aid and encouragement of
some brilliant woman

I know said Jeff Peters Ive read in history and mythology about
Joan of Arc and Mme Yale and Mrs Caudle and Eve and other noted
females of the past But in my opinion the woman of today is of
little use in politics or business Whats she best in anywaymen
make the best cooks milliners nurses housekeepers stenographers
clerks hairdressers and launderers About the only job left that a
woman can beat a man in is female impersonator in vaudeville

I would have thought said I that occasionally anyhow you would
have found the wit and intuition of woman valuable to you in your
lines oferbusiness

Now wouldnt you said Jeff with an emphatic nodwouldnt you
have imagined that But a woman is an absolutely unreliable partner in
any straight swindle Shes liable to turn honest on you when you are
depending upon her the most I tried em once

Bill Humble an old friend of mine in the Territories conceived
the illusion that he wanted to be appointed United States Marshall
At that time me and Andy was doing a square legitimate business of
selling walking canes If you unscrewed the head of one and turned it
up to your mouth a half pint of good rye whiskey would go trickling
down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence The
deputies was annoying me and Andy some and when Bill spoke to me
about his officious aspirations I saw how the appointment as Marshall
might help along the firm of Peters  Tucker


Illustration Selling walking canes


Jeff says Bill to me you are a man of learning and education
besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments
but facts and attainments

I do says I and I have never regretted it I am not one says
I who would cheapen education by making it free Tell me says I
which is of the most value to mankind literature or horse racing

Whyer playing the poI mean of course the poets and the
great writers have got the call of course says Bill

Exactly says I Then why do the master minds of finance and
philanthropy says I charge us 2 to get into a racetrack and let
us into a library free Is that distilling into the masses says
I a correct estimate of the relative value of the two means of
selfculture and disorder

You are arguing outside of my faculties of sense and rhetoric says
Bill What I wanted you to do is to go to Washington and dig out this
appointment for me I havent no ideas of cultivation and intrigue
Im a plain citizen and I need the job Ive killed seven men says
Bill Ive got nine children Ive been a good Republican ever since
the first of May I cant read nor write and I see no reason why I
aint illegible for the office And I think your partner Mr Tucker
goes on Bill is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected
system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment
I will give you preliminary says Bill 1000 for drinks bribes and
carfare in Washington If you land the job I will pay you 1000 more
cash down and guarantee you impunity in bootlegging whiskey for
twelve months Are you patriotic to the West enough to help me put this
thing through the Whitewashed Wigwam of the Great Father of the most
eastern flag station of the Pennsylvania Railroad says Bill


Illustration Im a plain citizen and I need the job


Well I talked to Andy about it and he liked the idea immense Andy
was a man of an involved nature He was never content to plod along
as I was selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination
steak beater shoe horn marcel waver monkey wrench nail file
potato masher and Multum in Parvo tuning fork Andy had the artistic
temper which is not to be judged as a preachers or a moral mans is
by purely commercial deflections So we accepted Bills offer and
strikes out for Washington

Says I to Andy when we get located at a hotel on South Dakota
Avenue GSSW Now Andy for the first time in our lives weve got
to do a real dishonest act Lobbying is something weve never been
used to but weve got to scandalize ourselves for Bill Humbles sake
In a straight and legitimate business says I we could afford
to introduce a little foul play and chicanery but in a disorderly
and heinous piece of malpractice like this it seems to me that the
straightforward and aboveboard way is the best I propose says I
that we hand over 500 of this money to the chairman of the national
campaign committee get a receipt lay the receipt on the Presidents
desk and tell him about Bill The President is a man who would
appreciate a candidate who went about getting office that way instead
of pulling wires

Andy agreed with me but after we talked the scheme over with the
hotel clerk we give that plan up He told us that there was only one
way to get an appointment in Washington and that was through a lady
lobbyist He gave us the address of one he recommended a Mrs Avery
who he said was high up in sociable and diplomatic rings and circles

The next morning at 10 oclock me and Andy called at her hotel and
was shown up to her reception room

This Mrs Avery was a solace and a balm to the eyesight She had hair
the color of the back of a twenty dollar gold certificate blue eyes
and a system of beauty that would make the girl on the cover of a July
magazine look like a cook on a Monongahela coal barge

She had on a low necked dress covered with silver spangles and
diamond rings and ear bobs Her arms was bare and she was using a
desk telephone with one hand and drinking tea with the other

Well boys says she after a bit what is it


Illustration Well boys what is it


I told her in as few words as possible what we wanted for Bill and
the price we could pay

Those western appointments says she are easy Leme see now
says she who could put that through for us No use fooling with the
Territorial delegates I guess says she that Senator Sniper would
be about the man Hes from somewheres in the West Lets see how he
stands on my private menu card She takes some papers out of a
pigeonhole with the letter S over it

Yes says she hes marked with a star that means ready to
serve Now lets see Age 55 married twice Presbyterian likes
blondes Tolstoi poker and stewed terrapin sentimental at third
bottle of wine Yes she goes on I am sure I can have your friend
Mr Bummer appointed Minister to Brazil

Humble says I And United States Marshal was the berth

Oh yes says Mrs Avery I have so many deals of this sort I
sometimes get them confused Give me all the memoranda you have of
the case Mr Peters and come back in four days I think it can be
arranged by then

So me and Andy goes back to our hotel and waits Andy walks up and
down and chews the left end of his mustache

A woman of high intellect and perfect beauty is a rare thing Jeff
says he

As rare says I as an omelet made from the eggs of the fabulous
bird known as the epidermis says I

A woman like that says Andy ought to lead a man to the highest
positions of opulence and fame

I misdoubt says I if any woman ever helped a man to secure a job
any more than to have his meals ready promptly and spread a report
that the other candidates wife had once been a shoplifter They are
no more adapted for business and politics says I than Algernon
Charles Swinburne is to be floor manager at one of Chuck Connors
annual balls I know says I to Andy that sometimes a woman seems
to step out into the kalsomine light as the charge daffaires of her
mans political job But how does it come out Say they have a neat
little berth somewhere as foreign consul of record to Afghanistan or
lockkeeper on the Delaware and Raritan Canal One day this man finds
his wife putting on her overshoes and three months supply of bird seed
into the canarys cage Sioux Falls he asks with a kind of hopeful
light in his eye No Arthur says she Washington Were wasted
here says she You ought to be Toady Extraordinary to the Court of
St Bridget or Head Porter of the Island of Porto Rico Im going to
see about it

Then this lady I says to Andy moves against the authorities at
Washington with her baggage and munitions consisting of five dozen
indiscriminating letters written to her by a member of the Cabinet
when she was 15 a letter of introduction from King Leopold to the
Smithsonian Institution and a pink silk costume with canary colored
spats

Well and then what I goes She has the letters printed in the
evening papers that match her costume she lectures at an informal
tea given in the palm room of the B  O Depot and then calls on the
President The ninth Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Labor the
first aidedecamp of the Blue Room and an unidentified colored man
are waiting there to grasp her by the handsand feet They carry her
out to SW B street and leave her on a cellar door That ends it
The next time we hear of her she is writing postcards to the Chinese
Minister asking him to get Arthur a job in a tea store

Then says Andy you dont think Mrs Avery will land the
Marshalship for Bill

I do not says I I do not wish to be a septic but I doubt if
she can do as well as you and me could have done

I dont agree with you says Andy Ill bet you she does Im
proud of having a higher opinion of the talent and the powers of
negotiation of ladies

We was back at Mrs Averys hotel at the time she appointed She was
looking pretty and fine enough as far as that went to make any man
let her name every officer in the country But I hadnt much faith in
looks so I was certainly surprised when she pulls out a document with
the great seal of the United States on it and William Henry Humble
in a fine big hand on the back

You might have had it the next day boys says Mrs Avery smiling
I hadnt the slightest trouble in getting it says she I just
asked for it thats all Now Id like to talk to you a while she
goes on but Im awfully busy and I know youll excuse me Ive got
an Ambassadorship two Consulates and a dozen other minor applications
to look after I can hardly find time to sleep at all Youll give my
compliments to Mr Humble when you get home of course

Well I handed her the 500 which she pitched into her desk drawer
without counting I put Bills appointment in my pocket and me and
Andy made our adieus

We started back for the Territory the same day We wired Bill Job
landed get the tall glasses ready and we felt pretty good

Andy joshed me all the way about how little I knew about women

All right says I Ill admit that she surprised me But its the
first time I ever knew one of em to manipulate a piece of business on
time without getting it bungled up in some way says I

Down about the edge of Arkansas I got out Bills appointment and
looked it over and then I handed it to Andy to read Andy read it
but didnt add any remarks to my silence

The paper was for Bill all right and a genuine document but it
appointed him postmaster of Dade City Fla

Me and Andy got off the train at Little Rock and sent Bills
appointment to him by mail Then we struck northeast toward Lake
Superior

I never saw Bill Humble after that




THE EXACT SCIENCE OF MATRIMONY


As I have told you before said Jeff Peters I never had much
confidence in the perfidiousness of woman As partners or coeducators
in the most innocent line of graft they are not trustworthy

They deserve the compliment said I I think they are entitled to
be called the honest sex

Why shouldnt they be said Jeff Theyve got the other sex either
grafting or working overtime for em Theyre all right in business
until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much
Then you want to have a flat footed heavy breathing man with sandy
whiskers five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an
understudy to take her desk Now there was that widow lady that me
and Andy Tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency
scheme we floated out in Cairo

When youve got enough advertising capitalsay a roll as big as the
little end of a wagon tonguetheres money in matrimonial agencies
We had about 6000 and we expected to double it in two months which
is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without
taking out a New Jersey charter

We fixed up an advertisement that read about like this


 Charming widow beautiful home loving 32 years possessing
 3000 cash and owning valuable country property would remarry
 Would prefer a poor man with affectionate disposition to one with
 means as she realizes that the solid virtues are oftenest to be
 found in the humble walks of life No objection to elderly man
 or one of homely appearance if faithful and true and competent
 to manage property and invest money with judgment Address with
 particulars

 Lonely
 Care of Peters  Tucker agents Cairo Ill


So far so pernicious says I when we had finished the literary
concoction And now says I where is the lady

Andy gives me one of his looks of calm irritation

Jeff says he I thought you had lost them ideas of realism in
your art Why should there be a lady When they sell a lot of watered
stock on Wall Street would you expect to find a mermaid in it What
has a matrimonial ad got to do with a lady

Now listen says I You know my rule Andy that in all my
illegitimate inroads against the legal letter of the law the article
sold must be existent visible producible In that way and by a
careful study of city ordinances and train schedules I have kept out
of all trouble with the police that a five dollar bill and a cigar
could not square Now to work this scheme weve got to be able to
produce bodily a charming widow or its equivalent with or without the
beauty hereditaments and appurtenances set forth in the catalogue and
writ of errors or hereafter be held by a justice of the peace

Well says Andy reconstructing his mind maybe it would be
safer in case the post office or the peace commission should try to
investigate our agency But where he says could you hope to find
a widow who would waste time on a matrimonial scheme that had no
matrimony in it

I told Andy that I thought I knew of the exact party An old friend
of mine Zeke Trotter who used to draw soda water and teeth in a
tent show had made his wife a widow a year before by drinking some
dyspepsia cure of the old doctors instead of the liniment that he
always got boozed up on I used to stop at their house often and I
thought we could get her to work with us

Twas only sixty miles to the little town where she lived so I
jumped out on the I C and finds her in the same cottage with the
same sunflowers and roosters standing on the washtub Mrs Trotter
fitted our ad first rate except maybe for beauty and age and property
valuation But she looked feasible and praiseworthy to the eye and it
was a kindness to Zekes memory to give her the job

Is this an honest deal you are putting on Mr Peters she asks me
when I tell her what we want

Mrs Trotter says I Andy Tucker and me have computed the
calculation that 3000 men in this broad and unfair country will
endeavor to secure your fair hand and ostensible money and property
through our advertisement Out of that number something like thirty
hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you
the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a
swindler and contemptible fortune seeker

Me and Andy says I propose to teach these preyers upon society
a lesson It was with difficulty says I that me and Andy could
refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the Great Moral
and Millennial Malevolent Matrimonial Agency Does that satisfy you

It does Mr Peters says she I might have known you wouldnt
have gone into anything that wasnt opprobrious But what will my
duties be Do I have to reject personally these 3000 ramscallions you
speak of or can I throw them out in bunches

Your job Mrs Trotter says I will be practically a cynosure
You will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do Andy and I
will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it

Of course says I some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors
who can raise the railroad fare may come to Cairo to personally press
their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing In that
case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out
face to face We will pay you 25 per week and hotel expenses

Give me five minutes says Mrs Trotter to get my powder rag and
leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary
begin

So I conveys Mrs Trotter to Cairo and establishes her in a family
hotel far enough away from mine and Andys quarters to be unsuspicious
and available and I tell Andy

Great says Andy And now that your conscience is appeased as to
the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside
suppose we revenoo a noo fish

So we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering
the country far and wide One ad was all we used We couldnt have
used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia
that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the
PostmasterGeneral

We placed 2000 in a bank to Mrs Trotters credit and gave her the
book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith
of the agency I knew Mrs Trotter was square and reliable and it was
safe to leave it in her name

With that one ad Andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering
letters

About one hundred a day was what came in I never knew there was so
many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to
acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money


Illustration About 100 a day was what came in


Most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost
jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure
that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the
widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em

Every applicant got a reply from Peters  Tucker informing him
that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and
interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more
particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient Peters  Tucker
also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second
letter to their fair client would be 2 enclosed therewith

There you see the simple beauty of the scheme About 90 per cent of
them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it
in That was all there was to it Except that me and Andy complained
an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them
envelopes and taking the money out

Some few clients called in person We sent em to Mrs Trotter and
she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike
us for carfare After the letters began to get in from the rfd
districts Andy and me were taking in about 200 a day

One afternoon when we were busiest and I was stuffing the two and
ones into cigar boxes and Andy was whistling No Wedding Bells for
Her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like
he was on the trail of a lost Gainesborough painting or two As soon
as I saw him I felt a glow of pride because we were running our
business on the level

I see you have quite a large mail today says the man

I reached and got my hat

Come on says I Weve been expecting you Ill show you the
goods How was Teddy when you left Washington

I took him down to the Riverview Hotel and had him shake hands with
Mrs Trotter Then I showed him her bank book with the 2000 to her
credit

It seems to be all right says the Secret Service

It is says I And if youre not a married man Ill leave you to
talk a while with the lady We wont mention the two dollars

Thanks says he If I wasnt I might Good day Mrs Peters

Toward the end of three months we had taken in something over 5000
and we saw it was time to quit We had a good many complaints made
to us and Mrs Trotter seemed to be tired of the job A good many
suitors had been calling to see her and she didnt seem to like that

So we decides to pull out and I goes down to Mrs Trotters hotel to
pay her last weeks salary and say farewell and get her check for the
2000

When I got there I found her crying like a kid that dont want to go
to school

Now now says I whats it all about Somebody sassed you or you
getting homesick

No Mr Peters says she Ill tell you You was always a friend
of Zekes and I dont mind Mr Peters Im in love I just love a
man so hard I cant bear not to get him Hes just the ideal Ive
always had in mind


Illustration Mr Peters Im in love


Then take him says I That is if its a mutual case Does he
return the sentiment according to the specifications and painfulness
you have described

He does says she But hes one of the gentlemen thats been
coming to see me about the advertisement and he wont marry me unless
I give him the 2000 His name is William Wilkinson And then she
goes off again in the agitations and hysterics of romance

Mrs Trotter says I theres no man more sympathizing with a
womans affections than I am Besides you was once the life partner
of one of my best friends If it was left to me Id say take this
2000 and the man of your choice and be happy

We could afford to do that because we have cleaned up over 5000
from these suckers that wanted to marry you But says I Andy
Tucker is to be consulted

He is a good man but keen in business He is my equal partner
financially I will talk to Andy says I and see what can be done

I goes back to our hotel and lays the case before Andy

I was expecting something like this all the time says Andy You
cant trust a woman to stick by you in any scheme that involves her
emotions and preferences

Its a sad thing Andy says I to think that weve been the cause
of the breaking of a womans heart

It is says Andy and I tell you what Im willing to do Jeff
Youve always been a man of a soft and generous heart and disposition
Perhaps Ive been too hard and worldly and suspicious For once Ill
meet you half way Go to Mrs Trotter and tell her to draw the 2000
from the bank and give it to this man shes infatuated with and be
happy

I jumps up and shakes Andys hand for five minutes and then I goes
back to Mrs Trotter and tells her and she cries as hard for joy as
she did for sorrow

Two days afterward me and Andy packed up to go

Wouldnt you like to go down and meet Mrs Trotter once before we
leave I asks him Shed like mightily to know you and express her
encomiums and gratitude

Why I guess not says Andy I guess wed better hurry and catch
that train

I was strapping our capital around me in a memory belt like we always
carried it when Andy pulls a roll of large bills out of his pocket
and asks me to put em with the rest

Whats this says I


Illustration Whats this says I


Its Mrs Trotters two thousand says Andy

How do you come to have it I asks

She gave it to me says Andy Ive been calling on her three
evenings a week for more than a month

Then are you William Wilkinson says I

I was says Andy




A MIDSUMMER MASQUERADE


Satan said Jeff Peters is a hard boss to work for When other
people are having their vacation is when he keeps you the busiest As
old Dr Watts or St Paul or some other diagnostician says He always
finds somebody for idle hands to do

I remember one summer when me and my partner Andy Tucker tried to
take a layoff from our professional and business duties but it seems
that our work followed us wherever we went

Now with a preacher its different He can throw off his
responsibilities and enjoy himself On the 31st of May he wraps
mosquito netting and tin foil around the pulpit grabs his niblick
breviary and fishing pole and hikes for Lake Como or Atlantic City
according to the size of the loudness with which he has been called by
his congregation And sir for three months he dont have to think
about business except to hunt around in Deuteronomy and Proverbs and
Timothy to find texts to cover and exculpate such little midsummer
penances as dropping a couple of looey door on rouge or teaching a
Presbyterian widow to swim

But I was going to tell you about mine and Andys summer vacation
that wasnt one

We was tired of finance and all the branches of unsanctified
ingenuity Even Andy whose brain rarely ever stopped working began
to make noises like a tennis cabinet

Heigh ho says Andy Im tired Ive got that steam up the yacht
Corsair and ho for the Riviera feeling I want to loaf and indict my
soul as Walt Whittier says I want to play pinochle with Merry del
Val or give a knouting to the tenants on my Tarrytown estates or do
a monologue at a Chautauqua picnic in kilts or something summery and
outside the line of routine and sandbagging

Patience says I Youll have to climb higher in the profession
before you can taste the laurels that crown the footprints of the
great captains of industry Now what Id like Andy says I would
be a summer sojourn in a mountain village far from scenes of larceny
labor and overcapitalization Im tired too and a month or so of
sinlessness ought to leave us in good shape to begin again to take
away the white mans burdens in the fall

Andy fell in with the rest cure at once so we struck the general
passenger agents of all the railroads for summer resort literature
and took a week to study out where we should go I reckon the first
passenger agent in the world was that man Genesis But there wasnt
much competition in his day and when he said The Lord made the
earth in six days and all very good he hadnt any idea to what
extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from
him later on

When we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the United
States from Passadumkeg Maine to El Paso and from Skagway to Key
West was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new
laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open
plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride

So me and Andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our
trunk and takes the 6 oclock Tortoise Flyer for Crow Knob a kind of
a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of Tennessee and North
Carolina


Illustration Dumps the books out of the back window


We was directed to a kind of private hotel called Woodchuck Inn and
thither me and Andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks
and stumps The Inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees
and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white
dresses rocking in the shade The rest of Crow Knob was a post office
and some scenery set an angle of fortyfive degrees and a welkin

Well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down
the walk to greet us Old Smokeemout Smithers who used to be the
best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the
Southwest

Old Smokeemout is dressed clericorural and has the mingled air
of a landlord and a claim jumper Which aspect he corroborates by
telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of Woodchuck Inn I
introduces Andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will
go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like
us three were Old Smokeemout leads us into a kind of summer house
in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on
all the chords with his mighty right

Gents says he Im glad to see you Maybe you can help me out
of a scrape Im getting a bit old for street work so I leased this
dogdays emporium so the good things would come to me Two weeks before
the season opened I gets a letter signed Lieut Peary and one from
the Duke of Marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the
summer

Well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery
it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous
from long association with icebergs and the Coburgs So I prints a
lot of handbills announcing that Woodchuck Inn would shelter these
distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it
leaked and I sends em out to towns around as far as Knoxville and
Charlotte and Fish Dam and Bowling Green

And now look up there on the porch gents says Smokeemout at
them disconsolate specimens of their fair sex waiting for the arrival
of the Duke and the Lieutenant The house is packed from rafters to
cellar with hero worshippers

Theres four normal school teachers and two abnormal theres three
high school graduates between 37 and 42 theres two literary old
maids and one that can write theres a couple of society women and
a lady from Haw River Two elocutionists are bunking in the corn
crib and Ive put cots in the hay loft for the cook and the society
editress of the Chattanooga _Opera Glass_ You see how names draw
gents

Well says I how is it that you seem to be biting your thumbs at
good luck You didnt use to be that way

I aint through says Smokeemout Yesterday was the day for
the advent of the auspicious personages I goes down to the depot to
welcome em Two apparently animate substances gets off the train
both carrying bags full of croquet mallets and these magic lanterns
with pushbuttons

I compares these integers with the original signatures to the letters
and well gents I reckon the mistake was due to my poor eyesight
Instead of being the Lieutenant the daisy chain and wild verbena
explorer was none other than Levi T Peevy a soda water clerk from
Asheville And the Duke of Marlborough turned out to be Theo Drake of
Murfreesborough a bookkeeper in a grocery What did I do I kicked
em both back on the train and watched em depart for the lowlands
the low


Illustration Instead of the Lieut and the Duke


Now you see the fix Im in gents goes on Smokeemout Smithers
I told the ladies that the notorious visitors had been detained on
the road by some unavoidable circumstances that made a noise like an
ice jam and an heiress but they would arrive a day or two later When
they find out that theyve been deceived says Smokeemout every
yard of cross barred muslin and natural waved switch in the house will
pack up and leave Its a hard deal says old Smokeemout

Friend says Andy touching the old man on the aesophagus why
this jeremiad when the polar regions and the portals of Blenheim are
conspiring to hand you prosperity on a hallmarked silver salver We
have arrived

A light breaks out on Smokeemouts face

Can you do it gents he asks Could ye do it Could ye play the
polar man and the little duke for the nice ladies Will ye do it


Illustration Can ye do it gents he asks


I see that Andy is superimposed with his old hankering for the oral
and polyglot system of buncoing That man had a vocabulary of about
10000 words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband
sophistries and parables when they came out

Listen says Andy to old Smokeemout Can we do it You behold
before you Mr Smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for
inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleightofhand
or swiftness of foot Dukes come and go explorers go and get lost
but me and Jeff Peters says Andy go after the comeons forever If
you say so were the two illustrious guests you were expecting And
youll find says Andy that well give you the true local color of
the title roles from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis

Old Smokeemout is delighted He takes me and Andy up to the inn by
an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can
and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long
as we would stay

On the porch Smokeemout says Ladies I have the honor to
introduce His Gracefulness the Duke of Marlborough and the famous
inventor of the North Pole Lieut Peary

The skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and Andy
bows and then goes on in with old Smokeemout to register And then
we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the
rooms hed been saving for us and got out a demijohn of North Carolina
real mountain dew

I expected trouble when Andy began to drink He has the artistic
metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on
airships when stimulated

After lingering with the demijohn me and Andy goes out on the porch
where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep We sit in two special
chairs and then the schoolmaams and literaterrers hunched their
rockers close around us

One lady says to me How did that last venture of yours turn out
sir

Now Id clean forgot to have an understanding with Andy which I
was to be the duke or the lieutenant And I couldnt tell from
her question whether she was referring to Arctic or matrimonial
expeditions So I gave an answer that would cover both cases

Well maam says I it was a freeze outright smart of a freeze
out maam

And then the flood gates of Andys perorations was opened and I knew
which one of the renowned ostensible guests I was supposed to be I
wasnt either Andy was both And still furthermore it seemed that
he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole British nobility and
of Arctic exploration from Sir John Franklin down It was the union
of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that Mr W D
Howletts admires so much

Ladies says Andy smiling semicircularly I am truly glad to
visit America I do not consider the magna charta says he or gas
balloons or snowshoes in any way a detriment to the beauty and charm
of your American women skyscrapers or the architecture of your
icebergs The next time says Andy that I go after the North Pole
all the Vanderbilts in Greenland wont be able to turn me out in the
coldI mean make it hot for me

Tell us about one of your trips Lieutenant says one of the
normals

Sure says Andy getting the decision over a hiccup It was in
the spring of last year that I sailed the Castle of Blenheim up to
latitude 87 degrees Fahrenheit and beat the record Ladies says
Andy it was a sad sight to see a Duke allied by a civil and
liturgical chattel mortgage to one of your first families lost in a
region of semiannual days And then he goes on At four bells we
sighted Westminster Abbey but there was not a drop to eat At noon we
threw out five sandbags and the ship rose fifteen knots higher At
midnight continues Andy the restaurants closed Sitting on a cake
of ice we ate seven hot dogs All around us was snow and ice Six
times a night the boatswain rose up and tore a leaf off the calendar
so we could keep time with the barometer At 12 says Andy with a
lot of anguish on his face three huge polar bears sprang down the
hatchway into the cabin And then

What then Lieutenant says a schoolmaam excitedly

Andy gives a loud sob

The Duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and
weeps on the porch

Well of course that fixed the scheme The women boarders all left
the next morning The landlord wouldnt speak to us for two days but
when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up

So me and Andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away
from Crow Knob with 1100 that we enticed out of old Smokeemout
playing seven up




SHEARING THE WOLF


Jeff Peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was
under discussion

The only times said he that me and Andy Tucker ever had any
hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral
aspects of grafting Andy had his standards and I had mine I didnt
approve of all of Andys schemes for levying contributions from the
public and he thought I allowed my conscience to interfere too often
for the financial good of the firm We had high arguments sometimes
One word led on to another till he said I reminded him of Rockefeller

I dont know how you mean that Andy says I but we have been
friends too long for me to take offense at a taunt that you will
regret when you cool off I have yet says I to shake hands with
a subpoena server

One summer me and Andy decided to rest up a spell in a fine little
town in the mountains of Kentucky called Grassdale We was supposed to
be horse drovers and good decent citizens besides taking a summer
vacation The Grassdale people liked us and me and Andy declared a
cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a
rubber concession prospectus or flashing a Brazilian diamond while we
was there

One day the leading hardware merchant of Grassdale drops around to
the hotel where me and Andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on
the side porch We knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the
afternoons in the court house yard He was a loud red man breathing
hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason


Illustration Pitching quoits in the afternoon in the court house
yard


After we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this Murkison
for such was his entitlementstakes a letter out of his coat pocket
in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read

Now what do you think of that says he laughinga letter like
that to ME

Me and Andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it
through It was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters
explaining how for 1000 you could get 5000 in bills that an expert
couldnt tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were
made from plates stolen by an employee of the Treasury at Washington

Think of em sending a letter like that to ME says Murkison again


Illustration Think of em sending a letter like that to ME


Lots of good men get em says Andy If you dont answer the
first letter they let you drop If you answer it they write again
asking you to come on with your money and do business

But think of em writing to ME says Murkison

A few days later he drops around again

Boys says he I know you are all right or I wouldnt confide in
you I wrote to them rascals again just for fun They answered and
told me to come on to Chicago They said telegraph to J Smith when I
would start When I get there Im to wait on a certain street corner
till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front
of me Then I am to ask him how the water is and he knows its me and
I know its him

Ah yes says Andy gaping its the same old game Ive often
read about it in the papers Then he conducts you to the private
abattoir in the hotel where Mr Jones is already waiting They show
you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one
You see em put it in a satchel for you and know its there Of course
its brown paper when you come to look at it afterward


Illustration Of course its brown paper


Oh they couldnt switch it on me says Murkison I havent built
up the best paying business in Grassdale without having witticisms
about me You say its real money they show you Mr Tucker

Ive alwaysI see by the papers that it always is says Andy

Boys says Murkison Ive got it in my mind that them fellows
cant fool me I think Ill put a couple of thousand in my jeans and
go up there and put it all over em If Bill Murkison gets his eyes
once on them bills they show him hell never take em off of em They
offer 5 for 1 and theyll have to stick to the bargain if I tackle
em Thats the kind of trader Bill Murkison is Yes I jist believe
Ill drop up Chicago way and take a 5 to 1 shot on J Smith I guess
the waterll be fine enough

Me and Andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of
Murkisons head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who
rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on Bryans election No
sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green
goods swindlers at their own game Maybe it would teach em a lesson

After Murkison left us me and Andy sat a while prepondering over our
silent meditations and heresies of reason In our idle hours we always
improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought

Jeff says Andy after a long time quite unseldom I have seen fit
to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about
your conscientious way of doing business I may have been often wrong
But here is a case where I think we can agree I feel that it would be
wrong for us to allow Mr Murkison to go alone to meet those Chicago
green goods men There is but one way it can end Dont you think we
would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent
the doing of this deed

I got up and shook Andy Tuckers hand hard and long

Andy says I I may have had one or two hard thoughts about the
heartlessness of your corporation but I retract em now You have a
kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all It does you
credit I was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed
It would not be honorable or praiseworthy says I for us to let
Murkison go on with this project he has taken up If he is determined
to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off

Andy agreed with me and I was glad to see that he was in earnest
about breaking up this green goods scheme

I dont call myself a religious man says I or a fanatic in
moral bigotry but I cant stand still and see a man who has built
up his business by his own efforts and brains and risk be robbed by
an unscrupulous trickster who is a menace to the public good

Right Jeff says Andy Well stick right along with Murkison if
he insists on going and block this funny business Id hate to see any
money dropped in it as bad as you would

Well we went to see Murkison

No boys says he I cant consent to let the song of this Chicago
siren waft by me on the summer breeze Ill fry some fat out of this
ignis fatuus or burn a hole in the skillet But Id be plumb diverted
to death to have you all go along with me Maybe you could help some
when it comes to cashing in the ticket to that 5 to 1 shot Yes Id
really take it as a pastime and regalement if you boys would go along
too

Murkison gives it out in Grassdale that he is going for a few days
with Mr Peters and Mr Tucker to look over some iron ore property in
West Virginia He wires J Smith that he will set foot in the spider
web on a given date and the three of us lights out for Chicago

On the way Murkison amuses himself with premonitions and advance
pleasant recollections

In a gray suit says he on the southwest corner of Wabash avenue
and Lake street He drops the paper and I ask how the water is Oh
my my my And then he laughs all over for five minutes

Sometimes Murkison was serious and tried to talk himself out of his
cogitations whatever they was

Boys says he I wouldnt have this to get out in Grassdale for
ten times a thousand dollars It would ruin me there But I know you
all are all right I think its the duty of every citizen says he
to try to do up these robbers that prey upon the public Ill show
em whether the waters fine Five dollars for onethats what J
Smith offers and hell have to keep his contract if he does business
with Bill Murkison

We got into Chicago about 7 PM Murkison was to meet the gray man at
half past 9 We had dinner at a hotel and then went up to Murkisons
room to wait for the time to come

Now boys says Murkison lets get our gumption together and
inoculate a plan for defeating the enemy Suppose while Im exchanging
airy bandage with the gray capper you gents come along by accident
you know and holler Hello Murk and shake hands with symptoms of
surprise and familiarity Then I take the capper aside and tell him
you all are Jenkins and Brown of Grassdale groceries and feed good
men and maybe willing to take a chance while away from home

Bring em along hell say of course if they care to invest
Now how does that scheme strike you

What do you say Jeff says Andy looking at me

Why Ill tell you what I say says I I say lets settle this
thing right here now I dont see any use of wasting any more time I
took a nickelplated 38 out of my pocket and clicked the cylinder
around a few times

You undevout sinful insidious hog says I to Murkison get out
that two thousand and lay it on the table Obey with velocity says
I for otherwise alternatives are impending I am preferably a man of
mildness but now and then I find myself in the middle of extremities
Such men as you I went on after he had laid the money out is what
keeps the jails and court houses going You come up here to rob these
men of their money Does it excuse you I asks that they were
trying to skin you No sir you was going to rob Peter to stand off
Paul You are ten times worse says I than that green goods man
You go to church at home and pretend to be a decent citizen but
youll come to Chicago and commit larceny from men that have built
up a sound and profitable business by dealing with such contemptible
scoundrels as you have tried to be today How do you know says I
that that green goods man hasnt a large family dependent upon his
extortions Its you supposedly respectable citizens who are always
on the lookout to get something for nothing says I that support
the lotteries and wildcat mines and stock exchanges and wire tappers
of this country If it wasnt for you theyd go out of business
The green goods man you was going to rob says I studied maybe
for years to learn his trade Every turn he makes he risks his money
and liberty and maybe his life You come up here all sanctified and
vanoplied with respectability and a pleasing post office address to
swindle him If he gets the money you can squeal to the police If
you get it he hocks the gray suit to buy supper and says nothing Mr
Tucker and me sized you up says I and came along to see that you
got what you deserved Hand over the money says I you grass fed
hypocrite

I put the two thousand which was all in 20 bills in my inside
pocket

Now get out your watch says I to Murkison No I dont want
it says I Lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it
ticks off an hour Then you can go If you make any noise or leave
any sooner well handbill you all over Grassdale I guess your high
position there is worth more than 2000 to you

Then me and Andy left

On the train Andy was a long time silent Then he says Jeff do you
mind my asking you a question

Two says I or forty

Was that the idea you had says he when we started out with
Murkison

Why certainly says I What else could it have been Wasnt it
yours too

In about half an hour Andy spoke again I think there are times when
Andy dont exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene

Jeff says he some time when you have the leisure I wish youd
draw off a diagram and footnotes of that conscience of yours Id
like to have it to refer to occasionally




INNOCENTS OF BROADWAY


I hope some day to retire from business said Jeff Peters and when
I do I dont want anybody to be able to say that I ever got a dollar
of any mans money without giving him a quid pro rata for it Ive
always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his
scrapbook or stick between his Seth Thomas clock and the wall after we
are through trading

There was one time I came near having to break this rule of mine and
do a profligate and illaudable action but I was saved from it by the
laws and statutes of our great and profitable country

One summer me and Andy Tucker my partner went to New York to lay in
our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings We was always
pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than
anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad
schedules and an autograph photo of the President that Loeb sent us
probably by mistake Andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in
about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times Loeb
must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the
photo Anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of
good faith

Me and Andy never cared much to do business in New York It was
too much like pothunting Catching suckers in that town is like
dynamiting a Texas lake for bass All you have to do anywhere between
the North and East rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag
marked Drop packages of money here No checks or loose bills taken
You have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office
orders and Canadian money and thats all there is to New York for a
hunter who loves his profession So me and Andy used to just nature
fake the town Wed get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks
along the Broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs
and then wed sneak away without firing a shot

One day in the papier mache palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops
agency in a side street about eight inches off Broadway me and Andy
had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a New Yorker We had beer
together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named
Hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in Duluth This caused us to
remark that the world was a very small place and then this New Yorker
busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and
starts in giving us his Ellen Terris beginning with the time he used
to sell shoelaces to the Indians on the spot where Tammany Hall now
stands

This New Yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in Beekman
street and he hadnt been above Fourteenth street in ten years
Moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport
will do anything to a man with whiskers No grafter except a boy who
is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize
air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man
behind with the razor He was a typical city ReubId bet the man
hadnt been out of sight of a skyscraper in twentyfive years

Well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of
bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and
opens it up

Theres 5000 Mr Peters says he shoving it over the table
to me saved during my fifteen years of business Put that in your
pocket and keep it for me Mr Peters Im glad to meet you gentlemen
from the West and I may take a drop too much I want you to take care
of my money for me Now lets have another beer


Illustration I want you to take care of my money for me


Youd better keep this yourself says I We are strangers to
you and you cant trust everybody you meet Put your roll back in
your pocket says I And youd better run along home before some
farmhand from the Kaw River bottoms strolls in here and sells you
a copper mine

Oh I dont know says Whiskers I guess Little Old New York can
take care of herself I guess I know a man thats on the square when I
see him Ive always found the Western people all right I ask you as
a favor Mr Peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for
me I know a gentleman when I see him And now lets have some more
beer

In about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and
snores Andy looks at me and says I reckon Id better stay with him
for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in

I went out the side door and walked half a block up the street And
then I came back and sat down at the table

Andy says I I cant do it Its too much like swearing off
taxes I cant go off with this mans money without doing something to
earn it like taking advantage of the Bankrupt act or leaving a bottle
of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square
deal

Well says Andy it does seem kind of hard on ones professional
pride to lope off with a bearded pards competency especially after
he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance
of his urban indiscrimination Suppose we wake him up and see if we
can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to
give us both his money and a good excuse

We wakes up Whiskers He stretches himself and yawns out the
hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute And then he
says he wouldnt mind sitting in at a little gentlemans game of
poker He used to play some when he attended high school in Brooklyn
and as he was out for a good time whyand so forth

Andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a
solution to our financial troubles So we all three go to our hotel
further down Broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to
Andys room I tried once more to make this Babe in the Horticultural
Gardens take his five thousand But no

Keep that little roll for me Mr Peters says he and oblige
Ill ask you fer it when I want it I guess I know when Im among
friends A man thats done business on Beekman street for twenty
years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to
know what hes about I guess I can tell a gentleman from a con man or
a flimflammer when I meet him Ive got some odd change in my clothes
enough to start the game with I guess

He goes through his pockets and rains 20 gold certificates on the
table till it looked like a 10000 Autumn Day in a Lemon Grove
picture by Turner in the salons Andy almost smiled

The first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his
hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot

Andy always took a pride in his poker playing He got up from the
table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars

Well gentlemen says the cigar man I dont blame you for not
wanting to play Ive forgotten the fine points of the game I guess
its been so long since I indulged Now how long are you gentlemen
going to be in the city

I told him about a week longer He says thatll suit him fine His
cousin is coming over from Brooklyn that evening and they are going to
see the sights of New York His cousin he says is in the artificial
limb and lead casket business and hasnt crossed the bridge in eight
years They expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by
asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day I tried to
make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it

Ill use what Ive got in loose change says he You keep the rest
for me Ill drop in on you and Mr Tucker tomorrow afternoon about 6
or 7 says he and well have dinner together Be good

After Whiskers had gone Andy looked at me curious and doubtful

Well Jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed
us two Elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to
have the Audubon Society after us It wont do to put the crown aside
too often I know this is something like paternalism but dont you
think Opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at
our door

I put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an
attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts

Andy says I this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a
predicament We cant move hand or foot with his money You and me
have got a gentlemans agreement with Fortune that we cant break
Weve done business in the West where its more of a fair game Out
there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and
the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up Goldfields
But theres little sport in New York city for rod reel or gun They
hunt here with either one of two thingsa slungshot or a letter of
introduction The town has been stocked so full of carp that the game
fish are all gone If you spread a net here do you catch legitimate
suckers in it such as the Lord intended to be caughtfresh guys who
know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another
mans game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or
two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is No
sir says I What the grafters live on here is widows and orphans
and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the
first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls
and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business
on Thats what they call suckers here Theyre nothing but canned
sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and
a soda cracker

Now this cigar man I went on is one of the types Hes lived
twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would
in getting a onceover shave from a lockjawed barber in a Kansas
crossroads town But hes a New Yorker and hell brag about that all
the time when he isnt picking up live wires or getting in front of
street cars or paying out money to wiretappers or standing under a
safe thats being hoisted into a skyscraper When a New Yorker does
loosen up says I its like the spring decomposition of the ice
jam in the Allegheny River Hell swamp you with cracked ice and
backwater if you dont get out of the way

Its mighty lucky for us Andy says I that this cigar exponent
with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike
trust and altruism For says I this money of his is an eyesore to
my sense of rectitude and ethics We cant take it Andy you know
we cant says I for we havent a shadow of a title to itnot a
shadow If there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim
to it Id be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and
make another 5000 for himself but we havent sold him anything
we havent been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial He
approached us friendly says I and with blind and beautiful idiocy
laid the stuff in our hands Well have to give it back to him when he
wants it


Illustration We cant take it Andy


Your arguments says Andy are past criticism or comprehension
No we cant walk off with the moneyas things now stand I admire
your conscious way of doing business Jeff says Andy and I
wouldnt propose anything that wasnt square in line with your
theories of morality and initiative

But Ill be away tonight and most of tomorrow Jeff says Andy
Ive got some business affairs that I want to attend to When this
free greenbacks party comes in tomorrow afternoon hold him here till
I arrive Weve all got an engagement for dinner you know

Well sir about 5 the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with
his eyes half open

Been having a glorious time Mr Peters says he Took in all the
sights I tell you New York is the onliest only Now if you dont
mind says he Ill lie down on that couch and doze off for about
nine minutes before Mr Tucker comes Im not used to being up all
night And tomorrow if you dont mind Mr Peters Ill take that
five thousand I met a man last night thats got a sure winner at
the racetrack tomorrow Excuse me for being so impolite as to go to
sleep Mr Peters

And so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes
himself and begins to snore while I sit there musing over things and
wishing I was back in the West where you could always depend on a
customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience
take it from him

At halfpast 5 Andy comes in and sees the sleeping form

Ive been over to Trenton says Andy pulling a document out of his
pocket I think Ive got this matter fixed up all right Jeff Look
at that

I open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued
by the State of New Jersey to The Peters  Tucker Consolidated and
Amalgamated Aerial Franchise Development Company Limited

Its to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained Andy
The Legislature wasnt in session but I found a man at a postcard
stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand There are
100000 shares says Andy expected to reach a par value of 1 I
had one blank certificate of stock printed

Andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain
pen

The whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for
5000 Did you learn his name

Make it out to bearer says I

We put the certificate of stock in the cigar mans hand and went out
to pack our suit cases


Illustration We put the certificate of stock in the cigarmans
hand


On the ferryboat Andy says to me Is your conscience easy about
taking the money now Jeff

Why shouldnt it be says I Are we any better than any other
Holding Corporation




CONSCIENCE IN ART


I never could hold my partner Andy Tucker down to legitimate ethics
of pure swindling said Jeff Peters to me one day

Andy had too much imagination to be honest He used to devise schemes
of moneygetting so fraudulent and highfinancial that they wouldnt
have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system

Myself I never believed in taking any mans dollars unless I gave
him something for itsomething in the way of rolled gold jewelry
garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a
crack on the head to show for his money I guess I must have had New
England ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and
rugged fear of the police

But Andys family tree was in different kind I dont think he could
have traced his descent any further back than a corporation

One summer while we was in the middle West working down the Ohio
valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach
destroyer Andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable
financiering

Jeff says he Ive been thinking that we ought to drop these
rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing
and prolific If we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg
money well be classed as nature fakers How about plunging into the
fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous
in the chest

Well says I you know my idiosyncrasies I prefer a square
nonillegal style of business such as we are carrying on now When I
take money I want to leave some tangible object in the other fellows
hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor
even if its only a Komical Kuss Trick Finger Ring for Squirting
Perfume in a Friends Eye But if youve got a fresh idea Andy says
I lets have a look at it Im not so wedded to petty graft that I
would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy

I was thinking says Andy of a little hunt without horn hound or
camera among the great herd of the Midas Americanus commonly known as
the Pittsburg millionaires

In New York I asks

No sir says Andy in Pittsburg Thats their habitat They dont
like New York They go there now and then just because its expected
of em

A Pittsburg millionaire in New York is like a fly in a cup of hot
coffeehe attracts attention and comment but he dont enjoy it New
York ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks
and snobs and sneers The truth is he dont spend anything while he
is there I saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to Bunkum
Town made by a Pittsburg man worth 15000000 once Heres the way he
set it down


 R R fare to and from          21 00
 Cab fare to and from hotel       2 00
 Hotel bill  5 per day        50 00
 Tips                  5750 00
 
 Total                5823 00


Thats the voice of New York goes on Andy The towns nothing but
a head waiter If you tip it too much itll go and stand by the door
and make fun of you to the hat check boy When a Pittsburger wants to
spend money and have a good time he stays at home Thats where well
go to catch him

Well to make a dense story more condensed me and Andy cached our
paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friends cellar
and took the trail to Pittsburg Andy didnt have any especial
prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had
plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any
occasion that presented itself

As a concession to my ideas of selfpreservation and rectitude he
promised that if I should take an active and incriminating part in
any little business venture that we might work up there should be
something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or
smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might
rest easy After that I felt better and entered more cheerfully into
the foul play

Andy says I as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath
they call Smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to
get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers Not that
I would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and
work with the olive fork and pie knife says I but isnt the entree
nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you
imagined

If theres any handicap at all says Andy its our own refinement
and inherent culture Pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain
wholehearted unassuming democratic men

They are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways
are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal
of impoliteness and discourtesy Nearly every one of em rose from
obscurity says Andy and theyll live in it till the town gets to
using smoke consumers If we act simple and unaffected and dont go
too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty
on steel rails we wont have any trouble in meeting some of em
socially

Well Andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our
bearings We got to knowing several millionaires by sight

One used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a
quart of champagne brought out to him When the waiter opened it hed
turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle That showed he
used to be a glassblower before he made his money

One evening Andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner About 11
oclock he came into my room

Landed one Jeff says he Twelve millions Oil rolling mills
real estate and natural gas Hes a fine man no airs about him Made
all his money in the last five years Hes got professors posting him
up now in educationart and literature and haberdashery and such
things

When I saw him hed just won a bet of 10000 with a Steel
Corporation man that thered be four suicides in the Allegheny rolling
mills today So everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on
him He took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him We went to
a restaurant in Diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling
Moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters

Then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on Liberty street
Hes got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on
the next floor above He told me it cost him 18000 to furnish his
apartment and I believe it

Hes got 40000 worth of pictures in one room and 20000 worth of
curios and antiques in another His names Scudder and hes 45 and
taking lessons on the piano and 15000 barrels of oil a day out of his
wells

All right says I Preliminary canter satisfactory But kay
vooly voo What good is the art junk to us And the oil

Now that man says Andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed aint
what you would call an ordinary scutt When he was showing me his
cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke
oven He says that if some of his big deals go through hell make
J P Morgans collection of sweatshop tapestry and Augusta Me
beadwork look like the contents of an ostrichs craw thrown on a
screen by a magic lantern

And then he showed me a little carving went on Andy that anybody
could see was a wonderful thing It was something like 2000 years
old he said It was a lotus flower with a womans face in it carved
out of a solid piece of ivory

Scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it An Egyptian
carver named Khafra made two of em for King Rameses II about the
year BC The other one cant be found The junkshops and antique bugs
have rubbered all Europe for it but it seems to be out of stock
Scudder paid 2000 for the one he has

Oh well says I this sounds like the purling of a rill to me I
thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of
learning art from em

Be patient says Andy kindly Maybe we will see a rift in the
smoke ere long

All the next morning Andy was out I didnt see him until about noon
He came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall He
pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket
and unwrapped it It was an ivory carving just as he had described the
millionaires to me

I went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says
Andy and I see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and
truck The pawnbroker said hed had it several years and thinks it was
soaked by some Arabs or Turks or some foreign dubs that used to live
down by the river

I offered him 2 for it and I must have looked like I wanted it
for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his childrens
mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of
35 I finally got it for 25

Jeff goes on Andy this is the exact counterpart of Scudders
carving Its absolutely a dead ringer for it Hell pay 2000 for it
as quick as hed tuck a napkin under his chin And why shouldnt it be
the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out

Why not indeed says I And how shall we go about compelling him
to make a voluntary purchase of it

Andy had his plan all ready and Ill tell you how we carried it out

I got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled
my hair up and became Prof Pickleman I went to another hotel
registered and sent a telegram to Scudder to come to see me at once
on important art business The elevator dumped him on me in less
than an hour He was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of
Connecticut wrappers and naphtha

Hello Profess he shouts Hows your conduct

I rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare

Sir says I are you Cornelius T Scudder Of Pittsburg
Pennsylvania

I am says he Come out and have a drink

Ive neither the time nor the desire says I for such harmful
and deleterious amusements I have come from New York says I on a
matter of busion a matter of art

I learned there that you are the owner of an Egyptian ivory carving
of the time of Rameses II representing the head of Queen Isis in a
lotus flower There were only two of such carvings made One has been
lost for many years I recently discovered and purchased the other in
a pawnin an obscure museum in Vienna I wish to purchase yours Name
your price

Well the great ice jams Profess says Scudder Have you found
the other one Me sell No I dont guess Cornelius Scudder needs to
sell anything that he wants to keep Have you got the carving with
you Profess

I shows it to Scudder He examines it careful all over

Its the article says he Its a duplicate of mine every line
and curve of it Tell you what Ill do he says I wont sell but
Ill buy Give you 2500 for yours

Since you wont sell I will says I Large bills please Im a
man of few words I must return to New York tonight I lecture
tomorrow at the aquarium

Scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it He goes off with
his piece of antiquity and I hurry back to Andys hotel according to
arrangement

Andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch

Well he says

Twentyfive hundred says I Cash

Weve got just eleven minutes says Andy to catch the B  O
westbound Grab your baggage

Whats the hurry says I It was a square deal And even if it was
only an imitation of the original carving itll take him some time to
find it out He seemed to be sure it was the genuine article

It was says Andy It was his own When I was looking at his
curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and I
pocketed it Now will you pick up your suit case and hurry

Then says I why was that story about finding another one in the
pawn

Oh says Andy out of respect for that conscience of yours Come
on




THE MAN HIGHER UP


Across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of Provenzanos
restaurant Jeff Peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft

Every winter Jeff comes to New York to eat spaghetti to watch the
shipping in East River from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat
and to lay in a supply of Chicagomade clothing at one of the Fulton
street stores During the other three seasons he may be found further
westhis range is from Spokane to Tampa In his profession he
takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and
unique philosophy of ethics His profession is no new one He is an
incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of
the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen

In the wilderness of stone in which Jeff seeks his annual lonely
holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will
whistle after sundown in a wood Wherefore I mark on my calendar the
time of his coming and open a question of privilege at Provenzanos
concerning the little winestained table in the corner between the
rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the
wall

There are two kinds of graft said Jeff that ought to be wiped out
by law I mean Wall Street speculation and burglary

Nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said I with
a laugh

Well burglary ought to be wiped out too said Jeff and I wondered
whether the laugh had been redundant

About three months ago said Jeff it was my privilege to become
familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of
illegitimate art I was _sine qua grata_ with a member of the
housebreakers union and one of the John D Napoleons of finance at
the same time

Interesting combination said I with a yawn Did I tell you I
bagged a duck and a groundsquirrel at one shot last week over in the
Ramapos I knew well how to draw Jeffs stories

Let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of
society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upaslike
eye said Jeff with the pure gleam of the muckraker in his own

As I said three months ago I got into bad company There are two
times in a mans life when he does thiswhen hes dead broke and
when hes rich

Now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck It was
out in Arkansas I made the wrong turn at a crossroad and drives into
this town of Peavine by mistake It seems I had already assaulted and
disfigured Peavine the spring of the year before I had sold 600
worth of young fruit trees thereplums cherries peaches and pears
The Peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping I
might pass that way again I drove down Main street as far as the
Crystal Palace drugstore before I realized I had committed ambush upon
myself and my white horse Bill

The Peaviners took me by surprise and Bill by the bridle and began
a conversation that wasnt entirely disassociated with the subject
of fruit trees A committee of em ran some tracechains through
the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and
orchards

Their fruit trees hadnt lived up to their labels Most of em had
turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of
blackjacks and poplars The only one that showed any signs of bearing
anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornets
nest and half of an old corsetcover

The Peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town
They took my watch and money on account and they kept Bill and the
wagon as hostages They said the first time one of them dogwood trees
put forth an Amsdens June peach I might come back and get my things
Then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the
direction of the Rocky Mountains and I struck a Lewis and Clark lope
for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests

When I regained intellectualness I found myself walking into an
unidentified town on the A T  S F railroad The Peaviners hadnt
left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewingthey wasnt
after my lifeand that saved it I bit off a chunk and sits down on a
pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and
perspicacity

And then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the
town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards
in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and
interjections I see it is a young man broad across the face dressed
more for Pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in
spite of it all that made Phoebe Snows job look like a chimneysweeps

Fall off says I

Nunk says he Got off Arrived at my destination What town is
this

Havent looked it up on the map yet says I I got in about five
minutes before you did How does it strike you

Hard says he twisting one of his arms around I believe that
shoulderno its all right

He stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his
pocket drops a fine nineinch burglars steel jimmy He picks it up
and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand

Brother says he greetings Didnt I see you in Southern Missouri
last summer selling colored sand at halfadollar a teaspoonful to put
into lamps to keep the oil from exploding

Oil says I never explodes Its the gas that forms that
explodes But I shakes hands with him anyway

My names Bill Bassett says he to me and if youll call it
professional pride instead of conceit Ill inform you that you have
the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gumshoe on
ground drained by the Mississippi River

Well me and this Bill Bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags
as artists in kindred lines will do It seems he didnt have a cent
either and we went into close caucus He explained why an able
burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a
servant girl had played him false in Little Rock and he was making
a quick getaway

Its part of my business says Bill Bassett to play up to the
ruffles when I want to make a riffle as Raffles Tis loves that makes
the bit go round Show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty
parlormaid and you might as well call the silver melted down and
sold and me spilling truffles and that Chateau stuff on the napkin
under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just
because the old ladys nephew teaches a Bible class I first make an
impression on the girl says Bill and when she lets me inside I
make an impression on the locks But this one in Little Rock done me
says he She saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when
I came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it
was fast And I had keys made for the doors upstairs But no sir She
had sure cut off my locks She was a Delilah says Bill Bassett

It seems that Bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the
girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the topriders of a
tallyho and Bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the
depot As he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure
but he made a train that was just pulling out

Well says Bill Bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead
lives I could eat This town dont look like it was kept under a
Yale lock Suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in
temporary expense money I dont suppose youve brought along any hair
tonic or rolled gold watchchains or similar lawdefying swindles
that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic
populace have you

No says I I left an elegant line of Patagonian diamond earrings
and rainyday sunbursts in my valise at Peavine But theyre to stay
there until some of those blackgum trees begin to glut the market
with yellow clings and Japanese plums I reckon we cant count on them
unless we take Luther Burbank in for a partner

Very well says Bassett well do the best we can Maybe after
dark Ill borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the Farmers and
Drovers Marine Bank with it

While we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near
by A person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and
comes tripping down the track towards us He was a little fat man
with a big nose and rats eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a
handsatchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it He
passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the
town

Come on says Bill Bassett to me starting after him

Where I asks

Lordy says Bill had you forgot you was in the desert Didnt you
see Colonel Manna drop down right before your eyes Dont you hear the
rustling of General Ravens wings Im surprised at you Elijah

We overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was
after sundown and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him Bill
takes the silk hat off the mans head and brushes it with his sleeve
and puts it back

What does this mean sir says the man

When I wore one of these says Bill and felt embarrassed I
always done that Not having one now I had to use yours I hardly know
how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but I guess
well try your pockets first

Bill Bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted

Not even a watch he says Aint you ashamed of yourself you
whited sculpture Going about dressed like a headwaiter and financed
like a Count You havent even got carfare What did you do with your
transfer

The man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any
sort But Bassett takes his handsatchel and opens it Out comes some
collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out Bill
reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the heldup
party

Brother says he greetings Accept the apologies of friends I am
Bill Bassett the burglar Mr Peters you must make the acquaintance
of Mr Alfred E Ricks Shake hands Mr Peters says Bill stands
about halfway between me and you Mr Ricks in the line of havoc and
corruption He always gives something for the money he gets Im glad
to meet you Mr Ricksyou and Mr Peters This is the first time
I ever attended a full gathering of the National Synod of Sharks
housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented Please
examine Mr Ricks credentials Mr Peters

The piece of newspaper that Bill Bassett handed me had a good picture
of this Ricks on it It was a Chicago paper and it had obloquies
of Ricks in every paragraph By reading it over I harvested the
intelligence that said alleged Ricks had laid off all that portion of
the State of Florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em
to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices
in Chicago After he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one
of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble Ive had
em actually try gold watches Ive sold em with acid took a cheap
excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to
look at his lot and see if it didnt need a new paling or two on the
fence and market a few lemons in time for the Christmas present
trade He hires a surveyor to find his lot for him They run the line
out and find the flourishing town of Paradise Hollow so advertised
to be about 40 rods and 16 poles S 27 degrees E of the middle of
Lake Okeechobee This mans lot was under thirtysix feet of water
and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars
that his title looked fishy

Naturally the man goes back to Chicago and makes it as hot for
Alfred E Ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the
weather bureau Ricks defied the allegation but he couldnt deny
the alligators One morning the papers came out with a column about
it and Ricks come out by the fireescape It seems the alleged
authorities had beat him to the safedeposit box where he kept his
winnings and Ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen
15andahalf English pokes in his shopping bag He happened to have
some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town
in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and Bill Bassett as
Elijah III with not a raven in sight for any of us

Then this Alfred E Ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too
and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the
price of a meal And so there was the three of us representing if
we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and
capital Now when trade has no capital there isnt a dicker to be
made And when capital has no money theres a stagnation in steak and
onions That put it up to the man with the jimmy

Brother bushrangers says Bill Bassett never yet in trouble
did I desert a pal Hard by in yon wood I seem to see unfurnished
lodgings Let us go there and wait till dark

There was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took
possession of it After dark Bill Bassett tells us to wait and goes
out for half an hour He comes back with a armful of bread and
spareribs and pies

Panhandled em at a farmhouse on Washita Avenue says he Eat
drink and be leary

The full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the
cabin and ate in the light of it And this Bill Bassett begins to
brag

Sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce I
lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in
the profession than I am Now what could either of you have done in
the present emergency to set us on our feet again Could you do it
Ricksy

I must confess Mr Bassett says Ricks speaking nearly inaudible
out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture I could
not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation Large
operations such as I direct naturally require careful preparation in
advance I

I know Ricksy breaks in Bill Bassett You neednt finish You
need 500 to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four
roomsful of quartered oak furniture And you need 500 more for
advertising contracts And you need two weeks time for the fish to
begin to bite Your line of relief would be about as useful in an
emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated
by eightycent gas And your graft aint much swifter Brother
Peters he winds up

Oh says I I havent seen you turn anything into gold with your
wand yet Mr Good Fairy Most anybody could rub the magic ring for
a little leftover victuals

That was only getting the pumpkin ready says Bassett braggy
and cheerful The coach and sixll drive up to the door before you
know it Miss Cinderella Maybe youve got some scheme under your
sleeveholders that will give us a start

Son says I Im fifteen years older than you are and young
enough yet to take out an endowment policy Ive been broke before We
can see the lights of that town not half a mile away I learned under
Montague Silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon
There are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with
grease spots on their clothes Give me a gasoline lamp a drygoods
box and a twodollar bar of white castile soap cut into little

Wheres your two dollars snickered Bill Bassett into my discourse
There was no use arguing with that burglar

No he goes on youre both babesinthewood Finance has closed
the mahogany desk and trade has put the shutters up Both of you look
to labor to start the wheels going All right You admit it Tonight
Ill show you what Bill Bassett can do

Bassett tells me and Ricks not to leave the cabin till he comes back
even if its daylight and then he starts off toward town whistling
gay

This Alfred E Ricks pulls off his shoes and his coat lays a silk
handkerchief over his hat and lays down on the floor

I think I will endeavor to secure a little slumber he squeaks
The day has been fatiguing Goodnight my dear Mr Peters

My regards to Morpheus says I I think Ill sit up a while

About two oclock as near as I could guess by my watch in Peavine
home comes our laboring man and kicks up Ricks and calls us to the
streak of bright moonlight shining in the cabin door Then he spreads
out five packages of one thousand dollars each on the floor and
begins to cackle over the nestegg like a hen

Ill tell you a few things about that town says he Its named
Rocky Springs and theyre building a Masonic temple and it looks
like the Democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a
Pop and Judge Tuckers wife who has been down with pleurisy is
getting some better I had a talk on these liliputian thesises before
I could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that I was after
And theres a bank there called the Lumbermans Fidelity and Plowmans
Savings Institution It closed for business yesterday with 23000
cash on hand It will open this morning with 18000all silver
thats the reason I didnt bring more There you are trade and
capital Now will you be bad

My young friend says Alfred E Ricks holding up his hands have
you robbed this bank Dear me dear me

You couldnt call it that says Bassett Robbing sounds harsh
All I had to do was to find out what street it was on That town is so
quiet that I could stand on the corner and hear the tumblers clicking
in that safe lockright to 45 left twice to 80 right once to
60 left to 15as plain as the Yale captain giving orders in the
football dialect Now boys says Bassett this is an early rising
town They tell me the citizens are all up and stirring before
daylight I asked what for and they said because breakfast was ready
at that time And what of merry Robin Hood It must be Yoicks and
away with the tinkers chorus Ill stake you How much do you want
Speak up Capital

My dear young friend says this ground squirrel of a Ricks
standing on his hind legs and juggling nuts in his paws I have
friends in Denver who would assist me If I had a hundred dollars I

Basset unpins a package of the currency and throws five twenties to
Ricks

Trade how much he says to me

Put your money up Labor says I I never yet drew upon honest
toil for its hardearned pittance The dollars I get are surplus ones
that are burning the pockets of damfools and greenhorns When I stand
on a street corner and sell a solid gold diamond ring to a yap for
300 I make just 260 And I know hes going to give it to a girl
in return for all the benefits accruing from a 12500 ring His
profits are 12200 Which of us is the biggest fakir

And when you sell a poor woman a pinch of sand for fifty cents to
keep her lamp from exploding says Bassett what do you figure her
gross earnings to be with sand at forty cents a ton

Listen says I I instruct her to keep her lamp clean and well
filled If she does that it cant burst And with the sand in it
she knows it cant and she dont worry Its a kind of Industrial
Christian Science She pays fifty cents and gets both Rockefeller and
Mrs Eddy on the job It aint everybody that can let the golddust
twins do their work

Alfred E Ricks all but licks the dust off of Bill Bassetts shoes

My dear young friend says he I will never forget your
generosity Heaven will reward you But let me implore you to turn
from your ways of violence and crime

Mousie says Bill the hole in the wainscoting for yours Your
dogmas and inculcations sound to me like the last words of a bicycle
pump What has your high moral elevatorservice system of pillage
brought you to Penuriousness and want Even Brother Peters who
insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with theories of
commerce and trade admitted he was on the lift Both of you live by
the gilded rule Brother Peters says Bill youd better choose a
slice of this embalmed currency Youre welcome

I told Bill Bassett once more to put his money in his pocket I never
had the respect for burglary that some people have I always gave
something for the money I took even if it was only some little trifle
for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again

And then Alfred E Ricks grovels at Bills feet again and bids us
adieu He says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the
station below and take the train for Denver It salubrified the
atmosphere when that lamentable bollworm took his departure He was a
disgrace to every nonindustrial profession in the country With all
his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an
honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous
burglar I was glad to see him go though I felt a little sorry for
him now that he was ruined forever What could such a man do without
a big capital to work with Why Alfred E Ricks as we left him was
as helpless as turtle on its back He couldnt have worked a scheme to
beat a little girl out of a penny slatepencil

When me and Bill Bassett was left alone I did a little
sleightofmind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of
it Thinks I Ill show this Mr Burglar Man the difference between
business and labor He had hurt some of my professional selfadulation
by casting his Persians upon commerce and trade

I wont take any of your money as a gift Mr Bassett says I to
him but if youll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we
get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in
this towns finances tonight Ill be obliged

Bill Bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we
could catch a safe train

When we got to a town in Arizona called Los Perros I suggested
that we once more try our luck on terracotta That was the home of
Montague Silver my old instructor now retired from business I knew
Monty would stake me to web money if I could show him a fly buzzing
round the locality Bill Bassett said all towns looked alike to
him as he worked mainly in the dark So we got off the train in Los
Perros a fine little town in the silver region

I had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial
slungshot that I intended to hit Bassett behind the ear with I wasnt
going to take his money while he was asleep but I was going to leave
him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him
4755I think that was the amount he had when we got off the train
But the first time I hinted to him about an investment he turns on me
and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions

Brother Peters says he it aint a bad idea to go into an
enterprise of some kind as you suggest I think I will But if I do
it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but Robert E Peary and
Charlie Fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors

I thought you might want to turn your money over says I

I do says he frequently I cant sleep on one side all night
Ill tell you Brother Peters says he Im going to start a poker
room I dont seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as
peddling eggbeaters and working off breakfast food on Barnum and
Bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings But the gambling
business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good
compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a
WaldorfAstoria charity bazar

Then says I Mr Bassett you dont care to talk over my little
business proposition

Why says he do you know you cant get a Pasteur institute to
start up within fifty miles of where I live I bite so seldom

So Bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some
furniture and chromos The same night I went to Monty Silvers house
and he let me have 200 on my prospects Then I went to the only store
in Los Perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the
house The next morning when the store opened I was there bringing all
the cards back with me I said that my partner that was going to back
me in the game had changed his mind and I wanted to sell the cards
back again The storekeeper took em at half price

Yes I was seventyfive dollars loser up to that time But while I
had the cards that night I marked every one in every deck That was
labor And then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread
I had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage
pudding with wine sauce

Of course I was among the first to buy chips at Bill Bassetts game
He had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and I knew
the back of every one of them better than I know the back of my head
when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors

When the game closed I had the five thousand and a few odd dollars
and all Bill Bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had
bought for a mascot Bill shook hands with me when I left

Brother Peters says he I have no business being in business I
was preordained to labor When a No 1 burglar tries to make a James
out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity You have a welloiled
and efficacious system of luck at cards says he Peace go with
you And I never afterward sees Bill Bassett again



Well Jeff said I when the Autolycan adventurer seemed to have
divulged the gist of his tale I hope you took care of the money
That would be a respectathat is a considerable working capital if
you should choose some day to settle down to some sort of regular
business

Me said Jeff virtuously You can bet Ive taken care of that five
thousand

He tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly

Gold mining stock he explained every cent of it Shares par value
one dollar Bound to go up 500 per cent within a year Nonassessable
The Blue Gopher mine Just discovered a month ago Better get in
yourself if youve any spare dollars on hand

Sometimes said I these mines are not

Oh this ones solid as an old goose said Jeff Fifty thousand
dollars worth of ore in sight and 10 per cent monthly earnings
guaranteed

He drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table

Always carry it with me said he So the burglar cant corrupt or
the capitalist break in and water it

I looked at the beautifully engraved certificate of stock

In Colorado I see said I And by the way Jeff what was the
name of the little man who went to Denverthe one you and Bill met at
the station

Alfred E Ricks said Jeff was the toads designation

I see said I the president of this mining company signs himself
A L Fredericks I was wondering

Let me see that stock said Jeff quickly almost snatching it from
me

To mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment I summoned the
waiter and ordered another bottle of the Barbera I thought it was the
least I could do




A TEMPERED WIND


The first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of
Buckingham Skinner was in Kansas City I was standing on a corner when
I see Buck stick his strawcolored head out of a thirdstory window of
a business block and holler Whoa there Whoa like you would in
endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules

I looked around but all the animals I see in sight is a policeman
having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to
posts Then in a minute downstairs tumbles this Buckingham Skinner
and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at
the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious
team of chimerical quadrupeds And then B Skinner goes back up to the
thirdstory room again and I see that the lettering on the window is
The Farmers Friend Loan Company

By and by Strawtop comes down again and I crossed the street to meet
him for I had my ideas Yes sir when I got close I could see where
he overdone it He was Reub all right as far as his blue jeans and
cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actors hands and the rye
straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man
of the Old Homestead Co Curiosity to know what his graft was got the
best of me

Was that your team broke away and run just now I asks him polite
I tried to stop em says I but I couldnt I guess theyre half
way back to the farm by now

Gosh blame them darned mules says Strawtop in a voice so good
that I nearly apologized theyre alus bustin loose And then he
looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in
a different voice Id like to shake hands with Parleyvoo Pickens
the greatest street man in the West barring only Montague Silver
which you can no more than allow

I let him shake hands with me

I learned under Silver I said I dont begrudge him the lead
But whats your graft son I admit that the phantom flight of the
nonexisting animals at which you remarked Whoa has puzzled me
somewhat How do you win out on the trick

Buckingham Skinner blushed

Pocket money says he thats all I am temporarily unfinanced
This little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of
this size How do I work it Why I involve myself as you perceive
in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub Thus embalmed I am Jonas
Stubblefielda name impossible to improve upon I repair noisily
to the office of some loan company conveniently located in the
thirdfloor front There I lay my hat and yarn gloves on the floor
and ask to mortgage my farm for 2000 to pay for my sisters musical
education in Europe Loans like that always suit the loan companies
Its ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be
leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths

Well sir I reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but I
suddenly hear my team running away I run to the window and emit the
wordor exclamation whichever it may beviz Whoa Then I rush
downstairs and down the street returning in a few minutes Dang
them mules I says they done run away and busted the doubletree and
two traces Now I got to hoof it home for I never brought no money
along Reckon well talk about that loan some other time genlemen

Then I spreads out my tarpaulin like the Israelites and waits for
the manna to drop

Why no Mr Stubblefield says the lobstercolored party in the
specs and dotted pique vest oblige us by accepting this tendollar
bill until tomorrow Get your harness repaired and call in at ten
Well be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan

Its a slight thing says Buckingham Skinner modest but as I
said only for temporary loose change

Its nothing to be ashamed of says I in respect for his
mortification in case of an emergency Of course its small
compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the Chicago
University had to be started in a small way

Whats your graft these days Buckingham Skinner asks me

The legitimate says I Im handling rhinestones and Dr Oleum
Sinapis Electric Headache Battery and the Swiss Warblers Bird Call
a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the Bonanza Budget
consisting of a rolledgold wedding and engagement ring six Egyptian
lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nailclipper and fifty
engraved visiting cardsno two names alikeall for the sum of 38
cents

Two months ago says Buckingham Skinner I was doing well down in
Texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed
wood ashes and benzine I sold loads of em in towns where they like
to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light And
just when I was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me
out of business Your machines too slow now pardner they tells
me We can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before
your old flintandtinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess
religion And so I gives up the kindler and drifts up here to KC
This little curtainraiser you seen me doing Mr Pickens with the
simulated farm and the hypothetical teams aint in my line at all
and Im ashamed you found me working it

No man says I kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk
on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he
is financially abashed Still it wasnt quite the proper thing Its
too much like borrowing money without paying it back

I liked Buckingham Skinner from the start for as good a man as ever
stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke And pretty soon we
gets thick and I let him in on a scheme Id had in mind for some
time and offers to go partners

Anything says Buck that is not actually dishonest will find
me willing and ready Let us perforate into the inwardness of your
proposition I feel degraded when I am forced to wear property straw
in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars
Actually Mr Pickens it makes me feel like the Ophelia of the Great
Occidental AllStar OneNight Consolidated Theatrical Aggregation

This scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities By nature I
am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying
elements of existence I am disposed to be lenient with the arts and
sciences and I find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human
works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and
poetry and the Seasons I never skin a sucker without admiring the
prismatic beauty of his scales I never sell a little auriferous
beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony
there is between gold and green And thats why I liked this scheme
it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money

We had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and
I asked Buck if he knew of one to fill the bill

One says I that is cool and wise and strictly business from her
pompadour to her Oxfords No extoedancers or gumchewers or crayon
portrait canvassers for this

Buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see
Miss Sarah Malloy The minute I see her I am pleased She looked to be
the goods as ordered No sign of the three ps about herno peroxide
patchouli nor peau de soie about twentytwo brown hair pleasant
waysthe kind of a lady for the place

A description of the sandbag if you please she begins

Why maam says I this graft of ours is so nice and refined and
romantic it would make the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet look
like secondstory work

We talked it over and Miss Malloy agreed to come in as a business
partner She said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place
as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into
something respectable

This is the way we worked our scheme First I figured it out by a kind
of a proverb The best grafts in the world are built up on copybook
maxims and psalms and proverbs and Esaus fables They seem to kind of
hit off human nature Our peaceful little swindle was constructed on
the old saying The whole push loves a lover

One evening Buck and Miss Malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to
a farmers door She is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm
always clinging to his arm Any one can see that she is a peach and
of the cling variety They claim they are eloping for to be married
on account of cruel parents They ask where they can find a preacher
Farmer says Bgum there aint any preacher nigher than Reverend
Abels four miles over on Caney Creek Farmeress wipes her hand on
her apron and rubbers through her specs


Illustration She is a peach and of the cling variety


Then lo and look ye Up the road from the other way jogs Parleyvoo
Pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing
his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter
doxology

Bjinks says farmer if thar aint a preacher now

It transpires that I am Rev Abijah Green travelling over to Little
Bethel schoolhouse for to preach next Sunday

The young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing
them with the plow mules and the buckboard So the Reverend Green
after hesitating marries em in the farmers parlor And farmer
grins and has in cider and says Bgum and farmeress sniffles a
bit and pats the bride on the shoulder And Parleyvoo Pickens the
wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and
farmeress sign it as witnesses And the parties of the first second
and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away Oh that was an
idyllic graft True love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on
the red barnsit certainly had all other impostures I know about beat
to a batter


So the Reverend Green after hesitations marries em in the
farmers parlor


I suppose I happened along in time to marry Buck and Miss Malloy at
about twenty farmhouses I hated to think how the romance was going
to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in
banks where wed discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes
of hand theyd signed running from 300 to 500

On the 15th day of May us three divided about 6000 Miss Malloy
nearly cried with joy You dont often see a tenderhearted girl or one
that is bent on doing right


Illustration On the 15th day of May us three divided about 6000


Boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this
stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat mens ball It gives
me a chance to reform I was trying to get out of the real estate
business when you fellows came along But if you hadnt taken me in on
this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga
propagators Im afraid Id have got into something worse I was about
to accept a place in one of these Womens Auxiliary Bazars where
they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a
creampuff for seventyfive cents and calling it a Business Mans Lunch

Now I can go into a square honest business and give all them queer
jobs the shake Im going to Cincinnati and start a palm reading and
clairvoyant joint As Madame Saramaloi the Egyptian Sorceress I
shall give everybody a dollars worth of good honest prognostication
Goodby boys Take my advice and go into some decent fake Get
friendly with the police and newspapers and youll be all right

So then we all shook hands and Miss Malloy left us Me and Buck also
rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didnt care to
be around when them marriage certificates fell due

With about 4000 between us we hit that bumptious little town off the
New Jersey coast they call New York

If there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that
YaptownontheHudson Cosmopolitan they call it You bet Sos a piece
of flypaper You listen close when theyre buzzing and trying to pull
their feet out of the sticky stuff Little old New Yorks good enough
for usthats what they sing

Theres enough Reubs walk down Broadway in one hour to buy up a
weeks output of the factory in Augusta Maine that makes Knaughty
Knovelties and the little Phine Phun oroide gold finger ring that
sticks a needle in your friends hand

Youd think New York people was all wise but no They dont get a
chance to learn Everythings too compressed Even the hayseeds are
baled hayseeds But what else can you expect from a town thats shut
off from the world by the ocean on one side and New Jersey on the
other

Its no place for an honest grafter with a small capital Theres too
big a protective tariff on bunco Even when Giovanni sells a quart
of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an
insectivorous cop And the hotel man charges double for everything in
the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke
is about to marry the heiress

But old BadvillenearConey is the ideal burg for a refined piece of
piracy if you can pay the bunco duty Imported grafts come pretty
high The customhouse officers that look after it carry clubs and
its hard to smuggle in even a bibandtucker swindle to work Brooklyn
with unless you can pay the toll But now me and Buck having
capital descends upon New York to try and trade the metropolitan
backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the Vans did a
hundred or two years ago

At an East Side hotel we gets acquainted with Romulus G Atterbury a
man with the finest head for financial operations I ever saw It was
all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers Seeing that head
behind an office railing and youd deposit a million with it without
a receipt This Atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and
the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound
like a cab drivers kick He said he used to be a member of the Stock
Exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a
ring that forced him to sell his seat

Atterbury got to liking me and Buck and he begun to throw on the
canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to
evacuate He had one scheme for starting a National bank on 45 that
made the Mississippi Bubble look as solid as a glass marble He talked
this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we
told him about the roll we had Atterbury borrowed a quarter from us
and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over
again This time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em
as he did The scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he
talked me and Buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome
of thought It looked all right for a kidgloved graft It seemed to
be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police
and as moneymaking as a mint It was just what me and Buck wanteda
regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with
tonsilitis on the street corners every evening

So in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down
in the Wall Street neighborhood with The Golconda Gold Bond and
Investment Company in gilt letters on the door And you see in his
private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer Mr
Buckingham Skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with
his high silk hat close to his hand Nobody yet ever saw Buck outside
of an instantaneous reach for his hat

And you might perceive the president and general manager Mr R G
Atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office
room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a
pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors


Illustration Busy in the main office room dictating letters
to a shorthand countess


There is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of
varnish and culpability

At another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man
attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating
apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head That man
is no other than Colonel Tecumseh once Parleyvoo Pickens the
vicepresident of the company

No recherche rags for me I says to Atterbury when we was
organizing the stage properties of the robbery Im a plain man
says I and I do not use pajamas French or military hairbrushes
Cast me for the role of the rhinestoneintherough or I dont go on
exhibition If you can use me in my natural though displeasing form
do so

Dress you up says Atterbury I should say not Just as you are
youre worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things
they pin chrysanthemums on Youre to play the part of the solid but
disheveled capitalist from the Far West You despise the conventions
Youve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks Conservative
homely rough shrewd savingthats your pose Its a winner in New
York Keep your feet on the desk and eat apples Whenever anybody
comes in eat an apple Let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer
of your desk Look as economical and rich and rugged as you can

I followed out Atterburys instructions I played the Rocky Mountain
capitalist without ruching or frills The way I deposited apple
peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made
Hetty Green look like a spendthrift I could hear Atterbury saying to
victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating Thats our
vicepresident Colonel Pickens    fortune in Western investments
   delightfully plain manners but    could sign his check for
half a million    simple as a child    wonderful head   
conservative and careful almost to a fault


Illustration Thats our vicepresident Colonel Pickens


Atterbury managed the business Me and Buck never quite understood all
of it though he explained it to us in full It seems the company was
a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in
the profits First we officers bought up a controlling interestwe
had to have thatof the shares at 50 cents a hundredjust what the
printer charged usand the rest went to the public at a dollar each
The company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each
month payable on the last day thereof

When any stockholder had paid in as much as 100 the company issued
him a Gold Bond and he became a bondholder I asked Atterbury one day
what benefits and appurtenances these Gold Bonds was to an investor
more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common
sucker who only owned stock Atterbury picked up one of them Gold
Bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal
tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his
feelings was hurt

My dear Colonel Pickens says he you have no soul for Art Think
of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful
gems of the lithographers skill Think of the joy in the household
where one of these Gold Bonds hangs by a pink cord to the whatnot or
is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor Ah I see
your eye growing moist ColonelI have touched you have I not

You have not says I for Ive been watching you The moisture
you see is apple juice You cant expect one man to act as a human
ciderpress and an art connoisseur too

Atterbury attended to the details of the concern As I understand it
they was simple The investors in stock paid in their money and
well I guess thats all they had to do The company received it and
I dont call to mind anything else Me and Buck knew more about
selling corn salve than we did about Wall Street but even we could
see how the Golconda Gold Bond Investment Company was making money
You take in money and pay back ten per cent of it its plain enough
that you make a clean legitimate profit of 90 per cent less
expenses as long as the fish bite

Atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but Buck winks an
eye at him and says You was to furnish the brains Do you call it
good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too
Think again I hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine
die and by acclamation I chip in that much brain work free Me and
Pickens we furnished the capital and well handle the unearned
increment as it incremates

It costs us 500 for office rent and first payment on furniture
1500 more went for printing and advertising Atterbury knew his
business Three months to a minute well last says he A day
longer than that and well have to either go under or go under an
alias By that time we ought to clean up 60000 And then a money
belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the
furniture men can pick the bones

Our ads done the work Country weeklies and Washington handpress
dailies of course says I when we was ready to make contracts

Man says Atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a
Limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer
The game were after is right here in New York and Brooklyn and the
Harlem readingrooms Theyre the people that the streetcar fenders
and the Answers to Correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices
are made for We want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of
column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing
health exercises

Pretty soon the money begins to roll in Buck didnt have to pretend
to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks
and greenbacks People began to drop in the office and buy stock every
day

Most of the shares went in small amounts10 and 25 and 50 and
a good many 2 and 3 lots And the bald and inviolate cranium of
President Atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while Colonel
Tecumseh Pickens the rude but reputable Croesus of the West consumes
so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany
garbage chest that he calls his desk

Just as Atterbury said we ran along about three months without being
troubled Buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the
money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away Buck never thought
much of banks for such purposes We paid the interest regular on the
stock wed sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about We
had nearly 50000 on hand and all three of us had been living as high
as prize fighters out of training

One morning as me and Buck sauntered into the office fat and
flippant from our noon grub we met an easylooking fellow with a
bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out We found Atterbury
looking like hed been caught a mile from home in a wet shower

Know that man he asked us

We said we didnt

I dont either says Atterbury wiping off his head but Ill bet
enough Gold Bonds to paper a cell in the Tombs that hes a newspaper
reporter

What did he want asks Buck

Information says our president Said he was thinking of buying
some stock He asked me about nine hundred questions and every one
of em hit some sore place in the business I know hes on a paper
You cant fool me You see a man about half shabby with an eye like
a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and
knowing more than J P Morgan and Shakespeare put togetherif that
aint a reporter I never saw one I was afraid of this I dont mind
detectives and postoffice inspectorsI talk to em eight minutes and
then sell em stockbut them reporters take the starch out of my
collar Boys I recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away
The signs point that way

Me and Buck talked to Atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand
still That fellow didnt look like a reporter to us Reporters always
pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story youve
heard and strikes you for the drinks But Atterbury was shaky and
nervous all day

The next day me and Buck comes down from the hotel about tenthirty
On the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column
on the front page about our little imposition It was a shame the way
that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late
George W Childs He tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a
rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except
a stockholder Yes Atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad
treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vicepresident
of the Golconda Gold Bond and Investment Company to go away real
sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land

Me and Buck hurries down to the office We finds on the stairs and in
the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is
already jammed full inside to the railing Theyve nearly all got
Golconda stock and Gold Bonds in their hands Me and Buck judged
theyd been reading the papers too

We stopped and looked at our stockholders some surprised It wasnt
quite the kind of a gang we supposed had been investing They all
looked like poor people there was plenty of old women and lots of
young girls that youd say worked in factories and mills Some was old
men that looked like war veterans and some was crippled and a good
many was just kidsbootblacks and newsboys and messengers Some was
workingmen in overalls with their sleeves rolled up Not one of the
gang looked like a stockholder in anything unless it was a peanut
stand But they all had Golconda stock and looked as sick as you
please


Illustration But they all had Golconda stock and looked as
sick as you please


I saw a queer kind of a pale look come on Bucks face when he sized up
the crowd He stepped up to a sickly looking woman and says Madam
do you own any of this stock

I put in a hundred dollars says the woman faint like It was all
I had saved in a year One of my children is dying at home now and I
havent a cent in the house I came to see if I could draw out some
The circulars said you could draw it at any time But they say now I
will lose it all

There was a smart kind of kid in the gangI guess he was a newsboy
I got in twentyfi mister he says looking hopeful at Bucks silk
hat and clothes Dey paid me twofifty a mont on it Say a man
tells me dey cant do dat and be on de square Is dat straight Do you
guess I can get out my twentyfi

Some of the old women was crying The factory girls was plumb
distracted Theyd lost all their savings and theyd be docked for the
time they lost coming to see about it

There was one girla pretty onein a red shawl crying in a corner
like her heart would dissolve Buck goes over and asks her about it

It aint so much losing the money mister says she shaking all
over though Ive been two years saving it up but Jakey wont marry
me now Hell take Rosa Steinfeld I know JJJakey Shes got 400
in the savings bank Ai ai ai she sings out


Illustration Jakey wont marry me now Hell take Rosa Steinfeld


Buck looks all around with that same funny look on his face And then
we see leaning against the wall puffing at his pipe with his eye
shining at us this newspaper reporter Buck and me walks over to him

Youre a real interesting writer says Buck How far do you mean to
carry it Anything more up your sleeve

Oh Im just waiting around says the reporter smoking away in
case any news turns up Its up to your stockholders now Some of
them might complain you know Isnt that the patrol wagon now he
says listening to a sound outside No he goes on thats Doc
Whittlefords old cadaver coupe from the Roosevelt I ought to know
that gong Yes I suppose Ive written some interesting stuff at
times

You wait says Buck Im going to throw an item of news in your
way

Buck reaches in his pocket and hands me a key I knew what he meant
before he spoke Confounded old buccaneerI knew what he meant They
dont make them any better than Buck

Pick says he looking at me hard aint this graft a little out of
our line Do we want Jakey to marry Rosa Steinfeld

Youve got my vote says I Ill have it here in ten minutes And
I starts for the safe deposit vaults

I comes back with the money done up in a big bundle and then Buck and
me takes the journalist reporter around to another door and we let
ourselves into one of the office rooms

Now my literary friend says Buck take a chair and keep still
and Ill give you an interview You see before you two grafters from
Graftersville Grafter County Arkansas Me and Pick have sold brass
jewelry hair tonic song books marked cards patent medicines
Connecticut Smyrna rugs furniture polish and albums in every town
from Old Point Comfort to the Golden Gate Weve grafted a dollar
whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it But we never went
after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick in the
corner of the kitchen hearth Theres an old saying you may have heard
fussily decency averniwhich means its an easy slide from the
street fakers dry goods box to a desk in Wall Street Weve took that
slide but we didnt know exactly what was at the bottom of it Now
you ought to be wise but you aint Youve got New York wiseness
which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes
That aint right You ought to look at the lining and seams and the
buttonholes While we are waiting for the patrol wagon you might get
out your little stub pencil and take notes for another funny piece in
the paper

And then Buck turns to me and says I dont care what Atterbury
thinks He only put in brains and if he gets his capital out hes
lucky But what do you say Pick

Me says I You ought to know me Buck I didnt know who was
buying the stock

All right says Buck And then he goes through the inside door into
the main office and looks at the gang trying to squeeze through the
railing Atterbury and his hat was gone And Buck makes em a short
speech

All you lambs get in line Youre going to get your wool back Dont
shove so Get in a linea _line_not in a pile Lady will you
please stop bleating Your moneys waiting for you Here sonny
dont climb over that railing your dimes are safe Dont cry sis
you aint out a cent Get in _line_ I say Here Pick come and
straighten em out and let em through and out by the other door

Buck takes off his coat pushes his silk hat on the back of his head
and lights up a reina victoria He sets at the table with the boodle
before him all done up in neat packages I gets the stockholders
strung out and marches em single file through from the main room
and the reporter man passes em out of the side door into the hall
again As they go by Buck takes up the stock and the Gold Bonds
paying em cash dollar for dollar the same as they paid in The
shareholders of the Golconda Gold Bond and Investment Company cant
hardly believe it They almost grabs the money out of Bucks hands
Some of the women keep on crying for its a custom of the sex to cry
when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears
whenever they find themselves without either


Illustration The shareholders of the Golconda Gold Bond and
Investment Company cant hardly believe it


The old womens fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom
of their rusty dresses The factory girls just stoop over and flap
their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the
currency goes down in the ladies department of the Old Domestic
LisleThread Bank

Some of the stockholders that had been doing the Jeremiah act the
loudest outside had spasms of restored confidence and wanted to leave
the money invested Salt away that chicken feed in your duds and
skip along says Buck What business have you got investing in
bonds The teapot or the crack in the wall behind the clock for your
hoard of pennies

When the pretty girl in the red shawl cashes in Buck hands her an
extra twenty

A wedding present says our treasurer from the Golconda Company
And sayif Jakey ever follows his nose even at a respectful
distance around the corner where Rosa Steinfeld lives you are hereby
authorized to knock a couple of inches of it off

When they was all paid off and gone Buck calls the newspaper reporter
and shoves the rest of the money over to him

You begun this says Buck now finish it Over there are the books
showing every share and bond issued Heres the money to cover except
what weve spent to live on Youll have to act as receiver I guess
youll do the square thing on account of your paper This is the best
way we know how to settle it Me and our substantial but appleweary
vicepresident are going to follow the example of our revered
president and skip Now have you got enough news for today or do
you want to interview us on etiquette and the best way to make over an
old taffeta skirt

News says the newspaper man taking his pipe out do you think I
could use this I dont want to lose my job Suppose I go around to
the office and tell em this happened Whatll the managing editor
say Hell just hand me a pass to Bellevue and tell me to come back
when I get cured I might turn in a story about a sea serpent wiggling
up Broadway but I havent got the nerve to try em with a pipe like
this A getrichquick schemeexcuse megang giving back the boodle
Oh no Im not on the comic supplement

You cant understand it of course says Buck with his hand on the
door knob Me and Pick aint Wall Streeters like you know em We
never allowed to swindle sick old women and working girls and take
nickels off of kids In the lines of graft weve worked we took money
from the people the Lord made to be buncoedsports and rounders and
smart Alecks and street crowds that always have a few dollars to
throw away and farmers that wouldnt ever be happy if the grafters
didnt come around and play with em when they sold their crops We
never cared to fish for the kind of suckers that bite here No sir
We got too much respect for the profession and for ourselves Goodby
to you Mr Receiver

Here says the journalist reporter wait a minute Theres a broker
I know on the next floor Wait till I put this truck in his safe I
want you fellows to take a drink on me before you go

On you says Buck winking solemn Dont you go and try to make em
believe at the office you said that Thanks We cant spare the time
I reckon So long

And me and Buck slides out the door and thats the way the Golconda
Company went into involuntary liquefaction

If you had seen me and Buck the next night youd have had to go to a
little bum hotel over near the West Side ferry landings We was in a
little back room and I was filling up a gross of sixounce bottles
with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with
cinnamon Buck was smoking contented and he wore a decent brown
derby in place of his silk hat

Its a good thing Pick says he as he drove in the corks that we
got Brady to lend us his horse and wagon for a week Well rustle up
the stake by then This hair tonicll sell right along over in Jersey
Bald heads aint popular over there on account of the mosquitoes

Directly I dragged out my valise and went down in it for labels

Hair tonic labels are out says I Only about a dozen on hand

Buy some more says Buck

We investigated our pockets and found we had just enough money to
settle our hotel bill in the morning and pay our passage over the
ferry

Plenty of the ShaketheShakes Chill Cure labels says I after
looking

What more do you want says Buck Slap em on The chill season is
just opening up in the Hackensack low grounds Whats hair anyway if
you have to shake it off

We pasted on the Chill Cure labels about half an hour and Buck says

Making an honest livins better than that Wall Street anyhow aint
it Pick

You bet says I




HOSTAGES TO MOMUS


I

I never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once But one
time as I say I reversed the decision of the revised statutes and
undertook a thing that Id have to apologize for even under the New
Jersey trust laws

Me and Caligula Polk of Muskogee in the Creek Nation was down in the
Mexican State of Tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte
game Now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in Mexico
just like selling fortyeight cents worth of postagestamps for
fortynine cents is over here So Uncle Porfirio he instructs the
_rurales_ to attend to our case

_Rurales_ Theyre a sort of country police but dont draw any mental
crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray
goatee The _rurales_well if wed mount our Supreme Court on
broncos arm em with Winchesters and start em out after John Doe
_et al_ wed have about the same thing

When the _rurales_ started for us we started for the States They
chased us as far as Matamoras We hid in a brickyard and that night we
swum the Rio Grande Caligula with a brick in each hand absentminded
which he drops upon the soil of Texas forgetting he had em

From there we emigrated to San Antone and then over to New Orleans
where we took a rest And in that town of cotton bales and other
adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented
by the Creoles during the period of Louey Cans in which they are
still served at the side doors The most I can remember of this town
is that me and Caligula and a Frenchman named McCartywait a minute
Adolph McCartywas trying to make the French Quarter pay up the back
tradingstamps due on the Louisiana Purchase when somebody hollers
that the johndarms are coming I have an insufficient recollection of
buying two yellow tickets through a window and I seemed to see a man
swing a lantern and say All aboard I remembered no more except
that the train butcher was covering me and Caligula up with Augusta J
Evanss works and figs

When we become revised we find that we have collided up against the
State of Georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables
except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other
Thursday on signal by tearing up a rail We was waked up in a yellow
pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds Yes sir
for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the
weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window Me
and Caligula dressed and went downstairs The landlord was shelling
peas on the front porch He was six feet of chills and fever and
Hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in
the exercise of his sentiments and features

Caligula who is a spokesman by birth and a small man though
redhaired and impatient of painfulness of any kind speaks up

Pardner says he goodmorning and be darned to you Would you
mind telling us why we are at We know the reason we are where but
cant exactly figure out on account of at what place

Well gentlemen says the landlord I reckoned youall would be
inquiring this morning Youall dropped off of the ninethirty train
here last night and you was right tight Yes you was right smart
in liquor I can inform you that you are now in the town of Mountain
Valley in the State of Georgia

On top of that says Caligula dont say that we cant have
anything to eat

Sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes Ill
call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town

That breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a
yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and
flexible sandstone The landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets
out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so
me and Caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that
enabled every Johnny Reb to lick one and twothirds Yankees for nearly
four years at a stretch

The wonder to me is says Caligula that Uncle Robert Lees boys
didnt chase the Grant and Sherman outfit clear up into Hudsons Bay
It would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany

Hog and hominy I explains is the staple food of this section

Then says Caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs I
thought this was a hotel and not a stable Now if we was in Muskogee
at the St Lucifer House Id show you some breakfast grub Antelope
steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with _chili
con carne_ and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed
pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of
beer You wont find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any
of your Eastern restauraws

Too lavish says I Ive traveled and Im unprejudiced Therell
never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long
enough to stretch down to New Orleans for his coffee and over to
Norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to Vermont and digs a slice of
butter out of a springhouse and then turns over a beehive close to a
white clover patch out in Indiana for the rest Then hed come pretty
close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on Mount
Olympia

Too ephemeral says Caligula Id want ham and eggs or rabbit
stew anyhow for a chaser What do you consider the most edifying and
casual in the way of a dinner

Ive been infatuated from time to time I answers with fancy
ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds
jambolaya and canvascovered ducks but after all theres nothing
less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on
a balcony in sound of the Broadway streetcars with a handorgan
playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest
suicide For the wine give me a reasonable Ponty Cany And thats
all except a _demitasse_

Well says Caligula I reckon in New York you get to be a
conniseer and when you go around with the _demitasse_ you are
naturally bound to buy em stylish grub

Its a great town for epicures says I Youd soon fall into their
ways if you was there

Ive heard it was says Caligula But I reckon I wouldnt I can
polish my fingernails all they need myself



II

After breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the
landlords _flor de upas_ perfectos and took a look at Georgia

The installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor As
far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and
scattered over with patches of piny woods Blackberry bushes was all
that kept the rail fences from falling down About fifteen miles over
to the north was a little range of welltimbered mountains

That town of Mountain Valley wasnt going About a dozen people
permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rainbarrels
and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made
by burning the scenery of Uncle Tom shows

And just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high
man in a long black coat and a beaver hat All the people in sight
bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came
out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows
and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him Our
landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a
carpenters rule and sung out Goodmorning Colonel when he was a
dozen yards gone by

And is that Alexander pa says Caligula to the landlord and why
is he called great

That gentlemen says the landlord is no less than Colonel Jackson
T Rockingham the president of the Sunrise  Edenville Tap Railroad
mayor of Mountain Valley and chairman of the Perry County board of
immigration and public improvements

Been away a good many years hasnt he I asked

No sir Colonel Rockingham is going down to the postoffice for his
mail His fellowcitizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every
morning The colonel is our most prominent citizen Besides the
height of the stock of the Sunrise  Edenville Tap Railroad he owns
a thousand acres of that land across the creek Mountain Valley
delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit

For an hour that afternoon Caligula sat on the back of his neck on the
porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised
print When he was through he took me to the end of the porch among
the sunlight and drying dishtowels I knew that Caligula had invented
a new graft For he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left
catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way

What is it now I asks Just so it aint floating mining stocks or
raising Pennsylvania pinks well talk it over

Pennsylvania pinks Oh that refers to a coinraising scheme of the
Keystoners They burn the soles of old womens feet to make them tell
where their moneys hid

Caligulas words in business was always few and bitter

You see them mountains said he pointing And you seen that
colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the
postoffice than Roosevelt does when he cleans em out What were
going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a
ransom of ten thousand dollars

Illegality says I shaking my head

I knew youd say that says Caligula At first sight it does seem
to jar peace and dignity But it dont I got the idea out of that
newspaper Would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the
United States itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified

Kidnapping says I is an immoral function in the derogatory list
of the statutes If the United States upholds it it must be a recent
enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery

Listen says Caligula and Ill explain the case set down in the
papers Here was a Greek citizen named Burdick Harris says he
captured for a graft by Africans and the United States sends two
gunboats to the State of Tangiers and makes the King of Morocco give
up seventy thousand dollars to Raisuli

Go slow says I That sounds too international to take in all at
once Its like thimble thimble whos got the naturalization
papers

Twas press despatches from Constantinople says Caligula Youll
see six months from now Theyll be confirmed by the monthly magazines
and then it wont be long till youll notice em alongside the photos
of the Mount Pelee eruption photos in the whileyougetyourhaircut
weeklies Its all right Pick This African man Raisuli hides Burdick
Harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments
of different nations Now you wouldnt think for a minute goes on
Caligula that John Hay would have chipped in and helped this graft
along if it wasnt a square game would you

Why no says I Ive always stood right in with Bryans policies
and I couldnt consciously say a word against the Republican
administration just now But if Harris was a Greek on what system of
international protocols did Hay interfere

It aint exactly set forth in the papers says Caligula I suppose
its a matter of sentiment You know he wrote this poem Little
Breeches and them Greeks wear little or none But anyhow John Hay
sends the Brooklyn and the Olympia over and they cover Africa with
thirtyinch guns And then Hay cables after the health of the _persona
grata_ And how are they this morning he wires Is Burdick Harris
alive yet or Mr Raisuli dead And the King of Morocco sends up the
seventy thousand dollars and they turn Burdick Harris loose And
theres not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little
kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress And Burdick
Harris says to the reporters in the Greek language that hes often
heard about the United States and he admires Roosevelt next to
Raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers
that he ever worked alongside of So you see Pick winds up
Caligula weve got the law of nations on our side Well cut this
colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains
and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars

Well you seldom little redheaded territorial terror I answers
you cant bluff your uncle Tecumseh Pickens Ill be your company in
this graft But I misdoubt if youve absorbed the inwardness of this
Burdick Harris case Calig and if on any morning we get a telegram
from the Secretary of State asking about the health of the scheme
I propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in
this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and
peaceful nation of Alabama



III

Me and Caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch
of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap Colonel Jackson T
Rockingham We finally selected an upright slice of topography covered
with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that
we cut out up the side of it And the only way to reach the mountain
was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations

Then I took in hand an important subdivision of the
proceedings I went up to Atlanta on the train and laid in a
twohundredandfiftydollar supply of the most gratifying and
efficient lines of grub that money could buy I always was an admirer
of viands in their more palliative and revised stages Hog and hominy
are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to
my moral sentiments And I thought of Colonel Jackson T Rockingham
president of the Sunrise  Edenville Tap Railroad and how he would
miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy
Southerners So I sunk half of mine and Caligulas capital in as
elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as Burdick Harris or
any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp

I put another hundred in a couple of cases of Bordeaux two quarts
of cognac two hundred Havana regalias with gold bands and a camp
stove and stools and folding cots I wanted Colonel Rockingham to be
comfortable and I hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars
he would give me and Caligula as good a name for gentlemen and
entertainers as the Greek man did the friend of his that made the
United States his bill collector against Africa

When the goods came down from Atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up
on the little mountain and established camp And then we laid for the
colonel

We caught him one morning about two miles out from Mountain Valley
on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land He was an
elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled
shirtcuffs and specs on a black string We explained to him brief
and easy what we wanted and Caligula showed him careless the
handle of his fortyfive under his coat

What says Colonel Rockingham Bandits in Perry County Georgia I
shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears
of this

Be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says Caligula by
order of the board of perforation and public depravity This is a
business meeting and were anxious to adjourn _sine qua non_

We drove Colonel Rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it
as far as the buggy could go Then we tied the horse and took our
prisoner on foot up to the camp

Now colonel I says to him were after the ransom me and my
partner and no harm will come to you if the King of Morif your
friends send up the dust In the mean time we are gentlemen the same
as you And if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom
of the camp is yours

I give you my word says the colonel

All right says I and now its eleven oclock and me and Mr Polk
will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few welltimed
trivialities in the way of grub

Thank you says the colonel I believe I could relish a slice of
bacon and a plate of hominy

But you wont says I emphatic Not in this camp We soar in higher
regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish

While the colonel read his paper me and Caligula took off our coats
and went in for a little luncheon _de luxe_ just to show him Caligula
was a fine cook of the Western brand He could toast a buffalo or
fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of
tea He was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste
and muscle and quantity was to be considered He held the record west
of the Arkansas River for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling
venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth
at the same time But I could do things _en casserole_ and _a la
creole_ and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a
French _chef_

So at twelve oclock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a
banquet on a Mississippi River steamboat We spread it on the tops of
two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the
olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a readymade Martini by the
colonels plate and called him to grub

Colonel Rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and
looked at the things on the table Then I thought he was swearing and
I felt mean because I hadnt taken more pains with the victuals But
he wasnt he was asking a blessing and me and Caligula hung our
heads and I saw a tear drop from the colonels eye into his cocktail

I never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and applicationnot
hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and
appreciative like a anaconda or a real _vive bonjour_

In an hour and a half the colonel leaned back I brought him a pony of
brandy and his black coffee and set the box of Havana regalias on the
table

Gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe
it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and
beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the Creator
who

Excuse me colonel says I but theres some business to attend to
now and I brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him
Who do you want to send to for the money I asks

I reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vicepresident of
our railroad at the general offices of the Company in Edenville

How far is it to Edenville from here I asked

About ten miles says he

Then I dictated these lines and Colonel Rockingham wrote them out


 I am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws
 in a place which is useless to attempt to find They demand
 ten thousand dollars at once for my release The amount must
 be raised immediately and these directions followed Come
 alone with the money to Stony Creek which runs out of
 Blacktop Mountains Follow the bed of the creek till you
 come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked
 a cross in red chalk Stand on the rock and wave a white
 flag A guide will come to you and conduct you to where I am
 held Lose no time


After the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a
postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldnt
feel uneasy in its bosom about him We agreed to that He wrote down
that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then
he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee He wound
up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would
probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch

Me and Caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being
cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a
sight draft for ten thousand dollars

I took the letter over to the Mountain Valley road and watched for a
messenger By and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback
riding toward Edenville I gave him a dollar to take the letter to the
railroad offices and then I went back to camp



IV

About four oclock in the afternoon Caligula who was acting as
lookout calls to me

I have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir

I went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca
coat and no collar

Gentlemen says Colonel Rockingham allow me to introduce my
brother Captain Duval C Rockingham vicepresident of the Sunrise 
Edenville Tap Railroad

Otherwise the King of Morocco says I I reckon you dont mind my
counting the ransom just as a business formality

Well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes I
turned that matter over to our second vicepresident I was anxious
after Brother Jacksons safetiness I reckon hell be along right
soon What does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like Brother
Jackson

Mr VicePresident says I youll oblige us by remaining here till
the second V P arrives This is a private rehearsal and we dont
want any roadside speculators selling tickets

In half an hour Caligula sings out again

Sail ho Looks like an apron on a broomstick

I perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot
three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could
notice Thinks I to myself if hes got ten thousand dollars on his
person its in one bill and folded lengthwise

Mr Patterson G Coble our second vicepresident announces the
colonel

Glad to know you gentlemen says this Coble I came up to
disseminate the tidings that Major Tallahassee Tucker our general
passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad
bonds with the Perry County Bank for a loan My dear Colonel
Rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of
fare in your note Me and the conductor of fiftysix was having a
dispute about it

Another white wings on the rocks hollers Caligula If I see any
more Ill fire on em and swear they was torpedoboats

The guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue
overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern I am so sure
that this is Major Tucker that I dont even ask him until we are
up above and then I discover that it is Uncle Timothy the yard
switchman at Edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings
with the gossip that Judge Pendergast the railroads attorney is in
the process of mortgaging Colonel Rockinghams farming lands to make
up the ransom

While he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp
and Caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty
draws his gun But again Colonel Rockingham intervenes and introduces
Mr Jones and Mr Batts engineer and fireman of train number
fortytwo

Excuse us says Batts but me and Jim have hunted squirrels
all over this mounting and we dont need no white flag Was that
straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real
store cigars

Towel on a fishingpole in the offing howls Caligula Suppose its
the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman

My last trip down says I wiping off my face If the S  E T
wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their
president let em Well put out our sign The Kidnappers Cafe and
Trainmens Home

This time I caught Major Tallahassee Tucker by his own confession and
I felt easier I asked him into the creek so I could drown him if he
happened to be a trackwalker or caboose porter All the way up the
mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his
intelligence in life had skipped

Up above I got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had
raised the ransom

My dear sir says he I succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty
thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and

Never mind just now major says I Its all right then Wait till
after dinner and well settle the business All of you gentlemen
I continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner We have
mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave
over the proceedings

The correct idea says Caligula who was standing by me Two
baggagemasters and a ticketagent dropped out of a tree while you was
below the last time Did the major man bring the money

He says I answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan

If any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me
and Caligula did that day At six oclock we spread the top of the
mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever
engulfed We opened all the wine and we concocted entrees and _pieces
de resistance_ and stirred up little savory _chef de cuisines_ and
organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of
canned and bottled goods The railroad gathered around it and the
wassail and diversions was intense

After the feast me and Caligula in the line of business takes
Major Tucker to one side and talks ransom The major pulls out an
agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in
the suburbs of Rabbitville Arizona and makes this outcry

Gentlemen says he the stock of the Sunrise  Edenville railroad
has depreciated some The best I could do with thirty thousand
dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eightyseven
dollars and fifty cents On the farming lands of Colonel Rockingham
Judge Pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of
fifty dollars You will find the amount one hundred and thirtyseven
fifty correct

A railroad president said I looking this Tucker in the eye and
the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet

Gentlemen says Tucker The railroad is ten miles long There dont
any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and
gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam A long time ago when
times was good the net earnings used to run as high as eighteen
dollars a week Colonel Rockinghams land has been sold for taxes
thirteen times There hasnt been a peach crop in this part of Georgia
for two years The wet spring killed the watermelons Nobody around
here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn
crop failed and there wasnt enough grass to support the rabbits All
the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and
hominy and

Pick interrupts Caligula mussing up his red hair what are you
going to do with that chickenfeed

I hands the money back to Major Tucker and then I goes over to
Colonel Rockingham and slaps him on the back

Colonel says I I hope youve enjoyed our little joke We dont
want to carry it too far Kidnappers Well wouldnt it tickle your
uncle My names Rhinegelder and Im a nephew of Chauncey Depew My
friends a second cousin of the editor of _Puck_ So you can see We
are down South enjoying ourselves in our humorous way Now theres
two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the jokes over

Whats the use to go into details One or two will be enough I remember
Major Tallahassee Tucker playing on a jewsharp and Caligula waltzing
with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggagemaster I hesitate
to refer to the cakewalk done by me and Mr Patterson G Coble with
Colonel Jackson T Rockingham between us

And even on the next morning when you wouldnt think it possible
there was a consolation for me and Caligula We knew that Raisuli
himself never made half the hit with Burdick Harris that we did with
the Sunrise  Edenville Tap Railroad




THE ETHICS OF PIG


On an eastbound train I went into the smoker and found Jefferson
Peters the only man with a brain west of the Wabash River who can use
his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time

Jeff is in the line of unillegal graft He is not to be dreaded by
widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage His favorite
disguise is that of the targetbird at which the spendthrift or the
reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars He is readily
vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easyburning
brevas I got the story of his latest Autolycan adventure

In my line of business said Jeff the hardest thing is to find an
upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with
Some of the best men I ever worked with in a swindle would resort to
trickery at times

So last summer I thinks I will go over into this section of country
where I hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if I can find a
partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet
contaminated by success

I found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout The
inhabitants hadnt found that Adam had been dispossessed and were
going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if
they were in the Garden of Eden They call this town Mount Nebo and
its up near the spot where Kentucky and West Virginia and North
Carolina corner together Them States dont meet Well it was in that
neighborhood anyway

After putting in a week proving I wasnt a revenue officer I went
over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to
see if I could get a line on the kind of man I wanted

Gentlemen says I after we had rubbed noses and gathered round
the driedapple barrel I dont suppose theres another community
in the whole world into which sin and chicanery has less extensively
permeated than this Life here where all the women are brave and
propitious and all the men honest and expedient must indeed be
an idol It reminds me says I of Goldsteins beautiful ballad
entitled The Deserted Village which says


 Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey
 What art can drive its charms away
 The judge rode slowly down the lane mother
 For Im to be Queen of the May


Why yes Mr Peters says the storekeeper I reckon we air about
as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according
to censuses of opinion but I reckon you aint ever met Rufe Tatum

Why no says the town constable he cant hardly have ever That
air Rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin
on the galluses And that puts me in mind that I ought to have turned
Rufe out of the lockup before yesterday The thirty days he got for
killin Yance Goodloe was up then A day or two more wont hurt Rufe
any though

Shucks now says I in the mountain idiom dont tell me theres
a man in Mount Nebo as bad as that

Worse says the storekeeper He steals hogs

I think I will look up this Mr Tatum so a day or two after the
constable turned him out I got acquainted with him and invited him out
on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business

What I wanted was a partner with a natural rural makeup to play a
part in some little oneact outrages that I was going to book with the
Pitfall  Gin circuit in some of the Western towns and this R Tatum
was born for the role as sure as nature cast Fairbanks for the stuff
that kept _Eliza_ from sinking into the river

He was about the size of a first baseman and he had ambiguous blue
eyes like the china dog on the mantelpiece that Aunt Harriet used to
play with when she was a child His hair waved a little bit like the
statue of the dinkusthrower at the Vacation in Rome but the color
of it reminded you of the Sunset in the Grand Canon by an American
Artist that they hang over the stovepipe holes in the salongs
He was the Reub without needing a touch Youd have known him for
one even if youd seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton
suspender and a straw over his ear

I told him what I wanted and found him ready to jump at the job

Overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of
manslaughter says I what have you accomplished in the way of
indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point
to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for
the position

Why says he in his kind of Southern system of procrastinated
accents haint you heard tell There aint any man black or white
in the Blue Ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as I can without
bein heard seen or cotched I can lift a shoat he goes on out
of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or
night anywhere or anyhow and I guarantee nobody wont hear a squeal
Its all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards
Some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pigpens I hope to
become reckernized as the champion shoatstealer of the world

Its proper to be ambitious says I and hogstealing will do very
well for Mount Nebo but in the outside world Mr Tatum it would be
considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on Bay State
Gas However it will do as a guarantee of good faith Well go into
partnership Ive got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that
homewardplods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a
few shares of Soon Parted preferred in the money market

So I attaches Rufe and we go away from Mount Nebo down into the
lowlands And all the way I coach him for his part in the grafts I had
in mind I had idled away two months on the Florida coast and was
feeling all to the Ponce de Leon besides having so many new schemes
up my sleeve that I had to wear kimonos to hold em

I intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide
though the farming belt of the Middle West so we headed in that
direction But when we got as far as Lexington we found Binkley
Brothers circus there and the bluegrass peasantry romping into
town and pounding the Belgian blocks with their handpegged sabots as
artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a Datto Bryan drama I
never pass a circus without pulling the valvecord and coming down for
a little Key West money so I engaged a couple of rooms and board for
Rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady
named Peevy Then I took Rufe to a clothing store and gentsoutfitted
him He showed up strong as I knew he would after he was rigged up
in the readymade rutabaga regalia Me and old Misfitzky stuffed him
into a bright blue suit with a Nile green visible plaid effect and
riveted on a fancy vest of a light Tuskegee Normal tan color a red
necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town

They were the first clothes Rufe had ever worn except the gingham
layette and the butternut topdressing of his native kraal and he
looked as selfconscious as an Igorrote with a new nosering

That night I went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell
game Rufe was to be the capper I gave him a roll of phony currency
to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his
winnings out of No I didnt mistrust him but I simply cant
manipulate the ball to lose when I see real money bet My fingers go
on a strike every time I try it

I set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to
guess which shell the little pea was under The unlettered hinds
gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter
one another to bet Then was when Rufe ought to have singlefooted
up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives
to get them started But no Rufe Id seen him two or three times
walking about and looking at the sideshow pictures with his mouth
full of peanut candy but he never came nigh

The crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a
capper is like fishing without a bait I closed the game with only
fortytwo dollars of the unearned increment while I had been counting
on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least I went home at eleven
and went to bed I supposed that the circus had proved too alluring
for Rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but I
meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the
morning

Just after Morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress
I hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster
screeching with greenapple colic I opens my door and calls out in
the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out I says
Mrs Peevy maam would you mind choking off that kid of yours so
that honest people can get their rest

Sir says she its no child of mine Its the pig squealing that
your friend Mr Tatum brought home to his room a couple of hours ago
And if you are uncle or second cousin or brother to it Id appreciate
your stopping its mouth sir yourself if you please

I put on some of the polite outside habiliments of external society
and went into Rufes room He had gotten up and lit his lamp and
was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingywhite
halfgrown squealing pig

How is this Rufe says I You flimflammed in your part of the
work tonight and put the game on crutches And how do you explain the
pig It looks like backsliding to me

Now dont be too hard on me Jeff says he You know how long
Ive been used to stealing shoats Its got to be a habit with me And
tonight when I see such a fine chance I couldnt help takin it

Well says I maybe youve really got kleptopigia And maybe when
we get out of the pig belt youll turn your mind to higher and more
remunerative misconduct Why you should want to stain your soul with
such a distasteful feebleminded perverted roaring beast as that I
cant understand

Why Jeff says he you aint in sympathy with shoats You dont
understand em like I do This here seems to me to be an animal of
more than common powers of ration and intelligence He walked half
across the room on his hind legs a while ago

Well Im going back to bed says I See if you can impress it
upon your friends ideas of intelligence that hes not to make so much
noise

He was hungry says Rufe Hell go to sleep and keep quiet now

I always get up before breakfast and read the morning paper whenever
I happen to be within the radius of a Hoe cylinder or a Washington
handpress The next morning I got up early and found a Lexington
daily on the front porch where the carrier had thrown it The first
thing I saw in it was a doublecolumn ad on the front page that read
like this


 FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD

 The above amount will be paid and no questions asked
 for the return alive and uninjured of Beppo the famous
 European educated pig that strayed or was stolen from
 the sideshow tents of Binkley Bros circus last night

 Geo B Tapley Business Manager
 At the circus grounds


I folded up the paper flat put it into my inside pocket and went to
Rufes room He was nearly dressed and was feeding the pig the rest
of the milk and some applepeelings

Well well well good morning all I says hearty and amiable So
we are up And piggy is having his breakfast What had you intended
doing with that pig Rufe

Im going to crate him up says Rufe and express him to ma in
Mount Nebo Hell be company for her while I am away

Hes a mighty fine pig says I scratching him on the back

You called him a lot of names last night says Rufe

Oh well says I he looks better to me this morning I was raised
on a farm and Im very fond of pigs I used to go to bed at sundown
so I never saw one by lamplight before Tell you what Ill do Rufe
I says Ill give you ten dollars for that pig

I reckon I wouldnt sell this shoat says he If it was any other
one I might

Why not this one I asked fearful that he might know something

Why because says he it was the grandest achievement of my life
There aint airy other man that could have done it If I ever have a
fireside and children Ill sit beside it and tell em how their daddy
toted off a shoat from a whole circus full of people And maybe my
grandchildren too Theyll certainly be proud a whole passel Why
says he there was two tents one openin into the other This shoat
was on a platform tied with a little chain I seen a giant and a
lady with a fine chance of bushy white hair in the other tent I got
the shoat and crawled out from under the canvas again without him
squeakin as loud as a mouse I put him under my coat and I must have
passed a hundred folks before I got out where the streets was dark I
reckon I wouldnt sell that shoat Jeff Id want ma to keep it so
thered be a witness to what I done

The pig wont live long enough I says to use as an exhibit in
your senile fireside mendacity Your grandchildren will have to take
your word for it Ill give you one hundred dollars for the animal

Rufe looked at me astonished

The shoat cant be worth anything like that to you he says What
do you want him for

Viewing me casuistically says I with a rare smile you wouldnt
think that Ive got an artistic side to my temper But I have Im a
collector of pigs Ive scoured the world for unusual pigs Over in
the Wabash Valley Ive got a hog ranch with most every specimen on it
from a Merino to a Poland China This looks like a blooded pig to me
Rufe says I I believe its a genuine Berkshire Thats why Id
like to have it

Id shore like to accommodate you says he but Ive got the
artistic tenement too I dont see why it aint art when you can
steal a shoat better than anybody else can Shoats is a kind of
inspiration and genius with me Specially this one I wouldnt take
two hundred and fifty for that animal

Now listen says I wiping off my forehead Its not so much a
matter of business with me as it is art and not so much art as it is
philanthropy Being a connoisseur and disseminator of pigs I wouldnt
feel like Id done my duty to the world unless I added that Berkshire
to my collection Not intrinsically but according to the ethics of
pigs as friends and coadjutors of mankind I offer you five hundred
dollars for the animal

Jeff says this pork esthete it aint money its sentiment with
me

Seven hundred says I

Make it eight hundred says Rufe and Ill crush the sentiment out
of my heart

I went under my clothes for my moneybelt and counted him out forty
twentydollar gold certificates

Ill just take him into my own room says I and lock him up till
after breakfast

I took the pig by the hind leg He turned on a squeal like the steam
calliope at the circus

Let me tote him in for you says Rufe and he picks up the beast
under one arm holding his snout with the other hand and packs him
into my room like a sleeping baby

After breakfast Rufe who had a chronic case of haberdashery ever
since I got his trousseau says he believes he will amble down to
Misfitzkys and look over some royalpurple socks And then I got as
busy as a onearmed man with the nettlerash pasting on wallpaper I
found an old Negro man with an express wagon to hire and we tied the
pig in a sack and drove down to the circus grounds

I found George B Tapley in a little tent with a window flap open He
was a fattish man with an immediate eye in a black skullcap with a
fourounce diamond screwed into the bosom of his red sweater

Are you George B Tapley I asks

I swear it says he

Well Ive got it says I

Designate says he Are you the guinea pigs for the Asiatic python
or the alfalfa for the sacred buffalo

Neither says I Ive got Beppo the educated hog in a sack in
that wagon I found him rooting up the flowers in my front yard this
morning Ill take the five thousand dollars in large bills if its
handy

George B hustles out of his tent and asks me to follow We went
into one of the sideshows In there was a jet black pig with a pink
ribbon around his neck lying on some hay and eating carrots that a man
was feeding to him

Hey Mac calls G B Nothing wrong with the worldwide this
morning is there

Him No says the man Hes got an appetite like a chorus girl at
1 AM

Howd you get this pipe says Tapley to me Eating too many pork
chops last night

I pulls out the paper and shows him the ad

Fake says he Dont know anything about it Youve beheld
with your own eyes the marvelous worldwide porcine wonder of the
fourfooted kingdom eating with preternatural sagacity his matutinal
meal unstrayed and unstole Good morning

I was beginning to see I got in the wagon and told Uncle Ned to
drive to the most adjacent orifice of the nearest alley There I took
out my pig got the range carefully for the other opening set his
sights and gave him such a kick that he went out the other end of the
alley twenty feet ahead of his squeal

Then I paid Uncle Ned his fifty cents and walked down to the
newspaper office I wanted to hear it in cold syllables I got the
advertising man to his window

To decide a bet says I wasnt the man who had this ad put in
last night short and fat with long black whiskers and a clubfoot

He was not says the man He would measure about six feet by four
and a half inches with cornsilk hair and dressed like the pansies
of the conservatory

At dinner time I went back to Mrs Peevys

Shall I keep some soup hot for Mr Tatum till he comes back she
asks

If you do maam says I youll more than exhaust for firewood
all the coal in the bosom of the earth and all the forests on the
outside of it

So there you see said Jefferson Peters in conclusion how hard
it is ever to find a fairminded and honest businesspartner

But I began with the freedom of long acquaintance the rule
should work both ways If you had offered to divide the reward you
would not have lost

Jeffs look of dignified reproach stopped me

That dont involve the same principles at all said he Mine was a
legitimate and moral attempt at speculation Buy low and sell high
dont Wall Street endorse it Bulls and bears and pigswhats the
difference Why not bristles as well as horns and fur

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
