CAPTAIN BRASSBOUNDS CONVERSION

By Bernard Shaw




ACT I

On the heights overlooking the harbor of Mogador a seaport on the west
coast of Morocco the missionary in the coolness of the late afternoon
is following the precept of Voltaire by cultivating his garden He is
an elderly Scotchman spiritually a little weatherbeaten as having to
navigate his creed in strange waters crowded with other craft but still
a convinced son of the Free Church and the North African Mission with
a faithful brown eye and a peaceful soul Physically a wiry smallknit
man well tanned clean shaven with delicate resolute features and
a twinkle of mild humor He wears the sun helmet and pagri the
neutraltinted spectacles and the white canvas Spanish sand shoes of
the modern Scotch missionary but instead of a cheap tourists suit from
Glasgow a grey flannel shirt with white collar a green sailor knot tie
with a cheap pin in it he wears a suit of clean white linen acceptable
in color if not in cut to the Moorish mind

The view from the garden includes much Atlantic Ocean and a long stretch
of sandy coast to the south swept by the north east trade wind
and scantily nourishing a few stunted pepper trees mangy palms and
tamarisks The prospect ends as far as the land is concerned in
little hills that come nearly to the sea rudiments these of the Atlas
Mountains The missionary having had daily opportunities of looking at
this seascape for thirty years or so pays no heed to it being absorbed
in trimming a huge red geranium bush to English eyes unnaturally
big which with a dusty smilax or two is the sole product of his pet
flowerbed He is sitting to his work on a Moorish stool In the middle
of the garden there is a pleasant seat in the shade of a tamarisk tree
The house is in the south west corner of the garden and the geranium
bush in the north east corner

At the gardendoor of the house there appears presently a man who is
clearly no barbarian being in fact a less agreeable product peculiar
to modern commercial civilization His frame and flesh are those of an
illnourished lad of seventeen but his age is inscrutable only the
absence of any sign of grey in his mud colored hair suggests that he is
at all events probably under forty without prejudice to the possibility
of his being under twenty A Londoner would recognize him at once as an
extreme but hardy specimen of the abortion produced by nature in a city
slum His utterance affectedly pumped and hearty and naturally vulgar
and nasal is ready and fluent nature a Board School education and
some kerbstone practice having made him a bit of an orator His dialect
apart from its base nasal delivery is not unlike that of smart London
society in its tendency to replace diphthongs by vowels sometimes
rather prettily and to shuffle all the traditional vowel
pronunciations He pronounces ow as ah and i as aw using the ordinary
ow for o i for a a for u and e for a with this reservation that
when any vowel is followed by an r he signifies its presence not by
pronouncing the r which he never does under these circumstances but by
prolonging and modifyinq the vowel sometimes even to the extreme degree
of pronouncing it properly As to his yol for l a compendious delivery
of the provincial ehal and other metropolitan refinements amazing to
all but cockneys they cannot be indicated save in the above imperfect
manner without the aid of a phonetic alphabet He is dressed in
somebody elses very second best as a coastguardsman and gives himself
the airs of a stage tar with sufficient success to pass as a possible
fish porter of bad character in casual employment during busy times
at Billingsgate His manner shows an earnest disposition to ingratiate
himself with the missionary probably for some dishonest purpose

THE MAN Awtenoon Mr Renkin The missionary sits up quickly and
turns resigning himself dutifully to the interruption Yr honors

RANKIN Good afternoon to ye Mr Drinkwotter

As Drinkwater turns to go a Moorish porter comes from the house with
two Krooboys

THE PORTER at the door addressing Rankin Bikouros Moroccan for
Epicurus a general Moorish name for the missionaries who are supposed
by the Moors to have chosen their calling through a love of luxurious
idleness I have brought to your house a Christian dog and his woman

DRINKWATER Theres eathen menners fer yer Calls Sr Ahrd Ellam an Lidy
Winefleet a Christian dorg and is woman If ee ed you in the dorck

RANKIN Have you broat their boxes

THE PORTER By Allah two camel loads

RANKIN Have you been paid

THE PORTER Only one miserable dollar Bikouros I have brought them to
your house They will pay you Give me something for bringing gold to
your door

DRINKWATER Yah You oughter bin bawn a Christian you ought You knaow
too mach

RANKIN You have broat onnly trouble and expense to my door Hassan
and you know it Have I ever charged your wife and children for my
medicines

HASSAN philosophically It is always permitted by the Prophet to ask
Bikouros He goes cheerfully into the house with the Krooboys

DRINKWATER Jist thort eed trah it orn a did Hooman nitre is the sime
everywheres Them eathens is jast lawk you an me gavner

A lady and gentleman both English come into the garden The gentleman
more than elderly is facing old age on compulsion not resignedly He
is clean shaven and has a brainy rectangular forehead a resolute nose
with strongly governed nostrils and a tightly fastened down mouth which
has evidently shut in much temper and anger in its time He has a habit
of deliberately assumed authority and dignity but is trying to take
life more genially and easily in his character of tourist which is
further borne out by his white hat and summery racecourse attire

The lady is between thirty and forty tall very goodlooking
sympathetic intelligent tender and humorous dressed with cunning
simplicity not as a businesslike tailor made gaitered tourist but as
if she lived at the next cottage and had dropped in for tea in blouse
and flowered straw hat A woman of great vitality and humanity who
begins a casual acquaintance at the point usually attained by English
people after thirty years acquaintance when they are capable of reaching
it at all She pounces genially on Drinkwater who is smirking at her
hat in hand with an air of hearty welcome The gentleman on the other
hand comes down the side of the garden next the house instinctively
maintaining a distance between himself and the others

THE LADY to Drinkwater How dye do Are you the missionary

DRINKWATER modestly Naow lidy aw will not deceive you thow the
mistike his but netral Awm wanne of the missionarys good works

Sr Ahrd Ellam He withdraws discreetly into the house

SIR HOWARD to Rankin I am sorry to intrude on you Mr Rankin but in
the absence of a hotel there seems to be no alternative

LADY CICELY beaming on him Besides we would so much RATHER stay with
you if you will have us Mr Rankin

SIR HOWARD introducing her My sisterinlaw Lady Cicely Waynflete
Mr Rankin

RANKIN I am glad to be of service to your leddyship You will be
wishing to have some tea after your journey Im thinking

LADY CICELY Thoughtful man that you are Mr Rankin But weve had
some already on board the yacht And Ive arranged everything with your
servants so you must go on gardening just as if we were not here

SIR HOWARD I am sorry to have to warn you Mr Rankin that Lady
Cicely from travelling in Africa has acquired a habit of walking into
peoples houses and behaving as if she were in her own

LADY CICELY But my dear Howard I assure you the natives like it

RANKIN gallantly So do I

LADY CICELY delighted Oh that is so nice of you Mr Rankin This
is a delicious country And the people seem so good They have such
nice faces We had such a handsome Moor to carry our luggage up And two
perfect pets of Krooboys Did you notice their faces Howard

SIR HOWARD I did and I can confidently say after a long experience of
faces of the worst type looking at me from the dock that I have never
seen so entirely villainous a trio as that Moor and the two Krooboys to
whom you gave five dollars when they would have been perfectly satisfied
with one

RANKIN throwing up his hands Five dollars Tis easy to see you are
not Scotch my leddy

LADY CICELY Oh poor things they must want it more than we do and you
know Howard that Mahometans never spend money in drink

RANKIN Excuse me a moment my leddy I have a word in season to say to
that same Moor He goes into the house

LADY CICELY walking about the garden looking at the view and at the
flowers I think this is a perfectly heavenly place

Drinkwater returns from the house with a chair

DRINKWATER placing the chair for Sir Howard Awskink yr pawdn for the
libbety Sr Ahrd

SIR HOWARD looking a him I have seen you before somewhere

DRINKWATER You ev Sr Ahrd But aw do assure yer it were hall a
mistike

SIR HOWARD As usual He sits down Wrongfully convicted of course

DRINKWATER with sly delight Naow gavner Half whispering with an
ineffable grin Wrorngfully hacquittid

SIR HOWARD Indeed Thats the first case of the kind I have ever met

DRINKWATER Lawd Sr Ahrd wot jagginses them jurymen was You an me
knaowed it too didnt we

SIR HOWARD I daresay we did I am sorry to say I forget the exact
nature of the difficulty you were in Can you refresh my memory

DRINKWATER Owny the aw sperrits o youth y lawdship Worterleoo Rowd
kice Wot they calls Ooliganism

SIR HOWARD Oh You were a Hooligan were you

LADY CICELY puzzled A Hooligan

DRINKWATER deprecatingly Nime giv huz pore thortless leds baw a gent
on the Dily Chrornicle lidy Rankin returns Drinkwater immediately
withdraws stopping the missionary for a moment near the threshold to
say touching his forelock Awll eng abaht within ile gavner hin kice
aw should be wornted He goes into the house with soft steps

Lady Cicely sits down on the bench under the tamarisk Rankin takes his
stool from the flowerbed and sits down on her left Sir Howard being on
her right

LADY CICELY What a pleasant face your sailor friend has Mr Rankin He
has been so frank and truthful with us You know I dont think anybody
can pay me a greater compliment than to be quite sincere with me at
first sight Its the perfection of natural good manners

SIR HOWARD You must not suppose Mr Rankin that my sisterinlaw
talks nonsense on purpose She will continue to believe in your friend
until he steals her watch and even then she will find excuses for him

RANKIN drily changing the subject And how have ye been Sir Howrrd
since our last meeting that morning nigh forty year ago down at the
docks in London

SIR HOWARD greatly surprised pulling himself together Our last
meeting Mr Rankin have I been unfortunate enough to forget an old
acquaintance

RANKIN Well perhaps hardly an acquaintance Sir Howrrd But I was a
close friend of your brother Miles and when he sailed for Brazil I
was one of the little party that saw him off You were one of the party
also if Im not mistaken I took particular notice of you because you
were Miless brother and I had never seen ye before But ye had no call
to take notice of me

SIR HOWARD reflecting Yes there was a young friend of my brothers
who might well be you But the name as I recollect it was Leslie

RANKIN That was me sir My name is Leslie Rankin and your brother and
I were always Miles and Leslie to one another

SIR HOWARD pluming himself a little Ah that explains it I can trust
my memory still Mr Rankin though some people do complain that I am
growing old

RANKIN And where may Miles be now Sir Howard

SIR HOWARD abruptly Dont you know that he is dead

RANKIN much shocked Never haird of it Dear dear I shall never see
him again and I can scarcely bring his face to mind after all these
years With moistening eyes which at once touch Lady Cicelys
sympathy Im right sorryright sorry

SIR HOWARD decorously subduing his voice Yes he did not live long
indeed he never came back to England It must be nearly thirty years
ago now that he died in the West Indies on his property there

RANKIN surprised His proaperty Miles with a proaperty

SIR HOWARD Yes he became a planter and did well out there Mr
Rankin The history of that property is a very curious and interesting
oneat least it is so to a lawyer like myself

RANKIN I should be glad to hear it for Miless sake though I am no
lawyer Sir Howrrd

LADY CICELY I never knew you had a brother Howard

SIR HOWARD not pleased by this remark Perhaps because you never asked
me Turning more blandly to Rankin I will tell you the story Mr
Rankin When Miles died he left an estate in one of the West Indian
islands It was in charge of an agent who was a sharpish fellow with
all his wits about him Now sir that man did a thing which probably
could hardly be done with impunity even here in Morocco under the most
barbarous of surviving civilizations He quite simply took the estate
for himself and kept it

RANKIN But how about the law

SIR HOWARD The law sir in that island consisted practically of the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General and these gentlemen were
both retained by the agent Consequently there was no solicitor in the
island to take up the case against him

RANKIN Is such a thing possible today in the British Empire

SIR HOWARD calmly Oh quite Quite

LADY CICELY But could not a firstrate solicitor have been sent out from
London

SIR HOWARD No doubt by paying him enough to compensate him for
giving up his London practice that is rather more than there was any
reasonable likelihood of the estate proving worth

RANKIN Then the estate was lost

SIR HOWARD Not permanently It is in my hands at present

RANKIN Then how did ye get it back

SIR HOWARD with crafty enjoyment of his own cunning By hoisting the
rogue with his own petard I had to leave matters as they were for many
years for I had my own position in the world to make But at last I
made it In the course of a holiday trip to the West Indies I found
that this dishonest agent had left the island and placed the estate in
the hands of an agent of his own whom he was foolish enough to pay very
badly I put the case before that agent and he decided to treat the
estate as my property The robber now found himself in exactly the same
position he had formerly forced me into Nobody in the island would
act against me least of all the Attorney and Solicitor General who
appreciated my influence at the Colonial Office And so I got the estate
back The mills of the gods grind slowly Mr Rankin but they grind
exceeding small

LADY CICELY Now I suppose if Id done such a clever thing in England
youd have sent me to prison

SIR HOWARD Probably unless you had taken care to keep outside the law
against conspiracy Whenever you wish to do anything against the law
Cicely always consult a good solicitor first

LADY CICELY So I do But suppose your agent takes it into his head to
give the estate back to his wicked old employer

SIR HOWARD I heartily wish he would

RANKIN openeyed You wish he WOULD

SIR HOWARD Yes A few years ago the collapse of the West Indian sugar
industry converted the income of the estate into an annual loss of
about 150 pounds a year If I cant sell it soon I shall simply abandon
itunless you Mr Rankin would like to take it as a present

RANKIN laughing I thank your lordship we have estates enough of
that sort in Scotland Youre setting with your back to the sun Leddy
Ceecily and losing something worth looking at See there He rises and
points seaward where the rapid twilight of the latitude has begun

LADY CICELY getting up to look and uttering a cry of admiration Oh
how lovely

SIR HOWARD also rising What are those hills over there to the
southeast

RANKIN They are the outposts so to speak of the Atlas Mountains

LADY CICELY The Atlas Mountains Where Shelleys witch lived Well
make an excursion to them tomorrow Howard

RANKIN Thats impoassible my leddy The natives are verra dangerous

LADY CICELY Why Has any explorer been shooting them

RANKIN No But every man of them believes he will go to heaven if he
kills an unbeliever

LADY CICELY Bless you dear Mr Rankin the people in England believe
that they will go to heaven if they give all their property to the poor
But they dont do it Im not a bit afraid of that

RANKIN But they are not accustomed to see women going about unveiled

LADY CICELY I always get on best with people when they can see my face

SIR HOWARD Cicely you are talking great nonsense and you know it
These people have no laws to restrain them which means in plain
English that they are habitual thieves and murderers

RANKIN Nay nay not exactly that

LADY CICELY indignantly Of course not You always think Howard that
nothing prevents people killing each other but the fear of your hanging
them for it But what nonsense that is And how wicked If these people
werent here for some good purpose they wouldnt have been made would
they Mr Rankin

RANKIN That is a point certainly Leddy Ceecily

SIR HOWARD Oh if you are going to talk theology

LADY CICELY Well why not theology is as respectable as law I should
think Besides Im only talking commonsense Why do people get
killed by savages Because instead of being polite to them and
saying Howdyedo like me people aim pistols at them Ive been among
savagescannibals and all sorts Everybody said theyd kill me But
when I met them I said Howdyedo and they were quite nice The kings
always wanted to marry me

SIR HOWARD That does not seem to me to make you any safer here Cicely
You shall certainly not stir a step beyond the protection of the consul
if I can help it without a strong escort

LADY CICELY I dont want an escort

SIR HOWARD I do And I suppose you will expect me to accompany you

RANKIN Tis not safe Leddy Ceecily Really and truly tis not safe
The tribes are verra fierce and there are cities here that no Christian
has ever set foot in If you go without being well protected the first
chief you meet well seize you and send you back again to prevent his
followers murdering you

LADY CICELY Oh how nice of him Mr Rankin

RANKIN He would not do it for your sake Leddy Ceecily but for his
own The Sultan would get into trouble with England if you were killed
and the Sultan would kill the chief to pacify the English government

LADY CICELY But I always go everywhere I KNOW the people here wont
touch me They have such nice faces and such pretty scenery

SIR HOWARD to Rankin sitting down again resignedly You can imagine
how much use there is in talking to a woman who admires the faces of the
ruffians who infest these ports Mr Rankin Can anything be done in the
way of an escort

RANKIN There is a certain Captain Brassbound here who trades along the
coast and occasionally escorts parties of merchants on journeys into
the interior I understand that he served under Gordon in the Soudan

SIR HOWARD That sounds promising But I should like to know a little
more about him before I trust myself in his hands

RANKIN I quite agree with you Sir Howrrd Ill send Felix Drinkwotter
for him He claps his hands An Arab boy appears at the house door
Muley is sailor man here Muley nods Tell sailor man bring captain
Muley nods and goes

SIR HOWARD Who is Drinkwater

RANKIN His agent or mate I dont rightly know which

LADY CICELY Oh if he has a mate named Felix Drinkwater it must be
quite a respectable crew It is such a nice name

RANKIN You saw him here just now He is a convert of mine

LADY CICELY delighted That nice truthful sailor

SIR HOWARD horrified What The Hooligan

RANKIN puzzled Hooligan No my lord he is an Englishman

SIR HOWARD My dear Mr Rankin this man was tried before me on a charge
of street ruffianism

RANKIN So he told me He was badly broat up I am afraid But he is now
a converted man

LADY CICELY Of course he is His telling you so frankly proves it You
know really Howard all those poor people whom you try are more sinned
against than sinning If you would only talk to them in a friendly way
instead of passing cruel sentences on them you would find them quite
nice to you Indignantly I wont have this poor man trampled on merely
because his mother brought him up as a Hooligan I am sure nobody could
be nicer than he was when he spoke to us

SIR HOWARD In short we are to have an escort of Hooligans commanded
by a filibuster Very well very well You will most likely admire all
their faces and I have no doubt at all that they will admire yours

Drinkwater comes from the house with an Italian dressed in a much worn
suit of blue serge a dilapidated Alpine hat and boots laced with
scraps of twine He remains near the door whilst Drinkwater comes
forward between Sir Howard and Lady Cicely

DRINKWATER Yr honors servant To the Italian Mawtzow is lawdship Sr
Ahrd Ellam Marzo touches his hat Er Lidyship Lidy Winefleet Marzo

RANKIN Shall we go indoors to see him

SIR HOWARD I think we had better have a look at him by daylight

RANKIN Then we must lose no time the dark is soon down in this
latitude To Drinkwater Will ye ask him to step out here to us Mr
Drinkwotter

DRINKWATER Rawt you aw gavner He goes officiously into the house

Lady Cicely and Rankin sit down as before to receive the Captain The
light is by this time waning rapidly the darkness creeping west into
the orange crimson

LADY CICELY whispering Dont you feel rather creepy Mr Rankin I
wonder what hell be like

RANKIN I misdoubt me he will not answer your leddyship

There is a scuffling noise in the house and Drinkwater shoots out
through the doorway across the garden with every appearance of having
been violently kicked Marzo immediately hurries down the garden on Sir
Howards right out of the neighborhood of the doorway

DRINKWATER trying to put a cheerful air on much mortification and
bodily anguish Narsty step to thet ere door tripped me hap it
did Raising his voice and narrowly escaping a squeak of pain Kepn
Brarsbahnd He gets as far from the house as possible on Rankins
left Rankin rises to receive his guest

An olive complexioned man with dark southern eyes and hair comes from
the house Age about 36 Handsome features but joyless dark eyebrows
drawn towards one another mouth set grimly nostrils large and
strained a face set to one tragic purpose A man of few words fewer
gestures and much significance On the whole interesting and even
attractive but not friendly He stands for a moment saturnine in the
ruddy light to see who is present looking in a singular and rather
deadly way at Sir Howard then with some surprise and uneasiness at
Lady Cicely Finally he comes down into the middle of the garden and
confronts Rankin who has been glaring at him in consternation from the
moment of his entrance and continues to do so in so marked a way that
the glow in Brassbounds eyes deepens as he begins to take offence

BRASSBOUND Well sir have you stared your fill at me

RANKIN recovering himself with a start I ask your pardon for my bad
manners Captain Brassbound Ye are extraordinair lek an auld college
friend of mine whose face I said not ten minutes gone that I could no
longer bring to mind It was as if he had come from the grave to remind
me of it

BRASSBOUND Why have you sent for me

RANKIN We have a matter of business with ye Captain

BRASSBOUND Who are we

RANKIN This is Sir Howrrd Hallam who will be well known to ye as one
of Her Majestys judges

BRASSBOUND turning the singular look again on Sir Howard The friend
of the widow the protector of the fatherless

SIR HOWARD startled I did not know I was so favorably spoken of in
these parts Captain Brassbound We want an escort for a trip into the
mountains

BRASSBOUND ignoring this announcement Who is the lady

RANKIN Lady Ceecily Waynflete his lordships sisterinlaw

LADY CICELY Howdyedo Captain Brassbound He bows gravely

SIR HOWARD a little impatient of these questions which strike him as
somewhat impertinent Let us come to business if you please We are
thinking of making a short excursion to see the country about here Can
you provide us with an escort of respectable trustworthy men

BRASSBOUND No

DRINKWATER in strong remonstrance Nah nah nah Nah look eah Kepn
yknaow

BRASSBOUND between his teeth Hold your tongue

DRINKWATER abjectly Yuss Kepn

RANKIN I understood it was your business to provide escorts Captain
Brassbound

BRASSBOUND You were rightly informed That IS my business

LADY CICELY Then why wont you do it for us

BRASSBOUND You are not content with an escort You want respectable
trustworthy men You should have brought a division of London policemen
with you My men are neither respectable nor trustworthy

DRINKWATER unable to contain himself Nah nah look eah Kepn If you
want to be moddist be moddist on your aown accahnt nort on mawn

BRASSBOUND You see what my men are like That rascal indicating Marzo
would cut a throat for a dollar if he had courage enough

MARZO I not understand I no spik Englis

BRASSBOUND This thing pointing to Drinkwater is the greatest liar
thief drunkard and rapscallion on the west coast

DRINKWATER affecting an ironic indifference Gow orn Gow orn Sr Ahrd
ez erd witnesses to maw kerrickter afoah E knaows ah mech to believe of
em

LADY CICELY Captain Brassbound I have heard all that before about
the blacks and I found them very nice people when they were properly
treated

DRINKWATER chuckling the Italian is also grinning Nah Kepn nah
Owp yr prahd o yseolf nah

BRASSBOUND I quite understand the proper treatment for him madam If
he opens his mouth again without my leave I will break every bone in
his skin

LADY CICELY in her most sunnily matteroffact way Does Captain
Brassbound always treat you like this Mr Drinkwater

Drinkwater hesitates and looks apprehensively at the Captain

BRASSBOUND Answer you dog when the lady orders you To Lady Cicely
Do not address him as Mr Drinkwater madam he is accustomed to be
called Brandyfaced Jack

DRINKWATER indignantly Eah aw sy nah look eah Kepn maw nime is
Drinkworter You awsk em et Sin Jorns in the Worterleoo Rowd Orn maw
grenfawthers tombstown it is

BRASSBOUND It will be on your own tombstone presently if you cannot
hold your tongue Turning to the others Let us understand one another
if you please An escort here or anywhere where there are no regular
disciplined forces is what its captain makes it If I undertake this
business I shall be your escort I may require a dozen men just as I
may require a dozen horses Some of the horses will be vicious so will
all the men If either horse or man tries any of his viciousness on me
so much the worse for him but it will make no difference to you I will
order my men to behave themselves before the lady and they shall obey
their orders But the lady will please understand that I take my own way
with them and suffer no interference

LADY CICELY Captain Brassbound I dont want an escort at all It will
simply get us all into danger and I shall have the trouble of getting
it out again Thats what escorts always do But since Sir Howard
prefers an escort I think you had better stay at home and let me take
charge of it I know your men will get on perfectly well if theyre
properly treated

DRINKWATER with enthusiasm Feed aht o yr and lidy we would

BRASSBOUND with sardonic assent Good I agree To Drinkwater You
shall go without me

DRINKWATER terrified Eah Wot are you a syin orn We cawnt gow
withaht yer To Lady Cicely Naow lidy it wouldnt be for yr hown
good Yer cawnt hexpect a lot o poor honeddikited men lawk huz to ran
ahrseolvs into dineger withaht naow Kepn to teoll us wot to do Naow

LADY CICELY Oh if you prefer your captain have him by all means Do
you LIKE to be treated as he treats you

DRINKWATER with a smile of vanity Weoll lidy y cawnt deenaw that
es a Paffick Genlmn Bit hawbitrairy preps but hin a genlmn you looks
for sich It tikes a hawbitrairy wanne to knock aht them eathen Shikes
aw teoll yer

BRASSBOUND Thats enough Go

DRINKWATER Weoll aw was hownly a teolln the lidy thet A threatening
movement from Brassbound cuts him short He flies for his life into the
house followed by the Italian

BRASSBOUND Your ladyship sees These men serve me by their own free
choice If they are dissatisfied they go If I am dissatisfied they
go They take care that I am not dissatisfied

SIR HOWARD who has listened with approval and growing confidence
Captain Brassbound you are the man I want If your terms are at
all reasonable I will accept your services if we decide to make an
excursion You do not object Cicely I hope

LADY CICELY Oh no After all those men must really like you Captain
Brassbound I feel sure you have a kind heart You have such nice eyes

SIR HOWARD scandalized My DEAR Cicely you really must restrain your
expressions of confidence in peoples eyes and faces To Brassbound
Now about terms Captain

BRASSBOUND Where do you propose to go

SIR HOWARD I hardly know Where CAN we go Mr Rankin

RANKIN Take my advice Sir Howrrd Dont go far

BRASSBOUND I can take you to Meskala from which you can see the Atlas
Mountains From Meskala I can take you to an ancient castle in the
hills where you can put up as long as you please The customary charge
is half a dollar a man per day and his food I charge double

SIR HOWARD I suppose you answer for your men being sturdy fellows who
will stand to their guns if necessary

BRASSBOUND I can answer for their being more afraid of me than of the
Moors

LADY CICELY That doesnt matter in the least Howard The important
thing Captain Brassbound is first that we should have as few men as
possible because men give such a lot of trouble travelling And then
they must have good lungs and not be always catching cold Above all
their clothes must be of good wearing material Otherwise I shall be
nursing and stitching and mending all the way and it will be trouble
enough I assure you to keep them washed and fed without that

BRASSBOUND haughtily My men madam are not children in the nursery

LADY CICELY with unanswerable conviction Captain Brassbound all men
are children in the nursery I see that you dont notice things That
poor Italian had only one proper bootlace the other was a bit of
string And I am sure from Mr Drinkwaters complexion that he ought to
have some medicine

BRASSBOUND outwardly determined not to be trifled with inwardly
puzzled and rather daunted Madam if you want an escort I can provide
you with an escort If you want a Sunday School treat I can NOT provide
it

LADY CICELY with sweet melancholy Ah dont you wish you could
Captain Oh if I could only show you my children from Waynflete Sunday
School The darlings would love this place with all the camels
and black men Im sure you would enjoy having them here Captain
Brassbound and it would be such an education for your men Brassbound
stares at her with drying lips

SIR HOWARD Cicely when you have quite done talking nonsense to Captain
Brassbound we can proceed to make some definite arrangement with him

LADY CICELY But its arranged already Well start at eight oclock
tomorrow morning if you please Captain Never mind about the Italian
I have a big box of clothes with me for my brother in Rome and there
are some bootlaces in it Now go home to bed and dont fuss yourself
All you have to do is to bring your men round and Ill see to the rest
Men are always so nervous about moving Goodnight She offers him her
hand Surprised he pulls off his cap for the first time Some scruple
prevents him from taking her hand at once He hesitates then turns to
Sir Howard and addresses him with warning earnestness

BRASSBOUND Sir Howard Hallam I advise you not to attempt this
expedition

SIR HOWARD Indeed Why

BRASSBOUND You are safe here I warn you in those hills there is a
justice that is not the justice of your courts in England If you have
wronged a man you may meet that man there If you have wronged a woman
you may meet her son there The justice of those hills is the justice of
vengeance

SIR HOWARD faintly amused You are superstitious Captain Most
sailors are I notice However I have complete confidence in your
escort

BRASSBOUND almost threateningly Take care The avenger may be one of
the escort

SIR HOWARD I have already met the only member of your escort who might
have borne a grudge against me Captain and he was acquitted

BRASSBOUND You are fated to come then

SIR HOWARD smiling It seems so

BRASSBOUND On your head be it To Lady Cicely accepting her hand at
last Goodnight

He goes It is by this time starry night




ACT II

Midday A roam in a Moorish castle A divan seat runs round the
dilapidated adobe walls which are partly painted partly faced with
white tiles patterned in green and yellow The ceiling is made up
of little squares painted in bright colors with gilded edges
and ornamented with gilt knobs On the cement floor are mattings
sheepskins and leathern cushions with geometrical patterns on them
There is a tiny Moorish table in the middle and at it a huge saddle
with saddle cloths of various colors showing that the room is used by
foreigners accustomed to chairs Anyone sitting at the table in this
seat would have the chief entrance a large horseshoe arch on his left
and another saddle seat between him and the arch whilst if susceptible
to draughts he would probably catch cold from a little Moorish door in
the wall behind him to his right

Two or three of Brassbounds men overcome by the midday heat sprawl
supine on the floor with their reefer coats under their heads their
knees uplifted and their calves laid comfortably on the divan Those
who wear shirts have them open at the throat for greater coolness Some
have jerseys All wear boots and belts and have guns ready to their
hands One of them lying with his head against the second saddle seat
wears what was once a fashionable white English yachting suit He is
evidently a pleasantly worthless young English gentleman gone to the
bad but retaining sufficient selfrespect to shave carefully and
brush his hair which is wearing thin and does not seem to have been
luxuriant even in its best days

The silence is broken only by the snores of the young gentleman whose
mouth has fallen open until a few distant shots half waken him He
shuts his mouth convulsively and opens his eyes sleepily A door is
violently kicked outside and the voice of Drinkwater is heard raising
urgent alarm

DRINKWATER Wot ow Wike ap there will yr Wike ap He rushes in
through the horseshoe arch hot and excited and runs round kicking the
sleepers Nah then Git ap Git ap will yr Kiddy Redbrook He gives
the young qentleman a rude shove

REDBOOK sitting up Stow that will you Whats amiss

DRINKWATER disgusted Wots amiss Didnt eah naow fawrin I spowse

with a copious pagri on his white hat enters through the horseshoe
arch followed by a couple of men supporting the wounded Marzo who
weeping and terrorstricken by the prospect of death and of subsequent
torments for which he is conscious of having eminently qualified
himself has his coat off and a bandage round his chest One of his
supporters is a blackbearded thickset slow middleaged man with an
air of damaged respectability namedas it afterwards appearsJohnson
Lady Cicely walks beside Marzo Redbrook a little shamefaced crosses
the room to the opposite wall as far away as possible from the visitors
Drinkwater turns and receives them with jocular ceremony Weolcome

Lady Cicely comes to Drinkwater

LADY CICELY Where is Marzos bed

They deposit Marzo on the flags against the wall close to the little

DRINKWATER whimpering You lee me alown awm gowin Theres nmaw true

Noontn Corzwy coppers Newington Causeway policemen

As he slinks away in tears towards the arch Brassbound enters
Drinkwater promptly shelters himself on the captains left hand the
others retreating to the opposite side as Brassbound advances to the
middle of the room Sir Howard retires behind them and seats himself on
the divan much fatigued

BRASSBOUND to Drinkwater What are you snivelling at

DRINKWATER You awsk the wust cowst herristorcracy They fawnds maw
cornduck hanbecammin to a genlmn

Brassbound is about to ask Johnson for an explanation when Lady Cicely
returns through the little door and comes between Brassbound and
Drinkwater

LADY CICELY to Drinkwater Have you fetched the water

DRINKWATER Yuss nah YOU begin orn me He weeps afresh

LADY CICELY surprised Oh This wont do Mr Drinkwater If you cry
I cant let you nurse your friend

DRINKWATER frantic Thetll brike maw awt wownt it nah With a
lamentable sob he throws himself down on the divan raging like an
angry child

LADY CICELY after contemplating him in astonishment for a moment
Captain Brassbound are there any charwomen in the Atlas Mountains

BRASSBOUND There are people here who will work if you pay them as
there are elsewhere

LADY CICELY This castle is very romantic Captain but it hasnt had a
spring cleaning since the Prophet lived in it Theres only one room I
can put that wounded man into Its the only one that has a bed in it
the second room on the right out of that passage

BRASSBOUND haughtily That is my room madam

LADY CICELY relieved Oh thats all right It would have been so
awkward if I had had to ask one of your men to turn out You wont mind
I know All the men stare at her Even Drinkwater forgets his sorrows
in his stupefaction

BRASSBOUND Pray madam have you made any arrangements for my
accommodation

LADY CICELY reassuringly Yes you can have my room instead wherever
it may be Im sure you chose me a nice one I must be near my
patient and I dont mind roughing it Now I must have Marzo moved very
carefully Where is that truly gentlemanly Mr Johnsonoh there you

back hastily out of her way with every expression frozen out of his face
except one of extreme and indignant dumbfoundedness Will you ask
your strong friend to help you with Marzo strong people are always so
gentle

JOHNSON Let me introdooce Mr Redbrook Your ladyship may know his
father the very Rev Dean Redbrook He goes to Marzo

REDBROOK Happy to oblige you Lady Cicely

BRASSBOUND to Sir Howard I wish you to understand Sir Howard that

good enough to let Lady Cicely Waynflete know that

SIR HOWARD sitting up on the divan and pulling himself together You
will have ample opportunity for speaking to Lady Cicely yourself when
she returns Drinkwater chuckles and the rest grin

BRASSBOUND My manners are rough Sir Howard I have no wish to frighten
the lady

SIR HOWARD Captain Brassbound if you can frighten Lady Cicely you
will confer a great obligation on her family If she had any sense of
danger perhaps she would keep out of it

BRASSBOUND Well sir if she were ten Lady Cicelys she must consult me
while she is here

DRINKWATER Thets rawt kepn Lets eah you steblish yr hawthority
Brassbound turns impatiently on him He retreats remonstrating Nah

SIR HOWARD If you feel at all nervous Captain Brassbound I will

BRASSBOUND Nervous sir no Nervousness is not in my line You
will find me perfectly capable of saying what I want to saywith
considerable emphasis if necessary Sir Howard assents with a polite
but incredulous nod

DRINKWATER Eah eah

Lady Cicely returns with Johnson and Redbrook She carries a jar

LADY CICELY stopping between the door and the arch Now for the water
Where is it

REDBROOK Theres a well in the courtyard Ill come and work the
bucket

JOHNSON Well Marzos in your bed Lady wants to make a kitchen of
the Sheikhs audience chamber and to put me and the Kid handy in his
bedroom in case Marzo gets erysipelas and breaks out violent From what
I can make out she means to make herself matron of this institution I

DRINKWATER Yuss an horder huz abaht as if we was keb tahts An the

Lady Cicely returns with Redbrook She carries the jar full of water

Drinkwater as before And now Captain before I go to poor Marzo what

BRASSBOUND I Nothing

DRINKWATER Downt fank it gavner Be a men

LADY CICELY looking at Drinkwater puzzled Mr Drinkwater said you

BRASSBOUND recovering himself It was only this That fellow there
pointing to Drinkwater is subject to fits of insolence If he is
impertinent to your ladyship or disobedient you have my authority to
order him as many kicks as you think good for him and I will see that
he gets them

DRINKWATER lifting up his voice in protest Nah nah

LADY CICELY Oh I couldnt think of such a thing Captain Brassbound I

DRINKWATER lachrymosely Lidys hinkypble o sich bawbrous usage

LADY CICELY But theres one thing I SHOULD like if Mr Drinkwater
wont mind my mentioning it Its so important if hes to attend on

BRASSBOUND What is that

DRINKWATER suspiciously Wot is it

DRINKWATER aghast A bawth

BRASSBOUND in tones of command Stand by all hands They stand by
Take that man and wash him With a roar of laughter they seize him

DRINKWATER in an agony of protest Naow naow Look eah

BRASSBOUND ruthlessly In COLD water

DRINKWATER shrieking Naaaaow Aw eawnt aw toel yer Naow Aw

He is dragged away through the arch in a whirlwind of laughter protests
and tears

LADY CICELY Im afraid he isnt used to it poor fellow but REALLY it
will do him good Captain Brassbound Now I must be off to my patient
She takes up her jar and goes out by the little door leaving
Brassbound and Sir Howard alone together

SIR HOWARD rising And now Captain Brass

BRASSBOUND cutting him short with a fierce contempt that astonishes
him I will attend to you presently Calling Johnson Send me Johnson
there And Osman He pulls off his coat and throws it on the table
standing at his ease in his blue jersey

SIR HOWARD after a momentary flush of anger with a controlled force
that compels Brassbounds attention in spite of himself You seem to be
in a strong position with reference to these men of yours

BRASSBOUND I am in a strong position with reference to everyone in this
castle

SIR HOWARD politely but threateningly I have just been noticing that
you think so I do not agree with you Her Majestys Government Captain
Brassbound has a strong arm and a long arm If anything disagreeable
happens to me or to my sisterinlaw that arm will be stretched out If
that happens you will not be in a strong position Excuse my reminding
you of it

BRASSBOUND grimly Much good may it do you Johnson comes in through
the arch Where is Osman the Sheikhs messenger I want him too

JOHNSON Coming Captain He had a prayer to finish

Osman a tall skinny whiteclad elderly Moor appears in the archway

BRASSBOUND Osman Ali Osman comes forward between Brassbound and
Johnson you have seen this unbeliever indicating Sir Howard come in
with us

OSMAN Yea and the shameless one with the naked face who flattered my
countenance and offered me her hand

JOHNSON Yes and you took it too Johnny didnt you

BRASSBOUND Take horse then and ride fast to your master the Sheikh
Sidi el Assif

OSMAN proudly Kinsman to the Prophet

BRASSBOUND Tell him what you have seen here That is all Johnson give
him a dollar and note the hour of his going that his master may know
how fast he rides

OSMAN The believers word shall prevail with Allah and his servant Sidi
el Assif

BRASSBOUND Off with you

OSMAN Make good thy masters word ere I go out from his presence O
Johnson el Hull

JOHNSON He wants the dollar

Brassbound gives Osman a coin

OSMAN bowing Allah will make hell easy for the friend of Sidi el
Assif and his servant He goes out through the arch

BRASSBOUND to Johnson Keep the men out of this until the Sheikh
comes I have business to talk over When he does come we must keep
together all Sidi el Assifs natural instinct will be to cut every
Christian throat here

JOHNSON We look to you Captain to square him since you invited him
over

BRASSBOUND You can depend on me and you know it I think

JOHNSON phlegmatically Yes we know it He is going out when Sir
Howard speaks

SIR HOWARD You know also Mr Johnson I hope that you can depend on
ME

JOHNSON turning On YOU sir

SIR HOWARD Yes on me If my throat is cut the Sultan of Morocco may
send Sidis head with a hundred thousand dollars bloodmoney to the
Colonial Office but it will not be enough to save his kingdomany more
than it would saw your life if your Captain here did the same thing

JOHNSON struck Is that so Captain

BRASSBOUND I know the gentlemans valuebetter perhaps than he knows
it himself I shall not lose sight of it

Johnson nods gravely and is going out when Lady Cicely returns softly
by the little door and calls to him in a whisper She has taken off her
travelling things and put on an apron At her chatelaine is a case of
sewing materials

LADY CICELY Mr Johnson He turns Ive got Marzo to sleep Would you
mind asking the gentlemen not to make a noise under his window in the
courtyard

JOHNSON Right maam He goes out

Lady Cicely sits down at the tiny table and begins stitching at a sling
bandage for Marzos arm Brassbound walks up and down on her right
muttering to himself so ominously that Sir Howard quietly gets out of
his way by crossing to the other side and sitting down on the second
saddle seat

SIR HOWARD Are you yet able to attend to me for a moment Captain
Brassbound

BRASSBOUND still walking about What do you want

SIR HOWARD Well I am afraid I want a little privacy and if you will
allow me to say so a little civility I am greatly obliged to you for
bringing us safely off today when we were attacked So far you have
carried out your contract But since we have been your guests here
your tone and that of the worst of your men has changedintentionally
changed I think

BRASSBOUND stopping abruptly and flinging the announcement at him You
are not my guest you are my prisoner

SIR HOWARD Prisoner

Lady Cicely after a single glance up continues stitching apparently
quite unconcerned

BRASSBOUND I warned you You should have taken my warning

SIR HOWARD immediately taking the tone of cold disgust for moral
delinquency Am I to understand then that you are a brigand Is this
a matter of ransom

BRASSBOUND with unaccountable intensity All the wealth of England
shall not ransom you

SIR HOWARD Then what do you expect to gain by this

BRASSBOUND Justice on a thief and a murderer

Lady Cicely lays down her work and looks up anxiously

SIR HOWARD deeply outraged rising with venerable dignity Sir do you
apply those terms to me

BRASSBOUND I do He turns to Lady Cicely and adds pointing
contemptuously to Sir Howard Look at him You would not take this
virtuously indignant gentleman for the uncle of a brigand would you

Sir Howard starts The shock is too much for him he sits down again
looking very old and his hands tremble but his eyes and mouth are
intrepid resolute and angry

LADY CICELY Uncle What do you mean

BRASSBOUND Has he never told you about my mother this fellow who puts
on ermine and scarlet and calls himself Justice

SIR HOWARD almost voiceless You are the son of that woman

BRASSBOUND fiercely That woman He makes a movement as if to rush
at Sir Howard

LADY CICELY rising quickly and putting her hand on his arm Take care
You mustnt strike an old man

BRASSBOUND raging He did not spare my motherthat woman he
calls herbecause of her sex I will not spare him because of his age
Lowering his tone to one of sullen vindictiveness But I am not going
to strike him Lady Cicely releases him and sits down much perplexed
Brassbound continues with an evil glance at Sir Howard I shall do no
more than justice

SIR HOWARD recovering his voice and vigor Justice I think you mean
vengeance disguised as justice by your passions

BRASSBOUND To many and many a poor wretch in the dock YOU have brought
vengeance in that disguisethe vengeance of society disguised as
justice by ITS passions Now the justice you have outraged meets you
disguised as vengeance How do you like it

SIR HOWARD I shall meet it I trust as becomes an innocent man and an
upright judge What do you charge against me

BRASSBOUND I charge you with the death of my mother and the theft of my
inheritance

SIR HOWARD As to your inheritance sir it was yours whenever you came
forward to claim it Three minutes ago I did not know of your existence
I affirm that most solemnly I never knewnever dreamtthat my brother
Miles left a son As to your mother her case was a hard oneperhaps
the hardest that has come within even my experience I mentioned it as
such to Mr Rankin the missionary the evening we met you As to her
death you knowyou MUST knowthat she died in her native country
years after our last meeting Perhaps you were too young to know that
she could hardly have expected to live long

BRASSBOUND You mean that she drank

SIR HOWARD I did not say so I do not think she was always accountable
for what she did

BRASSBOUND Yes she was mad too and whether drink drove her to madness
or madness drove her to drink matters little The question is who drove
her to both

SIR HOWARD I presume the dishonest agent who seized her estate did I
repeat it was a hard casea frightful injustice But it could not be
remedied

BRASSBOUND You told her so When she would not take that false answer
you drove her from your doors When she exposed you in the street and
threatened to take with her own hands the redress the law denied her
you had her imprisoned and forced her to write you an apology and
leave the country to regain her liberty and save herself from a lunatic
asylum And when she was gone and dead and forgotten you found for
yourself the remedy you could not find for her You recovered the estate
easily enough then robber and rascal that you are Did he tell the
missionary that Lady Cicely eh

LADY CICELY sympathetically Poor woman To Sir Howard Couldnt you
have helped her Howard

SIR HOWARD No This man may be ignorant enough to suppose that when
I was a struggling barrister I could do everything I did when I was
Attorney General You know better There is some excuse for his mother
She was an uneducated Brazilian knowing nothing of English society and
driven mad by injustice

BRASSBOUND Your defence

SIR HOWARD interrupting him determinedly I do not defend myself I
call on you to obey the law

BRASSBOUND I intend to do so The law of the Atlas Mountains is
administered by the Sheikh Sidi el Assif He will be here within an
hour He is a judge like yourself You can talk law to him He will give
you both the law and the prophets

SIR HOWARD Does he know what the power of England is

BRASSBOUND He knows that the Mahdi killed my master Gordon and that
the Mahdi died in his bed and went to paradise

SIR HOWARD Then he knows also that Englands vengeance was on the
Mahdis track

BRASSBOUND Ay on the track of the railway from the Cape to Cairo Who
are you that a nation should go to war for you If you are missing
what will your newspapers say A foolhardy tourist What will your
learned friends at the bar say That it was time for you to make room
for younger and better men YOU a national hero You had better find
a goldfield in the Atlas Mountains Then all the governments of Europe
will rush to your rescue Until then take care of yourself for you are
going to see at last the hypocrisy in the sanctimonious speech of the
judge who is sentencing you instead of the despair in the white face of
the wretch you are recommending to the mercy of your God

SIR HOWARD deeply and personally offended by this slight to his
profession and for the first time throwing away his assumed dignity
and rising to approach Brassbound with his fists clenched so that Lady
Cicely lifts one eye from her work to assure herself that the table is
between them I have no more to say to you sir I am not afraid
of you nor of any bandit with whom you may be in league As to your
property it is ready for you as soon as you come to your senses and
claim it as your fathers heir Commit a crime and you will become
an outlaw and not only lose the property but shut the doors of
civilization against yourself for ever

BRASSBOUND I will not sell my mothers revenge for ten properties

LADY CICELY placidly Besides really Howard as the property now
costs 150 pounds a year to keep up instead of bringing in anything I am
afraid it would not be of much use to him Brassbound stands amazed at
this revelation

SIR HOWARD taken aback I must say Cicely I think you might have
chosen a more suitable moment to mention that fact

BRASSBOUND with disgust Agh Trickster Lawyer Even the price you
offer for your life is to be paid in false coin Calling Hallo there
Johnson Redbrook Some of you there To Sir Howard You ask for a
little privacy you shall have it I will not endure the company of such
a fellow

SIR HOWARD very angry and full of the crustiest pluck You insult me
sir You are a rascal You are a rascal

Johnson Redbrook and a few others come in through the arch

BRASSBOUND Take this man away

JOHNSON Where are we to put him

BRASSBOUND Put him where you please so long as you can find him when he
is wanted

SIR HOWARD You will be laid by the heels yet my friend

REDBROOK with cheerful tact Tut tut Sir Howard whats the use of
talking back Come along well make you comfortable

Sir Howard goes out through the arch between Johnson and Redbrook
muttering wrathfully The rest except Brassbound and Lady Cicely
follow

Brassbound walks up and down the room nursing his indignation In doing
so he unconsciously enters upon an unequal contest with Lady Cicely who
sits quietly stitching It soon becomes clear that a tranquil woman
can go on sewing longer than an angry man can go on fuming Further it
begins to dawn on Brassbounds wrathblurred perception that Lady Cicely
has at some unnoticed stage in the proceedings finished Marzos bandage
and is now stitching a coat He stops glances at his shirtsleeves
finally realizes the situation

BRASSBOUND What are you doing there madam

LADY CICELY Mending your coat Captain Brassbound

BRASSBOUND I have no recollection of asking you to take that trouble

LADY CICELY No I dont suppose you even knew it was torn Some men
are BORN untidy You cannot very well receive Sidi elwhats his
namewith your sleeve half out

BRASSBOUND disconcerted II dont know how it got torn

LADY CICELY You should not get virtuously indignant with people It
bursts clothes more than anything else Mr Hallam

BRASSBOUND flushing quickly I beg you will not call me Mr Hallam I
hate the name

LADY CICELY Black Paquito is your pet name isnt it

BRASSBOUND huffily I am not usually called so to my face

LADY CICELY turning the coat a little Im so sorry She takes
another piece of thread and puts it into her needle looking placidly
and reflectively upward meanwhile Do you know You are wonderfully
like your uncle

BRASSBOUND Damnation

LADY CICELY Eh

BRASSBOUND If I thought my veins contained a drop of his black blood
I would drain them empty with my knife I have no relations I had a
mother that was all

LADY CICELY unconvinced I daresay you have your mothers complexion
But didnt you notice Sir Howards temper his doggedness his high
spirit above all his belief in ruling people by force as you rule
your men and in revenge and punishment just as you want to revenge
your mother Didnt you recognize yourself in that

BRASSBOUND startled Myselfin that

LADY CECILY returning to the tailoring question as if her last remark
were of no consequence whatever Did this sleeve catch you at all under
the arm Perhaps I had better make it a little easier for you

BRASSBOUND irritably Let my coat alone It will do very well as it
is Put it down

LADY CICILY Oh dont ask me to sit doing nothing It bores me so

BRASSBOUND In Heavens name then do what you like Only dont worry me
with it

LADY CICELY Im so sorry All the Hallams are irritable

BRASSBOUND penning up his fury with difficulty As I have already
said that remark has no application to me

LADY CICELY resuming her stitching Thats so funny They all hate to
be told that they are like one another

BRASSBOUND with the beginnings of despair in his voice Why did you
come here My trap was laid for him not for you Do you know the danger
you are in

LADY CICELY Theres always a danger of something or other Do you think
its worth bothering about

BRASSBOUND scolding her Do I THINK Do you think my coats worth
mending

LADY CICELY prosaically Oh yes its not so far gone as that

BRASSBOUND Have you any feeling Or are you a fool

LADY CICELY Im afraid Im a dreadful fool But I cant help it I was
made so I suppose

BRASSBOUND Perhaps you dont realize that your friend my good uncle
will be pretty fortunate if he is allowed to live out his life as a
slave with a set of chains on him

LADY CICELY Oh I dont know about that Mr HI mean Captain
Brassbound Men are always thinking that they are going to do something
grandly wicked to their enemies but when it comes to the point really
bad men are just as rare as really good ones

BRASSBOUND You forget that I am like my uncle according to you Have
you any doubt as to the reality of HIS badness

LADY CICELY Bless me your uncle Howard is one of the most harmless
of menmuch nicer than most professional people Of course he does
dreadful things as a judge but then if you take a man and pay him 5000
pounds a year to be wicked and praise him for it and have policemen
and courts and laws and juries to drive him into it so that he cant
help doing it what can you expect Sir Howards all right when hes
left to himself We caught a burglar one night at Waynflete when he was
staying with us and I insisted on his locking the poor man up until the
police came in a room with a window opening on the lawn The man came
back next day and said he must return to a life of crime unless I gave
him a job in the garden and I did It was much more sensible than
giving him ten years penal servitude Howard admitted it So you see
hes not a bit bad really

BRASSBOUND He had a fellow feeling for a thief knowing he was a thief
himself Do you forget that he sent my mother to prison

LADY CICELY softly Were you very fond of your poor mother and always
very good to her

BRASSBOUND rather taken aback I was not worse than other sons I
suppose

LADY CICELY opening her eyes very widely Oh Was THAT all

BRASSBOUND exculpating himself full of gloomy remembrances You dont
understand It was not always possible to be very tender with my mother
She had unfortunately a very violent temper and sheshe

LADY CICELY Yes so you told Howard With genuine pity for him You
must have had a very unhappy childhood

BRASSBOUND grimily Hell That was what my childhood was Hell

LADY CICELY Do you think she would really have killed Howard as she
threatened if he hadnt sent her to prison

BRASSBOUND breaking out again with a growing sense of being morally
trapped What if she did Why did he rob her Why did he not help her
to get the estate as he got it for himself afterwards

LADY CICELY He says he couldnt you know But perhaps the real reason
was that he didnt like her You know dont you that if you dont like
people you think of all the reasons for not helping them and if you
like them you think of all the opposite reasons

BRASSBOUND But his duty as a brother

LADY CICELY Are you going to do your duty as a nephew

BRASSBOUND Dont quibble with me I am going to do my duty as a son
and you know it

LADY CICELY But I should have thought that the time for that was in
your mothers lifetime when you could have been kind and forbearing
with her Hurting your uncle wont do her any good you know

BRASSBOUND It will teach other scoundrels to respect widows and
orphans Do you forget that there is such a thing as justice

LADY CICELY gaily shaking out the finished coat Oh if you are going
to dress yourself in ermine and call yourself Justice I give you up
You are just your uncle over again only he gets L5000 a year for it
and you do it for nothing

She holds the coat up to see whether any further repairs are needed

BRASSBOUND sulkily You twist my words very cleverly But no man or
woman has ever changed me

LADY CICELY Dear me That must be very nice for the people you deal
with because they can always depend on you but isnt it rather
inconvenient for yourself when you change your mind

BRASSBOUND I never change my mind

LADY CICELY rising with the coat in her hands Oh Oh Nothing will
ever persuade me that you are as pigheaded as that

BRASSBOUND offended Pigheaded

LADY CICELY with quick caressing apology No no no I didnt mean
that Firm Unalterable Resolute Ironwilled Stonewall Jackson Thats
the idea isnt it

BRASSBOUND hopelessly You are laughing at me

LADY CICELY No trembling I assure you Now will you try this on for
me Im SO afraid I have made it too tight under the arm She holds it
behind him

BRASSBOUND obeying mechanically You take me for a fool I think He
misses the sleeve

LADY CICELY No all men look foolish when they are feeling for their
sleeves

BRASSBOUND Agh He turns and snatches the coat from her then puts it
on himself and buttons the lowest button

LADY CICELY horrified Stop No You must NEVER pull a coat at the
skirts Captain Brassbound it spoils the sit of it Allow me She
pulls the lappels of his coat vigorously forward Put back your
shoulders He frowns but obeys Thats better She buttons the top
button Now button the rest from the top down DOES it catch you at all
under the arm

BRASSBOUND miserablyall resistance beaten out of him No

LADY CICELY Thats right Now before I go back to poor Marzo say thank
you to me for mending your jacket like a nice polite sailor

BRASSBOUND sitting down at the table in great agitation Damn you
you have belittled my whole life to me He bows his head on his hands
convulsed

LADY CICELY quite understanding and putting her hand kindly on his
shoulder Oh no I am sure you have done lots of kind things and brave
things if you could only recollect them With Gordon for instance
Nobody can belittle that

He looks up at her for a moment then kisses her hand She presses his
and turns away with her eyes so wet that she sees Drinkwater coming in
through the arch just then with a prismatic halo round him Even when
she sees him clearly she hardly recognizes him for he is ludicrously
clean and smoothly brushed and his hair formerly mud color is now a
lively red

DRINKWATER Look eah kepn Brassbound springs up and recovers himself
quickly Eahs the bloomin Shike jest appeahd on the orawzn wiv abaht
fifty men Thyll be eah insawd o ten minnits they will

LADY CICELY The Sheikh

BRASSBOUND Sidi el Assif and fifty men To Lady Cicely You were too
late I gave you up my vengeance when it was no longer in my hand To
Drinkwater Call all hands to stand by and shut the gates Then all here
to me for orders and bring the prisoner

DRINKWATER Rawt kepn He runs out

LADY CICELY Is there really any danger for Howard

BRASSBOUND Yes Danger for all of us unless I keep to my bargain with
this fanatic

LADY CICELY What bargain

BRASSBOUND I pay him so much a head for every party I escort through to
the interior In return he protects me and lets my caravans alone But
I have sworn an oath to him to take only Jews and true believersno
Christians you understand

LADY CICELY Then why did you take us

BRASSBOUND I took my uncle on purposeand sent word to Sidi that he
was here

LADY CICELY Well thats a pretty kettle of fish isnt it

BRASSBOUND I will do what I can to save himand you But I fear my
repentance has come too late as repentance usually does

LADY CICELY cheerfully Well I must go and look after Marzo at all
events She goes out through the little door Johnson Redbrook and the
rest come in through the arch with Sir Howard still very crusty and
determined He keeps close to Johnson who comes to Brassbounds right
Redbrook taking the other side

BRASSBOUND Wheres Drinkwater

JOHNSON On the lookout Look here Capn we dont half like this job
The gentleman has been talking to us a bit and we think that he IS a
gentleman and talks straight sense

REDBROOK Righto Brother Johnson To Brassbound Wont do governor
Not good enough

BRASSBOUND fiercely Mutiny eh

REDBROOK Not at all governor Dont talk Tommy rot with Brother Sidi
only five minutes gallop off Cant hand over an Englishman to a nigger
to have his throat cut

BRASSBOUND unexpectedly acquiescing Very good You know I suppose
that if you break my bargain with Sidi youll have to defend this place
and fight for your lives in five minutes That cant be done without
discipline you know that too Ill take my part with the rest under
whatever leader you are willing to obey So choose your captain and look
sharp about it Murmurs of surprise and discontent

VOICES No no Brassbound must command

BRASSBOUND Youre wasting your five minutes Try Johnson

JOHNSON No I havent the head for it

BRASSBOUND Well Redbrook

REDBROOK Not this Johnny thank you Havent character enough

BRASSBOUND Well theres Sir Howard Hallam for You HE has character
enough

A VOICE Hes too old

ALL No no Brassbound Brassbound

JOHNSON Theres nobody but you Captain

REDRROOK The mutinys over governor You win hands down

BRASSBOUND turning on them Now listen you all of you If I am to
command here I am going to do what I like not what you like Ill give
this gentleman here to Sidi or to the devil if I choose Ill not be
intimidated or talked back to Is that understood

REDBROOK diplomatically Hes offered a present of five hundred quid
if he gets safe back to Mogador governor Excuse my mentioning it

SIR HOWARD Myself AND Lady Cicely

BRASSBOUND What A judge compound a felony You greenhorns he is more
likely to send you all to penal servitude if you are fools enough to
give him the chance

VOICES So he would Whew Murmurs of conviction

REDBROOK Righto governor Thats the ace of trumps

BRASSBOUND to Sir Howard Now have you any other card to play Any
other bribe Any other threat Quick Time presses

SIR HOWARD My life is in the hands of Providence Do your worst

BRASSBOUND Or my best I still have that choice

DRINKWATER running in Look eah kepn Eahs anather lot cammin from

BRASSBOUND cutting him short Now then do you understand plain
English Johnson and Redbrook take what men you want and open the gates

JOHNSON Ay ay sir

REDBROOK Righto governor

They hurry out with a few others Drinkwater stares after them
dumbfounded by their obedience

BRASSBOUND taking out a pistol You wanted to sell me to my prisoner
did you you dog

DRINKWATER falling on his knees with a yell Naow Brassbound turns
on him as if to kick him He scrambles away and takes refuge behind Sir
Howard

BRASSBOUND Sir Howard Hallam you have one chance left The Cadi of
Kintafi stands superior to the Sheikh as the responsible governor of the
whole province It is the Cadi who will be sacrificed by the Sultan if
England demands satisfaction for any injury to you If we can hold the
Sheikh in parley until the Cadi arrives you may frighten the Cadi into
forcing the Sheikh to release you The Cadis coming is a lucky chance
for YOU

SIR HOWARD If it were a real chance you would not tell me of it Dont
try to play cat and mouse with me man

DRINKWATER aside to Sir Howard as Brassbound turns contemptuously away
to the other side of the room It ynt mach of a chawnst Sr Ahrd But
if there was a ganbowt in Mogador Awbr awd put a bit on it aw would

Johnson Redbrook and the others return rather mistrustfully ushering
in Sidi el Assif attended by Osman and a troop of Arabs Brassbounds
men keep together on the archway side backing their captain Sidis
followers cross the room behind the table and assemble near Sir Howard
who stands his ground Drinkwater runs across to Brassbound and stands
at his elbow as he turns to face Sidi

Sidi el Aasif clad in spotless white is a nobly handsome Arab hardly
thirty with fine eyes bronzed complexion and instinctively dignified
carriage He places himself between the two groups with Osman in
attendance at his right hand

OSMAN pointing out Sir Howard This is the infidel Cadi Sir Howard
bows to Sidi but being an infidel receives only the haughtiest stare
in acknowledgement This pointing to Brassbound is Brassbound the
Franguestani captain the servant of Sidi

DRINKWATER not to be outdone points out the Sheikh and Osman to
Brassbound This eah is the Commawnder of the Fythful an is Vizzeer
Rosman

SIDI Where is the woman

OSMAN The shameless one is not here

BRASSBOUND Sidi el Assif kinsman of the Prophet you are welcome

REDBROOK with much aplomb There is no majesty and no might save in
Allah the Glorious the Great

DRINKWATER Eah eah

OSMAN to Sidi The servant of the captain makes his profession of
faith as a true believer

SIDI It is well

BRASSBOUND aside to Redbrook Where did you pick that up

REDRROOK aside to Brassbound Captain Burtons Arabian Nightscopy in
the library of the National Liberal Club

LADY CICELY calling without Mr Drinkwater Come and help me with
Marzo The Sheikh pricks up his ears His nostrils and eyes expand

OSMAN The shameless one

BRASSBOUND to Drinkwater seizing him by the collar and slinging him
towards the door Off with you

Drinkwater goes out through the little door

OSMAN Shall we hide her face before she enters

SIDI NO

Lady Cicely who has resumed her travelling equipment and has her hat
slung across her arm comes through the little door supporting Marzo
who is very white but able to get about Drinkwater has his other arm
Redbrook hastens to relieve Lady Cicely of Marzo taking him into the
group behind Brassbound Lady Cicely comes forward between Brassbound
and the Sheikh to whom she turns affably

LADY CICELY proffering her hand Sidi el Assif isnt it How dye do
He recoils blushing somewhat

OSMAN scandalized Woman touch not the kinsman of the Prophet

LADY CICELY Oh I see Im being presented at court Very good She
makes a presentation curtsey

REDBROOK Sidi el Assif this is one of the mighty women Sheikhs of
Franguestan She goes unveiled among Kings and only princes may touch
her hand

LADY CICELY Allah upon thee Sidi el Assif Be a good little Sheikh
and shake hands

SIDI timidly touching her hand Now this is a wonderful thing and
worthy to be chronicled with the story of Solomon and the Queen of
Sheba Is it not so Osman Ali

OSMAN Allah upon thee master it is so

SIDI Brassbound Ali the oath of a just man fulfils itself without many
words The infidel Cadi thy captive falls to my share

BRASSBOUND firmly It cannot be Sidi el Assif Sidis brows contract
gravely The price of his blood will be required of our lord the
Sultan I will take him to Morocco and deliver him up there

SIDI impressively Brassbound I am in mine own house and amid mine
own people I am the Sultan here Consider what you say for when my
word goes forth for life or death it may not be recalled

BRASSBOUND Sidi el Assif I will buy the man from you at what price you
choose to name and if I do not pay faithfully you shall take my head
for his

SIDI It is well You shall keep the man and give me the woman in
payment

SIR HOWARD AND BRASSBOUND with the same impulse No no

LADY CICELY eagerly Yes yes Certainly Mr Sidi Certainly

Sidi smiles gravely

SIR HOWARD Impossible

BRASSBOUND You dont know what youre doing

LADY CICELY Oh dont I Ive not crossed Africa and stayed with six
cannibal chiefs for nothing To the Sheikh Its all right Mr Sidi I
shall be delighted

SIR HOWARD You are mad Do you suppose this man will treat you as a
European gentleman would

LADY CICELY No hell treat me like one of Natures gentlemen look at
his perfectly splendid face Addressing Osman as if he were her oldest
and most attached retainer Osman be sure you choose me a good horse
and get a nice strong camel for my luggage

Osman after a moment of stupefaction hurries out Lady Cicely puts
on her hat and pins it to her hair the Sheikh gazing at her during the
process with timid admiration

DRINKWATER chuckling Shell mawch em all to church next Sunder lawk a
bloomin lot o cherrity kids you see if she doesnt

LADY CICELY busily Goodbye Howard dont be anxious about me and
above all dont bring a parcel of men with guns to rescue me I
shall be all right now that I am getting away from the escort Captain
Brassbound I rely on you to see that Sir Howard gets safe to Mogador
Whispering Take your hand off that pistol He takes his hand out of
his pocket reluctantly Goodbye

A tumult without They all turn apprehensively to the arch Osman rushes
in

OSMAN The Cadi the Cadi He is in anger His men are upon us Defend

The Cadi a vigorous fatfeatured choleric whitehaired and bearded
elder rushes in cudgel in hand with an overwhelming retinue and
silences Osman with a sounding thwack In a moment the back of the room
is crowded with his followers The Sheikh retreats a little towards his
men and the Cadi comes impetuously forward between him and Lady Cicely

THE CADI Now woe upon thee Sidi el Assif thou child of mischief

SIDI sternly Am I a dog Muley Othman that thou speakest thus to me

THE CADI Wilt thou destroy thy country and give us all into the hands
of them that set the sea on fire but yesterday with their ships of war
Where are the Franguestani captives

LADY CICELY Here we are Cadi How dye do

THE CADI Allah upon thee thou moon at the full Where is thy kinsman
the Cadi of Franguestan I am his friend his servant I come on behalf
of my master the Sultan to do him honor and to cast down his enemies

SIR HOWARD You are very good I am sure

SIDI graver than ever Muley Othman

TAE CADI fumbling in his breast Peace peace thou inconsiderate one
He takes out a letter

BRASSBOUND Cadi

THE CADI Oh thou dog thou thou accursed Brassbound son of a wanton
it is thou hast led Sidi el Assif into this wrongdoing Read this
writing that thou hast brought upon me from the commander of the
warship

BRASSBOUND Warship He takes the letter and opens it his men
whispering to one another very lowspiritedly meanwhile

REDBROOK Warship Whew

JOHNSON Gunboat praps

DRINKWATER Lawk bloomin Worterleoo buses they are on this cowst

Brassbound folds up the letter looking glum

SIR HOWARD sharply Well sir are we not to have the benefit of that
letter Your men are waiting to hear it I think

BRASSBOUND It is not a British ship Sir Howards face falls

LADY CICELY What is it then

BRASSBOUND An American cruiser The Santiago

THE CADI tearing his beard Woe alas it is where they set the sea on
fire

SIDI Peace Muley Othman Allah is still above us

JOHNSON Would you mind readin it to us capn

BRASSBOUND grimly Oh Ill read it to you Mogador Harbor 26 Sept
1899 Captain Hamlin Kearney of the cruiser Santiago presents the
compliments of the United States to the Cadi Muley Othman el Kintafi
and announces that he is coming to look for the two British travellers
Sir Howard Hallam and Lady Cicely Waynflete in the Cadis jurisdiction
As the search will be conducted with machine guns the prompt return of
the travellers to Mogador Harbor will save much trouble to all parties

THE CADI As I live O Cadi and thou moon of loveliness ye shall be
led back to Mogador with honor And thou accursed Brassbound shall go
thither a prisoner in chains thou and thy people Brassbound and his
men make a movement to defend themselves Seize them

LADY CICELY Oh please dont fight Brassbound seeing that his men
are hopelessly outnumbered makes no resistance They are made prisoners
by the Cadis followers

SIDI attempting to draw his scimitar The woman is mine I will not
forego her He is seized and overpowered after a Homeric struggle

SIR HOWARD drily I told you you were not in a strong position
Captain Brassbound Looking implacably at him You are laid by the
heels my friend as I said you would be

LADY CICELY But I assure you

BRASSBOUND interrupting her What have you to assure him of You
persuaded me to spare him Look at his face Will you be able to
persuade him to spare me




ACT III

Torrid forenoon filtered through small Moorish windows high up in the
adobe walls of the largest room in Leslie Rankins house A clean
cool room with the table a Christian article set in the middle a
presidentially elbowed chair behind it and an inkstand and paper ready
for the sitter A couple of cheap American chairs right and left of the
table facing the same way as the presidential chair give a judicial
aspect to the arrangement Rankin is placing a little tray with a jug
and some glasses near the inkstand when Lady Cicelys voice is heard at
the door which is behind him in the corner to his right

LADE CICELY Good morning May I come in

RANKIN Certainly She comes in to the nearest end of the table She
has discarded all travelling equipment and is dressed exactly as she
might be in Surrey on a very hot day Sit ye doon Leddy Ceecily

LADY CICELY sitting down How nice youve made the room for the
inquiry

RANKIN doubtfully I could wish there were more chairs Yon American
captain will preside in this and that leaves but one for Sir Howrrd and
one for your leddyship I could almost be tempted to call it a maircy
that your friend that owns the yacht has sprained his ankle and cannot
come I misdoubt me it will not look judeecial to have Captain Kearneys
officers squatting on the floor

LADY CICELY Oh they wont mind What about the prisoners

RANKIN They are to be broat here from the town gaol presently

LADY CICELY And where is that silly old Cadi and my handsome Sheikh
Sidi I must see them before the inquiryor theyll give Captain Kearney
quite a false impression of what happened

RANKIN But ye cannot see them They decamped last night back to their
castles in the Atlas

LADY CICELY delighted No

RANKIN Indeed and they did The poor Cadi is so terrified by all he
has haird of the destruction of the Spanish fleet that he darent trust
himself in the captains hands Looking reproachfully at her On your
journey back here ye seem to have frightened the poor man yourself
Leddy Ceecily by talking to him about the fanatical Chreestianity of
the Americans Ye have largely yourself to thank if hes gone

LADY CICELY Allah be praised WHAT a weight off our minds Mr Rankin

RANKIN puzzled And why Do ye not understand how necessary their
evidence is

LADY CICELY THEIR evidence It would spoil everything They would
perjure themselves out of pure spite against poor Captain Brassbound

RANKIN amazed Do ye call him POOR Captain Brassbound Does not your
leddyship know that this Brasshound isHeaven forgive me for judging
hima precious scoundrel Did ye not hear what Sir Howrrd told me on
the yacht last night

LADY CICELY All a mistake Mr Rankin all a mistake I assure you
You said just now Heaven forgive you for judging him Well thats just
what the whole quarrel is about Captain Brassbound is just like you
he thinks we have no right to judge one another and its Sir Howard gets
L5000 a year for doing nothing else but judging people he thinks poor
Captain Brassbound a regular Anarchist They quarreled dreadfully at
the castle You mustnt mind what Sir Howard says about him you really
mustnt

RANKIN But his conduct

LADY CICELY Perfectly saintly Mr Rankin Worthy of yourself in your
best moments He forgave Sir Howard and did all he could to save him

RANKIN Ye astoanish me Leddy Ceecily

LADY CICELY And think of the temptation to behave badly when he had us
all there helpless

RANKIN The temptation ay thats true Yere ower bonny to be cast
away among a parcel o lone lawless men my leddy

LADY CICELY naively Bless me thats quite true and I never thought
of it Oh after that you really must do all you can to help Captain
Brassbound

RANKIN reservedly No I cannot say that Leddy Ceecily I doubt he
has imposed on your good nature and sweet disposeetion I had a crack
with the Cadi as well as with Sir Howrrd and there is little question in
my mind but that Captain Brassbound is no better than a breegand

LADY CICELY apparently deeply impressed I wonder whether he can be
Mr Rankin If you think so thats heavily against him in my opinion
because you have more knowledge of men than anyone else here Perhaps
Im mistaken I only thought you might like to help him as the son of
your old friend

RANKIN startled The son of my old friend What dye mean

LADY CICELY Oh Didnt Sir Howard tell you that Why Captain
Brassbound turns out to be Sir Howards nephew the son of the brother
you knew

RANKIN overwhelmed I saw the likeness the night he came here Its
true its true Uncle and nephew

LADY CICELY Yes thats why they quarrelled so

RANKIN with a momentary sense of ill usage I think Sir Howrrd might
have told me that

LADY CICELY Of course he OUGHT to have told you You see he only tells
one side of the story That comes from his training as a barrister You
mustnt think hes naturally deceitful if hed been brought up as a
clergyman hed have told you the whole truth as a matter of course

RANKIN too much perturbed to dwell on his grievance Leddy Ceecily I
must go to the prison and see the lad He may have been a bit wild but
I cant leave poor Miless son unbefriended in a foreign gaol

LADY CICELY rising radiant Oh how good of you You have a real kind
heart of gold Mr Rankin Now before you go shall we just put our
heads together and consider how to give Miless son every chanceI
mean of course every chance that he ought to have

RANKIN rather addled I am so confused by this astoanishing news

LADY CICELY Yes yes of course you are But dont you think he would
make a better impression on the American captain if he were a little
more respectably dressed

RANKIN Mebbe But how can that be remedied here in Mogador

LADY CICELY Oh Ive thought of that You know Im going back to
England by way of Rome Mr Rankin and Im bringing a portmanteau full
of clothes for my brother there hes ambassador you know and has to
be VERY particular as to what he wears I had the portmanteau brought
here this morning Now WOULD you mind taking it to the prison and
smartening up Captain Brassbound a little Tell him he ought to do it to
show his respect for me and he will It will be quite easy there are
two Krooboys waiting to carry the portmanteau You will I know you
will She edges him to the door And do you think there is time to get
him shaved

RANKIN succumbing half bewildered Ill do my best

LADY CICELY I know you will As he is going out Oh one word Mr
Rankin He comes back The Cadi didnt know that Captain Brassbound
was Sir Howards nephew did he

RANKIN No

LADY CICELY Then he must have misunderstood everything quite
dreadfully Im afraid Mr Rankinthough you know best of
coursethat we are bound not to repeat anything at the inquiry that the
Cadi said He didnt know you see

RANKIN cannily I take your point Leddy Ceecily It alters the case
I shall certainly make no allusion to it

LADY CICELY magnanimously Well then I wont either There They
shake hands on it Sir Howard comes in

SIR HOWARD Good morning Mr Rankin I hope you got home safely from the
yacht last night

RANKIN Quite safe thank ye Sir Howrrd

LADY CICELY Howard hes in a hurry Dont make him stop to talk

SIR HOWARD Very good very good He comes to the table and takes Lady
Cicelys chair

RANKIN Oo revoir Leddy Ceecily

LADY CICELY Bless you Mr Rankin Rankin goes out She comes to
the other end of the table looking at Sir Howard with a troubled
sorrowfully sympathetic air but unconsciously making her right hand
stalk about the table on the tips of its fingers in a tentative stealthy
way which would put Sir Howard on his guard if he were in a suspicious
frame of mind which as it happens he is not Im so sorry for you
Howard about this unfortunate inquiry

SIR HOWARD swinging round on his chair astonished Sorry for ME Why

LADY CICELY It will look so dreadful Your own nephew you know

SIR HOWARD Cicely an English judge has no nephews no sons even when
he has to carry out the law

LADY CICELY But then he oughtnt to have any property either People
will never understand about the West Indian Estate Theyll think youre
the wicked uncle out of the Babes in the Wood With a fresh gush of
compassion Im so SO sorry for you

SIR HOWARD rather stiffly I really do not see how I need your
commiseration Cicely The woman was an impossible person half mad
half drunk Do you understand what such a creature is when she has a
grievance and imagines some innocent person to be the author of it

LADY CICELY with a touch of impatience Oh quite THATll be made
clear enough I can see it all in the papers already our half mad
half drunk sisterinlaw making scenes with you in the street with the
police called in and prison and all the rest of it The family will
be furious Sir Howard quails She instantly follows up her advantage
with Think of papa

SIR HOWARD I shall expect Lord Waynflete to look at the matter as a
reasonable man

LADY CICELY Do you think hes so greatly changed as that Howard

SIR HOWARD falling back on the fatalism of the depersonalized public
man My dear Cicely there is no use discussing the matter It cannot
be helped however disagreeable it may be

LADY CICELY Of course not Thats whats so dreadful Do you think
people will understand

SIR HOWARD I really cannot say Whether they do or not I cannot help
it

LADY CICELY If you were anybody but a judge it wouldnt matter so
much But a judge mustnt even be misunderstood Despairingly Oh its
dreadful Howard its terrible What would poor Mary say if she were
alive now

SIR HOWARD with emotion I dont think Cicely that my dear wife
would misunderstand me

LADY CICELY No SHED know you mean well And when you came home and
said Mary Ive just told all the world that your sisterinlaw was a
police court criminal and that I sent her to prison and your nephew is
a brigand and Im sending HIM to prison shed have thought it must be
all right because you did it But you dont think she would have LIKED
it any more than papa and the rest of us do you

SIR HOWARD appalled But what am I to do Do you ask me to compound a
felony

LADY CICELY sternly Certainly not I would not allow such a thing
even if you were wicked enough to attempt it No What I say is that
you ought not to tell the story yourself

SIR HOWARD Why

LADY CICELY Because everybody would say you are such a clever lawyer
you could make a poor simple sailor like Captain Kearney believe
anything The proper thing for you to do Howard is to let ME tell the
exact truth Then you can simply say that you are bound to confirm me
Nobody can blame you for that

SIR HOWARD looking suspiciously at her Cicely you are up to some
devilment

LADY CICELY promptly washing her hands of his interests Oh very
well Tell the story yourself in your own clever way I only proposed
to tell the exact truth You call that devilment So it is I daresay
from a lawyers point of view

SIR HOWARD I hope youre not offended

LADY CICELY with the utmost goodhumor My dear Howard not a bit Of
course youre right you know how these things ought to be done Ill do
exactly what you tell me and confirm everything you say

SIR HOWARD alarmed by the completeness of his victory Oh my dear
you mustnt act in MY interest You must give your evidence with
absolute impartiality She nods as if thoroughly impressed and
reproved and gazes at him with the steadfast candor peculiar to liars
who read novels His eyes turn to the ground and his brow clouds
perplexedly He rises rubs his chin nervously with his forefinger and
adds I think perhaps on reflection that there is something to be
said for your proposal to relieve me of the very painful duty of telling
what has occurred

LADI CICELY holding off But youd do it so very much better

SIR HOWARD For that very reason perhaps it had better come from you

LADY CICELY reluctantly Well if youd rather

SIR HOWARD But mind Cicely the exact truth

LADY CICELY with conviction The exact truth They shake hands on
it

SIR HOWARD holding her hand Fiat justitia ruat coelum

LADY CICELY Let Justice be done though the ceiling fall

An American bluejacket appears at the door

BLUEJACKET Captain Kearneys cawmpliments to Lady Waynflete and may he
come in

LADY CICELY Yes By all means Where are the prisoners

BLUEJACKET Party gawn to the jail to fetch em marm

LADY CICELY Thank you I should like to be told when they are coming
if I might

BLUEJACKET You shall so marm He stands aside saluting to admit his
captain and goes out

Captain Hamlin Kearney is a robustly built western American with the
keen squeezed wind beaten eyes and obstinately enduring mouth of his
profession A curious ethnological specimen with all the nations of
the old world at war in his veins he is developing artificially in
the direction of sleekness and culture under the restraints of an
overwhelming dread of European criticism and climatically in the
direction of the indiginous North American who is already in possession
of his hair his cheekbones and the manlier instincts in him which
the sea has rescued from civilization The world pondering on the great
part of its own future which is in his hands contemplates him with
wonder as to what the devil he will evolve into in another century or
two Meanwhile he presents himself to Lady Cicely as a blunt sailor who
has something to say to her concerning her conduct which he wishes to
put politely as becomes an officer addressing a lady but also with an
emphatically implied rebuke as an American addressing an English person
who has taken a liberty

LADY CICELY as he enters So glad youve come Captain Kearney

KEARNEY coming between Sir Howard and Lady Cicely When we parted
yesterday ahfternoon Lady Waynflete I was unaware that in the
course of your visit to my ship you had entirely altered the sleeping
arrangements of my stokers I thahnk you As captain of the ship I
am customairily cawnsulted before the orders of English visitors are
carried out but as your alterations appear to cawndooce to the comfort
of the men I have not interfered with them

LADY CICELY How clever of you to find out I believe you know every
bolt in that ship

Kearney softens perceptibly

SIR HOWARD I am really very sorry that my sisterinlaw has taken so
serious a liberty Captain Kearney It is a mania of herssimply a
mania Why did your men pay any attention to her

KEARNEY with gravely dissembled humor Well I ahsked that question
too I said Why did you obey that ladys orders instead of waiting for
mine They said they didnt see exactly how they could refuse I ahsked
whether they cawnsidered that discipline They said Well sir will you
talk to the lady yourself next time

LADY CICELY Im so sorry But you know Captain the one thing that one
misses on board a manofwar is a woman

KEARNEY We often feel that deprivation verry keenly Lady Waynflete

LADY CICELY My uncle is first Lord of the Admiralty and I am always
telling him what a scandal it is that an English captain should be
forbidden to take his wife on board to look after the ship

KEARNEY Stranger still Lady Waynflete he is not forbidden to take any
other lady Yours is an extraordinairy countryto an Amerrican

LADY CICELY But its most serious Captain The poor men go melancholy
mad and ram each others ships and do all sorts of things

SIR HOWARD Cicely I beg you will not talk nonsense to Captain Kearney
Your ideas on some subjects are really hardly decorous

LADY CICELY to Kearney Thats what English people are like Captain
Kearney They wont hear of anything concerning you poor sailors except
Nelson and Trafalgar YOU understand me dont you

KEARNEY gallantly I cawnsider that you have more sense in your
wedding ring finger than the British Ahdmiralty has in its whole
cawnstitootion Lady Waynflete

LADY CICELY Of course I have Sailors always understand things

The bluejacket reappears

BLUEJACKET to Lady Cicely Prisoners coming up the hill marm

KEARNEY turning sharply on him Who sent you in to say that

BLUEJACKET calmly British ladys orders sir He goes out
unruffled leaving Kearney dumbfounded

SIR HOWARD contemplating Kearneys expression with dismay I am really
very sorry Captain Kearney I am quite aware that Lady Cicely has no
right whatever to give orders to your men

LADY CICELY I didnt give orders I just asked him He has such a nice
face Dont you think so Captain Kearney He gasps speechless And
now will you excuse me a moment I want to speak to somebody before the
inquiry begins She hurries out

KEARNEY There is sertnly a wonderful chahrn about the British
aristocracy Sir Howard Hallam Are they all like that He takes the
presidential chair

SIR HOWARD resuming his seat on Kearneys right Fortunately not
Captain Kearney Half a dozen such women would make an end of law in
England in six months

The bluejacket comes to the door again

BLUEJACKET All ready sir

KEARNEY Verry good Im waiting

The bluejacket turns and intimates this to those without

The officers of the Santiago enter

SIR HOWARD rising and bobbing to them in a judicial manner Good
morning gentlemen

They acknowledge the greeting rather shyly bowing or touching their
caps and stand in a group behind Kearney

KEARNEY to Sir Howard You will be glahd to hear that I have a verry
good account of one of our prisoners from our chahplain who visited
them in the gaol He has expressed a wish to be cawnverted to
Episcopalianism

SIR HOWARD drily Yes I think I know him

KEARNEY Bring in the prisoners

BLUEJACKET at the door They are engaged with the British lady sir
Shall I ask her

KEARNEY jumping up and exploding in storm piercing tones Bring in the
prisoners Tell the lady those are my orders Do you hear Tell her so
The bluejacket goes out dubiously The officers look at one another in
mute comment on the unaccountable pepperiness of their commander

SIR HOWARD suavely Mr Rankin will be present I presume

KEARNEY angrily Rahnkin Who is Rahnkin

SIR HOWARD Our host the missionary

KEARNEY subsiding unwillingly Oh Rahnkin is he Hed better look
sharp or hell be late Again exploding What are they doing with
those prisoners

Rankin hurries in and takes his place near Sir Howard

SIR HOWARD This is Mr Rankin Captain Kearney

RANKIN Excuse my delay Captain Kearney The leddy sent me on an
errand Kearney grunts I thought I should be late But the first
thing I heard when I arrived was your officer giving your compliments to
Leddy Ceecily and would she kindly allow the prisoners to come in as
you were anxious to see her again Then I knew I was in time

KEARNEY Oh that was it was it May I ask sir did you notice any
sign on Lady Waynfletes part of cawmplying with that verry moderate
request

LADY CICELY outside Coming coming

The prisoners are brought in by a guard of armed bluejackets

Drinkwater first again elaborately clean and conveying by a virtuous
and steadfast smirk a cheerful confidence in his innocence Johnson
solid and inexpressive Redbrook unconcerned and debonair Marzo uneasy
These four form a little group together on the captains left The rest
wait unintelligently on Providence in a row against the wall on the
same side shepherded by the bluejackets The first bluejacket a petty
officer posts himself on the captains right behind Rankin and Sir
Howard Finally Brassbound appears with Lady Cicely on his arm He is
in fashionable frock coat and trousers spotless collar and cuffs
and elegant boots He carries a glossy tall hat in his hand To an
unsophisticated eye the change is monstrous and appalling and its
effect on himself is so unmanning that he is quite out of countenancea
shaven Samson Lady Cicely however is greatly pleased with it and the
rest regard it as an unquestionable improvement The officers fall back
gallantly to allow her to pass Kearney rises to receive her and stares
with some surprise at Brassbound as he stops at the table on his left
Sir Howard rises punctiliously when Kearney rises and sits when he sits

KEARNEY Is this another gentleman of your party Lady Waynflete I
presume I met you lahst night sir on board the yacht

BRASSBOUND No I am your prisoner My name is Brassbound

DRINKWATER officiously Kepn Brarsbahnd of the schooner Thenksgiv

REDBROOK hastily Shut up you fool He elbows Drinkwater into the
background

KEARNEY surprised and rather suspicious Well I hardly understahnd
this However if you are Captain Brassbound you can take your place
with the rest Brassbound joins Redbrook and Johnson Kearney sits down
again after inviting Lady Cicely with a solemn gesture to take the
vacant chair Now let me see You are a man of experience in these
matters Sir Howard Hallam If you had to conduct this business how
would you start

LADY CICELY Hed call on the counsel for the prosecution wouldnt you
Howard

SIR HOWARD But there is no counsel for the prosecution Cicely

LADY CICELY Oh yes there is Im counsel for the prosecution You
mustnt let Sir Howard make a speech Captain Kearney his doctors have
positively forbidden anything of that sort Will you begin with me

KEARNEY By your leave Lady Waynfiete I think I will just begin with
myself Sailor fashion will do as well here as lawyer fashion

LADY CICELY Ever so much better dear Captain Kearney Silence
Kearney composes himself to speak She breaks out again You look so
nice as a judge

A general smile Drinkwater splutters into a half suppressed laugh

REDBROOK in a fierce whisper Shut up you fool will you Again he
pushes him back with a furtive kick

SIR HOWARD remonstrating Cicely

KEARNEY grimly keeping his countenance Your ladyships cawmpliments
will be in order at a later stage Captain Brassbound the position
is this My ship the United States cruiser Santiago was spoken off
Mogador latest Thursday by the yacht Redgauntlet The owner of the
aforesaid yacht who is not present through having sprained his ankle
gave me sertn information In cawnsequence of that information the
Santiago made the twenty knots to Mogador Harbor inside of fiftyseven
minutes Before noon next day a messenger of mine gave the Cadi of the
district sertn information In cawnsequence of that information the Cadi
stimulated himself to some ten knots an hour and lodged you and your
men in Mogador jail at my disposal The Cadi then went back to his
mountain fahstnesses so we shall not have the pleasure of his company
here today Do you follow me so far

BRASSBOUND Yes I know what you did and what the Cadi did The point
is why did you do it

KEARNEY With doo patience we shall come to that presently Mr Rahnkin
will you kindly take up the parable

RANKIN On the very day that Sir Howrrd and Lady Cicely started on their
excursion I was applied to for medicine by a follower of the Sheikh Sidi
el Assif He told me I should never see Sir Howrrd again because his
master knew he was a Christian and would take him out of the hands of
Captain Brassbound I hurried on board the yacht and told the owner to
scour the coast for a gunboat or cruiser to come into the harbor and
put persuasion on the authorities Sir Howard turns and looks at Rankin
with a sudden doubt of his integrity as a witness

KEARNEY But I understood from our chahplain that you reported Captain
Brassbound as in league with the Sheikh to deliver Sir Howard up to him

RANKIN That was my first hasty conclusion Captain Kearney But it
appears that the compact between them was that Captain Brassbound should
escort travellers under the Sheikhs protection at a certain payment
per head provided none of them were Christians As I understand it he
tried to smuggle Sir Howrrd through under this compact and the Sheikh
found him out

DRINKWATER Rawt gavner Thets jest ah it wors The Kepn

REDBROOK again suppressing him Shut up you fool I tell you

SIR HOWARD to Rankin May I ask have you had any conversation with
Lady Cicely on this subject

RANKIN naively Yes Sir Howard qrunts emphatically as who should
say I thought so Rankin continues addressing the court May I say
how sorry I am that there are so few chairs Captain and gentlemen

KEARNEY with genial American courtesy Oh THATs all right Mr
Rahnkin Well I see no harm so far its human fawlly but not human
crime Now the counsel for the prosecution can proceed to prosecute The
floor is yours Lady Waynflete

LADY CICELY rising I can only tell you the exact truth

DRINKWATER involuntarily Naow downt do thet lidy

REDBROOK as before SHUT up you fool will you

LADY CICELY We had a most delightful trip in the hills and Captain
Brassbounds men could not have been nicerI must say that for
themuntil we saw a tribe of Arabssuch nice looking menand then
the poor things were frightened

KEARNEY The Arabs

LADY CICELY No Arabs are never frightened The escort of course
escorts are always frightened I wanted to speak to the Arab chief but
Captain Brassbound cruelly shot his horse and the chief shot the Count
and then

KEARNEY The Count What Count

LADY CICELY Marzo Thats Marzo pointing to Marzo who grins and
touches his forehead

KEARNEY slightly overwhelmed by the unexpected profusion of incident
and character in her story Well what happened then

LADY CICELY Then the escort ran awayall escorts doand dragged me
into the castle which you really ought to make them clean and whitewash
thoroughly Captain Kearney Then Captain Brassbound and Sir Howard
turned out to be related to one another sensation and then of course
there was a quarrel The Hallams always quarrel

SIR HOWARD rising to protest Cicely Captain Kearney this man told
me

LADY CICELY swiftly interrupting him You mustnt say what people told
you its not evidence Sir Howard chokes with indignation

KEARNEY calmly Allow the lady to proceed Sir Howard Hallam

SIR HOWARD recovering his selfcontrol with a gulp and resuming his
seat I beg your pardon Captain Kearney

LADY CICELY Then Sidi came

KEARNEY Sidney Who was Sidney

LADY CICELY No Sidi The Sheikh Sidi el Assif A noble creature with
such a fine face He fell in love with me at first sight

SIR HOWARD remonstrating Cicely

LADY CICELY He did you know he did You told me to tell the exact
truth

KEARNEY I can readily believe it madam Proceed

LADY CICELY Well that put the poor fellow into a most cruel dilemma
You see he could claim to carry off Sir Howard because Sir Howard is a
Christian But as I am only a woman he had no claim to me

KEARNEY somewhat sternly suspecting Lady Cicely of aristocratic
atheism But you are a Christian woman

LADY CICELY No the Arabs dont count women They dont believe we have
any souls

RANKIN That is true Captain the poor benighted creatures

LADY CICELY Well what was he to do He wasnt in love with Sir Howard
and he WAS in love with me So he naturally offered to swop Sir Howard
for me Dont you think that was nice of him Captain Kearney

KEARNEY I should have done the same myself Lady Waynflete Proceed

LADY CICELY Captain Brassbound I must say was nobleness itself in
spite of the quarrel between himself and Sir Howard He refused to give
up either of us and was on the point of fighting for us when in came
the Cadi with your most amusing and delightful letter captain and
bundled us all back to Mogador after calling my poor Sidi the most
dreadful names and putting all the blame on Captain Brassbound So here
we are Now Howard isnt that the exact truth every word of it

SIR HOWARD It is the truth Cicely and nothing but the truth But the
English law requires a witness to tell the WHOLE truth

LADY CICELY What nonsense As if anybody ever knew the whole truth
about anything Sitting down much hurt and discouraged Im sorry you
wish Captain Kearney to understand that I am an untruthful witness

SIR HOWARD No but

LADY CICELY Very well then please dont say things that convey that
impression

KEARNEY But Sir Howard told me yesterday that Captain Brassbound
threatened to sell him into slavery

LADY CICELY springing up again Did Sir Howard tell you the things he
said about Captain Brassbounds mother Renewed sensation I told you
they quarrelled Captain Kearney I said so didnt I

REDBROOK crisply Distinctly Drinkwater opens his mouth to
corroborate Shut up you fool

LADY CICELY Of course I did Now Captain Kearney do YOU want medoes
Sir Howard want medoes ANYBODY want me to go into the details of
that shocking family quarrel Am I to stand here in the absence of any
individual of my own sex and repeat the language of two angry men

KEARNEY rising impressively The United States navy will have no
hahnd in offering any violence to the pure instincts of womanhood Lady
Waynflete I thahnk you for the delicacy with which you have given
your evidence Lady Cicely beams on him gratefully and sits down
triumphant Captain Brassbound I shall not hold you respawnsible
for what you may have said when the English bench addressed you in the
language of the English forecastle Sir Howard is about to protest
No Sir Howard Hallam excuse ME In moments of pahssion I have called
a man that myself We are glahd to find real flesh and blood beneath the
ermine of the judge We will all now drop a subject that should never
have been broached in a ladys presence He resumes his seat and adds
in a businesslike tone Is there anything further before we release
these men

BLUEJACKET There are some dawcuments handed over by the Cadi sir He
reckoned they were sort of magic spells The chahplain ordered them to
be reported to you and burnt with your leave sir

KEARNEY What are they

BLUEJACKET reading from a list Four books torn and dirty made up of
separate numbers value each wawn penny and entitled Sweeny Todd the
Demon Barber of London The Skeleton Horseman

DRINKWATER rushing forward in painful alarm and anxiety Its maw
lawbrary gavner Downt burn em

KEARNEY Youll be better without that sort of reading my man

DRINKWATER in intense distress appealing to Lady Cicely Downt let
em burn em Lidy They dasnt if you horder them not to With desperate
eloquence Yer dunno wot them books is to me They took me aht of the
sawdid reeyellities of the Worterleoo Rowd They formed maw mawnd they
shaowed me sathink awgher than the squalor of a corsters lawf

REDBROOK collaring him Oh shut up you fool Get out Hold your ton

DRINKWATER frantically breaking from him Lidy lidy sy a word for
me Ev a feelin awt His tears choke him he clasps his hands in dumb
entreaty

LADY CICELY touched Dont burn his books Captain Let me give them
back to him

KEARNEY The books will be handed over to the lady

DRINKWATER in a small voice Thenkyer Lidy He retires among his
comrades snivelling subduedly

REDBROOK aside to him as he passes You silly ass you Drinkwater
sniffs and does not reply

KEARNEY I suppose you and your men accept this ladys account of what
passed Captain Brassbound

BRASSBOUND gloomily Yes It is trueas far as it goes

KEARNEY impatiently Do you wawnt it to go any further

MARZO She leave out something Arab shoot me She nurse me She cure
me

KEARNEY And who are you pray

MARZO seized with a sanctimonious desire to demonstrate his higher
nature Only dam thief Dam liar Dam rascal She no lady

JOHNSON revolted by the seeming insult to the English peerage from a
low Italian What Whats that you say

MARZO No lady nurse dam rascal Only saint She saint She get me to
heavenget us all to heaven We do what we like now

LADY CICELY Indeed you will do nothing of the sort Marzo unless you
like to behave yourself very nicely indeed What hour did you say we
were to lunch at Captain Kearney

KEARNEY You recall me to my dooty Lady Waynflete My barge will be
ready to take off you and Sir Howard to the Santiago at one oclawk He
rises Captain Brassbound this innquery has elicited no reason why I
should detain you or your men I advise you to ahct as escort in future
to heathens exclusively Mr Rahnkin I thahnk you in the name of the
United States for the hospitahlity you have extended to us today and
I invite you to accompany me bahck to my ship with a view to lunch at
halfpast one Gentlemen we will wait on the governor of the gaol on
our way to the harbor He goes out following his officers and followed
by the bluejackets and the petty officer

SIR HOWARD to Lady Cicely Cicely in the course of my professional
career I have met with unscrupulous witnesses and I am sorry to say
unscrupulous counsel also But the combination of unscrupulous witness
and unscrupulous counsel I have met today has taken away my breath You
have made me your accomplice in defeating justice

LADY CICELY Yes arent you glad its been defeated for once She
takes his arm to go out with him Captain Brassbound I will come back
to say goodbye before I go He nods gloomily She goes out with Sir
Howard following the Captain and his staff

RANKIN running to Brassbound and taking both his hands Im right glad
yere cleared Ill come back and have a crack with ye when yon lunch is
over God bless ye Hs goes out quickly

Brassbound and his men left by themselves in the room free and
unobserved go straight out of their senses They laugh they dance
they embrace one another they set to partners and waltz clumsily they
shake hands repeatedly and maudlinly Three only retain some sort of
selfpossession Marzo proud of having successfully thrust himself into
a leading part in the recent proceedings and made a dramatic speech
inflates his chest curls his scanty moustache and throws himself
into a swaggering pose chin up and right foot forward despising the
emotional English barbarians around him Brassbounds eyes and
the working of his mouth show that he is infected with the general
excitement but he bridles himself savagely Redbrook trained to affect
indifference grins cynically winks at Brassbound and finally relieves
himself by assuming the character of a circus ringmaster flourishing an
imaginary whip and egging on the rest to wilder exertions A climax is
reached when Drinkwater let loose without a stain on his character for
the second time is rapt by belief in his star into an ecstasy in which
scorning all partnership he becomes as it were a whirling dervish
and executes so miraculous a clog dance that the others gradually cease
their slower antics to stare at him

BRASSBOUND tearing off his hat and striding forward as Drinkwater
collapses exhausted and is picked up by Redbrook Now to get rid of
this respectable clobber and feel like a man again Stand by all hands
to jump on the captains tall hat He puts the hat down and prepares to
jump on it The effect is startling and takes him completely aback
His followers far from appreciating his iconoclasm are shocked into
scandalized sobriety except Redbrook who is immensely tickled by their
prudery

DRINKWATER Naow look eah kepn that ynt rawt Dror a lawn somewhere

JOHNSON I say nothin agen a bit of fun Capn but lets be gentlemen

REDBROOK I suggest to you Brassbound that the clobber belongs to Lady
Sis Aint you going to give it back to her

BRASSBOUND picking up the hat and brushing the dust off it anxiously
Thats true Im a fool All the same she shall not see me again like
this He pulls off the coat and waistcoat together Does any man here
know how to fold up this sort of thing properly

REDBROOK Allow me governor He takes the coat and waistcoat to the
table and folds them up

BRASSBOUND loosening his collar and the front of his shirt
Brandyfaced Jack youre looking at these studs I know whats in your
mind

DRINKWATER indignantly Naow yer downt nort a bit on it Wots in
maw mawnd is secrifawce seolfsecrifawce

BRASSBOUND If one brass pin of that ladys property is missing Ill
hang you with my own hands at the gaff of the Thanksgivingand would
if she were lying under the guns of all the fleets in Europe He pulls
off the shirt and stands in his blue jersey with his hair ruffled He
passes his hand through it and exclaims Now I am half a man at any
rate

REDBROOK A horrible combination governor churchwarden from the waist
down and the rest pirate Lady Sis wont speak to you in it

BRASSBOUND Ill change altogether He leaves the room to get his own
trousers

REDBROOK softly Look here Johnson and gents generally They gather
about him Spose she takes him back to England

MARZO trying to repeat his success Im Im only dam pirate She saint
I tell youno take any man nowhere

JOHNSON severely Dont you be a ignorant and immoral foreigner The
rebuke is well received and Marzo is hustled into the background and
extinguished She wont take him for harm but she might take him for
good And then where should we be

DRINKWATER Brarsbahnd ynt the ownly kepn in the world Wot mikes a kepn
is brines an knollidge o lawf It ynt thet thers naow sitch pusson
its thet you dunno where to look fr im The implication that he is
such a person is so intolerable that they receive it with a prolonged
burst of booing

BRASSBOUND returning in his own clothes getting into his jacket as
he comes Stand by all They start asunder guiltily and wait for
orders Redbrook you pack that clobber in the ladys portmanteau and
put it aboard the yacht for her Johnson you take all hands aboard the
Thanksgiving look through the stores weigh anchor and make all ready
for sea Then send Jack to wait for me at the slip with a boat and give
me a gunfire for a signal Lose no time

JOHNSON Ay ay air All aboard mates

ALL Ay ay They rush out tumultuously

When they are gone Brassbound sits down at the end of the table with
his elbows on it and his head on his fists gloomily thinking Then he
takes from the breast pocket of his jacket a leather case from which he
extracts a scrappy packet of dirty letters and newspaper cuttings These
he throws on the table Next comes a photograph in a cheap frame He
throws it down untenderly beside the papers then folds his arms and
is looking at it with grim distaste when Lady Cicely enters His back
is towards her and he does not hear her Perceiving this she shuts the
door loudly enough to attract his attention He starts up

LADY CICELY coming to the opposite end of the table So youve taken
off all my beautiful clothes

BRASSBOUND Your brothers you mean A man should wear his own clothes
and a man should tell his own lies Im sorry you had to tell mine for
me today

LADY CICELY Oh women spend half their lives telling little lies for
men and sometimes big ones Were used to it But mind I dont admit
that I told any today

BRASSBOUND How did you square my uncle

LADY CICELY I dont understand the expression

BRASSBOUND I mean

LADY CICELY Im afraid we havent time to go into what you mean before
lunch I want to speak to you about your future May I

BRASSBOUND darkening a little but politely Sit down She sits down
So does he

LADY CICELY What are your plans

BRASSBOUND I have no plans You will hear a gun fired in the harbor
presently That will mean that the Thanksgivings anchors weighed and
that she is waiting for her captain to put out to sea And her captain
doesnt know now whether to turn her head north or south

LADY CICELY Why not north for England

BRASSBOUND Why not south for the Pole

LADY CICELY But you must do something with yourself

BRASSBOUND settling himself with his fists and elbows weightily on the
table and looking straight and powerfully at her Look you when you
and I first met I was a man with a purpose I stood alone I saddled
no friend woman or man with that purpose because it was against law
against religion against my own credit and safety But I believed in
it and I stood alone for it as a man should stand for his belief
against law and religion as much as against wickedness and selfishness
Whatever I may be I am none of your fairweather sailors thatll do
nothing for their creed but go to Heaven for it I was ready to go to
hell for mine Perhaps you dont understand that

LADY CICELY Oh bless you yes Its so very like a certain sort of man

BRASSBOUND I daresay but Ive not met many of that sort Anyhow
that was what I was like I dont say I was happy in it but I wasnt
unhappy because I wasnt drifting I was steering a course and had work
in hand Give a man health and a course to steer and hell never stop
to trouble about whether hes happy or not

LADY CICELY Sometimes he wont even stop to trouble about whether other
people are happy or not

BRASSBOUND I dont deny that nothing makes a man so selfish as work
But I was not selfseeking it seemed to me that I had put justice above
self I tell you life meant something to me then Do you see that dirty
little bundle of scraps of paper

LADY CICELY What are they

BRASSBOUND Accounts cut out of newspapers Speeches made by my uncle
at charitable dinners or sentencing men to deathpious highminded
speeches by a man who was to me a thief and a murderer To my mind they
were more weighty more momentous better revelations of the wickedness
of law and respectability than the book of the prophet Amos What are
they now He quietly tears the newspaper cuttings into little fragments
and throws them away looking fixedly at her meanwhile

LADY CICELY Well thats a comfort at all events

BRASSBOUND Yes but its a part of my life gone YOUR doing remember
What have I left See here He take up the letters the letters
my uncle wrote to my mother with her comments on their cold drawn
insolence their treachery and cruelty And the piteous letters she
wrote to him later on returned unopened Must they go too

LADY CICELY uneasily I cant ask you to destroy your mothers
letters

BRASSBOUND Why not now that you have taken the meaning out of them
He tears them Is that a comfort too

LADY CICELY Its a little sad but perhaps it is best so

BRASSBOUND That leaves one relic her portrait He plucks the
photograph out of its cheap case

LADY CICELY with vivid curiosity Oh let me see He hands it to
her Before she can control herself her expression changes to one of
unmistakable disappointment and repulsion

BRASSBOUND with a single sardonic cachinnation Ha You expected
something better than that Well youre right Her face does not look
well opposite yours

LADY CICELY distressed I said nothing

BRASSBOUND What could you say He takes back the portrait she
relinquishes it without a word He looks at it shakes his head and
takes it quietly between his finger and thumb to tear it

LADY CICELY staying his hand Oh not your mothers picture

BRASSBOUND If that were your picture would you like your son to keep
it for younger and better women to see

LADY CICELY releasing his hand Oh you are dreadful Tear it tear
it She covers her eyes for a moment to shut out the sight

BRASSBOUND tearing it quietly You killed her for me that day in the
castle and I am better without her He throws away the fragments Now
everything is gone You have taken the old meaning out of my life but
you have put no new meaning into it I can see that you have some clue
to the world that makes all its difficulties easy for you but Im not
clever enough to seize it Youve lamed me by showing me that I take
life the wrong way when Im left to myself

LADY CICELY Oh no Why do you say that

BRASSBOUND What else can I say See what Ive done My uncle is no
worse a man than myselfbetter most likely for he has a better head
and a higher place Well I took him for a villain out of a storybook
My mother would have opened anybody elses eyes she shut mine Im
a stupider man than Brandyfaced Jack even for he got his romantic
nonsense out of his penny numbers and such like trash but I got just
the same nonsense out of life and experience Shaking his head It was
vulgarVULGAR I see that now for youve opened my eyes to the past
but what good is that for the future What am I to do Where am I to go

LADY CICELY Its quite simple Do whatever you like Thats what I
always do

BRASSBOUND That answer is no good to me What I like is to have
something to do and I have nothing You might as well talk like the
missionary and tell me to do my duty

LADY CICELY quickly Oh no thank you Ive had quite enough of your
duty and Howards duty Where would you both be now if Id let you do
it

BRASSBOUND Wed have been somewhere at all events It seems to me that
now I am nowhere

LADY CICELY But arent you coming back to England with us

BRASSBOUND What for

LADY CICELY Why to make the most of your opportunities

BRASSBOUND What opportunities

LADY CICELY Dont you understand that when you are the nephew of a
great bigwig and have influential connexions and good friends among
them lots of things can be done for you that are never done for
ordinary ship captains

BRASSBOUND Ah but Im not an aristocrat you see And like most poor
men Im proud I dont like being patronized

LADY CICELY What is the use of saying that In my world which is now
your worldOUR worldgetting patronage is the whole art of life A man
cant have a career without it

BRASSBOUND In my world a man can navigate a ship and get his living by
it

LADY CICELY Oh I see youre one of the Idealiststhe Impossibilists
We have them too occasionally in our world Theres only one thing to
be done with them

BRASSBOUND Whats that

LADY CICELY Marry them straight off to some girl with enough money for
them and plenty of sentiment Thats their fate

BRASSBOUND Youve spoiled even that chance for me Do you think I could
look at any ordinary woman after you You seem to be able to make me
do pretty well what you like but you cant make me marry anybody but
yourself

LADY CICELY Do you know Captain Paquito that Ive married no less
than seventeen men Brassbound stares to other women And they all
opened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me

BRASSBOUND Then I shall be the first man you ever found to stand to his
word

LADY CICELY part pleased part amused part sympathetic Do you really
want a wife

BRASSBOUND I want a commander Dont undervalue me I am a good man
when I have a good leader I have courage I have determination Im not
a drinker I can command a schooner and a shore party if I cant command
a ship or an army When work is put upon me I turn neither to save my
life nor to fill my pocket Gordon trusted me and he never regretted
it If you trust me you shant regret it All the same theres
something wanting in me I suppose Im stupid

LADY CICELY Oh youre not stupid

BRASSBOUND Yes I am Since you saw me for the first time in that
garden youve heard me say nothing clever And Ive heard you say
nothing that didnt make me laugh or make me feel friendly as well
as telling me what to think and what to do Thats what I mean by real
cleverness Well I havent got it I can give an order when I know what
order to give I can make men obey it willing or unwilling But Im
stupid I tell you stupid When theres no Gordon to command me I
cant think of what to do Left to myself Ive become half a brigand
I can kick that little gutterscrub Drinkwater but I find myself doing
what he puts into my head because I cant think of anything else When
you came I took your orders as naturally as I took Gordons though
I little thought my next commander would be a woman I want to take
service under you And theres no way in which that can be done except
marrying you Will you let me do it

LADY CICELY Im afraid you dont quite know how odd a match it would be
for me according to the ideas of English society

BRASSBOUND I care nothing about English society let it mind its own
business

LADY CICELY rising a little alarmed Captain Paquito I am not in
love with you

BRASSBOUND also rising with his gaze still steadfastly on her I
didnt suppose you were the commander is not usually in love with his
subordinate

LADY CICELY Nor the subordinate with the commander

BRASSBOUND assenting firmly Nor the subordinate with the commander

LADY CICELY learning for the first time in her life what terror is
as she finds that he is unconsciously mesmerizing her Oh you are
dangerous

BRASSBOUND Come are you in love with anybody else Thats the
question

LADY CICELY shaking her head I have never been in love with any real
person and I never shall How could I manage people if I had that mad
little bit of self left in me Thats my secret

BRASSBOUND Then throw away the last bit of self Marry me

LADY CICELY vainly struggling to recall her wandering will Must I

BRASSBOUND There is no must You CAN I ask you to My fate depends on
it

LADY CICELY Its frightful for I dont mean todont wish to

BRASSBOUND But you will

LADY CICELY quite lost slowly stretches out her hand to give it to
him I Gunfire from the Thanksgiving His eyes dilate It wakes her
from her trance What is that

BRASSBOUND It is farewell Rescue for yousafety freedom You were
made to be something better than the wife of Black Paquito He kneels
and takes her hands You can do no more for me now I have blundered
somehow on the secret of command at last he kisses her hands thanks
for that and for a mans power and purpose restored and righted And
farewell farewell farewell

LADY CICELY in a strange ecstasy holding his hands as he rises Oh
farewell With my hearts deepest feeling farewell farewell

BRASSBOUND With my hearts noblest honor and triumph farewell He
turns and flies

LADY CICELY How glorious how glorious And what an escape

CURTAIN



NOTES TO CAPTAIN BRASSBOUNDS CONVERSION

SOURCES OF THE PLAY

I claim as a notable merit in the authorship of this play that I have
been intelligent enough to steal its scenery its surroundings its
atmosphere its geography its knowledge of the east its fascinating
Cadis and Kearneys and Sheikhs and mud castles from an excellent book of
philosophic travel and vivid adventure entitled MogrebelAcksa Morocco
the Most Holy by Cunninghame Graham My own first hand knowledge of
Morocco is based on a mornings walk through Tangier and a cursory
observation of the coast through a binocular from the deck of an Orient
steamer both later in date than the writing of the play

Cunninghame Graham is the hero of his own book but I have not made
him the hero of my play because so incredible a personage must have
destroyed its likelihoodsuch as it is There are moments when I do
not myself believe in his existence And yet he must be real for I have
seen him with these eyes and I am one of the few men living who can
decipher the curious alphabet in which he writes his private letters
The man is on public record too The battle of Trafalgar Square in
which he personally and bodily assailed civilization as represented by
the concentrated military and constabular forces of the capital of the
world can scarcely be forgotten by the more discreet spectators
of whom I was one On that occasion civilization qualitatively his
inferior was quantitatively so hugely in excess of him that it put him
in prison but had not sense enough to keep him there Yet his getting
out of prison was as nothing compared to his getting into the House of
Commons How he did it I know not but the thing certainly happened
somehow That he made pregnant utterances as a legislator may be taken
as proved by the keen philosophy of the travels and tales he has since
tossed to us but the House strong in stupidity did not understand
him until in an inspired moment he voiced a universal impulse by bluntly
damning its hypocrisy Of all the eloquence of that silly parliament
there remains only one single damn It has survived the front bench
speeches of the eighties as the word of Cervantes survives the
oraculations of the Dons and Deys who put him too in prison The
shocked House demanded that he should withdraw his cruel word I never
withdraw said he and I promptly stole the potent phrase for the sake
of its perfect style and used it as a cockade for the Bulgarian hero
of Arms and the Man The theft prospered and I naturally take the first
opportunity of repeating it In what other Lepantos besides Trafalgar
Square Cunninghame Graham has fought I cannot tell He is a fascinating
mystery to a sedentary person like myself The horse a dangerous
animal whom when I cannot avoid I propitiate with apples and sugar he
bestrides and dominates fearlessly yet with a true republican sense of
the rights of the fourlegged fellowcreature whose martyrdom and mans
shame therein he has told most powerfully in his Calvary a tale with
an edge that will cut the soft cruel hearts and strike fire from the
hard kind ones He handles the other lethal weapons as familiarly as the
pen medieval sword and modern Mauser are to him as umbrellas and kodaks
are to me His tales of adventure have the true Cervantes touch of
the man who has been thereso refreshingly different from the scenes
imagined by bloodyminded clerks who escape from their servitude into
literature to tell us how men and cities are conceived in the counting
house and the volunteer corps He is I understand a Spanish hidalgo
hence the superbity of his portrait by Lavery Velasquez being no
longer available He is I know a Scotch laird How he contrives to be
authentically the two things at the same time is no more intelligible to
me than the fact that everything that has ever happened to him seems to
have happened in Paraguay or Texas instead of in Spain or Scotland He
is I regret to add an impenitent and unashamed dandy such boots such
a hat would have dazzled DOrsay himself With that hat he once saluted
me in Regent St when I was walking with my mother Her interest was
instantly kindled and the following conversation ensued Who is that
Cunninghame Graham Nonsense Cunninghame Graham is one of your
Socialists that man is a gentleman This is the punishment of vanity
a fault I have myself always avoided as I find conceit less troublesome
and much less expensive Later on somebody told him of Tarudant a city
in Morocco in which no Christian had ever set foot Concluding at once
that it must be an exceptionally desirable place to live in he took
ship and horse changed the hat for a turban and made straight for the
sacred city via Mogador How he fared and how he fell into the hands
of the Cadi of Kintafi who rightly held that there was more danger to
Islam in one Cunninghame Graham than in a thousand Christians may be
learnt from his account of it in MogrebelAcksa without which Captain
Brassbounds Conversion would never have been written

I am equally guiltless of any exercise of invention concerning the story
of the West Indian estate which so very nearly serves as a peg to hang
Captain Brassbound To Mr Frederick Jackson of Hindhead who against
all his principles encourages and abets me in my career as a dramatist
I owe my knowledge of those main facts of the case which became public
through an attempt to make the House of Commons act on them This being
so I must add that the character of Captain Brassbounds mother like
the recovery of the estate by the next heir is an interpolation of my
own It is not however an invention One of the evils of the pretence
that our institutions represent abstract principles of justice
instead of being mere social scaffolding is that persons of a certain
temperament take the pretence seriously and when the law is on the side
of injustice will not accept the situation and are driven mad by their
vain struggle against it Dickens has drawn the type in his Man from
Shropshire in Bleak House Most public men and all lawyers have been
appealed to by victims of this sense of injusticethe most unhelpable
of afflictions in a society like ours

ENGLISH AND AMERICAN DIALECTS

The fact that English is spelt conventionally and not phonetically makes
the art of recording speech almost impossible What is more it places
the modern dramatist who writes for America as well as England in
a most trying position Take for example my American captain and my
English lady I have spelt the word conduce as uttered by the
American captain as cawndooce to suggest very roughly the American
pronunciation to English readers Then why not spell the same word
when uttered by Lady Cicely as kerndewce to suggest the English
pronunciation to American readers To this I have absolutely no defence
I can only plead that an author who lives in England necessarily loses
his consciousness of the peculiarities of English speech and sharpens
his consciousness of the points in which American speech differs from
it so that it is more convenient to leave English peculiarities to be
recorded by American authors I must however most vehemently disclaim
any intention of suggesting that English pronunciation is authoritative
and correct My own tongue is neither American English nor English
English but Irish English so I am as nearly impartial in the matter
as it is in human nature to be Besides there is no standard English
pronunciation any more than there is an American one in England every
county has its catchwords just as no doubt every state in the Union
has I cannot believe that the pioneer American for example can spare
time to learn that last refinement of modern speech the exquisite
diphthong a farfetched combination of the French eu and the English e
with which a New Yorker pronounces such words as world bird c I have
spent months without success in trying to achieve glibness with it

To Felix Drinkwater also I owe some apology for implying that all his
vowel pronunciations are unfashionable They are very far from being so
As far as my social experience goes and I have kept very mixed company
there is no class in English society in which a good deal of Drinkwater
pronunciation does not pass unchallenged save by the expert phonetician
This is no mere rash and ignorant jibe of my own at the expense of my
English neighbors Academic authority in the matter of English speech is
represented at present by Mr Henry Sweet of the University of Oxford
whose Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Engliach translated into his
native language for the use of British islanders as a Primer of Spoken
English is the most accessible standard work on the subject In such
words as plum come humbug up gum etc Mr Sweets evidence is
conclusive Ladies and gentlemen in Southern England pronounce them as
plam kam hambag ap gan etc exactly as Felix Drinkwater does I
could not claim Mr Sweets authority if I dared to whisper that such
coster English as the rather pretty dahn tahn for down town or the
decidedly ugly cowcow for cocoa is current in very polite circles The
entire nation costers and all would undoubtedly repudiate any such
pronunciation as vulgar All the same if I were to attempt to represent
current smart cockney speech as I have attempted to represent
Drinkwaters without the niceties of Mr Sweets Romic alphabets I
am afraid I should often have to write dahn tahn and cowcow as being
at least nearer to the actual sound than down town and cocoa And this
would give such offence that I should have to leave the country for
nothing annoys a native speaker of English more than a faithful setting
down in phonetic spelling of the sounds he utters He imagines that
a departure from conventional spelling indicates a departure from the
correct standard English of good society Alas this correct standard
English of good society is unknown to phoneticians It is only one of
the many figments that bewilder our poor snobbish brains No such thing
exists but what does that matter to people trained from infancy to make
a point of honor of belief in abstractions and incredibilities And so I
am compelled to hide Lady Cicelys speech under the veil of conventional
orthography

I need not shield Drinkwater because he will never read my book So
I have taken the liberty of making a special example of him as far as
that can be done without a phonetic alphabet for the benefit of the
mass of readers outside London who still form their notions of cockney
dialect on Sam Weller When I came to London in 1876 the Sam Weller
dialect had passed away so completely that I should have given it up as
a literary fiction if I had not discovered it surviving in a Middlesex
village and heard of it from an Essex one Some time in the eighties
the late Andrew Tuer called attention in the Pall Mall Gazette to
several peculiarities of modern cockney and to the obsolescence of the
Dickens dialect that was still being copied from book to book by authors
who never dreamt of using their ears much less of training them to
listen Then came Mr Ansteys cockney dialogues in Punch a great
advance and Mr Chevaliers coster songs and patter The Tompkins
verses contributed by Mr Barry Pain to the London Daily Chronicle have
also done something to bring the literary convention for cockney English
up to date But Tompkins sometimes perpetrates horrible solecisms He
will pronounce face as fits accurately enough but he will rhyme it
quite impossibly to nice which Tompkins would pronounce as newts for
example Mawl Enn Rowd for Mile End Road This aw for i which I have
made Drinkwater use is the latest stage of the old diphthongal oi
which Mr Chevalier still uses Irish Scotch and north country readers
must remember that Drinkwaters rs are absolutely unpronounced when they
follow a vowel though they modify the vowel very considerably Thus
luggage is pronounced by him as laggige but turn is not pronounced as
tern but as teun with the eu sounded as in French The London r seems
thoroughly understood in America with the result however that the use
of the r by Artemus Ward and other American dialect writers causes Irish
people to misread them grotesquely I once saw the pronunciation of
malheureux represented in a cockney handbook by malerrerr not at
all a bad makeshift to instruct a Londoner but out of the question
elsewhere in the British Isles In America representations of English
speech dwell too derisively on the dropped or interpolated h American
writers have apparently not noticed the fact that the south English h
is not the same as the neverdropped Irish and American h and that to
ridicule an Englishman for dropping it is as absurd as to ridicule the
whole French and Italian nation for doing the same The American
h helped out by a general agreement to pronounce wh as hw is
tempestuously audible and cannot be dropped without being immediately
missed The London h is so comparatively quiet at all times and so
completely inaudible in wh that it probably fell out of use simply by
escaping the ears of children learning to speak However that may be it
is kept alive only by the literate classes who are reminded constantly
of its existence by seeing it on paper

Roughly speaking I should say that in England he who bothers about
his hs is a fool and he who ridicules a dropped h a snob As to the
interpolated h my experience as a London vestryman has convinced me
that it is often effective as a means of emphasis and that the London
language would be poorer without it The objection to it is no more
respectable than the objection of a street boy to a black man or to a
lady in knickerbockers

I have made only the most perfunctory attempt to represent the dialect
of the missionary There is no literary notation for the grave music of
good Scotch

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
