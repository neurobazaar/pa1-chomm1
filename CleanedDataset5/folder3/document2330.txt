RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT CHINA



CHAPTER I  THE ANCIENT FAITH

Philosophical Theory of the UniverseThe problem of the universe has
never offered the slightest difficulty to Chinese philosophers Before
the beginning of all things there was Nothing In the lapse of ages
Nothing coalesced into Unity the Great Monad After more ages the
Great Monad separated into Duality the Male and Female Principles in
nature and then by a process of biogenesis the visible universe was
produced

Popular CosmogenyAn addition however to this simple system had to
be made in deference to and on a plane with the intelligence of the
masses According to this the Male and Female Principles were each
subdivided into Greater and Lesser and then from the interaction of
these four agencies a being named Pan Ku came into existence He
seems to have come into life endowed with perfect knowledge and his
function was to set the economy of the universe in order He is often
depicted as wielding a huge adze and engaged in constructing the world
With his death the details of creation began His breath became the
wind his voice the thunder his left eye the sun his right eye the
moon his blood flowed in rivers his hair grew into trees and plants
his flesh became the soil his sweat descended as rain while the
parasites which infested his body were the origin of the human race

Recognition and Worship of SpiritsEarly Chinese writers tell us that
Fu Hsi BC 29532838 was the first Emperor to organize sacrifices to
and worship of spirits In this he was followed by the Yellow Emperor
BC 26982598 who built a temple for the worship of God in which
incense was used and first sacrificed to the Mountains and Rivers He
is also said to have established the worship of the sun moon and five
planets and to have elaborated the ceremonial of ancestral worship

God the Father Earth the MotherThe Yellow Emperor was followed by
the Emperor Shao Hao BC 25982514 who instituted the music of the
Great Abyss in order to bring spirits and men into harmony Then
came the Emperor Chuan Hsu BC 25142436 of whom it is said that he
appointed an officer to preside over the worship of God and Earth
in order to form a link between the spirits and man and also caused
music to be played for the enjoyment of God Music by the way is said
to have been introduced into worship in imitation of thunder and was
therefore supposed to be pleasing to the Almighty After him followed
the Emperor Ti Ku BC 24362366 who dabbled in astronomy and came
to a knowledge of spiritual beings which he respectfully worshipped
The Emperor Yao BC 23572255 built a temple for the worship of
God and also caused dances to be performed for the enjoyment of God
on occasions of special sacrifice and communication with the spiritual
world After him we reach the Emperor Shun BC 22552205 in whose
favour Yao abdicated

Additional DeitiesBefore however Shun ventured to mount the throne
he consulted the stars in order to find out if the unseen Powers were
favourable to his elevation and on receiving a satisfactory reply he
proceeded to sacrifice to God to the Six Honoured Ones unknown to
the Mountains and Rivers and to Spirits in general    In the second
month of the year he made a tour of inspection eastwards as far as
Mount Tai in modern Shantung where he presented a burnt offering to
God and sacrificed to the Mountains and Rivers

God punishes the wicked and rewards the goodThe Great Yu who drained
the empire and came to the throne in BC 2205 as first Emperor of the
Hsia dynasty followed in the lines of his pious predecessors But the
Emperor Kung Chia BC 18791848 who at first had treated the Spirits
with all due reverence fell into evil ways and was abandoned by God
This was the beginning of the end In BC 1766 Tang the Completer
founder of the Shang dynasty set to work to overthrow Chieh Kuei the
last ruler of the Hsia dynasty He began by sacrificing to Almighty
God and asked for a blessing on his undertaking And in his subsequent
proclamation to the empire he spoke of that God as follows God has
given to every man a conscience and if all men acted in accordance with
its dictates they would not stray from the right path    The way of
God is to bless the good and punish the bad He has sent down calamities
on the House of Hsia to make manifest its crimes

God manifests displeasureIn BC 1637 the Emperor Tai Mou succeeded
His reign was marked by the supernatural appearance in the palace of two
mulberrytrees which in a single night grew to such a size that
they could hardly be spanned by two hands The Emperor was terrified
whereupon a Minister said No prodigy is a match for virtue Your
Majestys government is no doubt at fault and some reform of conduct
is necessary Accordingly the Emperor began to act more circumspectly
after which the mulberrytrees soon withered and died

Revelation in a dreamThe Emperor Wu Ting BC 13241264 began his
reign by not speaking for three years leaving all State affairs to be
decided by his Prime Minister while he himself gained experience
Later on the features of a sage were revealed to him in a dream and
on waking he caused a portrait of the apparition to be prepared and
circulated throughout the empire The sage was found and for a long
time aided the Emperor in the right administration of government On the
occasion of a sacrifice a pheasant perched upon the handle of the great
sacrificial tripod and crowed at which the Emperor was much alarmed
Be not afraid cried a Minister but begin by reforming your
government God looks down upon mortals and in accordance with their
deserts grants them many years or few God does not shorten mens
lives they do that themselves Some are wanting in virtue and will not
acknowledge their transgressions only when God chastens them do they
cry What are we to do

Anthropomorphism and FetishismOne of the last Emperors of the Shang
dynasty Wu I who reigned BC 11981194 even went so far as to make
an image in human form which he called God With this image he used
to play at dice causing some one to throw for the image and if God
lost he would overwhelm the image with insult He also made a bag of
leather which he filled with blood and hung up Then he would shoot at
it saying that he was shooting God By and by when he was out hunting
he was struck down by a violent thunderclap and killed

God indignantFinally when the Shang dynasty sank into the lowest
depths of moral abasement King Wu who charged himself with its
overthrow and who subsequently became the first sovereign of the Chou
dynasty offered sacrifices to Almighty God and also to Mother Earth
The King of Shang he said in his address to the high officers who
collected around him does not reverence God above and inflicts
calamities on the people below Almighty God is moved with indignation
On the day of the final battle he declared that he was acting in the
matter of punishment merely as the instrument of God and after his
great victory and the establishment of his own line it was to God that
he rendered thanks

No Devil No HellIn this primitive monotheism of which only scanty
but no doubt genuine records remain no place was found for any being
such as the Buddhist Mara or the Devil of the Old and New Testaments
God inflicted His own punishments by visiting calamities on mankind
just as He bestowed His own rewards by sending bounteous harvests in due
season Evil spirits were a later invention and their operations were
even then confined chiefly to tearing peoples hearts out and so forth
for their own particular pleasure we certainly meet no cases of evil
spirits wishing to undermine mans allegiance to God or desiring to
make people wicked in order to secure their everlasting punishment The
vision of Purgatory with all its horrid tortures was introduced into
China by Buddhism and was subsequently annexed by the Taoists some
time between the third and sixth centuries AD

Chinese Terms for GodBefore passing to the firmer ground
historically speaking of the Chou dynasty it may be as well to state
here that there are two terms in ancient Chinese literature which seem
to be used indiscriminately for God One is _Tien_ which has come
to include the material heavens the sky and the other is _Shang Ti_
which has come to include the spirits of deceased Emperors These two
terms appear simultaneously so to speak in the earliest documents
which have come down to us dating back to something like the twentieth
century before Christ Priority however belongs beyond all doubt to
_Tien_ which it would have been more natural to find meaning first
the visible heavens and secondly the Deity whose existence beyond the
sky would be inferred from such phenomena as lightning thunder wind
and rain But the process appears to have been the other way so far at
any rate as the written language is concerned The Chinese script when
it first came into existence was purely pictorial and confined to
visible objects which were comparatively easy to depict There does not
seem to have been any attempt to draw a picture of the sky On the other
hand the character _Tien_ was just such a representation of a human
being as would be expected from the hand of a prehistoric artist
and under this unmistakable shape the character appears on bells and
tripods as seen in collections of inscriptions so late as the sixth
and seventh centuries BC after which the head is flattered to a line
and the arms are raised until they form another line parallel to that of
the head

Distinction between Tien and Shang TiThe term _Shang Ti_ means
literally Supreme Ruler It is not quite so vague as _Tien_ which
seems to be more of an abstraction while _Shang Ti_ is a genuinely
personal God Reference to _Tien_ is usually associated with fate or
destiny calamities blessings prayers for help etc The commandments
of _Tien_ are hard to obey He is compassionate to be feared unjust
and cruel _Shang Ti_ lives in heaven walks leaves tracks on the
ground enjoys the sweet savour of sacrifice approves or disapproves
of conduct deals with rewards and punishments in a more particular way
and comes more actually into touch with the human race

Thus _Shang Ti_ would be the God who walked in the garden in the cool of
the day the God who smelled the sweet savour of Noahs sacrifice and
the God who allowed Moses to see His back _Tien_ would be the God of
Gods of the Psalms whose mercy endureth for ever the everlasting God
of Isaiah who fainteth not neither is weary

Roman Catholic DissensionsThese two in fact were the very terms
favoured by the early Jesuit missionaries to China though not with the
limitations above suggested as fit the proper renderings for God and
of the two terms the great Manchu Emperor Kang Hsi chose _Tien_ It
has been thought that the conversion of China to Christianity under the
guiding influence of the Jesuits would soon have become an accomplished
fact but for the ignorant opposition to the use of these terms by the
Franciscans and Dominicans who referred this question among others to
the Pope In 1704 Clement XI published a bull declaring that the Chinese
equivalent for God was _Tien Chu_Lord of Heaven and such it has
continued to be ever since so far as the Roman Catholic church is
concerned in spite of the fact that _Tien Chu_ was a name given at the
close of the third century BC to one of the Eight Spirits

The two Terms are OneThat the two terms refer in Chinese thought to
one and the same Being though possibly with differing attributes even
down to modern times may be seen from the account of a dream by the
Emperor Yung Lo AD 14031425 in which His Majesty relates that an
angel appeared to him with a message from _Shang Ti_ upon which the
Emperor remarked Is not this a command from _Tien_ A comparison
might perhaps be instituted with the use of God and Jehovah in
the Bible At the same time it must be noted that this view was not
suggested by the Emperor Kang Hsi who fixed upon _Tien_ as the
appropriate term It is probable that vigorous Confucianist as he was
he was anxious to appear on the side rather of an abstract than of
a personal Deity and that he was repelled by the overwrought
anthropomorphism of the Christian God His conversion was said to have
been very near at times we read however that when hard pressed by
the missionaries to accept baptism he always excused himself by saying
that he worshipped the same God as the Christians

God in the OdesThe Chou dynasty lasted from BC 1122 to BC
255 It was Chinas feudal age when the empire then included between
latitude 3440 and longitude 109118 was split up into a number of
vassal States which owned allegiance to a suzerain State And it is to
the earlier centuries of the Chou dynasty that must be attributed the
composition of a large number of ballads of various kinds ultimately
collected and edited by Confucius and now known as the _Odes_ From
these _Odes_ it is abundantly clear that the Chinese people continued
to hold more clearly and more firmly than ever a deepseated belief in
the existence of an anthropomorphic and personal God whose one care was
the welfare of the human race

 There is Almighty God
 Does He hate any one

He reigns in gloryThe soul of King Wen father of the King Wu below
and posthumously raised by his son to royal rank is represented as
enjoying happiness in a state beyond the grave

 King Wen is on high
 In glory in heaven
 His comings and his goings
 Are to and from the presence of God

He is a SpiritSometimes in the _Odes_ there is a hint that God in
spite of His anthropomorphic semblance is a spirit

 The doings of God
 Have neither sound nor smell

Spiritual BeingsSpirits were certainly supposed to move freely among
mortals

 Do not say This place is not public
 No one can see me here
 The approaches of spiritual Beings
 Cannot be calculated beforehand
 But on no account should they be ignored

The God of BattleIn the hour of battle the God of ancient China was
as much a participator in the fight as the God of Israel in the Old
Testament

 God is on your side

was the cry which stimulated King Wu to break down the opposing ranks
of Shang To King Wus father and others direct communications had
previously been made from heaven with a view to the regeneration of the
empire

 The dynasties of Hsia and Shang
 Had not satisfied God with their government
 So throughout the various States
 He sought and considered
 For a State on which He might confer the rule

 God said to King Wen
 I am pleased with your conspicuous virtue
 Without noise and without display
 Without heat and without change
 Without consciousness of effort
 Following the pattern of God

 God said to King Wen
 Take measures against hostile States
 Along with your brethren
 Get ready your grapplingirons
 And your engines of assault
 To attack the walls of Tsung

God sends FamineThe _Ode_ from which the following extract is taken
carries us back to the ninth century BC at the time of a prolonged
and disastrous drought

 Glorious was the Milky Way
 Revolving brightly in the sky
 When the king said Alas
 What crime have my people committed now
 That God sends down death and disorder
 And famine comes upon us again
 There is no spirit to whom I have not sacrificed
 There is no victim that I have grudged
 Our sacrificial symbols are all used up
 How is it that I am not heard

The Confucian CriterionThe keystone of the Confucian philosophy that
man is born good will be found in the following lines

 How mighty is God
 How clothed in majesty is God
 And how unsearchable are His judgments
 God gives birth to the people
 But their natures are not constant
 All have the same beginning
 But few have the same end

God however is not held responsible for the sufferings of mankind
King Wen in an address to the last tyrant of the House of Shang says
plainly

 It is not God who has caused this evil time
 But it is you who have strayed from the old paths

The Associate of GodWorshipped on certain occasions as the Associate
of God and often summoned to aid in hours of distress or danger was a
personage known as Hou Chi said to have been the original ancestor
of the House of Chou His story sufficiently told in the _Odes_ is
curious for several reasons and especially for an instance in Chinese
literature which in the absence of any known husband comes near
suggesting the muchvexed question of parthenogenesis

 She who first gave birth to our people
 Was the lady Chiang Yuan
 How did she give birth to them
 She offered up a sacrifice
 That she might not be childless
 Then she trod in a footprint of Gods and conceived
 The great and blessed one
 Pregnant with a new birth to be
 And brought forth and nourished
 Him who was Hou Chi

 When she had fulfilled her months
 Her firstborn came forth like a lamb
 There was no bursting no rending
 No injury no hurt
 In order to emphasise his divinity
 Did not God give her comfort
 Had He not accepted her sacrifice
 So that thus easily she brought forth her son

 He was exposed in a narrow lane
 But sheep and oxen protected and suckled him
 He was exposed in a wide forest
 But woodcutters found him
 He was exposed on cold ice
 But birds covered him with their wings

Apotheosis of Hou ChiAnd so he grew to mans estate and taught
the people husbandry with a success that has never been rivalled
Consequently he was deified and during several centuries of the Chou
dynasty was united in worship with God

 O wise Hou Chi
 Fit Associate of our God
 Founder of our race
 There is none greater than thou
 Thou gavest us wheat and barley
 Which God appointed for our nourishment
 And without distinction of territory
 Didst inculcate the virtues over our vast dominions

Other DeitiesDuring the long period covered by the Chou dynasty
various other deities of more or less importance were called into
existence

The patriarchal Emperor Shen Nung BC 28382698 who had taught his
people to till the ground and eat of the fruits of their labour was
deified as the tutelary genius of agriculture

 That my fields are in such good condition
 Is matter of joy to my husbandmen
 With lutes and with drums beating
 We will invoke the Father of Husbandry
 And pray for sweet rain
 To increase the produce of our millet fields
 And to bless my men and their wives

There were also sacrifices to the Father of War whoever he may have
been to the Spirits of Wind Rain and Fire and even to a deity who
watched over the welfare of silkworms Since those days the number of
spiritual beings who receive worship from the Chinese some in one part
of the empire some in another has increased enormously A single
work published in 1640 gives notices of no fewer than eight hundred
divinities

SuperstitionsDuring the period under consideration all kinds of
superstition prevailed among others that of referring to the rainbow
The rainbow was believed by the vulgar to be an emanation from an
enormous oyster away in the great ocean which surrounded the world ie
China Philosophers held it to be the result of undue proportions in the
mixture of the two cosmogonical principles which when properly blended
produce the harmony of nature By both parties it was considered to be
an inauspicious manifestation and merely to point at it would produce a
sore on the hand

Supernatural ManifestationsSeveral events of a supernatural character
are recorded as having taken place under the Chou dynasty In BC 756
one of the feudal Dukes saw a vision of a yellow serpent which descended
from heaven and laid its head on the slope of a mountain The Duke spoke
of this to his astrologer who said It is a manifestation of God
sacrifice to it

In BC 747 another Duke found on a mountain a being in the semblance
of a stone Sacrifices were at once offered and the stone was deified
and received regular worship from that time forward

In BC 659 a third Duke was in a trance for five days when he saw
a vision of God and received from Him instructions as to matters then
pressing For many generations afterwards the story ran that the Duke
had been up to Heaven This became a favourite theme for romancers It
is stated in the biography of a certain Feng Po that one night he saw
the gate of heaven open and beheld exceeding glory within which shone
into his courtyard

The following story is told by Huainan Tzu d BC 122Once when
the Duke of Luyang was at war with the Han State and sunset drew near
while a battle was still fiercely raging the Duke held up his spear and
shook it at the sun which forthwith went back three zodiacal signs

Only the Emperor worships God and EarthFrom the records of this
period we can also see how jealously the worship of God and Earth was
reserved for the Emperor alone

In BC 651 Duke Huan of the Chi State one of the feudal nobles to
be mentioned later on wished to signalise his accession to the post of
doyen or leader of the vassal States by offering the great sacrifices
to God and to Earth He was however dissuaded from this by a wise
Minister who pointed out that only those could perform these ceremonies
who had personally received the Imperial mandate from God

This same Minister is said to be responsible for the following
utterance

Duke Huan asked Kuan Chang saying To what should a prince attach the
highest importance To God replied the Minister at which Duke Huan
gazed upwards to the sky The God I mean continued Kuan Chung is not
the illimitable blue above A true prince makes the people his God

SacrificesMuch has been recorded by the Chinese on the subject
of sacrificemore indeed than can be easily condensed into a small
compass First of all there were the great sacrifices to God and to
Earth at the winter and summer solstices respectively which were
reserved for the Son of Heaven alone Besides what may be called private
sacrifices the Emperor sacrificed also to the four quarters and to the
mountains and rivers of the empire while the feudal nobles sacrificed
each to his own quarter and to the mountains and rivers of his own
domain The victim offered by the Emperor on a blazing pile of wood was
an ox of one colour always a young animal a feudal noble would use any
fatted ox and a petty official a sheep or a pig When sacrificing to
the spirits of the land and of grain the Son of Heaven used a bull a
ram and a boar the feudal nobles only a ram and a boar and the common
people scallions and eggs in spring wheat and fish in summer millet
and a suckingpig in autumn and unhulled rice and a goose in winter
If there was anything infelicitous about the victim intended for God it
was used for Hou Chi The victim intended for God required to be kept in
a clean stall for three months that for Hou Chi simply required to
be perfect in its parts This was the way in which they distinguished
between heavenly and earthly spirits

In primeval times we are told sacrifices consisted of meat and drink
the latter being the mysterious liquid water for which wine was
substituted later on The ancients roasted millet and pieces of pork
they made a hole in the ground and scooped the water from it with their
two hands beating upon an earthen drum with a clay drumstick Thus they
expressed their reverence for spiritual beings

Sacrifices according to the _Book of Rites_ Legges translation
should not be frequently repeated Such frequency is an indication of
importunateness and importunateness is inconsistent with reverence Nor
should they be at distant intervals Such infrequency is indicative
of indifference and indifference leads to forgetting them altogether
Therefore the superior man in harmony with the course of Nature offers
the sacrifices of spring and autumn When he treads on the dew which
has descended as hoarfrost he cannot help a feeling of sadness which
arises in his mind and which cannot be ascribed to the cold In spring
when he treads on the ground wet with the rains and dews that have
fallen heavily he cannot avoid being moved by a feeling as if he were
seeing his departed friends We meet the approach of our friends with
music and escort them away with sadness and hence at the sacrifice in
spring we use music but not at the sacrifice in autumn

Sacrifice is not a thing coming to a man from without it issues from
within him and has its birth in his heart When the heart is deeply
moved expression is given to it by ceremonies and hence only men
of ability and virtue can give complete exhibition to the idea of
sacrifice It was in this sense that Confucius warned his followers not
to sacrifice to spirits which did not belong to them ie to other than
those of their own immediate ancestors To do otherwise would raise a
suspicion of ulterior motives

Ancestral WorshipFor the purpose of ancestral worship which had been
practised from the earliest ages the Emperor had seven shrines each
with its altar representing various forefathers and at all of these a
sacrifice was offered every month Feudal nobles could have only five
sets of these and the various officials three or fewer on a descending
scale in proportion to their rank Petty officers and the people
generally had no ancestral shrine but worshipped the shades of their
forefathers as best they could in their houses and cottages

For three days before sacrificing to ancestors a strict vigil and
purification was maintained and by the end of that time from sheer
concentration of thought the mourner was able to see the spirits of
the departed and at the sacrifice next day seemed to hear their very
movements and even the murmur of their sighs

The object of the ceremony was to bring down the spirits from above
together with the shades of ancestors and thus to secure the blessing
of God at the same time to please the souls of the departed and to
create a link between the living and the dead

The object in sacrifices is not to pray the time should not be
hastened on a great apparatus is not required ornamental details are
not to be approved the victims need not be fat and large cf Horace
Od III 23 _Immunis aram_ etc a profusion of the other offerings
is not to be admired There must however be no parsimony A high
official well able to afford better things was justly blamed for
having sacrificed to the manes of his father a suckingpig which did not
fill the dish

Religious DancesThe various dances displayed the gravity of the
performers but did not awaken the emotion of delight The ancestral
temple produced the impression of majesty but did not dispose one to
rest on it Its vessels might be employed but could not be conveniently
used for any other purpose The idea which leads to intercourse with
spiritual Beings is not interchangeable with that which finds its
realisation in rest and pleasure

PriestcraftFrom the ceremonial of ancestor worship the thin end of
the wedge of priestcraft was rigorously excluded For the words of
prayer and blessing and those of benediction to be kept hidden away by
the officers of prayer of the ancestral temple and by the sorcerers and
recorders is a violation of the rules of propriety This may be called
keeping in a state of darkness

Confucius sums up the value of sacrifices in the following words By
their great sacrificial ceremonies the ancients served God by their
ceremonies in the ancestral temple they worshipped their forefathers He
who should understand the great sacrificial ceremonies and the meaning
of the ceremonies in the ancestral temple would find it as easy to
govern the empire as to look upon the palm of his hand

Filial PietyIntimately connected with ancestral worship is the
practice of filial piety it is in fact on filial piety that ancestral
worship is dependent for its existence In early ages sons sacrificed
to the manes of their parents and ancestors generally in order to
afford some mysterious pleasure to the disembodied spirits There was
then no idea of propitiation of benefits to ensue In later times the
character of the sacrifice underwent a change until a sentiment of _do
ut des_ became the real mainspring of the ceremony Meanwhile Confucius
had complained that the filial piety of his day only meant the support
of parents But argued the Sage we support our dogs and our horses
without reverence what is there to distinguish one from the other He
affirmed that children who would be accounted filial should give their
parents no cause of anxiety beyond such anxiety as might be occasioned
by illhealth Filial piety he said again did not consist in relieving
the parents of toil or in setting before them wine and food it did
consist in serving them while alive according to the established rules
in burying them when dead according to the established rules and in
sacrificing to them after death also according to the established
rules In another passage Confucius declared that filial piety consists
in carrying on the aims of our forefathers which really amounts to
serving the dead as they would have been served if alive

DivinationDivination seems to have been practised in China from
the earliest ages The implements used were the shell of the tortoise
spiritualised by the long life of its occupant and the stalks of a kind
of grass to which also spiritual powers had for some reason or other
been attributed These were the methods we are told by which the
ancient Kings made their people revere spirits obey the law and settle
all their doubts God gave these spiritual boons to mankind and the
sages took advantage of them To explore what is complex to search
out what is hidden to hook up what lies deep and to reach to what is
distant thereby determining the issues for good or ill of all events
under the sky and making all men full of strenuous endeavour there are
no agencies greater than those of the stalks and the tortoise shell

In BC 2224 when the Emperor Shun wished to associate the Great Yu
with him in the government the latter begged that recourse might be
had to divination in order to discover the most suitable among the
Ministers for this exalted position The Emperor refused saying that
his choice had already been confirmed by the body of Ministers The
spirits too have signified their assent the tortoise and grass having
both concurred Divination when fortunate may not be repeated

Sincerity on which Confucius lays such especial stress is closely
associated with success in divination Sincerity is of God cultivation
of sincerity is of man He who is naturally sincere is he who hits his
mark without effort and without thinking apprehends He easily keeps to
the golden mean he is inspired He who cultivates sincerity is he who
chooses what is good and holds fast to it

It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to
foreknow When a State or a family is about to flourish there are sure
to be happy omens and when it is about to perish there are sure to
be unpropitious omens The events portended are set forth by the
divininggrass and the tortoise When calamity or good fortune may be
about to come the evil or the good will be foreknown by the perfectly
sincere man who may therefore be compared with a spirit

The tortoise and the grass have long since disappeared as instruments of
divination which is now carried on by means of lots drawn from a vase
with answers attached by planchette and by the _chiao_ The last
consists of two pieces of wood anciently of stone in the shape of the
two halves of a kidney bean These are thrown into the air before the
altar in a templeBuddhist or Taoist it matters nothingwith
the following results Two convex sides uppermost mean a response
indifferently good two flat sides mean negative and bad one convex
and one flat side mean that the prayer will be granted This form of
divination though widely practised at the present day is by no means
of recent date It was common in the Chu State which was destroyed
BC 300 after four hundred and twenty years of existence



CHAPTER II  CONFUCIANISM

Attitude of ConfuciusUnder the influence of Confucius BC 551479
the old order of things began to undergo a change The Sages attitude
of mind towards religion was one of a benevolent agnosticism as summed
up in his famous utterance Respect the spirits but keep them at a
distance That he fully recognised the existence of a spirit world
though admitting that he knew nothing about it is manifest from the
following remarks of his

How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to
them We look for but do not see them we listen for but do not hear
them yet they enter into all things and there is nothing without them
They cause all the people in the empire to fast and purify themselves
and array themselves in their richest dresses in order to attend at
their sacrifices Then like overflowing water they seem to be over the
heads and on the right and left of their worshippers

He believed that he himself was at any rate to some extent a prophet
of God as witness his remarks when in danger from the people of
Kuang

After the death of King Wen was not wisdom lodged in me If God were
to destroy this wisdom future generations could not possess it So long
as God does not destroy this wisdom what can the people of Kuang do to
me

Again when Confucius cried Alas there is no one that knows me and
a disciple asked what was meant he replied I do not murmur against
God I do not mumble against man My studies lie low and my penetration
lies high But there is God He knows me

We know that Confucius fasted and we know that he sacrificed to the
spirits as though the spirits were present it is even stated that
when a friend sent him a present though it might be a carriage and
horses unless it were flesh which had been used in sacrifice he did
not bow He declared that for a person in mourning food and music were
without flavour and charm and whenever he saw anyone approaching
who was in mourning dress even though younger than himself he
would immediately rise from his seat He believed in destiny he was
superstitious changing colour at a squall or at a clap of thunder and
he even countenanced the ceremonies performed by villagers when driving
out evil spirits from their dwellings He protested against any attempt
to impose on God He said that he who offends against God has none to
whom he can pray and when in an hour of sickness a disciple asked to
be allowed to pray for him he replied My praying has been for a long
time Yet he declined to speak to his disciples of God of spiritual
beings or even of death and a hereafter holding that life and its
problems were alone sufficient to tax the energies of the human race
While not altogether ignoring mans duty towards God he subordinated
it in every way to mans duty towards his neighbour He also did much
towards weakening the personality of God for whom he invariably
used _Tien_ never _Shang Ti_ regarding Him evidently more as
an abstraction than as a living sentient Being with the physical
attributes of man Confucianism is therefore entirely a system of
morality and not a religion

It is also a curious fact that throughout the _Spring and Autumn_ or
Annals of the State of Lu which extend from BC 722 to BC 484 there
is no allusion of any kind to the interposition of God in human affairs
although a variety of natural phenomena are recorded such as have
always been regarded by primitive peoples as the direct acts of an
angered or benevolent Deity Lu was the State in which Confucius was
born and its annals were compiled by the Sage himself and throughout
these Annals the term God is never used except in connection with the
word King where it always has the sense of by the grace of God
and once where the suzerain is spoken of as the Son of God or as we
usually phrase it the Son of Heaven

How to bring rainIn the famous Commentary by Tsochiu Ming on the
_Spring and Autumn_ which imparts a human interest to the bald entries
set against each year of these annals there are several allusions to
the Supreme Being For instance at a time of great drought the Duke of
Lu wished in accordance with custom to burn a witch and a person in
the last stage of consumption the latter being sometimes exposed in the
sun so as to excite the compassion of God who would then cause rain
to fall A Minister vigorously protested against this superstition
pointing out that the proper way to meet a drought would be to reduce
the quantity of food consumed and to practise rigid economy in all
things What have these creatures to do with the matter he asked If
God had wished to put them to death He had better not have given
them life If they can really produce drought to burn them will only
increase the calamity The Duke accordingly desisted and although
there was a famine it is said to have been less severe than usual

In BC 523 there was a comet A Minister said This broomstar sweeps
away the old and brings in the new The doings of God are constantly
attended by such appearances

Under BC 532 we have the record of a stone speaking The Marquis of
Lu enquired of his chief musician if this was a fact and received the
following answer Stones cannot speak Perhaps this one was possessed
by a spirit If not the people must have heard wrong And yet it
is said that when things are done out of season and discontents and
complaints are stirring among the people then speechless things do
speak

Human SacrificesHuman sacrifices appear to have been not altogether
unknown The _Commentary_ tells us that in BC 637 in consequence of
a failure to appear and enter into a covenant the Viscount of Tseng was
immolated by the people of the Chu State to appease the wild tribes
of the east The Minister of War protested In ancient times the six
domestic animals were not offered promiscuously in sacrifice and for
small matters the regular sacrificial animals were not used How then
should we dare to offer up a man Sacrifices are performed for the
benefit of men who thus as it were entertain the spirits But if men
sacrifice men who will enjoy the offering

Again in BC 529 the ruler of the Chu State destroyed the Tsai
State and offered up the heir apparent as a victim An officer said
This is inauspicious If the five sacrificial animals may not be used
promiscuously how much less can a feudal prince be offered up

The custom of burying live persons with the dead was first practised in
China in BC 580 It is said to have been suggested by an earlier
and more harmless custom of placing straw and wooden effigies in the
mausolea of the great When the First Emperor died in BC 210 all
those among his wives who had borne no children were buried alive with
him

Praying for RainFrom another Commentary on the _Spring and Autumn_
by Kuliang Shu fourth century BC we have the following note on
Prayers for Rain which are still offered up on occasions of drought
but now generally through the medium of Taoist and Buddhist priests

Prayers for rain should be offered up in spring and summer only not in
autumn and winter Why not in autumn and winter Perhaps the moisture of
growing things is not then exhausted neither has man reached the limit
of his skill Why in spring and summer Because time is pressing and
mans skill is of no further avail How so Because without rain just
then nothing could be made to grow the crops would fail and famine
ensue But why wait until time is pressing and mans skill of no
further avail Because to pray for rain is the same thing as asking a
favour and the ancients did not lightly ask favours Why so Because
they held it more blessed to give than to receive and as the latter
excludes the former the main object of mans life is taken away How
is praying for rain asking a favour It is a request that God will do
something for us The divine men of old who had any request to make to
God were careful to prefer it in due season At the head of all his high
officers of State the prince would proceed in person to offer up his
prayer He could not ask any one else to go as his proxy

Posthumous Honours for ConfuciusBefore leaving Confucius it is
necessary to add that now for many centuries he has been the central
figure and object of a cult as sincere as ever offered by man to any
being human or divine The ruler of Confucius native State of Lu was
profoundly distressed by the Sages death and is said to have built a
shrine to commemorate his great worth at which sacrifices were offered
at the four seasons By the time however that the Chou dynasty was
drawing to its close third century BC it would be safe to say
that owing to civil war and the great political upheaval generally the
worship of Confucius was altogether discontinued It certainly did not
flourish under the First Emperor see _post_ and was only revived in
BC 195 by the first Emperor of the Han dynasty who visited the grave
of Confucius in Shantung and sacrificed to his spirit a pig a sheep
and an ox Fifty years later a temple was built to Confucius at his
native place and in AD 72 his seventytwo disciples were admitted
to share in the worship music being shortly afterwards added to the
ceremonial Gradually the people came to look upon Confucius as a
god and women used to pray to him for children until the practice was
stopped by Edict in AD 472 In 505 which some consider to be the date
of the first genuine Confucian Temple wooden images of the Sage were
introduced in 1530 these were abolished and inscribed tablets of wood
in use at the present day were substituted In 555 temples were placed
in all prefectural cities and later on in all the important cities
and towns of the empire In the second and eighth months of each
year before dawn sacrifices to Confucius are still celebrated with
considerable solemnity and pomp including music and dances by bands of
either thirtysix or sixtyfour performers

Mencius and ConfucianismMencius who lived BC 372289 and devoted
himself to the task of spreading and consolidating the Confucian
teachings made no attempt to lead back the Chinese people towards their
early beliefs in a personal God and in a spiritual world beyond the ken
of mortals He observes in a general way that those who obey God are
saved while those who rebel against Him perish but his reference is
to this life and not to a future one He also says that those whom God
destines for some great part He first chastens by suffering and
toil But perhaps his most original contribution will be found in the
following paragraph

By exerting his mental powers to the full man comes to understand his
own nature When he understands his own nature he understands God

In all the above instances the term used for God is _Tien_ Only in one
single passage does Mencius use _Shang Ti_Though a man be wicked if
he duly prepares himself by fasting and abstinence and purification by
water he may sacrifice to God

Chu YuanThe statesmanpoet Chu Yuan BC 332295 who drowned
himself in despair at his countrys outlook and whose body is still
searched for annually at the DragonBoat festival frequently alludes to
a Supreme Being

 Almighty God Thou who art impartial
 And dost appoint the virtuous among men as Thy Assistants

One of his poems is entitled God Questions and consists of a number
of questions on various mysteries in the universe The meaning of the
title would be better expressed by Questions put to God but we are
told that such a phrase was impossible on account of the holiness of
God and the irreverence of questioning Him One question was Who has
handed down to us an account of the beginning of all things and how
do we know anything about the time when heaven and earth were without
form Another question was As Nuchi had no husband how could she
bear nine sons The _Commentary_ tells us that Nuchi was a divine
maiden but nothing more seems to be known about her

The following prose passage is taken from Chu Yuans biography

Man came originally from God just as the individual comes from his
parents When his span is at an end he goes back to that from which
he sprang Thus it is that in the hour of bitter trial and exhaustion
there is no man but calls to God just as in his hours of sickness and
sorrow every one of us will turn to his parents

The great sacrifices to God and to Earth as performed by the early
rulers of China had been traditionally associated with Mount Tai in
the modern province of Shantung one of Chinas five sacred mountains
Accordingly in BC 219 the selfstyled First Emperor desirous
of restoring the old custom which had already fallen into desuetude
proceeded to the summit of Mount Tai where he is said to have carried
out his purpose though what actually took place was always kept a
profound secret The literati however whom the First Emperor had
persecuted by forbidding any further study of the Confucian Canon and
burning all the copies he could lay hands on gave out that he had been
prevented from performing the sacrifices by a violent storm of rain
alleging as a reason that he was altogether deficient in the virtue
required for such a ceremony

It may be added that in BC 110 the then reigning Emperor proceeded
to the summit of Mount Tai and performed the great sacrifice to God
following this up by sacrificing to Earth on a hill at the foot of
the mountain At the ceremony he was dressed in yellow robes and was
accompanied by music During the night there was light and a white
cloud hung over the altar The Emperor himself declared that he saw
a dazzling glory and heard a voice speaking to him The truthful
historianthe Herodotus of Chinawho has left an account of these
proceedings accompanied the Emperor on this and other occasions he
was also present at the sacrifices offered before the departure of the
mission and has left it on record that he himself actually heard the
voices of spirits



CHAPTER III  TAOISM

Lao TzuMeanwhile other influences had been helping to divert the
attention of the Chinese people from the simple worship of God and of
the powers of nature The philosophy associated with the name of Lao
Tzu who lived nobody knows whenprobably about BC 600which is
popularly known as Taoism from Tao the omnipresent omnipotent and
unthinkable principle on which it is based operated with Confucianism
though in an opposite direction in dislimning the old faith while
putting nothing satisfactory in its place Confucianism with its
shadowy monotheistic background was at any rate a practical system for
everyday use and it may be said to contain all the great ethical truths
to be found in the teachings of Christ Lao Tzu harped upon a doctrine
of Inaction by virtue of which all things were to be accomplisheda
perpetual accommodation of self to ones surroundings with the minimum
of effort all progress being spontaneous and in the line of least
resistance Such a system was naturally far better fitted for the study
where in fact it has always remained than for use in ordinary life

In one of the few genuine utterances of Lao Tzu which have survived the
wreck of time we find an allusion to a spiritual world Unfortunately
it is impossible to say exactly what the passage means According to Han
Fei died BC 233 who wrote several chapters to elucidate the sayings
of Lao Tzu the following is the correct interpretation

Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish ie do not
overdo it

If the empire is governed according to Tao evil spirits will not be
worshipped as good ones

If evil spirits are not worshipped as good ones good ones will do no
injury Neither will the Sages injure the people Each will not injure
the other And if neither injures the other then there will be mutual
profit

The latter portion is explained by another commentator as follows

Spirits do not hurt the natural If people are natural spirits have
no means of manifesting themselves and if spirits do not manifest
themselves we are not conscious of their existence as such Likewise
if we are not conscious of the existence of spirits as such we must be
equally unconscious of the existence of inspired teachers as such and
to be unconscious of the existence of spirits and of inspired teachers
is the very essence of Tao

Adumbrations of HeracleitusIn the hands of Lao Tzus more immediate
followers Tao became the Absolute the First Cause and finally One in
whose obliterating unity all seemingly opposed conditions of time and
space were indistinguishably blended This One the source of human
life was placed beyond the limits of our visible universe and in order
for human life to return thither at death and to enjoy immortality it
was only necessary to refine away corporeal grossness according to the
doctrines of Lao Tzu Later on this One came to be regarded as a fixed
point of dazzling luminosity in remote ether around which circled for
ever and ever in the supremest glory of motion the souls of those who
had successfully passed through the ordeal of life and who had left the
slough of humanity behind them

The final state is best described by a poet of the ninth century AD

 Like a whirling waterwheel
 Like rolling pearls
 Yet how are these worthy to be named
 They are but illustrations for fools
 There is the mighty axis of Earth
 The neverresting pole of Heaven
 Let us grasp their clue
 And with them be blended in One
 Beyond the bounds of thought
 Circling for ever in the great Void
 An orbit of a thousand years
 Yes this is the key to my theme

Debased TaoismThis view naturally suggested the prolongation of
earthly life by artificial means hence the search for an elixir
carried on through many centuries by degenerate disciples of Taoism But
here we must pass on to consider some of the speculations on God life
death and immortality indulged in by Taoist philosophers and others
who were not fettered as the Confucianists were by traditional
reticence on the subject of spirits and an unseen universe

Spirits must existMo Tzu a philosopher of the fourth and fifth
centuries BC was arguing one day for the existence of spirits with a
disbelieving opponent All you have to do he said is to go into
any village and make enquiries From of old until now the people have
constantly seen and heard spiritual beings how then can you say they do
not exist If they had never seen nor heard them could people say that
they existed Of course replied the disbeliever many people have
seen and heard spirits but is there any instance of a properly verified
appearance Mo Tzu then told a long story of how King Hsuan BC
827781 unjustly put to death a Minister and how the latter had said
to the King If there is no consciousness after death this matter will
be at an end but if there is then within three years you will hear
from me Three years later at a grand durbar the Minister descended
from heaven on a white horse and shot the King dead before the eyes of
all

Traces of MysticismChuang Tzu the famous philosopher of the third
and fourth centuries BC and exponent of the Tao of Lao Tzu has the
following allusions to God of course as seen through Taoist glasses

God is a principle which exists by virtue of its own intrinsicality
and operates spontaneously without selfmanifestation

He who knows what God is and what Man is has attained Knowing what
God is he knows that he himself proceeded therefrom Knowing what Man
is he rests in the knowledge of the known waiting for the knowledge of
the unknown

The ultimate end is God He is manifested in the laws of nature He is
the hidden spring At the beginning of all things He was

Taoism however does not seem to have succeeded altogether any more
than Confucianism in altogether estranging the Chinese people from
their traditions of a God more or less personal whose power was the
real determining factor in human events The great general Hsiang Yu
BC 233202 said to his charioteer at the battle which proved fatal
to his fortunes I have fought no fewer than seventy fights and have
gained dominion over the empire That I am now brought to this pass is
because God has deserted me



CHAPTER IV  MATERIALISM

Yang HsiungYang Hsiung was a philosopher who flourished
BC 53  AD 18 He taught that the nature of man at birth is neither
good nor evil but a mixture of both and that development in either
direction depends wholly upon environment To one who asked about God
he replied What have I to do with God Watch how without doing
anything He does all things To another who said Surely it is God who
fashions and adorns all earthly forms he replied Not so if God in
an earthly sense were to fashion and adorn all things His strength
would not be adequate to the task

Wang ChungWang Chung AD 2797 denies that men after death live
again as spiritual beings on earth Animals he argues do not become
spirits after death why should man alone undergo this change   
That which informs man at birth is vitality and at death this vitality
is extinguished Vitality is produced by the pulsations of the blood
when these cease vitality is extinguished the body decays and becomes
dust How can it become a spirit    When a man dies his soul
ascends to heaven and his bones return _kuei_ to earth therefore he
is spoken of as a disembodied spirit _kuei_ the latter word really
meaning that which has returned    Vitality becomes humanity just
as water becomes ice The ice melts and is water again man dies
and reverts to spirituality    The spirits which people see are
invariably in the form of human beings and that very fact is enough of
itself to prove that these apparitions cannot be the souls of dead men
If a sack is filled with grain it will stand up and is obviously a
sack of grain but if the sack is burst and the grain falls out then it
collapses and disappears from view Now mans soul is enfolded in his
body as grain in a sack When he dies his body decays and his vitality
is dissipated and if when the grain is taken away the sack loses its
form why when the vitality is gone should the body obtain a new shape
in which to appear again in the world    The number of persons who
have died since the world began old middleaged and young must run
into thousands of millions far exceeding the number of persons alive at
the present day If every one of these has become a disembodied spirit
there must be at least one to every yard as we walk along the road and
those who die must now suddenly find themselves face to face with vast
crowds of spirits filling every house and street    People say that
spirits are the souls of dead men That being the case spirits should
always appear naked for surely it is not contended that clothes have
souls as well as men    It can further be shown not only that dead
men never become spirits but also that they are without consciousness
by the fact that before birth they are without consciousness Before
birth man rests in the First Cause when he dies he goes back to the
First Cause The First Cause is vague and without form and mans soul
is there in a state of unconsciousness At death the soul reverts to its
original state how then can it possess consciousness    As a matter
of fact the universe is full of disembodied spirits but these are not
the souls of dead men They are beings only of the mind conjured up
for the most part in sickness when the patient is especially subject to
fear For sickness induces fear of spirits fear of spirits causes the
mind to dwell upon them and thus apparitions are produced

Another writer enlarges on the view that _kuei_ disembodied spirit is
the same as _kuei_ to return At death mans soul returns to heaven
his flesh to earth his blood to water his bloodvessels to marshes
his voice to thunder his motion to the wind his sleep to the sun and
moon his bones to trees his muscles to hills his teeth to stones his
fat to dew his hair to grass while his breath returns to man

Attributes of GodThere was a certain philosopher named Chin Mi
died AD 226 whose services were much required by the King of Wu
who sent an envoy to fetch him The envoy took upon himself to catechise
the philosopher with the following result

You are engaged in study are you not asked the envoy

Any slip of a boy may be that replied Chin why not I

Has God a head said the envoy

He has was the reply

Where is He was the next question

In the West The _Odes_ say

 He gazed fondly on the West

From which it may be inferred that his head was in the West

Has God got ears

God sits on high replied Chin but hears the lowly The _Odes_ say

 The crane cries in the marsh
 And its cry is heard by God

If He had not ears how could He hear it

Has God feet asked the envoy

He has replied Chin The _Odes_ say

 The steps of God are difficult
 This man does not follow them

If He had no feet how could He step

Has God a surname enquired the envoy And if so what is it

He has a surname said Chin and it is Liu

How do you know that rejoined the other

The surname of the Emperor who is the Son of Heaven is Liu replied
Chin and that is how I know it

These answers we are told came as quickly as echo after sound A
writer of the ninth century AD when reverence for the one God of
ancient China had been to a great extent weakened by the multiplication
of inferior deities tells a story how this God whose name was Liu had
been displaced by another God whose name was Chang

The _Hsing ying tsa lu_ has the following story There was once a very
poor scholar who made it his nightly practice to burn incense and pray
to God One evening he heard a voice from above saying God has been
touched by your earnestness and has sent me to ask what you require
I wish replied the scholar for clothes and food coarse if you
will sufficient for my necessities in this life and to be able to
roam free from care among the mountains and streams until I complete
my allotted span that is all All cried the voice amid peals of
laughter from the clouds Why that is the happiness enjoyed by the
spirits in heaven you cant have that Ask rather for wealth and rank

Good and EvilIt has already been stated that the Chinese imagination
has never conceived of an Evil One deliverance from whom might be
secured by prayer The existence of evil in the abstract has however
received some attention

Wei Tao Tzu asked Yu Li Tzu saying Is it true that God loves good and
hates evil

It is replied Yu

In that case rejoined Wei goodness should abound in the Empire
and evil should be scarce Yet among birds kites and falcons outnumber
phoenixes among beasts wolves are many and unicorns are few among
growing plants thorns are many and cereals are few among those who eat
cooked food and stand erect the wicked are many and the virtuous are
few and in none of these cases can you say that the latter are evil and
the former good Can it be possible that what man regards as evil God
regards as good and _vice versa_ Is it that God is unable to determine
the characteristics of each and lets each follow its own bent and
develop good or evil accordingly If He allows good men to be put upon
and evil men to be a source of fear is not this to admit that God has
His likes and dislikes From of old until now times of misgovernment
have always exceeded times of right government and when men of
principle have contended with the ignoble the latter have usually won
Where then is Gods love of good and hatred of evil

Yu Li Tzu had no answer to make

The _Tan yen tsa lu_ says If the people are contented and happy God
is at peace in His mind When God is at peace in His mind the two great
motive Powers act in harmony

Where is GodThe _Pi chou_ says The empyrean above you is not God
it is but His outward manifestation That which remains ever fixed in
mans heart and which rules over all things without cease that is
God Alas you earnestly seek God in the blue sky while forgetting Him
altogether in your hearts Can you expect your prayers to be answered

This viewFor behold the kingdom of God is within you St Luke
xvii 21has been brought out by the philosopher Shao Yung AD
10111077 in the following lines

 The heavens are still no sound
 Where then shall God be found   
 Search not in distant skies
 In mans own heart He lies

Conflict of FaithsHan Wenkung AD 768824 the eminent
philosopher poet and statesman who suffered banishment for his
opposition to the Buddhist religion complains that of old there was
but one faith now there are threemeaning Confucianism Buddhism
and Taoism He thus pictures the simplicity of Chinas ancient kings

Their clothes were of cloth or of silk They dwelt in palaces or in
ordinary houses They ate grain and vegetables and fruit and fish and
flesh Their method was easy of comprehension their doctrines were
easily carried into practice Hence their lives passed pleasantly away
a source of satisfaction to themselves a source of benefit to mankind
At peace within their own hearts they readily adapted themselves to
the necessities of the family and of the State Happy in life they were
remembered after death Their sacrifices were grateful to the God of
Heaven and the spirits of the departed rejoiced in the honours of
ancestral worship

His mind seems to have been open on the subject of a future state In a
lamentation on the death of a favourite nephew he writes

If there is knowledge after death this separation will be but for a
little while If there is no knowledge after death so will this sorrow
be but for a little while and then no more sorrow for ever

His views as to the existence of spirits on this earth are not very
logical

If there is whistling among the rafters and I take a light but fail to
see anythingis that a spirit It is not for spirits are soundless
If there is something in the room and I look for it but cannot see
itis that a spirit It is not spirits are formless If something
brushes against me and I grab at but do not seize itis that a
spirit It is not for if spirits are soundless and formless how can
they have substance

If then spirits have neither sound nor form nor substance are they
consequently nonexistent Things which have form without sound exist in
nature for instance earth and stones Things which have sound without
form exist in nature for instance wind and thunder Things which have
both sound and form exist in nature for instance men and animals
And things which have neither sound nor form also exist in nature for
instance disembodied spirits and angels

For his own poetical spirit according to the funeral elegy written
some two hundred and fifty years after his death a great honour was
reserved

 Above in heaven there was no music and God was sad
 And summoned him to his place beside the Throne

His friend and contemporary Liu Tsungyuan a poet and philosopher like
himself was tempted into the following reflections by the contemplation
of a beautiful landscape which he discovered far from the beaten
track

Now I have always had my doubts about the existence of a God but this
scene made me think He really must exist At the same time however
I began to wonder why He did not place it in some worthy centre of
civilisation rather than in this outoftheway barbarous region where
for centuries there has been no one to enjoy its beauty And so on the
other hand such waste of labour and incongruity of position disposed me
to think that there could not be a God after all

Letter from GodIn AD 1008 there was a pretended revelation from God
in the form of a letter recalling the letter from Christ on the neglect
of the Sabbath mentioned by Roger of Wendover and Hoveden contemporary
chroniclers The Emperor and his Court regarded this communication with
profound awe but a high official of the day said I have learnt from
the Confucian Discourses that God does not even speak how then should
He write a letter

Modern MaterialismThe philosopher and commentator Chu Hsi AD
11301200 whose interpretations of the Confucian Canon are the only
ones now officially recognised has done more than any one since
Confucius himself to disseminate a rigid materialism among his
fellowcountrymen The God of the Canon is explained away as an
Eternal Principle the phenomena of the universe are attributed to
Nature with its absurd personification so commonly met with in Western
writers and spirits generally are associated with the perfervid
imaginations of sick persons and enthusiasts

Is consciousness dispersed after death or does it still exist said
an enquirer

It is not dispersed replied Chu Hsi it is at an end When vitality
comes to an end consciousness comes to an end with it

He got into more trouble over the verse quoted earlier

 King Wen is on high
 In glory in heaven
 His comings and his goings
 Are to and from the presence of God

If it is asserted he argued that King Wen was really in the
presence of God and that there really is such a Being as God He
certainly cannot have the form in which He is represented by the clay
or wooden images in vogue Still as these statements were made by the
Prophets of old there must have been some foundation for them

There is however a certain amount of inconsistency in his writings on
the supernatural for in another passage he says

When God is about to send down calamities upon us He first raises up
the hero whose genius shall finally prevail against those calamities

Sometimes he seems to be addressing the educated Confucianist at other
times the common herd whose weaknesses have to be taken into account



CHAPTER V  BUDDHISM AND OTHER RELIGIONS

So early as the third century BC Buddhism seems to have appeared in
China though it was not until the latter part of the first century AD
that a regular propaganda was established and not until a century or
two later still that this religion began to take a firm hold of the
Chinese people It was bitterly opposed by the Taoists and only after
the lapse of many centuries were the two doctrines able to exist side
by side in peace Each religion began early to borrow from the other In
the words of the philosopher Chu Hsi of the twelfth century Buddhism
stole the best features of Taoism Taoism stole the worst features of
Buddhism It is as though one took a jewel from the other and the loser
recouped the loss with a stone

From Buddhism the Taoists borrowed their whole scheme of temples
priests nuns and ritual They drew up liturgies to resemble the
Buddhist _Sutras_ and also prayers for the dead They adopted the
idea of a Trinity consisting of Lao Tzu Pan Ku and the Ruler of the
Universe and they further appropriated the Buddhist Purgatory with all
its frightful terrors and tortures after death

Nowadays it takes an expert to distinguish between the temples and
priests of the two religions and members of both hierarchies are often
simultaneously summoned by persons needing religious consolation or
ceremonial of any kind

DoubtsIn a chapter on Doubts by the Taoist philosopher Mou Tzu we
read

Some one said to Mou The Buddhist doctrine teaches that when men die
they are born again I cannot believe this

When a man is at the point of death replied Mou his family mount upon
the housetop and call to him to stay If he is already dead to whom do
they call

They call his soul said the other

If the soul comes back the man lives answered Mou but if it does
not whither does it go

It becomes a disembodied spirit was the reply

Precisely so said Mou The soul is imperishable only the body decays
just as the stalks of corn perish while the grain continues for ever
and ever Did not Lao Tzu say The reason why I suffer so much is
because I have a body

But all men die whether they have found the truth or not urged the
questioner what then is the difference between them

That replied Mou is like considering your reward before you have put
in right conduct for a single day If a man has found the truth even
though he dies his spirit will go to heaven if he has led an evil life
his spirit will suffer everlastingly A fool knows when a thing is done
but a wise man knows beforehand To have found the truth and not to have
found it are as unlike as gold and leather good and evil as black and
white How then can you ask what is the difference

Buddhism which forbids the slaughter of any living creature has wisely
abstained from denouncing the sacrifice of victims at the Temple of
Heaven and at the Confucian Temple But backed by Confucianism it
denounces the slaughter for food of the ox which tills the soil Some
lines of doggerel to this effect based upon the Buddhist doctrine of
the transmigration of souls and put into the mouth of an ox have been
rendered as follows

 My murderers shall come to grief
 Along with all who relish beef
 When Im a man and youre a cow
 Ill eat you as you eat me now

Fire WorshippersMazdeism the religion of Zoroaster based upon the
worship of fire and in that sense not altogether unfamiliar to the
Chinese reached China some time in the seventh century AD The first
temple was built at Changan the capital in 621 ten years after
which came the famous missionary Ho Lu the Magus But the lease of life
enjoyed by this religion was of short duration

IslamismMahometans first settled in China in the year of the Mission
AD 628 under WahbAbiKabcha a maternal uncle of Mahomet who was
sent with presents to the Emperor The first mosque was built at Canton
where after several restorations it still exists There is at present
a very large Mahometan community in China chiefly in the province of
Yunnan These people carry on their worship unmolested on the sole
condition that in each mosque there shall be exhibited a small tablet
with an inscription the purport of which is recognition of allegiance
to the reigning Emperor

NestoriansIn AD 631 the Nestorian Church introduced Christianity
into China under the title of The Luminous Doctrine and in 636
Nestorian missionaries were allowed to settle at the capital In 781
the famous Nestorian Tablet with a bilingual inscription in Chinese and
Syriac was set up at Singan Fu where it still remains and where it
was discovered in 1625 by Father Semedo long after Nestorianism had
altogether disappeared leaving not a rack behind

ManichaeansIn AD 719 an ambassador from Tokharestan arrived at
the capital He was accompanied by one Tamoushe who is said to have
taught the religion of the Chaldean Mani or Manes who died about AD
274 In 807 the Manichaean sect made formal application to be allowed
to have recognised places of meeting shortly after which they too
disappear from history

JudaismThe Jews known to the Chinese as those who take out the
sinew from their peculiar method of preparing meat are said by some
to have reached China and to have founded a colony in Honan
shortly after the Captivity carrying the Pentateuch with them Three
inscriptions on stone tablets are still extant dated 1489 1512 and
1663 respectively The first says the Jews came to China during the
Sung dynasty the second during the Han dynasty and the third during
the Chou dynasty The first is probably the correct account We know
that the Jews built a synagogue at Kaifeng Fu in AD 1164 where they
were discovered by Ricci in the seventeenth century and where in 1850
there were still to be found traces of the old faith now said to be
completely effaced

ChristianityWith the advent of the Jesuit Fathers in the sixteenth
century and of the Protestant missionaries Marshman and Morrison in
1799 and 1807 respectively we pass gradually down to the present day
where we may well pause and look around to see what remains to the
modern Chinese of their ancient faiths It is scarcely too much to
say that all idea of the early God of their forefathers has long since
ceased to vivify their religious instincts though the sacrifices to
God and to Earth are still annually performed by the Emperor
Ancestorworship and the cult of Confucius are probably very much
what they were many hundreds of years ago while Taoism once a pure
philosophy is now a corrupt religion As to alien faiths the Buddhism
of China would certainly not be recognised by the Founder of Buddhism
in India Mahometanism is fairly flourishing Christianity is still
bitterly opposed
