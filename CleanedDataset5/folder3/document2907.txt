TIME The present The action passes throughout midsummer day on the

ACT I

 The time is morning and the scene a level lawn beyond which
 the river is running amongst fields A huge old beech tree
 overshadows everything in the darkness of whose hollow many
 things are hidden A rustic seat encircles it A low wall
 clothed in creepers with two openings divides this lawn from
 the flowery approaches to the house Close to the wall there is
 a swing The sky is clear and sunny COLONEL HOPE is seated in
 a gardenchair reading a newspaper through pincenez He is
 fiftyfive and bald with drooping grey moustaches and a
 weatherdarkened face He wears a flannel suit and a hat from
 Panama a tennis racquet leans against his chair MRS HOPE
 comes quickly through the opening of the wall with roses in her
 hands She is going grey she wears tan gauntlets and no hat
 Her manner is decided her voice emphatic as though aware that
 there is no nonsense in its owners composition Screened from
 sight MISS BEECH is seated behind the hollow tree and JOY is
 perched on a lower branch hidden by foliage


MRS HOPE I told Molly in my letter that shed have to walk up
Tom

COLONEL Walk up in this heat My dear why didnt you order
Bensons fly

MRS HOPE Expense for nothing Bob can bring up her things in the
barrow Ive told Joy I wont have her going down to meet the train
Shes so excited about her mothers coming theres no doing anything
with her

COLONEL No wonder after two months

MRS HOPE Well shes going home tomorrow she must just keep
herself fresh for the dancing tonight Im not going to get people
in to dance and have Joy worn out before they begin

COLONEL Dropping his paper I dont like Mollys walking up

MRS HOPE A great strong woman like Molly Gwyn It isnt half a
mile

COLONEL I dont like it Nell its not hospitable

MRS HOPE Rubbish If you want to throw away money you must just
find some better investment than those wretched 3 per cents of
yours The greenflies are in my roses already Did you ever see
anything so disgusting They bend over the roses they have grown
and lose all sense of everything Wheres the syringe I saw you
mooning about with it last night Tom

COLONEL Uneasily Mooning

 He retires behind his paper MRS HOPE enters the hollow of
 the tree

Theres an account of that West Australian swindle Set of ruffians
Listen to this Nell It is understood that amongst the
shareholders are large numbers of women clergymen and Army officers
How people can be such fools

 Becoming aware that his absorption is unobserved he drops his
 glasses and reverses his chair towards the tree

MRS HOPE Reappearing with a garden syringe I simply wont have
Dick keep his fishing things in the tree theres a whole potful of
disgusting worms I cant touch them You must go and take em out
Tom

 In his turn the COLONEL enters the hollow of the tree

MRS HOPE Personally What on earths the pleasure of it I
cant see He never catches anything worth eating

 The COLONEL reappears with a paint pot full of worms he holds
 them out abstractedly

MRS HOPE Jumping Dont put them near me

MISS BEECH From behind the tree Dont hurt the poor creatures

COLONEL Turning Hallo Peachey What are you doing round
there

 He puts the worms down on the seat

MRS HOPE Tom take the worms off that seat at once

COLONEL Somewhat flurried Good gad I dont know what to do
with the beastly worms

MRS HOPE Its not my business to look after Dicks worms Dont
put them on the ground I wont have them anywhere where they can
crawl about She flicks some greenflies off her roses

COLONEL Looking into the pot as though the worms could tell him
where to put them Dash

MISS BEECH Give them to me

MRS HOPE Relieved Yes give them to Peachey

 There comes from round the tree Miss BEECH oldfashioned
 barrelshaped balloony in the skirts She takes the paint pot
 and sits beside it on the rustic seat

MISS BEECH Poor creatures

MRS HOPE Well its beyond me how you can make pets of worms
wriggling crawling horrible things

 ROSE who is young and comely in a pale print frock comes
 from the house and places letters before her on a silver
 salver

 Taking the letters

What about Miss joys frock Rose

ROSE Please m I cant get on with the back without Miss Joy

MRS HOPE Well then you must just find her I dont know where
she is

ROSE In a slow sidelong manner If you please Mum I think
Miss Joys up in the

 She stops seeing Miss BEECH signing to her with both hands

MRS HOPE Sharply What is it Peachey

MISS BEECH Selecting a finger Pricked meself

MRS HOPE Lets look

 She bends to look but Miss BEECH places the finger in her
 mouth

ROSE Glancing askance at the COLONEL If you please Mum its
below the waist I think I can manage with the dummy

MRS HOPE Well you can try Opening her letter as ROSE retires
Heres Molly about her train

MISS BEECH Is there a letter for me

MRS HOPE No Peachey

MISS BEECH There never is

COLONEL Whats that You got four by the first post

MISS BEECH Exceptions

COLONEL Looking over his glasses Why You know you get em
every day

MRS HOPE Molly says shell be down by the eleven thirty In an
injured voice Shell be here in half an hour Reading with
disapproval from the letter MAURICE LEVER is coming down by the
same train to see Mr Henty about the Tocopala Gold Mine Could you
give him a bed for the night

 Silence slight but ominous

COLONEL Calling into his aid his sacred hospitality Of course
we must give him a bed

MRS HOPE Just like a man What room I should like to know

COLONEL Pink

MRS HOPE As if Molly wouldnt have the pink

COLONEL Ruefully I thought shed have the blue

MRS HOPE You know perfectly well its full of earwigs Tom I
killed ten there yesterday morning

MISS BEECH Poor creatures

MRS HOPE I dont know that I approve of this Mr Levers dancing
attendance Mollys only thirtysix

COLONEL In a high voice You cant refuse him a bed I never
heard of such a thing

MRS HOPE Reading from the letter This gold mine seems to be a
splendid chance She glances at the COLONEL Ive put all my
spare cash into it Theyre issuing some Preference shares now if
Uncle Tom wants an investmentShe pauses then in a changed
decided voice Well I suppose I shall have to screw him in
somehow

COLONEL Whats that about gold mines Gambling nonsense Molly
ought to know my views

MRS HOPE Folding the letter away out of her consciousness Oh
your views This may be a specially good chance

MISS BEECH Ahem Special case

MRS HOPE Paying no attention I m sick of these 3 per cent
dividends When youve only got so little money to put it all into
that India Stock when it might be earning 6 per cent at least
quite safely There are ever so many things I want

COLONEL There you go

MRS HOPE As to Molly I think its high time her husband came home
to look after her instead of sticking out there in that hot place
In fact

 Miss BEECH looks up at the tree and exhibits cerebral
 excitement

I dont know what Geoffs about why doesnt he find something in
England where they could live together

COLONEL Dont say anything against Molly Nell

MRS HOPE Well I dont believe in husband and wife being
separated Thats not my idea of married life

 The COLONEL whistles quizzically

MISS BEECH Ouch She sucks her finger

MRS HOPE Well if I couldnt sew at your age Peachey without
pricking my fingers Tom if I have Mr Lever here youll just
attend to what I say and look into that mine

COLONEL Look into your grandmother I have nt made a study of
geology for nothing For every ounce you take out of a gold mine
you put an ounce and a half in Any fool knows that eh Peachey

MISS BEECH I hate your horrid mines with all the poor creatures
underground

MRS HOPE Nonsense Peachey As if theyd go there if they did nt
want to

COLONEL Why dont you read your paper then youd see what a lot of
wildcat things there are about

MRS HOPE Abstractedly I cant put Ernest and Letty in the blue
room theres only the single bed Suppose I put Mr Lever there
and say nothing about the earwigs I daresay hell never notice

COLONEL Treat a guest like that

MRS HOPE Then where am I to put him for goodness sake

COLONEL Put him in my dressingroom Ill turn out

MRS GWYN Oh Uncle Tom dont tell me what Aunt Nell thinks

towhat I mean isnever to trust too much to a man who has to do
with mining Ive always refused to have anything to do with mines
If your husband were in England of course Id say nothing

MRS GWYN Very still Wed better keep him out of the question
had nt we

COLONEL Of course if you wish it my dear

MRS GWYN Unfortunately I do

COLONEL Nervously Ah yes I know but look here Molly your
aunt thinks youre in a very delicate positionin fact she thinks
you see too much of young Lever

MRS GWYN Stretching herself like an angry cat Does she And
what do you think

COLONEL I I make a point of not thinking I only know that here
he is and I dont want you to go burning your fingers eh

 MRS GWYN sits with a vindictive smile

A gold mines a gold mine I dont mean he deliberatelybut they
take in women and parsons andand all sorts of fools Looking
down And then you know I cant tell your feelings my dear and
I dont want to but a man about town ll compromise a woman as soon
as hell look at her and softly shaking his head I dont like
that Molly It s not the thing

 MRS GWYN sits unmoved smiling the same smile and the COLONEL
 gives her a nervous look

Ifif you were any other woman I should nt careand ifif you
were a plain woman damme you might do what you liked I know you
and Geoff dont get on but heres this child of yours devoted to
you andand dont you see old girl Eh

MRS GWYN With a little hard laugh Thanks Perfectly I
suppose as you dont think Uncle Tom it never occurred to you that
I have rather a lonely time of it

COLONEL With compunction Oh my dear yes of course I know it
must be beastly

MRS GWYN Stonily It is

COLONEL Yes yes Speaking in a surprised voice I dont know
what I m talking like this for Its your aunt She goes on at me
till she gets on my nerves What d you think she wants me to do
now Put money into this gold mine Did you ever hear such folly

MRS GWYN Breaking into laughter Oh Uncle Tom

COLONEL All very well for you to laugh Molly

MRS GWYN Calmly And how much are you going to put in

COLONEL Not a farthing Why Ive got nothing but my pension and
three thousand India stock

MRS GWYN Only ninety pounds a year besides your pension D you
mean to say thats all youve got Uncle Tom I never knew that
before What a shame

COLONEL Feelingly It is a dd shame I dont suppose theres
another case in the army of a man being treated as Ive been

MRS GWYN But how on earth do you manage here on so little

COLONEL Brooding Your aunts very funny Shes a born manager
She d manage the hind leg off a donkey but if I want five shillings
for a charity or what not I have to whistle for it And then all of
a sudden Molly shell take it into her head to spend goodness knows
what on some trumpery or other and come to me for the money If I
have nt got it to give her out she flies about 3 per cent and
worries me to invest in some wildcat or other like your friends
thing the Jaco what is it I dont pay the slightest attention to
her

MRS HOPE From the direction of the house Tom

COLONEL Rising Yes dear Then dropping his voice I say
Molly dont you mind what I said about young Lever I dont want
you to imagine that I think harm of peopleyou know I dontbut so
many women come to grief andhotlyI cant stand men about town

MRS HOPE Peremptorily Tom

COLONEL In hasty confidence I find it best to let your aunt run
on If she says anything

MRS HOPE Toom

COLONEL Yes dear

 He goes hastily MRS GWYN sits drawing circles on the ground
 with her charming parasol Suddenly she springs to her feet
 and stands waiting like an animal at bay The COLONEL and MRS
 HOPE approach her talking

MRS HOPE Well how was I to know

COLONEL Did nt Joy come and tell you

MRS HOPE I dont know whats the matter with that child Well
Molly so here you are Youre before your timethat trains always

him in Peacheys room Toms got no champagne

COLONEL Theyve a very decent brand down at the George Molly Ill

MRS GWYN Of course Hes not a snob For goodness sake Aunt
Nell dont put yourself out Im sorry I suggested his coming

COLONEL My dear we ought to have champagne in the housein case
of accident

MRS GWYN Shaking him gently by the coat No please Uncle
Tom

MRS HOPE Suddenly Now Ive told your uncle Molly that hes
not to go in for this gold mine without making certain its a good
thing Mind I think youve been very rash Im going to give you a
good talking to and thats not allyou ought nt to go about like
this with a young man hes not at all bad looking I remember him
perfectly well at the Flemings dance

 On MRS GWYNs lips there comes a little mocking smile

COLONEL Pulling his wifes sleeve Nell

MRS HOPE No Tom Im going to talk to Molly shes old enough to
know better

MRS GWYN Yes

MRS HOPE Yes and youll get yourself into a mess I dont approve
of it and when I see a thing I dont approve of

COLONEL Walking about and pulling his moustache Nell I wont
have it I simply wont have it

MRS HOPE What rate of interest are these Preference shares to pay

MRS GWYN Still smiling Ten per cent

MRS HOPE What did I tell you Tom And are they safe

MRS GWYN Youd better ask Maurice

MRS HOPE There you see you call him Maurice Now supposing your
uncle went in for some of them

COLONEL Taking off his hatin a high hot voice Im not going in
for anything of the sort

MRS HOPE Dont swing your hat by the brim Go and look if you can
see him coming

 The COLONEL goes

In a lower voice Your uncles getting very bald I ve only
shoulder of lamb for lunch and a salad Its lucky its too hot to
eat

 MISS BEECH has appeared while she is speaking

Here she is Peachey

MISS BEECH I see her She kisses MRS GWYN and looks at her
intently

MRS GWYN Shrugging her shoulders Well Peachey What d you

COLONEL Returning from his search Theres a white hat crossing
the second stile Is that your friend Molly

 MRS GWYN nods

MRS HOPE Oh before I forget PeacheyLetty and Ernest can move
their things back again Im going to put Mr Lever in your room
Catching sight o f the paint pot on the ground Theres that
disgusting paint pot Take it up at once Tom and put it in the
tree

 The COLONEL picks up the pot and bears it to the hollow tree
 followed by MRS HOPE he enters

MRS HOPE Speaking into the tree Not there

COLONEL From within Well where then

MRS HOPE Whyupoh gracious

 MRS GWYN standing alone is smiling LEVER approaches from
 the towingpath He is a man like a fencers wrist supple and
 steely A man whose age is difficult to tell with a quick
 goodlooking face and a line between his brows his darkish
 hair is flecked with grey He gives the feeling that he has
 always had to spurt to keep pace with his own life

MRS HOPE Also entering the hollow tree Nooh

COLONEL From the depths in a high voice Well dash it then
What do you want

MRS GWYN Peachey may I introduce Mr Lever to you Miss Beech
my old governess

 They shake each other by the hand

LEVER How do you do His voice is pleasant his manner easy

MISS BEECH Pleased to meet you

 Her manner is that of one who is not pleased She watches

MRS GWYN Pointing to the treemaliciously This is my uncle and
my aunt Theyre taking exercise I think

 The COLONEL and MRS HOPE emerge convulsively They are very
 hot LEVER and MRS GWYN are very cool

MRS HOPE Shaking hands with him So you ve got here Are nt
you very hotTom

COLONEL Brought a splendid day with you Splendid

 As he speaks Joy comes running with a bunch of roses seeing
 LEVER she stops and stands quite rigid

MISS BEECH Sitting in the swing Thunder

COLONEL Thunder Nonsense Peachey youre always imagining
something Look at the sky

MISS BEECH Thunder

 MRS GWYNs smile has faded 

MRS HOPE Turning Joy dont you see Mr Lever

 Joy turning to her mother gives her the roses With a forced
 smile LEVER advances holding out his hand

LEVER How are you Joy Have nt seen you for an age

JOY Without expression I am very well thank you

 She raises her hand and just touches his MRS GWYNS eyes
 are fixed on her daughter Miss BEECH is watching them
 intently MRS HOPE is buttoning the COLONELS coat


 The curtain falls





ACT II

 It is afternoon and at a gardentable placed beneath the hollow
 tree the COLONEL is poring over plans Astride of a
 gardenchair LEVER is smoking cigarettes DICK is hanging
 Chinese lanterns to the hollow tree

LEVER Of course if this level pointing with his cigarette
peters out to the West we shall be in a tightish place you know what
a mine is at this stage Colonel Hope

COLONEL Absently Yes yes Tracing a line What is there to
prevent its running out here to the East

LEVER Well nothing except that as a matter of fact it doesnt

COLONEL With some excitement Im very glad you showed me these
papers very glad I say that its a most astonishing thing if the
ore suddenly stops there A gleam of humour visits LEVERS face
Im not an expert but you ought to prove that ground to the East
more thoroughly

LEVER Quizzically Of course sir if you advise that

COLONEL If it were mine Id no more sit down under the belief that
the ore stopped there than I dTheres a harmony in these things

NEVER I can only tell you what our experts say

COLONEL Ah Experts No faith in themnever had Miners
lawyers theologians cowardly lotpays them to be cowardly When
they have nt their own axes to grind theyve got their theories a
theorys a dangerous thing He loses himself in contemplation of
the papers Now my theory is you re in strata here of what we
call the Triassic Age

LEVER Smiling faintly Ah

COLONEL Youve struck a fault thats whats happened The ore may
be as much as thirty or forty yards out but it s there depend on
it

LEVER Would you back that opinion sir

COLONEL With dignity I never give an opinion that Im not
prepared to back I want to get to the bottom of this Whats to
prevent the gold going down indefinitely

LEVER Nothing so far as I know

COLONEL With suspicion Eh

LEVER All I can tell you is This is as far as weve got and we
want more money before we can get any farther

COLONEL Absently Yes yes thats very usual

LEVER If you ask my personal opinion I think its very doubtful
that the gold does go down

COLONEL Smiling Oh a personal opinion a matter of this sort

LEVER As though about to take the papers Perhaps wed better
close the sitting sir sorry to have bored you

COLONEL Now now Dont be so touchy If Im to put money in Im
bound to look at it all round

LEVER With lifted brows Please dont imagine that I want you to
put money in

COLONEL Confound it sir D you suppose I take you for a Company
promoter

LEVER Thank you

COLONEL Looking at him doubtfully Youve got Irish blood in
youum Youre so hasty

LEVER If you re really thinking of taking sharesmy advice to you
is dont

COLONEL Regretfully If this were an ordinary gold mine I
wouldnt dream of looking at it I want you to understand that
Nobody has a greater objection to gold mines than I

LEVER Looks down at his host with halfclosed eyes But it is a
gold mine Colonel Hope

COLONEL I know I know but I ve been into it for myself Ive
formed my opinion personally Now what s the reason you dont want
me to invest

LEVER Well if it doesnt turn out as you expect youll say its
my doing I know what investors are

COLONEL Dubiously If it were a Westralian or a Kaffir I would
nt touch it with a pair of tongs It s not as if I were going to
put much in He suddenly bends above the papers as though
magnetically attracted I like these Triassic formations

 DICK who has hung the last lantern moodily departs

LEVER Looking after him That young man seems depressed

COLONEL As though remembering his principles I dont like
mines never have Suddenly absorbed again I tell you what
Leverthis things got tremendous possibilities You dont seem to
believe in it enough No mines any good without faith until I see
for myself however I shant commit myself beyond a thousand

LEVER Are you serious sir

COLONEL Certainly Ive been thinking it over ever since you told
me Henty had fought shy I ve a poor opinion of Henty Hes one of
those fellows that says one thing and does another An opportunist

LEVER Slowly Im afraid were all that more or less He sits
beneath the hollow tree

COLONEL A man never knows what he is himself There s my wife
She thinks she sBy the way dont say anything to her about
this please And Lever nervously I dont think you know this
is quite the sort of thing for my niece

LEVER Quietly I agree I mean to get her out of it

COLONEL A little taken aback Ah You know sheshes in a
very delicate position living by herself in London LEVER looks at
him ironically You very nervously see a good deal of her If
it had nt been for Joy growing so fast we shouldnt have had the
child down here Her mother ought to have her with her Eh Dont
you think so

LEVER Forcing a smile Mrs Gwyn always seems to me to get on
all right

COLONEL As though making a discovery You know Ive found that
when a womans living alone and unprotected the very least thing
will set a lot of hags and jackanapes talking Hotly The more
unprotected and helpless a woman is the more they revel in it If
theres anything I hate in this world its those wretched creatures
who babble about their neighbours affairs

LEVER I agree with you

COLONEL One ought to be very careful not to give themthat is
checks himself confused then hurrying onI suppose you and Joy
get on all right

LEVER Coolly Pretty well thanks Im not exactly in Joys
line have nt seen very much of her in fact

 Miss BEECH and JOY have been approaching from the house But
 seeing LEVER JOY turns abruptly hesitates a moment and with
 an angry gesture goes away

COLONEL Unconscious Wonderfully affectionate little thing Well
shell be going home tomorrow

MISS BEECH Who has been gazing after JOY Talkin business poor
creatures

LEVER Oh no If youll excuse me Ill wash my hands before tea

 He glances at the COLONEL poring over papers and shrugging
 his shoulders strolls away

MISS BEECH Sitting in the swing I see your horrid papers

COLONEL Be quiet Peachey

MISS BEECH On a beautiful summers day too

COLONEL Thatll do now

MISS BEECH Unmoved For every ounce you take out of a gold mine
you put two in

COLONEL Who told you that rubbish

MISS BEECH With devilry You did

COLONEL This is nt an ordinary gold mine

MISS BEECH Oh quite a special thing

 COLONEL stares at her but subsiding at hey impassivity he
 pores again over the papers

 Rosy has approached with a tea cloth

ROSE If you please sir the Missis told me to lay the tea

COLONEL Go away Ten fives fifty Ten 5 16ths Peachey

MISS BEECH I hate your nasty sums

 ROSE goes away The COLONEL Writes MRS HOPES voice is
 heard Now then bring those chairs you two Not that one
 Ernest ERNEST and LETTY appear through the openings of the
 wall each with a chair

COLONEL With dull exasperation What do you want

LETTY Tea Father

 She places her chair and goes away

ERNEST That Johnnybird Lever is too cocksure for me Colonel
Those South American things are no good at all I know all about
them from young Scrotton Theres not one thats worth a red cent
If you want a flutter

COLONEL Explosively Flutter Im not a gambler sir

ERNEST Well Colonel with a smile I only dont want you to chuck
your money away on a stiff un If you want anything good you should
go to Mexico

COLONEL Jumping up and holding out the map Go to He stops in
time What dyou call that eh MEX

ERNEST Not to be embarrassed It all depend on what part

COLONEL You think you know everythingyou think nothings right
unless its your own idea Be good enough to keep your advice to
yourself

ERNEST Moving with his chair and stopping with a smile If you
ask me I should say it wasnt playing the game to put Molly into a
thing like that

COLONEL What do you mean sir

ERNEST Any Juggins can see that shes a bit gone on our friend

COLONEL Freezingly Indeed

ERNEST Hes not at all the sort of Johnny that appeals to me

COLONEL Really

ERNEST Unmoved If I were you Colonel I should tip her the
wink He was hanging about her at Ascot all the time It s a bit
thick

 MRS HOPE followed by ROSE appears from the house

COLONEL Stammering with passion Jackanapes

MRS HOPE Dont stand there Tom clear those papers and let Rose
lay the table Now Ernest go and get another chair

 The COLONEL looks wildly round and sits beneath the hollow
 tree with his head held in his hands ROSE lays the cloth

MRS BEECH Sitting beside the COLONEL Poor creature

ERNEST Carrying his chair about with him Ask any Johnny in the
City he ll tell you Mexicos a very tricky countrythe people are
awful rotters

MRS HOPE Put that chair down Ernest

 ERNEST looks at the chair puts it down opens his mouth and
 goes away ROSE follows him

Whats he been talking about You oughtnt to get so excited Tom
is your head bad old man Here take these papers She hands the
papers to the COLONEL Peachey go in and tell them tea ll be
ready in a minute there s a good soul Oh and on my dressing
table youll find a bottle of Eau de Cologne

MRS BEECH Dont let him get in a temper again That s three
times today

 She goes towards the house 

COLONEL Never met such a fellow in my life the most opinionated
narrowmindedthinks he knows everything Whatever Letty could see
in him I cant think Pragmatical beggar

MRS HOPE Now Tom What have you been up to to get into a state
like this

COLONEL Avoiding her eyes I shall lose my temper with him one
of these days Hes got that confounded habit of thinking nobody can
be right but himself

MRS HOPE Thats enough I want to talk to you seriously Dicks
in love Im perfectly certain of it

COLONEL Love Whos he in love withPeachey

MRS HOPE You can see it all over him If I saw any signs of Joys
breaking out Id send them both away I simply wont have it

COLONEL Why shes a child

MRS HOPE Pursuing her own thoughts But she isntnot yet
Ive been watching her very carefully Shes more in love with her
Mother than any one follows her about like a dog Shes been quite
rude to Mr Lever

COLONEL Pursuing his own thoughts I dont believe a word of it

 He rises and walks about

MRS HOPE Dont believe a word of what

 The COLONEL is Silent

 Pursuing his thoughts with her own

If I thought there was anything between Molly and Mr Lever d you
suppose Id have him in the house

 The COLONEL stops and gives a sort of grunt

Hes a very nice fellow and I want you to pump him well Tom and
see what there is in this mine

COLONEL Uneasily Pump

MRS HOPE Looking at him curiously Yes you ve been up to
something Now what is it

COLONEL Pump my own guest I never heard of such a thing

MRS HOPE There you are on your high horse I do wish you had a
little commonsense Tom

COLONEL Id as soon you asked me to sneak about eavesdropping
Pump

MRS HOPE Well what were you looking at these papers for It does
drive me so wild the way you throw away all the chances you have of
making a little money Ive got you this opportunity and you do
nothing but rave up and down and talk nonsense

COLONEL In a high voice Much you know about it I ve taken a
thousand shares in this mine

 He stops dead There is a silence 

MRS HOPE You veWHAT Without consulting me Well then
you ll just go and take them out again

COLONEL You want me to

MRS HOPE The idea As if you could trust your judgment in a thing
like that You ll just go at once and say there was a mistake then
we ll talk it over calmly

COLONEL Drawing himself up Go back on what I ve said Not if I
lose every penny First you worry me to take the shares and then
you worry me notI wont have it Nell I wont have it

MRS HOPE Well if Id thought youd have forgotten what you said
this morning and turned about like this dyou suppose Id have
spoken to you at all Now do you

COLONEL Rubbish If you cant see that this is a special
opportunity

 He walks away followed by MRS HOPE who endeavors to make him
 see her point of view ERNEST and LETTY are now returning from
 the house armed with a third chair

LETTY Whats the matter with everybody Is it the heat

ERNEST Preoccupied and sitting in the swing That sportsman
Lever you know ought to be warned off

LETTY Signing to ERNEST Wheres Miss Joy Rose

ROSE Dont know Miss

 Putting down the tray she goes


 ROSE has followed with the tea tray

LETTY Ernie be careful you never know where Joy is

ERNEST Preoccupied with his reflections Your old Dad s as mad
as a hatter with me

LETTY Why

ERNEST Well I merely said what I thought that Molly ought to look
out whats shes doing and he dropped on me like a cartload of
bricks

LETTY The Dads very fond of Molly

ERNEST But look here dyou mean to tell me that she and Lever
are nt

LETTY Dont Suppose they are If joy were to hear itd be simply
awful I like Molly I m not going to believe anything against
her I dont see the use of it If it is it is and if it is nt
it is nt

ERNEST Well all I know is that when I told her the mine was
probably a frost she went for me like steam

LETTY Well so should I She was only sticking up for her friends

ERNEST Ask the old Peacheybird She knows a thing or two Look
here I dont mind a mans being a bit of a sportsman but I think
Mollys bringin him down here is too thick Your old Dads got one
of his notions that because this Jossers his guest he must keep him
in a glass case and take shares in his mine and all the rest of it

LETTY I do think people are horrible always thinking things Its
not as if Molly were a stranger Shes my own cousin I m not
going to believe anything about my own cousin I simply wont

ERNEST Reluctantly realising the difference that this makes I
suppose it does make a difference her bein your cousin

LETTY Of course it does I only hope to goodness no one will make
Joy suspect

 She stops and buts her finger to her lips for JOY is coming
 towards them as the teabell sounds She is followed by DICK
 and MISS BEECH with the Eau de Cologne The COLONEL and MRS
 HOPE are also coming back discussing still each others point
 of view

JOY Where s Mother Isnt she here

MRS HOPE Now Joy come and sit down your mothers been told teas
ready if she lets it get cold its her lookout

DICK Producing a rug and spreading it beneath the tree Plenty
of room Joy

JOY I dont believe Mother knows Aunt Nell

 MRS GWYN and LEVER appear in the opening of the wall

LETTY Touching ERNESTs arm Look Ernie Four couples and
Peachey

ERNEST Preoccupied What couples

JOY Oh Mums here you are

 Seizing her she turns her back on LEVER They sit in various
 seats and MRS HOPE pours out the tea

MRS HOPE Hand the sandwiches to Mr Lever Peachey Its our own
jam Mr Lever

LEVER Thanks He takes a bite Its splendid

MRS GWYN With forced gaiety Its the first time Ive ever seen
you eat jam

LEVER Smiling a forced smile Really But I love it

MRS GWYN With a little bow You always refuse mine

JOY Who has been staring at her enemy suddenly Im all burnt
up Are nt you simply boiled Mother

 She touches her Mothers forehead

MRS GWYN Ugh Youre quite clammy Joy

JOY Its enough to make any one clammy

 Her eyes go back to LEVERS face as though to stab him

ERNEST From the swing I say you know the glass is going down

LEVER Suavely The glass in the halls steady enough

ERNEST Oh I never go by that thats a rotten old glass

COLONEL Oh is it

ERNEST Paying no attention Ive got a little rippernever puts
you in the cart Bet you what you like we have thunder before
tomorrow night

MISS BEECH Removing her gaze from JOY to LEVER You dont think
we shall have it before tonight do you

LEVER Suavely I beg your pardon did you speak to me

MISS BEECH I said you dont think we shall have the thunder before
tonight do you

 She resumes her watch on joy

LEVER Blandly Really I dont see any signs of it

 Joy crossing to the rug flings herself down And DICK sits
 crosslegged with his eyes fast fixed on her

MISS BEECH Eating People dont often see what they dont want
to do they

 LEVER only lifts his brows

MRS GWYN Quickly breaking ivy What are you talking about The
weathers perfect

MISS BEECH Isnt it

MRS HOPE Youd better make a good tea Peachey nobodyll get
anything till eight and then only cold shoulder You must just put
up with no hot dinner Mr Lever

LEVER Bowing Whatever is good enough for Miss Beech is good
enough for me

MISS BEECH Sardonicallytaking another sandwich So you think

MRS GWYN With forced gaiety Dont be so absurd Peachey

 MISS BEECH grunts slightly

COLONEL Once more busy with his papers I see the name of your
engineer is RodriguezItalian eh

LEVER Portuguese

COLONEL Dont like that

LEVER I believe he was born in England

COLONEL Reassured Oh was he Ah

ERNEST Awful rotters those Portuguese

COLONEL There you go

LETTY Well Father Ernie only said what you said

MRS HOPE Now I want to ask you Mr Lever is this gold mine safe
If it isntI simply wont allow Tom to take these shares he cant
afford it

LEVER It rather depends on what you call safe Mrs Hope

MRS HOPE I dont want anything extravagant of course if theyre
going to pay their 10 per cent regularly and Tom can have his money
out at any timeThere is a faint whistle from the swing I only
want to know that its a thoroughly genuine thing

MRS GWYN Indignantly As if Maurice would be a Director if it
was nt

MRS HOPE Now Molly Im simply asking

MRS GWYN Yes you are

COLONEL Rising Ill take two thousand of those shares Lever
To have my wife talk like thatI m quite ashamed

LEVER Oh come sir Mrs Hope only meant

 MRS GWYN looks eagerly at LEVER

DICK Quietly Lets go on the river Joy

 JOY rises and goes to her Mothers chair

MRS HOPE Of course What rubbish Tom As if any one ever
invested money without making sure

LEVER Ironically It seems a little difficult to make sure in
this case There isnt the smallest necessity for Colonel Hope to
take any shares and it looks to me as if hed better not

 He lights a cigarette

MRS HOPE Now Mr Lever dont be offended Im very anxious for
Tom to take the shares if you say the things so good

LEVER I m afraid I must ask to be left out please

JOY Whispering Mother if youve finished do come I want to
show you my room

MRS HOPE I would nt say a word only Toms so easily taken in

MRS GWYN Fiercely Aunt Nell how cant you Joy gives a
little savage laugh

LETTY Hastily Ernie will you play Dick and me Come on Dick

 All three go out towards the lawn

MRS HOPE You ought to know your Uncle by this time Molly Hes
just like a child Hed be a pauper tomorrow if I did nt see to
things

COLONEL Understand once for all that I shall take two thousand
shares in this mine I mI m humiliated He turns and goes
towards the house

MRS HOPE Well what on earth have I said

 She hurries after him 

MRS GWYN In a low voice as she passes You need nt insult my
friends

 LEVER shrugging his shoulders has strolled aside JOY with
 a passionate movement seen only by Miss BEECH goes off towards
 the house MISS BEECH and MRS GWYN aye left alone beside the
 remnants of the feast

MISS BEECH Molly

 MRS GWYN looks up startled

Take care Molly take care The child Cant you see
Apostrophising LEVER Take care Molly take care

LEVER Coming back Awfully hot is nt it

MISS BEECH Ah and itll be hotter if we dont mind

LEVER Suavely Do we control these things

 MISS BEECH looking from face to face nods her head repeatedly
 then gathering her skirts she walks towards the house MRS
 GWYN sits motionless staying before her

Extraordinary old lady He pitches away his cigarette Whats the
matter with her Molly

MRS GWYN With an effort Oh Peacheys a character

LEVER Frowning So I see There is a silence

MRS GWYN Maurice

LEVER Yes

MRS GWYN Aunt Nells hopeless you mustnt mind her

LEVER In a dubious and ironic voice My dear girl I ve too
much to bother me to mind trifles like that

MRS GWYN Going to him suddenly Tell me wont you

 LEVER shrugs his shoulders

A month ago youd have told me soon enough

LEVER Now Molly

MRS GWYN Ah With a bitter smile The Springs soon over

LEVER It s always Spring between us

MRS GWYN Is it

LEVER You did nt tell me what you were thinking about just now
when you sat there like stone

MRS GWYN It does nt do for a woman to say too much

LEVER Have I been so bad to you that you need feel like that
Molly

MRS GWYN With a little warm squeeze of his arm Oh my dear
its only that Im so

She stops

LEVER Gently So what

MRS GWYN In a low voice Its hateful here

LEVER I didnt want to come I dont understand why you suggested
it MRS GWYN is silent Its been a mistake

MRS GWYN Her eyes fixed on the ground Joy comes home
tomorrow I thought if I brought you hereI should know

LEVER Vexedly Um

MRS GWYN Losing her control Cant you SEE It haunts me How
are we to go on I must knowI must know

LEVER I dont see that my coming

MRS GWYN I thought I should have more confidence I thought I
should be able to face it better in London if you came down here
openlyand nowI feel I must nt speak or look at you

LEVER You dont think your Aunt

MRS GWYN Scornfully She Its only Joy I care about

LEVER Frowning We must be more careful thats all We mustnt
give ourselves away again as we were doing just now

MRS GWYN When any one says anything horrid to you I cant help
it

 She puts her hand on the label of his coat

LEVER My dear child take care

 MRS GWYN drops her hand She throws her head back and her
 throat is seen to work as though she were gulping down a bitter
 draught She moves away

Following hastily Dont dear dont I only meantCome Molly
lets be sensible I want to tell you something about the mine

MRS GWYN With a quavering smile Yeslet s talk sensibly and
walk properly in this sensible proper place

 LEVER is seen trying to soothe her and yet to walk properly
 As they disappear they are viewed by JOY who like the shadow
 parted from its figure has come to join it again She stands
 now foiled a carnation in her hand then flings herself on a
 chair and leans her elbows on the table

JOY I hate him Pig

ROSE Who has come to clear the tea things Did you call Miss

JOY Not you

ROSE Motionless No Miss

JOY Leaning back and tearing the flower Oh do hurry up Rose

ROSE Collects the tea things Mr Dicks coming down the path
Arent I going to get you to do your frock Miss Joy

JOY No

ROSE What will the Missis say

JOY Oh dont be so stuck Rose

 ROSE goes but DICK has come

DICK Come on the river Joy just for half an hour as far as the

look at him and from that look he gains a little courage Do come
Itll be the last time I feel it awfully Joy

JOY Theres nothing to hurt you

DICK Gloomily Isnt therewhen youre like this

JOY In a hard voice If you dont like me why do you follow me

DICK What is the matter

JOY Looking up as if for want of air Oh Dont

DICK Oh Joy what is the matter Is it the heat

JOY With a little laugh Yes

DICK Have some Eau de Cologne I ll make you a bandage He
takes the Eau de Cologne and makes a bandage with his handkerchief
Its quite clean

JOY Oh Dick you are so funny

DICK Bandaging her forehead I cant bear you to feel bad it
puts me off completely I mean I dont generally make a fuss about
people but when it s you

JOY Suddenly Im all right

DICK Is that comfy

JOY With her chin up and her eyes fast closed Quite

DICK Im not going to stay and worry you You ought to rest
Only Joy Look here If you want me to do anything for you any
time

JOY Half opening her eyes Only to go away

 DICK bites his lips and walks away

DicksoftlyDick

 DICK stops

I didnt mean that will you get me some wateririses for this
evening

DICK Wont I He goes to the hollow tree and from its darkness
takes a bucket and a boathook I know where there are some
rippers

 JOY stays unmoving with her eyes half closed

Are you sure you re all right Joy You ll just rest here in the
shade wont you till I come backit ll do you no end of good I
shant be twenty minutes

 He goes but cannot help returning softly to make sure

Youre quite sure you re all right

 JOY nods He goes away towards the river But there is no
 rest for JOY The voices of MRS GWYN and LEVER are heard
 returning

JOY With a gesture of anger Hateful Hateful

 She runs away

 MRS GWYN and LEVER are seen approaching they pass the tree
 in conversation

MRS GWYN But I dont see why Maurice

LEVER We mean to sell the mine we must do some more work on it
and for that we must have money

MRS GWYN If you only want a little I should have thought you
could have got it in a minute in the City

LEVER Shaking his head No no we must get it privately

MRS GWYN Doubtfully Oh She slowly adds Then it isnt
such a good thing

 And she does not look at him

LEVER Well we mean to sell it

MRS GWYN What about the people who buy

LEVER Dubiously regarding her My dear girl theyve just as
much chance as we had It s not my business to think of them
Theres YOUR thousand pounds

MRS GWYN Softly Dont bother about my money Maurice I dont
want you to do anything not quite

LEVER Evasively Oh Theres my brothers and my sisters too
I m not going to let any of you run any risk When we all went in
for it the thing looked splendid it s only the last month that we
ve had doubts What bothers me now is your Uncle I dont want him
to take these shares It looks as if Id come here on purpose

MRS GWYN Oh he mustnt take them

LEVER That s all very well but it s not so simple

MRS GWYN Shyly But Maurice have you told him about the
selling

LEVER Gloomily under the hollow tree It s a Board secret
Id no business to tell even you

MRS GWYN But he thinks hes taking shares in a gooda permanent
thing

LEVER You cant go into a mining venture without some risk

MRS GWYN Oh yes I knowbutbut Uncle Tom is such a dear

LEVER Stubbornly I cant help his being the sort of man he is
I did nt want him to take these shares I told him so in so many
words Put yourself in my place Molly how can I go to him and say
This thing may turn out rotten when he knows I got you to put your
money into it

 But JOY the lost shadow has come back She moves forward
 resolutely They are divided from her by the hollow tree she
 is unseen She stops

MRS GWYN I think he ought to be told about the selling it s not
fair

LEVER What on earth made him rush at the thing like that I dont
understand that kind of man

MRS GWYN Impulsively I must tell him Maurice I cant let him
take the shares without

 She puts her hand on his arm

 Joy turns as if to go back whence she came but stops once
 more

LEVER Slowly and very quietly I did nt think youd give me
away Molly

MRS GWYN I dont think I quite understand

LEVER If you tell the Colonel about this sale the poor old chap
will think me a man that you ought to have nothing to do with Do
you want that

 MRS GWYN giving her lover a long look touches his sleeve
 JOY slipping behind the hollow tree has gone

You cant act in a case like this as if you d only a principle to
consider It s thethe special circumstances

MRS GWYN With a faint smile But youll be glad to get the
money wont you

LEVER By George if youre going to take it like this Molly

MRS GWYN Dont

LEVER We may not sell after all dear we may find it turn out
trumps

MRS GWYN With a shiver I dont want to hear any more I know
women dont understand Impulsively Its only that I cant bear
any one should think that you

LEVER Distressed For goodness sake dont look like that Molly
Of course Ill speak to your Uncle Ill stop him somehow even if
I have to make a fool of myself I ll do anything you want

MRS GWYN I feel as if I were being smothered here

LEVER It s only for one day

MRS GWYN With sudden tenderness Its not your fault dear I
ought to have known how it would be Well lets go in

 She sets her lips and walks towards the house with LEVER
 following But no sooner has she disappeared than JOY comes
 running after she stops as though throwing down a challenge
 Her cheeks and ears are burning

JOY Mother

 After a moment MRS GWYN reappears in the opening of the wall

MRS GWYN Oh here you are

 white She slowly fans herself

morphia the only time I took it was in Burmah Id raging neuralgia
for two days I went to our old doctor and I made him give me some
Look here doctor I said I hate the idea of morphia I ve never
taken it and I never want to

MISS BEECH Looking at MRS GWYN When a tooth hurts you should

COLONEL You say that because it was nt your own

MISS BEECH Well it was hollow and you broke your principles

COLONEL Hollow yourself Peachey youre as bad as any one

 She gets up suddenly as though deprived of air

COLONEL Who follows anxiously Your Aunts got some firstrate
sal volatile

MRS GWYN Its all right Uncle Tom I felt giddy its nothing

COLONEL Thats the dancing He taps his forehead I know what

MRS GWYN With a sudden bitter outburst I suppose you think I
m a very bad mother to be amusing myself while joys suffering

COLONEL My dear girl whatever put such a thought into your head
We all know if there were anything you could do youd do it at once

 MISS BEECH turns a slow look on MRS GWYN

MRS GWYN Ah you see Peachey knows me better

COLONEL Following up his thoughts I always think women are
wonderful Theres your Aunt shes very funny but if theres
anything the matter with me shell sit up all night but when shes
ill herself and you try to do anything for her out she raps at
once

MRS GWYN In a low voice Theres always one that a woman will
do anything for

COLONEL Exactly what I say With your Aunt its me and by George
Molly sometimes I wish it was nt

MISS BEECH With meaning But is it ever for another woman

COLONEL You old cynic D you mean to say Joy wouldnt do anything
on earth for her Mother or Molly for Joy You dont know human
nature What a wonderful night Have nt seen such a moon for
years shes like a great great lamp

 MRS GWYN hiding from Miss BEECHs eyes rises and slips her
 arm through his they stand together looking at the moon

Dont like these Chinese lanterns with that moontawdry eh By
Jove Molly I sometimes think we humans are a rubbishy loteach of
us talking and thinking of nothing but our own petty little affairs
and when you see a great thing like that up thereSighs But
theres your Aunt if I were to say a thing like that to her she d
shed think me a lunatic and yet you know she s a very good
woman

MRS GWYN Half clinging to him Do you think me very selfish
Uncle Tom

COLONEL My dearwhat a fancy Think you selfishof course I
dont why should I

MRS GWYN Dully I dont know

COLONEL Changing the subject nervously I like your friend
Lever Molly He came to me before dinner quite distressed about
your Aunt beggin me not to take those shares She ll be the first
to worry me but he made such a point of it poor chapin the end I
was obliged to say I wouldnt I thought it showed very nice
feeling Ruefully Its a pretty tight fit to make two ends meet
on my incomeIve missed a good thing all owing to your Aunt
Dropping his voice I dont mind telling you Molly I think
theyve got a much finer mine there than theyve any idea of

 MRS GWYN gives way to laughter that is very near to sobs

With dignity I cant see what there is to laugh at

MRS GWYN I dont know whats the matter with me this evening

MISS BEECH In a low voice I do

COLONEL There there Give me a kiss old girl He kisses her on
the brow Why your foreheads as hot as fire I knowI knowyou

beneath his arm Lets go and have a look at the moon on the river
We all get upset at times eh Lifting his hand as if he had been
stung Why you re not crying Molly I say Dont do that old
girl it makes me wretched Look here Peachey Holding out the
hand on which the tear has dropped This is dreadful

MRS GWYN With a violent effort Its all right Uncle Tom

 MISS BEECH wipes her own eyes stealthily From the house is
 heard the voice of MRS HOPE calling Tom

MISS BEECH Some one calling you

COLONEL There there my dear you just stay here and cool
yourselfI ll come backshant be a minute He turns to go

 MRS HOPES voice sounds nearer

Turning back And Molly old girl dont you mind anything I said
I dont remember what it wasit must have been something I suppose

 He hastily retreats

MRS GWYN In a fierce low voice Why do you torture me

MISS BEECH Sadly I dont want to torture you

MRS GWYN But you do D you think I havent seen this comingall
these weeks I knew she must find out some time But even a day
counts

MISS BEECH I dont understand why you brought him down here

MRS GWYN After staring at her bitterly When day after day and
night after night youve thought of nothing but how to keep them
both you might a little want to prove that it was possible mightnt
you But you dont understandhow should you Youve never been a
mother And fiercely Youve never had a lov

 MISS BEECH raises her faceit is all puckered

Impulsively Oh I did nt mean that Peachey

MISS BEECH All right my dear

MRS GWYN Im so dragged in two She sinks into a chair I knew
it must come

MISS BEECH Does she know everything Molly

MRS GWYN She guesses

MISS BEECH Mournfully Its either him or her then my dear one
or the other you ll have to give up

MRS GWYN Motionless Lifes very hard on women

MISS BEECH Lifes only just beginning for that child Molly

MRS GWYN You dont care if it ends for me

MISS BEECH Is it as bad as that

MRS GWYN Yes

MISS BEECH Rocking hey body Poor things Poor things

MRS GWYN Are you still fond of me

MISS BEECH Yes yes my dear of course I am

MRS GWYN In spite of mywickedness

 She laughs

MISS BEECH Who am I to tell whats wicked and what is nt God

MRS GWYN Abruptly I cant

MISS BEECH Molly

MRS GWYN You dont know what youre asking

MISS BEECH If I could save you suffering my dear I would I hate
suffering if it s only a fly I hate it

MRS GWYN Turning away from her Life is nt fair Peachey go
in and leave me alone

 She leans back motionless

 Miss BEECH gets off her seat and stroking MRS GWYNs arm in
 passing goes silently away In the opening of the wall she
 meets LEVER who is looking for his partner They make way for
 each other

LEVER Going up to MRS GWYNgravely The next is our dance
Molly

MRS GWYN Unmoving Lets sit it out here then

 LEVER sits down

LEVER Ive made it all right with your Uncle

MRS GWYN Dully Oh

LEVER I spoke to him about the shares before dinner

MRS GWYN Yes he told me thank you

LEVER There s nothing to worry over dear

MRS GWYN Passionately What does it matter about the wretched
shares now I m stifling

 She throws her scarf off

LEVER I dont understand what you mean by now

MRS GWYN Dont you

LEVER We were ntJoy cant knowwhy should she I dont believe
for a minute

MRS GWYN Because you dont want to

LEVER Do you mean she does

MRS GWYN Her heart knows

 LEVER makes a movement of discomfiture suddenly MRS GWYN
 looks at him as though to read his soul

I seem to bring you nothing but worry Maurice Are you tired of me

LEVER Meeting her eyes No I am not

MRS GWYN Ah but would you tell me if you were

LEVER Softly Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof

 MRS GWYN struggles to look at him then covers her face with
 her hands

MRS GWYN If I were to give you up youd forget me in a month

LEVER Why do you say such things

MRS GWYN If only I could believe I was necessary to you

LEVER Forcing the fervour of his voice But you are

MRS GWYN Am I With the ghost of a smile Midsummer day

 She gives a laugh that breaks into a sob

 The music o f a waltz sounds from the house

LEVER For Gods sake dont MollyI dont believe in going to
meet trouble

MRS GWYN Its staring me in the face

LEVER Let the future take care of itself

 MRS GWYN has turned away her face covering it with her
 hands

Dont Molly Trying to pull her hands away Dont

MRS GWYN Oh what shall I do

 There is a silence the music of the waltz sounds louder from
 the house

Starting up Listen One cant sit it out and dance it too
Which is it to be Maurice dancingor sitting out It must be one
or the other must nt it

LEVER Molly Molly

MRS GWYN Ah my dear Standing away from him as though to show
herself How long shall I keep you This is all that s left of
me It s time I joined the wallflowers Smiling faintly Its
time I played the mother is nt it In a whisper Itll be all
sitting out then

LEVER Dont Lets go and dance itll do you good

 He puts his hands on her arms and in a gust of passion kisses
 her lips and throat

MRS GWYN I cant give you upI cant Love me oh love me

 For a moment they stand so then with sudden remembrance of
 where they are they move apart

LEVER Are you all right now darling

MRS GWYN Trying to smile Yes dearquite

LEVER Then let s go and dance They go

For a few seconds the hollow tree stands alone then from the house
ROSE comes and enters it She takes out a bottle of champagne wipes
it and carries it away but seeing MRS GWYNs scarf lying across
the chair she fingers it and stops listening to the waltz
Suddenly draping it round her shoulders she seizes the bottle of
champagne and waltzes with abandon to the music as though avenging
a long starvation of her instincts Thus dancing she is surprised
by DICK who has come to smoke a cigarette and think at the spot
where he was told to have a go ROSE startled stops and hugs the
bottle

DICK Its not claret Rose I should nt warm it

 ROSE taking off the scarf replaces it on the chair then with
 the halfwarmed bottle she retreats DICK in the swing sits
 thinking of his fate Suddenly from behind the hollow tree he
 sees Joy darting forward in her day dress with her hair about
 her neck and her skirt all torn As he springs towards her
 she turns at bay

DICK Joy

JOY I want Uncle Tom

DICK In consternation But ought you to have got upI thought
you were ill in bed oughtnt you to be lying down

JOY If have nt been in bed Wheres Uncle Tom

DICK But where have you beenyour dress is all torn Look He
touches the torn skirt

JOY Tearing it away In the fields Wheres Uncle Tom

DICK Are nt you really ill then

 Joy shakes her head

DICK showing her the irises Look at these They were the best I

DICK With sudden resolution What do you want the Colonel for

JOY I want him

JOY In a low voice The mine

DICK The mine

JOY It s notnot a proper one

DICK How do you mean Joy

JOY I overheard I dont care I listened I would nt if it had

DICK Gravely What did you hear

JOY He s keeping back something Uncle Tom ought to know

DICK Are you sure

 Joy makes a rush to pass him

Barring the way No wait a minuteyou must Was it something
that really mattersI dont want to know what

JOY Yes it was

DICK What a beastly thingare you quite certain Joy

JOY Between her teeth Yes

DICK Then you must tell him of course even if you did overhear

JOY I wont tell you

DICK Taking her wrist Was it was it your Mother

 Joy bends her head

But if it was your Mother why does nt she

JOY Let me go

DICK Still holding her I mean I cant see what

JOY How dare you How dare you Turning to the hollow tree It

DICK In deep distress Joy dear I never meant I didnt
really

 He tries to pull her hands down from her face

JOY Suddenly Oh go away go away

 MRS GWYN is seen coming back JOY springs into the tree
 DICK quickly steals away MRS GWYN goes up to the chair and
 takes the scarf that she has come for and is going again when
 JOY steals out to her

Mother

 MRS GWYN stands looking at her with her teeth set on her lower
 lip

Oh Mother it is nt true

MRS GWYN Very still What is nt true

JOY That you and he are

 Searching her Mothers face which is deadly still In a
 whisper

Then it is true Oh

MRS GWYN Thats enough Joy What I am is my affairnot yours

JOY Low and fierce Yes I do

MRS GWYN You dont Youre only a child

JOY Passionately I understand that youve hurt She stops

MRS GWYN Do you mean your Father

JOY Bowing her head Yes andand me She covers her face
ImIm ashamed

MRS GWYN I brought you into the world and you say that to me
Have I been a bad mother to you

JOY In a smothered voice Oh Mother

MRS GWYN Ashamed Am I to live all my life like a dead woman
because youre ashamed Am I to live like the dead because you re a
child that knows nothing of life Listen Joy you d better
understand this once for all Your Father has no right over me and
he knows it We ve been hateful to each other for years Can you
understand that Dont cover your face like a childlook at me

 Joy drops her hands and lifts her face MRS GWYN looks back
 at her her lips are quivering she goes on speaking with
 stammering rapidity

D you thinkbecause I suffered when you were born and because I ve
suffered since with every ache you ever had that that gives you the
right to dictate to me now In a dead voice Ive been unhappy
enough and I shall be unhappy enough in the time to come Meeting
the hard wonder in Joys face Oh you untouched things youre as
hard and cold as iron

JOY I would do anything for you Mother

MRS GWYN Exceptlet me live Joy Thats the only thing you wont
do for me I quite understand

JOY Oh Mother you dont understandI want you so and I seem to
be nothing to you now

MRS GWYN Nothing to me She smiles

JOY Mother darling if youre so unhappy lets forget it all
lets go away and I ll be everything to you I promise

MRS GWYN With the ghost of a laugh Ah Joy

JOY I would try so hard

MRS GWYN With the same quivering smile My darling I know you
would until you fell in love yourself

JOY Oh Mother I wouldnt I never would I swear it

MRS GWYN There has never been a woman joy that did not fall in
love

JOY In a despairing whisper But it s wrong of you its wicked

MRS GWYN If its wicked I shall pay for it not you

JOY But I want to save you Mother

MRS GWYN Save me Breaking into laughter

JOY I cant bear it that youif you ll onlyIll never leave
you You think I dont know what I m saying but I do because even
now II half love somebody Oh Mother Pressing her breast
I feelI feel so awfulas if everybody knew

MRS GWYN You think Im a monster to hurt you Ah yes Youll

JOY In a sudden outburst of excited fear I wont believe it
IIcantyoure deserting me Mother

MRS GWYN Oh you untouched things You

 Joy looks up suddenly sees her face and sinks down on her
 knees

JOY Motherit s for me

GWYN Ask for my life JOYdont be afraid

 Joy turns her face away MRS GWYN bends suddenly and touches
 her daughters hair JOY shrinks from that touch

Recoiling as though she had been stung I forgotI m deserting
you

 And swiftly without looking back she goes away Joy left alone
 under the hollow tree crouches lower and her shoulders shake
 Here DICK finds her when he hears no longer any sound o f
 voices He falls on his knees beside her

DICK Oh Joy dear dont cry Its so dreadful to see you I d
do anything not to see you cry Say something

 Joy is still for a moment then the shaking of the shoulders
 begins again

Joy darling Its so awful you ll make yourself ill and it is
nt worth it really I d do anything to save you painwont you
stop just for a minute

 Joy is still again

Nothing in the world s worth your crying Joy Give me just a
little look

JOY Looking in a smothered voice Dont

DICK You do look so sweet Oh Joy Ill comfort you Ill take it
all on myself I know all about it

 Joy gives a sobbing laugh

I do I ve had trouble too I swear I have It gets better it
does really

JOY You dont knowitsits

DICK Dont think about it No no no I know exactly what its
like He strokes her arm

JOY Shrinking in a whisper You mustnt

 The music of a waltz is heard again

DICK Look here joy Its no good we must talk it over calmly

JOY You dont see Its theit s the disgrace

DICK Oh as to disgraceshes your Mother whatever she does Id
like to see anybody say anything about herviciouslyId punch
his head

JOY Gulping her tears That does nt help

DICK But if she doesnt love your Father

JOY But shes married to him

DICK Hastily Yes of course I know marriage is awfully
important but a man understands these things

 Joy looks at him Seeing the impression he has made he tries
 again

I mean he understands better than a woman Ive often argued about
moral questions with men up at Oxford

JOY Catching at a straw But theres nothing to argue about

DICK Hastily Of course I believe in morals

 They stare solemnly at each other

Some men dont But I cant help seeing marriage is awfully
important

JOY Solemnly Its sacred

DICK Yes I know but there must be exceptions Joy

Joy Losing herself a little in the stress of this discussion
How can there be exceptions if a thing s sacred

DICK Earnestly All rules have exceptions thats true you
know its a proverb

JOY It cant be true about marriagehow can it when

DICK With intense earnestness But look here Joy I know a
really clever manan author He says that if marriage is a failure
people ought to be perfectly free it isnt everybody who believes
that marriage is everything Of course I believe it s sacred but
if its a failure I do think it seems awfuldont you

JOY I dont knowyesifSuddenly But its my own Mother

DICK Gravely I know of course I cant expect you to see it
in your own case like this With desperation But look here Joy
thisll show you If a person loves a person they have to decide
have nt they Well then you see that s what your Mothers done

JOY But that does nt show me anything

DICK But it does The thing is to look at it as if it was nt
yourself If it had been you and me in love Joy and it was wrong
like them of course ruefully I know youd have decided right
Fiercely But I swear I should have decided wrong
Triumphantly That s why I feel I understand your Mother

JOY Brushing her sleeve across her eyes Oh Dick you are so
sweetandandfunny

DICK Sliding his arm about her I love you Joy that s why
and I ll love you till you dont feel it any more I will Ill
love you all day and every day you shant miss anything I swear it
It s such a beautiful nightit s on purpose Look JOY looks he
looks at her But it s not so beautiful as you

JOY Bending her head You mustnt I dont knowwhats coming

DICK Sidling closer Are nt your knees tired darling II
cant get near you properly

JOY With a sob Oh Dick you are a funnycomfort

DICK Well stick together Joy always nothingll matter then

 They struggle to their feetthe waltz sounds louder

Youre missing it all I cant bear you to miss the dancing It
seems so queer Couldnt we Just a little turn

JOY No no

DICK Oh try

 He takes her gently by the waist she shrinks back

JOY Brokenly Nono Oh Dicktomorrow ll be so awful

DICK Tomorrow shant hurt you Joy nothing shall ever hurt you
again

 She looks at him and her face changes suddenly she buries it
 against his shoulder

They stand so just a moment in the moon light then turning to the
river move slowly out of sight Again the hollow tree is left alone
The music of the waltz has stopped The voices of MISS BEECH and the
COLONEL are heard approaching from the house They appear in the
opening of the wall The COLONEL carries a pair of field glasses
with which to look at the Moon

COLONEL Charming to see Molly dance with Lever their steps go so
well together I can always tell when a womans enjoying herself
Peachey

MISS BEECH Sharply Can you Youre very clever

COLONEL Wonderful that moon Im going to have a look at her
Splendid glasses these Peachy he screws them out not a better
pair in England I remember in Burmah with these glasses I used to
be able to tell a man from a woman at two miles and a quarter And
thats no joke I can tell you But on his way to the moon he has
taken a survey of the earth to the right along the river In a low
but excited voice I say I sayis it one of the maidsthe
baggage Why Its Dick By George shes got her hair down
Peachey Its Joy

 MISS BEECH goes to look He makes as though to hand the
 glasses to her but puts them to his own eyes instead
 excitedly

It is What about her headache By George theyre kissing I say
Peachey I shall have to tell Nell

MISS BEECH Are you sure theyre kissing Well thats some
comfort

COLONEL Theyre at the stile now Oughtnt I to stop them eh
He stands on tiptoe We must nt spy on them dash it all He
drops the glasses Theyre out of sight now

MISS BEECH To herself He said he wouldnt let her

COLONEL What have you been encouraging them

MISS BEECH Dont be in such a hurry

 She moves towards the hollow tree

COLONEL Abstractedly By George Peachey to think that Nell and
I were oncePoor Nell I remember just such a night as this

 He stops and stares before him sighing

MISS BEECH Impressively Its a comfort shes got that good young
man Shes found out that her mother and this Mr Lever areyou
know

COLONEL Losing all traces of his fussiness and drawing himself up
as though he were on parade You tell me that my niece

MISS BEECH Out of her own mouth

COLONEL Bowing his head I never would have believed shed have
forgotten herself

MISS BEECH Very solemnly Ah my dear Were all the same
were all as hollow as that tree When its ourselves its always a
special case

 The COLONEL makes a movement of distress and Miss BEECH goes
 to him

Dont you take it so to heart my dear

 A silence

COLONEL Shaking his head I couldnt have believed Molly would
forget that child

MISS BEECH Sadly They must go their own ways poor things She
cant put herself in the childs place and the child cant put
herself in Mollys A woman and a girltheres the tree of life
between them

COLONEL Staring into the tree to see indeed if that were the tree
alluded to Its a grief to me Peachey its a grief He sinks
into a chair stroking his long moustaches Then to avenge his
hurt Shant tell Nelldashed if I do anything to make the trouble
worse

MISS BEECH Nodding Theres suffering enough without adding to
it with our trumpery judgments If only things would last between
them

COLONEL Fiercely Last By George theyd better

 He stops and looking up with a queer sorry look

I say Peachey Lifes very funny

MISS BEECH Men and women are Touching his forehead tenderly
There theretake care of your poor dear head Tsst The blessed
innocents

 She pulls the COLONELS sleeve They slip away towards the
 house as JOY and DICK come back They are still linked
 together and stop by the hollow tree

JOY In a whisper Dick is love always like this

DICK Putting his arms around her with conviction Its never
been like this before Its you and me

 He kisses her on the lips



 The curtain falls
