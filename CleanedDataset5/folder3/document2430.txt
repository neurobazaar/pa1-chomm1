PREFACE


The ballads in this volume are translated from the Works of OEHLENSLAEGER
a poet who is yet living and who stands high in the estimation of his
countrymen and from the KIAEMPE VISER a collection of old songs
celebrating the actions of the ancient heroes of Scandinavia

The old Danish poets were for the most part extremely rude in their
versification Their stanzas of four or two lines have not the full
rhyme of vowel and consonant but merely what the Spaniards call the
assonante or vowel rhyme and attention seldom seems to have been paid
to the number of _feet_ on which the lines moved along But however
defective their poetry may be in point of harmony of numbers it
describes in vivid and barbaric language scenes of barbaric grandeur
which in these days are never witnessed and which though the modern
muse may imagine she generally fails in attempting to pourtray from the
violent desire to be smooth and tuneful forgetting that smoothness and
tunefulness are nearly synonymous with tameness and unmeaningness

I expect shortly to lay before the public a complete translation of the
KIAEMPE VISER made by me some years ago and of which I hope the
specimens here produced will not give an unfavourable idea

It was originally my intention to publish among the Miscellaneous
Pieces several translations from the Gaelic formerly the language of
the western world the noble tongue

 A labhair Padric nninse Fail na Riogh
 San faighe caomhsin Colum naomhta n I

 Which Patrick spoke in Innisfail to heathen chiefs of old
 Which Columb the mild prophetsaint spoke in his islandhold

but I have retained them with one exception till I possess a sufficient
quantity to form an entire volume




FROM ALLAN CUNNINGHAM
TO GEORGE BORROW


_On his proposing to translate the_ _Kiaepe Viser_

Sing sing my friend breathe life again
Through Norways song and Denmarks strain
On flowing Thames and Forth in flood
Pour Hacos warsong fierce and rude
Oer Englands strength through Scotlands cold
His warrior minstrels marched of old
Called on the wolf and bird of prey
To feast on Irelands shore and bay
And France thy forward knights and bold
Rough Rollos ravens croaked them cold
Sing sing of earth and oceans lords
Their songs as conquering as their swords
Strains steeped in many a strange belief
Now stern as steel now soft as grief
Wild witching warlike brief sublime
Stamped with the image of their time
When chafedthe call is sharp and high
For carnage as the eagles cry
When pleasedthe mood is meek and mild
And gentle as an unweaned child
Sing sing of haunted shores and shelves
St Oluf and his spiteful elves
Of that wise dame in true love need
Who of the clear stream formed the steed
How youthful Svend in sorrow sharp
The inspired strings rent from his harp
And Sivard in his cloak of felt
Danced with the green oak at his belt
Or sing the Sorceress of the wood
The amorous Merman of the flood
Or elves that oer the unfathomed stream
Sport thick as motes in morning beam
Or bid me sail from Iceland Isle
With Rosmer and fair Ellenlyle
What time the bloodcrows flight was south
Bearing a mans leg in its mouth
Though rough and rude those strains are rife
Of things kin to immortal life
Which touch the heart and tinge the cheek
As deeply as divinest Greek
In simple words and unsought rhyme
Give me the songs of olden time




THE DEATHRAVEN
FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER


The silken sail which caught the summer breeze
Drove the light vessel through the azure seas
Upon the lofty deck Dame Sigrid lay
And watchd the setting of the orb of day
Then all at once the smiling sky grew dark
The breakers ravd and sinking seemd the bark
The wild Deathraven perchd upon the mast
Screamd mid the tumult and awoke the blast

Dame Sigrid saw the demon bird on high
And teardrops started in her beauteous eye
Her cheeks which late like blushing roses bloomd
Had now the pallid hue of fear assumd
O wild deathraven calm thy frightful rage
Nor war with one who warfare cannot wage
Tame yonder billows make them cease to roar
And I will give thee pounds of golden ore

With gold thou must not hope to pay the brave
For gold I will not calm a single wave
For gold I will not hush the stormy air
And yet my heart is movd by thy despair
Give me the treasure hid beneath thy belt
And straight yon clouds in harmless rain shall melt
And down Ill thunder with my claws of steel
Upon the merman clinging to your keel

What I conceald beneath my girdle bear
Is thineirrevocably thineI swear
Thou hast refusd a great and noble prey
To get possession of my closet key
Lo here it is and when within thy maw
Mayst thou much comfort from the morsel draw
The polishd steel upon the deck she cast
And off the raven flutterd from the mast

Then down at once he plungd amid the main
And clove the mermans frightful head in twain
The foamclad billows to repose he brought
And tamd the tempest with the speed of thought
Then with a thricerepeated demon cry
He soard aloft and vanishd in the sky
A soft wind blew the ship towards the land
And soon Dame Sigrid reachd the wishdfor strand

Once late at eve she playd upon her harp
Close by the lake where slowly swam the carp
And as the moonbeam down upon her shone
She thought of Norway and its pinewoods lone
Yet love I Denmark said she and the Danes
For oer them Alf my mighty husband reigns
Then neath her girdle something movd and yearnd
And into terror all her bliss was turnd

Ah now I know thy meaning cruel bird    
Long sat she then and neither spoke nor stirrd
Faint through the mist which robd the sky in gray
The pale stars glimmerd from the milky way
Ah now I know thy meaning cruel bird    
She strove in vain to breathe another word
Above her head its leaf the aspen shook
Moist as her cheek and pallid as her look

Full five months passd ere she mid night and gloom
Brought forth with pain an infant from her womb
They baptizd it at midnights murky hour
Lest it should fall within the demons power
It was a boy more lovely than the morn
Yet Sigrids heart with bitter care was torn
Deep in a grot through which a brook did flow
With crystal drops they sprinkled Harralds brow

He grew and grew till upon Danish ground
No youth to match the stripling could be found
He was at once so graceful and so strong
His look was fire and his speech was song
When yet a child he tamd the battle steed
And only thought of war and daring deed
But yet Queen Sigrid nursd prophetic fears
And when she viewd him always swam in tears

One evening late she lay upon her bed
King Alf her noble spouse was long since dead
She felt so languid and her aching breast
With more than usual sorrow was oppressd
Ah then she heard a sudden sound that thrilld
Her every nerve and lifes warm current chilld
The bird of death had through the casement flown
And thus he screamd to her in frightful tone

The wealthy bird came towering
Came scowering
Oer hill and stream
Look here look here thou needy bird
How gay my feathers gleam

The needy bird came fluttering
Came muttering
And sadly sang
Look here look here thou wealthy bird
How loose my feathers hang

Remember Queen the stormy day
When cast away
Thou wast so nigh
Thou wast the needy bird that day
And unto me didst cry

Deathraven now comes towering
Comes scowering
Oer hill and stream
But when wilt thou Dame Sigrid fair
Thy plighted word redeem

A hollow moan from Sigrids bosom came
While he surveyd her with his eye of flame
Fly said she demon monster get thee hence
My humble prayr shall be my sons defence
She crossd herself and then the fiend flew out
But first contemptuously he dancd about
And sang No prayr shall save him from my rage
In Christian blood my thirst I will assuage

Young Harrald seizd his scarlet cap and cried
Ill probe the grief my mother fain would hide
Then rushing into her apartment fair
O mother said he wherefore sittst thou there
Far from thy family at dead of night
With lips so mute and cheeks so ghastly white
Tell me what lies so heavy at thy heart
Grief when confided loses half its smart

O Harrald sighd she yielding to his prayr
Creatures are swarming in the earth and air
Who wild with wickedness and hot with wrath
Wage war on those who follow virtues path
One of those fiends is on the watch for thee
Armd with a promise wrung by him from me
His bloodshot eyes in narrow sockets roll
And every night he leaves his mirksome hole

He was a kind of God in former days
Kings worshippd him and minstrels sang his praise
But when Christs doctrine through the dark North flamd
His and all evil spirits might was tamd
He now is but a raven yet is still
Full strong enough to work on thee his will
Lost is the wretch who in his power falls
Vainly he shrieks in vain for mercy calls

She whisperd to him then with bloodless lip
What had befallen her on board the ship
But youthful Harrald listend undismayd
And merely grippd the handle of his blade
My son she murmurd when her tale was told
Fear withers me but thou lookst blythe and bold
The youth uplifted then his sparkling eye
And said whilst gazing on the moonlit sky

Once my dear mother at the close of day
Among tall flowers in the grove I lay
Soft sang the linnets from a thousand trees
And sweetly lulld I slumberd by degrees
Then heavens curtain was methought undrawn
And clad in hues that deck the brow of morn
An angel slowly sank towards the earth
Which seemd to hail him with a smile of mirth

He raisd his hand and bade me fix my eye
Upon a chain which hanging from the sky
Embracd the world and stretching high and low
Clinkd as it movd the notes of joy and wo
The links that came in sight were purpled oer
Full frequently with what seemd human gore
Of various metals made it claspd the mould
Steel clung to silver iron clung to gold

Then said the angel with majestic air
The chain of destiny thou seest there
Accept whateer it gives and murmur not
For hard necessity has cast each lot
He vanishdI awoke with sudden start
But that strange dream was graven on my heart
I go wherever fate shall please to call
Without Gods leave no fly to earth can fall

It thundersand from midnights mirky cloud
Comes peal on peal reverberating loud
The frothclad breakers cast with sullen roar
A Scottish bark upon the whitend shore
Straight to the royal palace hasten then
A lovely maid and thirty seaworn men
Minona Scotlands princess Scotlands boast
The storm has driven to the Danish coast

Oft while the train hew timber in the groves
Minona arm in arm with Harrald roves
Warm from his lip the words of passion flow
Pure in her eyes the flames of passion glow
One summer eve upon a mossy bank
Mouth joind to mouth and breast to breast they sank
The moon arose in haste to see their love
And wild birds carrolld from the boughs above

But now the ship which seemd of late a wreck
Floats with a mast set proudly on her deck
Minona kisses Harralds blooming face
Whilst he attends her to the parting place
His bold young heart beats high against his side
She saild awayand like one petrified
Full long he stood upon the shore to view
The smooth keel slipping through the waters blue

Months pass and Sigrids sorrow disappears
The wild deathravens might no more she fears
A gentle red bedecks her cheek again
And briny drops her eye no longer stain
My Harrald stalks in manly size and strength
Swart bird of darkness I rejoice at length
If thy curst claw could hurt my gallant son
Long long ere this the deed would have been done

But Harrald lookd so moody and forlorn
And thus his mother he addressd one morn
Minonas face is equalld by her mind
Methinks she calls me from her hills of wind
Give me a ship with men and gold at need
And let me to her fathers kingdom speed
Ill soon return and back across the tide
Bring thee a daughter and myself a bride

Dame Sigrid promisd him an answer soon
And went that night when risen was the moon
Deep through the black recesses of the wood
To where old Brunos shelterd cabin stood
She enterdthere he sat behind his board
His woollen vestment girded by a cord
The little lamp which hung from overhead
Gleamd on the Bibleleaves before him spread

Hail to thee Fatherman of hoary age
Thy Queen demands from thee thy counsel sage
Young Harrald to a distant land will go
And I his destiny would gladly know
Thou readst the starsO do the stars portend
That he shall come to an untimely end
Take from his mothers heart this one last care
And she will always name thee in her prayr

The hermit rising from his lonely nook
With naked head and coldly placid look
Went out and gazd intently on the sky
Whose lights were letters to his ancient eye
The stars said he in friendly order stand
One only flashes like an angry brand
Thy Harrald gentle Queen will not be slain
Upon the _Earth_ nor yet upon the _Main_

While thus the seer prophetically spoke
A flush of joy oer Sigrids features broke
Hell not be slain on ocean or on land
She said and kissd the hermits wrinkled hand
Why then Im happy and my son is free
To mount his bark and gallop through the sea
Upon the grey stone he will sit as king
When in the grave my bones are mouldering

The painted galley floats now in the creek
Flags at her mast and garlands at her beak
High on the yardarm hoisted is the sail
Half spread it flutters in the evening gale
The night before he goes young Harrald strayd
Into the wood where first he saw his maid
Burning impatience feverd all his blood
He wishd for wings to bear him oer the flood

Then sighd the wind among the bushy grounds
Far in the distance rose the yell of hounds
The flamewisps starting from the sedge and grass
Hung mid the vapours over the morass
Up to him came a beldame wildly drest
Bearing a closelyfolded feathervest
She smild upon him with her cheeks so wan
Gave him the robe and was already gone

Young Harrald though astonishd has no fears
The mighty garment in his hand he rears
Of wondrous lovely feathers it was made
Which once the roc and ostrich had arrayd
He wishes much to veil in it his form
And speed as rapidly as speeds the storm
He puts it on then seeks the open plain
Takes a short flight and flutters back again

Courage he cried I will no longer stay
Scotland shall see me ere the break of day
Then like a dragon in the air he soars
Startled from slumber in his wake it roars
His wings across the ocean take their flight
Groves cities hills have vanishd from his sight
See there he goes lone rider of the sky
Miles underneath him black the billows lie

He hears a clapping on the midnight wind
Speed Harrald speed the raven is behind
Flames from his swarthyrolling eye are cast
Ha Harrald screamd he have we met at last
For the first time the youth felt terrors force
Pale grew his cheek as that of clammy corse
Chill was his blood his nervous arm was faint
While thus he stammerd forth his lowly plaint

I see it is in vain to strive with fate
Thank God my soul is far above thy hate
But ere my mortal part thou dost destroy
Let me one moment of sweet bliss enjoy
The fair unmatchd Minona is my love
For her I travelld foollike here above
Let me fly to her with my last farewell
And I am thine ere morning decks the fell

Firmly the raven holding him in air
Surveyd his prize with fiercelyrabid glare
Now is the time to wreak on thee my lust
Yet thou shalt own that I am good and just
Then from its socket Harralds eye he tore
And drank a full half of the heros gore
Since I have markd thee thou art free to go
But loiter not when thou art there below

Young Harrald sinks with many a sob and tear
Down from the sky to natures lower sphere
He rested long beneath the poplar tall
Which grew up under the red churchs wall
Then rising slow he feebly staggerd on
Till his Minonas bower he had won
Trembling and sad he stood beside the door
Pale as a spectre and besprent with gore

Minona come ere Harralds youthful heart
Is burst by love and complicated smart
Soon will his figure disappear from earth
Yet we shall meet in heavens halls of mirth
Minona come and give me one embrace
That I may instantly my path retrace
Thus warbles he in passions wildest note
While death each moment rattles in his throat

Minona came Almighty God she cried
My Harralds ghost has wanderd oer the tide
Red clots of blood his yellow tresses streak
Drops of the same are running down his cheek
Minona love survey me yet more near
It is no shadow which accosts thee here
Place thy warm hand upon my heart and feel
Whether it beats for thee with slackend zeal

At once the current of her tears she stoppd
His arm upheld her or the maid had droppd
The roses faded from her face away
And on her head the raven locks grew gray
All he had borne and what he yet must bear
He murmurs to her whilst she trembles there
The hero then with dying ardour pressd
For the last time his bosom to her breast

Farewell Minona all my fears are flown
And if I grieve it is for thee alone
Give me a kiss and give me too a smile
And let not tears that parting look defile
Now will I drink the bitter draught of death
And yield courageously my forfeit breath
Farewell may heaven take thee in its care
He said and mounted swiftly in the air

She gazd but he had vanishd from her view
She stood forsaken in the damp and dew
Then dark emotion quiverd in her eye
And thus she prayd with hands uplifted high
Thou who wert vainly tempted in the wild
Thou who wert always charitably mild
Thou who madst Peter walk on billows blue
Enable me my Harrald to pursue

Sunken already was the morning star
The song of nightingales was heard afar
The red sun peepd above the mountains brow
And flowers scented all the vale below
There came a youthful maiden gaily drest
Bearing upon her back a feathervest
Fondly she kissd Minonas features wan
Gave her the robe and then at once was gone

And straight Minona clothes in it her limbs
And soaring upward through the ether swims
To moan and sob her maddend breast disdains
Too big for such low comfort are its pains
The fowls that meet her in yon airy fields
She clips in pieces with an axe she wields
Each clanging pinion ceaselessly she plies
But cannot meet the raven or his prize

She hears a faint shriek in the air below
And swift as eagle pounces on his foe
Down down she droppd and lighted on the shore
Which far and wide was wet with Harralds gore
She smild so ruefully but still was mute
His good right hand was lying at her foot
That pledge of truth in loves unclouded day
Was the sole remnant of the demons prey

Deep in her breast she hid the bloody hand
And bade adieu for ever to the land
Again she scowerd through the airy path
Her eyeballs terrible with maddend wrath
The ravensorcerer at length she spied
And soon her steel was with his hot blood dyed
The huge black body piecemeal found a grave
Amid the bosom of the briny wave

The ocean billows fret and foam no more
But softly rush towards the pebbled shore
On which the lindens stand in many a group
With leafy boughs that oer the waters droop
There floats one single cloudlet in the blue
Close where the pale moon shows her face anew
It is Minona dying there that flies
She sinks notnoshe mounts unto the skies




FRIDLEIF AND HELGA
FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER


The woods were in leaf and they cast a sweet shade
Among them walkd Helga the beautiful maid

The water is dashing oer yon little stones
She sat down beside it and rested her bones

She sat down and soon from a bush that was near
Sir Fridleif approachd her with sword and with spear

Ah pity me Helga and fly me not now
I live only live on the smile of thy brow

In thy fathers whole garden is found not a rose
Which bright as thyself and as beautiful grows

Sir Fridleif thy words are but meant to deceive
Yet tell me what brings thee so late here at eve

I cannot find rest and I cannot find ease
Though sweet sing the linnets among the wild trees

If thou wilt but promise one day to be mine
No more shall I sorrow no more shall I pine

She sank in his arms and her cheeks were as red
As the sun when he sinks in his watery bed

But soon she arose from his loving embrace
He walkd by her side through the wood for a space

Now listen young Fridleif the gallant and bold
Take off from my finger this ring of red gold

Take off from my finger this ring of red gold
And part with it not till in death thou art cold

Sir Fridleif stood there in a sorrowful plight
Salt tears wet his eyeballs and blinded his sight

Go home and Ill come to thy father with speed
And claim thee from him on my mighty grey steed

Sir Fridleif at night through the thick forest rode
He fain would arrive at his lovd ones abode

His harness was clanking his helm glitterd sheen
His horse was so swift and himself was so keen

He reachd the proud castle and jumpd on the ground
His horse to the branch of a linden he bound

He shoulderd his mantle of grey otter skin
And through the wide door to Sir Erik went in

Here sittst thou Sir Erik in scarlet arrayd
Ive wedded thy daughter the beautiful maid

And who art thou Rider what feat hast thou done
No nidering coward shall eer be my son

O far have I wanderd renownd is my name
The heroes I conquerd wherever I came

Han Elland t is true long disputed the ground
But yet he receivd from my hand his deathwound

Sir Erik then alterd his countenance quite
And out hurried he in the gloom of the night

Fill high little Kirstin my best drinking cup
And be the brown liquor with poison mixt up

She gave him the draught and returning with speed
Young gallant said he thou must taste my old mead

Sir Fridleif unbuckled his helmet and drank
Sweat sprung from his foreheadhis features grew blank

I never have draind since the day I was born
A bitterer draught from a costlier horn

My course is completed my life is summd up
For treason I smell in the dregs of the cup

Sir Erik then said while he stampd on the ground
Young knight t is thy fortune to die like a hound

My best belovd friend thou didst boast to have slain
And I have avengd him by giving thee bane

Not Helga but Hela f1 shall now be thy bride
Dark blue are her cheeks and she looks stonyeyed

Sir Erik thy words are both witty and wise
And hell when it has thee will have a rich prize

Convey unto Helga her gold ring so red
Be sure to inform her when Fridleif is dead

But flame shall give water and marble shall bleed
Before thou shalt win by this treacherous deed

And I will not die like a hound in the straw
But go like a hero to Odin and Thor

He cut himself thrice with his keencutting glaive
And went to Valhalla f2 the way of the brave

The knight bade his daughter come into the room
Look here my sweet child on thy merry bridegroom

She lookd on the body and gave a wild start
O father why hadst thou so cruel a heart

She moand and lamented she ravd and she curst
She lookd on her love till her very eyes burst

At midnight Sir Erik was standing there mute
With two pallid corses beside his cold foot

He stood stiff and still and when morninglight came
He stood like a post without life in his frame

The youth and the maid were together interrd
Sir Erik could not from his posture be stirrd

He stood there as stiffly for thirty long days
And lookd on the earth with a petrified gaze

T is said on the night of the thirtieth long day
To dust and to ashes he moulderd away




SIR MIDDEL
FROM THE OLD DANISH


So tightly was Swanelil lacing her vest
That forth spouted milk from each lilywhite breast
That saw the Queenmother and thus she begun
What maketh the milk from thy bosom to run
O this is not milk my dear mother I vow
It is but the mead I was drinking just now
Ha out on thee minion these eyes have their sight
Wouldst tell me that mead in its colour is white
Well well since the proofs are so glaring and strong
I own that Sir Middel has done me a wrong
And was he the miscreant dear shall he pay
For the cloud he has cast on our honours bright ray
Ill hang him up yes I will hang him with scorn
And burn thee to ashes at breaking of morn
The maiden departed in anguish and wo
And straight to Sir Middel it lists her to go
Arrivd at the portal she sounded the bell
Now wake thee love if thou art living and well
Sir Middel he heard her and sprang from his bed
Not knowing her voice in confusion he said
Away for I have neither candle nor light
And I swear that no mortal shall enter this night
Now busk ye Sir Middel in Christs holy name
I fly from my mother who knows of my shame
Shell hang thee up yes she will hang thee with scorn
And burn me to ashes at breaking of morn
Ha laugh at her threatnings so empty and wild
She neither shall hang me nor burn thee my child
Collect what is precious in jewels and garb
And Ill to the stable and saddle my barb
He gave her the cloak that he usd at his need
And he lifted her up on the broadbosomd steed
The forest is gaind and the city is past
When her eyes to the heaven she wistfully cast
What ails thee dear maid we had better now stay
For thou art fatigud by the length of the way
I am not fatigud by the length of the way
But my seat is uneasy in truth I must say
He spread on the cold earth his mantle so wide
Now rest thee my love and Ill watch by thy side
O Jesus that one of my maidens were near
The pains of a mother are on me I fear
Thy maidens are now at a distance from thee
And thou art alone in the forest with me
Twere better to perish again and again
Than thou shouldst stand by me and gaze on my pain
Then take off thy kerchief and cover my head
And perhaps I may stand in the wisewomans stead
O Christ that I had but a draught of the wave
To quench my deaththirst and my temples to lave
Sir Middel was to her so tender and true
And he fetchd her the drink in her goldspangled shoe
The fountain was distant and when he drew near
Two nightingales sat there and sang in his ear
Thy love she is dead and for ever at rest
With two little babes that lie cold on her breast
Such was their song but he heeded them not
And tracd his way back to the desolate spot
But oh what a spectacle burst on his view
For all they had told him was fatally true
He dug a deep grave by the side of a tree
And buried therein the unfortunate three
As he clampd the mould down with his ironheeld boot
He thought that the babies screamd under his foot
Then placing his weapon against a grey stone
He cast himself on it and died with a groan
Ye maidens of Norway henceforward beware
For love when unbridled will end in despair




ELVIRSHADES
FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER


A sultry eve pursud a sultry day
Dark streaks of purple in the sky were seen
And shadows half conceald the lonely way

I spurrd my courser and more swiftly rode
In moody silence through the forests green
Where doves and linnets had their lone abode

It was my fate to reach a brook at last
Which by sweetscented bushes fencd around
Defiance bade to heat and nipping blast

Inclind to rest and hear the wild birds song
I stretchd myself upon that brooks soft bound
And there I fell asleep and slumberd long

And only woke O wonder to perceive
A goldhaird maiden as a snowdrop pale
Her slender form from out the ground upheave

Then fear oercame me and this daring heart
Beat three times audibly against my mail
I wishd to speak but could no sound impart

And see another maid rose up and took
Some drops of water from the foaming rill
And gazd upon me with a wistful look

Said she What brings thee to this lonely place
But do not fear for thou shalt meet no ill
Thou steelclad warrior full of youth and grace

No sang the other in delightful tone
But thou shalt gaze on prodigies which neer
To mans unhallowd eye have yet been shown

The brook which lately brawld among the trees
Stood still the murmur of that song to hear
No green leaf stirrd and fetterd seemd the breeze

The thrush upstarting in the distant dell
Shook its brown wing with golden streaks arrayd
And apd the witchnotes as they rose and fell

Bright gleamd the lakes broad sheet of liquid blue
Where with the rabid pike the troutling playd
The rose unlockd its folded leaves anew

And blushd besprinkled with the nights cold tear
Once more the lily raisd its head and smild
All ghastly white as when it decks the bier

Though sweet she sang my fears were not the less
For in her accents there was something wild
Which I can feel t is true but not express

Come with us sang she deep below the earth
Where sun neer burns and stormwinds never rave
Come with us to our halls of princely mirth

There thou shalt learn from us the Runic lay
But dip thee first in yonder crystal wave
Which binds thee to the Elfin race for aye

Though painted flowers on earths breast abound
Yet we have far more lovely ones below
Like grass the chrysolites there strew the ground

O come the other syren did exclaim
For rubies there more red than roses grow
The sapphirs blue the violet puts to shame

I raisd my eyes to heavens starry dome
And grippd my faulchion with convulsive might
Resolvd no witchcraft should my mind oercome

My lengthend silence vexd the maidens sore
Wilt thou detain us here the livelong night
Or must we stripling proffer something more

Taught by us thou shalt bind the rugged bear
Seize on the mighty dragons heap of gold
And slay the cockatrice while in her lair

But from thy breast the blood we will suck out
Unless thou follow us beneath the mould
Decide decide nor longer pause in doubt

Cold sweat I shed and as with trembling hand
I strove to whirl my beaming faulchion round
It sank enthralld by magics potent band

Each witch drew nigh with dagger high upreard
Just then a cock beyond the wild woods bound
Crew loudand in the earth they disappeard

I flung myself upon my frightend barb
Just as the shades began to grow less murk
And sunbeams clad the sky in gayer garb

Let each young warrior from such places fly
Disease and death beneath the flowers lurk
And elves would suck the warm blood from his eye




THE HEDDYBEESPECTRE
FROM THE OLD DANISH


I clomb in haste my dappled steed
And gallopd far oer mount and mead
And when the day drew nigh its close
I laid me down to take repose

I laid me down to take repose
And slumbers sweet fell oer my brows
And then methought as there I slept
From out the ground the dead man leapt

Said he If thou art valiant Knight
My murder soon will see the light
For thou wilt ride to Heddybee
Where live my youthful brothers three

And there too thou wilt surely find
My father dear and mother kind
And there sits Kate my muchloved wife
Who with her women took my life

They chokd me as in bed I lay
Then wrappd me in a truss of hay
And bore me out at dead of night
And laid me in this lonely height

The Groom who lately cleand my stall
Now struts and vapours through my hall
Eats gaily with my silver knife
And sleeps with Kate my muchlovd wife

His place is highest at the board
But what is most to be deplord
He gives my babes so little bread
And mocks them now their sire is dead

Clad in my clothes he proudly stalks
Along the shady forestwalks
And armd with bow and hunting spear
He shoots my birds and stabs my deer

Were I alive to meet him now
All underneath the linden bough
With no one nigh my wrath to check
Id wring his head from off his neck

But hie thee hence to Heddybee
Where live my youthful brothers three
First tell them allthen stab the groom
Allow my wife a milder doom




SIR JOHN
FROM THE OLD DANISH


Sir Lave to the island strayd
He wedded there a lovely maid
Ill have her yet said John

He brought her home across the main
With knights and ladies in the train
Im close behind said John

They placd her on the bridal seat
Sir Lave bade them drink and eat
Aye that we will said John

The servants led her then to bed
But could not loose her girdle red
I can perhaps said John

He shut the door with all his might
He lockd it fast and quenchd the light
I shall sleep here said John

A servant to Sir Lave hied
Sir John is sleeping with the bride
Aye that I am said John

Sir Lave to the chamber flew
Arise and straight the door undo
A likely thing said John

He struck with shield he struck with spear
Come out thou Dog and fight me here
Another time said John

And since thou with my bride hast lain
To our good king I will complain
That thou canst do said John

As soon as eer the morning shone
Sir Lave sought our monarchs throne
Ill go there too said John

O King chastise this wicked wight
For with my wife he slept last night
T is very true said John

Since ye two love one pretty face
Your lances must decide the case
With all my heart said John

The sun on high was shining bright
And thousands came to see the fight
Lo here I am said John

The first course that they ran so free
Sir Johns horse fell upon his knee
Now help me God said John

The next course that they ran in ire
Sir Lave fell among the mire
Hes dead enough said John

The victor to the castle hied
And there in tears he found the bride
Thou art my own said John

That night forgetting all alarms
Again she blest him in her arms
I have her now said John




MAY f3 ASDA
FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER


May Asda is gone to the merry green wood
Like flax was each tress on her temples that stood
Her cheek like the roseleaf that perfumes the air
Her form like the lilystalk graceful and fair

She mournd for her lover Sir Frovin the brave
For he had embarkd on the boisterous wave
And burning to gather the laurels of war
Had saild with King Humble to Orkney afar

At feast and at revel wherever she went
Her thoughts on his perils and dangers were bent
No joy has the heart that loves fondly and dear
No pleasure save when the lovd object is near

May Asda walkd out in the bonny noontide
And roamd where the beeches grew up in their pride
She sat herself down on the green sloping hill
Where livd the Erlpeople f4 and where they live still

Then trembled the turf as she sat in repose
And straight from the mountain three maidens arose
And with them a loom and upon it a woof
As white as the snow when it falls on the roof

Of red shining gold was the fairyloom made
They sang and they dancd and their swift shuttles playd
Their song was of death and their song was of life
It sounded like billows in tumult and strife

They gave her the woof with a sorrowful look
And vanishd like bubbles that burst on the brook
But deep in the mountain was heard a sweet strain
As the lady went home to her bower again

The web was unfinishd she wove and she spun
Nor rested a moment until it was done
And there was enough when the work was complete
To form for a dead man a shirt or a sheet

The heroes returnd from the wellfoughten field
And bore home Sir Frovins corse laid on a shield
Sad sight for the maid but she still was alert
And sewd round the body the funeral shirt

And when she had come to the very last stitch
Her feelings so long suppressd rose to a pitch
The cold clammy sweat from her features outbroke
Death struck her and meekly she bowd to the stroke

She rests with her lover now deep in the grave
And oer them the beeches their mossy boughs wave
There sing the Erlmaidens their ditties aloud
And dance while the merry moon peeps from the cloud




AAGER AND ELIZA
FROM THE OLD DANISH


Have ye heard of bold Sir Aager
How he rode to yonder isle
There he saw the sweet Eliza
Who upon him deignd to smile

There he married sweet Eliza
With her lands and ruddy gold
Wo is me the Monday after
Dead he lay beneath the mould

In her bower sat Eliza
Rent the air with shriek and groan
All which heard the good Sir Aager
Underneath the granite stone

Up his mighty limbs he gatherd
Took the coffin on his back
And to fair Elizas bower
Hastend by the wellknown track

On her chambers lowly portal
With his fingers long and thin
Thrice he tappd and bade Eliza
Straightway let her bridegroom in

Straightway answerd fair Eliza
I will not undo my door
Till I hear thee name sweet Jesus
As thou oft hast done before

Rise O rise my own Eliza
And undo thy chamber door
I can name the name of Jesus
As I once could do before

Up then rose the sweet Eliza
Up she rose and twirld the pin
Straight the chamber door flew open
And the dead man glided in

With her comb she combd his ringlets
For she felt but little fear
On each lock that she adjusted
Fell a hot and briny tear

Listen now my good Sir Aager
Dearest bridegroom all I crave
Is to know how it goes with thee
In that lonely place the grave

Every time that thou rejoicest
And thy breast with pleasure heaves
Then that moment is my coffin
Lind with rose and laurel leaves

Every time that thou art shedding
From thine eyes the briny flood
Then that moment is my coffin
Filld with black and loathsome blood

Heard I not the red cock crowing
Distant far upon the wind
Down to dust the dead are going
And I may not stop behind

Heavens ruddy portals open
Daylight bursts upon my view
Though the word be hard to utter
I must bid thee love adieu

Up his mighty limbs he gatherd
Took the coffin on his back
To the churchyard straight he hastend
By the wellknown beaten track

Up then rose the sweet Eliza
Teardrops on her features stood
While her lover she attended
Through the dark and dreary wood

When they reachd the lone enclosure
Last sad refuge of the dead
From the cheeks of good Sir Aager
All the lovely colour fled

Listen now my sweet Eliza
If my peace be dear to thee
Never then from this time forward
Shed a single tear for me

Turn thy lovely eyes to heaven
Where the stars are beaming pale
Thou canst tell me then for certain
If the night begins to fail

When she turnd her eyes to heaven
All with stars besprinkled oer
In the earth the dead man glided
And she never saw him more

Homeward went the sweet Eliza
Oh her heart was chill and cold
Wo is me the Monday after
Dead she lay beneath the mould




SAINT OLUF
FROM THE OLD DANISH


St Oluf was a mighty king
Who ruld the Northern land
The holy Christian faith he preachd
And taught it sword in hand

St Oluf built a lofty ship
With sails of silk so fair
To Hornelummer I must go
And see whats passing there

O do not go the seamen said
To yonder fatal ground
Where savage Jutts f5 and wicked elves
And demon sprites abound

St Oluf climbd the vessels side
His courage nought could tame
Heave up heave up the anchor straight
Lets go in Jesus name

The cross shall be my faulchion now
The book of God my shield
And armd with them I hope and trust
To make the demons yield

And swift as eagle cleaves the sky
The gallant vessel flew
Direct for Hornelummers rock
Through oceans wavy blue

T was early in the morning tide
When she cast anchor there
And lo the Jutt stood on the cliff
To breathe the morning air

His eyes were like the burning beal
His mouth was all awry
The truth I tell and say he stood
Full twenty cubits high

His beard was like a horses mane
And down his bosom rolld
The claws that fencd his finger ends
Were frightful to behold

I never yet have seen he cried
A ship come near my strand
That here to shore I could not drag
By putting out my hand

The good St Oluf smild thereat
And thus addressd his crew
Now hold your tongues and well observe
What Im about to do

The giant stretchd his mighty arm
The ship was nigh his own
But when St Oluf raisd the cross
He sank kneedeep in stone

Here am I sunk kneedeep in stone
My legs I cannot move
But since my back and fists are free
My might thou yet shalt prove

Be still be still thou noisy guest
Be still for evermore
Become a rock and beetle there
Above the billows hoar

Up started then from out the hill
The demons hoary wife
She cursd the king a thousand times
And brandishd high her knife

Sore wonderd then the little elves
Who sat within the hill
To see their mother all at once
Stand likewise stiff and still

T is done they cried by yonder wight
Who rides upon the waves
Lets wade out to him through the surf
And beat him with our staves

At Hornelummer happend then
What happend neer before
The elfins wishd to leave the hill
And could not find a door

They ran their heads against the wall
And tried to break it through
They could not break the solid rock
But broke their necks in lieu

Now thanks to God and Jesus Christ
And good St Olufs arm
To Hornelummer we can sail
Without mishap or harm




THE HEROES OF DOVREFELD
FROM THE OLD DANISH


On Dovrefeld f6 in Norway
Were once together seen
The twelve heroic brothers
Of Ingeborg the queen

And they were all magicians
Possest of mighty art
Who freely read the Runic
And knew the rhyme by heart f7

The first could turn the lightning
And quench its ruddy gleam
The second with a whisper
Could still the running stream

The third beneath the water
Could dive like any fish
The fourth could get provision
By striking on his dish

The fifth upon the gold harp
So pleasantly could play
That all the men who heard him
Began to dance away

The sixth he had a bugle
And when he blew a blast
The stoutest of his foemen
Would fly before him fast

The seventh unimpeded
Through solid hills could roam
The eighth could walk the ocean
When billows were in foam

The ninth could draw by magic
The fishes from the deep
The tenth was never weary
Nor overcome by sleep

The eleventh bound the dragon
Which crept among the grass
And all he wishd to happen
Was sure to come to pass

The twelfth who was reputed
The wisest of the band
Knew what was going forward
In every foreign land

And now forsooth I tell ye
Who listen to my strain
That such a set of brothers
Will neer be seen again




SVEND VONVED
FROM THE OLD DANISH


Grimm in the preface to his German translation of the Kiaempe Viser
characterizes this Ballad in the following magnificent words

 Seltsam ist das Lied von dem Held Vonved Unter dem Empfang des
 Zauberseegens und mit rathselhaften Worten dass er nie wiederkehre
 oder dann den Tod seines Vaters rachen musse reitet er aus Lange
 sieht er keine Stadt und keinen Menschen dann wer sich ihm entgegen
 stelit den wirft er nieder den Hirten legt er seine Rathsel vor uber
 das edelste und abscheuungswurdigste ubar den Gang der Sonne und die
 Ruhe des Todten wer sie nicht Iost den erschlagt er trotzig sitzt
 er unter den Helden ihre Anerbietungen gefallen ihm nicht er reitet
 heim erschlagt zwolf Zauberweiber die ihm entgegen kommen dann
 seine Mutter endlich zernichtet er auch sein Saitenspiel damit kein
 Wohllaut mehr den wilden Sinn besanftige Es scheint dieses Lied vor
 allen in einer eigenen Bedeutung gedichtet und den Mismuth eines
 zerstorten herumirrenden Gemuths anzuzeigen das seine Rathsel will
 gelost haben es ist die Angst eines Menschen darin ausgedruckt der
 die Flugel die er fuhlt nicht frei bewegen kann und der wenn ihn
 diese Angst peinigt gegen alles auch gegen sein Liebstes wuthen
 muss Dieser Charakter scheint dem Norden gantz eigenthumlich in dem
 seltsamen Leben Konigs Sigurd des Jerusalemfahrers auch in
 Shakspeares Hamlet ist etwas ahnliches

 Singular is the song of the hero Vonved After having received the
 magic blessing he rides out darkly hinting that he must never
 return or have avenged the death of his father For a long time he
 sees no city and no man he then overthrows whomsoever opposes him he
 lays his enigmas before the herdsmen concerning that which is most
 grand and that which is most horrible concerning the course of the
 sun and the repose of the dead he who cannot explain them is
 slaughtered Haughtily he sits among the heroestheir invitations do
 not please himhe rides homeslays twelve sorceresses who come
 against himthen his mother and at last he demolishes his harp so
 that no sweet sound shall in future soften his wild humour This
 song more than any of the rest seems to be composed with a meaning
 of its own and shows the melancholy of a ruined wandering mind
 which will have its enigmas cleared up The anguish of a man is
 expressed therein who cannot move freely the wings which he feels
 and who when this anguish torments him is forced to deal out
 destruction against alleven against his bestbeloved Such a
 character seems to be quite the property of the North In the strange
 life of King Sigurd the wanderer to Jerusalem and likewise in
 Shakspeares Hamlet there is something similar

Svend Vonved sits in his lonely bower
He strikes his harp with a hand of power
His harp returnd a responsive din
Then came his mother hurrying in
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

In came his mother Adeline
And who was she but a queen so fine
Now hark Svend Vonved out must thou ride
And wage stout battle with knights of pride
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Avenge thy fathers untimely end
To me or another thy gold harp lend
This moment boune f8 thee and straight begone
I rede f9 thee do it my own dear son
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved binds his sword to his side
He fain will battle with knights of pride
When may I look for thee once more here
When roast the heifer and spice the beer
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

When stones shall take of themselves a flight
And ravens feathers are woxen f10 white
Then mayst thou expect Svend Vonved home
In all my days I will never come
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

His mother took that in evil part
I hear young gallant that mad thou art
Wherever thou goest on land or sea
Disgrace and shame shall attend on thee
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He kissd her thrice with his lips of fire
Appease O mother appease thine ire
Neer wish me any mischance to know
For thou canst not tell how far I may go
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Then I will bless thee this very day
Thou never shalt perish in any fray
Success shall be in thy courser tall
Success in thyself which is best of all
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Success in thy hand success in thy foot
In struggle with man in battle with brute
The holy God and Saint Drotten f11 dear
Shall guide and watch thee through thy career
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

They both shall take thee beneath their care
Then surely thou never shalt evily fare
See yonder sword of steel so white
No helm nor shield shall resist its bite
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved took up the word again
Ill range the mountain and rove the plain
Peasant and noble Ill wound and slay
All all for my fathers wrong shall pay
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved bound his sword to his side
He fain will battle with knights of pride
So fierce and strange was his whole array
No mortal venturd to cross his way
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

His helm was blinking against the sun
His spurs were clinking his heels upon   
His horse was springing with bridle ringing
While sat the warrior wildly singing
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He rode a day he rode for three
No town nor city he yet could see
Ha said the youth by my fathers hand
There is no city in all this land
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He rode and lilted he rode and sang
Then met he by chance Sir Thule Vang
Sir Thule Vang with his twelve sons bold
All casd in iron the bright and cold
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved took his sword from his side
He fain would battle with knights so tried
The proud Sir Thule he first ran through
And then in succession his sons he slew
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved binds his sword to his side
It lists him farther to ride to ride
He rode along by the grene shaw f12
The Brutecarl f13 there with surprise he saw
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

A wild swine sat on his shoulders broad
Upon his bosom a black bear snord
And about his fingers with hair oerhung
The squirrel sported and weasel clung
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Now Brutecarl yield thy booty to me
Or I will take it by force from thee
Say wilt thou quickly thy beasts forego
Or venture with me to bandy a blow
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Much rather much rather Ill fight with thee
Than thou my booty shouldst get from me
I never was bidden the like to do
Since good King Esmer in fight I slew
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

And didst thou slay King Esmer fine
Why then thou slewest dear father mine
And soon full soon shalt thou pay for him
With the flesh hackt off from thy every limb
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

They drew a circle upon the sward
They both were dour as the rocks are hard
Forsooth I tell you their hearts were steeld
The one to the other no jot would yield
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

They fought for a daythey fought for two
And so on the third they were fain to do
But ere the fourth day reachd the night
The Brutecarl fell and was slain outright
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved binds his sword to his side
Farther and farther he lists to ride
He rode at the foot of a hill so steep
There saw he a herd as he drove the sheep
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Now tell me Herd and tell me fair
Whose are the sheep thou art driving there
And what is rounder than a wheel
And where do they eat the holiest meal
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Where does the fish stand up in the flood
And where is the bird thats redder than blood
Where do they mingle the best best wine
And where with his knights does Vidrik dine
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

There sat the herd he sat in thought
To neer a question he answerd aught
Svend gave him a stroke a stroke so sore
That his lung and his liver came out before
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

On on went he till more sheep he spied
The herd sat too by a deep pits side
Now tell me Herd and tell me fair
Whose are the sheep thou art tending there
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

See yonder house with turret and tower
There feasting serves to beguile the hour
There dwells a man Tygge Nold by name
With his twelve fair sons who are knights of fame
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Enough Sir Herd now lend an ear
Go tell Tygge Nold to come out here
From his breast Svend Vonved a gold ring drew
At the foot of the herd the gold ring he threw
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

And as Svend Vonved approachd the spot
His booty among them they gan to allot
Some would have his polishd glaive
Others his harness or courser brave
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved stops in reflection deep
He thought it best he his horse should keep
His hauberk and faulchion he will not lose
Much rather to fight the youth will choose
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Hadst thou twelve sons to the twelve thou hast
And camst in the midst of them charging me fast
Sooner shouldst thou wring water from steel
Than thou in such fashion with me shouldst deal
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He prickd with his spur his courser tall
Which sprang at once over the gate and wall
Tygge Nold there he has stretchd in blood
And his twelve sons too that beside him stood
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Then turnd he his steed in haste about
Svend Vonved the knight so youthful and stout
Forward he went oer mountain and moor
No mortal he met which vexd him sore
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He came at length to another flock
Where a herd sat combing his yellow lock
Now listen Herd with the fleecy care
Listen and give me answers fair
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

What is rounder than a wheel
Where do they eat the holiest meal
Where does the sun go down to his seat
And where do they lay the dead mans feet
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

What fills the valleys one and all
What is clothd best in the monarchs hall
What cries more loud than cranes can cry
And what can in whiteness the swan outvie
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Who on his back his beard does wear
Who neath his chin his nose does bear
Whats more black than the blackest sloe
And what is swifter than a roe
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Where is the bridge that is most broad
What is by man the most abhorrd
Where leads where leads the highest road up
And say where the hottest of drink they sup
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

The sun is rounder than a wheel
They eat at the altar the holiest meal
The sun in the West goes down to his seat
And they lay to the East the dead mans feet
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Snow fills the valleys one and all
Man is clothd best in the monarchs hall
Thunder cries louder than cranes can cry
Angels in whiteness the swan outvie
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

His beard on his back the lapwing wears
His nose neath his chin the elfin bears f14
More black is sin than the blackest sloe
And thought is swifter than any roe
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Ice is of bridges the bridge most broad
The toad is of all things the most abhorrd
To paradise leads the highest road up
And in hell the hottest of drink they sup
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Now hast thou given me answers fair
To each and all of my questions rare
And now I pray thee be my guide
To the nearest spot where warriors bide
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

To Sonderborg Ill show thee straight
Where drink the heroes early and late
There thou wilt find of knights a crew
Haughty of heart and hard to subdue
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

With a bright gold ring was his arm arrayd
Full fifteen pounds that gold ring weighd
That has he given the herd for a meed
Because he will show him the knights with speed
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved enterd the castle yard
There Randulph wrapt in his skins f15 kept guard
Ho Caitiff ho with shield and brand
What art thou doing in this my land
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

I will I will with my single hand
Take from thee Knave the whole of thy land
I will I will with my single toe
Lay thee and each of thy castles low
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Thou shalt not with thy single hand
Take from me Hound an inch of my land
And far far less shalt thou with thy toe
Lay me or one of my castles low
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Thou shalt not eer with finger of thine
Strike asunder one limb of mine f16
I am for thee too woxen and stark
As thou to thy cost shalt quickly mark
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved unsheathd his faulchion bright
With haughty Randulph he fain will fight
Randulph he there has slain in his might
And Strandulph too with full good right
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

The rest against him came out pellmell
Then slew he Carl Ege the fierce and fell
He slew the great he slew the small
He slew till his foes were slaughterd all
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved binds his sword to his side
It lists him farther to ride to ride
He found upon the desolate wold
A burly f17 knight of aspect bold
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Now tell me Rider noble and good
Where does the fish stand up in the flood
Where do they mingle the best best wine
And where with his knights does Vidrik dine
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

The fish in the East stands up in the flood
They drink in the North the wine so good
In Hallands hall does Vidrik dine
With his swains around and his warriors fine
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

From his breast Svend Vonved a gold ring drew
At the foot of the knight the gold ring he threw
Go say thou wert the very last man
Who gold from the hand of Svend Vonved wan
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved came where the castle rose
He bade the watchmen the gate unclose
As none of the watchmen obeyd his cry
He sprang at once over the ramparts high
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He tied his steed to a ring in the wall
Then in he went to the wide stone hall
Down he sat at the head of the board
To no one present he utterd a word
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He drank and he ate he ate and he drank
He askd no leave and returnd no thank
Neer have I been on Christian ground
Where so many curst tongues were clanging round
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

King Vidrik spoke to good knights three
Go bind that lowering swain for me
Should ye not bind the stranger guest
Ye will not serve me as ye can best
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Shouldst thou send three and twenty times three
And come thyself to lay hold of me
The son of a dog thou wilt still remain
And yet to bind me have tried in vain
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Esmer my father who lies on his bier
And proud Adeline my mother so dear
Oft and strictly have cautiond me
To waste no breath upon hounds like thee
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

And was King Esmer thy fathers name
And Adeline that of his virtuous Dame
Thou art Svend Vonved the stripling wild
My own dear sisters only child
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved wilt thou bide with me here
Honour awaits thee and costly cheer
Whenever it lists thee abroad to wend
Upon thee shall knights and swains attend
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Silver and gold thou never shalt lack
Or helm to thy head or mail to thy back
But to this and the like he would lend no ear
And home to his mother he now will steer
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Svend Vonved gallopd along the way
To fancies dark was his mind a prey
Riding he enterd the castle yard
Where stood twelve witches wrinkled and scarrd
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

There stood they all with spindle and rok f18
Each over the shinbone gave him a knock
Svend turnd his steed in fury round
The witches he there has hewd to the ground
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

He hewd the witches limb from limb
So little mercy they got from him
His mother came out and was servd the same
Into fifteen pieces he hackt her frame
 Look out look out Svend Vonved

Then in he went to his lonely bower
There drank he the wine the wine of power
His muchlovd harp he playd upon
Till the strings were broken every one
 Look out look out Svend Vonved




THE TOURNAMENT
FROM THE OLD DANISH


This is one of those Ballads which from the days of Arild have been
much sung in Denmark we find in it the names and bearings of most of
those renowned heroes who are mentioned separately in other poems It
divides itself into two partsthe first which treats of the warriors
bearings has a great resemblance to the 178th chapter of the Vilkina
Saga as likewise has the last part wherein the Duel is described to
the 180th and 181st chapters of the same

I cannot here forbear quoting and translating what Anders Sorensen Vedel
the good old Editor of the first Edition of the Kiaempe Viser which
appeared in 1591 says concerning the apparently superhuman performances
of the heroes therein celebrated

 Hvad ellers Kiaempernes Storlemhed Styrke og anden Vilkaar berorer
 som overgaaer de Menneskers der nu leve deres Vaext og Kraft det
 Stykke kan ikke her noksom nu forhandles men skal i den Danske
 Kronikes tredie Bog videligere omtales Thi det jo i Sandhed befindes
 og bevises af adskillige Documenter og Kundskab at disse gamle
 Hellede som de kaldes have levet fast laenger og vaeret mandeligere
 storre staerkere og hoiere end den gemene Mand er som nu lever paa
 denne Dag

 That part which relates to these Warriors size strength or other
 qualities so far surpassing the stature and powers of the men who now
 exist cannot be here sufficiently treated upon but shall be further
 discussed in the third Book of the Danish Chronicles for in truth
 it is discovered and proved from various documents and sources that
 these old heroes as they are called lived much longer and were
 manlier stouter stronger and taller than man at the present day

Six score there were six score and ten
 From Hald that rode that day
And when they came to Brattingsborg
 They pitchd their pavilion gay

King Nilaus stood on the turrets top
 Had all around in sight
Why hold those heroes their lives so cheap
 That it lists them here to fight

Now hear me Sivard Snaresvend
 Far hast thou rovd and wide
Those warriors weapons thou shalt prove
 To their tent thou must straightway ride

It was Sivard Snaresvend
 To the broad tent speeded he then
I greet ye fair in my masters name
 All all ye Dane kings men

Now be not wroth that here I come
 I come as a warrior free
The battle together we soon will prove
 Let me your bearings see

There stands upon the first good shield
 A lion so fierce and stark
With a crown on his head of the ruddy gold
 That is King Dideriks mark

There shine upon the second shield
 A hammer and pincers bright
Them carries Vidrik Verlandson
 Neer gives he quarter in fight

There shines upon the third good shield
 A falcon blazing with gold
And that by Helled Hogan is borne
 No knight than he more bold

There shines upon the fourth good shield
 An eagle and that is red
Is borne by none but Olger the Dane
 He strikes his foemen dead

There shines upon the fifth good shield
 A couchant hawk on a wall
Thats borne by Master Hildebrand
 He tries with heroes a fall

And now comes forth the sixth good shield
 A linden is thereupon
And that by young Sir Humble is borne
 King Abelons eldest son

There shines upon the seventh good shield
 A spur of a fashion so free
And that is borne by Hogan the less
 Because he will foremost be

There shines upon the eighth good shield
 A gray wolf meagre and gaunt
Is borne by youthful Ulf van Jern
 Beware how him you taunt

There shine upon the ninth good shield
 Three arrows and white are they
Are borne by Vidrik Stageson
 And trust that gallant you may

There shines upon the tenth good shield
 A fiddle and neath it a bow
Thats borne by Folker Spillemand
 For drink he will sleep forego

There shines upon the eleventh shield
 A dragon that looks so dire
Is carried by Orm the youthful swain
 He trembles at no mans ire

And now behold the twelfth good shield
 And upon it a burning brand
Is borne by stout Sir Vifferlin
 Through many a princes land

There stands upon the thirteenth shield
 A sprig of the mournful yew
Thats borne by Harrald Griskeson
 And hes a comrade true

There stand upon the fourteenth shield
 A cloak and a mighty staff
And them bore Alsing the stalwart monk
 When he beat his foes to chaff

And now comes forth the fifteenth shield
 And upon it three naked blades
Are borne by good King Esmers sons
 In their wars and furious raids

There stands upon the sixteenth shield
 With coalblack pinion a crow
Thats borne by rich Count Raadengaard
 The dark Runes well can he throw f19

There shines upon the seventeenth shield
 A horse so stately and high
Is borne by Count Sir Guncelin
 Slay slay bide not is his cry

There shine upon the eighteenth shield
 A man and a fierce wild boar
Are borne by the Count of Lidebierg
 His blows fall heavy and sore

There shines upon the nineteenth shield
 A hound at the stretch of his speed
Is borne by Oisten Kiaempe bold
 He risks his neck without heed

There shines upon the twentieth shield
 Among branches a rose so gay
Wherever Sir Nordman comes in war
 He bears bright honour away

There shines on the oneandtwentieth shield
 A vase and of copper t is made
Thats borne by Mogan Sir Olgerson
 He wins broad lands with his blade

And now comes forth the next good shield
 With a sun dispelling the mirk
And that by Asbiorn Milde is borne
 He sets the knights backs at work f20

There shines on the threeandtwentieth shield
 An arm in a manacle bound
And that by Alvor Sir Lange is borne
 To the heroes he hands mead round

Now comes the fourandtwentieth shield
 And a bright sword there you see
And that by Humble Sir Jerfing is borne
 Full worthy of that is he

There shines upon the next good shield
 A gosshawk striking his game
Thats borne by a knight the best of all
 Sir Iver Blaa is his name

Now comes the sixandtwentieth shield
 A javlin there you spy
Is borne by little Mimring Tan
 From no one will he fly

Such knights and bearings as were there
 And who can them all relate
It was Sivard the Snaresvend
 No longer he deignd to wait

If there be one of the Dane kings men
 Who at Dyst f21 is willing to ride
Let him I pray without pause or delay
 Meet me by the wild woods side

The man among you ye Danish court men
 Who at Dyst has won most meeds
Him I am ready to fight this day
 For both of our noble steeds

The heroes cast the die on the board
 The die it rolld so wide
Since young Sir Humble it stops by thee
 Gainst Sivard thou must ride

Sir Humble struck his hand on the board
 No longer he lists to play
I tell you forsooth that the rosy hue
 From his cheek fast faded away

Now hear me Vidrik Verlandson
 Thou art so free a man
Do lend me Skimming thy horse this day
 Ill pledge for him what I can

Eight good castles in Birtings land
 As pledges for him Ill set
My sister too the lilycheekd maid
 A fairer thou neer hast met

Eight good castles and eight good knights
 Id scorn to offer thee less
If Skimming should meet any hurt this day
 My sister thou shalt caress

If yonder mountains all were gold
 And yonder streams were wine
The whole for Skimming I would not take
 I bless God he is mine

Sivard is a purblind swain
 Sees not to his faulchions end
If Skimming were hurt thou couldst not pay me
 With the help of thy every friend

The sword it whirls in Sivards hand
 As whirl the sails of the mill
If thou take Skimming gainst that wild fool
 T is sorely against my will

Humble he sat him on Skimmings back
 So gallantly can he ride
But Skimming thought it passing strange
 That a spur was clapt to his side

The first course that together they rode
 So strong were the knightly two
Asunder went Humbles saddlering
 And a furlong his good shield flew

Methinks thou art a fair young swain
 And well thy horse canst ride
Dismount thee straight and gird up thy steed
 I am willing for thee to bide

The second course that together they rode
 Was worthy of knights renownd
Then both their saddles burst in two
 And Humble was sent to the ground

Now have I cast thee from thy steed
 Thy courser by right is mine
But tell me youthful and gallant swain
 Who art thou and of what line

Now have I won from thee the prize
 And Skimming belongs to me
But tell me youthful and gallant swain
 What parents gave birth to thee

Abelon is my fathers name
 He sits upon Birtings throne
Queen Ellina my mother is
 And that for truth is known

Queen Ellina my mother is
 A Queen whom all admire
Good King Abelon Haardestaal
 So call they my hoary sire

And who am I but Humble the young
 A knight of Birtings land
Of hero race whose fame extends
 To the wide earths farthest strand

If Abelon be thy fathers name
 The courser I straight restore
Thou art I find my very good friend
 I knew thee not youth before

If Queen Ellina thy mother is
 Then Skimming thou hast rewon
Thou art indeed my very good friend
 Thou art my sisters son

Take both the shield ropes take them straight
 And bind me to yon oak tree
Then hie thee back to King Diderik
 And say thou hast conquerd me

In came Humble the youthful knight
 Was clad in a kirtle green
O I have got my courser again
 And have bound the warrior keen

In came Humble with boot and spur
 He cast on the table his sword
Sivard stands in the green wood bound
 He speaks not a single word

O I have been to the wild forest
 And have seizd the warrior stark
Sivard there was taken by me
 And tied to the oaks rough bark

Now hear me young Sir Humble the knight
 T is plain a jest is meant
Whenever Sivard was bound by thee
 T was done with his own consent

It was Vidrik Verlandson
 And he would fain know all
O I will ride to the wood and see
 How Sivard endures his thrall

Vidrik spoke to his burly groom
 Go saddle me Skimming gray
For I will ride to the wood and hear
 What Sivard himself will say

Sivard stands in the good green wood
 There sees he Vidrik ride
If Vidrik finds me bounden here
 Hell hew my ribbones from my side

Then loud laughd Vidrik Verlandson
 And Skimming began to neigh
For Sivard rooted the oak tree up
 He dard no longer stay

The queen she sat in the high high loft
 And thence lookd far and wide
O there comes Sivard Snaresvend
 With a stately oak at his side

Then loud laughd fair Queen Gloriant
 As she lookd on Sivard full
Thou wert no doubt in great great need
 When thou such flowers didst pull

The King he stood at the castle gate
 In his robes and kingly crown
O there comes Sivard Snaresvend
 And he brings us Summer to townf22

Now dance the heroes by Brattingsborg
 They dance in their coats of felt
There dances Sivard the purblind swain
 With an oak tree under his belt




VIDRIK VERLANDSON
FROM THE OLD DANISH


King Diderik sits in the halls of Bern
 And he boasts of his deeds of might
So many a swain in battle hes felld
 And taken so many a knight

King Diderik sits in the halls of Bern
 And he strikes his moony shield
O would that I knew of a hero now
 Gainst whom I could take the field

Then answerd Master Hildebrand
 For he knew all things best
There sleeps a Giant at Birtingsberg
 Darst thou disturb his rest

Now hear me Master Hildebrand
 Thou art huge in body and limb
Thou foremost shall ride in the wood this day
 And bear our challenge to him

Then answerd Master Hildebrand
 So careful a knight was he
Not so my Lord will I do this day
 For the wages delight not me

Then out spoke Vidrik Verlandson
 And he spoke in wrathful mood
O Ill be first of the band this day
 All through the Birting wood

Then out spoke Vidrik Verlandson
 And he spoke with lofty pride
The smith he forgd me a faulchion good
 That can steel like cloth divide

They were three hundred valorous knights
 Unto Birtings land that rode
They go in quest of Langben the Jutt
 To the gloomy wood his abode

Then out spoke Vidrik Verlandson
 A wondrous game well play
For I will ride in the green wood first
 If yell but trust me away

Then answerd bold King Diderik
 He answerd hastily then
When thou therein shalt have found the Jutt
 Come back for me and my men

It was Vidrik Verlandson
 In the forest alone he sped
And there he found so little a way
 Which up to the Giant led

It was Vidrik Verlandson
 He came unto Birtings hill
There black and dread lay Langben the Jutt
 He lay stretchd out and still

It was Vidrik Verlandson
 With his lance touchd him on the knee
Wake up wake up now Langben the Jutt
 Thou sleepest full sound I see

Here have I lain for many a year
 Mid the leaf and the dewwet herb
But never till now came a warrior by
 That has dard my sleep to disturb

Here stand I Vidrik Verlandson
 With a sword so good at my side
I came to wake thee up from thy sleep
 Betide whatever betide

It was Langben the Giant then
 Turnd up the white of his eye
O whence can come this warrior youth
 Who such bold words lets fly

But hear but hear thou warrior youth
 I will not do battle with thee
Except thou prove of a knightly race
 So thy lineage tell to me

A handsome smith my father was
 And Verland hight was he
Bodild they calld my mother fair
 Queen over countries three

Skimming I call my noble steed
 Begot from the wild seamare
Blank f23 do I call my haughty helm
 Because it glitters so fair

Skrepping I call my good thick shield
 Steel shafts have furrowd it oer
Mimmering have I namd my sword
 T is hardend in heroes gore

And I am Vidrik Verlandson
 For clothes bright iron I wear
Standst thou not up on thy long long legs
 Ill pin thee down to thy lair

Do thou stand up on thy long long legs
 Nor look so dogged and grim
The King holds out before the wood
 Thou shalt yield thy treasure to him

All all the gold that I possess
 I will keep with great renown
Ill yield it at no little horseboys word
 To the best king wearing a crown

So young and little as here I seem
 Thou shalt find me prompt in a fray
Ill hew the head from thy shoulders off
 And thy much gold bear away

It was Langben the mighty Jutt
 With fury his heart was fird
Ride hence ride hence thou warrior youth
 If of life thou be not tird

Skimming sprang up with both his legs
 Against the giants side
Asunder went five of his ribbones then
 And the fight began at that tide

It was Langben the lofty Jutt
 He wavd his steel mace round
He sent a blow after Vidrik
 But the mace struck deep in the ground

It was Langben the lofty Jutt
 Who had thought his foeman to slay
But the blow fell short of Vidrik
 For the good horse bore him away

It was Langben the lofty Jutt
 That shouted in wild despair
Now lies my mace in the hillock fast
 As though t were hammerd in there

Vidrik pausd no moments space
 So ready was he to assail
Upon him Skimming upon him once more
 Now Mimmering now prevail

He seizd his sword in both his hands
 Unto Langben Giant he flew
He struck him so hard in the hairy breast
 That the point his lungs went through

Now Langben Giant has got a wound
 And hes wakend thoroughly now
So gladly would he have paid it back
 But alas he knew not how

Accursed be thou young Vidrik
 And accursd thy piercing steel
Thou hast given me see a wound in my breast
 Whence rise the pains I feel

Ill hew thee Giant Ill hew thee as small
 As leaves that are borne on the blast
Except thou showest me all the gear
 That hid in the forest thou hast

Forbear O Vidrik Verlandson
 Strike me not cruelly dead
And I will lead thee straight to my house
 Thats thatchd with gold so red

Vidrik rode and the Giant crept
 So far through the forest ways
They found the house with the red gold thatchd
 It glitterd like straw in a blaze

Therein therein are heaps of gold
 No King has a greater store
Do thou remove the big black stone
 And lift from the hinges the door

With both hands Vidrik seizd the stone
 But to stir it in vain did he try
The Giant took it with finger and thumb
 And lifted it up in the sky

Now hear now hear thou warrior youth
 Thou canst wheel thy courser about
But in every feat of manly strength
 I could beat thee out and out

Then answerd Vidrik Verlandson
 He feard for himself some ill
T is not the custom of any wise man
 His strength on a stone to spill

Therein therein is much more gold
 Than fifteen kings can show
Hear me Vidrik Verlandson
 Thou therein first shalt go

Then answerd Vidrik Verlandson
 For his cunning intent he saw
Thou shalt lead the way into thine own house
 For that is warriorlaw

It was Langben the Giant then
 To the door he stoopd down low
It was Vidrik Verlandson
 Cleft off his head at a blow

Away the quivering body he drew
 And proppd it against an oak
Then back he rode the long long way
 Hes thought of a wondrous joke

With giants blood he besmeard himself
 And besmeard his steed all oer
Then back he rides to King Diderik
 Pretends to be wounded sore

Here bide ye in peace my companions good
 All under the grassgreen hill
Langben the Giant has smote me to day
 I doubt I shall fare but ill

If thou from the Giant hast got a blow
 Thy life must be nigh its close
Well ride swift back to the halls of Bern
 No man more will we lose

Now wend thee bold King Diderik
 Wend into the wood with me
And all the gold that the giant had
 That will I show to thee

If thou hast slain the giant this day
 T will far be blazd in the land
And the warrior lives not in this world
 Gainst whom thou mayst fear to stand

But what befel King Dideriks men
 When the giant they first perceivd
They all stoppd short in the good green wood
 Of courage at once bereavd

They thought the giant verily would
 That moment after them stride
Not one of them all would have battled with him
 Back would they all have hied

It was Vidrik Verlandson
 He laughd at their craven fear
How would ye have facd him when alive
 Ye dare not him dead go near

With his lances haft the body he pushd
 The head came toppling down
That the Giant was a warrior stark
 Forsooth I am forcd to own

Out took they then his ruddy gold
 And shard it amongst the band
To Vidrik came the largest part
 For t was earnd with his good hand

Little card he for the booty I ween
 But he thought of his meed of fame
When men should say in the Danish land
 That the Giant he overcame

So gladly rode they to Bern again
 King Diderik gladdest of all
There causd he Vidrik Verlandson
 To sit next him in the hall




ELVIR HILL
FROM THE OLD DANISH


Upon this Ballad Oehlenslaeger founded his Elvir Shades a translation
of which has already been given

I rested my head upon Elvir Hills side and my eyes were beginning to
slumber
That moment there rose up before me two maids whose charms would take
ages to number

One patted my face and the other exclaimd while loading my cheek with
her kisses
Rise rise for to dance with you here we have sped from the undermost
caves and abysses

Rise fairheaded swain and refuse not to dance and I and my sister
will sing thee
The loveliest ditties that ever were heard and the prettiest presents
will bring thee

Then both of them sang so delightful a song that the boisterous river
before us
Stood suddenly quiet and placid as though t were afraid to disturb the
sweet chorus

The boisterous stream stood suddenly still though accustomd to foam and
to bellow
And fearless the trout playd along with the pike and the pike playd
with him as his fellow

The fishes whose dwelling was deep in the flood up up from their
caverns did sally
The gay little birds of the forest began to warble forthwith in the
valley

Now listen thou fairheaded swain and if thou wilt stand up and dance
for a minute
Well teach thee to open the sorcerers book and to read all the Runic
thats in it

The bear and the wolf thou shalt trammel unto the thick stem of the
oak at thy pleasure
Before thee the dragon shall fly from his nest and shall leave thee sole
lord of his treasure

Then about and around on the moonlight hill in their fairy fashion they
sported
While unmovd sat the gallant and fair young swain whom they in their
wantonness courted

And wilt thou not grant us our civil request proud stripling and wilt
thou deny it
By hells ruddy blazes our goldhandled knife shall lay thee for ever in
quiet

And if my good luck had not managd it so that the cock crew out then
in the distance
I should have been murderd by them on the hill without power to offer
resistance

T is therefore I counsel each young Danish swain who may ride in the
forest so dreary
Neer to lay down upon lone Elvir Hill though he chance to be ever so
weary




WALDEMARS CHASE


The following Ballad is merely a versification of one of the many feats
of Waldemar the famed phantom hunter of the North an account of whom
and of Palnatoka and Groon the Jutt both spectres of a similar
character may be found in Thieles Danske Folkesagn

Late at eve they were toiling on Harribee bank
 For in harvest men neer should be idle
Towards them rode Waldemar meagre and lank
 And he lingerd and drew up his bridle

Success to your labour and have ye to night
 Seen any thing pass ye while reaping
Yes yes said a peasant I saw something white
 Just now through the cornstubble creeping

Which way did it go Why methought to the beach
 Then off went Waldemar bounding
A few minutes after they heard a faint screech
 And the horn of the hunter resounding

Then back came he laughing in horrible tone
 And the blood in their veins ran the colder
When they saw that a freshslaughterd mermaid was thrown
 Athwart his proud barbs dappled shoulder

Said he I have chasd her for seven score years
 As she landed to drink at the fountains
No more did he deign to their terrified ears
 But gallopd away to the mountains




THE MERMAN
FROM THE OLD DANISH


Do thou dear Mother contrive amain
How Marsk Stigs daughter I may gain

She made him of water a noble steed
Whose trappings were formd from rush and reed

To a young knight changd she then her son
To Marys church at full speed hes gone

His foaming horse to the gate he bound
And pacd the church full three times round

When in he walkd with his plume on high
The dead men gave from their tombs a sigh

The priest heard that and he closd his book
Methinks yon knight has a strange wild look

Then laughd the maiden beneath her sleeve
If he were my husband I should not grieve

He steppd over benches one and two
O Marsk Stigs daughter I doat on you

He steppd over benches two and three
O Marsk Stigs daughter come home with me

Then said the maid without more ado
Here take my troth I will go with you

They went from the church a bridal train
And dancd so gaily across the plain

They dancd till they came to the strand and then
They were forsaken by maids and men

Now Marsk Stigs daughter sit down and rest
To build a boat I will do my best

He built a boat of the whitest sand
And away they went from the smiling land

But when they had crossd the ninth green wave
Down sunk the boat to the ocean cave

I caution ye maids as well as I can
Neer give your troth to an unknown man




THE DECEIVED MERMAN
FROM THE OLD DANISH


Fair Agnes alone on the seashore stood
Then rose a Merman from out the flood

Now Agnes hear what I say to thee
Wilt thou my leman consent to be

O freely that will I become
If thou but take me beneath the foam

He stoppd her ears and he stoppd her eyes
And into the ocean he took his prize

The Mermans leman was Agnes there
She bore him sons and daughters fair

One day by the cradle she sat and sang
Then heard she above how the church bells rang

She went to the Merman and kissd his brow
Once more to church I would gladly go

And thou to church once more shalt go
But come to thy babes back here below

He flung his arm her body around
And he lifted her up unto Englands ground

Fair Agnes in at the church door steppd
Behind her mother who sorely wept

O Agnes Agnes daughter dear
Where hast thou been this many a year

O I have been deep deep under the sea
And livd with the Merman in love and glee

And what for thy honour did he give thee
When he made thee his leman beneath the sea

He gave me silver he gave me gold
And sprigs of coral my hair to hold

The Merman up to the church door came
His eyes they shone like a yellow flame

His face was white and his beard was green
A fairer demon was never seen

Now Agnes Agnes list to me
Thy babes are longing so after thee

I cannot come yet here must I stay
Until the priest shall have said his say

And when the priest had said his say
She thought with her mother at home shed stay

O Agnes Agnes list to me
Thy babes are sorrowing after thee

Let them sorrow and sorrow their fill
But back to them never return I will

Think on them Agnes think on them all
Think on the great one think on the small

Little O little care I for them all
Or for the great one or for the small

O bitterly then did the Merman weep
He hied him back to the foamy deep

But often his shrieks and mournful cries
At midnights hour from thence arise




MISCELLANIES


CANTATA


This is Denmarks holyday
 Dance ye maidens
 Sing ye men
 Tune ye harpers
 Blush ye heroes
This is Denmarks holyday


ONE VOICE


In rights enjoyment in the arm of love
Beneath the olives shadow
The Daneman sat
Whilst wet and steaming wavd the bloody flag
Above the regions of the sunny South
Pure was our heaven
Pure and blue
For with his pinions angel Peace dispelld
All reek and vapour from mild virtues sphere
Then lowerd Battles bloodbespatterd son
Upon our coast
And haggard Envy lent to him her torch
Which sparkled high with hells sulphureous light
Then fled the genius of peace and wept


A SECOND VOICE


But mighty thunders peald the earth it shook
While rattled all the mossgrown giant stones f24
And Oldoms sunken gravehill raisd itself
Then started Skiold and Frode
And Svend and Knud and Waldemar f25
In copper hauberks up and pointing to
Rustspots of blood on faulchion and on shield
They vanishd
And in the Gothic aisles high archd and dim
Wild flutterd of itself the ancient banner
Which hung above a heros bones
The faulchion clatterd loud and ceaselessly
Within the tomb of Christian the Fourth f26
By Tordenskiolds f27 chapel on the strand
Wild rose the daring Mermaids witching song
The stones were loosend round about the grave
Where lay great Juul
And Hvidtfeld clad in a transparent mist
With smiles cherubic beaming on his face
Strayd arm in arm with his heroic brothers
Along the deep


CHORUS


We felt the presence of one and all
The old flags wavd in the arsenal
A wondrous spirit went round went round
The Northern ground


ONE VOICE


Then wakend Thor f28
And drew around his loins the mighty belt
Of bearsinews
With love fraternal hardend he his shield
With eager haste he sharpd his blunted glaive
And with the iron of his hammer touchd
Each Danes and every Normans breast
Shot his heroic flame therein and smild


MANY VOICES


And Denmark and Norway smild


LOUD CHORUS


Upon the water
 Upon the land
We bound for slaughter
 At Thors command


MAIDENS


Then fell our tears so quickly
We breathd we breathd so thickly
While scarce our lips could stammer forth
Prayers for you and for the North


MATRONS


And we and we with breasts that smarted
 Knelt lowly knelt whilst firm ye stood
From us and from affection parted
 In reek and smoke in brothers blood


CHORUS OF MEN


Tenderness comes from God
 Woman and man in its praise should sing
But tenderness flies at honours nod
 We offer all up to our land and King


ONE VOICE


What sang ye warlike throngs
 Repeat repeat this day
One of the simple nervous songs
Ye murmurd out when hot with wrongs
 Ye waited the coming fray


UNIVERSAL CHORUS


We love we all love thee beneficent Peace c


SOLO


Like the wave of the wild North main
Foaming and frothing came on our foe
Proud of his triumphs proud of his train
He thought to lay us low
But from Denmarks lines of oak
A horrible horrible volley outbroke
Then tumbled his mast
His courage fell fast
And the wave which resembled his furious mood
Was now with his blood embrued


CHORUS


This is Denmarks holyday
 Dance ye maidens
 Sing ye men
 Tune ye harpers
 Blush ye heroes
This is Denmarks holyday


A VOICE


But hark what sobbing and what mournful notes
Are mixing with our hymns of ardent joy
Hush hush be still
A band of whiterobd maids approaches slow
With lily chaplets round their yellow locks
With heavy teardrops in their sunken eye
Broken and trembling sounds
The melancholy song
Accompanied by harptones rising mild


YOUTHFUL MAIDENS


Love with rosy fetter
 Held us firmly bound
Pure unmixd enjoyment
 Grateful here we found
Bosom bosom meeting
 Gainst our youths we pressd
Bright the moon arose then
 Glad to see us blest

Denmarks honour beckond
 Loud the canon roard
Perishd in the battle
 They whom we adord
Sweet is grave thy slumber
 Free from care and noise
Short are earthly sorrows
 Endless heavens joys


SUDDEN CHORUS OF THE SLAIN WARRIORS IS HEARD FROM ON HIGH


From the heavenly clear invisible home
Our voices come
No joy can resemble the joy which reigns
In our seraph veins
Lovd ones lovd ones weep for us not
Soon shall ye here partake of our lot
High oer the stars extremest line
The sun of affection more bright shall shine
Brothers brothers t is sweet to die
For the land of our birth and the maid of our eye
Blest are ye who like us shall fall
The righteous Jehovah rewards above
Courage and love
Hallelujah peace be with you all



THE HAILSTORM
FROM THE NORSE


Sigvald Jarl was a famous Sea Rover who when unengaged in his predatory
expeditions resided at Jomsborg in Denmark He was the terror of the
Norwegian coasts which he ravaged and pillaged almost at his pleasure
Hacon Jarl who at that time sat on the Norwegian throne being informed
that Sigvald meditated a grand descent and knowing that he himself was
unable to oppose him had recourse to his God Thorgerd to whom he
sacrificed his son Erling In what manner Thorgerd assisted him and his
forces when the Danes landed will best be learned from the bold song
which the circumstance gave rise to and which the following is a feeble
attempt to translate

When from our ships we bounded
I heard with fear astounded
The storm of Thorgerds waking
From Northern vapours breaking
With flinty masses blended
Gigantic hail descended
And thick and fiercely rattled
Against us there embattled

To aid the hostile maces
It drifted in our faces
It drifted dealing slaughter
And blood ran out like water
Ran reeking red and horrid
From batterd cheek and forehead
We plied our swords but no men
Can stand gainst hail and foemen

And demon Thorgerd raging
To see us still engaging
Shot downward from the heaven
His shafts of flaming levin
Then sank our brave in numbers
To cold eternal slumbers
There lay the good and gallant
Renownd for warlike talent

Our captain this perceiving
The signal made for leaving
And with his ship departed
Downcast and brokenhearted
War death and consternation
Pursud our embarkation
We did our best but no men
Can stand gainst hail and foemen



THE ELDERWITCH


According to the Danish tradition there is a female Elf in the elder
tree which she leaves every midnight and having strolled among the
fields returns to it before morning

Though tall the oak and firm its stem
 Though far abroad its boughs are spread
 Though high the poplar lifts its head
I have no song for them
 A theme more bright more bright would be
 The winsome winsome elder tree
Beneath whose shade I sit reclind
 It holds a witch within its bark
 A lovely witch who haunts the dark
And fills with love my mind

When ghosts at midnight leave their graves
 And rousd is every phantom thing
 When mermaids rise and sweetly sing
In concert with the waves
 When Palnatoka f29 on his steed
 Pursues the elves across the mead
Or gallops gallops oer the sea
 The witch within the elders bark
 The lovely witch who haunts the dark
Comes out comes out to me

Of leaves the fairies make our bed
 The knight who moulders neath the elm f30
 Starts up with spear and rusted helm
By him the grace is said
 And though her kiss is cold at times
 And does not scent of earthly climes
Though glaring is her eye yet still
 The witch within the elders bark
 The lovely witch who haunts the dark
I prize and ever will

Yet once I lovd a mortal maid
 And gazd enrapturd on her charms
 Oft circled in each others arms
Together here we strayd
 But soon she found a fairer youth
 And I a fairer maid forsooth
And one more true more true to me
 The witch within the elders bark
 The lovely witch who haunts the dark
Has been more true to me



ODE
FROM THE GAELIC


 Is luaimnach mo chodal an nochd

Oh restless to night are my slumbers
Life yet I retain but not gladness
My heart in my bosom is witherd
And sorrow sits heavy upon me
For cold in her gravehill is lying
The maid whom I gazd on so fondly
Whose teeth were like chalk from the quarry
Whose voice was more sweet than harp music
Like foam that subsides on the water
Just where the wild swan has been playing
Like snow by the sunny beam melted
My love thou wert gone on a sudden
Salt tears I let fall in abundance
When memory bringeth before me
That eye like the placid blue heaven
That cheek like the rose in its glory
Sweet object of warmest affection
Why could not thy beauty protect thee
Why sparing so many a thistle
Did Death cut so lovely a blossom
Here pine I forlorn and abandond
Where once I was cheerful and merry
No joy shall eer shine on my visage
Until my last hours arrival
O like the top grain on the cornear
Or like the young pine mong the bushes
Or like the moon mong the stars shining
Wert thou O my love amongst women



BEAR SONG
FROM THE DANISH OF EVALD


The squirrel thats sporting
 Amid the green leaves
Full oft with its rustle
 The hunter deceives
Who startsand believing
 That booty is nigh
His heart for a moment
 With pleasure beats high

Now courage he mutters
 And crouching below
A thundersplit linden
 He waits for his foe
Ha joy to the hunter
 A monstrous bear
Een now is approaching
 And bids me prepare

Hark hark for the monarch
 Of forests ere long
Will breathe out his bellow
 Deepthroated and strong
Thus saying he gazes
 Intently around
But death to his wishes
 Can hear not a sound

Except when at moments
 The wind rising shrill
Wafts boughs from the bushes
 Across the lone hill
Wo worth to thee squirrel
 Amid the green leaves
Full oft thy loud rustle
 The hunter deceives



NATIONAL SONG
FROM THE DANISH OF EVALD


King Christian stood beside the mast
 Smoke mixt with flame
Hung oer his guns that rattled fast
Against the Gothmen as they passd
Then sunk each hostile sail and mast
 In smoke and flame
Fly said the foe fly all that can
Nor wage with Denmarks Christian
 The dread unequal game

Niels Juul lookd out and loudly cried
 Quick nows the time
He hoisted up his banner wide
And fore and aft his foemen plied
And loud above the battle cried
 Quick nows the time
Fly said the foe t is Fortunes rule
To deck the head of Denmarks Juul
 With Glorys wreath sublime

Once Baltic when the muskets knell
 Rang through the sky
Down to thy bosom heroes fell
And gaspd amid the stormy swell
While from the shore a piercing yell
 Rang through the sky
God aids me cried our Tordenskiold
Proud foes ye are but vainly bold
 Strike strike to me or fly

Thou Danish path to fame and might
 Darkrolling wave
Receive a friend who holds as light
The perils of the stormy fight
Who braves like thee the tempests might
 Dark rolling wave
O swiftly bear my bark along
Till crownd with conquest lulld with song
 I reach my bournethe grave



THE OLD OAK


Here have I stood the pride of the park
In winter with snow on my frozen bark
In spring mong the flowers that smiling she spread
And among my own leaves when summer was fled
Three hundred years my top I have raisd
Three hundred years I have sadly gazd
Oer Natures wide extended scene
Oer rushing rivers and meadows green
For though I was always willing to rove
I never could yet my firm foot move

They felld my brother who stood by my side
And flung out his arms so wide so wide
How envy I him for how blest is he
As the keel of a vessel he sails so free
Around the whole of the monstrous earth
But I am still in the place of my birth
I once was too haughty by far to complain
But am become feeble through age and pain
And therefore I often give vent to my woes
When through my branches the wild wind blows

A night like this so calm and clear
I have not seen for many a year
The milkwhite doe and her tender fawn
Are skipping about on the moonlight lawn
And there on the verge of my timeworn root
Two lovers are seated and both are mute
Her arm encircles his youthful neck
For none are present their love to check
This night would almost my sad heart cheer
Had I one hope or one single fear



LINES
TO SIXFOOT THREE


A lad who twenty tongues can talk
And sixty miles a day can walk
Drink at a draught a pint of rum
And then be neither sick nor dumb
Can tune a song and make a verse
And deeds of Northern kings rehearse
Who never will forsake his friend
While he his bony fist can bend
And though averse to brawl and strife
Will fight a Dutchman with a knife
O that is just the lad for me
And such is honest sixfoot three

A braver being neer had birth
Since God first kneaded man from earth
O I have cause to know him well
As Ferroes blackend rocks can tell
Who was it did at Suderoe
The deed no other dard to do
Who was it when the Boff f31 had burst
And whelmd me in its womb accurst
Who was it dashd amid the wave
With frantic zeal my life to save
Who was it flung the rope to me
O who but honest sixfoot three

Who was it taught my willing tongue
The songs that Braga f32 framd and sung
Who was it opd to me the store
Of dark unearthly Runic lore
And taught me to beguile my time
With Denmarks aged and witching rhyme
To rest in thought in Elvir shades
And hear the song of fairy maids
Or climb the top of Dovrefeld
Where magic knights their muster held
Who was it did all this for me
O who but honest sixfoot three

Wherever fate shall bid me roam
Far far from social joy and home
Mid burning Africs desert sands
Or wild Kamschatkas frozen lands
Bit by the poisonloaded breeze
Or blasts which clog with ice the seas
In lowly cot or lordly hall
In beggars rags or robes of pall
Mong robberbands or honest men
In crowded town or forest den
I never will unmindful be
Of what I owe to sixfoot three

That form which moves with giantgrace
That wild though not unhandsome face
That voice which sometimes in its tone
Is softer than the wooddoves moan
At others louder than the storm
Which beats the side of old Cairn Gorm f33
That hand as white as falling snow
Which yet can fell the stoutest foe
And last of all that noble heart
Which neer from honours path would start
Shall never be forgot by me
So farewell honest sixfoot three



NATURES TEMPERAMENTS
FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER


SADNESS


Lo a pallid fleecy vapour
 Far along the East is spread
Every star has quenchd its taper
 Lately glimmering over head
On the leaves that bend so lowly
 Drops of crystal water gleam
Yawning wide the peasant slowly
 Drives afield his sluggish team
Dreary looks the forest lacking
 Song of birds that slumber mute
No rough swain is yet attacking
 With his bill the beechs root
Nights terrific ghostly hour
 Backward through times circle flies
No shrill clock from mossgrown tower
 Bids the dead men wake and rise
Wearied out with midnight riot
 Mystic Nature slumbers now
Mouldering bodies rest in quiet
 Neath their tomblids damp and low
Sad and chill the wind is sighing
 Through the reeds that skirt the pool
All around looks dead or dying
 Wrapt in sorrow clad in dool


GLEE


Roseate colours on heavens high arch
 Are beginning to mix with the blue and the gray
Sol now commences his wonderful march
 And the forests wingd denizens sing from the spray
 Gaily the rose
 Is seen to unclose
 Each of her leaves to the brightening ray
 Waves on the lake
 Rise sparkle and break
O Venus O Venus thy shrine is prepard
 Far down in the valley oerhung by the grove
Where all the day Philomel warbles unscard
 Her silvertond ditty of pleasure and love

Innocence smiling outcarrols the lark
 And the bosom of guilt becomes tranquil again
Nightmares and visions the fiends of the dark
 Have abandond the blood and have flown from the brain
 Higher the sun
 Up heaven has run
 Beaming so fierce that we feel him with pain
 Man herb and flower
 Droop under his power
O Venus O Venus thy shrine is prepard
 Far down in the valley oerhung by the grove
Where all the day Philomel warbles unscard
 Her silvertond ditty of pleasure and love


MADNESS


What darkens what darkenst is heavens high roof
What lightenst is Hecklas flame shooting aloof
The proud the majestic the rugged old Thor
The mightiest giant the North ever saw
Transformd to a mountain stands there in the field
With ice for his corslet and rock for his shield
With thunder for voice and with fire for tongue
He stands there so frightful with vapour oerhung
On that other side of the boisterous sea
Black Vulcan as haughty as ever was he
Stands changd to a mountain calld Etna by name
Which belches continually oceans of flame
Much blood have they spilt and much harm have they done
For both when the ancient religions were gone
Combind their wild strength to destroy the new race
Who were boldly beginning their shrines to deface
O Jesus of Nazareth draw forth the blade
Of vengeance and speed to thy worshippers aid
Beat down the old gods cut asunder their mail
Amenbrother Christians why look ye so pale



THE VIOLETGATHERER
FROM THE DANISH OF OEHLENSLAEGER


Pale the moon her light was shedding
 Oer the landscape far and wide
Calmly bright all ills undreading
 Emma wanderd by my side

Nights sad birds their harsh notes utterd
 Perching low among the trees
Emmas milkwhite kirtle flutterd
 Graceful in the rising breeze

Then in sweetness more than mortal
 Sang a voice a plaintive air
As we passd the churchs portal
 Lo a ghostly form stood there

Emma come thy mothers calling
 Lone I lie in night and gloom
Whilst the sun and moonbeams falling
 Glance upon my marble tomb

Emma stard upon the figure
 Wishd to speak but vainly tried
Pressd my hand with loving vigour
 Trembledfaulterdgaspdand died

Home I bore my luckless maiden
 Home I bore her in despair
Chilly blasts with nightdew laden
 Rustled through her streaming hair

Plunging then amid the forest
 Soon I found the stately tree
Under which when heat was sorest
 She was wont to sit with me

Down my cheek ran tears in fever
 While with axe its stem I cut
Soon it fell and I with lever
 Rolld it straight to Emmas hut

Kissd her oft and love empassiond
 Sung a song in wildest tones
While the oaken boards I fashiond
 Doomd to hide her lovely bones

Thereupon I sought the bower
 Where she kept her single hive
Morning shone on tree and flower
 All around me lookd alive

Stung by bees in thousand places
 Out I took the yellow comb
Emma deckd in all her graces
 Past my vision seemd to roam

Soon of wax I formd a taper
 Oer my love it cast its ray
Till the night came clad in vapour
 When in grave I laid her clay

Deep below me sank the coffin
 While my tears fell fast as rain
Deep it sank and I full often
 Thought to heave it up again

Soon as eer the stars so merry
 Heavens arch next night illumd
Sad I sought the cemetery
 Where my true love lay entombd

Then in sweetness more than mortal
 Sang a voice a plaintive lay
Underneath the churchs portal
 Emma stood in death array

Louis come thy love is calling
 Lone I lie in night and gloom
Whilst the sun and moon beams falling
 Glance upon my lowly tomb

Emma dear I cried in gladness
 Take me too beneath the sod
Leave me not to pine in sadness
 Here on earths detested clod

Death should only strike the hoary
 Yet my Louis thou shalt die
When the stars again in glory
 Shine upon the midnight sky

Tears bedeckd her long eyelashes
 While she kissd my features wan
Then like flame that dies oer ashes
 All at once the maid was gone

Therefore pluck I painted violets
 Which shall strew my lifeless clay
When to night the stars have calld me
 Unto joys that last for aye



ODE TO A MOUNTAINTORRENT
FROM THE GERMAN OF STOLBERG


How lovely art thou in thy tresses of foam
 And yet the warm blood in my bosom grows chill
When yelling thou rollest thee down from thy home
 Mid the boom of the echoing forest and hill

The pinetrees are shakenthey yield to thy shocks
 And spread their vast ruin wide over the ground
The rocks fly before theethou seizest the rocks
 And whirlst them like pebbles contemptuously round

The sunbeams have clothd thee in glorious dyes
 They streak with the tints of the heavenly bow
Those hovering columns of vapour that rise
 Forth from the bubbling cauldron below

But why art thou seeking the oceans dark brine
 If grandeur makes happiness sure it is found
When forth from the depths of the rockgirdled mine
 Thou boundest and all gives response to thy sound

Beware thee O torrent of yonder dark sea
 For there thou must crouch beneath tyrannys rod
Here thou art lonely and lovely and free
 Loud as a thunderpeal strong as a god

True it is pleasant at eve or at noon
 To gaze on the sea and its farwinding bays
When tingd with the light of the wandering moon
 Or red with the gold of the midsummer rays

But torrent what is it what is itbehold
 That lustre as nought but a bait and a snare
What is the summer suns purple and gold
 To him who breathes not in pure freedom the air

Abandon abandon thy headlong career
 But downward thou rushestmy words are in vain
Bethink thee that oftchanging winds domineer
 On the billowy breast of the timeserving main

Then haste not O torrent to yonder dark sea
 For there thou must crouch beneath tyrannys rod
Here thou art lonely and lovely and free
 Loud as a thunderpeal strong as a god



RUNIC VERSES


O the force of Runic verses
 O the mighty strength of song
Cannot baffle all the curses
 Which to mortal state belong

Slaughterd chiefs that buried under
 Heaps of marble long have lain
Song can rend your tomb asunder
 Give ye life and strength again

When around his dying capture
 Fierce the serpent draws his fold
Song can make him wild with rapture
 Straight uncoil and bite the mould

When from keep and battled tower
 Flames to heaven upward strain
Song has oer them greater power
 Than the vapours dropping rain

It can quench the conflagration
 Striding oer the works of art
But nor song nor incantation
 Can appease loves cruel smart

O the force of Runic verses
 O the mighty strength of song
Cannot baffle all the curses
 Which to mortal state belong



THOUGHTS ON DEATH
FROM THE SWEDISH OF C LOHMAN


Perhaps t is folly but still I feel
My heartstrings quiver my senses reel
Thinking how like a fast stream we range
Nearer and nearer to yon dread change
When soul and spirit filter away
And leave nothing better than senseless clay

Yield beauty yield for the grave does gape
And horribly alterd reflects thy shape
For ah think not those childish charms
Will rest unrifled in its cold arms
And think not there that the rose of love
Will bloom on thy features as here above

Let him who roams at vanity fair
In robes that rival the tulips glare
Think on the chaplet of leaves which round
His fading forehead will soon be bound
Think on each dirge the priests will say
When his cold corse is borne away

Let him who seeketh for wealth uncheckd
By fear of labourlet him reflect
The gold he wins will brightly shine
When he has perishd with all his line
Though man may rave and vainly boast
We are but ashes when at the most



BIRDS OF PASSAGE
FROM THE SWEDISH


So hot shines the sun upon Niles yellow stream
 That the palmtrees can save us no more from his beam
Now comes the desire for home in full force
 And Northward our phalanx bends swiftly its course

Now dim underneath us through distance we view
 The green grassy earth and the oceans deep blue
There tempests and frequent disasters arise
 Whilst free and untroubled we wend through the skies

Lo high among mountains a meadow lies spread
 And there we alight and get ready our bed
There hatch we our eggs and beneath the chill pole
 We wait while the summer months over us roll

No hunter desirous to make us his prey
 Invades our lone valley by night or by day
But greenmantled fairies their merry routs hold
 And fearless the pigmy f34 there hammers its gold

But when pallid winter again on the rocks
 Shakes down in a shower the snow from his locks
Then comes the desire for heat in full force
 And Southward our phalanx bends swiftly its course

To the verdant Savannah and palmshaded plain
 Where the Nile rolls his water we hurry again
There rest we till summers sun waxing too hot
 Makes us wish for our native our hillgirded spot



THE BROKEN HARP


O thou who mid the forest trees
 With thy harmonious trembling strain
Couldst change at once to soothing ease
 My lovesick bosoms cruel pain
Thou droopst in dreary silence now
 With shiverd frame and broken string
While here unhelpd beneath the bough
 I sit and feebly strive to sing

The moon no more illumes the ground
 In night and vapour dies my lay
For with thy sweet and melting sound
 Fled all at once her silver ray
O soon O soon shall this sad heart
 Which beats so low and bleeds so free
Oercome by its fell load of smart
 Be broke O ruind harp like thee



SCENES


Observe ye not yon high cliffs brow
Up which a wanderer clambers slow
T is by a hoary ruin crownd
Which rocks when shrill winds whistle round
That is an ancient knightly hold
Alas it droops deserted cold
And sad and cheerless seems to gaze
Back back to yon heroic days
When youthful Kemps f35 completely armd
And lovely maids around it swarmd

You in the tower a hole may see
A window there has ceasd to be
From that once leand a damsel bright
In evenings red and fading light
And stard intently down the way
Up which should come her lover gay
But time it flies on rapid wing
Far off a church is towering
Within it stand two marble stones
That rest above the lovers bones
But see the wanderer with pain
Has reachd the pile he wishd to gain
Whilst Sol behind the ruind walls
Down into sacred nature falls

See there two hostile nobles fight
With tigerrage and giantmight
Theres seen no smoke theres heard no shot
For guns and powder yet were not
T was custom then when foemen warrd
To win or lose with spear and sword
A wild heroic song they yell
And each the other seeks to fell
Oft oft her ownself to destroy
Her own hand nature does employ
There casts the hill up fireflakes
And Earths gigantic body quakes
There lightnings through the high blue flash
And oceans billows wildly dash
There men gainst men their muscles strain
And deal out death and wounds and pain
O Nature to thyself show less
Of hate and more of tenderness

How dusky is the air around
We are no more above the ground
But down we wend within the hill
Whose springs our ears with hissings fill
See there how rich the ruddy gold
Winds snakeways midst the clammy mould
And hard green stone By torches ray
The harvest there men mow away
But see ye not yon gathring cloud
Which gainst them cometh paley proud
That holds the spirit of the hill
Who brings death in its hand so chill
If down they do not quickly fall
Most certainly t will slay them all
For sorely wrathful is its mood
Because they break its solitude
Because its treasure off they bear
And fling light oer its gloomy lair
T is white and Kobbold is the name
Which it from oldest days does claim

Now back at once into time we go
For many a hundred years I trow
A gothic chamber salutes your sight
A taper gleams feebly through the night
A ghostly man by the board you see
With his hand to his temples muses he
Parchments with age discolourd and dun
Ancient shields all written upon
Treebark bearing ciphers half defacd
Stones with Runes and characters gracd
Things of more worth than ye are aware
On the mighty table are pild up there
He gazes now in exstatic trance
Through the casement out into natures expanse
Wheneer we sit at the lone midnight
And stare out into the dubious light
Whilst the pallid moon is peering oer
Ruind cloister and crumbling tower
Feelings so wondrous strange come oer us
The past and the future arise before us
The present fadeth unmarkd away
In the garb of insignificancy
He gazes up into natures height
The noble man with his eye so bright
He gazes up to the starry skies
Whither sooner or later we hope to rise
And now he takes in haste the pen
And the spirit of Oldom flows from it amain
The scatterd Gothsongs he changes unto
An Epic which maketh each bosom to glow
Thanks to the old Monk toiling thus
They call him Saxo Grammaticus

An open field before you lies
A windburst oer its bosom sighs
Now all is still all seems asleep
Midst of the field there stands a heap
Upon the heap stand Runic stones
Thereunder rest gigantic bones
From Arilds time that heap stands there
But now t is tilld with utmost care
In order that its owner may
Thereoff reap golden corn one day
Oft has he tried the niggard soul
The mighty stones away to roll
As useless burdens of his ground
But they for that too big were found
See see the moon through cloud and rack
Looks down upon the letters black
And when the ghost its form uprears
He shines upon its bursting tears
For oh the moons an ancient man
Describe him mortal tongue neer can
He shines alike serene and bright
At midmost hour of witching night
Upon the spot of love and glee
And on the gloomy gallowstree
Upon each Rune behold him stare
While off he hastes through fields of air
He understands those signs Ill gage
Whose meaning lies in sunken age
And if he were in speaking state
No doubt the old man could relate
Strange things that have on earth occurrd
Of which fame neer has said a word
But since with look with look alone
He cannot those events make known
He waketh from his height sublime
Mere longing for the dark gone time



THE SUICIDES GRAVE
FROM THE GERMAN


This piece is not translated for the sentiments which it contains but
for its poetical beauties Although the path of human life is rough and
thorny the mind may always receive consolation by looking forward to the
world to come The mind which rejects a future state has to thank itself
for its utter misery and hopelessness

The evening shadows fall upon the grave
On which I sit it is no common heap
Below its turf are laid the bones of one
Who sick of life and misery did quench
The vital spark which in his bosom burnd

The shadows deepen and the ruddy tinge
Which lately flooded all the western sky
Has now diminishd to a single streak
And here I sit alone and listen to
The noise of forests and the hum of groves

This is the time to think of natures God
When birds and fountains streams and woods unite
Their varioussounding voices in his praise
Shall man alone refuse to sing ityes
For man alone has nought to thank him for

Theres not a joy he gives to us on earth
That is not dashd with bitterness and gall
Only when youth is past and age comes on
Do we find quietquiet is not bliss
Then tell me God what Ive to thank thee for

But to recur to him who rests beneath
He had a heart enthusiastic warm
And formd for loveno prejudice dwelt there
He roamd about the world to find a heart
Which felt with his he sought and found it not

Or if he found it providence steppd in
And tore the cherishd object from his sight
Or filld its mind with visions weak and vain
Could he survive all this ah no he died
Died by the hand which injurd none but him

And did he die unpitied and unwept
Most probably for there are fools who think
T is crime in man to take what is his own
And t was on account they laid him here
Within this sweet unconsecrated spot

There comes a troop of maidens and of youths
Home from their labourhark they cease their song
And pointing to the grave with trembling hands
They make a circuit thinking that in me
The ghost of the selfmurderer they view
Which fame says wanders here

APPENDIX No 1
A Bibliographical Note by Clement Shorter


George Borrow commenced his literary career with a translation of
Klingers Faustus in 1825 and by a compilation of Celebrated Trials
in the same year Both these books appeared in London while he was
engaged as a booksellers hack as described in Lavengro In 1826
Borrow returned to Norwich and there he issued from the printinghouse
of S Wilkin in the Upper Haymarket these Romantic Ballads He had
worked hard at collecting subscribers and two hundred copies were
reserved for Norwich at half a guinea each copy the remaining three
hundred out of an edition of five hundred were sent to London Some of
these bear the imprint of John Taylor Waterloo Place Pall Mall 1826
while the remainder bear the imprint of Wightman  Cramp of Paternoster
Row in the same year Dr Knapp only knew of the Taylor edition
because that is referred to in the correspondence Copies however of
the Wightman  Cramp edition are in existence and the titlepage will be
found reproduced with those of the first and second issue in the opening
pages of this volume Borrow sent copies to Lockhart and Cunningham
advised gifts to other reviewers but not a single review of the book
appeared Yet his subscription list amply paid all expenses as Borrow
states in a letter to Cunningham That list reveals the fact that such
diverse persons as Dr Bathurst Bishop of Norwich and Thurtell the
murderer of Mr Weare were among the Norwich subscribers while Benjamin
Haydon John Timbs and Thomas Campbell paid their halfguineas from
London Thurtell we may add was hanged before the book appeared

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergorgfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
