Preface

THIS volume discloses the mental operations of perhaps the most
thoroughly practical politician of the dayGeorge Washington Plunkitt
Tammany leader of the Fifteenth Assembly District Sachem of the Tammany
Society and Chairman of the Elections Committee of Tammany Hall who
has held the offices of State Senator Assemblyman Police Magistrate
County Supervisor and Alderman and who boasts of his record in filling
four public offices in one year and drawing salaries from three of them
at the same time

The discourses that follow were delivered by him from his rostrum the
bootblack stand in the County Courthouse at various times in the
last halfdozen years Their absolute frankness and vigorous
unconventionality of thought and expression charmed me Plunkitt said
right out what all practical politicians think but are afraid to say
Some of the discourses I published as interviews in the New York Evening
Post the New York Sun the New York World and the Boston Transcript
They were reproduced in newspapers throughout the country and several
of them notably the talks on The Curse of Civil Service Reform and
Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft became subjects of discussion in
the United States Senate and in college lectures There seemed to be
a general recognition of Plunkitt as a striking type of the practical
politician a politician moreover who dared to say publicly what
others in his class whisper among themselves in the City Hall corridors
and the hotel lobbies

I thought it a pity to let Plunkitts revelations of himselfas frank
in their way as Rousseaus Confessionsperish in the files of the
newspapers so I collected the talks I had published added several new
ones and now give to the world in this volume a system of political
philosophy which is as unique as it is refreshing

No New Yorker needs to be informed who George Washington Plunkitt is
For the information of others the following sketch of his career is
given He was born as he proudly tells in Central Parkthat is in
the territory now included in the park He began life as a driver of
a cart then became a butchers boy and later went into the butcher
business for himself How he entered politics he explains in one of his
discourses His advancement was rapid He was in the Assembly soon after
he cast his first vote and has held office most of the time for forty
years

In 1870 through a strange combination of circumstances he held the
places of Assemblyman Alderman Police Magistrate and County Supervisor
and drew three salaries at oncea record unexampled in New York
politics

Plunkitt is now a millionaire He owes his fortune mainly to his
political pull as he confesses in Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft
He is in the contracting transportation real estate and every
other business out of which he can make money He has no office His
headquarters is the County Courthouse bootblack stand There he receives
his constituents transacts his general business and pours forth his
philosophy

Plunkitt has been one of the great powers in Tammany Hall for a quarter
of a century While he was in the Assembly and the State Senate he
was one of the most influential members and introduced the bills that
provided for the outlying parks of New York City the Harlem River
Speedway the Washington Bridge the 155th Street Viaduct the grading
of Eighth Avenue north of Fiftyseventh Street additions to the Museum
of Natural History the West Side Court and many other important public
improvements He is one of the closest friends and most valued advisers
of Charles F Murphy leader of Tammany Hall

A Tribute to Plunkitt by the Leader of Tammany Hall

SENATOR PLUNKITT is a straight organization man He believes in party
government he does not indulge in cant and hypocrisy and he is never
afraid to say exactly what he thinks He is a believer in thorough
political organization and alltheyeararound work and he holds to the
doctrine that in making appointments to office party workers should
be preferred if they are fitted to perform the duties of the office
Plunkitt is one of the veteran leaders of the organization he has
always been faithful and reliable and he has performed valuable
services for Tammany Hall

PLUNKITT OF TAMMANY HALL



Chapter 1 Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft

EVERYBODY is talkin these days about Tammany men growin rich on graft
but nobody thinks of drawin the distinction between honest graft and
dishonest graft Theres all the difference in the world between the
two Yes many of our men have grown rich in politics I have myself
Ive made a big fortune out of the game and Im gettin richer every
day but Ive not gone in for dishonest graftblackmailin gamblers
saloonkeepers disorderly people etcand neither has any of the men
who have made big fortunes in politics

Theres an honest graft and Im an example of how it works I might sum
up the whole thing by sayin I seen my opportunities and I took em

Just let me explain by examples My partys in power in the city and
its goin to undertake a lot of public improvements Well Im tipped
off say that theyre going to lay out a new park at a certain place

I see my opportunity and I take it I go to that place and I buy up all
the land I can in the neighborhood Then the board of this or that makes
its plan public and there is a rush to get my land which nobody cared
particular for before

Aint it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on my
investment and foresight Of course it is Well thats honest graft

Or supposin its a new bridge theyre goin to build I get tipped off
and I buy as much property as I can that has to be taken for approaches
I sell at my own price later on and drop some more money in the bank

Wouldnt you Its just like lookin ahead in Wall Street or in the
coffee or cotton market Its honest graft and Im lookin for it every
day in the year I will tell you frankly that Ive got a good lot of it
too

Ill tell you of one case They were goin to fix up a big park no
matter where I got on to it and went lookin about for land in that
neighborhood

I could get nothin at a bargain but a big piece of swamp but I took it
fast enough and held on to it What turned out was just what I counted
on They couldnt make the park complete without Plunkitts swamp and
they had to pay a good price for it Anything dishonest in that

Up in the watershed I made some money too I bought up several bits of
land there some years ago and made a pretty good guess that they would
be bought up for water purposes later by the city

Somehow I always guessed about right and shouldnt I enjoy the
profit of my foresight It was rather amusin when the condemnation
commissioners came along and found piece after piece of the land in the
name of George Plunkitt of the Fifteenth Assembly District New York
City They wondered how I knew just what to buy The answer isI
seen my opportunity and I took it I havent confined myself to land
anything that pays is in my line

For instance the city is repavin a street and has several hundred
thousand old granite blocks to sell I am on hand to buy and I know
just what they are worth

How Never mind that I had a sort of monopoly of this business for a
while but once a newspaper tried to do me It got some outside men to
come over from Brooklyn and New Jersey to bid against me

Was I done Not much I went to each of the men and said How many of
these 250000 stories do you want One said 20000 and another wanted
15000 and other wanted 10000 I said All right let me bid for the
lot and Ill give each of you all you want for nothin

They agreed of course Then the auctioneer yelled How much am I bid
for these 250000 fine pavin stones

Two dollars and fifty cents says I

Two dollars and fifty cents screamed the auctioneer Oh thats a
joke Give me a real bid

He found the bid was real enough My rivals stood silent I got the
lot for 250 and gave them their share Thats how the attempt to do
Plunkitt ended and thats how all such attempts end

Ive told you how I got rich by honest graft Now let me tell you that
most politicians who are accused of robbin the city get rich the same
way

They didnt steal a dollar from the city treasury They just seen their
opportunities and took them That is why when a reform administration
comes in and spends a half million dollars in tryin to find the public
robberies they talked about in the campaign they dont find them

The books are always all right The money in the city treasury is all
right Everything is all right All they can show is that the Tammany
heads of departments looked after their friends within the law and
gave them what opportunities they could to make honest graft Now let
me tell you thats never goin to hurt Tammany with the people Every
good man looks after his friends and any man who doesnt isnt likely
to be popular If I have a good thing to hand out in private life I
give it to a friendWhy shouldnt I do the same in public life

Another kind of honest graft Tammany has raised a good many salaries
There was an awful howl by the reformers but dont you know that
Tammany gains ten votes for every one it lost by salary raisin

The Wall Street banker thinks it shameful to raise a department clerks
salary from 1500 to 1800 a year but every man who draws a salary
himself says Thats all right I wish it was me And he feels
very much like votin the Tammany ticket on election day just out of
sympathy

Tammany was beat in 1901 because the people were deceived into believin
that it worked dishonest graft They didnt draw a distinction between
dishonest and honest graft but they saw that some Tammany men grew
rich and supposed they had been robbin the city treasury or levyin
blackmail on disorderly houses or workin in with the gamblers and
lawbreakers

As a matter of policy if nothing else why should the Tammany leaders
go into such dirty business when there is so much honest graft lyin
around when they are in power Did you ever consider that

Now in conclusion I want to say that I dont own a dishonest dollar
If my worst enemy was given the job of writin my epitaph when Im gone
he couldnt do more than write

George W Plunkitt He Seen His Opportunities and He Took Em

Chapter 2 How to Become a Statesman

THERES thousands of young men in this city who will go to the polls for
the first time next November Among them will be many who have watched
the careers of successful men in politics and who are longin to make
names and fortunes for themselves at the same gameIt is to these
youths that I want to give advice First let me say that I am in a
position to give what the courts call expert testimony on the subject I
dont think you can easily find a better example than I am of success
in politics After forty years experience at the game I amwell Im
George Washington Plunkitt Everybody knows what figure I cut in the
greatest organization on earth and if you hear people say that Ive
laid away a million or so since I was a butchers boy in Washington
Market dont come to me for an indignant denial Im pretty comfortable
thank you

Now havin qualified as an expert as the lawyers say I am goin to
give advice free to the young men who are goin to cast their first
votes and who are lookin forward to political glory and lots of cash
Some young men think they can learn how to be successful in politics
from books and they cram their heads with all sorts of college rot
They couldnt make a bigger mistake Now understand me I aint sayin
nothin against colleges I guess theyll have to exist as long as
theres bookworms and I suppose they do some good in a certain way
but they dont count in politics In fact a young man who has gone
through the college course is handicapped at the outset He may succeed
in politics but the chances are 100 to 1 against him

Another mistake some young men think that the best way to prepare for
the political game is to practice speakin and becomin orators Thats
all wrong Weve got some orators in Tammany Hall but theyre chiefly
ornamental You never heard of Charlie Murphy delivering a speech did
you Or Richard Croker or John Kelly or any other man who has been a
real power in the organization Look at the thirtysix district leaders
of Tammany Hall today How many of them travel on their tongues Maybe
one or two and they dont count when business is doin at Tammany
Hall The men who rule have practiced keepin their tongues still not
exercisin them So you want to drop the orator idea unless you mean to
go into politics just to perform the skyrocket act

Now Ive told you what not to do I guess I can explain best what to
do to succeed in politics by tellin you what I did After goin through
the apprenticeship of the business while I was a boy by workin around
the district headquarters and hustlin about the polls on election day
I set out when I cast my first vote to win fame and money in New York
City politics Did I offer my services to the district leader as a
stumpspeaker Not much The woods are always full of speakers Did
I get up a hook on municipal government and show it to the leader I
wasnt such a fool What I did was to get some marketable goods before
goin to the leaders What do I mean by marketable goods Let me tell
you I had a cousin a young man who didnt take any particular
interest in politics I went to him and said Tommy Im goin to be a
politician and I want to get a followin can I count on you He said
Sure George Thats how I started in business I got a marketable
commodityone vote Then I went to the district leader and told him
I could command two votes on election day Tommys and my own He
smiled on me and told me to go ahead If I had offered him a speech or a
bookful of learnin he would have said Oh forget it

That was beginnin business in a small way wasnt it But that is the
only way to become a real lastin statesman I soon branched out Two
young men in the flat next to mine were school friendsI went to them
just as I went to Tommy and they agreed to stand by me Then I had a
followin of three voters and I began to get a bit chesty Whenever I
dropped into district headquarters everybody shook hands with me and
the leader one day honored me by lightin a match for my cigar And so
it went on like a snowball rollin down a hill I worked the flathouse
that I lived in from the basement to the top floor and I got about a
dozen young men to follow me Then I tackled the next house and so on
down the block and around the corner Before long I had sixty men back
of me and formed the George Washington Plunkitt Association

What did the district leader say then when I called at headquarters I
didnt have to call at headquarters He came after me and said George
what do you want If you dont see what you want ask for it Wouldnt
you like to have a job or two in the departments for your friends
I said Ill think it over I havent yet decided what the George
Washington Plunkitt Association will do in the next campaign You ought
to have seen how I was courted and petted then by the leaders of the
rival organizations I had marketable goods and there was bids for them
from all sides and I was a risin man in politics As time went on
and my association grew I thought I would like to go to the Assembly
1 just had to hint at what I wanted and three different organizations
offered me the nomination Afterwards I went to the Board of Aldermen
then to the State Senate then became leader of the district and so on
up and up till I became a statesman

That is the way and the only way to make a lastin success in politics
If you are goin to cast your first vote next November and want to go
into politics do as I did Get a followin if its only one man
and then go to the district leader and say I want to join the
organization Ive got one man wholl follow me through thick and thin
The leader wont laugh at your oneman followin Hell shake your hand
warmly offer to propose you for membership in his club take you down
to the corner for a drink and ask you to call again But go to him
and say I took first prize at college in Aristotle I can recite all
Shakespeare forwards and backwards there aint nothin in science that
aint as familiar to me as blockades on the elevated roads and Im the
real thing in the way of silvertongued orators What will he answer
Hell probably say I guess you are not to blame for your misfortunes
but we have no use for you here



Chapter 3 The Curse of Civil Service Reform

This civil service law is the biggest fraud of the age It is the curse
of the nation There cant be no real patriotism while it lasts How
are you goin to interest our young men in their country if you have no
offices to give them when they work for their party Just look at things
in this city today There are ten thousand good offices but we cant
get at more than a few hundred of them How are we goin to provide
for the thousands of men who worked for the Tammany ticket It cant be
done These men were full of patriotism a short time ago They expected
to be servin their city but when we tell them that we cant place
them do you think their patriotism is goin to last Not much They
say Whats the use of workin for your country anyhow Theres nothin
in the game And what can they do I dont know but Ill tell you what
I do know I know more than one young man in past years who worked for
the ticket and was just overflowin with patriotism but when he was
knocked out by the civil service humbug he got to hate his country and
became an Anarchist

This aint no exaggeration I have good reason for sayin that most
of the Anarchists in this city today are men who ran up against civil
service examinations Isnt it enough to make a man sour on his country
when he wants to serve it and wont be allowed unless he answers a
lot of fool questions about the number of cubic inches of water in the
Atlantic and the quality of sand in the Sahara desert There was once a
bright young man in my district who tackled one of these examinations
The next I heard of him he had settled down in Herr Mosts saloon
smokin and drinkin beer and talkin socialism all day Before that
time he had never drank anything but whisky I knew what was comm when
a young Irishman drops whisky and takes to beer and long pipes in a
German saloon That young man is today one of the wildest Anarchists in
town And just to think He might be a patriot but for that cussed civil
service

Say did you hear about that Civil Service Reform Association kickin
because the tax commissioners want to put their fiftyfive deputies on
the exempt list and fire the outfit left to them by Low Thats civil
service for you Just think Fiftyfive Republicans and mugwumps holdin
8000 and 4000 and 5000 jobs in the tax department when 1555 good
Tammany men are ready and willin to take their places Its an
outrage What did the people mean when they voted for Tammany What
is representative government anyhow Is it all a fake that this is a
government of the people by the people and for the people If it isnt
a fake then why isnt the peoples voice obeyed and Tammany men put in
all the offices

When the people elected Tammany they knew just what they were doin
We didnt put up any false pretenses We didnt go in for humbug
civil service and all that rot We stood as we have always stood for
rewardin the men that won the victory They call that the spoils
system All right Tammany is for the spoils system and when we go in
we fire every antiTammany man from office that can be fired under the
law Its an elastic sort of law and you can bet it will be stretched to
the limit Of course the Republican State Civil Service Board will
stand in the way of our local Civil Service Commission all it can but
saysuppose we carry the State sometime wont we fire the upstate
Board all right Or well make it work in harmony with the local board
and that means that Tammany will get everything in sight I know that
the civil service humbug is stuck into the constitution too but as
Tim Campbell said Whats the constitution among friends

Say the peoples voice is smothered by the cursed civil service law
it is the root of all evil in our government You hear of this thing or
that thing goin wrong in the nation the State or the city Look down
beneath the surface and you can trace everything wrong to civil service
I have studied the subject and I know The civil service humbug is
underminin our institutions and if a halt aint called soon this
great republic will tumble down like a Park Avenue house when they
were buildin the subway and on its ruins will rise another Russian
government

This is an awful serious proposition Free silver and the tariff and
imperialism and the Panama Canal are triflin issues when compared to
it We could worry along without any of these things but civil service
is sappin the foundation of the whole shootin match let me argue it
out for you I aint up on sillygisms but I can give you some arguments
that nobody can answer

First this great and glorious country was built up by political
parties second parties cant hold together if their workers dont
get the offices when they win third if the parties go to pieces the
government they built up must go to pieces too fourth then therell
be h to pay

Could anything be clearer than that Say honest now can you answer
that argument Of course you wont deny that the government was built
up by the great parties Thats history and you cant go back of the
returns As to my second proposition you cant deny that either When
parties cant get offices theyll bust They aint far from the bustin
point now with all this civil service business keepin most of the good
things from them How are you goin to keep up patriotism if this thing
goes On You cant do it Let me tell you that patriotism has been dying
out fast for the last twenty years Before then when a party won
its workers got everything in sight That was somethin to make a man
patriotic Now when a party wins and its men come forward and ask for
their rewards the reply is Nothin doin unless you can answer a
list of questions about Egyptian mummies and how many years it will take
for a bird to wear out a mass of iron as big as the earth by steppin on
it once in a century

I have studied politics and men for fortyfive years and I see how
things are driftin Sad indeed is the change that has come over the
young men even in my district where I try to keep up the fire of
patriotism by gettin a lot of jobs for my constituents whether Tammany
is in or out The boys and men dont get excited any more when they see
a United States flag or hear The StarSpangled Banner They dont care
no more for firecrackers on the Fourth of July And why should they
What is there in it for them They know that no matter how hard they
work for their country in a campaign the jobs will go to fellows who
can tell about the mummies and the bird steppin on the iron Are you
surprised then that the young men of the country are beginnin to look
coldly on the flag and dont care to put up a nickel for firecrackers

15 The Curse of Civil Service Reform

Say let me tell of one caseAfter the battle of San Juan Hill the
Americans found a dead man with a light complexion red hair and blue
eyes They could see he wasnt a Spaniard although he had on a Spanish
uniform Several officers looked him over and then a private of the
Seventyfirst Regiment saw him and yelled Good Lord thats Flaherty
That man grew up in my district and he was once the most patriotic
American boy on the West Side He couldnt see a flag without yellin
himself hoarse

Now how did he come to be lying dead with a Spanish uniform on I found
out all about it and Ill vouch for the story Well in the municipal
campaign of 1897 that young man chockful of patriotism worked day and
night for the Tammany ticket Tammany won and the young man determined
to devote his life to the service of the city He picked out a place
that would suit him and sent in his application to the head of
department He got a reply that he must take a civil service examination
to get the place He didnt know what these examinations were so
he went all lighthearted to the Civil Service Board He read the
questions about the mummies the bird on the iron and all the other
fool questionsand he left that office an enemy of the country that he
had loved so well The mummies and the bird blasted his patriotism He
went to Cuba enlisted in the Spanish army at the breakin out of the
war and died fightin his country

That is but one victim of the infamous civil service If that young man
had not run up against the civil examination but had been allowed to
serve his country as he wished he would be in a good office today
drawin a good salary Ah how many young men have had their patriotism
blasted in the same way

Now what is goin to happen when civil service crushes out patriotism
Only one thing can happen the republic will go to pieces Then a
czar or a sultan will turn up which brings me to the fourthly of my
argumentthat is there will be h to pay And that aint no lie



Chapter 4 Reformers Only Mornin Glories

COLLEGE professors and philosophers who go up in a balloon to think
are always discussin the question Why Reform Administrations Never
Succeed Themselves The reason is plain to anybody who has learned the
a b c of politics

I cant tell just how many of these movements Ive seen started in New
York during my forty years in politics but I can tell you how many have
lasted more than a few yearsnone There have been reform committees
of fifty of sixty of seventy of one hundred and all sorts of numbers
that started Out to do up the regular political Organizations They were
mornin glorieslooked lovely in the mornin and withered up in a short
time while the regular machines went on flourishin forever like
fine old oaks Say thats the first poetry I ever worked off Aint it
great

Just look back a few years You remember the Peoples Municipal League
that nominated Frank Scott for mayor in 1890 Do you remember the
reformers that got up that league Have you ever heard of them since I
havent Scott himself survived because he had always been a firstrate
politician But youd have to look in the newspaper almanacs of 1891 to
find out who made up the Peoples Municipal League Oh yes I remember
one name Ollie Teall dear pretty Ollie and his big dog Theyre about
all thats left of the League

Now take the reform movement of 1894 A lot of good politicians joined
in thatthe Republicans the State Democrats the Stecklerites and the
OBrienites and they gave us a lickin but the real reform part of the
affair the Committee of Seventy that started the thing goin whats
become of those reformers Whats become of Charles Stewart Smith
Wheres Bangs Do you ever hear of Cornell the iron man in politics
now Could a search party find R W G Welling Have you seen the name
of Fulton McMahon or McMahon FultonI aint sure whichin the papers
lately Or Preble Tucker Orbut its no use to go through the list
of the reformers who said they sounded in the death knell of Tammany in
1894 Theyre gone for good and Tammanys pretty well thank you They
did the talkin and posin and the politicians in the movement got all
the plums Its always the case

The Citizens Union has lasted a little bit longer than the reform crowd
that went before them but thats because they learned a thing or two
from us They learned how to put up a pretty good bluffand bluff
Counts a lot in politics With only a few thousand members they had the
nerve to run the whole Fusion movement make the Republicans and other
organizations come to their headquarters to select a ticket and dictate
what every candidate must do or not do I love nerve and Ive had a
sort of respect for the Citizens Union lately but the Union cant last
Its people havent been trained to politics and whenever Tammany calls
their bluff they lay right down Youll never hear of the Union again
after a year or two

And by the way whats become of the good government clubs the
political nurseries of a few years ago

Do you ever hear of Good Government Club D and P and Q and Z any more
Whats become of the infants who were to grow up and show us how to
govern the city I know whats become of the nursery that was started
in my district You can find pretty much the whole outfit over in my
headquarters Washington Hall

The fact is that a reformer cant last in politics He can make a show
for a while but he always comes down like a rocket Politics is as much
a regular business as the grocery or the drygoods or the drug business
Youve got to be trained up to it or youre sure to fail Suppose a man
who knew nothing about the grocery trade suddenly went into the business
and tried to conduct it according to his own ideas Wouldnt he make a
mess of it He might make a splurge for a while as long as his money
lasted but his store would soon be empty Its just the same with
a reformer He hasnt been brought up in the difficult business of
politics and he makes a mess of it every time

Ive been studyin the political game for fortyfive years and dont
know it all yet Im learnin somethin all the time How then can you
expect what they call business men to turn into politics all at
once and make a success of it It is just as if I went up to Columbia
University and started to teach Greek They usually last about as long
in politics as I would last at Columbia

You cant begin too early in politics if you want to succeed at the
game I began several years before I could vote and so did every
successful leader in Tammany Hall When I was twelve years old I made
myself useful around the district headquarters and did work at all the
polls on election day Later on I hustled about gettin out voters who
had jags on or who were too lazy to come to the polls Theres a hundred
ways that boys can help and they get an experience thats the
first real step in statesmanship Show me a boy that hustles for the
organization on election day and Ill show you a comin statesman

Thats the a b c of politics It aint easy work to get up to q and
z You have to give nearly all your time and attention to it Of course
you may have some business or occupation on the side but the great
business of your life must be politics if you want to succeed in it
A few years ago Tammany tried to mix politics and business in equal
quantities by havin two leaders for each district a politician and
a business man They wouldnt mix They were like oil and water The
politician looked after the politics of his district the business
man looked after his grocery store or his milk route and whenever he
appeared at an executive meeting it was only to make trouble The whole
scheme turned out to be a farce and was abandoned mighty quick

Do you understand now why it is that a reformer goes down and out in
the first or second round while a politician answers to the gong every
time It is because the one has gone into the fight without trainin
while the other trains all the time and knows every fine point of the
game



Chapter 5 New York City Is Pie for the Hayseeds

THIS city is ruled entirely by the hayseed legislators at Albany Ive
never known an upstate Republican who didnt want to run things
here and Ive met many thousands of them in my long service in the
Legislature The hayseeds think we are like the Indians to the National
Governmentthat is sort of wards of the State who dont know how to
look after ourselves and have to be taken care of by the Republicans of
St Lawrence Ontario and other backwoods counties Why should anybody
be surprised because exGovernor Odell comes down here to direct the
Republican machine Newburg aint big enough for him He like all the
other upstate Republicans wants to get hold of New York City New York
is their pie

Say you hear a lot about the downtrodden people of Ireland and the
Russian peasants and the sufferin Boers Now let me tell you that they
have more real freedom and home rule than the people of this grand and
imperial city In England for example they make a pretense of givin
the Irish some selfgovernment In this State the Republican government
makes no pretense at all It says right out in the open New York City
is a nice big fat Goose Come along with your carvin knives and have a
slice They dont pretend to ask the Gooses consent

We dont own our streets or our docks or our waterfront or anything
else The Republican Legislature and Governor run the whole shootin
match Weve got to eat and drink what they tell us to eat and drink
and have got to choose our time for eatin and drinkin to suit them If
they dont feel like takin a glass of beer on Sunday we must abstain
If they have not got any amusements up in their backwoods we mustnt
have none Weve got to regulate our whole lives to suit them And then
we have to pay their taxes to boot

Did you ever go up to Albany from this city with a delegation that
wanted anything from the Legislature No Well dont The hayseeds
who run all the committees will look at you as if you were a child that
didnt know what it wanted and will tell you in so many words to go
home and be good and the Legislature will give you whatever it thinks is
good for you They put on a sort of patronizing air as much as to say
These children are an awful lot of trouble Theyre wantin candy all
the time and they know that it will make them sick They ought to thank
goodness that they have us to take care of them And if you try to
argue with them theyll smile in a pityin sort of way as if they were
humorin a spoiled child

But just let a Republican farmer from Chemung or Wayne or Tioga turn up
at the Capital The Republican Legislature will make a rush for him and
ask him what he wants and tell him if he doesnt see what he wants to
ask for it If he says his taxes are too high they reply to him All
right old man dont let that worry you How much do you want us to
take off

I guess about fifty per cent will about do for the present says the
man Can you fix me up

Sure the Legislature agrees Give us somethin New York City Is Pie
for the Hayseeds try harder dont be bashful Well take off sixty
per cent if you wish Thats what were here for

Then the Legislature goes and passes a law increasin the liquor tax or
some other tax in New York City takes a half of the proceeds for the
State Treasury and cuts down the farmers taxes to suit Its as easy
as rollin off a logwhen youve got a good workin majority and no
conscience to speak of

Let me give you another example It makes me hot under the collar to
tell about this Last year some hayseeds along the Hudson River mostly
in Odells neighborhood got dissatisfied with the docks where they
landed their vegetables brickbats and other things they produce in the
river counties They got together and said Lets take a trip down
to New York and pick out the finest dock we can find Odell and the
Legislature will do the rest They did come down here and what do
you think they hit on The finest dock in my district Invaded George W
Plunkitts district without sayin as much as by your leave Then they
called on Odell to put through a bill givin them this dock and he did

When the bill came before Mayor Low I made the greatest speech of my
life I pointed out how the Legislature could give the whole waterfront
to the hayseeds over the head of the Dock Commissioner in the same way
and warned the Mayor that nations had rebelled against their governments
for less But it was no go Odell and Low were pards andwell my dock
was stolen

You heard a lot in the State campaign about Odells great work in
reducin the State tax to almost nothin and youll hear a lot more
about it in the campaign next year How did he do it By cuttin down
the expenses of the State Government Oh no The expenses went up He
simply performed the old Republican act of milkin New York City The
only difference was that he nearly milked the city dry He not only ran
up the liquor tax but put all sorts of taxes on corporations banks
insurance companies and everything in sight that could be made to give
up Of course nearly the whole tax fell on the city Then Odell went
through the country districts and said See what I have done for you
You aint got any more taxes to pay the State Aint I a fine feller

Once a farmer in Orange County asked him How did you do it Ben

Dead easy he answered Whenever I want any money for the State
Treasury I know where to get it and he pointed toward New York City

And then all the Republican tinkerin with New York Citys charter
Nobody can keep up with it When a Republican mayor is in they give him
all sorts of power If a Tammany mayor is elected next fall I wouldnt
be surprised if they changed the whole business and arranged it so that
every city department should have four heads two of them Republicans
If we make a kick they would say You dont know whats good for you
Leave it to us Its our business



Chapter 6 To Hold Your District Study Human Nature and Act Accordin

Theres only one way to hold a district you must study human nature
and act accordin You cant study human nature in books Books is a
hindrance more than anything else If you have been to college so much
the worse for you Youll have to unlearn all you learned before you can
get right down to human nature and unlearnin takes a lot of time Some
men can never forget what they learned at college Such men may get to
be district leaders by a fluke but they never last

To learn real human nature you have to go among the people see them and
be seen1 know every man woman and child in the Fifteenth District
except them thats been born this summerand I know some of them too
I know what they like and what they dont like what they are strong at
and what they are weak in and I reach them by approachin at the right
side

For instance heres how I gather in the young men I hear of a young
feller thats proud of his voice thinks that he can sing fine I ask
him to come around to Washington Hall and join our Glee Club He comes
and sings and hes a follower of Plunkitt for life Another young
feller gains a reputation as a baseball player in a vacant lot I bring
him into our baseball dub That fixes him Youll find him workin for
my ticket at the polls next election day Then theres the feller that
likes rowin on the river the young feller that makes a name as a
waltzer on his block the young feller thats handy with his dukesI
rope them all in by givin them opportunities to show themselves off
I dont trouble them with political arguments I just study human nature
and act accordin

But you may say this game wont work with the hightoned fellers the
fellers that go through college and then join the Citizens Union Of
course it wouldnt work I have a special treatment for them I aint
like the patent medicine man that gives the same medicine for all
diseases The Citizens Union kind of a young man I love him Hes the
daintiest morsel of the lot and he dont often escape me

Before telling you how I catch him let me mention that before the
election last year the Citizens Union said they had four hundred
or five hundred enrolled voters in my district They had a lovely
headquarters too beautiful rolltop desks and the cutest rugs in the
world If I was accused of havin contributed to fix up the nest for
them I wouldnt deny it under oath What do I mean by that Never mind
You can guess from the sequel if youre sharp

Well election day came The Citizens Unions candidate for Senator
who ran against me just polled five votes in the district while I
polled something more than 14000 votes What became of the 400 or 500
Citizens Union enrolled voters in my district Some people guessed that
many of them were good Plunkitt men all along and worked with the Cits
just to bring them into the Plunkitt camp by election day You can guess
that way too if you want to I never contradict stories about me
especially in hot weather I just call your attention to the fact that
on last election day 395 Citizens Union enrolled voters in my district
were missin and unaccounted for

I tell you frankly though how I have captured some of the Citizens
Unions young men I have a plan that never fails I watch the City
Record to see when theres civil service examinations for good things
Then I take my young Cit in hand tell him all about the good thing and
get him worked up till he goes and takes an examination I dont bother
about him any more Its a cinch that he comes back to me in a few days
and asks to join Tammany Hall Come over to Washington Hall some night
and Ill show you a list of names on our roll marked CS which
means bucked up against civil service

As to the older voters I reach them too No I dont send them
campaign literature Thats rot People can get all the political stuff
they want to readand a good deal more tooin the papers Who reads
speeches nowadays anyhow Its bad enough to listen to them You
aint goin to gain any votes by stuffin the letter boxes with campaign
documents Like as not youll lose votes for theres nothin a man hates
more than to hear the letter carrier ring his bell and go to the letter
box ex pectin to find a letter he was lookin for and find only a lot
of printed politics I met a man this very mornin who told me he voted
the Democratic State ticket last year just because the Republicans kept
crammin his letter box with campaign documents

What tells in holdin your grip on your district is to go right down
among the poor families and help them in the different ways they need
help Ive got a regular system for this If theres a fire in Ninth
Tenth or Eleventh Avenue for example any hour of the day or night
Im usually there with some of my election district captains as soon as
the fire engines If a family is burned out I dont ask whether they
are Republicans or Democrats and I dont refer them to the Charity
Organization Society which would investigate their case in a month or
two and decide they were worthy of help about the time they are dead
from starvation I just get quarters for them buy clothes for them
if their clothes were burned up and fix them up till they get things
runnin again Its philanthropy but its politics toomighty good
politics Who can tell how many votes one of these fires bring me The
poor are the most grateful people in the world and let me tell you
they have more friends in their neighborhoods than the rich have in
theirs

If theres a family in my district in want I know it before the
charitable societies do and me and my men are first on the ground I
have a special corps to look up such cases The consequence is that
the poor look up to George W Plunkitt as a father come to him in
troubleand dont forget him on election day

Another thing I can always get a job for a deservin man I make it a
point to keep on the track of jobs and it seldom happens that I dont
have a few up my sleeve ready for use I know every big employer in the
district and in the whole city for that matter and they aint in the
habit of sayin no to me when I ask them for a job

And the childrenthe little roses of the district Do I forget them
Oh no They know me every one of them and they know that a sight of
Uncle George and candy means the same thing Some of them are the best
kind of votegetters Ill tell you a case Last year a little Eleventh
Avenue rosebud whose father is a Republican caught hold of his
whiskers on election day and said she wouldnt let go till hed promise
to vote for me And she didnt



Chapter 7 On The Shame of the Cities

IVE been readin a book by Lincoln Steffens on The Shame of the Cities
Steffens means well but like all reformers he dont know how to
make distinctions He cant see no difference between honest graft and
dishonest graft and consequent he gets things all mixed up Theres
the biggest kind of a difference between political looters and
politicians who make a fortune out of politics by keepin their eyes
wide open The looter goes in for himself alone without considerin his
organization or his city The politician looks after his own interests
the organizations interests and the citys interests all at the same
time See the distinction For instance I aint no looter The looter
hogs it I never hogged I made my pile in politics but at the same
time 1 served the organization and got more big improvements for New
York City than any other livin man And I never monkeyed with the penal
code

The difference between a looter and a practical politician is the
difference between the Philadelphia Republican gang and Tammany Hall
Steffens seems to think theyre both about the same but hes all wrong
The Philadelphia crowd runs up against the penal code Tammany dont
The Philadelphians aint satisfied with robbin the bank of all its gold
and paper money They stay to pick up the nickels and pennies and the
cop comes and nabs them Tammany aint no such fool Why I remember
about fifteen or twenty years ago a Republican superintendent of the
Philadelphia almshouse stole the zinc roof off the buildin and sold
it for junk That was carryin things to excess Theres a limit to
everything and the Philadelphia Republicans go beyond the limit It
seems like they cant be cool and moderate like real politicians It
aint fair therefore to class Tammany men with the Philadelphia gang
Any man who undertakes to write political books should never for a
moment lose sight of the distinction between honest graft and dishonest
graft which I explained in full in another talk If he puts all kinds
of graft on the same level hell make the fatal mistake that Steffens
made and spoil his book

A big city like New York or Philadelphia or Chicago might be compared
to a sort of Garden of Eden from a political point of view Its an
orchard full of beautiful apple trees One of them has got a big sign
on it marked Penal Code TreePoison The other trees have lots of
apples on them for all Yet the fools go to the Penal Code Tree Why
For the reason I guess that a cranky child refuses to eat good food
and chews up a box of matches with relish I never had any temptation to
touch the Penal Code Tree The other apples are good enough for me and
0 Lord how many of them there are in a big city

Steffens made one good point in his book He said he found that
Philadelphia ruled almost entirely by Americans was more corrupt than
New York where the Irish do almost all the governin I could have told
him that before he did any investigatin if he had come to me The Irish
was born to rule and theyre the honestest people in the world Show me
the Irishman who would steal a roof off an almhouse He dont exist
Of course if an Irishman had the political pull and the roof was much
worn he might get the city authorities to put on a new one and get the
contract for it himself and buy the old roof at a bargainbut thats
honest graft Its goin about the thing like a gentleman and theres
more money in it than in tearin down an old roof and cartin it to the
junkmansmore money and no penal code

One reason why the Irishman is more honest in politics than many Sons of
the Revolution is that he is grateful to the country and the city that
gave him protection and prosperity when he was driven by oppression from
the Emerald Isle Say that sentence is fine aint it Im goin to get
some literary feller to work it over into poetry for next St Patricks
Day dinner

Yes the Irishman is grateful His one thought is to serve the city
which gave him a home He has this thought even before he lands in New
York for his friends here often have a good place in one of the city
departments picked out for him while he is still in the old country Is
it any wonder that he has a tender spot in his heart for old New York
when he is on its salary list the mornin after he lands

Now a few words on the general subject of the so called shame of
cities I dont believe that the government of our cities is any worse
in proportion to opportunities than it was fifty years ago Ill
explain what I mean by in proportion to opportunities A half
a century ago our cities were small and poor There wasnt many
temptations lyin around for politicians There was hardly anything to
steal and hardly any opportunities for even honest graft A city could
count its money every night before goin to bed and if three cents
was missin all the fire bells would be rung What credit was there in
bein honest under them circumstances It makes me tired to hear of old
codgers back in the thirties or forties boastin that they retired from
politics without a dollar except what they earned in their profession or
business If they lived today with all the existin opportunities they
would be just the same as twentiethcentury politicians There aint any
more honest people in the world just now than the convicts in Sing
Sing Not one of them steals anything Why Because they cant See the
application

Understand I aint defendin politicians of today who steal The
politician who steals is worse than a thief He is a fool With the
grand opportunities all around for the man with a political pull
theres no excuse for stealin a cent The point I want to make is
that if there is some stealin in politics it dont mean that the
politicians of 1905 are as a class worse than them of 1835 It just
means that the oldtimers had nothin to steal while the politicians
now are surrounded by all kinds of temptations and some of them
naturallythe fool onesbuck up against the penal code



Chapter 8 Ingratitude in Politics

THEREs no crime so mean as ingratitude in politics but every great
statesman from the beginnin of the world has been up against it Caesar
had his Brutus that king of ShakespearesLeary I think you call
himhad his own daughters go back on him Platt had his Odell and
Ive got my The McManus Its a real proof that a man is great when
he meets with political ingratitude Great men have a tender trustin
nature So have I outside of the contractin and real estate business
In politics I have trusted men who have told me they were my friends
and if traitors have turned up in my camp well I only had the same
experience as Caesar Leary and the others About my Brutus McManus
you know has seven brothers and they call him The because he is the
boss of the lot and to distinguish him from all other McManuses
For several years he was a political bushwhacker In campaigns he
was sometimes on the fence sometimes on both sides of the fence
and sometimes under the fence Nobody knew where to find him at any
particular time and nobody trusted himthat is nobody but me I
thought there was some good in him after all and that if I took him in
hand I could make a man of him yet

I did take him in hand a few years ago My friends told me it would be
the Brutus Leary business all over again but I didnt believe them
I put my trust in The I nominated him for the Assembly and he
was elected A year afterwards when I was runnin for reelection as
Senator I nominated him for the Assembly again on the ticket with
me What do you think happened We both carried the Fifteenth Assembly
District but he ran away ahead of me Just think Ahead of me in my
own district I was just dazed When I began to recover my election
district captains came to me and said that McManus had sold me out
with the idea of knockin me out of the Senatorship and then tryin
to capture the leadership of the district I couldnt believe it My
trustin nature couldnt imagine such treachery

I sent for McManus and said with my voice tremblin with emotions
They say you have done me dirt The It cant be true Tell me it
aint true

The almost wept as he said he was innocent

Never have I done you dirt George he declared Wicked traitors have
tried to do you I dont know just who they are yet but Im on their
trail and Ill find them or abjure the name of The McManus Im goin
out right now to find them

Well The kept his word as far as goin out and findin the traitors
was concerned He found them all rightand put himself at their
head Oh no He didnt have to go far to look for them Hes got them
gathered in his clubrooms now and hes doin his best to take the
leadership from the man that made him So you see that Caesar and Leary
and mes in the same boat only Ill come out on top while Caesar and
Leary went under

Now let me tell you that the ingrate in politics never flourishes long
I can give you lots of examples Look at the men who done up Roscoe
Conkling when he resigned from the United States Senate and went to
Albany to ask for reelection Whats become of them Passed from view
like a movin picture Who took Conklings place in the Senate Twenty
dollars even that you cant remember his name without looking in the
almanac And poor old Plattt Hes down and out now and Odell is in the
saddle but that dont mean that hell always be in the saddle His
enemies are workin hard all the time to do him and I wouldnt be a bit
surprised if he went out before the next State campaign

The politicians who make a lastin success in politics are the men who
are always loyal to their friends even up to the gate of State prison
if necessary men who keep their promises and never lie Richard Croker
used to say that tellin the truth and stickin to his friends was the
political leaders stock in trade Nobody ever said anything truer and
nobody lived up to it better than Croker That is why he remained leader
of Tammany Hall as long as he wanted to Every man in the organization
trusted him Sometimes he made mistakes that hurt in campaigns but they
were always on the side of servin his friends

Its the same with Charles F Murphy He has always stood by his friends
even when it looked like he would be downed for doin so Remember how
he stuck to McClellan in 1903 when all the Brooklyn leaders were against
him and it seemed as if Tammany was in for a grand smashup Its men
like Croker and Murphy that stay leaders as long as they live not men
like Brutus and McManus

Now I want to tell you why political traitors in New York City
especially are punished quick Its because the Irish are in a
majority The Irish above all people in the world hates a traitor
You cant hold them back when a traitor of any kind is in sight and
rememberin old Ireland they take particular delight in doin up a
political traitor Most of the voters in my district are Irish or of
Irish descent theyve spotted The McManus and when they get a chance
at him at the polls next time they wont do a thing to him

The question has been asked Is a politician ever justified in going
back on his district leader I answer No as long as the leader
hustles around and gets all the jobs possible for his constituents
When the voters elect a man leader they make a sort of a contract with
him They say although it aint written out Weve put you here to
look out for our Interests You want to see that this district gets all
the jobs thats comm to it Be faithful to us and well be faithful to
you

The district leader promises and that makes a solemn contract If he
lives up to it spends most of his time chasm after places in the
departments picks up jobs from railroads and contractors for his
followers and shows himself in all ways a true statesman then his
followers are bound in honor to uphold him just as theyre bound to
uphold the Constitution of the United States But if he only looks after
his own interests or shows no talent for scenting out jobs or aint
got the nerve to demand and get his share of the good things that are
going his followers may be absolved from their allegiance and they may
up and swat him without bein put down as political ingrates



Chapter 9 Reciprocity in Patronage

WHENEVER Tammany is whipped at the polls the people set to predictin
that the organization is going to smash They say we cant get along
without the offices and that the district leaders are going to desert
wholesale That was what was said after the throwdowns in 1894 and 1901
But it didnt happen did it Not one big Tammany man deserted and
today the organization is stronger than ever

How was that It was because Tammany has more than one string to its
bow

I acknowledge that you cant keep an organization together without
patronage Men aint in politics for nothin They want to get somethin
out of it

But there is more than one kind of patronage We lost the public kind
or a greater part of it in 1901 but Tammany has an immense private
patronage that keeps things going when it gets a setback at the polls

Take me for instance When Low came in some of my men lost public
jobs but I fixed them all right I dont know how many jobs I got for
them on the surface and elevated railroadsseveral hundred

I placed a lot more on public works done by contractors and no Tammany
man goes hungry in my district Plunkitts OK on an application for
a job is never turned down for they all know that Plunkitt and Tammany
dont stay out long See

Let me tell you too that I got jobs from Republicans in
officeFederal and otherwise When Tammanys on top I do good turns for
the Republicans When theyre on top they dont forget me

Me and the Republicans are enemies just one day in the yearelection
day Then we fight tooth and nail The rest of the time its live and let
live with us

On election day I try to pile up as big a majority as I can against
George Wanmaker the Republican leader of the Fifteenth Any other day
George and I are the best of friends I can go to him and say George
I want you to place this friend of mine He says Mi right Senator
Or vice versa

You see we differ on tariffs and currencies and all them things but
we agree on the main proposition that when a man works in politics he
should get something out of it

The politicians have got to stand together this way or there wouldnt
be any political parties in a short time Civil service would gobble up
everything politicians would be on the bum the republic would fall and
soon there would be the cry of Vevey le roil

The very thought of this civil service monster makes my blood boil I
have said a lot about it already but another instance of its awful work
just occurs to me

Let me tell you a sad but true story Last Wednesday a line of carriages
wound into Cavalry Cemetery I was in one of them It was the funeral of
a young man from my districta bright boy that I had great hopes of

When he went to school he was the most patriotic boy in the district
Nobody could sing The StarSpangled Banner like him nobody was as
fond of waving a flag and nobody shot off as many firecrackers on the
Fourth of July And when he grew up he made up his mind to serve his
country in one of the city departments There was no way of gettin
there without passin a civil service examination Well he went down to
the civil service office and tackled the fool questions I saw him next
dayit was Memorial Day and soldiers were marchin and flags flyin
and people cheerin

Where was my young man Standin on the corner scowlin at the whole
show When I asked him why he was so quiet he laughed in a wild sort of
way and said What rot all this is

Just then a band came along playing Liberty He laughed wild again and
said Liberty Rats

I dont guess I need to make a long story of it

From the time that young man left the civil service office he lost all
patriotism He didnt care no more for his country He went to the
dogs

He aint the only one Theres a gravestone over some bright young mans
head for every one of them infernal civil service examinations They
are underminin the manhood of the nation and makin the Declaration
of Independence a farce We need a new Declaration of Independence
independence of the whole fool civil service business

I mention all this now to show why it is that the politicians of two big
parties help each other along and why Tammany men are tolerably happy
when not in power in the city When we win I wont let any deservin
Republican in my neighborhood suffer from hunger or thirst although of
course I look out for my own people first

Now Ive never gone in for nonpartisan business but I do think that
all the leaders of the two parties should get together and make an open
nonpartisan fight against civil service their common enemy They
could keep up their quarrels about imperialism and free silver and high
tariff They dont count for much alongside of civil service which
strikes right at the root of the government The time is fast coming
when civil service or the politicians will have to go And it will be
here sooner than they expect if the politicians dont unite drop all
them minor issues for a while and make a stand against the civil service
flood thats sweepin over the country like them floods out West



Chapter 10 Brooklynites NaturalBorn Hayseeds

SOME people are wonderin why it is that the Brooklyn Democrats have
been sidin with David B Hill and the upstate crowd Theres no cause
for wonder I have made a careful study of the Brooklynite and I can
tell you why Its because a Brooklynite is a naturalborn hay seed
and can never become a real New Yorker He cant be trained into it
Consolidation didnt make him a New Yorker and nothin on earth can A
man born in Germany can settle down and become a good New Yorker So
can an Irishman in fact the first word an Irish boy learns in the old
country is New York and when he grows up and comes here he is at
home right away Even a Jap or a Chinaman can become a New Yorker but a
Brooklynite never can

And why Because Brooklyn dont seem to be like any other place on
earth Once let a man grow up amidst Brooklyns cobblestones with the
odor of Newton Creek and Gowanus Canal ever in his nostrils and theres
no place in the world for him except Brooklyn And even if he dont grow
up there if he is born there and lives there only in his boyhood and
then moves away he is still beyond redemption In one of my speeches
in the Legislature I gave an example of this and its worth repeatin
now Soon after I became a leader on the West Side a quarter of a
century ago I came across a bright boy about seven years old who had
just been brought over from Brooklyn by his parents I took an interest
in the boy and when he grew up I brought him into politics Finally I
sent him to the Assembly from my district Now remember that the boy was
only seven years old when he left Brooklyn and was twentythree when he
went to the Assembly Youd think he had forgotten all about Brooklyn
wouldnt you I did but I was dead wrong When that young fellow got
into the Assembly he paid no attention to bills or debates about New
York City He didnt even show any interest in his own district But
just let Brooklyn be mentioned or a bill be introduced about Gowanus
Canal or the Long Island Railroad and he was all attention Nothin
else on earth interested him

The end came when I caught himwhat do you think I caught him at One
mornin I went over from the Senate to the Assembly chamber and there I
found my young man readinactually readin a Brooklyn newspaper
When he saw me comm he tried to hide the paper but it was too late
I caught him dead to rights and I said to him Jimmy Im afraid
New York aint fascinatin enough for you You had better move back to
Brooklyn after your present term And he did I met him the other day
crossin the Brooklyn Bridge carryin a hobbyhorse under one arm and a
dolls carriage under the other and lookin perfectly happy

McCarren and his men are the same way They cant get it into their
heads that they are New Yorkers and just tend naturally toward
supportin Hill and his hayseeds against Murphy I had some hopes of
McCarren till lately He spends so much of his time over here and has
seen so much of the world that I thought he might be an exception and
grow out of his Brooklyn surroundings but his course at Albany shows
that there is no exception to the rule Say Id rather take a Hottentot
in hand to bring up as a good New Yorker than undertake the job with a
Brooklynite Honest I would

And by the way come to think of it is there really any upstate
Democrats left It has never been proved to my satisfaction that there
is any I know that some upstate members of the State committee call
themselves Democrats Besides these I know at least six more men above
the Bronx who make a livin out of professin to be Democrats and I
have just heard of some few more But if there is any real Democrats up
the State what becomes of them on election day They certainly dont
go near the polls or they vote the Republican ticket Look at the last
three State elections Roosevelt piled up more than 100000 majority
above the Bronx Odell piled up about 160000 majority the first time
he ran and 131000 the second time About all the Democratic votes cast
were polled in New York City The Republicans can get all the votes they
want up the State Even when we piled up 123000 majority for Coler in
the city In 1902 the Republicans went it 8000 better above the Bronx

Thats why it makes me mad to hear about upstate Democrats controllin
our State convention and sayin who we shall choose for President
Its just like Staten Island undertakin to dictate to a New York City
convention I remember once a Syracuse man came to Richard Croker at
the Democratic Club handed him a letter of introduction and said Im
lookin for a job in the Street Cleanin Department Im backed by a
hundred upstate Democrats Croker looked hard at the man a minute and
then said Upstate Democrats Upstate Democrats I didnt know there
was any upstate Democrats Just walk up and down a while till I see what
an upstate Democrat looks like

Another thing When a campaign is on did you ever hear of an upstate
Democrat makin a contribution Not much Tammany has had to foot the
whole bill and when any of Hills men came down to New York to help
him in the campaign we had to pay their board Whenever money is to be
raised theres nothin doin up the State The Democrats therealways
providin that there is any Democrats theretake to the woods
Supposin Tammany turned over the campaigns to the Hill men and then
held off what would happen Why they would have to hire a shed out in
the suburbs of Albany for a headquarters unless the Democratic National
Committee put up for the campaign expenses Tammanys got the votes and
the cash The Hill crowds only got hot air



Chapter 11 Tammany Leaders Not Bookworms

You hear a lot of talk about the Tammany district leaders bein
illiterate men If illiterate means havin common sense we plead
guilty But if they mean that the Tammany leaders aint got no education
and aint gents they dont know what theyre talkin about Of course
we aint all bookworms and college professors If we were Tammany might
win an election once in four thousand years Most of the leaders are
plain American citizens of the people and near to the people and they
have all the education they need to whip the dudes who part their name
in the middle and to run the City Government Weve got bookworms too
in the organization But we dont make them district leaders We keep
them for ornaments on parade days

Tammany Hall is a great big machine with every part adjusted delicate
to do its own particular work It runs so smooth that you wouldnt think
it was a complicated affair but it is Every district leader is fitted
to the district he runs and he wouldnt exactly fit any other district
Thats the reason Tammany never makes the mistake the Fusion outfit
always makes of sendin men into the districts who dont know the
people and have no sympathy with their peculiaritiesWe dont put a
silk stockin on the Bowery nor do we make a man who is handy with his
fists leader of the Twentyninth The Fusionists make about the same
sort of a mistake that a repeater made at an election in Albany several
years ago He was hired to go to the polls early in a halfdozen
election districts and vote on other mens names before these men
reached the polls At one place when he was asked his name by the poll
clerk he had the nerve to answer William Croswell Doane

Come off You aint Bishop Doane said the poll clerk

The hell I aint youI yelled the repeater

Now that is the sort of bad judgment the Fusionists are guilty of They
dont pick men to suit the work they have to do

Take me for instance My district the Fifteenth is made up of all
sorts of people and a cosmopolitan is needed to run it successful Im
a cosmopolitan When I get into the silkstockin part of the district
I can talk grammar and all that with the best of them I went to school
three winters when I was a boy and I learned a lot of fancy stuff that
I keep for occasions There aint a silk stockin in the district who
aint proud to be seen talkin with George Washington Plunkitt and
maybe they learn a thing or two from their talks with me Theres one
man in the district a big banker who said to me one day George
you can sling the most vigorous English I ever heard You remind me of
Senator Hoar of Massachusetts Of course that was puttin it on too
thick but say honest I like Senator Hoars speeches He once quoted
in the United States Senate some of my remarks on the curse of civil
service and though he didnt agree with me altogether I noticed
that our ideas are alike in some things and we both have the knack of
puttin things strong only he put on more frills to suit his audience

As for the common people of the district I am at home with them at all
times When I go among them I dont try to show off my grammar or talk
about the Constitution or how many volts there is in electricity or
make it appear in any way that I am better educated than they are They
wouldnt stand for that sort of thing No I drop all monkeyshines
So you see Ive got to be several sorts of a man in a single day a
lightnin change artist so to speak But I am one sort of man always
in one respect I stick to my friends high and low do them a good
turn whenever I get a chance and hunt up all the jobs going for my
constituents There aint a man in New York whos got such a scent for
political jobs as I have When I get up in the mornin I can almost
tell every time whether a job has become vacant over night and what
department its in and Im the first man on the ground to get it Only
last week I turned up at the office of Water Register Savage at 9
AM and told him I wanted a vacant place in his office for one of my
constituents How did you know that OBrien had got out he asked me
I smelled it in the air when I got up this mornin I answered Now
that was the fact I didnt know there was a man in the department named
OBrien much less that he had got out but my scent led me to the Water
Registers office and it dont often lead me wrong

A cosmopolitan aint needed in all the other districts but our men are
just the kind to rule Theres Dan Finn in the Battery district bluff
jolly Dan who is now on the bench Maybe youd think that a court
justice is not the man to hold a district like that but youre
mistaken Most of the voters of the district are the janitors of the big
office buildings on lower Broadway and their helpers These janitors are
the most dignified and haughtiest of men Even I would have trouble in
holding them Nothin less than a judge on the bench is good enough for
them Dan does the dignity act with the janitors and when he is with
the boys he hangs up the ermine in the closet and becomes a jolly good
fellow

Big Tom Foley leader of the Second District fits in exactly too Tom
sells whisky and good whisky and he is able to take care of himself
against a half dozen thugs if he runs up against them on Cherry Hill or
in Chatharn Square Pat Ryder and Johnnie Ahearn of the Third and Fourth
Districts are just the men for the places Ahearns constituents are
about half Irishmen and half Jews He is as popular with one race
as with the other He eats corned beef and kosher meat with equal
nonchalance and its all the same to him whether he takes off his hat
in the church or pulls it down over his ears in the synagogue

The other downtown leaders Barney Martin of the Fifth Tim Sullivan of
the Sixth Pat Keahon of the Seventh Florrie Sullivan of the Eighth
Frank Goodwin of the Ninth Julius Harburger of the Tenth Pete Dooling
of the Eleventh Joe Scully of the Twelfth Johnnie Oakley of the
Fourteenth and Pat Keenan of the Sixteenth are just built to suit the
people they have to deal with They dont go in for literary business
much downtown but these men are all real gents and thats what the
people wanteven the poorest tenement dwellers As you go farther
uptown you find a rather different kind of district leader Theres
Victor Dowling who was until lately the leader of the Twentyfourth
Hes a lulu He knows the Latin grammar backward Whats strange hes
a sensible young fellow too About once in a century we come across
a fellow like that in Tammany politics James J Martin leader of the
Twentyseventh is also something of a hightoner and publishes a law
paper while Thomas E Rush of the Twentyninth is a lawyer and Isaac
Hopper of the Thirtyfirst is a big contractor The downtown leaders
wouldnt do uptown and vice versa So you see these fool critics
dont know what theyre talkin about when they criticize Tammany Hall
the most perfect political machine on earth



Chapter 12 Dangers of the Dress Suit in Politics

PUTIN on style dont pay in politics The people wont stand for it If
youve got an achin for style sit down on it till you have made your
pile and landed a Supreme Court Justiceship with a fourteenyear term at
17000 a year or some job of that kind Then youve got about all you
can get out of politics and you can afford to wear a dress suit all day
and sleep in it all night if you have a mind to But before you have
caught onto your life meal ticket be simple Live like your neighbors
even if you have the means to live better Make the poorest man in your
district feel that he is your equal or even a bit superior to you

Above all things avoid a dress suit You have no idea of the harm
that dress suits have done in politics They are not so fatal to young
politicians as civil service reform and drink but they have scores of
victims I will mention one sad case After the big Tammany victory
in 1897 Richard Croker went down to Lakewood to make up the slate of
offices for Mayor Van Wyck to distribute All the district leaders and
many more Tammany men went down there too to pick up anything good
that was goin There was nothin but dress suits at dinner at Lakewood
and Croker wouldnt let any Tammany men go to dinner without them Well
a bright young West Side politician who held a threethousan dollar job
in one of the departments went to Lakewood to ask Croker for something
better He wore a dress suit for the first time in his hie It was his
undoin He got stuck on himself He thought he looked too beautiful for
anything and when he came home he was a changed man As soon as he got
to his house every evenin he put on that dress Suit and set around in
it until bedtime That didnt satisfy him long He wanted others to see
how beautiful he was in a dress suit so he joined dancin clubs and
began goin to all the balls that was given in town Soon he began
to neglect his family Then he took to drinkin and didnt pay any
attention to his political work in the district The end came in less
than a year He was dismissed from the department and went to the dogs
The other day I met him rigged out almost like a hobo but he still
had a dresssuit vest on When I asked him what he was doin he said
Nothin at present but I got a promise of a job enrollin voters at
Citizens Union headquarters Yes a dress Suit had brought him that
low

Ill tell you another case right in my own Assembly District A few
years ago I had as one of my lieutenants a man named Zeke Thompson He
did fine work for me and I thought he had a bright future One day he
came to me said he intended to buy an option on a house and asked me
to help him out I like to see a young man acquirin property and I had
so much confidence in Zeke that I put up for him on the house

A month or so afterwards I heard strange rumors People told me that
Zeke was beginnin to put on style They said he had a billiard table in
his house and had hired Jap servants I couldnt believe it The idea
of a Democrat a follower of George Washington Plunkitt in the Fifteenth
Assembly District havin a billiard table and Jap servants One mornin
I called at the house to give Zeke a chance to clear himself A Jap
opened the door for me I saw the billiard tableZeke was guilty When
I got over the shock I said to Zeke You are caught with the goods on
No excuses will go The Democrats of this district aint used to dukes
and princes and we wouldnt feel comfortable in your company Youd
overpower us You had better move up to the Nineteenth or Twentyseventh
District and hang a silk stocking on your door He went up to the
Nineteenth turned Republican and was lookin for an Albany job the
last I heard of him

Now nobody ever saw me puttin on any style Im the same Plunkitt I
was when I entered politics forty years ago That is why the people of
the district have confidence in me If I went into the stylish business
even I Plunkitt might be thrown down in the district That was shown
pretty clearly in the senatorial fight last year A day before the
election my enemies circulated a report that I had ordered a 10000
automobile and a 125 dress suit I sent out contradictions as fast as
I could but I wasnt able to stamp out the infamous slander before the
votin was over and I suffered some at the polls The people wouldnt
have minded much if I had been accused of robbin the city treasury for
theyre used to slanders of that kind in campaigns but the automobile
and the dress suit were too much for them

Another thing that people wont stand for is showin off your learnin
Thats just puttin on style in another way If youre makin speeches
in a campaign talk the language the people talk Dont try to show how
the situation is by quotin Shakespeare Shakespeare was all right in
his way but he didnt know anything about Fifteenth District politics
If you know Latin and Greek and have a hankerin to work them off on
somebody hire a stranger to come to your house and listen to you for a
couple of hours then go out and talk the language of the Fifteenth to
the people I know its an awful temptation the hankerin to show off
your learnin Ive felt it myself but I always resist it I know the
awful consequences



Chapter 13 On Municipal Ownership

I AM for municipal ownership on one condition that the civil service
law be repealed Its a grand ideathe city the railroads the gas
works and all that Just see how many thousands of new places there
would be for the workers in Tammany Why there would be almost enough
to go around if no civil service law stood in the way My plan is this
first get rid of that infamous law and then go ahead and by degrees get
municipal ownership

Some of the reformers are sayin that municipal ownership wont do
because it would give a lot of patronage to the politicians How those
fellows mix things up when they argue Theyre givin the strongest
argument in favor of municipal ownership when they say that Who is
better fitted to run the railroads and the gas plants and the ferries
than the men who make a business of lookin after the interests of the
city Who is more anxious to serve the city Who needs the jobs more

Look at the Dock Department The city owns the docks and how beautiful
Tammany manages them I cant tell you how many places they provide for
our workers I know there is a lot of talk about dock graft but that
talk comes from the outs When the Republicans had the docks under Low
and Strong you didnt hear them sayin anything about graft did you
No they just went in and made hay while the sun shoneThats always
the case When the reformers are out they raise the yell that Tammany
men should be sent to jail When they get in theyre so busy keepin
out of jail themselves that they dont have no time to attack Tammany

All I want is that municipal ownership be postponed till I get my bill
repealin the civil service law before the next legislature It would be
all a mess if every man who wanted a job would have to run up against
a civil service examination For instance if a man wanted a job as
motorman on a surface car its ten to one that they would ask him Who
wrote the Latin grammar and if so why did he write it How many years
were you at college Is there any part of the Greek language you dont
know State all you dont know and why you dont know it Give a list
of all the sciences with full particulars about each one and how it came
to be discovered Write out word for word the last ten decisions of the
United States Supreme Court and show if they conflict with the last ten
decisions of the police courts of New York City

Before the wouldbe motorman left the civil service room the chances
are he would be a raving lunatic Anyhow I wouldnt like to ride on his
car Just here I want to say one last final word about civil service
In the last ten years I have made an investigation which Ive kept quiet
till this time Now I have all the figures together and Im ready to
announce the result My investigation was to find out how many civil
service reformers and how many politicians were in state prisons I
discovered that there was forty per cent more civil service reformers
among the jailbirds If any legislative committee wants the detailed
figures Ill prove what I say I dont want to give the figures now
because I want to keep them to back me up when I go to Albany to get
the civil service law repealed Dont you think that when Ive had my
inning the civil service law will go down and the people will see that
the politicians are all right and that they ought to have the job of
runnin things when municipal ownership comes

One thing more about municipal ownership If the city owned the
railroads etc salaries would be sure to go up Higher salaries is
the cryin need of the day Municipal ownership would increase them all
along the line and would stir up such patriotism as New York City never
knew before You cant be patriotic on a salary that just keeps the wolf
from the door Any man who pretends he can will bear watchin Keep your
hand on your watch and pocketbook when hes about But when a man has
a good fat salary he finds himself hummin Hail Columbia all
unconscious and he fancies when hes ridin in a trolley car that the
wheels are always sayin Yankee Doodle Came to Town I know how it is
myself When I got my first good job from the city I bought up all the
firecrackers in my district to salute this glorious country I couldnt
wait for the Fourth of July 1 got the boys on the block to fire them
off for me and I felt proud of bein an American For a long time after
that I use to wake up nights singin The StarSpangled Banner



Chapter 14 Tammany the Only Lastin Democracy

Ive seen more than one hundred Democracies rise and fall in New
York City in the last quarter of a century At least a halfdozen new
socalled Democratic organizations are formed every year All of them go
in to down Tammany and take its place but they seldom last more than
a year or two while Tammanys like the everlastin rocks the eternal
hills and the blockades on the L roadit goes on forever

I recall offhand the County Democracy which was the only real opponent
Tammany has had in my time the Irving Hall Democracy the New
York State Democracy the GermanAmerican Democracy the Protection
Democracy the Independent County Democracy the Greater New York
Democracy the Jimmy OBrien Democracy the Delicatessen Dealers
Democracy the Silver Democracy and the Italian Democracy Not one of
them is livin today although I hear somethin about the ghost of the
Greater New York Democracy bein seen on Broadway once or twice a year

In the old days of the County Democracy a new Democratic organization
meant some trouble for Tammanyfor a time anyhow Nowadays a new
Democracy means nothin at all except that about a dozen bonehunters
have got together for one campaign only to try to induce Tammany to give
them a job or two or in order to get in with the reformers for the same
purpose You might think that it would cost a lot of money to get up
one of these organizations and keep it goin for even one campaign
but Lord bless you it costs next to nothin Jimmy OBrien brought the
manufacture of Democracies down to an exact science and reduced the
cost of production so as to bring it within the reach of all Any man
with 50 can now have a Democracy of his own

Ive looked into the industry and can give rockbottom figures Heres
the items of cost of a new Democracy

 A dinner to twelve bonehunters 1200
 A speech on Jeffersonian Democracy 0000
 A proclamation of principles typewriting 200
 Rent of a small room one month for headquarters 1200
 Stationery 200
 Twelve secondhand chairs 600
 One secondhand table 200
 Twentynine cuspidors 900
 Sign painting 500
 Total 
 5000

Is there any reason for wonder then that Democracies spring up all
over when a municipal campaign is comm on If you land even one small
job you get a big return on your investment You dont have to pay for
advertisin in the papers The New York papers tumble over one another
to give columns to any new organization that comes out against Tammany
In describin the formation of a Democracy on the 50 basis accordin
to the items I give the papers would say somethin like this The
organization of the Delicatessen Democracy last night threatens the
existence of Tammany Hall It is a grand move for a new and pure
Democracy in this city Well may the Tammany leaders be alarmed panic
has already broke loose in Fourteenth Street The vast crowd that
gathered at the launching of the new organization the stirrin speeches
and the proclamation of principles mean that at last there is an
uprisin that will end Tammanys career of corruption The Delicatessen
Democracy will open in a few days spacious headquarters where all true
Democrats may gather and prepare for the fight

Say aint some of the papers awful gullible about politics Talk
about comeons from Iowa or Texas they aint in it with the childlike
simplicity of these papers

Its a wonder to me that more men dont go into this kind of
manufacturin industry It has bigger profits generally than the
greengoods business and none of the risks And you dont have to invest
as much as the greengoods men Just see what good things some of these
Democracies got in the last few years The New York State Democracy in
1897 landed a Supreme Court Justiceship for the man who manufactured the
concerna fourteenyear term at 17500 a year that is 245000 You
see Tammany was rather scared that year and was bluffed into givin
this job to get the support of the State Democracy which by the way
went out of business quick and prompt the day after it got this big
plum The next year the German Democracy landed a place of the same
kind And then see how the Greater New York Democracy worked the game
on the reformers in 1901 The men who managed this concern were former
Tammanyites who had lost their grip yet they made the Citizens Union
innocents believe that they were the real thing in the way of reformers
and that they had 100000 voter back of them They got the Borough
President of Manhattan the President of the Board of Aldermen the
Register and a lot of lesser places it was the greatest bunco game of
modern times

And then in 1894 when Strong was elected mayor what a harvest it
was for all the little Democracies that was made to order that year
Every one of them got somethin good In one case all the nine men in
an organization got jobs payin from 2000 to 5000 I happen to know
exactly what it cost to manufacture that organization It was 4204
They left out the stationery and had only twentythree cuspidors The
extra four cents was for two postage stamps

The only reason I can imagine why more men dont go into this industry
is because they dont know about it And just here it strikes me that
it might not be wise to publish what Ive said Perhaps if it gets to
be known what a snap this manufacture of Democracies is all the
greengoods men the buncosteerers and the young Napoleons of finance
will go into it and the public will be humbugged more than it has been
But after all what difference would it make Theres always a certain
number of suckers and a certain number of men lookin for a chance to
take them in and the suckers are sure to be took one way or another
Its the everlastin law of demand and supply



Chapter 15 Concerning Gas in Politics

SINCE the eightycent gas bill was defeated in Albany everybodys
talkin about senators bein bribed Now I wasnt in the Senate last
session and I dont know the ins and outs of everything that was done
but I can tell you that the legislators are often hauled over the coals
when they are all on the level Ive been there and I know For instance
when I voted in the Senate in 1904 for the Remsen Bill that the
newspapers called the Astoria Gas Grab Bill they didnt do a thing to
me The papers kept up a howl about all the supporters of the bill bein
bought up by the Consolidated Gas Company and the Citizens Union
did me the honor to call me the commanderinchief of the Black Horse
Cavalry

The fact is that I was workin for my district all this time and I
wasnt bribed by nobody Theres several of these gashouses in the
district and I wanted to get them over to Astoria for three reasons
first because theyre nuisances second because theres no votes in
them for me any longer third becausewell I had a little private
reason which Ill explain further on I neednt explain how theyre
nuisances Theyre worse than open sewers Still I might have stood
that if they hadnt degenerated so much in the last few years

Ah gashouses aint what they used to be Not very long ago each
gashouse was good for a couple of hundred votes All the men employed in
them were Irishmen and Germans who lived in the district Now it is
all different The men are dagoes who live across in Jersey and take
no interest in the district Whats the use of havin illsmellin
gashouses if theres no votes in them

Now as to my private reason Well Im a business man and go in for
any business thats profitable and honest Real estate is one of my
specialties I know the value of every foot of ground in my district
and I calculated long ago that if them gashouses was removed
surroundin property would go up 100 per cent When the Remsen Bill
providin for the removal of the gashouses to Queens County came up I
said to myself George hasnt your chance come I answered Sure
Then I sized up the chances of the bill I found it was certain to
pass the Senate and the Assembly and I got assurances straight from
headquarters that Governor Odell would sign it Next I came down to the
city to find out the mayors position I got it straight that he would
approve the bill too

Cant you guess what I did then Like any sane man who had my
information I went in and got options on a lot of the property around
the gashouses Well the bill went through the Senate and the Assembly
all right and the mayor signed it but Odell backslided at the last
minute and the whole game fell through If it had succeeded I guess I
would have been accused of graftin What I want to know is what do you
call it when I got left and lost a pot of money

I not only lost money but I was abused for votin for the bill Wasnt
that outrageous They said I was in with the Consolidated Gas Company
and all other kinds of rot when I was really only workin for my
district and tryin to turn an honest penny on the side Anyhow I got
a little fun out of the business When the Remsen Bill was up I was
tryin to put through a bill of my own the Spuyten Duyvil Bill which
provided for fillin in some land under water that the New York Central
Railroad wanted Well the Remsen managers were afraid of bein
beaten and they went around offerin to make trades with senators and
assemblymen who had bills they were anxious to pass They came to me and
offered six votes for my Spuyten Duyvil Bill in exchange for my vote on
the Remsen Bill I took them up in a hurry and they felt pretty sore
afterwards when they heard I was goin to vote for the Remsen Bill
anyhow

A word about that Spuyten Duyvil BillI was criticized a lot for
introducin it They said I was workin in the interest of the New York
Central and was goin to get the contract for fillin in The fact is
that the fillin in was a good thing for the city and if it helped
the New York Central too what of it The railroad is a great public
institution and I was never an enemy of public institutions As to the
contract it hasnt come along yet If it does come it will find me at
home at all proper and reasonable hours if there is a good profit in
sight

The papers and some people are always ready to find wrong motives
in what us statesmen do If we bring about some big improvement that
benefits the city and it just happens as a sort of coincidence that we
make a few dollars out of the improvement they say we are grafters
But we are used to this kind of ingratitude It falls to the lot of all
statesmen especially Tammany statesmen All we can do is to bow our
heads in silence and wait till time has cleared our memories

Just think of mentionin dishonest graft in connection with the name of
George Washington Plunkitt the man who gave the city its magnificent
chain of parks its Washington Bridge its Speedway its Museum of
Natural History its One Hundred and Fiftyfifth Street Viaduct and its
West Side Courthouse 1 was the father of the bills that provided for
all these yet because I supported the Remsen and Spuyten Duyvil bills
some people have questioned my honest motives If thats the case how
can you expect legislators to fare who are not the fathers of the parks
the Washington Bridge the Speedway and the Viaduct

Now understand I aint defendin the senators who killed the
eightycent gas bill I dont know why they acted as they did I only
want to impress the idea to go slow before you make up your mind that a
man occupyin the exalted position that 1 held for so many years has
done wrong For all I know these senators may have been as honest and
high minded about the gas bill as I was about the Remsen and Spuyten
Duyvil bills



Chapter 16 Plunkitts Fondest Dream

The time is comm and though Im no youngster I may see it when New
York City will break away from the State and become a state itself Its
got to come The feelin between this city and the hayseeds that make
a livin by plunderin it is every bit as bitter as the feelin between
the North and South before the war And let me tell you if there aint
a peaceful separation before long we may have the horrors of civil war
right here in New York State Why I know a lot of men in my district
who would like nothin better today than to go out gunnin for hayseeds

New York City has got a bigger population than most of the states in the
Union Its got more wealth than any dozen of them Yet the people here
as I explained before are nothin but slaves of the Albany gang We
have stood the slavery a long long time but the uprisin is near at
hand It will be a fight for liberty just like the American Revolution
Well get liberty peacefully if we can by cruel war if we must

Just think how lovely things would be here if we had a Tammany Governor
and Legislature meetin say in the neighborhood of Fiftyninth Street
and a Tammany Mayor and Board of Aldermen doin business in City Hall
How sweet and peaceful everything would go on

The people wouldnt have to bother about nothin Tammany would take
care of everything for them in its nice quiet way You wouldnt hear of
any conflicts between the state and city authorities They would settle
everything pleasant and comfortable at Tammany Hall and every bill
introduced in the Legislature by Tammany would be sure to go through
The Republicans wouldnt count

Imagine how the city would be built up in a short time At present we
cant make a public improvement of any consequence without goin to
Albany for permission and most of the time we get turned down when we
go there But with a Tammany Governor and Legislature up at Fiftyninth
Street how public works would hum here The Mayor and Aldermen could
decide on an improvement telephone the Capitol have a bill put through
in a jiffy andthere you are We could have a state constitution too
which would extend the debt limit so that we could issue a whole lot
more bonds As things are now all the money spent for docks for
instance is charged against the city in calculatin the debt limit
although the Dock Department provides immense revenues Its the same
with some other departments This humbug would be dropped if Tammany
ruled at the Capitol and the City Hall and the city would have money to
burn

Another thingthe constitution of the new state wouldnt have a word
about civil service and if any man dared to introduce any kind of a
civil service bill in the Legislature he would be fired out the window
Then we would have government of the people by the people who were
elected to govern them Thats the kind of government Lincoln meant 0
what a glorious future for the city Whenever I think of it I feel like
goin out and celebratin and Im really almost sorry that I dont
drink

You may ask what would become of the upstate people if New York City
left them in the lurch and went into the State business on its own
account Well we wouldnt be under no obligation to provide for them
still I would be in favor of helpin them along for a while until they
could learn to work and earn an honest livin just like the United
States Government looks after the Indians These hayseeds have been so
used to livin off of New York City that they would be helpless after we
left them It wouldnt do to let them starve We might make some sort
of an appropriation for them for a few years but it would be with the
distinct understandin that they must get busy right away and learn
to support themselves If after say five years they werent
selfsupportin we could withdraw the appropriation and let them shift
for themselves The plan might succeed and it might not Wed be doin
our duty anyhow

Some persons might say But how about it if the hayseed politicians
moved down here and went in to get control of the government of the new
state We could provide against that easy by passin a law that these
politicians couldnt come below the Bronx without a sort of passport
limitin the time of their stay here and forbiddin them to monkey with
politics here I dont know just what kind of a bill would be required
to fix this but with a Tammany Constitution Governor Legislature and
Mayor there would be no trouble in settlin a little matter of that
sort

Say I dont wish I was a poet for if I was I guess Id be livin in
a garret on no dollars a week instead of runnin a great contractin
and transportation business which is doin pretty well thank you
but honest now the notion takes me sometimes to yell poetry of the
redhothailgloriousland kind when I think of New York City as a state
by itself



Chapter 17 Tammanys Patriotism

TAMMANYs the most patriotic organization on earth notwithstandin the
fact that the civil service law is sappin the foundations of patriotism
all over the country Nobody pays any attention to the Fourth of July
any longer except Tammany and the small boy When the Fourth comes the
reformers with Revolutionary names parted in the middle run off
to Newport or the Adirondacks to get out of the way of the noise and
everything that reminds them of the glorious day How different it is
with Tammany The very constitution of the Tammany Society requires that
we must assemble at the wigwam on the Fourth regardless of the weather
and listen to the readin of the Declaration of Independence and
patriotic speeches

You ought to attend one of these meetins Theyre a liberal education
in patriotism The great hall upstairs is filled with five thousand
people suffocatin from heat and smoke Every man Jack of these five
thousand knows that down in the basement theres a hundred cases of
champagne and two hundred kegs of beer ready to flow when the signal is
given Yet that crowd stick to their seats without turnin a hair
while for four solid hours the Declaration of Independence is read
longwinded orators speak and the glee dub sings itself hoarse

Talk about heroism in the battlefield That comes and passes away in a
moment You aint got time to be anything but heroic But just think of
five thousand men sittin in the hottest place on earth for four long
hours with parched lips and gnawin stomachs and knowin all the
time that the delights of the oasis in the desert were only two flights
downstairs Ah that is the highest kind of patriotism the patriotism
of long sufferin and endurance What man wouldnt rather face a cannon
for a minute or two than thirst for four hours with champagne and beer
almost under his nose

And then see how they applaud and yell when patriotic things are said
As soon as the man on the platform starts off with when in the
course of human events word goes around that its the Declaration of
Independence and a mighty roar goes up The Declaration aint a very
short document and the crowd has heard it on every Fourth but they give
it just as fine a send off as if it was brandnew and awful excitin
Then the long talkers get in their work that is two or three orators
who are good for an hour each Heat never has any effect on these men
They use every minute of their time Sometimes human nature gets the
better of a man in the audience and he begins to nod but he always
wakes up with a hurrah for the Declaration of Independence

The greatest hero of the occasion is the Grand Sachem of the Tammany
Society who presides He and the rest of us Sachems come on the stage
wearin stovepipe hats accordin to the constitution but we can shed
ours right off while the Grand Sachem is required to wear his hat all
through the celebration Have you any idea what that means Four hours
under a big silk hat in a hall where the heat registers 110 and the
smoke 250 And the Grand Sachem is expected to look pleasant all the
time and say nice things when introducin the speakers Often his hand
goes to his hat unconsciouslike then he catches himself up in time
and looks around like a man who is in the tenth story of a burnin
building seekin a way to escape I believe that FourthofJuly silk
hat shortened the life of one of our Grand Sachems the late Supreme
Court Justice Smyth and I know that one of our Sachems refused the
office of Grand Sachem because he couldnt get up sufficient patriotism
to perform this fourhour hat act You see theres degrees of
patriotism just as theres degrees in everything else

You dont hear of the Citizens Union people holdin FourthofJuly
celebrations under a fivepound silk hat or any other way do you The
Cits take the Fourth like a dog I had when I was a boy That dog knew
as much as some Cits and he acted just like them about the glorious day
Exactly fortyeight hours before each Fourth of July the dog left our
house on a run and hid himself in the Bronx woods The day after the
Fourth he turned up at home as regular as clockwork He must have known
what a dog is up against on the Fourth Anyhow he kept out of the way
The namepartedinthemiddle aristocrats act in just the same way
They dont want to be annoyed with firecrackers and the Declaration of
Independence and when they see the Fourth comm they hustle off to the
woods like my dog

Tammany dont only show its patriotism at FourthofJuly celebrations
Its always on deck when the country needs its services After the
SpanishAmerican War broke Out John J Scannell the Tammany leader of
the Twentyfifth District wrote to Governor Black offerin to raise a
Tammany regiment to go to the front If you want proof go to Tammany
Hall and see the beautiful set of engrossed resolutions about this
regiment Its true that the Governor didnt accept the offer but it
showed Tammanys patriotism Some enemies of the organization have said
that the offer to raise the regiment was made after the Governor let
it be known that no more volunteers were wanted but thats the talk of
envious slanderers

Now a word about Tammanys love for the American flag Did you ever
see Tammany Hall decorated for a celebration Its just a mass of flags
They even take down the window shades and put flags in place of them
Theres flags everywhere except on the floors We dont care for expense
where the American flag is concerned especially after we have won an
election In 1904 we originated the custom of givin a small flag to
each man as he entered Tammany Hall for the FourthofJuly celebration
It took like wildfire The men waved their flags whenever they cheered
and the sight made me feel so patriotic that I forgot all about civil
service for a while And the good work of the flags didnt stop there
The men carried them home and gave them to the children and the kids
got patriotic too Of course it all cost a pretty penny but what of
that We had won at the polls the precedin November had the offices
and could afford to make an extra investment in patriotism



Chapter 18 On the Use of Money in Politics

THE civil service gang is always howlin about candidates and
officeholders puttin up money for campaigns and about corporations
chippin in They might as well howl about givin contributions to
churches A political organization has to have money for its business as
well as a church and who has more right to put up than the men who get
the good things that are goin Take for instance a great political
concern like Tammany Hall It does missionary work like a church its
got big expenses and its got to be supported by the faithful If
a corporation sends in a check to help the good work of the Tammany
Society why shouldnt we take it like other missionary societies Of
course the day may come when well reject the money of the rich as
tainted but it hadnt come when I left Tammany Hall at 1125 AM
today

Not long ago some newspapers had fits became the Assemblyman from my
district said he had put up 500 when he was nominated for the Assembly
last year Every politician in town laughed at these papers I dont
think there was even a Citizens Union man who didnt know that
candidates of both parties have to chip in for campaign expenses The
sums they pay are accordin to their salaries and the length of their
terms of office if elected Even candidates for the Supreme Court have
to fall in line A Supreme Court Judge in New York County gets 17500
a year and hes expected when nominated to help along the good cause
with a years salary Why not He has fourteen years on the bench ahead
of him and ten thousand other lawyers would be willin to put up
twice as much to be in his shoes Now I aint sayin that we sell
nominations Thats a different thing altogether Theres no auction
and no regular biddin The man is picked out and somehow he gets to
understand whats expected of him in the way of a contribution and he
ponies upall from gratitude to the organization that honored him see

Let me tell you an instance that shows the difference between sellin
nominations and arrangin them in the way I described A few years ago a
Republican district leader controlled the nomination for Congress in his
Congressional district Four men wanted it At first the leader asked
for bids privately but decided at last that the best thing to do was to
get the four men together in the back room of a certain saloon and have
an open auction When he had his men lined up he got on a chair told
about the value of the goods for sale and asked for bids in regular
auctioneer style The highest bidder got the nomination for 5000 Now
that wasnt right at all These things ought to be always fixed up nice
and quiet

As to officeholders they would be ingrates if they didnt contribute to
the organization that put them in office They neednt be assessed That
would be against the law But they know whats expected of them and
if they happen to forget they can be reminded polite and courteous
Dan Donegan who used to be the Wiskinkie of the Tammany Society and
received contributions from grateful officeholders had a pleasant way
of remindin If a man forgot his duty to the organization that made
him Dan would call on the man smile as sweet as you please and say
You havent been round at the Hall lately have you If the man tried
to slide around the question Dan would say Its gettin awful cold
Then he would have a fit of shiverin and walk away What could be
more polite and at the same time more to the point No force no
threatsonly a little shiverin which any man is liable to even in
summer

Just here I want to charge one more crime to the infamous civil service
law It has made men turn ungrateful A dozen years ago when there
wasnt much civil service business in the city government and when
the administration could turn out almost any man holdin office Dans
shiver took effect every time and there was no ingratitude in the city
departments But when the civil service law came in and all the clerks
got leadpipe cinches on their jobs ingratitude spread right away
Dan shivered and shook till his bones rattled but many of the city
employees only laughed at him One day I remember he tackled a clerk
in the Public Works Department who used to give up pretty regular and
after the usual question began to shiver The clerk smiled Dan shook
till his hat fell off The clerk took ten cents out of his pocket
handed it to Dan and said Poor man Go and get a drink to warm
yourself up Wasnt that shameful And yet if it hadnt been for the
civil service law that clerk would be contributin right along to this
day

The civil service law dont cover everything however Theres lots of
good jobs outside its clutch and the men that get them are grateful
every time Im not speakin of Tammany Hall alone remember Its the
same with the Republican Federal and State officeholders and every
organization that has or has had jobs to give outexcept of course
the Citizens Union The Cits held office only a couple of years and
knowin that they would never be in again each Cit officeholder held on
for dear life to every dollar that came his way

Some people say they cant understand what becomes of all the money
thats collected for campaigns They would understand fast enough if
they were district leadem Theres never been half enough money to go
around Besides the expenses for meetins bands and all that theres
the bigger bill for the district workers who get men to the polls These
workers are mostly men who want to serve their country but cant get
jobs in the city departments on account of the civil service law They
do the next best thing by keepin track of the voters and seem that
they come to the polls and vote the right way Some of these deservin
citizens have to make enough on registration and election days to keep
them the rest of the year Isnt it right that they should get a share
of the campaign money

Just remember that theres thirtyfive Assembly districts in New York
County and thirtysix district leaders reachin out for the Tammany
doughbag for somethin to keep up the patriotism of ten thousand
workers and you wouldnt wonder that the cry for more more is goin
up from every district organization now and forevermore Amen



Chapter 19 The Successful Politician Does Not Drink

I HAVE explained how to succeed in politics I want to add that no
matter how well you learn to play the political game you wont make a
lastin success of it if youre a drinkin man I never take a drop
of any kind of intoxicatin liquor I aint no fanatic Some of the
saloonkeepers are my best friends and I dont mind goin into a saloon
any day with my friends But as a matter of business I leave whisky and
beer and the rest of that stuff alone As a matter of business too I
take for my lieutenants in my district men who dont drink I tried the
other kind for several years but it didnt pay They cost too much For
instance I had a young man who was one of the best hustlers in town He
knew every man in the district was popular everywhere and could induce
a halfdead man to come to the polls on election day But regularly
two weeks before election he started on a drunk and I had to hire two
men to guard him day and night and keep him sober enough to do his work
That cost a lot of money and I dropped the young man after a while

Maybe you think Im unpopular with the saloonkeepers because 1 dont
drink Youre wrong The most successful saloonkeepers dont drink
themselves and they understand that my temperance is a business
proposition just like their own I have a saloon under my headquarters
If a saloonkeeper gets into trouble he always knows that Senator
Plunkitt is the man to help him out If there is a bill in the
Legislature makin it easier for the liquor dealers I am for it every
time Im one of the best friends the saloon men havebut I dont drink
their whisky I wont go through the temperance lecture dodge and tell
you how many bright young men Ive seen fall victims to intemperance
but Ill tell you that I could name dozensyoung men who had started on
the road to statesmanship who could carry their districts every time
and who could turn out any vote you wanted at the primaries I honestly
believe that drink is the greatest curse of the day except of course
civil service and that it has driven more young men to ruin than
anything except civil service examinations

Look at the great leaders of Tammany Hall No regular drinkers among
them Richard Crokers strongest drink was vichy Charlie Murphy takes
a glass of wine at dinner sometimes but he dont go beyond that A
drinkin man wouldnt last two weeks as leader of Tammany Hall Nor can
a man manage an assembly district long if he drinks Hes got to have
a clear head all the time I could name ten men who in the last few
years lost their grip in their districts because they began drinkin
Theres now thirtysix district leaders in Tammany Hall and I dont
believe a halfdozen of them ever drink anything except at meals People
have got an idea that because the liquor men are with us in campaigns
our district leaders spend most of their time leanin against bars
There couldnt be a wronger idea The district leader makes a business
of politics gets his livin out of it and in order to succeed hes
got to keep sober just like in any other business

Just take as examples Big Tim and Little Tim Sullivan Theyre known
all over the country as the Bowery leaders and as theres nothin but
saloons on the Bowery people might think that they are hard drinkers
The fact is that neither of them has ever touched a drop of liquor in
his life of even smoked a cigar Still they dont make no pretenses
of being better than anybody else and dont go around deliverin
temperance lectures Big Tim made money out of liquorsellin it to
other people Thats the only way to get good out of liquor

Look at all the Tammany heads of city departments Theres not a real
drinkin man in the lot Oh yes there are some prominent men in the
organization who drink sometimes but they are not the men who have
power Theyre ornaments fancy speakers and all that who make a fine
show behind the footlights but am I in it when it comes to directin
the city government and the Tammany organization The men who sit in the
executive committee room at Tammany Hall and direct things are men
who celebrate on apollinaris or vichy Let me tell you what I saw on
election night in 1897 when the Tammany ticket swept the city Up to 10
PM Croker John F Carroll Tim Sullivan Charlie Murphy and myself
sat in the committee room receivin returns When nearly all the city
was heard from and we saw that Van Wyck was elected by a big majority
I invited the crowd to go across the street for a little celebration
A lot of small politicians followed us expectin to see magnums of
champagne opened The waiters in the restaurant expected it too and
you never saw a more disgusted lot of waiters when they got our orders
Heres the orders Croker vichy and bicarbonate of soda Carroll
seltzer lemonade Sullivan apollinaris Murphy vichy Plunkitt ditto
Before midnight we were all in bed and next mornin we were up bright
and early attendin to business while other men were nursin swelled
heads Is there anything the matter with temperance as a pure business
proposition



Chapter 20 Bosses Preserve the Nation

WHEN I retired from the Senate I thought I would take a good long
rest such a rest as a man needs who has held office for about forty
years and has held four different offices in one year and drawn
salaries from three of them at the same time Drawin so many salaries
is rather fatiguin you know and as I said I started out for a rest
but when I seen how things were goin in New York State and how a
great big black shadow hung over us I said to myself No rest for
you George Your work aint done Your country still needs you and you
mustnt lay down yet

What was the great big black shadow It was the primary election law
amended so as to knock out what are called the party bosses by lettin
in everybody at the primaries and givin control over them to state
officials Oh yes that is a good way to do up the socalled bosses
but have you ever thought what would become of the country if the
bosses were put out of business and their places were taken by a lot of
carttail orators and college graduates It would mean chaos It would
be just like takin a lot of drygoods clerks and settin them to run
express trains on the New York Central Railroad It makes my heart bleed
to think of it Ignorant people are always talkin against party bosses
but just wait till the bosses are gone Then and not until then will
they get the right sort of epitaphs as Patrick Henry or Robert Emmet
said

Look at the bosses of Tammany Hall in the last twenty years What
magnificent men To them New York City owes pretty much all it is
today John Kelly Richard Croker and Charles F Murphywhat names in
American history compares with them except Washington and Lincoln They
built up the grand Tammany organization and the organization built up
New York Suppose the city had to depend for the last twenty years on
irresponsible concerns like the Citizens Union where would it be
now You can make a pretty good guess if you recall the Strong and Low
administrations when there was no boss and the heads of departments
were at odds all the time with each other and the Mayor was at odds
with the lot of them They spent so much time in arguin and makin
grandstand play that the interests of the city were forgotten Another
administration of that kind would put New York back a quarter of a
century

Then see how beautiful a Tammany city government runs with a socalled
boss directin the whole shootin match The machinery moves so
noiseless that you wouldnt think there was any If theres any
differences of opinion the Tammany leader settles them quietly and his
orders go every time How nice it is for the people to feel that they
can get up in the mornin without hem afraid of seem in the
papers that the Commissioner of Water Supply has sandbagged the Dock
Commissioner and that the Mayor and heads of the departments have been
taken to the police court as witnesses Thats no joke I remember that
under Strong some commissioners came very near sandbaggin one another

Of course the newspapers like the reform administration Why Because
these administrations with their daily rows furnish as racy news as
prizefights or divorce cases Tammany dont care to get in the papers
It goes right along attendin to business quietly and only wants to be
let alone Thats one reason why the papers are against us

Some papers complain that the bosses get rich while devotin their lives
to the interests of the city What of it If opportunities for turnin
an honest dollar comes their way why shouldnt they take advantage of
them just as I have done As I said in another talk there is honest
graft and dishonest graft The bosses go in for the former There is
so much of it in this big town that they would be fools to go in for
dishonest graft

Now the primary election law threatens to do away with the boss and
make the city government a menagerie Thats why I cant take the rest
I counted on Im goin to propose a bill for the next session of the
legislature repealin this dangerous law and leavin the primaries
entirely to the organizations themselves as they used to be Then will
return the good old times when our district leaders could have nice
comfortable primary elections at some place selected by themselves and
let in only men that they approved of as good Democrats Who is a better
judge of the Democracy of a man who offers his vote than the leader of
the district Who is better equipped to keep out undesirable voters

The men who put through the primary law are the same crowd that stand
for the civil service blight and they have the same objects in viewthe
destruction of governments by party the downfall of the constitution
and hell generally



Chapter 21 Concerning Excise

ALTHOUGH Im not a drinkin man myself I mourn with the poor liquor
dealers of New York City who are taxed and oppressed for the benefit
of the farmers up the state The Raines liquor law is infamous It takes
away nearly all the profits of the saloonkeepers and then turns in a
large part of the money to the State treasury to relieve the hayseeds
from taxes Ah who knows how many honest hardworkin saloonkeepers
have been driven to untimely graves by this law I know personally of a
halfdozen who committed suicidebecause they couldnt pay the enormous
license fee and I have heard of many others Every time there is an
increase of the fee there is an increase in the suicide record of the
city Now some of these Republican hayseeds are talkin about makin
the liquor tax 1500 or even 2000 a year That would mean the suicide
of half of the liquor dealers in the city

Just see how these poor fellows are oppressed all around First
liquor is taxed in the hands of the manufacturer by the United States
Government second the wholesale dealer pays a special tax to the
government third the retail dealer is specially taxed by the United
States Government fourth the retail dealer has to pay a big tax to the
State government

Now liquor dealing is criminal or it aint If its criminal the men
engaged in it ought to be sent to prison If it aint criminal they
ought to be protected and encouraged to make all the profit they
honestly can If its right to tax a saloonkeeper 1000 its right
to put a heavy tax on dealers in other beveragesin milk for
instanceand make the dairymen pay up But what a howl would be raised
if a bill was introduced in Albany to compel the farmers to help support
the State government What would be said of a law that put a tax of say
60 on a grocer 150 on a drygoods man and 500 more if he includes
the other goods that are kept in a country store

If the Raines law gave the money extorted from the saloonkeepers to the
city there might be some excuse for the tax We would get some benefit
from it but it gives a big part of the tax to local option localities
where the people are always shoutin that liquor dealin is immoral
Ought these good people be subjected to the immoral influence of money
taken from the saloon tainted money Out of respect for the tender
consciences of these pious people the Raines law ought to exempt them
from all contamination from the plunder that comes from the saloon
traffic Say mark that sarcastic Some people who aint used to fine
sarcasm might think I meant it

The Raines people make a pretense that the high license fee promotes
temperance Its just the other way around It makes more intemperance
and what is as bad it makes a monopoly in dram shops Soon the saloons
will be in the hands of a vast trust and any stuff can be sold for
whisky or beer Its gettin that way already Some of the poor liquor
dealers in my district have been forced to sell wood alcohol for whisky
and many deaths have followed A halfdozen men died in a couple of days
from this kind of whisky which was forced down their throats by the
high liquor tax If they raise the tax higher wood alcohol will be too
costly and I guess some dealers will have to get down to kerosene oil
and add to the Rockefeller millions

The way the Raines law divides the different classes of licenses is
also an outrage The sumptuous hotel saloons with 10000 paintins and
brickybrac and Oriental splendors gets off easier than a shanty on
the rocks by the waters edge in my district where boatmen drink their
grog and the only ornaments is a threecornered mirror nailed to the
wall and a chromo of the fight between Tom Hyer and Yankee Sullivan
Besides a premium is put on places that sell liquor not to be drunk on
the premises but to be taken home Now I want to declare that from
my experience in New York City I would rather see rum sold in the
dramshops unlicenced provided the rum is swallowed on the spot than
to encourage by a low tax bucketshops from which the stuff is
carried into the tenements at all hours of the day and night and make
drunkenness and debauchery among the women and children A bucketshop
in the tenement district means a cheap socalled distillery where raw
spirits poisonous colorin matter and water are sold for brandy and
whisky at ten cents a quart and carried away in buckets and pitchers
I have always noticed that there are many undertakers wherever the
bucketshop flourishes and they have no dull seasons

I want it understood that Im not an advocate of the liquor dealers or
of drinkin I think every man would be better off if he didnt take
any intoxicatin drink at all but as men will drink they ought to have
good stuff without impoverishin themselves by goin to fancy places
and without riskin death by goin to poor places The State should
look after their interests as well as the interests of those who drink
nothin stronger than milk Now as to the liquor dealers themselves
They aint the criminals that cantin hypocrites say they are I know
lots of them and I know that as a rule theyre good honest citizens
who conduct their business in a straight honorable way At a convention
of the liquor dealers a few years ago a big city official welcomed them
on behalf of the city and said Go on elevatin your standard higher
and higher Go on with your good work Heaven will bless YOU That was
puttin it just a little strong but the sentiment was all right and I
guess the speaker went a bit further than he intended in his enthusiasm
over meetin such a fine set of men and perhaps dinin with them



Chapter 22 A Parting Word on the Future of the Democratic Party in
America

THE Democratic party of the nation aint dead though its been givin
a lifelike imitation of a corpse for several years It cant die while
its got Tammany for its backbone The trouble is that the partys been
chasm after theories and stayin up nights readin books instead of
studyin human nature and actin accordin as Ive advised in tellin
how to hold your district In two Presidential campaigns the leaders
talked themselves red in the face about silver bein the best money and
gold hem no good and they tried to prove it out of books Do you think
the people cared for all that guff No They heartily indorsed what
Richard Croker said at die Hoffman House one day in 1900 Whats the
use of discussin whats the best kind of money said Croker Im
in favor of all kinds of moneythe more the better See how a real
Tammany statesman can settle in twentyfive words a problem that
monopolized two campaigns

Then imperialism The Democratic party spent all its breath on that in
the last national campaign Its position was all right sure but you
cant get people excited about the Philippines Theyve got too much at
home to interest them theyre too busy makin a livin to bother
about the niggers in the Pacific The partys got to drop all them
putyoutosleep issues and come out in 1908 for somethin that will
wake the people up somethin that will make it worth while to work for
the party

Theres just one issue that would set this country on fire The
Democratic party should say in the first plank of its platform We
hereby declare in national convention assembled that the paramount
issue now always and forever is the abolition of the iniquitous and
villainous civil service laws which are destroyin all patriotism ruin
in the country and takin away good jobs from them that earn them We
pledge ourselves if our ticket is elected to repeal those laws at once
and put every civil service reformer in jail

Just imagine the wild enthusiasm of the party if that plank was
adapted and the rush of Republicans to join us in restorin our country
to what it was before this college professors nightmare called civil
service reform got hold of it Of course it would be all right to
work in the platform some stuff about the tariff and sound money and the
Philippines as no platform seems to be complete without them but they
wouldnt count The people would read only the first plank and then
hanker for election day to come to put the Democratic party in office

I see a vision I see the civil service monster lyin flat on the
ground I see the Democratic party standin over it with foot on its
neck and wearin the crown of victory I see Thomas Jefferson lookin
out from a cloud and sayin Give him another sockdologer finish
him And I see millions of men wavin their hats and singin Glory
Hallelujah



Chapter 23 Strenuous Life of the Tammany District Leader

Note This chapter is based on extracts from Plunkitts Diary and on my
daily observation of the work of the district leaderWLR

THE life of the Tammany district leader is strenuous To his work is due
the wonderful recuperative power of the organization

One year it goes down in defeat and the prediction is made that it will
never again raise its head The district leader undaunted by defeat
collects his scattered forces organizes them as only Tammany knows
how to organize and in a little while the organization is as strong as
ever

No other politician in New York or elsewhere is exactly like the Tammany
district leader or works as he does As a rule he has no business or
occupation other than politics He plays politics every day and night in
the year and his headquarters bears the inscription Never closed

Everybody in the district knows him Everybody knows where to find him
and nearly everybody goes to him for assistance of one sort or another
especially the poor of the tenements

He is always obliging He will go to the police courts to put in a good
word for the drunks and disorderlies or pay their fines if a good
word is not effective He will attend christenings weddings and
funerals He will feed the hungry and help bury the dead

A philanthropist Not at all He is playing politics all the time

Brought up in Tammany Hall he has learned how to reach the hearts of
the great mass of voters He does not bother about reaching their heads
It is his belief that arguments and campaign literature have never
gained votes

He seeks direct contact with the people does them good turns when he
can and relies on their not forgetting him on election day His heart
is always in his work too for his subsistence depends on its results

If he holds his district and Tammany is in power he is amply rewarded
by a good office and the opportunities that go with it What these
opportunities are has been shown by the quick rise to wealth of so
many Tammany district leaders With the examples before him of Richard
Croker once leader of the Twentieth District John F Carroll formerly
leader of the Twentyninth Timothy Dry Dollar Sullivan late leader
of the Sixth and many others he can always look forward to riches and
ease while he is going through the drudgery of his daily routine

This is a record of a days work by Plunkitt

2 AM Aroused from sleep by the ringing Of his doorbell went to the
door and found a bartender who asked him to go to the police station
and ball out a saloonkeeper who had been arrested for violating the
excise law Furnished bail and returned to bed at three oclock

6AM Awakened by fire engines passing his house Hastened to the
scene of the fire according to the custom of the Tammany district
leaders to give assistance to the fire sufferers if needed Met
several of his election district captains who are always under orders
to look out for fires which are considered great votegetters Found
several tenants who had been burned out took them to a hotel supplied
them with clothes fed them and arranged temporary quarters for them
until they could rent and furnish new apartments

830 AM Went to the police court to look after his constituents
Found six drunks Secured the discharge of four by a timely word with
the judge and paid the fines of two

9 AM Appeared in the Municipal District Court Directed one of his
district captains to act as counsel for a widow against whom dispossess
proceedings had been instituted and obtained an extension of time
Paid the rent of a poor family about to be dispossessed and gave them a
dollar for food

11 AM At home again Found four men waiting for him One had been
discharged by the Metropolitan Rail way Company for neglect of duty and
wanted the district leader to fix things Another wanted a job on the
road The third sought a place on the Subway and the fourth a plumber
was looking for work with the Consolidated Gas Company The district
leader spent nearly three hours fixing things for the four men and
succeeded in each case

3 PM Attended the funeral of an Italian as far as the ferry Hurried
back to make his appearance at the funeral of a Hebrew constituent
Went conspicuously to the front both in the Catholic church and the
synagogue and later attended the Hebrew confirmation ceremonies in the
synagogue

7 PM Went to district headquarters and presided over a meeting of
election district captains Each captain submitted a list of all the
voters in his district reported on their attitude toward Tammany
suggested who might be won over and how they could be won told who were
in need and who were in trouble of any kind and the best way to reach
them District leader took notes and gave orders

8 PM Went to a church fair Took chances on everything bought ice
cream for the young girls and the children Kissed the little ones
flattered their mother and took their fathers out for something down at
the comer

9 PM At the clubhouse again Spent 10 on tickets for a church
excursion and promised a subscription for a new church bell Bought
tickets for a baseball game to be played by two nines from his district
Listened to the complaints of a dozen pushcart peddlers who said they
were persecuted by the police and assured them he would go to Police
Headquarter in the morning and see about it

1030 PM Attended a Hebrew wedding reception and dance Had
previously sent a handsome wedding present to the bride

12 PM In bed

That is the actual record of one day in the life Of Plunkitt He does
some of the same things every day but his life is not so monotonous as
to be wearisome Sometimes the work of a district leader is exciting
especially if he happens to have a rival who intends to make a contest
for the leadership at the primaries In that case he is even more
alert tries to reach the fires before his rival sends out runners to
look for drunks and disorderlies at the police stations and keeps a
very dose watch on the obituary columns of the newspapers A few years
ago there was a bitter contest for the Tammany leadership of the Ninth
District between John C Sheehan and Frank J Goodwin Both had had long
experience in Tammany politics and both understood every move of the
game

Every morning their agents went to their respective headquarters before
seven oclock and read through the death notices in all the morning
papers If they found that anybody in the district had died they rushed
to the homes of their principals with the information and then there was
a race to the house of the deceased to offer condolences and if the
family were poor something more substantial

On the day of the funeral there was another contest Each faction tried
to surpass the other in the number and appearance of the carriages it
sent to the funeral and more than once they almost came to blows at the
church or in the cemetery

On one occasion the Goodwinites played a trick on their adversaries
which has since been imitated in other districts A wellknown liquor
dealer who had a considerable following died and both Sheehan and
Goodwin were eager to become his political heir by making a big showing
at the funeral

Goodwin managed to catch the enemy napping He went to all the livery
stables in the district hired all the carriages for the day and gave
orders to two hundred of his men to be on hand as mourners

Sheehan had never had any trouble about getting all the carriages that
he wanted so he let the matter go until the night before the funeral
Then he found that he could not hire a carriage in the district

He called his district committee together in a hurry and explained
the situation to them He could get all the vehicles he needed in the
adjoining district he said but if he did that Goodwin would rouse
the voters of the Ninth by declaring that he Sheehan had patronized
foreign industries

Finally it was decided that there was nothing to do but to go over to
Sixth Avenue and Broadway for carriages Sheehan made a fine turnout
at the funeral but the deceased was hardly in his grave before Goodwin
raised the cry of Protection to home industries and denounced his
rival for patronizing liverystable keepers outside of his district The
err had its effect in the primary campaign At all events Goodwin was
elected leader

A recent contest for the leadership of the Second District illustrated
further the strenuous work of the Tammany district leaders The
contestants were Patrick Divver who had managed the district for years
and Thomas F Foley

Both were particularly anxious to secure the large Italian vote They
not only attended all the Italian christenings and funerals but also
kept a close lookout for the marriages in order to be on hand with
wedding presents

At first each had his own reporter in the Italian quarter to keep track
of the marriages Later Foley conceived a better plan He hired a man
to stay all day at the City Hall marriage bureau where most Italian
couples go through the civil ceremony and telephone to him at his
saloon when anything was doing at the bureau

Foley had a number of presents ready for use and whenever he received a
telephone message from his man he hastened to the City Hall with a
ring or a watch or a piece of silver and handed it to the bride with his
congratulations As a consequence when Divver got the news and went to
the home of the couple with his present he always found that Foley had
been ahead of him Toward the end of the campaign Divver also stationed
a man at the marriage bureau and then there were daily foot races and
fights between the two heelers

Sometimes the rivals came into conflict at the deathbed One night a
poor Italian peddler died in Roosevelt Street The news reached Divver
and Foley about the same time and as they knew the family of the
man was destitute each went to an undertaker and brought him to the
Roosevelt Street tenement

The rivals and the undertakers met at the house and an altercation
ensued After much discussion the Divver undertaker was selected Foley
had more carriages at the funeral however and he further impressed the
Italian voters by paying the widows rent for a month and sending her
half a ton of coal and a barrel of flour

The rivals were put on their mettle toward the end of the campaign by
the wedding of a daughter of one of the original Cohens of the Baxter
Street region The Hebrew vote in the district is nearly as large as
the Italian vote and Divver and Foley set out to capture the Cohens and
their friends

They stayed up nights thinking what they would give the bride Neither
knew how much the other was prepared to spend on a wedding present or
what form it would take so spies were employed by both sides to keep
watch on the jewelry stores and the jewelers of the district were
bribed by each side to impart the desired information

At last Foley heard that Divver had purchased a set of silver knives
forks and spoons He at once bought a duplicate set and added a silver
tea service When the presents were displayed at the home of the bride
Divver was not in a pleasant mood and he charged his jeweler with
treachery It may be added that Foley won at the primaries

One of the fixed duties of a Tammany district leader is to give two
outings every summer one for the men of his district and the other for
the women and children and a beefsteak dinner and a ball every winter
The scene of the outings is usually one of the groves along the Sound

The ambition of the district leader on these occasions is to demonstrate
that his men have broken all records in the matter of eating and
drinking He gives out the exact number of pounds of beef poultry
butter etc that they have consumed and professes to know how many
potatoes and ears of corn have been served

According to his figures the average eating record of each man at the
outing is about ten pounds of beef two or three chickens a pound
of butter a half peck of potatoes and two dozen ears of corn The
drinking records as given out are still more phenomenal For
some reason not yet explained the district leader thinks that his
popularity will be greatly increased if he can show that his followers
can eat and drink more than the followers of any other district leader

The same idea governs the beefsteak dinners in the winter It matters
not what sort of steak is served or how it is cooked the district
leader considers only the question of quantity and when he excels all
others in this particular he feels somehow that he is a bigger man
and deserves more patronage than his associates in the Tammany Executive
Committee

As to the balls they are the events of the winter in the extreme East
Side and West Side society Mamie and Maggie and Jennie prepare for them
months in advance and their young men save up for the occasion just as
they save for the summer trips to Coney Island

The district leader is in his glory at the opening of the ball He leads
the cotillion with the prettiest woman presenthis wife if he has one
permittingand spends almost the whole night shaking hands with his
constituents The ball costs him a pretty penny but he has found that
the investment pays

By these means the Tammany district leader reaches out into the homes of
his district keeps watch not only on the men but also on the women and
children knows their needs their likes and dislikes their troubles
and their hopes and places himself in a position to use his knowledge
for the benefit of his organization and himself Is it any wonder
that scandals do not permanently disable Tammany and that it speedily
recovers from what seems to be crushing defeat
