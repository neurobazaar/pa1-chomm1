FLIP A CALIFORNIA ROMANCE


By Bret Harte




CHAPTER I


Just where the track of the Los Gatos road streams on and upward like
the sinuous trail of a fiery rocket until it is extinguished in the blue
shadows of the Coast Range there is an embayed terrace near the summit
hedged by dwarf firs At every bend of the heatladen road the eye
rested upon it wistfully all along the flank of the mountain which
seemed to pant and quiver in the ovenlike air through rising dust the
slow creaking of dragging wheels the monotonous cry of tired springs
and the muffled beat of plunging hoofs it held out a promise of
sheltered coolness and green silences beyond Sunburned and anxious
faces yearned toward it from the dizzy swaying tops of stagecoaches
from lagging teams far below from the blinding white canvas covers of
mountain schooners and from scorching saddles that seemed to weigh
down the scrambling sweating animals beneath But it would seem that
the hope was vain the promise illusive When the terrace was reached it
appeared not only to have caught and gathered all the heat of the
valley below but to have evolved a fire of its own from some hidden
craterlike source unknown Nevertheless instead of prostrating and
enervating man and beast it was said to have induced the wildest
exaltation The heated air was filled and stifling with resinous
exhalations The delirious spices of balm bay spruce juniper yerba
buena wild syringa and strange aromatic herbs as yet unclassified
distilled and evaporated in that mighty heat and seemed to fire with
a midsummer madness all who breathed their fumes They stung smarted
stimulated intoxicated It was said that the most jaded and footsore
horses became furious and ungovernable under their influence wearied
teamsters and muleteers who had exhausted their profanity in the
ascent drank fresh draughts of inspiration in this fiery air extended
their vocabulary and created new and startling forms of objurgation
It is recorded that one bibulous stagedriver exhausted description
and condensed its virtues in a single phrase Gin and ginger This
felicitous epithet flung out in a generous comparison with his favorite
drink rum and gum clung to it ever after

Such was the current comment on this vale of spices Like most human
criticism it was hasty and superficial No one yet had been known to
have penetrated deeply its mysterious recesses It was still far below
the summit and its wayside inn It had escaped the intruding foot of
hunter and prospector and the inquisitive patrol of the county surveyor
had only skirted its boundary It remained for Mr Lance Harriott to
complete its exploration His reasons for so doing were simple He had
made the journey thither underneath the stagecoach and clinging to its
axle He had chosen this hazardous mode of conveyance at night as the
coach crept by his place of concealment in the wayside brush to elude
the sheriff of Monterey County and his posse who were after him

He had not made himself known to his fellowpassengers as they already
knew him as a gambler an outlaw and a desperado he deemed it unwise
to present himself in a newer reputation of a man who had just slain
a brother gambler in a quarrel and for whom a reward was offered
He slipped from the axle as the stagecoach swirled past the brushing
branches of fir and for an instant lay unnoticed a scarcely
distinguishable mound of dust in the broken furrows of the road Then
more like a beast than a man he crept on his hands and knees into the
steaming underbrush Here he lay still until the clatter of harness
and the sound of voices faded in the distance Had he been followed
it would have been difficult to detect in that inert mass of rags any
semblance to a known form or figure A hideous reddish mask of dust and
clay obliterated his face his hands were shapeless stumps exaggerated
in his trailing sleeves And when he rose staggering like a drunken
man and plunged wildly into the recesses of the wood a cloud of dust
followed him and pieces and patches of his frayed and rotten garments
clung to the impeding branches Twice he fell but maddened and upheld
by the smarting spices and stimulating aroma of the air he kept on his
course

Gradually the heat became less oppressive once when he stopped and
leaned exhaustedly against a sapling he fancied he saw the zephyr he
could not yet feel in the glittering and trembling of leaves in the
distance before him Again the deep stillness was moved with a faint
sighing rustle and he knew he must be nearing the edge of the thicket
The spell of silence thus broken was followed by a fainter more musical
interruptionthe glassy tinkle of water A step further his foot
trembled on the verge of a slight ravine still closely canopied by the
interlacing boughs overhead A tiny stream that he could have dammed
with his hand yet lingered in this parched red gash in the hillside and
trickled into a deep irregular welllike cavity that again overflowed
and sent its slight surplus on It had been the luxurious retreat of
many a spotted trout it was to be the bath of Lance Harriott Without
a moments hesitation without removing a single garment he slipped
cautiously into it as if fearful of losing a single drop His head
disappeared from the level of the bank the solitude was again unbroken
Only two objects remained upon the edge of the ravinehis revolver and
tobacco pouch

A few minutes elapsed A fearless blue jay alighted on the bank and
made a prospecting peck at the tobacco pouch It yielded in favor of a
gopher who endeavored to draw it toward his hole but in turn gave way
to a red squirrel whose attention was divided however between the
pouch and the revolver which he regarded with mischievous fascination
Then there was a splash a grunt a sudden dispersion of animated
nature and the head of Mr Lance Harriott appeared above the bank It
was a startling transformation Not only that he had by this wholesale
process washed himself and his light drill garments entirely clean
but that he had apparently by the same operation morally cleansed
HIMSELF and left every stain and ugly blot of his late misdeeds and
reputation in his bath His face albeit scratched here and there was
rosy round shining with irrepressible good humor and youthful levity
His large blue eyes were infantine in their innocent surprise and
thoughtlessness Dripping yet with water and panting he rested his
elbows lazily on the bank and became instantly absorbed with a boys
delight in the movements of the gopher who after the first alarm
returned cautiously to abduct the tobacco pouch If any familiar had
failed to detect Lance Harriott in this hideous masquerade of dust and
grime and tatters still less would any passing stranger have recognized
in this blond faun the possible outcast and murderer And when with a
swirl of his spattering sleeve he drove back the gopher in a shower of
spray and leaped to the bank he seemed to have accepted his felonious
hidingplace as a mere picnicking bower

A slight breeze was unmistakably permeating the wood from the west
Looking in that direction Lance imagined that the shadow was less dark
and although the undergrowth was denser he struck off carelessly toward
it As he went on the wood became lighter and lighter branches and
presently leaves were painted against the vivid blue of the sky He
knew he must be near the summit stopped felt for his revolver and
then lightly put the few remaining branches aside

The full glare of the noonday sun at first blinded him When he could
see more clearly he found himself on the open western slope of the
mountain which in the Coast Range was seldom wooded The spiced thicket
stretched between him and the summit and again between him and the
stage road that plunges from the terrace like forked lightning into the
valley below He could command all the approaches without being seen
Not that this seemed to occupy his thoughts or cause him any anxiety
His first act was to disencumber himself of his tattered coat he then
filled and lighted his pipe and stretched himself fulllength on the
open hillside as if to bleach in the fierce sun While smoking he
carelessly perused the fragment of a newspaper which had enveloped his
tobacco and being struck with some amusing paragraph read it half
aloud again to some imaginary auditor emphasizing its humor with an
hilarious slap upon his leg

Possibly from the relaxation of fatigue and the bath which had become
a vapor one as he alternately rolled and dried himself in the baking
grass his eyes closed dreamily He was awakened by the sound of voices
They were distant they were vague they approached no nearer He rolled
himself to the verge of the first precipitous grassy descent There was
another bank or plateau below him and then a confused depth of olive
shadows pierced here and there by the spiked helmets of pines

There was no trace of habitation yet the voices were those of some
monotonous occupation and Lance distinctly heard through them the click
of crockery and the ring of some household utensil It appeared to be
the interjectional half listless half perfunctory domestic dialogue
of an old man and a girl of which the words were unintelligible Their
voices indicated the solitude of the mountain but without sadness they
were mysterious without being aweinspiring They might have uttered
the dreariest commonplaces but in their vast isolation they seemed
musical and eloquent Lance drew his first sighthey had suggested
dinner

Careless as his nature was he was too cautious to risk detection in
broad daylight He contented himself for the present with endeavoring to
locate that particular part of the depths from which the voices seemed
to rise It was more difficult however to select some other way of
penetrating it than by the stage road Theyre bound to have a fire
or show a light when its dark he reasoned and satisfied with that
reflection lay down again Presently he began to amuse himself by
tossing some silver coins in the air Then his attention was directed to
a spur of the Coast Range which had been sharply silhouetted against
the cloudless western sky Something intensely white something so
small that it was scarcely larger than the silver coin in his hand was
appearing in a slight cleft of the range

While he looked it gradually filled and obliterated the cleft In
another moment the whole serrated line of mountain had disappeared The
dense dazzling white encompassing host began to pour over and down
every ravine and pass of the coast Lance recognized the seafog and
knew that scarcely twenty miles away lay the oceanand safety The
drooping sun was now caught and hidden in its soft embraces A sudden
chill breathed over the mountain He shivered rose and plunged again
for very warmth into the spiceladen thicket The heated balsamic air
began to affect him like a powerful sedative his hunger was forgotten
in the languor of fatigue he slumbered When he awoke it was dark He
groped his way through the thicket A few stars were shining directly
above him but beyond and below everything was lost in the soft white
fleecy veil of fog Whatever light or fire might have betokened human
habitation was hidden To push on blindly would be madness he could
only wait for morning It suited the outcasts lazy philosophy He crept
back again to his bed in the hollow and slept In that profound silence
and shadow shut out from human association and sympathy by the ghostly
fog what torturing visions conjured up by remorse and fear should have
pursued him What spirit passed before him or slowly shaped itself out
of the infinite blackness of the wood None As he slipped gently into
that blackness he remembered with a slight regret some biscuits that
were dropped from the coach by a careless luncheonconsuming passenger
That pang over he slept as sweetly as profoundly as divinely as a
child




CHAPTER II


He awoke with the aroma of the woods still steeping his senses His
first instinct was that of all young animals he seized a few of the
young tender green leaves of the yerba buena vine that crept over his
mossy pillow and ate them being rewarded by a half berrylike flavor
that seemed to soothe the cravings of his appetite The languor of sleep
being still upon him he lazily watched the quivering of a sunbeam that
was caught in the canopying boughs above Then he dozed again Hovering
between sleeping and waking he became conscious of a slight movement
among the dead leaves on the bank beside the hollow in which he lay The
movement appeared to be intelligent and directed toward his revolver
which glittered on the bank Amused at this evident return of his
larcenous friend of the previous day he lay perfectly still The
movement and rustle continued but it now seemed long and undulating
Lances eyes suddenly became set he was intensely keenly awake It
was not a snake but the hand of a human arm half hidden in the moss
groping for the weapon In that flash of perception he saw that it was
small bare and deeply freckled In an instant he grasped it firmly
and rose to his feet dragging to his own level as he did so the
struggling figure of a young girl

Leave me go she said more ashamed than frightened

Lance looked at her She was scarcely more than fifteen slight and
lithe with a boyish flatness of breast and back Her flushed face and
bare throat were absolutely peppered with minute brown freckles
like grains of spent gunpowder Her eyes which were large and gray
presented the singular spectacle of being also freckledat least they
were shot through in pupil and cornea with tiny spots like powdered
allspice Her hair was even more remarkable in its tawny deerskin
color full of lighter shades and bleached to the faintest of blondes
on the crown of her head as if by the action of the sun She had
evidently outgrown her dress which was made for a smaller child and
the too brief skirt disclosed a bare freckled and sandy desert of
shapely limb for which the darned stockings were equally too scant
Lance let his grasp slip from her thin wrist to her hand and then with
a goodhumored gesture tossed it lightly back to her

She did not retreat but continued looking at him in a halfsurly
embarrassment

I aint a bit frightened she said Im not going to run awaydont
you fear

Glad to hear it said Lance with unmistakable satisfaction but why
did you go for my revolver

She flushed again and was silent Presently she began to kick the earth
at the roots of the tree and said as if confidentially to her foot

I wanted to get hold of it before you did

You didand why

Oh you know why

Every tooth in Lances head showed that he did perfectly But he was
discreetly silent

I didnt know what you were hiding there for she went on still
addressing the tree and looking at him sideways under her white
lashes I didnt see your face

This subtle compliment was the first suggestion of her artful sex
It actually sent the blood into the careless rascals face and for a
moment confused him He coughed So you thought youd freeze on to that
sixshooter of mine until you saw my hand

She nodded Then she picked up a broken hazel branch fitted it into the
small of her back threw her tanned bare arms over the ends of it and
expanded her chest and her biceps at the same moment This simple action
was supposed to convey an impression at once of ease and muscular force

Perhaps youd like to take it now said Lance handing her the pistol

Ive seen sixshooters before now said the girl evading the
proffered weapon and its suggestion Dad has one and my brother had
two derringers before he was half as big as me

She stopped to observe in her companion the effect of this capacity of
her family to bear arms Lance only regarded her amusedly Presently she
again spoke abruptly

What made you eat that grass just now

Grass echoed Lance

Yes there pointing to the yerba buena

Lance laughed I was hungry Look he said gayly tossing some silver
into the air Do you think you could get me some breakfast for that
and have enough left to buy something for yourself

The girl eyed the money and the man with halfbashful curiosity

I reckon Dad might give ye suthing if he had a mind ter though ez a
rule hes down on tramps ever since they run off his chickens Ye might
try

But I want YOU to try You can bring it to me here

The girl retreated a step dropped her eyes and with a smile that was
a charming hesitation between bashfulness and impudence said So you
ARE hidin are ye

Thats just it Your heads level I am laughed Lance unconcernedly

Yur aint one o the McCarty gangare ye

Mr Lance Harriott felt a momentary moral exaltation in declaring
truthfully that he was not one of a notorious band of mountain
freebooters known in the district under that name

Nor ye aint one of them chicken lifters that raided Hendersons ranch
We dont go much on that kind o cattle yer

No said Lance cheerfully

Nor ye aint that chap ez beat his wife unto death at Santa Clara

Lance honestly scorned the imputation Such conjugal ill treatment as
he had indulged in had not been physical and had been with other mens
wives

There was a moments further hesitation on the part of the girl Then
she said shortly

Well then I reckon you kin come along with me

Where asked Lance

To the ranch she replied simply

Then you wont bring me anything to eat here

What for You kin get it down there Lance hesitated I tell you its
all right she continued Ill make it all right with Dad

But suppose I reckon Id rather stay here persisted Lance with a
perfect consciousness however of affectation in his caution

Stay away then said the girl coolly only as Dad perempted this yer
woods

PREempted suggested Lance

Perempted or preempted as you like continued the girl
scornfullyez hes got a holt on this yer woods ye might ez well see
him down thar ez here For here hes like to come any minit You can bet
your life on that

She must have read Lances amusement in his eyes for she again dropped
her own with a frown of brusque embarrassment Come along then Im
your man said Lance gayly extending his hand

She would not accept it eying it however furtively like a horse
about to shy Hand me your pistol first she said

He handed it to her with an assumption of gayety She received it on her
part with unfeigned seriousness and threw it over her shoulder like
a gun This combined action of the child and heroine it is quite
unnecessary to say afforded Lance undiluted joy

You go first she said

Lance stepped promptly out with a broad grin Looks kinder as if I was
a prisoner dont it he suggested

Go on and dont fool she replied

The two fared onward through the wood For one moment he entertained the
facetious idea of appearing to rush frantically away just to see
what the girl would do but abandoned it Its an even thing if she
wouldnt spot me the first pop he reflected admiringly

When they had reached the open hillside Lance stopped inquiringly
This way she said pointing toward the summit and in quite an
opposite direction to the valley where he had heard the voices one
of which he now recognized as hers They skirted the thicket for a few
moments and then turned sharply into a trail which began to dip toward
a ravine leading to the valley

Why do you have to go all the way round he asked

WE dont the girl replied with emphasis theres a shorter cut

Where

Thats telling she answered shortly

Whats your name asked Lance after a steep scramble and a drop into
the ravine

Flip

What

Flip

I mean your first nameyour front name

Flip

Flip Oh short for Felipa

It aint Flipperits Flip And she relapsed into silence

You dont ask me mine suggested Lance

She did not vouchsafe a reply

Then you dont want to know

Maybe Dad will You can lie to HIM

This direct answer apparently sustained the agreeable homicide for some
moments He moved onward silently exuding admiration

Only added Flip with a sudden caution youd better agree with me

The trail here turned again abruptly and reentered the canyon Lance
looked up and noticed they were almost directly beneath the bay thicket
and the plateau that towered far above them The trail here showed signs
of clearing and the way was marked by felled trees and stumps of pines

What does your father do here he finally asked Flip remained silent
swinging the revolver Lance repeated his question

Burns charcoal and makes diamonds said Flip looking at him from the
corners of her eyes

Makes diamonds echoed Lance

Flip nodded her head

Many of em he continued carelessly

Lots But theyre not big she returned with a sidelong glance

Oh theyre not big said Lance gravely

They had by this time reached a small staked inclosure whence the
sudden fluttering and cackle of poultry welcomed the return of the
evident mistress of this sylvan retreat It was scarcely imposing
Further on a cooking stove under a tree a saddle and bridle a few
household implements scattered about indicated the ranch Like most
pioneer clearings it was simply a disorganized raid upon nature that
had left behind a desolate battlefield strewn with waste and decay
The fallen trees the crushed thicket the splintered limbs the rudely
tornup soil were made hideous by their grotesque juxtaposition with
the wrecked fragments of civilization in empty cans broken bottles
battered hats soleless boots frayed stockings castoff rags and
the crowning absurdity of the twistedwire skeleton of a hooped skirt
hanging from a branch The wildest defile the densest thicket the most
virgin solitude was less dreary and forlorn than this first footprint
of man The only redeeming feature of this prolonged bivouac was the
cabin itself Built of the halfcylindrical strips of pine bark and
thatched with the same material it had a certain picturesque rusticity
But this was an accident of economy rather than taste for which
Flip apologized by saying that the bark of the pine was no good for
charcoal

I reckon Dads in the woods she added pausing before the open door
of the cabin Oh Dad Her voice clear and high seemed to fill
the whole long canyon and echoed from the green plateau above The
monotonous strokes of an axe were suddenly pretermitted and somewhere
from the depths of the closeset pines a voice answered Flip There
was a pause of a few moments with some muttering stumbling and
crackling in the underbrush and then the sudden appearance of Dad

Had Lance first met him in the thicket he would have been puzzled to
assign his race to Mongolian Indian or Ethiopian origin Perfunctory
but incomplete washings of his hands and face after charcoal burning
had gradually ground into his skin a grayish slatepencil pallor
grotesquely relieved at the edges where the washing had left off
with a border of a darker color He looked like an overworked Christy
minstrel with the briefest of intervals between his performances There
were black rims in the orbits of his eyes as if he gazed feebly out of
unglazed spectacles which heightened his simian resemblance already
grotesquely exaggerated by what appeared to be repeated and spasmodic
experiments in dyeing his gray hair Without the slightest notice of
Lance he inflicted his protesting and querulous presence entirely on
his daughter

Well whats up now Yer ye are calling me from work an hour before
noon Dog my skin ef I ever get fairly limbered up afore its Dad
and Oh Dad

To Lances intense satisfaction the girl received this harangue with
an air of supreme indifference and when Dad had relapsed into an
unintelligible and as it seemed to Lance a halffrightened muttering
she said coolly

Yed better drop that axe and scoot round getten this stranger some
breakfast and some grub to take with him Hes one of them San Francisco
sports out here trout fishing in the branch Hes got adrift from his
party has lost his rod and fixins and had to camp out last night in
the Gin and Ginger Woods

Thats just it its allers suthin like that screamed the old man
dashing his fist on his leg in a feeble impotent passion but without
looking at Lance Why in blazes dont he go up to that there blamed
hotel on the summit Why in thunder But here he caught his daughters
large freckled eyes full in his own He blinked feebly his voice fell
into a tone of whining entreaty Now look yer Flip its playing
it rather low down on the old man this yer running in o tramps and
desarted emigrants and castashore sailors and forlorn widders and
ravin lunatics on this yer ranch I put it to you Mister he said
abruptly turning to Lance for the first time but as if he had already
taken an active part in the conversationI put it as a gentleman
yourself and a fairminded sportin man if this is the square thing

Before Lance could reply Flip had already begun Thats just it Dye
reckon being a sportin man and an A 1 feller hes goin to waltz down
inter that hotel rigged out ez he is Dye reckon hes goin to let
his partners get the laugh outer him Dye reckon hes goin to show his
head outer this yer ranch till he can do it square Not much Go long
Dad youre talking silly

The old man weakened He feebly trailed his axe between his legs to a
stump and sat down wiping his forehead with his sleeve and imparting
to it the appearance of a slate with a difficult sum partly rubbed out
He looked despairingly at Lance In course he said with a deep sigh
you naturally aint got any money In course you left your pocketbook
containing fifty dollars under a stone and cant find it In course
he continued as he observed Lance put his hand to his pocket youve
only got a blank check on Wells Fargo  Co for a hundred dollars and
youd like me to give you the difference

Amused as Lance evidently was at this his absolute admiration for Flip
absorbed everything else With his eyes fixed upon the girl he briefly
assured the old man that he would pay for everything he wanted He did
this with a manner quite different from the careless easy attitude he
had assumed toward Flip at least the quickwitted girl noticed it and
wondered if he was angry It was quite true that ever since his eye had
fallen upon another of his own sex its glance had been less frank and
careless Certain traits of possible impatience which might develop
into manslaying were coming to the fore Yet a word or a gesture of
Flips was sufficient to change that manner and when with the fretful
assistance of her father she had prepared a somewhat sketchy and
primitive repast he questioned the old man about diamondmaking The
eye of Dad kindled

I want ter know how ye knew I was making diamonds he asked with a
certain bashful pettishness not unlike his daughters

Heard it in Frisco replied Lance with glib mendacity glancing at
the girl

I reckon theyre gettin sort of skeert down therethem jewelers
chuckled Dad yet its in nater that their figgers will have to come
down Its only a question of the price of charcoal I suppose they
didnt tell you how I made the discovery

Lance would have stopped the old mans narrative by saying that he
knew the story but he wished to see how far Flip lent herself to her
fathers delusion

Ye see one night about two years ago I had a pit o charcoal burning
out there and tho it had been a smouldering and a smoking and a
blazing for nigh unto a month somehow it didnt charcoal worth a cent
And yet dog my skin but the heat o that er pit was suthin hidyus
and frightful ye couldnt stand within a hundred yards of it and they
could feel it on the stage road three miles over yon tother side the
mountain There was nights when me and Flip had to take our blankets
up the ravine and camp out all night and the back of this yer hut
shriveled up like that bacon It was about as nigh on to hell as any
sample ye kin get here Now mebbe you think I built that air fire
Mebbe youll allow the heat was just the natral burning of that pit

Certainly said Lance trying to see Flips eyes which were
resolutely averted

Thets whar youd be lyin That yar heat kem out of the bowels of the
yearthkem up like out of a chimbley or a blast and kep up that yar
fire And when she cools down a month after and I got to strip her
there was a hole in the yearth and a spring o bilin scaldin water
pourin out of it ez big as your waist And right in the middle of it
was this yer He rose with the instinct of a skillful raconteur and
whisked from under his bunk a chamois leather bag which he emptied
on the table before them It contained a small fragment of native rock
crystal halffused upon a petrified bit of pine It was so glaringly
truthful so really what it purported to be that the most unscientific
woodman or pioneer would have understood it at a glance Lance raised
his mirthful eyes to Flip

It was cooled suddintstunted by the water said the girl eagerly
She stopped and as abruptly turned away her eyes and her reddened face

Thats it thats just it continued the old man Thars Flip thar
knows it she aint no fool Lance did not speak but turned a hard
unsympathizing look upon the old man and rose almost roughly The old
man clutched his coat Thats it ye see The carbons just turning to
dimens And stunted And why Cos the heat wasnt kep up long enough
Mebbe yer think I stopped thar That aint me Thars a pit out yar in
the woods ez hez been burning six months it haint in course got the
advantages o the old one for its natral heat But Im keeping that
heat up Ive got a hole where I kin watch it every four hours When
the time comes Im thar Dont you see Thats me thats David
Fairleythats the old manyou bet

Thats so said Lance curtly And now Mr Fairley if youll
hand me over a coat or a jacket till I can get past these fogs on the
Monterey road I wont keep you from your diamond pit He threw down a
handful of silver on the table

Thers a deerskin jacket yer said the old man that one o them
vaqueros left for the price of a bottle of whiskey

I reckon it wouldnt suit the stranger said Flip dubiously producing
a muchworn slashed and braided vaqueros jacket But it did suit
Lance who found it warm and also had suddenly found a certain
satisfaction in opposing Flip When he had put it on and nodded coldly
to the old man and carelessly to Flip he walked to the door

If youre going to take the Monterey road I can show you a short cut
to it said Flip with a certain kind of shy civility

The paternal Fairley groaned Thats it let the chickens and the ranch
go to thunder as long as theres a stranger to trapse round with go
on

Lance would have made some savage reply but Flip interrupted You know
yourself Dad its a blind trail and as that ere constable that kem
out here hunting French Pete couldnt find it and had to go round by
the canyon like ez not the stranger would lose his way and have to
come back This dangerous prospect silenced the old man and Flip and
Lance stepped into the road together They walked on for some moments
without speaking Suddenly Lance turned upon his companion

You didnt swallow all that rot about the diamond did you he asked
crossly

Flip ran a little ahead as if to avoid a reply

You dont mean to say thats the sort of hog wash the old man serves
out to you regularly continued Lance becoming more slangy in his ill
temper

I dont know that its any consarn o yours what I think replied
Flip hopping from boulder to boulder as they crossed the bed of a dry
watercourse

And I suppose youve piloted round and drynussed every tramp and dead
beat youve met since you came here continued Lance with unmistakable
ill humor How many have you helped over this road

Its a year since there was a Chinaman chased by some Irishmen from the
Crossing into the brush about yer and he was too afeered to come out
and nigh most starved to death in thar I had to drag him out and start
him on the mountain for you couldnt get him back to the road He was
the last one but YOU

Do you reckon its the right thing for a girl like you to run about
with trash of this kind and mix herself up with all sorts of rough and
bad company said Lance

Flip stopped short Look if youre goin to talk like Dad Ill go
back

The ridiculousness of such a resemblance struck him more keenly than a
consciousness of his own ingratitude He hastened to assure Flip that he
was joking When he had made his peace they fell into talk again Lance
becoming unselfish enough to inquire into one or two facts concerning
her life which did not immediately affect him Her mother had died on
the plains when she was a baby and her brother had run away from home
at twelve She fully expected to see him again and thought he might
sometime stray into their canyon That is why then you take so much
stock in tramps said Lance You expect to recognize HIM

Well replied Flip gravely there is suthing in THAT and theres
suthing in THIS some o these chaps might run across brother and do him
a good turn for the sake of me

Like me for instance suggested Lance

Like you Youd do him a good turn wouldnt you

You bet said Lance with a sudden emotion that quite startled him
only dont you go to throwing yourself round promiscuously He was
halfconscious of an irritating sense of jealousy as he asked if any of
her proteges had ever returned

No said Flip no one ever did It shows she added with sublime
simplicity I had done em good and they could get on alone Dont
it

It does responded Lance grimly Have you any other friends that
come

Only the Postmaster at the Crossing

The Postmaster

Yes hes reckonin to marry me next year if Im big enough

And what do you reckon asked Lance earnestly

Flip began a series of distortions with her shoulders ran on ahead
picked up a few pebbles and threw them into the wood glanced back at
Lance with swimming mottled eyes that seemed a piquant incarnation of
everything suggestive and tantalizing and said

Thats telling

They had by this time reached the spot where they were to separate
Look said Flip pointing to a faint deflection of their path which
seemed however to lose itself in the underbrush a dozen yards away
thers your trail It gets plainer and broader the further you get on
but you must use your eyes here and get to know it well afore you get
into the fog Goodby

Goodby Lance took her hand and drew her beside him She was still
redolent of the spices of the thicket and to the young mans excited
fancy seemed at that moment to personify the perfume and intoxication of
her native woods Half laughingly half earnestly he tried to kiss her
she struggled for some time strongly but at the last moment yielded
with a slight return and the exchange of a subtle fire that thrilled
him and left him standing confused and astounded as she ran away He
watched her lithe nymphlike figure disappear in the checkered shadows
of the wood and then he turned briskly down the halfhidden trail His
eyesight was keen he made good progress and was soon well on his way
toward the distant ridge

But Flips return had not been as rapid When she reached the wood she
crept to its beetling verge and looking across the canyon watched
Lances figure as it vanished and reappeared in the shadows and
sinuosities of the ascent When he reached the ridge the outlying fog
crept across the summit caught him in its embrace and wrapped him
from her gaze Flip sighed raised herself put her alternate foot on
a stump and took a long pull at her toobrief stockings When she had
pulled down her skirt and endeavored once more to renew the intimacy
that had existed in previous years between the edge of her petticoat and
the top of her stockings she sighed again and went home




CHAPTER III


For six months the sea fogs monotonously came and went along the
Monterey coast for six months they beleaguered the Coast Range with
afternoon sorties of white hosts that regularly swept over the mountain
crest and were as regularly beaten back again by the leveled lances of
the morning sun For six months that white veil which had once hidden
Lance Harriott in its folds returned without him For that amiable
outlaw no longer needed disguise or hidingplace The swift wave of
pursuit that had dashed him on the summit had fallen back and the next
day was broken and scattered Before the week had passed a regular
judicial inquiry relieved his crime of premeditation and showed it to
be a rude duel of two armed and equally desperate men From a secure
vantage in a seacoast town Lance challenged a trial by his peers and
as an already prejudged man escaping from his executioners obtained a
change of venue Regular justice seated by the calm Pacific found
the action of an interior irregular jury rash and hasty Lance was
liberated on bail

The Postmaster at Fishers Crossing had just received the weekly mail
and express from San Francisco and was engaged in examining it It
consisted of five letters and two parcels Of these three of the
letters and the two parcels were directed to Flip It was not the
first time during the last six months that this extraordinary event had
occurred and the curiosity of the Crossing was duly excited As Flip
had never called personally for the letters or parcels but had sent one
of her wild irregular scouts or henchmen to bring them and as she was
seldom seen at the Crossing or on the stage road that curiosity was
never satisfied The disappointment to the Postmastera man past the
middle agepartook of a sentimental nature He looked at the letters
and parcels he looked at his watch it was yet early he could
return by noon He again examined the addresses they were in the same
handwriting as the previous letters His mind was made up he would
deliver them himself The poetic soulful side of his mission was
delicately indicated by a pale blue necktie a clean shirt and a small
package of gingernuts of which Flip was extravagantly fond

The common road to Fairleys Ranch was by the stage turnpike to a point
below the Gin and Ginger Woods where the prudent horseman usually left
his beast and followed the intersecting trail afoot It was here that
the Postmaster suddenly observed on the edge of the wood the figure of
an elegantlydressed woman she was walking slowly and apparently at
her ease one hand held her skirts lightly gathered between her gloved
fingers the other slowly swung a riding whip Was it a picnic of some
people from Monterey or Santa Cruz The spectacle was novel enough to
justify his coming nearer Suddenly she withdrew into the wood he lost
sight of her she was gone He remembered however that Flip was
still to be seen and as the steep trail was beginning to tax all his
energies he was fain to hurry forward The sun was nearly vertical when
he turned into the canyon and saw the bark roof of the cabin beyond At
almost the same moment Flip appeared flushed and panting in the road
before him

Youve got something for me she said pointing to the parcel and
letters Completely taken by surprise the Postmaster mechanically
yielded them up and as instantly regretted it Theyre paid for
continued Flip observing his hesitation

Thats so stammered the official of the Crossing seeing his last
chance of knowing the contents of the parcel vanish but I thought ez
its a valooable package maybe ye might want to examine it to see that
it was all right afore ye receipted for it

Ill risk it said Flip coolly and if it aint right Ill let ye
know

As the girl seemed inclined to retire with her property the Postmaster
was driven to other conversation We aint had the pleasure of seeing
you down at the Crossing for a month o Sundays he began with airy
yet pronounced gallantry Some folks let on you was keepin company
with some feller like Bijah Brown and you were getting a little too
set up for the Crossing The individual here mentioned being the county
butcher and supposed to exhibit his hopeless affection for Flip by
making a long and useless divergence from his weekly route to enter the
canyon for orders Flip did not deem it necessary to reply Then I
allowed how ez you might have company he continued I reckon theres
some city folks up at the summit I saw a mighty smart fashnble gal
cavorting round Had no end o style and fancy fixins Thats my kind
I tell you I just weaken on that sort o gal he continued in the
firm belief that he had awakened Flips jealousy as he glanced at her
wellworn homespun frock and found her eyes suddenly fixed on his own

Strange I aint got to see her yet she replied coolly shouldering
her parcel and quite ignoring any sense of obligation to him for his
extraofficial act

But you might get to see her at the edge of the Gin and Ginger Woods
he persisted feebly in a last effort to detain her if youll take a
pasear there with me Flips only response was to walk on toward the
cabin whence with a vague complimentary suggestion of droppin in to
pass the time o day with her father the Postmaster meekly followed

The paternal Fairley once convinced that his daughters new companion
required no pecuniary or material assistance from his hands relaxed
to the extent of entering into a querulous confidence with him during
which Flip took the opportunity of slipping away As Fairley had that
infelicitous tendency of most weak natures to unconsciously exaggerate
unimportant details in their talk the Postmaster presently became
convinced that the butcher was a constant and assiduous suitor of
Flips The absurdity of his sending parcels and letters by post when he
might bring them himself did not strike the official On the contrary
he believed it to be a master stroke of cunning Fired by jealousy and
Flips indifference he deemed it his dutyusing that facile form of
cowardly offensivenessto betray Flip

Of which she was happily oblivious Once away from the cabin she
plunged into the woods with the parcel swung behind her like a
knapsack Leaving the trail she presently struck off in a straight line
through cover and underbrush with the unerring instinct of an animal
climbing hand over hand the steepest ascent or fluttering like a bird
from branch to branch down the deepest declivity She soon reached
that part of the trail where the susceptible Postmaster had seen the
fascinating unknown Assuring herself she was not followed she crept
through the thicket until she reached a little waterfall and basin that
had served the fugitive Lance for a bath The spot bore signs of later
and more frequent occupancy and when Flip carefully removed some bark
and brushwood from a cavity in the rock and drew forth various folded
garments it was evident she had used it as a sylvan dressingroom Here
she opened the parcel it contained a small and delicate shawl of yellow
China crepe Flip instantly threw it over her shoulders and stepped
hurriedly toward the edge of the wood Then she began to pass backward
and forward before the trunk of a tree At first nothing was visible on
the tree but a closer inspection showed a large pane of ordinary window
glass stuck in the fork of the branches It was placed at such a cunning
angle against the darkness of the forest opening that it made a soft and
mysterious mirror not unlike a Claude Lorraine glass wherein not only
the passing figure of the young girl was seen but the dazzling green
and gold of the hillside and the faroff silhouetted crests of the
Coast Range

But this was evidently only a prelude to a severer rehearsal When she
returned to the waterfall she unearthed from her stores a large piece
of yellow soap and some yards of rough cotton sheeting These she
deposited beside the basin and again crept to the edge of the wood to
assure herself that she was alone Satisfied that no intruding foot
had invaded that virgin bower she returned to her bath and began
to undress A slight wind followed her and seemed to whisper to the
circumjacent trees It appeared to waken her sister naiads and nymphs
who joining their leafy fingers softly drew around her a gently moving
band of trembling lights and shadows of flecked sprays and inextricably
mingled branches and involved her in a chaste sylvan obscurity veiled
alike from pursuing god or stumbling shepherd Within these hallowed
precincts was the musical ripple of laughter and falling water and at
times the glimpse of a lithe briercaught limb or a ray of sunlight
trembling over bright flanks or the white austere outline of a childish
bosom

When she drew again the leafy curtain and once more stepped out of
the wood she was completely transformed It was the figure that had
appeared to the Postmaster the slight erect graceful form of a
young woman modishly attired It was Flip but Flip made taller by the
lengthened skirt and clinging habiliments of fashion Flip freckled
but through the cunning of a relief of yellow color in her gown her
piquant brownshot face and eyes brightened and intensified until she
seemed like a spicy odor made visible I cannot affirm that the judgment
of Flips mysterious modiste was infallible or that the taste of
Mr Lance Harriott her patron was fastidious enough that it was
picturesque and perhaps not more glaring and extravagant than the color
in which Spring herself had once clothed the sere hillside where Flip
was now seated The phantom mirror in the tree fork caught and held her
with the sky the green leaves the sunlight and all the graciousness
of her surroundings and the wind gently tossed her hair and the gay
ribbons of her gypsy hat Suddenly she started Some remote sound in
the trail below inaudible to any ear less fine than hers arrested her
breathing She rose swiftly and darted into cover

Ten minutes passed The sun was declining the white fog was beginning
to creep over the Coast Range From the edge of the wood Cinderella
appeared disenchanted and in her homespun garments The clock had
struckthe spell was past As she disappeared down the trail even
the magic mirror moved by the wind slipped from the tree top to the
ground and became a piece of common glass




CHAPTER IV


The events of the day had produced a remarkable impression on the facial
aspect of the charcoalburning Fairley Extraordinary processes of
thought indicated by repeated rubbing of his forehead had produced a
high light in the middle and a corresponding deepening of shadow at the
sides until it bore the appearance of a perfect sphere It was this
forehead that confronted Flip reproachfully as became a deceived
comrade menacingly as became an outraged parent in the presence of a
third party anda Postmaster

Fine doins this yer receivin clandecent bundles and letters eh
he began Flip sent one swift withering look of contempt at the
Postmaster who at once becoming invertebrate and groveling mumbled
that he must get on to the Crossing and rose to go But the old
man who had counted on his presence for moral support and was clearly
beginning to hate him for precipitating this scene with his daughter
whom he feared violently protested

Sit down cant ye Dont you see youre a witness he screamed
hysterically

It was a fatal suggestion Witness repeated Flip scornfully

Yes a witness He gave ye letters and bundles

Werent they directed to me asked Flip

Yes said the Postmaster hesitatingly in course yes

Do YOU lay claim to them she said turning to her father

No responded the old man

Do you sharply to the Postmaster

No he replied

Then said Flip coolly if youre not claimin em for yourself and
you hear father say they aint his I reckon the less you have to say
about em the better

Thars suthin in that said the old man shamelessly abandoning the
Postmaster

Then why dont she say who sent em and what they are like said the
Postmaster if theres nothin in it

Yes echoed Dad Flip why dont you

Without answering the direct question Flip turned upon her father

Maybe you forget how you used to row and tear round here because tramps
and such like came to the ranch for suthin and I gave it to em Maybe
youll quit tearin round and letting yourself be made a fool of now
by that man just because one of those tramps gets up and sends us some
presents back in turn

Twasnt me Flip said the old man deprecatingly but glaring at the
astonished Postmaster Twasnt my doin I allus said if you cast your
bread on the waters it would come back to you by return mail The fact
is the Govment is gettin too highhanded Some o these bloated
officials had better climb down before next leckshen

Maybe continued Flip to her father without looking at her
discomfited visitor yed better find out whether one of those
officials comes up to this yer ranch to steal away a gal about my own
size or to get points about diamondmaking I reckon he dont travel
round to find out who writes all the letters that go through the Post
Office

The Postmaster had seemingly miscalculated the old mans infirm temper
and the daughters skillful use of it He was unprepared for Flips
boldness and audacity and when he saw that both barrels of the
accusation had taken effect on the charcoal burner who was rising
with epileptic rage he fairly turned and fled The old man would have
followed him with objurgation beyond the door but for the restraining
hand of Flip

Baffled and beaten nevertheless Fate was not wholly unkind to the
retreating suitor Near the Gin and Ginger Woods he picked up a letter
which had fallen from Flips pocket He recognized the writing and did
not scruple to read it It was not a love epistleat least not such a
one as he would have writtenit did not give the address nor the name
of the correspondent but he read the following with greedy eyes


Perhaps its just as well that you dont rig yourself out for the
benefit of those dead beats at the Crossing or any tramp that might
hang round the ranch Keep all your style for me when I come I cant
tell you when its mighty uncertain before the rainy season But
Im coming soon Dont go back on your promise about lettin up on the
tramps and being a little more hightoned And dont you give em so
much Its true I sent you hats TWICE I clean forgot all about the
first but I wouldnt have given a tendollar hat to a nigger woman
who had a sick baby because I had an extra hat Id have let that baby
slide I forgot to ask whether the skirt is worn separately I must see
the dressmaking sharp about it but I think youll want something on
besides a jacket and skirt at least it looks like it up here I dont
think you could manage a piano down there without the old man knowing
it and raisin the devil generally I promised you Id let up on him
Mind you keep all your promises to me Im glad youre gettin on with
the sixshooter tin cans are good at fifteen yards but try it on
suthin that MOVES I forgot to say that I am on the track of your
big brother Its a three years old track and he was in Arizona The
friend who told me didnt expatiate much on what he did there but I
reckon they had a high old time If hes above the earth Ill find him
you bet The yerba buena and the southern wood came all rightthey
smelt like you Say Flip do you remember the lastthe VERY
lastthing that happened when you said Goodby on the trail Dont
let me ever find out that youve let anybody else kiss


But here the virtuous indignation of the Postmaster found vent in an
oath He threw the letter away He retained of it only two factsFlip
HAD a brother who was missing she had a lover present in the flesh

How much of the substance of this and previous letters Flip had confided
to her father I cannot say If she suppressed anything it was probably
that which affected Lances secret alone and it was doubtful how much
of that she herself knew In her own affairs she was frank without being
communicative and never lost her shy obstinacy even with her father
Governing the old man as completely as she did she appeared most
embarrassed when she was most dominant she had her own way without
lifting her voice or her eyes she seemed oppressed by mauvaise honte
when she was most triumphant she would end a discussion with a shy
murmur addressed to herself or a single gesture of selfconsciousness

The disclosure of her strange relations with an unknown man and the
exchange of presents and confidences seemed to suddenly awake Fairley to
a vague uneasy sense of some unfulfilled duties as a parent The first
effect of this on his weak nature was a peevish antagonism to the cause
of it He had long fretful monologues on the vanity of diamondmaking
if accompanied with a pestering by interlopers on the wickedness
of concealment and conspiracy and their effects on charcoalburning
on the nurturing of spies and adders in the family circle and on the
seditiousness of dark and mysterious councils in which a grayhaired
father was left out It was true that a word or look from Flip generally
brought these monologues to an inglorious and abrupt termination but
they were none the less lugubrious as long as they lasted In time
they were succeeded by an affectation of contrite apology and
selfdepreciation Dont go out o the way to ask the old man he
would say referring to the quantity of bacon to be ordered its
natral a young gal should have her own advisers The state of the
flour barrel would also produce a like selfabasement Unless yere
already in correspondence about more flour ye might take the opinion o
the first tramp ye meet ez to whether Santa Cruz Mills is a good
brand but dont ask the old man If Flip was in conversation with
the butcher Fairley would obtrusively retire with the hope he wasnt
intrudin on their secrets

These phases of her fathers weakness were not frequent enough to excite
her alarm but she could not help noticing they were accompanied with a
seriousness unusual to him He began to be tremulously watchful of her
returning often from work at an earlier hour and lingering by the cabin
in the morning He brought absurd and useless presents for her and
presented them with a nervous anxiety poorly concealed by an assumption
of careless paternal generosity Suthin I picked up at the Crossin
for ye today he would say airily and retire to watch the effect of
a pair of shoes two sizes too large or a fur cap in September He
would have hired a cheap parlor organ for her but for the apparently
unexpected revelation that she couldnt play He had received the news
of a clue to his longlost son without emotion but lately he seemed to
look upon it as a foregone conclusion and one that necessarily solved
the question of companionship for Flip In course when youve got your
own flesh and blood with ye ye cant go foolin around with strangers
These autumnal blossoms of affection I fear came too late for any
effect upon Flip precociously matured by her fathers indifference
and selfishness But she was good humored and seeing him seriously
concerned gave him more of her time even visited him in the sacred
seclusion of the diamond pit and listened with faroff eyes to his
fitful indictment of all things outside his grimy laboratory Much
of this patient indifference came with a capricious change in her own
habits she no longer indulged in the rehearsal of dress she packed
away her most treasured garments and her leafy boudoir knew her no
more She sometimes walked on the hillside and often followed the trail
she had taken with Lance when she led him to the ranch She once or
twice extended her walk to the spot where she had parted from him
and as often came shyly away her eyes downcast and her face warm with
color Perhaps because these experiences and some mysterious instinct of
maturing womanhood had left a story in her eyes which her two adorers
the Postmaster and the Butcher read with passion she became famous
without knowing it Extravagant stories of her fascinations brought
strangers into the valley The effect upon her father may be imagined
Lance could not have desired a more effective guardian than he proved to
be in this emergency Those who had been told of this hidden pearl were
surprised to find it so jealously protected




CHAPTER V


The long parched summer had drawn to its dusty close Much of it was
already blown abroad and dissipated on trail and turnpike or crackled
in harsh unelastic fibres on hillside and meadow Some of it had
disappeared in the palpable smoke by day and fiery crests by night of
burning forests The besieging fogs on the Coast Range daily thinned
their hosts and at last vanished The wind changed from northwest to
southwest The salt breath of the sea was on the summit And then
one day the staring unchanged sky was faintly touched with remote
mysterious clouds and grew tremulous in expression The next morning
dawned upon a newer face in the heavens on changed woods on altered
outlines on vanished crests on forgotten distances It was raining

Four weeks of this change with broken spaces of sunlight and intense
blue aerial islands and then a storm set in All day the summit pines
and redwoods rocked in the blast At times the onset of the rain seemed
to be held back by the fury of the gale or was visibly seen in sharp
waves on the hillside Unknown and concealed watercourses suddenly
overflowed the trails pools became lakes and brooks rivers Hidden from
the storm the sylvan silence of sheltered valleys was broken by the
impetuous rush of waters even the tiny streamlet that traversed Flips
retreat in the Gin and Ginger Woods became a cascade

The storm drove Fairley from his couch early The falling of a large
tree across the trail and the sudden overflow of a small stream beside
it hastened his steps But he was doomed to encounter what was to him a
more disagreeable objecta human figure By the bedraggled drapery that
flapped and fluttered in the wind by the long unkempt hair that hid
the face and eyes and by the grotesquely misplaced bonnet the old man
recognized one of his old trespassersan Indian squaw

Clear out er that Come make tracks will ye the old man screamed
but here the wind stopped his voice and drove him against a hazel bush

Me heap sick answered the squaw shivering through her muddy shawl

Ill make ye a heap sicker if ye dont vamose the ranch continued
Fairley advancing

Me wantee Wangee girl Wangee girl give me heap grub said the squaw
without moving

You bet your life groaned the old man to himself Nevertheless
an idea struck him Ye aint brought no presents hev ye he asked
cautiously Ye aint got no pooty things for poor Wangee girl he
continued insinuatingly

Me got heap cache nuts and berries said the squaw

Oh in course in course Thats just it screamed Fairley youve
got em cached only two mile from yer and youll go and get em for a
half dollar cash down

Me bring Wangee girl to cache replied the Indian pointing to the
wood Honest Injin

Another bright idea struck Mr Fairley But it required some
elaboration Hurrying the squaw with him through the pelting rain he
reached the shelter of the corral Vainly the shivering aborigine drew
her tightly bandaged papoose closer to her square flat breast and
looked longingly toward the cabin the old man backed her against the
palisade Here he cautiously imparted his dark intentions to employ her
to keep watch and ward over the ranch and especially over its young
mistressclear out all the tramps ceptin yourself and Ill keep
ye in grub and rum Many and deliberate repetitions of this offer in
various forms at last seemed to affect the squaw she nodded violently
and echoed the last word rum Now she added The old man hesitated
she was in possession of his secret he groaned and promising an
immediate installment of liquor led her to the cabin

The door was so securely fastened against the impact of the storm that
some moments elapsed before the bar was drawn and the old man had
become impatient and profane When it was partly opened by Flip he
hastily slipped in dragging the squaw after him and cast one
single suspicious glance around the rude apartment which served as a
sittingroom Flip had apparently been writing A small inkstand was
still on the board table but her paper had evidently been concealed
before she allowed them to enter The squaw instantly squatted before
the adobe hearth warmed her bundled baby and left the ceremony
of introduction to her companion Flip regarded the two with calm
preoccupation and indifference The only thing that touched her interest
was the old squaws draggled skirt and limp neckerchief They were
Flips own long since abandoned and cast off in the Gin and Ginger
Woods Secrets again whined Fairley still eying Flip furtively
Secrets again in coursein coursejiss so Secrets that must be kep
from the ole man Dark doins by ones own flesh and blood Go on go
on Dont mind me Flip did not reply She had even lost the interest
in her old dress Perhaps it had only touched some note in unison with
her revery

Cant ye get the poor critter some whiskey he queried fretfully Ye
used to be peart enuff before As Flip turned to the corner to lift
the demijohn Fairley took occasion to kick the squaw with his foot and
indicate by extravagant pantomime that the bargain was not to be alluded
to before the girl Flip poured out some whiskey in a tin cup and
approaching the squaw handed it to her Its like ez not continued
Fairley to his daughter but looking at the squaw that shell be
huntin the woods off and on and kinder looking after the last pit near
the Madronos yell give her grub and licker ez she likes Well dye
hear Flip Are ye moonin agin with yer secrets Whats gone with ye

If the child were dreaming it was a delicious dream Her magnetic eyes
were suffused by a strange light as though the eye itself had blushed
her full pulse showed itself more in the rounding outline of her cheek
than in any deepening of color indeed if there was any heightening of
tint it was in her freckles which fairly glistened like tiny spangles
Her eyes were downcast her shoulders slightly bent but her voice was
low and clear and thoughtful as ever

One o the big pines above the Madrono pit has blown over into the
run she said Its choked up the water and its risin fast Like ez
not its pourin over into the pit by this time

The old man rose with a fretful cry And why in blames didnt you say
so first he screamed catching up his axe and rushing to the door

Ye didnt give me a chance said Flip raising her eyes for the first
time With an impatient imprecation Fairley darted by her and rushed
into the wood In an instant she had shut the door and bolted it In
the same instant the squaw arose dashed the long hair not only from her
eyes but from her head tore away her shawl and blanket and revealed
the square shoulders of Lance Harriott Flip remained leaning against
the door but the young man in rising dropped the bandaged papoose
which rolled from his lap into the fire Flip with a cry sprang toward
it but Lance caught her by the waist with one arm as with the other he
dragged the bundle from the flames

Dont be alarmed he said gayly its only

What said Flip trying to disengage herself

My coat and trousers

Flip laughed which encouraged Lance to another attempt to kiss her She
evaded it by diving her head into his waistcoat and saying Theres
father

But hes gone to clear away that tree suggested Lance

One of Flips significant silences followed

Oh I see he laughed That was a plan to get him away Ah She had
released herself

Why did you come like that she said pointing to his wig and blanket

To see if youd know me he responded

No said Flip dropping her eyes Its to keep other people from
knowing you Youre hidin agin

I am returned Lance but he interrupted its only the same old
thing

But you wrote from Monterey that it was all over she persisted

So it would have been he said gloomily but for some dog down here
who is hunting up an old scent Ill spot him yet and He stopped
suddenly with such utter abstraction of hatred in his fixed and
glittering eyes that she almost feared him She laid her hand quite
unconsciously on his arm He grasped it his face changed

I couldnt wait any longer to see you Flip so I came here anyway
he went on I thought to hang round and get a chance to speak to you
first when I fell afoul of the old man He didnt know me and tumbled
right in my little game Why do you believe he wants to hire me for my
grub and liquor to act as a sort of sentry over you and the ranch
And here he related with great gusto the substance of his interview I
reckon as hes that suspicious he concluded Id better play it out
now as Ive begun only its mighty hard I cant see you here before the
fire in your fancy toggery Flip but must dodge in and out of the wet
underbrush in these yer duds of yours that I picked up in the old place
in the Gin and Ginger Woods

Then you came here just to see me asked Flip

I did

For only that

Only that

Flip dropped her eyes Lance had got his other arm around her waist but
her resisting little hand was still potent

Listen she said at last without looking up but apparently talking to
the intruding arm when Dad comes Ill get him to send you to watch the
diamond pit It isnt far its warm and

What

Ill come after a bit and see you Quit foolin now If youd only
have come here like yourselflikelikea white man

The old man interrupted Lance would have just passed me on to the
summit I couldnt have played the lost fisherman on him at this time of
year

Ye could have been stopped at the Crossing by high water you silly
said the girl It was This grammatical obscurity referred to the
stage coach

Yes but I might have been tracked to this cabin And look here Flip
he said suddenly straightening himself and lifting the girls face to
a level with his own I dont want you to lie any more for me It aint
right

All right Ye neednt go to the pit then and I wont come

Flip

And heres Dad coming Quick

Lance chose to put his own interpretation on this last adjuration The
resisting little hand was now lying quite limp on his shoulder He drew
her brown bright face near his own felt her spiced breath on his lips
his cheeks his hot eyelids his swimming eyes kissed her hurriedly
replaced his wig and blanket and dropped beside the fire with the
tremulous laugh of youth and innocent first passion Flip had withdrawn
to the window and was looking out upon the rocking pines

He dont seem to be coming said Lance with a halfshy laugh

No responded Flip demurely pressing her hot oval cheek against the
wet panes I reckon I was mistaken Youre sure she added looking
resolutely another way but still trembling like a magnetic needle
toward Lance as he moved slightly before the fire youre SURE youd
like me to come to you

Sure Flip

Hush said Flip as this reassuring query of reproachful astonishment
appeared about to be emphasized by a forward amatory dash of Lances
hush hes coming this time sure

It was indeed Fairley exceedingly wet exceedingly bedraggled
exceedingly sponged out as to color and exceedingly profane It
appeared that there was indeed a tree that had fallen in the
run but that far from diverting the overflow into the pit it had
established back water which had forced another outlet All this
might have been detected at once by any human intellect not distracted
by correspondence with strangers and enfeebled by habitually scorning
the intellect of its own progenitor This reckless selfishness had
further only resulted in giving rheumatics to that progenitor who now
required the external administration of opodeldoc to his limbs and the
internal administration of whiskey Having thus spoken Mr Fairley
with great promptitude and infantine simplicity at once bared two legs
of entirely different colors and mutely waited for his daughter to
rub them If Flip did this all unconsciously and with the mechanical
dexterity of previous habit it was because she did not quite understand
the savage eyes and impatient gestures of Lance in his encompassing wig
and blanket and because it helped her to voice her thought

Yell never be able to take yer watch at the diamond pit tonight
Dad she said and Ive been recknin you might set the squaw there
instead I can show her what to do

But to Flips momentary discomfiture her father promptly objected
Mebbee Ive got suthin else for her to do Mebbee I may have my
secrets tooeh he said with dark significance at the same time
administering a significant nudge to Lance which kept up the young
mans exasperation No shell rest yer a bit just now Ill set her to
watchin suthin else like as not when I want her Flip fell into one
of her suggestive silences Lance watched her earnestly mollified by a
single furtive glance from her significant eyes the rain dashed against
the windows and occasionally spattered and hissed in the hearth of the
broad chimney and Mr David Fairley somewhat assuaged by the
internal administration of whiskey grew more loquacious The genius of
incongruity and inconsistency which generally ruled his conduct came
out with freshened vigor under the gentle stimulation of spirit On an
evening like this he began comfortably settling himself on the floor
beside the chimney ye might rig yerself out in them new duds and fancy
fixins that that Sacramento shrimp sent ye and let your own flesh and
blood see ye If thats too much to do for your old dad ye might do it
to please that digger squaw as a Christian act Whether in the hidden
depths of the old mans consciousness there was a feeling of paternal
vanity in showing this wretched aborigine the value and importance
of the treasure she was about to guard I cannot say Flip darted an
interrogatory look at Lance who nodded a quiet assent and she flew
into the inner room She did not linger on the details of her toilet
but reappeared almost the next moment in her new finery buttoning the
neck of her gown as she entered the room and chastely stopping at the
window to characteristically pull up her stocking The peculiarity of
her situation increased her usual shyness she played with the black and
gold beads of a handsome necklaceLances last giftas the merest
child might her unbuckled shoe gave the squaw a natural opportunity of
showing her admiration and devotion by insisting upon buckling it and
gave Lance under that disguise an opportunity of covertly kissing
the little foot and ankle in the shadow of the chimney an event which
provoked slight hysterical symptoms in Flip and caused her to sit
suddenly down in spite of the remonstrances of her parent Ef you cant
quit gigglin and squirmin like an Injin baby yourself yed better git
rid o them duds he ejaculated with peevish scorn

Yet under this perfunctory rebuke his weak vanity could not be hidden
and he enjoyed the evident admiration of a creature whom he believed to
be halfwitted and degraded all the more keenly because it did not make
him jealous She could not take Flip from him Rendered garrulous by
liquor he went to voice his contempt for those who might attempt
it Taking advantage of his daughters absence to resume her homely
garments he whispered confidentially to Lance

Ye see these yer fine dresses ye might think is presents Praps
Flip lets on they are Praps she dont know any better But they aint
presents Theyre only samples o dressmaking and jewelry that a vain
conceited shrimp of a feller up in Sacramento sends down here to get
customers for In course Im to pay for em In course he reckons Im
to do it In course I calkilate to do it but he neednt try to play em
off as presents He talks suthin o coming down here sportin hisself
off on Flip as a fancy buck Not ez long ez the old mans here you
bet Thoroughly carried away by his fancied wrongs it was perhaps
fortunate that he did not observe the flashing eyes of Lance behind his
lank and lustreless wig but seeing only the figure of Lance as he had
conjured him he went on Thats why I want you to hang around her
Hang around her ontil my boyhim thats comin home on a visitgets
here and I reckon hell clear out that yar Sacramento counterjumper
Only let me get a sight o him afore Flip does eh Dye hear Dog my
skin if I dont believe the dd Injins drunk It was fortunate that
at that moment Flip reappeared and dropping on the hearth between her
father and the infuriated Lance let her hand slip in his with a warning
pressure The light touch momentarily recalled him to himself and her
but not until the quickwitted girl had had revealed to her in one
startled wave of consciousness the full extent of Lances infirmity
of temper With the instinct of awakened tenderness came a sense of
responsibility and a vague premonition of danger The coy blossom
of her heart was scarce unfolded before it was chilled by approaching
shadows Fearful of she knew not what she hesitated Every moment of
Lances stay was imperiled by a single word that might spring from
his suppressed white lips beyond and above the suspicions his sudden
withdrawal might awaken in her fathers breast she was dimly conscious
of some mysterious terror without that awaited him She listened to the
furious onslaught of the wind upon the sycamores beside their cabin and
thought she heard it there she listened to the sharp fusillade of rain
upon roof and pane and the turbulent roar and rush of leaping mountain
torrents at their very feet and fancied it was there She suddenly
sprang to the window and pressing her eyes to the pane saw
through the misty turmoil of tossing boughs and swaying branches the
scintillating intermittent flames of torches moving on the trail above
and KNEW it was there

In an instant she was collected and calm Dad she said in her
ordinary indifferent tone theres torches movin up toward the diamond
pit Likely its tramps Ill take the squaw and see And before the
old man could stagger to his feet she had dragged Lance with her into
the road




CHAPTER VI


The wind charged down upon them slamming the door at their backs
extinguishing the broad shaft of light that had momentarily shot out
into the darkness and swept them a dozen yards away Gaining the lee of
a madrono tree Lance opened his blanketed arms enfolded the girl and
felt her for one brief moment tremble and nestle in his bosom like some
frightened animal Well he said gayly what next Flip recovered
herself Youre safe now anywhere outside the house But did you expect
them tonight Lance shrugged his shoulders Why not Hush returned
the girl theyre coming this way

The four flickering scattered lights presently dropped into line The
trail had been found they were coming nearer Flip breathed quickly
the spiced aroma of her presence filled the blanket as he drew her
tightly beside him He had forgotten the storm that raged around them
the mysterious foe that was approaching until Flip caught his sleeve
with a slight laugh Why its Kennedy and Bijah

Whos Kennedy and Bijah asked Lance curtly

Kennedys the Postmaster and Bijahs the Butcher

What do they want continued Lance

Me said Flip coyly

You

Yes lets run away

Half leading half dragging her friend Flip made her way with unerring
woodcraft down the ravine The sound of voices and even the tumult of
the storm became fainter an acrid smell of burning green wood smarted
Lances lips and eyes in the midst of the darkness beneath him
gradually a faint gigantic nimbus like a lurid eye glowed and sank
quivered and faded with the spent breath of the gale as it penetrated
their retreat The pit whispered Flip its safe on the other side
she added cautiously skirting the orbit of the great eye and leading
him to a sheltered nest of bark and sawdust It was warm and odorous
Nevertheless they both deemed it necessary to enwrap themselves in the
single blanket The eye beamed fitfully upon them occasionally a wave
of lambent tremulousness passed across it its weirdness was an excuse
for their drawing nearer each other in playful terror

Flip

Well

What did the other two want To see you TOO

Likely said Flip without the least trace of coquetry Theres been
a lot of strangers yer off and on

Perhaps youd like to go back and see them

Do you want me to

Lances reply was a kiss Nevertheless he was vaguely uneasy Looks a
little as if I were running away dont it he suggested

No said Flip they think youre only a squaw its me theyre
after Lance smarted a little at this infelicitous speech A strange
and irritating sensation had been creeping over himit was his first
experience of shame and remorse I reckon Ill go back and see he
said rising abruptly

Flip was silent She was thinking Believing that the men were seeking
her only she knew that their attention would be directed from her
companion when it was found out he was no longer with her and she
dreaded to meet them in his irritable presence

Go she said tell Dad somethings gone wrong in the diamond pit and
say Im watching it for him here

And you

Ill go there and wait for him If he cant get rid of them and they
follow him there Ill come back here and meet you Anyhow Ill manage
to have Dad wait there a spell

She took his hand and led him back by a different path to the trail He
was surprised to find that the cabin its window glowing from the fire
was only a hundred yards away Go in the back way by the shed Dont
go in the room nor near the light if you can Dont talk inside
but call or beckon to Dad Remember she said with a laugh youre
keeping watch of me for him Pull your hair down on your eyes so This
operation like most feminine embellishments of the masculine toilet was
attended by a kiss and Flip stepping back into the shadow vanished in
the storm

Lances first movements were inconsistent with his assumed sex He
picked up his draggled skirt and drew a bowie knife from his boot From
his bosom he took a revolver turning the chambers noiselessly as he
felt the caps He then crept toward the cabin softly and gained the
shed It was quite dark but for a pencil of light piercing a crack of
the rude illfitting door that opened on the sittingroom A single
voice not unfamiliar to him raised in halfbrutal triumph greeted his
ears

A name was mentionedhis own His angry hand was on the latch One
moment more and he would have burst the door but in that instant
another name was uttereda name that dropped his hand from the latch
and the blood from his cheeks He staggered backward passed his hand
swiftly across his forehead recovered himself with a gesture of mingled
rage and despair and sinking on his knees beside the door pressed his
hot temples against the crack

Do I know Lance Harriott said the voice Do I know the dd
ruffian Didnt I hunt him a year ago into the brush three miles from
the Crossing Didnt we lose sight of him the very day he turned up yer
at this ranch and got smuggled over into Monterey Aint it the same
man as killed Arkansaw BobBob Ridleythe name he went by in Sonora
And who was Bob Ridley eh Who Why you dd old fool it was Bob
FairleyYOUR SON

The old mans voice rose querulous and indistinct

What are ye talkin about interrupted the first speaker I tell you
I KNOW Look at these pictures I found em on his body Look at em
Pictures of you and your girl Praps youll deny them Praps youll
tell me I lie when I tell you HE told me he was your son told me how he
ran away from you how you were livin somewhere in the mountains
makin gold or suthin else outer charcoal He told me who he was as
a secret He never let on he told it to any one else And when I found
that the man who killed him Lance Harriott had been hidin here had
been sendin spies all around to find out all about your son had been
foolin you and tryin to ruin your gal as he had killed your boy I
knew that HE knew it too

LIAR

The door fell in with a crash There was the sudden apparition of a
demoniac face still half hidden by the long trailing black locks of
hair that curled like Medusas around it A cry of terror filled the
room Three of the men dashed from the door and fled precipitately The
man who had spoken sprang toward his rifle in the chimney corner
But the movement was his last a blinding flash and shattering report
interposed between him and his weapon

The impulse carried him forward headlong into the fire that hissed and
spluttered with his blood and Lance Harriott with his smoking pistol
strode past him to the door Already far down the trail there were
hurried voices the crack and crackling of impending branches growing
fainter and fainter in the distance Lance turned back to the solitary
living figurethe old man

Yet he might have been dead too he sat so rigid and motionless his
fixed eyes staring vacantly at the body on the hearth Before him on the
table lay the cheap photographs one evidently of himself taken in some
remote epoch of complexion one of a child which Lance recognized as
Flip

Tell me said Lance hoarsely laying his quivering hand on the table
was Bob Ridley your son

My son echoed the old man in a strange faroff voice without
turning his eyes from the corpseMy sonisisis there pointing
to the dead man Hush Didnt he tell you so Didnt you hear him say
it Deaddeadshotshot

Silence are you crazy man repeated Lance tremblingly that is not
Bob Ridley but a dog a coward a liar gone to his reckoning Hear
me If your son WAS Bob Ridley I swear to God I never knew it now
ororTHEN Do you hear me Tell me Do you believe me Speak You
shall speak

He laid his hand almost menacingly on the old mans shoulder Fairley
slowly raised his head Lance fell back with a groan of horror The weak
lips were wreathed with a feeble imploring smile but the eyes wherein
the fretful peevish suspicious spirit had dwelt were blank and
tenantless the flickering intellect that had lit them was blown out and
vanished

Lance walked toward the door and remained motionless for a moment
gazing into the night When he turned back again toward the fire his
face was as colorless as the dead mans on the hearth the fire of
passion was gone from his beaten eyes his step was hesitating and slow
He went up to the table

I say old man he said with a strange smile and an odd premature
suggestion of the infinite weariness of death in his voice you
wouldnt mind giving me this would you and he took up the picture of
Flip The old man nodded repeatedly Thank you said Lance He went
to the door paused a moment and returned Goodby old man he
said holding out his hand Fairley took it with a childish smile Hes
dead said the old man softly holding Lances hand but pointing to
the hearth Yes said Lance with the faintest of smiles on the palest
of faces You feel sorry for any one thats dead dont you Fairley
nodded again Lance looked at him with eyes as remote as his own shook
his head and turned away When he reached the door he laid his revolver
carefully and indeed somewhat ostentatiously upon a chair But when
he stepped from the threshold he stopped a moment in the light of the
open door to examine the lock of a small derringer which he drew from
his pocket He then shut the door carefully and with the same slow
hesitating step felt his way into the night

He had but one idea in his mind to find some lonely spot some spot
where the footsteps of man would never penetrate some spot that would
yield him rest sleep obliteration forgetfulness and above all
where HE would be forgotten He had seen such places surely there were
manywhere bones were picked up of dead men who had faded from the
earth and had left no other record If he could only keep his senses now
he might find such a spot but he must be careful for her little feet
went everywhere and she must never see him again alive or dead And in
the midst of his thoughts and the darkness and the storm he heard a
voice at his side Lance how long you have been



Left to himself the old man again fell into a vacant contemplation
of the dead body before him until a stronger blast swept down like an
avalanche upon the cabin burst through the illfastened door and broken
chimney and dashing the ashes and living embers over the floor filled
the room with blinding smoke and flame Fairley rose with a feeble cry
and then as if acted upon by some dominant memory groped under the
bed until he found his buckskin bag and his precious crystal and
fled precipitately from the room Lifted by this second shock from his
apathy he returned to the fixed idea of his lifethe discovery and
creation of the diamondand forgot all else The feeble grasp that his
shaken intellect kept of the events of the night relaxed the disguised
Lance the story of his son the murder slipped into nothingness there
remained only the one idea his nightly watch by the diamond pit The
instinct of long habit was stronger than the darkness or the onset of
the storm and he kept his tottering way over stream and fallen timber
until he reached the spot A sudden tremor seemed to shake the lambent
flame that had lured him on He thought he heard the sound of voices
there were signs of recent disturbancefootprints in the sawdust With
a cry of rage and suspicion Fairley slipped into the pit and sprang
toward the nearest opening To his frenzied fancy it had been tampered
with his secret discovered the fruit of his long labors stolen from
him that very night With superhuman strength he began to open the pit
scattering the halfcharred logs right and left and giving vent to the
suffocating gases that rose from the now incandescent charcoal At times
the fury of the gale would drive it back and hold it against the sides
of the pit leaving the opening free at times following the blind
instinct of habit the demented man would fall upon his face and bury
his nose and mouth in the wet bark and sawdust At last the paroxysm
past he sank back again in his old apathetic attitude of watching
the attitude he had so often kept beside his sylvan crucible In this
attitude and in silence he waited for the dawn

It came with a hush in the storm it came with blue openings in the
broken up and tumbled heavens it came with stars that glistened first
and then paled and at last sank drowning in those deep cerulean lakes
it came with those cerulean lakes broadening into vaster seas whose
shores expanded at last into one illimitable ocean cerulean no more
but flecked with crimson and opal dyes it came with the lightly lifted
misty curtain of the day torn and rent on crag and pine top but always
lifting lifting It came with the sparkle of emerald in the grasses
and the flash of diamonds in every spray with a whisper in the
awakening woods and voices in the traveled roads and trails

The sound of these voices stopped before the pit and seemed to
interrogate the old man He came and putting his finger on his lips
made a sign of caution When three or four men had descended he bade
them follow him saying weakly and disjointedly but persistently My
boymy son Robertcame homecame home at lasthere with Flipboth
of themcome and see

He had reached a little niche or nest in the hillside and stopped and
suddenly drew aside a blanket Beneath it side by side lay Flip and
Lance dead with their cold hands clasped in each others

Suffocated said two or three turning with horror toward the broken
up and still smouldering pit

Asleep said the old man Asleep Ive seen em lying that way when
they were babies together Dont tell me Dont say I dont know my
own flesh and blood So so So my pretty ones He stooped and kissed
them Then drawing the blanket over them gently he rose and said
softly Good night
