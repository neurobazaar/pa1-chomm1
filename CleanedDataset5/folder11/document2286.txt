DEVILS FORD




CHAPTER I


It was a season of unequalled prosperity in Devils Ford The half a
dozen cabins scattered along the banks of the North Fork as if by some
overflow of that capricious river had become augmented during a week of
fierce excitement by twenty or thirty others that were huddled together
on the narrow gorge of Devils Spur or cast up on its steep sides So
sudden and violent had been the change of fortune that the dwellers
in the older cabins had not had time to change with it but still kept
their old habits customs and even their old clothes The flour pan in
which their daily bread was mixed stood on the rude table side by side
with the prospecting pans half full of gold washed up from their
mornings work the front windows of the newer tenements looked upon
the one single thoroughfare but the back door opened upon the uncleared
wilderness still haunted by the misshapen bulk of bear or the nightly
gliding of catamount

Neither had success as yet affected their boyish simplicity and the
frankness of old frontier habits they played with their newfound
riches with the naive delight of children and rehearsed their glowing
future with the importance and triviality of schoolboys

Ive bin kalklatin said Dick Mattingly leaning on his longhandled
shovel with lazy gravity that when I go to Rome this winter Ill get
one o them marble sharps to chisel me a statoo o some kind to set up
on the spot where we made our big strike Suthin to remember it by you
know

What kind o statooWashington or Webster asked one of the Kearney
brothers without looking up from his work

NoI reckon one o them fancy groupsone o them Latin goddesses that
Fairfax is always gassin about sorter leadin directin and bossin
us where to dig

Youd make a healthylookin figger in a group responded Kearney
critically regarding an enormous patch in Mattinglys trousers Why
dont you have a fountain instead

Wherell you get the water demanded the first speaker in return
You know there aint enough in the North Fork to do a weeks washing
for the campto say nothin of its color

Leave that to me said Kearney with selfpossession When Ive built
that there reservoir on Devils Spur and bring the water over the ridge
from Union Ditch therell be enough to spare for that

Better mix it up I reckonhave suthin half statoo half fountain
interposed the elder Mattingly better known as Maryland Joe and set
it up afore the Town Hall and Free Library Im kalklatin to give Do
THAT and you can count on me

After some further discussion it was gravely settled that Kearney
should furnish water brought from the Union Ditch twenty miles away
at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars to feed a memorial fountain
erected by Mattingly worth a hundred thousand dollars as a crowning
finish to public buildings contributed by Maryland Joe to the extent
of half a million more The disposition of these vast sums by gentlemen
wearing patched breeches awakened no sense of the ludicrous nor did any
doubt reservation or contingency enter into the plans of the charming
enthusiasts themselves The foundation of their airy castles lay already
before them in the strip of rich alluvium on the river bank where the
North Fork sharply curving round the base of Devils Spur had for
centuries swept the detritus of gulch and canyon They had barely
crossed the threshold of this treasurehouse to find themselves rich
men what possibilities of affluence might be theirs when they had fully
exploited their possessions So confident were they of that ultimate
prospect that the wealth already thus obtained was religiously expended
in engines and machinery for the boring of wells and the conveyance of
that precious water which the exhausted river had long since ceased to
yield It seemed as if the gold they had taken out was by some ironical
compensation gradually making its way back to the soil again through
ditch and flume and reservoir

Such was the position of affairs at Devils Ford on the 13th of August
1860 It was noon of a hot day Whatever movement there was in the
stifling air was seen rather than felt in a tremulous quivering
upwardmoving dust along the flank of the mountain through which the
spires of the pines were faintly visible There was no water in the
bared and burning bars of the river to reflect the vertical sun but
under its direct rays one or two tinned roofs and corrugated zinc cabins
struck fire a few canvas tents became dazzling to the eye and the
white wooded corral of the stage office and hotel insupportable For
two hours no one ventured in the glare of the open or even to cross the
narrow unshadowed street whose dull red dust seemed to glow between
the lines of straggling houses The heated shells of these green
unseasoned tenements gave out a pungent odor of scorching wood and
resin The usual hurried feverish toil in the claim was suspended
the pick and shovel were left sticking in the richest pay gravel
the toiling millionaires themselves ragged dirty and perspiring lay
panting under the nearest shade where the pipes went out listlessly
and conversation sank to monosyllables

Theres Fairfax said Dick Mattingly at last with a lazy effort His
face was turned to the hillside where a man had just emerged from
the woods and was halting irresolutely before the glaring expanse of
upheaved gravel and glistening boulders that stretched between him and
the shaded group Hes going to make a break for it he added as the
stranger throwing his linen coat over his head suddenly started into
an Indian trot through the pelting sunbeams toward them This strange
act was perfectly understood by the group who knew that in that
intensely dry heat the danger of exposure was lessened by active
exercise and the profuse perspiration that followed it In another
moment the stranger had reached their side dripping as if rained upon
mopping his damp curls and handsome bearded face with his linen coat as
he threw himself pantingly on the ground

I struck out over here first boys to give you a little warning he
said as soon as he had gained breath That engineer will be down here
to take charge as soon as the six oclock stage comes in Hes an oldish
chap has got a family of two daughters andIamdd if he is not
bringing them down here with him

Oh go long exclaimed the five men in one voice raising themselves
on their hands and elbows and glaring at the speaker

Fact boys Soon as I found it out I just waltzed into that Jew shop at
the Crossing and bought up all the clothes that would be likely to suit
you fellows before anybody else got a show I reckon I cleared out the
shop The duds are a little mixed in style but I reckon theyre clean
and whole and a man might face a lady in em I left them round at the
old Buckeye Spring where theyre handy without attracting attention
You boys can go there for a general washup rig yourselves up without
saying anything and then meander back careless and easy in your store
clothes just as the stage is coming in sabe

Why didnt you let us know earlier asked Mattingly aggrievedly
youve been back here at least an hour

Ive been getting some place ready for THEM returned the newcomer
We might have managed to put the man somewhere if hed been alone but
these women want family accommodation There was nothing left for me to
do but to buy up Thompsons saloon

No interrupted his audience half in incredulity half in
protestation

Fact You boys will have to take your drinks under canvas again I
reckon But I made Thompson let those goldframed mirrors that used to
stand behind the bar go into the bargain and they sort of furnish the
room You know the saloon is one of them patent houses you can take to
pieces and Ive been reckoning you boys will have to pitch in and help
me to take the whole shanty over to the laurel bushes and put it up
agin Kearneys cabin

Whats all that said the younger Kearney with an odd mingling of
astonishment and bashful gratification

Yes I reckon yours is the cleanest house because its the newest so
youll just step out and let us knock in one o the gables and clap it
on to the saloon and make ONE house of it dont you see Therell be
two rooms one for the girls and the other for the old man

The astonishment and bewilderment of the party had gradually given way
to a boyish and impatient interest

Hadnt we better do the job at once suggested Dick Mattingly

Or throw ourselves into those new clothes so as to be ready added
the younger Kearney looking down at his ragged trousers I say
Fairfax what are the girls like eh

All the others had been dying to ask the question yet one and all
laughed at the conscious manner and blushing cheek of the questioner

Youll find out quick enough returned Fairfax whose curt
carelessness did not however prevent a slight increase of color on his
own cheek Wed better get that job off our hands before doing anything
else So if youre ready boys well just waltz down to Thompsons and
pack up the shanty Hes out of it by this time I reckon You might
as well be perspiring to some purpose over there as gaspin under this
tree We wont go back to work this afternoon but knock off now and
call it half a day Come Hump yourselves gentlemen Are you ready
One two three and away

In another instant the tree was deserted the figures of the five
millionaires of Devils Ford crossing the fierce glare of the open
space with boyish alacrity glistened in the sunlight and then
disappeared in the nearest fringe of thickets




CHAPTER II


Six hours later when the shadow of Devils Spur had crossed the river
and spread a slight coolness over the flat beyond the Pioneer coach
leaving the summit began also to bathe its heated bulk in the long
shadows of the descent Conspicuous among the dusty passengers the
two pretty and youthful faces of the daughters of Philip Carr mining
superintendent and engineer looked from the windows with no little
anxiety towards their future home in the straggling settlement below
that occasionally came in view at the turns of the long zigzagging road
A slight look of comical disappointment passed between them as they
gazed upon the sterile flat dotted with unsightly excrescences that
stood equally for cabins or mounds of stone and gravel It was so feeble
and inconsistent a culmination to the beautiful scenery they had passed
through so hopeless and imbecile a conclusion to the preparation of
that long picturesque journey with its glimpses of sylvan and pastoral
glades and canyons that as the coach swept down the last incline
and the remorseless monotony of the dead level spread out before them
furrowed by ditches and indented by pits under cover of shielding their
cheeks from the impalpable dust that rose beneath the plunging
wheels they buried their faces in their handkerchiefs to hide a few
halfhysterical tears Happily their father completely absorbed in a
practical scientific and approving contemplation of the topography
and material resources of the scene of his future labors had no time
to notice their defection It was not until the stage drew up before
a rambling tenement bearing the inscription Hotel and Stage Office
that he became fully aware of it

We cant stop HERE papa said Christie Carr decidedly with a shake
of her pretty head You cant expect that

Mr Carr looked up at the building it was half grocery half saloon
Whatever other accommodations it contained must have been hidden in the
rear as the flat roof above was almost level with the raftered ceiling
of the shop

Certainly he replied hurriedly well see to that in a moment I
dare say its all right I told Fairfax we were coming Somebody ought
to be here

But theyre not said Jessie Carr indignantly and the few that were
here scampered off like rabbits to their burrows as soon as they saw us
get down

It was true The little group of loungers before the building had
suddenly disappeared There was the flash of a red shirt vanishing in an
adjacent doorway the fading apparition of a pair of high boots and blue
overalls in another the abrupt withdrawal of a curly blond head from a
sashless window over the way Even the saloon was deserted although
a back door in the dim recess seemed to creak mysteriously The
stagecoach with the other passengers had already rattled away

I certainly think Fairfax understood that I began Mr Carr

He was interrupted by the pressure of Christies fingers on his arm and
a subdued exclamation from Jessie who was staring down the street

What are they she whispered in her sisters ear Nigger minstrels a
circus or what

The five millionaires of Devils Ford had just turned the corner of the
straggling street and were approaching in single file One glance was
sufficient to show that they had already availed themselves of the new
clothing bought by Fairfax had washed and one or two had shaved But
the result was startling

Through some fortunate coincidence in size Dick Mattingly was the only
one who had achieved an entire new suit But it was of funereal black
cloth and although relieved at one extremity by a pair of high riding
boots in which his too short trousers were tucked and at the other
by a tall white hat and cravat of aggressive yellow the effect was
depressing In agreeable contrast his brother Maryland Joe was
attired in a thin fawncolored summer overcoat lightly worn open so as
to show the unstarched bosom of a white embroidered shirt and a pair of
nankeen trousers and pumps

The Kearney brothers had divided a suit between them the elder wearing
a tightlyfitting singlebreasted blue frockcoat and a pair of pink
striped cotton trousers while the younger candidly displayed the
trousers of his brothers suit as a harmonious change to a shining
black alpaca coat and crimson neckerchief Fairfax who brought up the
rear had with characteristic unselfishness contented himself with a
French workmans blue blouse and a pair of white duck trousers Had they
shown the least consciousness of their finery or of its absurdity they
would have seemed despicable But only one expression beamed on the five
sunburnt and shining facesa look of unaffected boyish gratification
and unrestricted welcome

They halted before Mr Carr and his daughters simultaneously removed
their various and remarkable head coverings and waited until Fairfax
advanced and severally presented them Jessie Carrs halffrightened
smile took refuge in the trembling shadows of her dark lashes Christie
Carr stiffened slightly and looked straight before her

We reckonedthat iswe intended to meet you and the young ladies at
the grade said Fairfax reddening a little as he endeavored to
conceal his too ready slang and save you from trapesingfrom dragging
yourselves up grade again to your house

Then there IS a house said Jessie with an alarming frank laugh
of relief that was however as frankly reflected in the boyishly
appreciative eyes of the young men

Such as it is responded Fairfax with a shade of anxiety as he
glanced at the fresh and pretty costumes of the young women and
dubiously regarded the two Saratoga trunks resting hopelessly on the
veranda Im afraid it isnt much for what youre accustomed to But
he added more cheerfully it will do for a day or two and perhaps
youll give us the pleasure of showing you the way there now

The procession was quickly formed Mr Carr alive only to the actual
business that had brought him there at once took possession of
Fairfax and began to disclose his plans for the working of the mine
occasionally halting to look at the work already done in the ditches
and to examine the field of his future operations Fairfax not
displeased at being thus relieved of a lighter attendance on Mr
Carrs daughters nevertheless from time to time cast a paternal glance
backwards upon their escorts who had each seized a handle of the two
trunks and were carrying them in couples at the young ladies side The
occupation did not offer much freedom for easy gallantry but no sign
of discomfiture or uneasiness was visible in the grateful faces of the
young men The necessity of changing hands at times with their burdens
brought a corresponding change of cavalier at the ladys side although
it was observed that the younger Kearney for the sake of continuing a
conversation with Miss Jessie kept his grasp of the handle nearest the
young lady until his hand was nearly cut through and his arm worn out
by exhaustion

The only thing on wheels in the camp is a mule wagon and the mules are
packin gravel from the river this afternoon explained Dick Mattingly
apologetically to Christie or wed have totedI mean carriedyou and
your baggage up to the shanttheyour house Give us two weeks more
Miss Carronly two weeks to wash up our work and realizeand well
give you a pair of 240 steppers and a skeleton buggy to meet you at the
top of the hill and drive you over to the cabin Perhaps youd prefer
a regular carriage some ladies do And a nigger driver But whats the
use of planning anything Afore that time comes well have run you up
a house on the hill and you shall pick out the spot It wouldnt take
longunless you preferred brick I suppose we could get brick over from
La Grange if you cared for it but it would take longer If you
could put up for a time with something of stained glass and a mahogany
veranda

In spite of her cold indignation and the fact that she could understand
only a part of Mattinglys speech Christie comprehended enough to make
her lift her clear eyes to the speaker as she replied freezingly that
she feared she would not trouble them long with her company

Oh youll get over that responded Mattingly with an exasperating
confidence that drove her nearly frantic from the manifest kindliness
of intent that made it impossible for her to resent it I felt that way
myself at first Things will look strange and unsociable for a while
until you get the hang of them Youll naturally stamp round and cuss a
little He stopped in conscious consternation

With ready tact and before Christie could reply Maryland Joe had put
down the trunk and changed hands with his brother

You mustnt mind Dick or hell go off and kill himself with shame he
whispered laughingly in her ear He means all right but hes picked
up so much slang here that hes about forgotten how to talk English and
its nigh on to four years since hes met a young lady

Christie did not reply Yet the laughter of her sister in advance with
the Kearney brothers seemed to make the reserve with which she tried to
crush further familiarity only ridiculous

Do you know many operas Miss Carr

She looked at the boyish interested sunburnt face so near to her
own and hesitated After all why should she add to her other real
disappointments by taking this absurd creature seriously

In what way she returned with a half smile

To play On the piano of course There isnt one nearer here than
Sacramento but I reckon we could get a small one by Thursday You
couldnt do anything on a banjo he added doubtfully Kearneys got
one

I imagine it would be very difficult to carry a piano over those
mountains said Christie laughingly to avoid the collateral of the
banjo

We got a billiardtable over from Stockton half bashfully interrupted
Dick Mattingly struggling from his end of the trunk to recover his
composure and it had to be brought over in sections on the back of a
mule so I dont see why He stopped short again in confusion at a
sign from his brother and then added I mean of course that a piano
is a heap more delicate and valuable and all that sort of thing but
its worth trying for

Fairfax was always saying hed get one for himself so I reckon its
possible said Joe

Does he play asked Christie

You bet said Joe quite forgetting himself in his enthusiasm He can
snatch Mozart and Beethoven baldheaded

In the embarrassing silence that followed this speech the fringe of pine
wood nearest the flat was reached Here there was a rude clearing and
beneath an enormous pine stood the two recently joined tenements There
was no attempt to conceal the point of junction between Kearneys
cabin and the newlytransported saloon from the flatno architectural
illusion of the palpable collusion of the two buildings which seemed
to be telescoped into each other The front room or living room occupied
the whole of Kearneys cabin It contained in addition to the necessary
articles for housekeeping a bunk or berth for Mr Carr so as to
leave the second building entirely to the occupation of his daughters as
bedroom and boudoir

There was a halfhumorous halfapologetic exhibition of the rude
utensils of the living room and then the young men turned away as the
two girls entered the open door of the second room Neither Christie nor
Jessie could for a moment understand the delicacy which kept these young
men from accompanying them into the room they had but a few moments
before decorated and arranged with their own hands and it was not until
they turned to thank their strange entertainers that they found that
they were gone

The arrangement of the second room was rude and bizarre but not without
a singular originality and even tastefulness of conception What had
been the counter or bar of the saloon gorgeous in white and gold
now sawn in two and divided was set up on opposite sides of the room as
separate dressingtables decorated with huge bunches of azaleas that
hid the rough earthenware bowls and gave each table the appearance of a
vestal altar

The huge gilt plateglass mirror which had hung behind the bar still
occupied one side of the room but its length was artfully divided by
an enormous rosette of red white and blue muslinone of the surviving
Fourth of July decorations of Thompsons saloon On either side of the
door two patheticlooking conventlike cots covered with spotless
sheeting and heaped up in the middle like a snowcovered grave had
attracted their attention They were still staring at them when Mr Carr
anticipated their curiosity

I ought to tell you that the young men confided to me the fact that
there was neither bed nor mattress to be had on the Ford They have
filled some flour sacks with clean dry moss from the woods and put half
a dozen blankets on the top and they hope you can get along until
the messenger who starts tonight for La Grange can bring some bedding
over

Jessie flew with mischievous delight to satisfy herself of the truth
of this marvel Its so Christie she said laughinglythree
floursacks apiece but Im jealous yours are all marked superfine
and mine middlings

Mr Carr had remained uneasily watching Christies shadowed face

What matters she said drily The accommodation is all in keeping

It will be better in a day or two he continued casting a longing
look towards the doorthe first refuge of masculine weakness in an
impending domestic emergency Ill go and see what can be done he
said feebly with a sidelong impulse towards the opening and freedom
Ive got to see Fairfax again tonight any way

One moment father said Christie wearily Did you know anything of
this place and thesethese peoplebefore you came

Certainlyof course I did he returned with the sudden testiness of
disturbed abstraction What are you thinking of I knew the geological
strata and thethe report of Fairfax and his partners before I
consented to take charge of the works And I can tell you that there is
a fortune here I intend to make my own terms and share in it

And not take a salary or some sum of money down said Christie slowly
removing her bonnet in the same resigned way

I am not a hired man or a workman Christie said her father sharply
You ought not to oblige me to remind you of that

But the hired menthe superintendent and his workmenwere the only
ones who ever got anything out of your last experience with Colonel
Waters at La Grange andand we at least lived among civilized people
there

These young men are not common people Christie even if they have
forgotten the restraints of speech and manners theyre gentlemen

Who are willing to live likelike negroes

You can make them what you please

Christie raised her eyes There was a certain cynical ring in her
fathers voice that was unlike his usual hesitating abstraction It both
puzzled and pained her

I mean he said hastily that you have the same opportunity to direct
the lives of these young men into more regular disciplined channels
that I have to regulate and correct their foolish waste of industry and
material here It would at least beguile the time for you

Fortunately for Mr Carrs escape and Christies uneasiness Jessie who
had been examining the details of the livingroom broke in upon this
conversation

Im sure it will be as good as a perpetual picnic George Kearney says
we can have a cookingstove under the tree outside at the back and as
there will be no rain for three months we can do the cooking there
and that will give us more room forfor the piano when it comes
and theres an old squaw to do the cleaning and washingup any
dayandandit will be real fun

She stopped breathlessly with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyesa
charming picture of youth and trustfulness Mr Carr had seized the
opportunity to escape

Really now Christie said Jessie confidentially when they were
alone and Christie had begun to unpack her trunk and to mechanically
put her things away theyre not so bad

Who asked Christie

Why the Kearneys and Mattinglys and Fairfax and the lot provided
you dont look at their clothes And think of it they told mefor they
tell one EVERYTHING in the most alarming waythat those clothes were
bought to please US A scramble of things bought at La Grange without
reference to size or style And to hear these creatures talk why youd
think they were Astors or Rothschilds Think of that little one with
the curlsI dont believe he is over seventeen for all his baby
moustachesays hes going to build an assembly hall for us to give
a dance in next month and apologizes the next breath to tell us that
there isnt any milk to be had nearer than La Grange and we must do
without it and use syrup in our tea tomorrow

And where is all this wealth said Christie forcing herself to smile
at her sisters animation

Under our very feet my child and all along the river Why what
we thought was pure and simple mud is what they call goldbearing
cement

I suppose that is why they dont brush their boots and trousers its
so precious returned Christie drily And have they ever translated
this precious dirt into actual coin

Bless you yes Why that dirty little gutter you know that ran along
the side of the road and followed us down the hill all the way here
that cost themlet me seeyes nearly sixty thousand dollars And
fancy papas just condemned itsays it wont do and theyve got to
build another

An impatient sigh from Christie drew Jessies attention to her troubled
eyebrows

Dont worry about our disappointment dear It isnt so very great I
dare say well be able to get along here in some way until papa is rich
again You know they intend to make him share with them

It strikes me that he is sharing with them already said Christie
glancing bitterly round the cabin sharing everythingourselves our
lives our tastes

Yees said Jessie with vaguely hesitating assent Yes even
these she showed two dice in the palm of her little hand I found em
in the drawer of our dressingtable

Throw them away said Christie impatiently

But Jessies small fingers closed over the dice Ill give them to the
little Kearney I dare say they were the poor boys playthings

The appearance of these relics of wild dissipation however had lifted
Christie out of her sublime resignation For Heavens sake Jessie
she said look around and see if there is anything more

To make sure they each began to scrimmage the brokenspirited Christie
exhibiting both alacrity and penetration in searching obscure corners
In the diningroom behind the dresser three or four books were
discovered an odd volume of Thackeray another of Dickens a
memorandumbook or diary This seems to be Latin said Jessie fishing
out a smaller book I cant read it

Its just as well you shouldnt said Christie shortly whose ideas
of a general classical impropriety had been gathered from pages of
Lemprieres dictionary Put it back directly

Jessie returned certain odes of one Horatius Flaccus to the corner and
uttered an exclamation Oh Christie here are some letters tied up
with a ribbon

They were two or three prettily written letters exhaling a faint odor
of refinement and of the pressed flowers that peeped from between the
loose leaves I see My darling Fairfax Its from some woman

I dont think much of her whosoever she is said Christie tossing
the intact packet back into the corner

Nor I echoed Jessie

Nevertheless by some feminine inconsistency evidently the circumstance
did make them think more of HIM for a minute later when they had
reentered their own room Christie remarked The idea of petting a
man by his family name Think of mamma ever having called papa darling
Carr

Oh but his family name isnt Fairfax said Jessie hastily thats
his FIRST name his Christian name I forget whats his other name but
nobody ever calls him by it

Do you mean said Christie with glistening eyes and awful
deliberationdo you mean to say that were expected to fall in with
this insufferable familiarity I suppose theyll be calling US by our
Christian names next

Oh but they do said Jessie mischievously

What

They call me Miss Jessie and Kearney the little one asked me if
Christie played

And what did you say

I said that you did answered Jessie with an affectation of cherubic
simplicity You do dear dont you    There dont get angry
darling I couldnt flare up all of a sudden in the face of that poor
little creature he looked so absurdand soso honest

Christie turned away relapsing into her old resigned manner and
assuming her household duties in a quiet temporizing way that was
however without hope or expectation

Mr Carr who had dined with his friends under the excuse of not adding
to the awkwardness of the first days housekeeping returned late at
night with a mass of papers and drawings into which he afterwards
withdrew but not until he had delivered himself of a mysterious package
entrusted to him by the young men for his daughters It contained a
contribution to their board in the shape of a silver spoon and battered
silver mug which Jessie chose to facetiously consider as an affecting
reminiscence of the youthful Kearneys christening dayswhich it
probably was

The young girls retired early to their white snowdrifts Jessie not
without some hilarious struggles with hers in which she was however
quickly surprised by the deep and refreshing sleep of youth Christie to
lie awake and listen to the night wind that had changed from the first
cool whispers of sunset to the sturdy breath of the mountain At times
the frail house shook and trembled Wandering gusts laden with the
deep resinous odors of the wood found their way through the imperfect
jointure of the two cabins swept her cheek and even stirred her long
wideopen lashes A broken spray of pine needles rustled along the roof
or a pine cone dropped with a quick reverberating taptap that for an
instant startled her Lying thus wide awake she fell into a dreamy
reminiscence of the past hearing snatches of old melody in the moving
pines fragments of sentences old words and familiar epithets in the
murmuring wind at her ear and even the faint breath of longforgotten
kisses on her cheek She remembered her mothera pallid creature who
had slowly faded out of one of her fathers vague speculations in a
vaguer speculation of her own beyond his kenwhose place she had
promised to take at her fathers side The words Watch over him
Christie he needs a womans care again echoed in her ears as if
borne on the night wind from the lonely grave in the lonelier cemetery
by the distant sea She had devoted herself to him with some little
sacrifices of self only remembered now for their uselessness in
saving her father the disappointment that sprang from his sanguine and
oneidead temperament She thought of him lying asleep in the other
room ready on the morrow to devote those fateful qualities to the new
enterprise that with equally fateful disposition she believed would end
in failure It did not occur to her that the doubts of her own practical
nature were almost as dangerous and illogical as his enthusiasm and
that for that reason she was fast losing what little influence she
possessed over him With the example of her mothers weakness before her
eyes she had become an unsparing and distrustful critic with the sole
effect of awakening his distrust and withdrawing his confidence from
her

He was beginning to deceive her as he had never deceived her mother
Even Jessie knew more of this last enterprise than she did herself

All that did not tend to decrease her utter restlessness It was already
past midnight when she noticed that the wind had again abated The
mountain breeze had by this time possessed the stifling valleys and
heated bars of the river in its strong cold embraces the equilibrium
of Nature was restored and a shadowy mist rose from the hollow A
stillness more oppressive and intolerable than the previous commotion
began to pervade the house and the surrounding woods She could hear the
regular breathing of the sleepers she even fancied she could detect the
faint impulses of the more distant life in the settlement The faroff
barking of a dog a lost shout the indistinct murmur of some nearer
watercoursemere phantoms of soundmade the silence more irritating
With a sudden resolution she arose dressed herself quietly and
completely threw a heavy cloak over her head and shoulders and opened
the door between the livingroom and her own Her father was sleeping
soundly in his bunk in the corner She passed noiselessly through the
room opened the lightly fastened door and stepped out into the night

In the irritation and disgust of her walk hither she had never noticed
the situation of the cabin as it nestled on the slope at the fringe of
the woods in the preoccupation of her disappointment and the mechanical
putting away of her things she had never looked once from the window of
her room or glanced backward out of the door that she had entered The
view before her was a revelationa reproach a surprise that took away
her breath Over her shoulders the newly risen moon poured a flood of
silvery light stretching from her feet across the shining bars of the
river to the opposite bank and on up to the very crest of the
Devils Spurno longer a huge bulk of crushing shadow but the steady
exaltation of plateau spur and terrace clothed with replete and
unutterable beauty In this magical light that beauty seemed to be
sustained and carried along by the river winding at its base lifted
again to the broad shoulder of the mountain and lost only in the
distant vista of deathlike overcrowning snow Behind and above where
she stood the towering woods seemed to be waiting with opened ranks
to absorb her with the little cabin she had quitted dwarfed into
insignificance in the vast prospect but nowhere was there another sign
or indication of human life and habitation She looked in vain for
the settlement for the rugged ditches the scattered cabins and the
unsightly heaps of gravel In the glamour of the moonlight they had
vanished a veil of silvergray vapor touched here and there with ebony
shadows masked its site A black strip beyond was the river bank All
else was changed With a sudden sense of awe and loneliness she turned
to the cabin and its sleeping inmatesall that seemed left to her in
the vast and stupendous domination of rock and wood and sky

But in another moment the loneliness passed A new and delicious sense
of an infinite hospitality and friendliness in their silent presence
began to possess her This same slighted forgotten uncomprehended
but still foolish and forgiving Nature seemed to be bending over her
frightened and listening ear with vague but thrilling murmurings of
freedom and independence She felt her heart expand with its wholesome
breath her soul fill with its sustaining truth

She felt

What was that

An unmistakable outburst of a drunken song at the foot of the slope

 Oh my name it is Johnny from Pike
 Im hll on a spree or a strike   

She stopped as crimson with shame and indignation as if the viewless
singer had risen before her

 I knew when to bet and get up and get

Hush Dn it all Dont you hear

There was the sound of hurried whispers a No and Yes and then a
dead silence

Christie crept nearer to the edge of the slope in the shadow of a
buckeye In the clearer view she could distinguish a staggering
figure in the trail below who had evidently been stopped by two other
expostulating shadows that were approaching from the shelter of a tree

Shodidnt know

The staggering figure endeavored to straighten itself and then slouched
away in the direction of the settlement The two mysterious shadows
retreated again to the tree and were lost in its deeper shadow
Christie darted back to the cabin and softly reentered her room

I thought I heard a noise that woke me and I missed you said Jessie
rubbing her eyes Did you see anything

No said Christie beginning to undress

You werent frightened dear

Not in the least said Christie with a strange little laugh Go to
sleep




CHAPTER III


The five impulsive millionaires of Devils Ford fulfilled not a few of
their most extravagant promises In less than six weeks Mr Carr and
his daughters were installed in a new house built near the site of the
double cabin which was again transferred to the settlement in order
to give greater seclusion to the fair guests It was a long roomy
onestoried villa with a not unpicturesque combination of deep veranda
and trellis work which relieved the flat monotony of the interior and
the barrenness of the freshlycleared ground An upright piano brought
from Sacramento occupied the corner of the parlor A suite of gorgeous
furniture whose pronounced and extravagant glories the young girls
instinctively hid under homemade linen covers had also been spoils
from afar Elsewhere the house was filled with ornaments and decorations
that in their incongruity forcibly recalled the gilded plateglass
mirrors of the bedroom in the old cabin In the hasty furnishing of
this Aladdins palace the slaves of the ring had evidently seized
upon anything that would add to its glory without reference always to
fitness

I wish it didnt look so cussedly like a robbers cave said George
Kearney when they were taking a quiet preliminary survey of the
unclassified treasures before the Carrs took possession

Or a gambling hell said his brother reflectively

Its about the same thing I reckon said Dick Mattingly who was
supposed in his fiery youth to have encountered the similarity

Nevertheless the two girls managed to bestow the heterogeneous
collection with tasteful adaptation to their needs A crystal
chandelier which had once lent a fascinating illusion to the game of
Monte hung unlighted in the broad hall where a few other bizarre and
public articles were relegated A long red sofa or bench which had done
duty beside a billiardtable found a place here also Indeed it is to
be feared that some of the more rustic and bashful youths of Devils
Ford who had felt it incumbent upon them to pay their respects to
the newcomers were more at ease in this vestibule than in the arcana
beyond whose glories they could see through the open door To others
it represented a recognized state of probation before their reentree
into civilization again I reckon if you dont mind miss said the
spokesman of one party ez this is our first call well sorter hang
out in the hall yer until your used to us On another occasion one
Whiskey Dick impelled by a sense of duty paid a visit to the new house
and its fair occupants in a fashion frankly recounted by him afterwards
at the bar of the Tecumseh Saloon

You see boys I dropped in there the other night when some of you
fellers was doin the hightoned thankee marm business in the parlor
I just came to anchor in the corner of the sofy in the hall without
lettin on to say that I was there and took up a Websters dictionary
that was on the table and laid it openkeerless like on my knees ez
if I was sorter consultin itand kinder dozed off there listenin to
you fellows gassin with the young ladies and that yer Miss Christie
just snakin music outer that pianner and I reckon I fell asleep
Anyhow I was there nigh on to two hours Its mighty soothin them
fashionable calls sorter knocks the old camp dust outer a fellow and
sets him up again

It would have been well if the new life of the Devils Ford had shown
no other irregularity than the harmless eccentricities of its original
locaters But the news of its sudden fortune magnified by report began
presently to flood the settlement with another class of adventurers
A tide of waifs strays and malcontents of old camps along the river
began to set towards Devils Ford in very much the same fashion as the
debris drift and alluvium had been carried down in bygone days and
cast upon its banks A few immigrant wagons diverted from the highways
of travel by the fame of the new diggings halted upon the slopes of
Devils Spur and on the arid flats of the Ford and disgorged their
sallow freight of alkalipoisoned prematurelyaged women and children
and maimed and feverstricken men Against this rude form of domesticity
were opposed the chromotinted dresses and extravagant complexions of
a few single unattended womenhappily seen more often at night behind
gilded bars than in the garish light of dayand an equal number of
palefaced darkmoustached welldressed and suspiciously idle men
A dozen rivals of Thompsons Saloon had sprung up along the narrow
main street There were two new hotelsone a Temperance House whose
ascetic quality was confined only to the abnegation of whiskeya rival
stage office and a small onestoried building from which the Sierran
Banner fluttered weekly for ten dollars a year in advance
Insufferable in the glare of a Sabbath sun bleak windy and flaring in
the gloom of a Sabbath night and hopelessly depressing on all days of
the week the First Presbyterian Church lifted its blunt steeple from
the barrenest area of the flats and was hideous The civic improvements
so enthusiastically contemplated by the five millionaires in the earlier
pages of this veracious chroniclethe fountain reservoir townhall
and free libraryhad not yet been erected Their sites had been
anticipated by more urgent buildings and mining works unfortunately
not considered in the sanguine dreams of the enthusiasts and more
significant still their cost and expense had been also anticipated by
the enormous outlay of their earnings in the work upon Devils Ditch

Nevertheless the liberal fulfilment of their promise in the new house
in the suburbs blinded the young girls eyes to their shortcomings in
the town Their own remoteness and elevation above its feverish life
kept them from the knowledge of much that was strange and perhaps
disturbing to their equanimity As they did not mix with the immigrant
womenMiss Jessies goodnatured intrusion into one of their
halfnomadic camps one day having been met with rudeness and
suspicionthey gradually fell into the way of trusting the
responsibility of new acquaintances to the hands of their original
hosts and of consulting them in the matter of local recreation It thus
occurred that one day the two girls on their way to the main street for
an hours shopping at the Villa de Paris and Variety Store were stopped
by Dick Mattingly a few yards from their house with the remark that as
the county election was then in progress it would be advisable for
them to defer their intention for a few hours As he did not deem it
necessary to add that two citizens in the exercise of a freemans
franchise had been supplementing their ballots with bullets in front
of an admiring crowd they knew nothing of that accident that removed
from Devils Ford an entertaining stranger who had only the night
before partaken of their hospitality

A week or two later returning one morning from a stroll in the forest
Christie and Jessie were waylaid by George Kearney and Fairfax and
under pretext of being shown a new and romantic trail were diverted
from the regular path This enabled Mattingly and Maryland Joe to cut
down the body of a man hanged by the Vigilance Committee a few hours
before on the regular trail and to remonstrate with the committee
on the incompatibility of such exhibitions with a maidenly worship of
nature

With the whole county to hang a man in expostulated Joe you might
keep clear of Carrs woods

It is needless to add that the young girls never knew of this act of
violence or the delicacy that kept them in ignorance of it Mr Carr
was too absorbed in business to give heed to what he looked upon as
a convulsion of society as natural as a geological upheaval and too
prudent to provoke the criticism of his daughters by comment in their
presence

An equally unexpected confidence however took its place Mr Carr
having finished his coffee one morning lingered a moment over his
perfunctory paternal embraces with the awkwardness of a preoccupied
man endeavoring by the assumption of a lighter interest to veil another
abstraction

And what are we doing today Christie he asked as Jessie left the
diningroom

Oh pretty much the usual thingnothing in particular If George
Kearney gets the horses from the summit were going to ride over to
Indian Spring to picnic FairfaxMr MunroeI always forget that mans
real name in this dreadfully familiar countrywell hes coming to
escort us and take me I supposethat is if Kearney takes Jessie

A very nice arrangement returned her father with a slight nervous
contraction of the corners of his mouth and eyelids to indicate
mischievousness Ive no doubt theyll both be here You know they
usually areha ha And what about the two Mattinglys and Philip
Kearney eh he continued wont they be jealous

It isnt their turn said Christie carelessly besides theyll
probably be there

And I suppose theyre beginning to be resigned said Carr smiling

What on earth are you talking of father

She turned her clear brown eyes upon him and was regarding him with
such manifest unconsciousness of the drift of his speech and withal
a little vague impatience of his archness that Mr Carr was feebly
alarmed It had the effect of banishing his assumed playfulness which
made his serious explanation the more irritating

Well I rather thought thatthat young Kearney was paying considerable
attention tototo Jessie replied her father with hesitating
gravity

What that boy

Young Kearney is one of the original locators and an equal partner in
the mine A very enterprising young fellow In fact much more advanced
and bolder in his conceptions than the others I find no difficulty with
him

At another time Christie would have questioned the convincing quality
of this proof but she was too much shocked at her fathers first
suggestion to think of anything else

You dont mean to say father that you are talking seriously of these
menyour friendswhom we see every dayand our only company

No no said Mr Carr hastily you misunderstand I dont suppose
that Jessie or you

Or ME Am I included

You dont let me speak Christie I mean I am not talking seriously
continued Mr Carr with his most serious aspect of you and Jessie
in this matter but it may be a serious thing to these young men to be
thrown continually in the company of two attractive girls

I understandyou mean that we should not see so much of them said
Christie with a frank expression of relief so genuine as to utterly
discompose her father Perhaps you are right though I fail to
discover anything serious in the attentions of young Kearney to
Jessieorwhoever it may beto me But it will be very easy to
remedy it and see less of them Indeed we might begin today with some
excuse

Yescertainly Of course said Mr Carr fully convinced of his
utter failure but like most weak creatures consoling himself with the
reflection that he had not shown his hand or committed himself Yes
but it would perhaps be just as well for the present to let things go on
as they were Well talk of it againIm in a hurry now and edging
himself through the door he slipped away

What do you think is fathers last idea said Christie with I fear
a slight lack of reverence in her tone as her sister reentered the
room He thinks George Kearney is paying you too much attention

No said Jessie replying to her sisters halfinterrogative
halfamused glance with a frank unconscious smile

Yes and he says that FairfaxI think its Fairfaxis equally
fascinated with ME

Jessies brow slightly contracted as she looked curiously at her sister

Of all things she said I wonder if any one has put that idea into
his dear old head He couldnt have thought it himself

I dont know said Christie musingly but perhaps its just as well
if we kept a little more to ourselves for a while

Did father say so said Jessie quickly

No but that is evidently what he meant

Yees said Jessie slowly unless

Unless what said Christie sharply Jessie you dont for a moment
mean to say that you could possibly conceive of anything else

I mean to say said Jessie stealing her arm around her sisters waist
demurely that you are perfectly right Well keep away from these
fascinating Devils Forders and particularly the youngest Kearney
I believe there has been some illnatured gossip I remember that the
other day when we passed the shanty of that Pike County family on
the slope there were three women at the door and one of them said
something that made poor little Kearney turn white and pink alternately
and dance with suppressed rage I suppose the old ladyMCorkle thats
her namewould like to have a share of our cavaliers for her Euphemy
and Mamie I dare say its only right I would lend them the cherub
occasionally and you might let them have Mr Munroe twice a week

She laughed but her eyes sought her sisters with a certain
watchfulness of expression

Christie shrugged her shoulders with a suggestion of disgust

Dont joke We ought to have thought of all this before

But when we first knew them in the dear old cabin there wasnt any
other woman and nobody to gossip and thats what made it so nice I
dont think so very much of civilization do you said the young lady
pertly

Christie did not reply Perhaps she was thinking the same thing It
certainly had been very pleasant to enjoy the spontaneous and chivalrous
homage of these men with no further suggestion of recompense or
responsibility than the permission to be worshipped but beyond that she
racked her brain in vain to recall any look or act that proclaimed the
lover These men whom she had found so relapsed into barbarism that
they had forgotten the most ordinary forms of civilization these
men even in whose extravagant admiration there was a certain loss of
selfrespect that as a woman she would never forgive these men who
seemed to belong to another raceimpossible Yet it was so

What construction must they have put upon her fathers acceptance of
their presentsof their companyof her freedom in their presence No
they must have understood from the beginning that she and her sister
had never looked upon them except as transient hosts and chance
acquaintances Any other idea was preposterous And yet

It was the recurrence of this yet that alarmed her For she remembered
now that but for their slavish devotion they might claim to be her
equal According to her fathers account they had come from homes as
good as their own they were certainly more than her equal in fortune
and her father had come to them as an employee until they had taken him
into partnership If there had only been sentiment of any kind
connected with any of them But they were all alike brave unselfish
humorousand often ridiculous If anything Dick Mattingly was funniest
by nature and made her laugh more Maryland Joe his brother told
better stories sometimes of Dick though not so good a mimic as the
other Kearney who had a fairly sympathetic voice in singing They were
all goodlooking enough perhaps they set store on thatmen are so
vain

And as for her own rejected suitor Fairfax Munroe except for a kind of
grave and proper motherliness about his protecting manner he absolutely
was the most indistinctive of them all He had once brought her some
rare tea from the Chinese camp and had taught her how to make it he
had cautioned her against sitting under the trees at nightfall he had
once taken off his coat to wrap around her Really if this were the
only evidence of devotion that could be shown she was safe

Well said Jessie it amuses you I see

Christie checked the smile that had been dimpling the cheek nearest
Jessie and turned upon her the face of an elder sister

Tell me have YOU noticed this extraordinary attention of Mr Munroe to
me

Candidly asked Jessie seating herself comfortably on the table
sideways and endeavoring to pull her skirt over her little feet
Honest Injun

Dont be idiotic and above all dont be slangy Of course
candidly

Well no I cant say that I have

Then said Christie why in the name of all thats preposterous do
they persist in pairing me off with the least interesting man of the
lot

Jessie leaped from the table

Come now she said with a little nervous laugh hes not so bad as
all that You dont know him But what does it matter now as long as
were not going to see them any more

Theyre coming here for the ride today said Christie resignedly
Father thought it better not to break it off at once

Father thought so echoed Jessie stopping with her hand on the door

Yes why do you ask

But Jessie had already left the room and was singing in the hall


CHAPTER IV


The afternoon did not however bring their expected visitors It
brought instead a brief note by the hands of Whiskey Dick from
Fairfax apologizing for some business that kept him and George Kearney
from accompanying the ladies It added that the horses were at the
disposal of themselves and any escort they might select if they would
kindly give the message to Whiskey Dick

The two girls looked at each other awkwardly Jessie did not attempt to
conceal a slight pout

It looks as if they were anticipating us she said with a halfforced
smile I wonder now if there really has been any gossip But no They
wouldnt have stopped for that unless She looked curiously at her
sister

Unless what repeated Christie you are horribly mysterious this
morning

Am I Its nothing But theyre wanting an answer Of course youll
decline

And intimate we only care for their company No Well say were sorry
they cant come andaccept their horses We can do without an escort
we two

Capital said Jessie clapping her hands Well show them

Well show them nothing interrupted Christie decidedly In our place
theres only the one thing to do Where is thisWhiskey Dick

In the parlor

The parlor echoed Christie Whiskey Dick Whatis he

Yes hes all right said Jessie confidently Hes been here before
but he stayed in the hall he was so shy I dont think you saw him

I should think notWhiskey Dick

Oh you can call him Mr Hall if you like said Jessie laughing
His real name is Dick Hall If you want to be funny you can say Alky
Hall as the others do

Christies only reply to this levity was a look of superior resignation
as she crossed the hall and entered the parlor

Then ensued one of those surprising mystifying and utterly
inexplicable changes that leave the masculine being so helpless in the
hands of his feminine master Before Christie opened the door her face
underwent a rapid transformation the gentle glow of a refined womans
welcome suddenly beamed in her interested eyes the impulsive courtesy
of an expectant hostess eagerly seizing a longlookedfor opportunity
broke in a smile upon her lips as she swept across the room and stopped
with her two white outstretched hands before Whiskey Dick

It needed only the extravagant contrast presented by that gentleman to
complete the tableau Attired in a suit of shining black alpaca the
visitor had evidently prepared himself with some care for a possible
interview He was seated by the French window opening upon the veranda
as if to secure a retreat in case of an emergency Scrupulously washed
and shaven some of the soap appeared to have lingered in his eyes and
inflamed the lids even while it lent a sleek and shining lustre not
unlike his coat to his smooth black hair Nevertheless leaning back
in his chair he had allowed a large white handkerchief to depend
gracefully from his fingersa pose at once suggesting easy and elegant
langour

How kind of you to give me an opportunity to make up for my misfortune
when you last called I was so sorry to have missed you But it was
entirely my fault You were hurried I thinkyou conversed with others
in the hallyou

She stopped to assist him to pick up the handkerchief that had fallen
and the Panama hat that had rolled from his lap towards the window
when he had started suddenly to his feet at the apparition of grace and
beauty As he still nervously retained the two hands he had grasped
this would have been a difficult feat even had he not endeavored at the
same moment by a backward furtive kick to propel the hat out of the
window at which she laughingly broke from his grasp and flew to the
rescue

Dont mind it miss he said hurriedly It is not worth your
demeaning yourself to touch it Leave it outside thar miss I wouldnt
have toted it in anyhow if some of those highfalutin fellows hadnt
allowed the other night ez it were the reglar thing to do as if
miss any gentleman kalkilated to ever put on his hat in the house afore
a lady

But Christie had already possessed herself of the unlucky object and
had placed it upon the table This compelled Whiskey Dick to rise again
and as an act of careless good breeding to drop his handkerchief in it
He then leaned one elbow upon the piano and crossing one foot over the
other remained standing in an attitude he remembered to have seen
in the pages of an illustrated paper as portraying the hero in some
drawingroom scene It was easy and effective but seemed to be more
favorable to revery than conversation Indeed he remembered that he had
forgotten to consult the letterpress as to which it represented

I see you agree with me that politeness is quite a matter of
intention said Christie and not of mere fashion and rules Now for
instance she continued with a dazzling smile I suppose according
to the rules I ought to give you a note to Mr Munroe accepting his
offer That is all that is required but it seems so much nicer dont
you think to tell it to YOU for HIM and have the pleasure of your
company and a little chat at the same time

Thats it thats just it Miss Carr youve hit it in the centre this
time said Whiskey Dick now quite convinced that his attitude was not
intended for eloquence and shifting back to his own seat hat and all
thats tantamount to what I said to the boys just now You want an
excuse sez I for not goin out with the young ladies So accorden
to rules you writes a letter allowin buzziness and that sorter thing
detains you But wots the facts Youre a gentleman and as gentlemen
you and George comes to the opinion that youre rather playin it for
all its worth in this yer house you knowcomin here night and day
off and on reglar sociable and famly like and makin people talk
about things they aint any call to talk about and whats a darned
sight more YOU FELLOWS aint got any right YET to allow em to talk
about dye see he paused out of breath

It was Miss Christies turn to move about In changing her seat to the
pianostool so as to be nearer her visitor she brushed down some loose
music which Whiskey Dick hastened to pick up

Pray dont mind it she said pray dont reallylet it be
But Whiskey Dick feeling himself on safe ground in this attention
persisted to the bitter end of a disintegrated and wellworn
Travatore So that is what Mr Munroe said she remarked quietly

Not just then in course but its whats bin on his mind and in his
talk for days off and on returned Dick with a knowing smile and a nod
of mysterious confidence Bless your soul Miss Carr folks like you
and me dont need to have them things explained Thats what I said to
him sez I Dont send no note but just go up there and hev it out
fair and square and say what you do mean But they would hev the note
and I kalkilated to bring it But when I set my eyes on you and heard
you express yourself as you did just now I sez to myself sez I Dick
yers a young lady and a fashnable lady at that ez dont go foolin
round on rules and etikettsexcuse my freedom Miss Carrand you and
her sez I kin just discuss this yer matter in a sociable offhand
fashnable way Theyre a good lot o boys Miss Carr a square
lotwhite men all of em but theyre a little soft and green may be
from livin in these yer pine woods along o the other sap They just
worship the ground you and your sister tread oncertain of course
of course he added hurriedly recognizing Christies halfconscious
deprecating gesture with more exaggerated deprecation I understand
But what I wanter say is that theyd be willin to be that ground
and lie down and let you walk over themso to speak Miss Carr so to
speakif it would keep the hem of your gown from gettin soiled in the
mud o the camp But it wouldnt do for them to make a reglar curderoy
road o themselves for the houl camp to trapse over on the mere chance
of your some time passin that way would it now

Wont you let me offer you some refreshment Mr Hall said Christie
rising with a slight color Im really ashamed of my forgetfulness
again but Im afraid its partly YOUR fault for entertaining me to the
exclusion of yourself No thank you let me fetch it for you

She turned to a handsome sideboard near the door and presently faced
him again with a decanter of whiskey and a glass in her hand and a
return of the bewitching smile she had worn on entering

But perhaps you dont take whiskey suggested the arch deceiver with
a sudden affected but pretty perplexity of eye brow and lips

For the first time in his life Whiskey Dick hesitated between two forms
of intoxication But he was still nervous and uneasy habit triumphed
and he took the whiskey He however wiped his lips with a slight wave
of his handkerchief to support a certain easy elegance which he firmly
believed relieved the act of any vulgar quality

Yes maam he continued after an exhilarated pause Ez I said
afore this yers a matter you and me can discuss after the fashion o
society My idea is that these yer boys should kinder let up on you and
Miss Jessie for a while and do a little more permiskus attention round
the Ford Theres one or two families yer with grownup gals ez oughter
be squared that isthe boys mighter put in a few fancy touches among
themkinder take em buggy ridingor to churchonce in a whilejust
to take the pizen outer their tongues and make a kind o bluff to the
parents dye see That would sorter divert their own minds and even if
it didnt it would kinder get em accustomed agin to the old style and
their own kind I want to warn ye agin an idea that might occur to you
in a giniral way I dont say you hev the idea but its kind o natral
you might be thinkin of it some time and I thought Id warn you agin
it

I think we understand each other too well to differ much Mr Hall
said Christie still smiling but what is the idea

The delicate compliment to their confidential relations and the slight
stimulus of liquor had tremulously exalted Whiskey Dick Affecting to
look cautiously out of the window and around the room he ventured
to draw nearer the young woman with a halfpaternal halftimid
familiarity

It might have occurred to you he said laying his handkerchief as if
to veil mere vulgar contact on Christies shoulder that it would be a
good thing on YOUR side to invite down some of your hightoned gentlemen
friends from Frisco to visit you and escort you round It seems quite
natral like and I dont say it aint butthe boys wouldnt stand for
it

In spite of her selfpossession Christies eyes suddenly darkened
and she involuntarily drew herself up But Whiskey Dick guiltily
attributing the movement to his own indiscreet gesture said Excuse
me miss recovered himself by lightly dusting her shoulder with his
handkerchief as if to remove the impression and her smile returned

They wouldnt stand for it said Dick and thered be some shooting
Not afore you missnot afore you in course But theyd adjourn to the
woods some morning with them city folks and hev it out with rifles at
a hundred yards Or seein ez theyre city folks the boys would do the
square thing with pistols at twelve paces Theyre good boys as I
said afore but theyre quick and tetchyGeorge being the youngest
natrally is the tetchiest You know how it is Miss Carr his pretty
gallike face and little moustaches haz cost him half a dozen scrimmages
already Hez had a fight for every hair thats growed in his moustache
since he kem here

Say no more Mr Hall said Christie rising and pressing her hands
lightly on Dicks tremulous fingers If I ever had any such idea I
should abandon it now you are quite right in this as in your other
opinions I shall never cease to be thankful to Mr Munroe and Mr
Kearney that they intrusted this delicate matter to your hands

Well said the gratified and reddening visitor it aint perhaps
the square thing to them or myself to say that they reckoned to have me
discuss their delicate affairs for them but

I understand interrupted Christie They simply gave you the letter
as a friend It was my good fortune to find you a sympathizing and
liberal man of the world The delighted Dick with conscious vanity
beaming from every feature of his shining face lightly waved the
compliment aside with his handkerchief as she continued But I am
forgetting the message We accept the horses Of course we COULD do
without an escort but forgive my speaking so frankly are YOU engaged
this afternoon

Excuse me miss I dont take stammered Dick scarcely believing his
ears

Could you give us your company as an escort repeated Christie with a
smile

Was he awake or dreaming or was this some trick of liquor in his
often distorted fancy He Whiskey Dick the butt of his friends the
chartered oracle of the barrooms even in whose wretched vanity there
was always the haunting suspicion that he was despised and scorned he
who had dared so much in speech and achieved so little in fact he
whose habitual weakness had even led him into the wildest indiscretion
here henow offered a reward for that indiscretion He Whiskey Dick
the solicited escort of these two beautiful and peerless girls What
would they say at the Ford What would his friends think It would be
all over the Ford the next day His past would be vindicated his future
secured He grew erect at the thought It was almost in other voice
and with no trace of his previous exaggeration that he said With
pleasure

Then if you will bring the horses at once we shall be ready when you
return

In another instant he had vanished as if afraid to trust the reality of
his good fortune to the dangers of delay At the end of half an hour
he reappeared leading the two horses himself mounted on a halfbroken
mustang A pair of large jingling silver spurs and a stiff sombrero
borrowed with the mustang from some mysterious source were donned to do
honor to the occasion

The young girls were not yet ready but he was shown by the Chinese
servant into the parlor to wait for them The decanter of whiskey and
glasses were still invitingly there He was hot trembling and flushed
with triumph He walked to the table and laid his hand on the decanter
when an odd thought flashed upon him He would not drink this time
No it should not be said that he the selected escort of the elite of
Devils Ford had to fill himself up with whiskey before they started
The boys might turn to each other in their astonishment as he proudly
passed with his fair companions and say Its Whiskey Dick but hed
be dd if they should add and full as ever No sir Nor when
he was riding beside these real ladies and leaning over them at some
confidential moment should they even know it from his breath No   
Yet a thimbleful taken straight only a thimbleful wouldnt be much
and might help to pull him together He again reached his trembling
hand for the decanter hesitated and then turning his back upon it
resolutely walked to the open window Almost at the same instant he
found himself face to face with Christie on the veranda

She looked into his bloodshot eyes and cast a swift glance at the
decanter

Wont you take something before you go she said sweetly

Ireckonnot jest now stammered Whiskey Dick with a heroic
effort

Youre right said Christie I see you are like me Its too hot for
anything fiery Come with me

She led him into the diningroom and pouring out a glass of iced
tea handed it to him Poor Dick was not prepared for this terrible
culmination Whiskey Dick and iced tea But under pretence of seeing if
it was properly flavored Christie raised it to her own lips

Try it to please me

He drained the goblet

Now then said Christie gayly lets find Jessie and be off




CHAPTER V


Whatever might have been his other deficiencies as an escort Whiskey
Dick was a good horseman and in spite of his fractious brute
exhibited such skill and confidence as to at once satisfy the young
girls of his value to them in the management of their own horses
to whom sidesaddles were still an alarming novelty Jessie who
had probably already learned from her sister the purport of Dicks
confidences had received him with equal cordiality and perhaps a more
unqualified amusement and now when fairly lifted into the saddle by
his tremulous but respectful hands made a very charming picture of
youthful and rosy satisfaction And when Christie more fascinating than
ever in her ridinghabit took her place on the other side of Dick as
they sallied from the gate that gentleman felt his cup of happiness
complete His triumphal entree into the world of civilization and
fashion was secure He did not regret the untasted liquor here was
an experience in after years to lean his back against comfortably in
barrooms to entrance or defy mankind He had even got so far as
to formulate in fancy the sentence I remember gentlemen that one
afternoon being on a pasear with two fashnable young ladies etc
etc

At present however he was obliged to confine himself to the functions
of an elegant guide and ciceronewhen not engaged in having it out
with his horse Their way lay along the slope crossing the highroad at
right angles to reach the deeper woods beyond Dick would have lingered
on the highwayostensibly to point out to his companions the new flume
that had taken the place of the condemned ditch but really in the hope
of exposing himself in his glory to the curious eyes of the wayfaring
world

Unhappily the road was deserted in the still powerful sunlight and he
was obliged to seek the cover of the woods with a passing compliment to
the parent of his charges Waving his hands towards the flume he
said Look at that work of your fathers there aint no other man in
Californy but Philip Carr ez would hev the grit to hold up such a bluff
agin natur and agin luck ez that yer flume stands for I dont say it
cause youre his daughters ladies That aint the style ez YOU know
in sassiety Miss Carr he added turning to Christie as the more
socially experienced No but there aint another man to be found
ez could do it It cost already two hundred thousand itll cost five
hundred thousand afore its done and every cent of it is got out of the
yearth beneath it or HEZ got to be out of it Taint evry man Miss
Carr ez hev got the pluck to pledge not only what hes got but what he
reckons to git

But suppose he dont get it said Christie slightly contracting her
brows

Then theres the flume to show for it said Dick

But of what use is the flume if there isnt any more gold continued
Christie almost angrily

Thats good from YOU miss said Dick giving way to a fit of
hilarity Thats good for a fashnable young ladyown daughter of
Philip Carr She sez says she continued Dick appealing to the sedate
pines for appreciation of Christies rare humor Wots the use of a
flume when gold aint there I must tell that to the boys

And whats the use of the gold in the ground when the flume isnt there
to work it out said Jessie to her sister with a cautioning glance
towards Dick

But Dick did not notice the look that passed between the sisters The
richer humor of Jessies retort had thrown him into convulsions of
laughter

And now SHE says wots the use o the gold without the flume Xcuse
me ladies but thats just puttin the hull question thats agitatin
this yer camp inter two speeches as clear as crystal Theres the
hull crowd outsideand some on em inside like Fairfax hez their
doubtsez says with Miss Christie and theres all of us inside ez
holds Miss Jessies views

I never heard Mr Munroe say that the flume was wrong said Jessie
quickly

Not to you natrally said Dick with a confidential look at
Christie but I reckon hed like some of the money it cost laid out for
suthin else But whats the odds The gold is there and WERE bound to
get it

Dick was the foreman of a gang of paid workmen who had replaced the
millionaires in mere manual labor and the WE was a polite figure of
speech

The conversation seemed to have taken an unfortunate turn and both the
girls experienced a feeling of relief when they entered the long gulch
or defile that led to Indian Spring The track now becoming narrow they
were obliged to pass in single file along the precipitous hillside
led by this escort This effectually precluded any further speech
and Christie at once surrendered herself to the calm obliterating
influences of the forest The settlement and its gossip were far behind
and forgotten In the absorption of nature her companions passed out of
her mind even as they sometimes passed out of her sight in the windings
of the shadowy trail As she rode alone the fronds of breasthigh
ferns seemed to caress her with outstretched and gentlydetaining hands
strange wildflowers sprang up through the parting underbrush even the
granite rocks that at times pressed closely upon the trail appeared as
if cushioned to her contact with starrayed mosses or lightly flung
after her long lassoes of delicate vines She recalled the absolute
freedom of their alfresco life in the old double cabin when she
spent the greater part of her waking hours under the mute trees in
the encompassing solitude and half regretting the more civilized
restraints of this newer and more ambitious abode forgot that she had
ever rebelled against it The social complication that threatened her
now seemed to her rather the outcome of her halfcivilized parlor than
of the sylvan glade How easy it would have been to have kept the cabin
and then to have gone away entirely than for her father to have allowed
them to be compromised with the growing fortunes of the settlement
The suspicions and distrust that she had always felt of their fortunes
seemed to grow with the involuntary admission of Whiskey Dick that
they were shared by others who were practical men She was fain to have
recourse to the prospect again to banish these thoughts and this opened
her eyes to the fact that her companions had been missing from the trail
ahead of her for some time She quickened her pace slightly to reach
a projecting point of rock that gave her a more extended prospect But
they had evidently disappeared

She was neither alarmed nor annoyed She could easily overtake them
soon for they would miss her and return or wait for her at the spring
At the worst she would have no difficulty in retracing her steps home
In her present mood she could readily spare their company indeed she
was not sorry that no other being should interrupt that sympathy with
the free woods which was beginning to possess her

She was destined however to be disappointed She had not proceeded a
hundred yards before she noticed the moving figure of a man beyond her
in the hillside chaparral above the trail He seemed to be going in the
same direction as herself and as she fancied endeavoring to avoid
her This excited her curiosity to the point of urging her horse forward
until the trail broadened into the level forest again which she now
remembered was a part of the environs of Indian Spring The stranger
hesitated pausing once or twice with his back towards her as if
engaged in carefully examining the dwarf willows to select a switch
Christie slightly checked her speed as she drew nearer when as if
obedient to a sudden resolution he turned and advanced towards her She
was relieved and yet surprised to recognize the boyish face and figure
of George Kearney He was quite pale and agitated although attempting
by a jaunty swinging of the switch he had just cut to assume the
appearance of ease and confidence

Here was an opportunity Christie resolved to profit by it She did not
doubt that the young fellow had already passed her sister on the trail
but from bashfulness had not dared to approach her By inviting his
confidence she would doubtless draw something from him that would deny
or corroborate her fathers opinion of his sentiments If he was really
in love with Jessie she would learn what reasons he had for expecting
a serious culmination of his suit and perhaps she might be able
delicately to open his eyes to the truth If as she believed it was
only a boyish fancy she would laugh him out of it with that camaraderie
which had always existed between them A half motherly sympathy albeit
born quite as much from a contemplation of his beautiful yearning eyes
as from his interesting position lightened the smile with which she
greeted him

So you contrived to throw over your stupid business and join us
after all she said or was it that you changed your mind at the
last moment she added mischievously I thought only we women were
permitted that Indeed she could not help noticing that there was
really a strong feminine suggestion in the shifting color and slightly
conscious eyelids of the young fellow

Do young girls always change their minds asked George with an
embarrassed smile

Not always but sometimes they dont know their own mindparticularly
if they are very young and when they do at last you clever creatures
of men who have interpreted their ignorance to please yourselves abuse
them for being fickle She stopped to observe the effect of what she
believed a rather clear and significant exposition of Jessies and
Georges possible situation But she was not prepared for the look
of blank resignation that seemed to drive the color from his face and
moisten the fire of his dark eyes

I reckon youre right he said looking down

Oh were not accusing you of fickleness said Christie gayly
although you didnt come and we were obliged to ask Mr Hall to join
us I suppose you found him and Jessie just now

But George made no reply The color was slowly coming back to his face
which as she glanced covertly at him seemed to have grown so much
older that his returning blood might have brought two or three years
with it

Really Mr Kearney she said dryly one would think that some silly
conceited girlshe was quite earnest in her epithets for a sudden
angry conviction of some coquetry and disingenuousness in Jessie had
come to her in contemplating its effects upon the young fellow at her
sidesome country jilt had been trying her rustic hand upon you

She is not silly conceited nor countrified said George slowly
raising his beautiful eyes to the young girl half reproachfully It is
I who am all that No she is right and you know it

Much as Christie admired and valued her sisters charms she thought
this was really going too far What had Jessie ever donewhat was
Jessieto provoke and remain insensible to such a blind devotion as
this And really looking at him now he was not so VERY YOUNG for
Jessie whether his unfortunate passion had brought out all his latent
manliness or whether he had hitherto kept his serious nature in the
background certainly he was not a boy And certainly his was not a
passion that he could be laughed out of It was getting very tiresome
She wished she had not met himat least until she had had some clearer
understanding with her sister He was still walking beside her with his
hand on her bridle rein partly to lead her horse over some boulders in
the trail and partly to conceal his first embarrassment When they had
fairly reached the woods he stopped

I am going to say goodby Miss Carr

Are you not coming further We must be near Indian Spring now Mr
Hall andand Jessiecannot be far away You will keep me company until
we meet them

No he replied quietly I only stopped you to say goodby I am going
away

Not from Devils Ford she asked in halfincredulous astonishment
At least not for long

I am not coming back he replied

But this is very abrupt she said hurriedly feeling that in some
ridiculous way she had precipitated an equally ridiculous catastrophe
Surely you are not going away in this fashion without saying goodby
to Jessie andand father

I shall see your father of courseand you will give my regards to
Miss Jessie

He evidently was in earnest Was there ever anything so perfectly
preposterous She became indignant

Of course she said coldly I wont detain you your business must
be urgent and I forgotat least I had forgotten until todaythat
you have other duties more important than that of squire of dames I am
afraid this forgetfulness made me think you would not part from us in
quite such a business fashion I presume if you had not met me just
now we should none of us have seen you again

He did not reply

Will you say goodby Miss Carr

He held out his hand

One moment Mr Kearney If I have said anything which you think
justifies this very abrupt leavetaking I beg you will forgive and
forget itor at least let it have no more weight with you than the
idle words of any woman I only spoke generally You knowII might be
mistaken

His eyes which had dilated when she began to speak darkened his
color which had quickly come as quickly sank when she had ended

Dont say that Miss Carr It is not like you andit is useless You
know what I meant a moment ago I read it in your reply You meant that
I like others had deceived myself Did you not

She could not meet those honest eyes with less than equal honesty
She knew that Jessie did not love himwould not marry himwhatever
coquetry she might have shown

I did not mean to offend you she said hesitatingly I only half
suspected it when I spoke

And you wish to spare me the avowal he said bitterly

To me perhaps yes by anticipating it I could not tell what ideas
you might have gathered from some indiscreet frankness of Jessieor my
father she added with almost equal bitterness

I have never spoken to either he replied quickly He stopped and
added after a moments mortifying reflection Ive been brought up in
the woods Miss Carr and I suppose I have followed my feelings instead
of the etiquette of society

Christie was too relieved at the rehabilitation of Jessies truthfulness
to notice the full significance of his speech

Goodby he said again holding out his hand

Goodby

She extended her own ungloved with a frank smile He held it for a
moment with his eyes fixed upon hers Then suddenly as if obeying
an uncontrollable impulse he crushed it like a flower again and again
against his burning lips and darted away

Christie sank back in her saddle with a little cry half of pain and
half of frightened surprise Had the poor boy suddenly gone mad or was
this vicarious farewell a part of the courtship of Devils Ford She
looked at her little hand which had reddened under the pressure and
suddenly felt the flush extending to her cheeks and the roots of her
hair This was intolerable

Christie

It was her sister emerging from the wood to seek her In another moment
she was at her side

We thought you were following said Jessie Good heavens how you
look What has happened

Nothing I met Mr Kearney a moment ago on the trail He is going away
andand She stopped furious and flushing

And said Jessie with a burst of merriment he told you at last he
loved you Oh Christie




CHAPTER VI


The abrupt departure of George Kearney from Devils Ford excited
but little interest in the community and was soon forgotten It was
generally attributed to differences between himself and his partners
on the question of further outlay of their earnings on mining
improvementshe and Philip Carr alone representing a sanguine minority
whose faith in the future of the mine accepted any risks It was alleged
by some that he had sold out to his brother it was believed by others
that he had simply gone to Sacramento to borrow money on his share
in order to continue the improvements on his own responsibility The
partners themselves were uncommunicative even Whiskey Dick who since
his remarkable social elevation had become less oracular much to his
own astonishment contributed nothing to the gossip except a suggestion
that as the fiery temper of George Kearney brooked no opposition
even from his brother it was better they should separate before the
estrangement became serious

Mr Carr did not disguise his annoyance at the loss of his young
disciple and firm ally But an unlucky allusion to his previous remarks
on Kearneys attentions to Jessie and a querulous regret that he had
permitted a disruption of their social intimacy brought such an ominous
and frigid opposition not only from Christie but even the frivolous
Jessie herself that Carr sank back in a crushed and terrified silence
I only meant to say he stammered after a pause in which he however
resumed his aggrieved manner that FAIRFAX seems to come here still
and HE is not such a particular friend of mine

But she isand has your interest entirely at heart said Jessie
stoutly and he only comes here to tell us how things are going on at
the works

And criticise your father I suppose said Mr Carr with an
attempt at jocularity that did not however disguise an irritated
suspiciousness He really seems to have supplanted ME as he has poor
Kearney in your estimation

Now father said Jessie suddenly seizing him by the shoulders in
affected indignation but really to conceal a certain embarrassment
that sprang quite as much from her sisters quietly observant eye as her
fathers speech you promised to let this ridiculous discussion drop
You will make me and Christie so nervous that we will not dare to
open the door to a visitor until he declares his innocence of any
matrimonial intentions You dont want to give color to the gossip that
agreement with your views about the improvements is necessary to getting
on with us

Who dares talk such rubbish said Carr reddening is that the kind
of gossip that Fairfax brings here

Hardly when its known that he dont quite agree with you and DOES
come here Thats the best denial of the gossip

Christie who had of late loftily ignored these discussions waited
until her father had taken his departure

Then that is the reason why you still see Mr Munroe after what you
said she remarked quietly to Jessie

Jessie who would have liked to escape with her father was obliged to
pause on the threshold of the door with a pretty assumption of blank
forgetfulness in her blue eyes and lifted eyebrows

Said what when she asked vacantly

Whenwhen Mr Kearney that dayin the woodswent away said
Christie faintly coloring

Oh THAT day said Jessie briskly the day he just gloved your
hand with kisses and then fled wildly into the forest to conceal his
emotion

The day he behaved very foolishly said Christie with reproachful
calmness that did not however prevent a suspicion of indignant
moisture in her eyeswhen you explained

That it wasnt meant for ME interrupted Jessie

That it was to you that MR MUNROES attentions were directed And then
we agreed that it was better to prevent any further advances of this
kind by avoiding any familiar relations with either of them

Yes said Jessie I remember but youre not confounding my seeing
Fairfax occasionally now with that sort of thing HE doesnt kiss my
hand like anything she added as if in abstract reflection

Nor run away either suggested the trodden worm turning

There was an ominous silence

Do you know we are nearly out of coffee said Jessie choking but
moving towards the door with Spartanlike calmness

Yes And something must be done this very day about the washing said
Christie with suppressed emotion going towards the opposite entrance

Tears stood in each others eyes with this terrible exchange of domestic
confidences Nevertheless after a moments pause they deliberately
turned again and facing each other with frightful calmness left
the room by purposeless and deliberate exits other than those they
had contemplateda crushing abnegation of self that to some extent
relieved their surcharged feelings

Meantime the material prosperity of Devils Ford increased if a
prosperity based upon no visible foundation but the confidences and
hopes of its inhabitants could be called material Few if any stopped
to consider that the improvements buildings and business were simply
the outlay of capital brought from elsewhere and as yet the settlement
or town as it was now called had neither produced nor exported capital
of itself equal to half the amount expended It was true that some
land was cultivated on the further slope some mills erected and lumber
furnished from the inexhaustible forest but the consumers were the
inhabitants themselves who paid for their produce in borrowed capital
or unlimited credit It was never discovered that while all roads led to
Devils Ford Devils Ford led to nowhere The difficulties overcome
in getting things into the settlement were never surmounted for getting
things out of it The lumber was practically valueless for export to
other settlements across the mountain roads which were equally rich in
timber The theory so enthusiastically held by the original locators
that Devils Ford was a vast sink that had through ages exhausted and
absorbed the trickling wealth of the adjacent hills and valleys was
suffering an ironical corroboration

One morning it was known that work was stopped at the Devils Ford
Ditchtemporarily only it was alleged and many of the old workmen
simply had their labor for the present transferred to excavating the
river banks and the collection of vast heaps of pay gravel Specimens
from these mounds taken from different localities and at different
levels were sent to San Francisco for more rigid assay and analysis
It was believed that this would establish the fact of the permanent
richness of the drifts and not only justify past expenditure but a
renewed outlay of credit and capital The suspension of engineering work
gave Mr Carr an opportunity to visit San Francisco on general business
of the mine which could not however prevent him from arranging
further combinations with capital His two daughters accompanied him It
offered an admirable opportunity for a shopping expedition a change of
scene and a peaceful solution of their perplexing and anomalous social
relations with Devils Ford In the first flush of gratitude to their
father for this opportune holiday something of harmony had been
restored to the family circle that had of late been shaken by discord

But their sanguine hopes of enjoyment were not entirely fulfilled Both
Jessie and Christie were obliged to confess to a certain disappointment
in the aspect of the civilization they were now reentering They at
first attributed it to the change in their own habits during the last
three months and their having become barbarous and countrified in
their seclusion Certainly in the matter of dress they were behind the
fashions as revealed in Montgomery Street But when the brief solace
afforded them by the modiste and dressmaker was past there seemed
little else to be gained They missed at first I fear the chivalrous
and loyal devotion that had only amused them at Devils Ford and were
the more inclined I think to distrust the conscious and more civilized
gallantry of the better dressed and more carefully presented men they
met For it must be admitted that for obvious reasons their criticisms
were at first confined to the sex they had been most in contact with
They could not help noticing that the men were more eager annoyingly
feverish and selfasserting in their superior elegance and external
show than their old associates were in their frank unrestrained habits
It seemed to them that the five millionaires of Devils Ford in their
radical simplicity and thoroughness were perhaps nearer the type of
true gentlemanhood than these citizens who imitated a civilization they
were unable yet to reach

The women simply frightened them as being even more than the men
demonstrative and excessive in their fine looks their fine dresses
their extravagant demand for excitement In less than a week they found
themselves regrettingnot the new villa on the slope of Devils Ford
which even in its own bizarre fashion was exceeded by the barbarous
ostentation of the villas and private houses around thembut the double
cabin under the trees which now seemed to them almost aristocratic in
its grave simplicity and abstention In the mysterious forests of masts
that thronged the citys quays they recalled the straight shafts of the
pines on Devils slopes only to miss the sedate repose and infinite
calm that used to environ them In the feverish pulsating life of the
young metropolis they often stopped oppressed giddy and choking the
roar of the streets and thoroughfares was meaningless to them except to
revive strange memories of the deep unvarying monotone of the evening
wind over their humbler roof on the Sierran hillside Civic bred and
nurtured as they were the recurrence of these sensations perplexed and
alarmed them

It seems so perfectly ridiculous said Jessie for us to feel as out
of place here as that Pike County servant girl in Sacramento who had
never seen a steamboat before do you know I quite had a turn the other
day at seeing a man on the Stockton wharf in a red shirt with a rifle
on his shoulder

And you wanted to go and speak to him said Christie with a sad
smile

No thats just it I felt awfully hurt and injured that he did not
come up and speak to ME I wonder if we got any fever or that sort of
thing up there it makes one quite superstitious

Christie did not reply more than once before she had felt that
inexplicable misgiving It had sometimes seemed to her that she had
never been quite herself since that memorable night when she had
slipped out of their sleepingcabin and stood alone in the gracious and
commanding presence of the woods and hills In the solitude of night
with the hum of the great city rising below herat times even in
theatres or crowded assemblies of men and womenshe forgot herself
and again stood in the weird brilliancy of that moonlight night in
mute worship at the foot of that slowlyrising mystic altar of piled
terraces hanging forests and lifted plateaus that climbed forever to
the lonely skies Again she felt before her the expanding and opening
arms of the protecting woods Had they really closed upon her in some
pantheistic embrace that made her a part of them Had she been baptized
in that moonlight as a child of the great forest It was easy to believe
in the myths of the poets of an idyllic life under those trees where
free from conventional restrictions one loved and was loved If she
with her own worldly experience could think of this now why might
not George Kearney have thought    She stopped and found herself
blushing even in the darkness As the thought and blush were the usual
sequel of her reflections it is to be feared that they may have been at
times the impelling cause

Mr Carr however made up for his daughters want of sympathy with
metropolitan life To their astonishment he not only plunged into the
fashionable gayeties and amusements of the town but in dress and manner
assumed the role of a leader of society The invariable answer to their
halfhumorous comment was the necessities of the mine and the policy
of frequenting the company of capitalists to enlist their support and
confidence There was something in this so unlike their father that
what at any other time they would have hailed as a relief to
his habitual abstraction now half alarmed them Yet he was not
dissipatedhe did not drink nor gamble There certainly did not seem
any harm in his frequenting the society of ladies with a gallantry that
appeared to be forced and a pleasure that to their critical eyes was
certainly apocryphal He did not drag his daughters into the mixed
society of that period he did not press upon them the company of those
he most frequented and whose accepted position in that little world of
fashion was considered equal to their own When Jessie strongly objected
to the pronounced manners of a certain widow whose actual present
wealth and pecuniary influence condoned for a more uncertain prehistoric
past Mr Carr did not urge a further acquaintance As long as youre
not thinking of marrying again papa Jessie had said finally I dont
see the necessity of our knowing her But suppose I were had replied
Mr Carr with affected humor Then you certainly wouldnt care for any
one like her his daughter had responded triumphantly Mr Carr smiled
and dropped the subject but it is probable that his daughters want of
sympathy with his acquaintances did not in the least interfere with
his social prestige A gentleman in all his relations and under all
circumstances even his cold scientific abstraction was provocative
rich men envied his lofty ignorance of the smaller details of
moneymaking even while they mistrusted his judgment A man still well
preserved and free from weakening vices he was a dangerous rival to
younger and faster San Francisco in the eyes of the sex who knew how
to value a repose they did not themselves possess

Suddenly Mr Carr announced his intention of proceeding to Sacramento
on further business of the mine leaving his two daughters in the family
of a wealthy friend until he should return for them He opposed their
ready suggestion to return to Devils Ford with a new and unnecessary
inflexibility he even met their compromise to accompany him to
Sacramento with equal decision

You will be only in my way he said curtly Enjoy yourselves here
while you can

Thus left to themselves they tried to accept his advice Possibly some
slight reaction to their previous disappointment may have already set
in perhaps they felt any distraction to be a relief to their anxiety
about their father They went out more they frequented concerts and
parties they accepted with their host and his family an invitation to
one of those opulent and barbaric entertainments with which a noted San
Francisco millionaire distracted his rare moments of reflection in his
gorgeous palace on the hills Here they could at least be once more in
the country they loved albeit of a milder and less heroic type and a
little degraded by the overlapping tinsel and scattered spangles of the
palace

It was a three days fete the style and choice of amusements left to
the guests and an equal and active participation by no means necessary
or indispensable Consequently when Christie and Jessie Carr proposed
a ride through the adjacent canyon on the second morning they had no
difficulty in finding horses in the wellfurnished stables of their
opulent entertainers nor cavaliers among the other guests who were
too happy to find favor in the eyes of the two pretty girls who were
supposed to be abnormally fastidious and refined Christies escort
was a goodnatured young banker shrewd enough to avoid demonstrative
attentions and lucky enough to interest her during the ride with his
clear and halfhumorous reflections on some of the business speculations
of the day If his ideas were occasionally too clever and not always
consistent with a high sense of honor she was none the less interested
to know the ethics of that world of speculation into which her father
had plunged and the more convinced with mingled sense of pride and
anxiety that his still dominant gentlemanhood would prevent his coping
with it on equal terms Nor could she help contrasting the conversation
of the sharpwitted man at her side with what she still remembered of
the vague touching boyish enthusiasm of the millionaires of Devils
Ford Had her escort guessed the result of this contrast he would
hardly have been as gratified as he was with the grave attention of her
beautiful eyes

The fascination of a gracious day and the leafy solitude of the canyon
led them to prolong their ride beyond the proposed limit and it became
necessary towards sunset for them to seek some shorter cut home

Theres a vaquero in yonder field said Christies escort who was
riding with her a little in advance of the others and those fellows
know every trail that a horse can follow Ill ride on intercept him
and try my Spanish on him If I miss him as hes galloping on you
might try your hand on him yourself Hell understand your eyes Miss
Carr in any language

As he dashed away to cover his first audacity of compliment Christie
lifted the eyes thus apostrophized to the opposite field The vaquero
who was chasing some cattle was evidently too preoccupied to heed the
shouts of her companion and wheeling round suddenly to intercept one
of the deviating fugitives permitted Christies escort to dash past him
before that gentleman could rein in his excited steed This brought the
vaquero directly in her path Perceiving her he threw his horse back on
its haunches to prevent a collision Christie rode up to him suddenly
uttered a cry and halted For before her sunburnt in cheek and throat
darker in the free growth of moustache and curling hair clad in the
coarse picturesque finery of his class undisguised only in his boyish
beauty sat George Kearney

The blood that had forsaken her astonished face rushed as quickly
back His eyes which had suddenly sparkled with an electrical glow
sank before hers His hand dropped and his cheek flushed with a dark
embarrassment

You here Mr Kearney How strangebut how glad I am to meet you
again

She tried to smile her voice trembled and her little hand shook as she
extended it to him

He raised his dark eyes quickly and impulsively urged his horse to her
side But as if suddenly awakening to the reality of the situation
he glanced at her hurriedly down at his barbaric finery and threw a
searching look towards her escort

In an instant Christie saw the infelicity of her position and its
dangers The words of Whiskey Dick He wouldnt stand that flashed
across her mind There was no time to lose The banker had already
gained control over his horse and was approaching them all unconscious
of the fixed stare with which George was regarding him Christie hastily
seized the hand which he had allowed to fall at his side and said
quickly

Will you ride with me a little way Mr Kearney

He turned the same searching look upon her She met it clearly and
steadily he even thought reproachfully

Do she said hurriedly I ask it as a favor I want to speak to you
Jessie and I are here alone Father is away YOU are one of our oldest
friends

He hesitated She turned to the astonished young banker who rode up

I have just met an old friend Will you please ride back as quickly as
you can and tell Jessie that Mr Kearney is here and ask her to join
us

She watched her dazed escort still speechless from the spectacle of the
fastidious Miss Carr teteatete with a common Mexican vaquero gallop
off in the direction of the canyon and then turned to George

Now take me home the shortest way as quick as you can

Home echoed George

I mean to Mr Princes house Quick before they can come up to us

He mechanically put spurs to his horse she followed They presently
struck into a trail that soon diverged again into a disused logging
track through the woods

This is the short cut to Princes by two miles he said as they
entered the woods

As they were still galloping without exchanging a word Christie began
to slacken her speed George did the same They were safe from intrusion
at the present even if the others had found the short cut Christie
bold and selfreliant a moment ago suddenly found herself growing weak
and embarrassed What had she done

She checked her horse suddenly

Perhaps we had better wait for them she said timidly

George had not raised his eyes to hers

You said you wanted to hurry home he replied gently passing his hand
along his mustangs velvety neck andand you had something to say to
me

Certainly she answered with a faint laugh Im so astonished at
meeting you here Im quite bewildered You are living here you have
forsaken us to buy a ranche she continued looking at him attentively

His brow colored slightly

No Im living here but I have bought no ranche Im only a hired man
on somebody elses ranche to look after the cattle

He saw her beautiful eyes fill with astonishment andsomething else
His brow cleared he went on with his old boyish laugh

No Miss Carr The fact is Im dead broke Ive lost everything since
I saw you last But as I know how to ride and Im not afraid of work I
manage to keep along

You have lost money inin the mines said Christie suddenly

Nohe replied quickly evading her eyes My brother has my interest
you know Ive been foolish on my own account solely You know Im
rather inclined to that sort of thing But as long as my folly dont
affect others I can stand it

But it may affect othersand THEY may not think of it as folly She
stopped short confused by his brightening color and eyes I meanOh
Mr Kearney I want you to be frank with me I know nothing of business
but I know there has been trouble about the mine at Devils Ford Tell
me honestly has my father anything to do with it If I thought that
through any imprudence of his you had sufferedif I believed that
you could trace any misfortune of yours to himto USI should never
forgive myselfshe stopped and flashed a single look at himI should
never forgive YOU for abandoning us

The look of pain which had at first shown itself in his face which
never concealed anything passed and a quick smile followed her
feminine anticlimax

Miss Carr he said with boyish eagerness if any man suggested to me
that your father wasnt the brightest and best of his kindtoo wise and
clever for the fools about him to understandIdId shoot him

Confused by his ready and gracious disclaimer of what she had NOT
intended to say there was nothing left for her but to rush upon
what she really intended to say with what she felt was shameful
precipitation

One word more Mr Kearney she began looking down but feeling the
color come to her face as she spoke When you spoke to me the day you
left you must have thought me hard and cruel When I tell you that I
thought you were alluding to Jessie and some feeling you had for her

For Jessie echoed George

You will understand thatthat

That what said George drawing nearer to her

That I was only speaking as she might have spoken had you talked to her
of me added Christie hurriedly slightly backing her horse away from
him

But this was not so easy as George was the better rider and by an
imperceptible movement of his wrist and foot had glued his horse to her
side He will go now she had thought but he didnt

We must ride on she suggested faintly

No he said with a sudden dropping of his boyish manner and a slight
lifting of his head We must ride together no further Miss Carr I
must go back to the work I am hired to do and you must go on with
your party whom I hear coming But when we part here you must bid me
goodbynot as Jessies sisterbut as Christiethe onethe only
woman that I love or that I ever have loved

He held out his hand With the recollection of their previous parting
she tremblingly advanced her own He took it but did not raise it to
his lips And it was she who found herself half confusedly retaining his
hand in hers until she dropped it with a blush

Then is this the reason you give for deserting us as you have deserted
Devils Ford she said coldly

He lifted his eyes to her with a strange smile and said Yes wheeled
his horse and disappeared in the forest

He had left her thus abruptly once before kissed blushing and
indignant He was leaving her now unkissed but white and indignant
Yet she was so selfpossessed when the party joined her that the
singular rencontre and her explanation of the strangers sudden
departure excited no further comment Only Jessie managed to whisper in
her ear

I hope you are satisfied now that it wasnt me he meant

Not at all said Christie coldly




CHAPTER VII


A few days after the girls had returned to San Francisco they received
a letter from their father His business he wrote would detain him in
Sacramento some days longer There was no reason why they should return
to Devils Ford in the heat of the summer their host had written to
beg him to allow them a more extended visit and if they were enjoying
themselves he thought it would be well not to disoblige an old friend
He had heard they had a pleasant visit to Mr Princes place and that a
certain young banker had been very attentive to Christie

Do you know what all this means dear asked Jessie who had been
watching her sister with an unusually grave face

Christie whose thoughts had wandered from the letter replied
carelessly

I suppose it means that we are to wait here until father sends for us

It means a good deal more It means that papa has had another reverse
it means that the assay has turned out badly for the minethat the
further they go from the flat the worse it getsthat all the gold they
will probably ever see at Devils Ford is what they have already found
or will find on the flat it means that all Devils Ford is only a
pocket and not a lead She stopped with unexpected tears in her
eyes

Who told you this asked Christie breathlessly

FairfaxMr Munroe stammered her sister writes to me as if we
already knew ittells me not to be alarmed that it isnt so badand
all that

How long has this happened Jessie said Christie taking her hand
with a white but calm face

Nearly ever since weve been here I suppose It must be so for he
says poor papa is still hopeful of doing something yet

And Mr Munroe writes to you said Christie abstractedly

Of course said Jessie quickly He feels interested inus

Nobody tells ME anything said Christie

Didnt

No said Christie bitterly

What on earth DID you talk about But people dont confide in you
because theyre afraid of you Youre so

So what

So gently patronizing and so Idontsupposeyoucanhelpit
poorthing in your general style said Jessie kissing her There
I only wish I was like you What do you say if we write to father that
well go back to Devils Ford Mr Munroe thinks we will be of service
there just now If the men are dissatisfied and think were spending
money

Im afraid Mr Munroe is hardly a disinterested adviser At least I
dont think it would look quite decent for you to fly back without your
father at his suggestion said Christie coldly He is not the only
partner We are spending no money Besides we have engaged to go to Mr
Princes again next week

As you like dear said Jessie turning away to hide a faint smile

Nevertheless when they returned from their visit to Mr Princes and
one or two uneventful rides Christie looked grave It was only a few
days later that Jessie burst upon her one morning

You were saying that nobody ever tells you anything Well heres your
chance Whiskey Dick is below

Whiskey Dick repeated Christie What does he want

YOU love Who else You know he always scorns me as not being
hightoned and elegant enough for his social confidences He asked for
you only

With an uneasy sense of some impending revelation Christie descended to
the drawingroom As she opened the door a strong flavor of that toilet
soap and eau de Cologne with which Whiskey Dick was in the habit of
gracefully effacing the traces of dissipation made known his presence
In spite of a new suit of clothes whose pristine folds refused to
adapt themselves entirely to the contour of his figure he was somewhat
subdued by the unexpected elegance of the drawingroom of Christies
host But a glance at Christies sad but gracious face quickly reassured
him Taking from his hat a threecornered parcel he unfolded a
handsome saffrona rose which he gravely presented to her Having
thus reestablished his position he sank elegantly into a teteatete
ottoman Finding the position inconvenient to face Christie who had
seated herself on a chair he transferred himself to the other side of
the ottoman and addressed her over its back as from a pulpit

Is this really a fortunate accident Mr Hall or did you try to find
us said Christie pleasantly

Partly promiskuss and partly coincident Miss Christie one up and
tother down said Dick lightly Work being slack at present at
Devils Ford I reckned Id take a pasear down to Frisco and dip into
the vortex o fashnable society and out again He lightly waved a
new handkerchief to illustrate his swallowlike intrusion This yer
minglin with the botong is apt to be wearisome ez you and me knows
unless combined with experience and judgment So when them boys up
there allows that theres a little too much fashnable society and San
Francisco capital and highfalutin about the future goin on fer square
surface mining I sez Look yere gentlemen sez I you dont see the
pint The pint is to get the poplar eye fixed so to speak on Devils
Ford When a fashnable star rises above the Frisco horizonlike Miss
Carrand so to speak dazzles the gineral eye people want to know
who she is And when people say thats the accomplished daughter o the
accomplished superintendent of the Devils Ford claimotherwise known
as the Stareyed Goddess o Devils Fordevery eye is fixed on the
mine and Capital so to speak tumbles to her And when they sez that
the old manexcuse my freedom but thats the way the boys talk of your
father meaning no harmthe old man instead o trying to corral rich
widdersgrass or otherwiseto spend their money on the big works for
the gold that aint there yetshould stay in Devils Ford and put all
his sabe and genius into grindin out the little gold that is there I
sez to them that it aint your fathers style His style sez I ez
to go in and build them works When theyre done he turns round to
Capital and sez heLook yer sez he thars all the works you
want first qualitycost a million thars all the water you want
onlimitedcost another million thars all the pay gravel you want
in and outer the groundcall it two millions more Now my times too
vallyble my professhuns too hightoned to WORK mines I MAKE em
Hand me over a check for ten millions and call it square and work it
for yourself So Capital hands over the money and waltzes down to run
the mine and you original locators walks round with yer hands in yer
pockets atop of your six million profit and you lets Capital take the
work and the responsibility

Preposterous as this seemed from the lips of Whiskey Dick Christie
had a haunting suspicion that it was not greatly unlike the theories
expounded by the clever young banker who had been her escort She did
not interrupt his flow of reminiscent criticism when he paused for
breath she said quietly

I met Mr George Kearney the other day in the country

Whiskey Dick stopped awkwardly glanced hurriedly at Christie and
coughed behind his handkerchief

Mr Kearneyehercertenglyyesermet him you say Was
heererwell

In health yes but otherwise he has lost everything said Christie
fixing her eyes on the embarrassed Dick

Yeserin coursein course continued Dick nervously glancing
round the apartment as if endeavoring to find an opening to some less
abrupt statement of the fact

And actually reduced to take some menial employment added Christie
still regarding Dick with her clear glance

Thats itthats just it said Dick beaming as he suddenly found his
delicate and confidential opportunity Thats it Miss Christie thats
just what I was sayin to the boys Ez it the square thing sez I
jest because George hez happened to hypothecate every dollar he has
or expects to hev to put into them works only to please Mr Carr and
just because he dont want to distress that intelligent gentleman by
letting him see hes dead brokefor him to go and demean himself and
Devils Ford by rushing away and hiring out as a Mexican vaquero
on Mexican wages Look sez I at the disgrace he brings upon a
hightoned fashnable girl at whose side hes walked and danced and
passed rings and sentiments and bokays in the changes o the cotillion
and the mizzourka And wot sez I if some day prancing along in a
fashnable cavalcade she all of a suddents comes across him drivin a
Mexican steer Thats what I said to the boys And so you met him Miss
Christie as usual continued Dick endeavoring under the appearance
of a large social experience to conceal an eager anxiety to know the
detailsso you met him and in course you didnt let on yer knew
him so to speak natrally or praps you kinder like asked him to fix
your saddlegirth and give him a fivedollar pieceeh

Christie who had risen and gone to the window suddenly turned a very
pale face and shining eyes on Dick

Mr Hall she said with a faint attempt at a smile we are old
friends and I feel I can ask you a favor You once before acted as our
escortit was for a short but a happy timewill you accept a larger
trust My father is busy in Sacramento for the mine will you without
saying anything to anybody take Jessie and me back at once to Devils
Ford

Will I Miss Christie said Dick choking between an intense
gratification and a desire to keep back its vulgar exhibition I shall
be proud

When I say keep it a secretshe hesitatedI dont mean that I
object to your letting Mr Kearney if you happen to know where he is
understand that we are going back to Devils Ford

Certnlynatrally said Dick waving his hand gracefully
sorter drop him a line saying that bizness of a social and delicate
naturebeing the escort of Miss Christie and Jessie Carr to Devils
Fordprevents my having the pleasure of calling

That will do very well Mr Hall said Christie faintly smiling
through her moist eyelashes Then will you go at once and secure
tickets for tonights boat and bring them here Jessie and I will
arrange everything else

Certnly said Dick impulsively and preparing to take a graceful
leave

Well be impatient until you return with the tickets said Christie
graciously

Dick shook hands gravely got as far as the door and paused

You think it better to take the tickets now he said dubiously

By all means said Christie impetuously Ive set my heart on going
tonightand unless you secure berths early

In coursein course interrupted Dick nervously But

But what said Christie impatiently

Dick hesitated shut the door carefully and looking round the
room lightly shook out his handkerchief apparently flicked away an
embarrassing suggestion and said with a little laugh

Its ridiklous perfectly ridiklous Miss Christie but not bein in
the habit of carryin ready money and havin omitted to cash a draft on
Wells Fargo  Co

Of course said Christie rapidly How forgetful I am Pray forgive
me Mr Hall I didnt think Ill run up and get it from our host he
will be glad to be our banker

One moment Miss Christie said Dick lightly as his thumb and finger
relaxed in his waistcoat pocket over the only piece of money in the
world that had remained to him after his extravagant purchase of
Christies saffrona rose one moment in this yer monetary transaction
if you like you are at liberty to use MY name




CHAPTER VIII


As Christie and Jessie Carr looked from the windows of the coach whose
dustclogged wheels were slowly dragging them as if reluctant nearer
the last stage of their journey to Devils Ford they were conscious
of a change in the landscape which they could not entirely charge upon
their changed feelings The few bared open spaces on the upland the
long stretch of rocky ridge near the summit so vivid and so velvety
during their first journey were now burnt and yellow even the brief
openings in the forest were seared as if by a hot iron in the scorching
rays of a half years sun The pastoral slopes of the valley below were
cloaked in lustreleather the rare watercourses along the road had
faded from the waiting eye and ear it seemed as if the long and dry
summer had even invaded the closeset ranks of pines and had blown a
simoom breath through the densest woods leaving its charred red ashes
on every leaf and spray along the tunnelled shade As they leaned out
of the window and inhaled the halfdead spices of the evergreens they
seemed to have entered the atmosphere of some exhausted passionof some
fierce excitement that was even now slowly burning itself out

It was a relief at last to see the straggling houses of Devils Ford far
below come once more into view as they rounded the shoulder of Devils
Spur and began the long descent But as they entered the town a change
more ominous and startling than the desiccation of the landscape
forced itself upon them The town was still there but where were
the inhabitants Four months ago they had left the straggling street
thronged with busy citizensgroups at every corner and a chaos
of merchandise and traders in the open plaza or square beside the
Presbyterian church Now all was changed Only a few wayfarers lifted
their heads lazily as the coach rattled by crossing the deserted square
littered with empty boxes and gliding past empty cabins or vacant shop
windows from which not only familiar faces but even the window sashes
themselves were gone The great unfinished serpentlike flume crossing
the river on gigantic trestles had advanced as far as the town
stooping over it like some enormous reptile that had sucked its life
blood and was gorged with its prey

Whiskey Dick who had left the stage on the summit to avail himself of
a shorter foot trail to the house that would give him half an hours
grace to make preparations met them at the stage office with a buggy
A glance at the young girls perhaps convinced him that the graces of
elegant worldly conversation were out of place with the revelation he
read on their faces Perhaps he too was a trifle indisposed The
short journey to the house was made in profound silence

The villa had been repainted and decorated and it looked fresher and
even to their preoccupied minds appeared more attractive than ever
Thoughtful hands had taken care of the vines and rosebushes on the
trellises waterthat precious element in Devils Fordhad not been
spared in keeping green through the long drought the plants which the
girls had so tenderly nurtured It was the one oasis in which the summer
still lingered and yet a singular sense of loss came over the girls as
they once more crossed its threshold It seemed no longer their own

Ef I was you Miss Christie Id keep close to the house for a day or
two untiluntilthings is settled said Dick theres a heap o
tramps and sich cattle trapsin round Praps you wouldnt feel so
lonesome if you was nearer townfor instance bout wher you useter
live

In the dear old cabin said Christie quickly I remember it I wish
we were there now

Do you really Do you said Whiskey Dick with suddenly twinkling
eyes Thats like you to say it Thats what I allus said continued
Dick addressing space generally if theres any one ez knows how
to come square down to the bottom rock without flinchin its your
hightoned fashnable gals But I must meander back to town and let
the boys know youre in possession safe and sound Its right mean that
Fairfax and Mattingly had to go down to Lagrange on some low business
yesterday but theyll be back tomorrow So long

Left alone the girls began to realize their strange position They had
conceived no settled plan The night they left San Francisco they had
written an earnest letter to their father telling him that on learning
the truth about the reverses of Devils Ford they thought it their duty
to return and share them with others without obliging him to prefer the
request and with as little worry to him as possible He would find them
ready to share his trials and in what must be the scene of their work
hereafter

It will bring father back said Christie he wont leave us here
alone and then together we must come to some understanding with
himwith THEMfor somehow I feel as if this house belonged to us no
longer

Her surmise was not far wrong When Mr Carr arrived hurriedly from
Sacramento the next evening he found the house deserted His daughters
were gone there were indications that they had arrived and for some
reason suddenly departed The vague fear that had haunted his guilty
soul after receiving their letter and during his breathless journey
now seemed to be realized He was turning from the empty house whose
reproachful solitude frightened him when he was confronted on the
threshold by the figure of Fairfax Munroe

I came to the stage office to meet you he said you must have left
the stage at the summit

I did said Carr angrily I was anxious to meet my daughters quickly
to know the reason of their foolish alarm and to know also who had been
frightening them Where are they

They are safe in the old cabin beyond that has been put up ready to
receive them again said Fairfax quietly

But what is the meaning of this Why are they not here demanded Carr
hiding his agitation in a burst of querulous rage

Do YOU ask Mr Carr said Fairfax sadly Did you expect them to
remain here until the sheriff took possession No one knows better than
yourself that the money advanced you on the deeds of this homestead has
never been repaid

Carr staggered but recovered himself with feeble violence

Since you know so much of my affairs how do you know that this claim
will ever be pressed for payment How do you know it is not the advance
of aafriend

Because I have seen the woman who advanced it said Fairfax
hopelessly She was here to look at the property before your daughters
came

Well said Carr nervously

Well You force me to tell you something I should like to forget You
force me to anticipate a disclosure I expected to make to you only when
I came to ask permission to woo your daughter Jessie and when I tell
you what it is you will understand that I have no right to criticise
your conduct I am only explaining my own

Go on said Carr impatiently

When I first came to this country there was a woman I loved
passionately She treated me as women of her kind only treat men like
me she ruined me and left me That was four years ago I love your
daughter Mr Carr but she has never heard it from my lips I would not
woo her until I had told you all I have tried to do it ere this and
failed Perhaps I should not now but

But what said Carr furiously speak out

But this Look said Fairfax producing from his pocket the packet of
letters Jessie had found perhaps you know the handwriting

What do you mean gasped Carr

That womanmy mistressis the woman who advanced you money and who
claims this house


The interview and whatever came of it remained a secret with the two
men When Mr Carr accepted the hospitality of the old cabin again it
was understood that he had sacrificed the new house and its furniture
to some of the more pressing debts of the mine and the act went far to
restore his waning popularity But a more genuine feeling of relief was
experienced by Devils Ford when it was rumored that Fairfax Munroe had
asked for the hand of Jessie Carr and that some promise contingent upon
the equitable adjustment of the affairs of the mine had been given
by Mr Carr To the superstitious mind of Devils Ford and its few
remaining locators this new partnership seemed to promise that unity
of interest and stability of fortune that Devils Ford had lacked But
nothing could be done until the rainy season had fairly set in until
the longlookedfor element that was to magically separate the gold from
the dross in those dull mounds of dust and gravel had come of its own
free will and in its own appointed channels independent of the feeble
auxiliaries that had hopelessly riven the rocks on the hillside or hung
incomplete and unfinished in lofty scaffoldings above the settlement

The rainy season came early At first in gathered mists on the higher
peaks that were lifted in the morning sun only to show a fresher field
of dazzling white below in white clouds that at first seemed to be mere
drifts blown across from those fresh snowfields and obscuring the
clear blue above in faroff murmurs in the hollow hills and gulches
in nearer tinkling melody and baby prattling in the leaves It came
with bright flashes of sunlight by day with deep monotonous shadow at
night with the onset of heavy winds the roar of turbulent woods
the tumultuous tossing of leafy arms and with what seemed the silent
dissolution of the whole landscape in days of steady and uninterrupted
downfall It came extravagantly for every canyon had grown into a
torrent every gulch a waterspout every watercourse a river and all
pouring into the North Fork that rushing past the settlement seemed
to threaten it with lifted crest and flying mane It came dangerously
for one night the river leaping the feeble barrier of Devils Ford
swept away houses and banks scattered with unconscious irony the
laboriously collected heaps of gravel left for hydraulic machinery and
spread out a vast and silent lake across the submerged flat

In the hurry and confusion of that night the girls had thrown open their
cabin to the escaping miners who hurried along the slope that was now
the bank of the river Suddenly Christie felt her arm grasped and she
was halfled halfdragged into the inner room Her father stood before
her

Where is George Kearney he asked tremulously

George Kearney echoed Christie for a moment believing the excitement
had turned her fathers brain You know he is not here he is in San
Francisco

He is hereI tell you said Carr impatiently he has been here ever
since the high water trying to save the flume and reservoir

Georgehere Christie could only gasp

Yes He passed here a few moments ago to see if you were all safe
and he has gone on towards the flume But what he is trying to do is
madness If you see him implore him to do no more Let him abandon the
accursed flume to its fate It has worked already too much woe upon us
all why should it carry his brave and youthful soul down with it

The words were still ringing in her ears when he suddenly passed away
with the hurrying crowd Scarcely knowing what she did she ran out
vaguely intent only on one thought seeking only the one face lately
so dear in recollection that she felt she would die if she never saw it
again Perplexed by confused voices in the woods she lost track of
the crowd until the voices suddenly were raised in one loud outcry
followed by the crashing of timber the splashing of water a silence
and then a dull continuous roar She ran vaguely on in the direction of
the reservoir with her fathers injunction still in her mind until a
terrible idea displaced it and she turned at right angles suddenly and
ran towards the slope leading down to the submerged flat She had barely
left the shelter of the trees behind her before the roar of water
seemed to rise at her very feet She stopped dazed bewildered and
horrorstricken on the edge of the slope It was the slope no longer
but the bank of the river itself

Even in the gray light of early morning and with inexperienced eyes
she saw all too clearly now The trestlework had given way the curving
mile of flume fallen into the stream and crushed and dammed against
the opposite shore had absolutely turned the whole river through the
halffinished ditch and partly excavated mine in its way a few rods
further on to join the old familiar channel The bank of the river was
changed the flat had become an island between which and the slope
where she stood the North Fork was rolling its resistless yellow
torrent As she gazed spellbound a portion of the slope beneath her
suddenly seemed to sink and crumble and was swallowed up in the rushing
stream She heard a cry of warning behind her but rooted to the spot
by a fearful fascination she heeded it not

Again there was a sudden disruption and another part of the slope sank
to rise no more but this time she felt herself seized by the waist and
dragged back It was her father standing by her side

He was flushed and excited gazing at the water with a strange
exultation

Do you see it Do you know what has happened he asked quickly

The flume has fallen and turned the river said Christie hurriedly
Buthave you seen himis he safe

Hewho he answered vacantly

George Kearney

He is safe he said impatiently But do you see Christie Do you
know what this means

He pointed with his tremulous hand to the stream before them

It means we are ruined said Christie coldly

Nothing of the kind It means that the river is doing the work of the
flume It is sluicing off the gravel deepening the ditch and altering
the slope which was the old bend of the river It will do in ten minutes
the work that would take us a year If we can stop it in time or
control it we are safe but if we can not it will carry away the bed
and deposit with the rest and we are ruined again

With a gesture of impotent fury he dashed away in the direction of an
equally excited crowd that on a point of the slope nearer the island
were gesticulating and shouting to a second group of men who on the
opposite shore were clambering on over the choked debris of the flume
that had dammed and diverted the current It was evident that the same
idea had occurred to them and they were risking their lives in the
attempt to set free the impediments Shocked and indignant as Christie
had been at the degrading absorption of material interests at such
a moment the element of danger lifted the labors of these men into
heroism and she began to feel a strange exultation as she watched them
Under the skilful blows of their axes in a few moments the vast body
of drift began to disintegrate and then to swing round and move towards
the old channel A cheer went up but as suddenly died away again An
overlapping fringe of wreckage had caught on the point of the island and
arrested the whole mass

The men who had gained the shore with difficulty looked back with a
cry of despair But the next moment from among them leaped a figure
alert buoyant invincible and axe in hand once more essayed the
passage Springing from timber to timber he at last reached the point
of obstruction A few strokes of the axe were sufficient to clear it
but at the first stroke it was apparent that the striker was also losing
his hold upon the shore and that he must inevitably be carried away
with the tossing debris But this consideration did not seem to affect
him the last blow was struck and as the freed timbers rolled on
over and over he boldly plunged into the flood Christie gave a little
cryher heart had bounded with him it seemed as if his plunge had
splashed the water in her eyes He did not come to the surface until he
had passed the point below where her father stood and then struggling
feebly as if stunned or disabled by a blow It seemed to her that he
was trying to approach the side of the river where she was Would he do
it Could she help him She was alone he was hidden from the view of
the men on the point and no succor could come from them There was a
fringe of alder nearly opposite their cabin that almost overhung the
stream She ran to it clutched it with a frantic hand and leaning
over the boiling water uttered for the first time his name

George

As if called to the surface by the magic of her voice he rose a few
yards from her in midcurrent and turned his fading eyes towards the
bank In another moment he would have been swept beyond her reach but
with a supreme effort he turned on one side the current striking him
sideways threw him towards the bank and she caught him by his sleeve
For an instant it seemed as if she would be dragged down with him For
one dangerous moment she did not care and almost yielded to the spell
but as the rush of water pressed him against the bank she recovered
herself and managed to lift him beyond its reach And then she sat
down halffainting with his white face and damp curls upon her breast

George darling speak to me Only one word Tell me have I saved
you

His eyes opened A faint twinkle of the old days came to thema boyish
smile played upon his lips

For yourselfor Jessie

She looked around her with a little frightened air They were alone
There was but one way of sealing those mischievous lips and she found
it


Thats what I allus said gentlemen lazily remarked Whiskey Dick
a few weeks later leaning back against the bar with his glass in
his hand George sez I it aint what you SAY to a fashnable
hightoned young lady its what you DOES ez makes or breaks you And
thats what I sez ginrally o things in the Ford It aint what Carr
and you boys allows to do its the ginral average o things ez IS done
that gives tone to the hull and hez brought this yer new luck to you
all
