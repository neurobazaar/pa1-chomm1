AN HABITATION ENFORCED

 My friend if cause doth wrest thee
 Ere folly hath much oppressed thee
 Far from acquaintance kest thee
 Where country may digest thee
 Thank God that so hath blessed thee
 And sit down Robin and rest thee
 THOMAS TUSSER

It came without warning at the very hour his hand was outstretched to
crumple the Holz and Gunsberg Combine The New York doctors called it
overwork and he lay in a darkened room one ankle crossed above
the other tongue pressed into palate wondering whether the next
brainsurge of prickly fires would drive his soul from all anchorages
At last they gave judgment With care he might in two years return to
the arena but for the present he must go across the water and do no
work whatever He accepted the terms It was capitulation but the
Combine that had shivered beneath his knife gave him all the honours
of war Gunsberg himself full of condolences came to the steamer and
filled the Chapins suite of cabins with overwhelming flowerworks

Smilax said George Chapin when he saw them Fitz is right Im dead
only I dont see why he left out the In Memoriam on the ribbons

Nonsense his wife answered and poured him his tincture Youll be
back before you can think

He looked at himself in the mirror surprised that his face had not been
branded by the hells of the past three months The noise of the decks
worried him and he lay down his tongue only a little pressed against
his palate

An hour later he said Sophie I feel sorry about taking you away from
everything like this II suppose were the two loneliest people on
Gods earth tonight

Said Sophie his wife and kissed him Isnt it something to you that
were going together

They drifted about Europe for monthssometimes alone sometimes with
chance met gipsies of their own land From the North Cape to the Blue
Grotto at Capri they wandered because the next steamer headed that way
or because some one had set them on the road The doctors had warned
Sophie that Chapin was not to take interest even in other mens
interests but a familiar sensation at the back of the neck after one
hours keen talk with a Nauheimed railway magnate saved her any trouble
He nearly wept

And Im over thirty he cried With all I meant to do

Lets call it a honeymoon said Sophie D you know in all the six
years weve been married youve never told me what you meant to do with
your life

With my life Whats the use Its finished now Sophie looked up
quickly from the Bay of Naples As far as my business goes I shall
have to live on my rents like that architect at San Moritz

Youll get better if you dont worry and even if it rakes time there
are worse things thanHow much have you

Between four and five million But it isnt the money You know it
isnt Its the principle How could you respect me You never did the
first year after we married till I went to work like the others Our
tradition and upbringing are against it We cant accept those ideals

Well I suppose I married you for some sort of ideal she answered
and they returned to their fortythird hotel

In England they missed the alien tongues of Continental streets that
reminded them of their own polyglot cities In England all men spoke one
tongue speciously like American to the ear but on crossexamination
unintelligible

Ah but you have not seen England said a lady with irongrey hair
They had met her in Vienna Bayreuth and Florence and were grateful
to find her again at Claridges for she commanded situations and knew
where prescriptions are most carefully made up You ought to take an
interest in the home of our ancestors as I do

Ive tried for a week Mrs Shonts said Sophie but I never get any
further than tipping German waiters

These men are not the true type Mrs Shouts went on I know where
you should go

Chapin pricked up his ears anxious to run anywhere from the streets
on which quick men something of his kidney did the business denied to
him

We hear and we obey Mrs Shonts said Sophie feeling his unrest as
he drank the loathed British tea

Mrs Shonts smiled and took them in hand She wrote widely and
telegraphed far on their behalf till armed with her letter of
introduction she drove them into that wilderness which is reached from
an ashbarrel of a station called Charing Cross They were to go to
Rockettsthe farm of one Cloke in the southern countieswhere she
assured them they would meet the genuine England of folklore and song

Rocketts they found after some hours four miles from a station and
so far as they could judge in the bumpy darkness twice as many from a
road Trees kine and the outlines of barns showed shadowy about them
when they alighted and Mr and Mrs Cloke at the open door of a deep
stonefloored kitchen made them shyly welcome They lay in an attic
beneath a wavy whitewashed ceiling and because it rained a wood fire
was made in an iron basket on a brick hearth and they fell asleep to
the chirping of mice and the whimper of flames

When they woke it was a fair day full of the noises of birds the
smell of box lavender and fried bacon mixed with an elemental smell
they had never met before

This said Sophie nearly pushing out the thin casement in an attempt
to see round the corner iswhat did the hackcabman say to the
railway porter about my trunkquite on the top

No a little bit of all right I feel farther away from anywhere than
Ive ever felt in my life We must find out where the telegraph office
is

Who cares said Sophie wandering about hairbrush in hand to admire
the illustrated weekly pictures pasted on door and cupboard

But there was no rest for the alien soul till he had made sure of the
telegraph office He asked the Clokes daughter laying breakfast while
Sophie plunged her face in the lavender bush outside the low window

Go to the stile atop o the Barn field said Mary and look across
Pardons to the next spire Its directly under You cant miss itnot
if you keep to the footpath My sisters the telegraphist there
But youre in the threemile radius sir The boy delivers telegrams
directly to this door from Pardons village

One has to take a good deal on trust in this country he murmured

Sophie looked at the close turf scarred only with last nights wheels
at two ruts which wound round a rickyard and at the circle of still
orchard about the halftimbered house

Whats the matter with it she said Telegrams delivered to the Vale
of Avalon of course and she beckoned in an earnesteyed hound of
engaging manners and no engagements who answered at times to the name
of Rambler He led them after breakfast to the rise behind the house
where the stile stood against the skyline and I wonder what we shall
find now said Sophie frankly prancing with joy on the grass

It was a slope of gaphedged fields possessed to their centres by clumps
of brambles Gates were not and the rabbitmined cattlerubbed posts
leaned out and in A narrow path doubled among the bushes scores of
white tails twinkled before the racing hound and a hawk rose whistling
shrilly

No roads no nothing said Sophie her short skirt hooked by briers
I thought all England was a garden Theres your spire George across
the valley How curious

They walked toward it through an all abandoned land Here they found
the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die there a harsh
fallow surrendered to yardhigh thistles and here a breadth of rampant
kelk feigning to be lawful crop In the ungrazed pastures swaths of dead
stuff caught their feet and the ground beneath glistened with sweat At
the bottom of the valley a little brook had undermined its footbridge
and frothed in the wreckage But there stood great woods on the slopes
beyondold tall and brilliant like unfaded tapestries against the
walls of a ruined house

All this within a hundred miles of London he said Looks as if it
had had nervous prostration too The footpath turned the shoulder of
a slope through a thicket of rank rhododendrons and crossed what had
once been a carriage drive which ended in the shadow of two gigantic
holmoaks

A house said Sophie in a whisper A Colonial house

Behind the bluegreen of the twin trees rose a darkbluish brick
Georgian pile with a shellshaped fanlight over its pillared door The
hound had gone off on his own foolish quests Except for some stir it
the branches and the flight of four startled magpies there was neither
life nor sound about the square house but it looked out of its long
windows most friendlily

Chaarmed to meet you Im sure said Sophie and curtsied to the
ground George this is history I can understand We began here She
curtsied again

The June sunshine twinkled on all the lights It was as though an old
lady wise in three generations experience but for the present sitting
out bent to listen to her flushed and eager grandchild

I must look Sophie tiptoed to a window and shaded her eyes with her
hand Oh this rooms halffull of cottonbaleswool I suppose But I
can see a bit of the mantelpiece George do come Isnt that some one

She fell back behind her husband The front door opened slowly to show
the hound his nose white with milk in charge of an ancient of days
clad in a blue linen ephod curiously gathered on breast and shoulders

Certainly said George half aloud Father Time himself This is
where he lives Sophie

We came said Sophie weakly Can we see the house Im afraid thats
our dog

No tis Rambler said the old man Hes been at my swillpail
again Staying at Rocketts be ye Come in Ah you runagate

The hound broke from him and he tottered after him down the drive They
entered the halljust such a high light hall as such a house
should own A slimbalustered staircase wide and shallow and once
creamywhite climbed out of it under a long oval window On either side
delicately moulded doors gave on to woollumbered rooms whose seagreen
mantelpieces were adorned with nymphs scrolls and Cupids in low
relief

Whats the firm that makes these things cried Sophie enraptured
Oh I forgot These must be the originals Adams is it I never
dreamed of anything like that steelcut fender Does he mean us to go
everywhere

Hes catching the dog said George looking out We dont count

They explored the first or ground floor delighted as children playing
burglars

This is like all England she said at last Wonderful but no
explanation Youre expected to know it beforehand Now lets try
upstairs

The stairs never creaked beneath their feet From the broad landing
they entered a long greenpanelled room lighted by three fulllength
windows which overlooked the forlorn wreck of a terraced garden and
wooded slopes beyond

The drawingroom of course Sophie swam up and down it That
mantelpieceOrpheus and Eurydiceis the best of them all Isnt it
marvellous Why the room seems furnished with nothing in it Hows
that George

Its the proportions Ive noticed it

I saw a Heppelwhite couch onceSophie laid her finger to her flushed
cheek and considered With two of themone on each sideyou wouldnt
need anything else Exceptthere must be one perfect mirror over that
mantelpiece

Look at that view Its a framed Constable her husband cried

No its a Morlanda parody of a Morland But about that couch
George Dont you think Empire might be better than Heppelwhite Dull
gold against that pale green Its a pity they dont make spinets
nowadays

I believe you can get them Look at that oak wood behind the pines

While you sat and played toccatas stately at the clavichord Sophie
hummed and head on one side nodded to where the perfect mirror
should hang

Then they found bedrooms with dressingrooms and powderingclosets and
steps leading up and downboxes of rooms round square and octagonal
with enriched ceilings and chased doorlocks

Now about servants Oh She had darted up the last stairs to the
chequered darkness of the top floor where loose tiles lay among broken
laths and the walls were scrawled with names sentiments and hop
records Theyve been keeping pigeons here she cried

And you could drive a buggy through the roof anywhere said George

Thats what I say the old man cried below them on the stairs Not a
dry place for my pigeons at all

But why was it allowed to get like this said Sophie

Tis with housen as teeth he replied Let em go too far and theres
nothing to be done Time was they was minded to sell her but none would
buy She was too far away along from any place Time was theyd ha
lived here theyselves but they took and died

Here Sophie moved beneath the light of a hole in the roof

Nahnone dies here excep falling off ricks and such In London they
died He plucked a lock of wool from his blue smock They was no
stapleneither the Elphicks nor the Moones Shart and brittle all
of em Dead they be seventeen year for Ive been here caretakin
twentyfive

Who does all the wool belong to downstairs George asked

To the estate Ill show you the back parts if ye like Youre from
America aint ye Ive had a son there once myself They followed him
down the main stairway He paused at the turn and swept one hand toward
the wall Plenty room here for your coffin to come down Seven foot
and three men at each end wouldnt brish the paint If I die in my bed
theyll ave to upend me like a milkcan Tis all luck dye see

He led them on and on through a maze of back kitchens dairies
larders and sculleries that melted along covered ways into a
farmhouse visibly older than the main building which again rambled
out among barns byres pigpens stalls and stables to the dead fields
behind

Somehow said Sophie sitting exhausted on an ancient
wellcurbsomehow one wouldnt insult these lovely old things by
filling them with hay

George looked at long stone walls upholding reaches of silveryoak
weatherboarding buttresses of mixed flint and bricks outside stairs
stone upon arched stone curves of thatch where grass sprouted roundels
of houseleeked tiles and a huge paved yard populated by two cows and
the repentant Rambler He had not thought of himself or of the telegraph
office for two and a half hours

But why said Sophie as they went back through the crater of stricken
fieldswhy is one expected to know everything in England Why do
they never tell

You mean about the Elphicks and the Moones he answered

Yesand the lawyers and the estate Who are they I wonder whether
those painted floors in the green room were real oak Dont you like us
exploring things togetherbetter than Pompeii

George turned once more to look at the view Eight hundred acres go
with the housethe old man told me Five farms altogether Rocketts is
one of em

I like Mrs Cloke But what is the old house called

George laughed Thats one of the things youre expected to know He
never told me

The Clokes were more communicative That evening and thereafter for
a week they gave the Chapins the official history as one gives it to
lodgers of Friars Pardon the house and its five farms But Sophie
asked so many questions and George was so humanly interested that
as confidence in the strangers grew they launched with observed and
acquired detail into the lives and deaths and doings of the Elphicks
and the Moones and their collaterals the Haylings and the Torrells It
was a tale told serially by Cloke in the barn or his wife in the dairy
the last chapters reserved for the kitchen o nights by the big fire
when the two had been half the day exploring about the house where
old Iggulden of the blue smock cackled and chuckled to see them The
motives that swayed the characters were beyond their comprehension the
fates that shifted them were gods they had never met the sidelights
Mrs Cloke threw on act and incident were more amazing than anything in
the record Therefore the Chapins listened delightedly and blessed Mrs
Shonts

But whywhywhydid Soandso do soandso Sophie would demand
from her seat by the pothook and Mrs Cloke would answer smoothing her
knees For the sake of the place

I give it up said George one night in their own room People dont
seem to matter in this country compared to the places they live in The
way she tells it Friars Pardon was a sort of Moloch

Poor old thing They had been walking round the farms as usual before
tea No wonder they loved it Think of the sacrifices they made for it
Jane Elphick married the younger Torrell to keep it in the family The
octagonal room with the moulded ceiling next to the big bedroom was
hers Now what did he tell you while he was feeding the pigs said
Sophie

About the Torrell cousins and the uncle who died in Java They lived at
Burnt Housebehind High Pardons where that brook is all blocked up

No Burnt House is under High Pardons Wood before you come to Gale
Anstey Sophie corrected

Well old man Cloke said

Sophie threw open the door and called down into the kitchen where the
Clokes were covering the fire Mrs Cloke isnt Burnt House under High
Pardons

Yes my dear of course the soft voice answered absently A cough
I beg your pardon Madam What was it you said

Never mind I prefer it the other way Sophie laughed and George
retold the missing chapter as she sat on the bed

Here today an gone tomorrow said Cloke warningly Theyve
paid their first month but weve only that Mrs Shontss letter for
guarantee

None she sent never cheated us yet It slipped out before I thought
Shes a most humane young lady Theyll be going away in a little An
youve talked a lot too Alfred

Yes but the Elphicks are all dead No one can bring my loose talking
home to me But why do they stay on and stay on so

In due time George and Sophie asked each other that question and put it
aside They argued that the climatea pearly blend unlike the hot
and cold ferocities of their native landsuited them as the thick
stillness of the nights certainly suited George He was saved even the
sight of a metalled road which as presumably leading to business
wakes desire in a man and the telegraph office at the village of Friars
Pardon where they sold picture postcards and pegtops was two walking
miles across the fields and woods

For all that touched his past among his fellows or their remembrance
of him he might have been in another planet and Sophie whose life had
been very largely spent among husbandless wives of lofty ideals had
no wish to leave this present of God The unhurried meals the
foreknowledge of deliciously empty hours to follow the breadths of soft
sky under which they walked together and reckoned time only by their
hunger or thirst the good grass beneath their feet that cheated the
miles their discoveries always together amid the farmsGriffons
Rocketts Burnt House Gale Anstey and the Home Farm where Iggulden of
the blue smockfrock would waylay them and they would ransack the old
house once more the long wet afternoons when they tucked up their
feet on the bedrooms deep windowsill over against the appletrees and
talked together as never till then had they found time to talkthese
things contented her soul and her body throve

Have you realized she asked one morning that weve been here
absolutely alone for the last thirtyfour days

Have you counted them he asked

Did you like them she replied

I must have I didnt think about them Yes I have Six months ago I
should have fretted myself sick Remember at Cairo Ive only had two or
three bad times Am I getting better or is it senile decay

Climate all climate Sophie swung her newbought English boots as
she sat on the stile overlooking Friars Pardon behind the Clokess
barn

One must take hold of things though he said if its only to keep
ones hand in His eyes did not flicker now as they swept the empty
fields Mustnt one

Lay out a Morristown links over Gale Anstey I dare say you could hire
it

No Im not as English as thatnor as Morristown Cloke says all the
farms here could be made to pay

Well Im Anastasia in the Treasure of Franchard Im content to be
alive and purr Theres no hurry

No He smiled All the same Im going to see after my mail

You promised you wouldnt have any

Theres some business coming through thats amusing me Honest It
doesnt get on my nerves at all

Want a secretary

No thanks old thing Isnt that quite English

Too English Go away But none the less in broad daylight she returned
the kiss Im off to Pardons I havent been to the house for nearly a
week

Howve you decided to furnish Jane Elphicks bedroom he laughed for
it had come to be a permanent Castle in Spain between them

Black Chinese furniture and yellow silk brocade she answered and
ran downhill She scattered a few cows at a gap with a flourish of a
groundash that Iggulden had cut for her a week ago and singing as she
passed under the holmoaks sought the farmhouse at the back of
Friars Pardon The old man was not to be found and she knocked at
his halfopened door for she needed him to fill her idle forenoon A
blueeyed sheepdog a new friend and Ramblers old enemy crawled out
and besought her to enter

Iggulden sat in his chair by the fire a thistlespud between his knees
his head drooped Though she had never seen death before her heart
that missed a beat told her that he was dead She did not speak or cry
but stood outside the door and the dog licked her hand When he threw
up his nose she heard herself saying Dont howl Please dont begin
to howl Scottie or I shall run away

She held her ground while the shadows in the rickyard moved toward noon
sat after a while on the steps by the door her arms round the dogs
neck waiting till some one should come She watched the smokeless
chimneys of Friars Pardon slash its roofs with shadow and the smoke of
Igguldens last lighted fire gradually thin and cease Against her will
she fell to wondering how many Moones Elphicks and Torrells had been
swung round the turn of the broad Mall stairs Then she remembered the
old mans talk of being upended like a milkcan and buried her face
on Scotties neck At last a horses feet clinked upon flags rustled
in the old grey straw of the rickyard and she found herself facing
the vicara figure she had seen at church declaiming impossibilities
Sophie was a Unitarian in an unnatural voice

Hes dead she said without preface

Old Iggulden I was coming for a talk with him The vicar passed in
uncovered Ah she heard him say Heartfailure How long have you
been here

Since a quarter to eleven She looked at her watch earnestly and saw
that her hand did not shake

Ill sit with him now till the doctor comes Dyou think you could
tell him andyes Mrs Betts in the cottage with the wistaria next the
blacksmiths Im afraid this has been rather a shock to you

Sophie nodded and fled toward the village Her body failed her for a
moment she dropped beneath a hedge and looked back at the great house
In some fashion its silence and stolidity steadied her for her errand

Mrs Betts small blackeyed and dark was almost as unconcerned as
Friars Pardon

Yiss yiss of course Dear me Well Iggulden he had had his day in my
fathers time Muriel get me my little blue bag please Yiss maam
They come down like ellumbranches in still weather No warnin at all
Muriel my bicycles beind the fowlhouse Ill tell Dr Dallas maam

She trundled off on her wheel like a brown bee while Sophieheaven
above and earth beneath changedwalked stiffly home to fall over
George at his letters in a muddle of laughter and tears

Its all quite natural for them she gasped They come down like
ellumbranches in still weather Yiss maam No there wasnt anything
in the least horrible onlyonlyOh George that poor shiny stick of
his between his poor thin knees I couldnt have borne it if Scottie
had howled I didnt know the vicar was soso sensitive He said he was
afraid it was rarather a shock Mrs Betts told me to go home and
I wanted to collapse on her floor But I didnt disgrace myself II
couldnt have left himcould I

Youre sure youve took no arm cried Mrs Cloke who had heard the
news by farmtelegraphy which is older but swifter than Marconis

No Im perfectly well Sophie protested

You lay down till teatime Mrs Cloke patted her shoulder THEYll
be very pleased though she as ad no proper understandin for twenty
years

They came before twilighta blackbearded man in moleskins and a
little palsied old woman who chirruped like a wren

Im his son said the man to Sophie among the lavender bushes We
ad a differencetwenty year back and didnt speak since But Im his
son all the same and we thank you for the watching

Im only glad I happened to be there she answered and from the
bottom of her heart she meant it

We heard he spoke a lot o youone time an another since you came We
thank you kindly the man added

Are you the son that was in America she asked

Yes maam On my uncles farm in Connecticut He was what they call
roodmaster there

Whereabouts in Connecticut asked George over her shoulder

Veering Holler was the name I was there six year with my uncle

How small the world is Sophie cried Why all my mothers people
come from Veering Hollow There must be some there stillthe Lashmars
Did you ever hear of them

I remember hearing that name seems to me he answered but his face
was blank as the back of a spade

A little before dusk a woman in grey striding like a footsoldier and
bearing on her arm a long pole crashed through the orchard calling for
food George upon whom the unannounced English worked mysteriously
fled to the parlour but Mrs Cloke came forward beaming Sophie could
not escape

Weve only just heard of it said the stranger turning on her Ive
been out with the otterhounds all day It was a splendidly sportin
thing

Did youerkill said Sophie She knew from books she could not go
far wrong here

Yes a dry bitchseventeen pounds was the answer A splendidly
sportin thing of you to do Poor old Iggulden

Ohthat said Sophie enlightened

If there had been any people at Pardons it would never have happened
Hed have been looked after But what can you expect from a parcel of
London solicitors

Mrs Cloke murmured something

No Im soaked from the knees down If I hang about I shall get
chilled A cup of tea Mrs Cloke and I can eat one of your sandwiches
as I go She wiped her weatherworn face with a green and yellow silk
handkerchief

Yes my lady Mrs Cloke ran and returned swiftly

Our land marches with Pardons for a mile on the south she explained
waving the full cup but one has quite enough to do with ones own
people without poachin Still if Id known Id have sent Dora of
course Have you seen her this afternoon Mrs Cloke No I wonder
whether that girl did sprain her ankle Thank you It was a formidable
hunk of bread and bacon that Mrs Cloke presented As I was sayin
Pardons is a scandal Lettin people die like dogs There ought to be
people there who do their duty Youve done yours though there wasnt
the faintest call upon you Good night Tell Dora if she comes Ive
gone on

She strode away munching her crust and Sophie reeled breathless into
the parlour to shake the shaking George

Why did you keep catching my eye behind the blind Why didnt you come
out and do your duty

Because I should have burst Did you see the mud on its cheek he
said

Once I darent look again Who is she

Goda local deity then Anyway shes another of the things youre
expected to know by instinct

Mrs Cloke shocked at their levity told them that it was Lady
Conant wife of Sir Walter Conant Baronet a large landholder in the
neighbourhood and if not God at least His visible Providence George
made her talk of that family for an hour

Laughter said Sophie afterward in their own room is the mark of the
savage Why couldnt you control your emotions Its all real to her

Its all real to me Thats my trouble he answered in an altered
tone Anyway its real enough to mark time with Dont you think so

What dyou mean she asked quickly though she knew his voice

That Im better Im well enough to kick

What at

This He waved his hand round the one room I must have something to
play with till Im fit for work again

Ah She sat on the bed and leaned forward her hands clasped I
wonder if its good for you

Weve been better here than anywhere he went on slowly One could
always sell it again

She nodded gravely but her eyes sparkled

The only thing that worries me is what happened this morning I want to
know how you feel about it If its on your nerves in the least we can
have the old farm at the back of the house pulled down or perhaps it
has spoiled the notion for you

Pull it down she cried Youve no business faculty Why thats
where we could live while were putting the big house in order Its
almost under the same roof No What happened this morning seemed to be
more of aof a leading than anything else There ought to be people at
Pardons Lady Conants quite right

I was thinking more of the woods and the roads I could double the
value of the place in six months

What do they want for it She shook her head and her loosened hair
fell glowingly about her cheeks

Seventyfive thousand dollars Theyll take sixtyeight

Less than half what we paid for our old yacht when we married And we
didnt have a good time in her You were

Well I discovered I was too much of an American to be content to be a
rich mans son You arent blaming me for that

Oh no Only it was a very businesslike honeymoon How far are you
along with the deal George

I can mail the deposit on the purchase money tomorrow morning and we
can have the thing completed in a fortnight or three weeksif you say
so

Friars PardonFriars Pardon Sophie chanted rapturously her dark
gray eyes big with delight All the farms Gale Anstey Burnt House
Rocketts the Home Farm and Griffons Sure youve got em all

Sure He smiled

And the woods High Pardons Wood Lower Pardons Suttons Duttons
Shaw Reubens Ghyll Maxeys Ghyll and both the Oak Hangers Sure
youve got em all

Every last stick Why you know them as well as I do He laughed
They say theres five thousanda thousand pounds worth of
lumbertimber they call itin the Hangers alone

Mrs Clokes oven must be mended first thing and the kitchen roof I
think Ill have all this whitewashed Sophie broke in pointing to
the ceiling The whole place is a scandal Lady Conant is quite right
George when did you begin to fall in love with the house In the
greenroom that first day I did

Im not in love with it One must do something to mark time till ones
fit for work

Or when we stood under the oaks and the door opened Oh Ought I to go
to poor Igguldens funeral She sighed with utter happiness

Wouldnt they call it a liberty now said he

But I liked him

But you didnt own him at the date of his death

That wouldnt keep me away Only they made such a fuss about the
watchingshe caught her breathit might be ostentatious from that
point of view too Oh Georgeshe reached for his handwere two
little orphans moving in worlds not realized and we shall make some bad
breaks But were going to have the time of our lives

Well run up to London tomorrow and see if we can hurry those English
law solicitors I want to get to work

They went They suffered many things ere they returned across the fields
in a fly one Saturday night nursing a two by twoandahalf box of
deeds and mapslawful owners of Friars Pardon and the five decayed
farms therewith

I do most sincerely ope and trust youll be appy Madam Mrs Cloke
gasped when she was told the news by the kitchen fire

Goodness It isnt a marriage Sophie exclaimed a little awed for to
them the joke which to an American means work was only just beginning

If its took in a proper spiritMrs Clokes eye turned toward her
oven

Send and have that mended tomorrow Sophie whispered

We couldnt elp noticing said Cloke slowly from the times you
walked there that you an your lady was drawn to it butbut I dont
know as we ever precisely thought His wifes glance checked him

That we were that sort of people said George We arent sure of it
ourselves yet

Perhaps said Cloke rubbing his knees just for the sake of saying
something perhaps youll park it

Whats that said George

Turn it all into a fine park like Violet Hillhe jerked a thumb to
westwardthat Mr Sangres bought It was four farms and Mr Sangres
made a fine park of them with a herd of faller deer

Then it wouldnt be Friars Pardon said Sophie Would it

I dont know as Ive ever heard Pardons was ever anything but wheat an
wool Only some gentlemen say that parks are less trouble than tenants
He laughed nervously But the gentry o course they keep on pretty
much as they was used to

I see said Sophie How did Mr Sangres make his money

I never rightly heard It was pepper an spices or it may ha been
gloves No Gloves was Sir Reginald Liss at Marley End Spices was Mr
Sangres Hes a Brazilian gentlemanvery sunburnt like

Be sure o one thing You wont ave any trouble said Mrs Cloke
just before they went to bed

Now the news of the purchase was told to Mr and Mrs Cloke alone at 8
PM of a Saturday None left the farm till they set out for church next
morning Yet when they reached the church and were about to slip aside
into their usual seats a little beyond the font where they could see
the redfurred tails of the bellropes waggle and twist at ringing time
they were swept forward irresistibly a Cloke on either flank and yet
they had not walked with the Clokes upon the everretiring bosom of a
blackgowned verger who ushered them into a room of a pew at the head
of the left aisle under the pulpit

This he sighed reproachfully is the Pardons Pew and shut them
in

They could see little more than the choir boys in the chancel but to
the roots of the hair of their necks they felt the congregation behind
mercilessly devouring them by look

When the wicked man turneth away The strong alien voice of the
priest vibrated under the hammerbeam roof and a loneliness unfelt
before swamped their hearts as they searched for places in the
unfamiliar Church of England service The Lords Prayer Our Father
which artset the seal on that desolation Sophie found herself
thinking how in other lands their purchase would long ere this have been
discussed from every point of view in a dozen prints forgetting that
George for months had not been allowed to glance at those black and
bellowing headlines Here was nothing but silencenot even hostility
The game was up to them the other players hid their cards and waited
Suspense she felt was in the air and when her sight cleared saw
indeed a mural tablet of a footless bird brooding upon the carven
motto Wayte awhylewayte awhyle

At the Litany George had trouble with an unstable hassock and drew the
slip of carpet under the pewseat Sophie pushed her end back also and
shut her eyes against a burning that felt like tears When she opened
them she was looking at her mothers maiden name fairly carved on a
blue flagstone on the pew floor Ellen Lashmar ob 1796 aetat 27

She nudged George and pointed Sheltered as they kneeled they looked
for more knowledge but the rest of the slab was blank

Ever hear of her he whispered

Never knew any of us came from here

Coincidence

Perhaps But it makes me feel better and she smiled and winked away
a tear on her lashes and took his hand while they prayed for all women
labouring of childnot in the perils of childbirth and the sparrows
who had found their way through the guards behind the glass windows
chirped above the faded gilt and alabaster family tree of the Conants

The baronets pew was on the right of the aisle After service its
inhabitants moved forth without haste but so as to block effectively a
dusky person with a large family who champed in their rear

Spices I think said Sophie deeply delighted as the Sangres closed
up after the Conants Let em get away George

But when they came out many folk whose eyes were one still lingered by
the lychgate

I want to see if any more Lashmars are buried here said Sophie

Not now This seems to be show day Come home quickly he replied

A group of families the Clokes a little apart opened to let them
through The men saluted with jerky nods the women with remnants of a
curtsey Only Igguldens son his mother on his arm lifted his hat as
Sophie passed

Your people said the clear voice of Lady Conant in her ear

I suppose so said Sophie blushing for they were within two yards of
her but it was not a question

Then that child looks as if it were coming down with mumps You ought
to tell the mother she shouldnt have brought it to church

I cant leave er behind my lady the woman said Shed set the
ouse afire in a minute shes that forward with the matches Aint you
Maudie dear

Has Dr Dallas seen her

Not yet my lady

He must You cant get away of course Mm My idiotic maid is coming
in for her teeth tomorrow at twelve She shall pick her upat Gale
Anstey isnt itat eleven

Yes Thank you very much my lady

I oughtnt to have done it said Lady Conant apologetically but
there has been no one at Pardons for so long that youll forgive my
poaching Now cant you lunch with us The vicar usually comes too
I dont use the horses on a Sundayshe glanced at the Brazilians
silverplated chariot Its only a mile across the fields

Youyoure very kind said Sophie hating herself because her lip
trembled

My dear the compelling tone dropped to a soothing gurgle dyou
suppose I dont know how it feels to come to a strange countycountry
I should sayaway from ones own people When I first left the
ShiresIm Shropshire you knowI cried for a day and a night But
fretting doesnt make loneliness any better Oh heres Dora She did
sprain her leg that day

Im as lame as a tree still said the tall maiden frankly You ought
to go out with the otterhounds Mrs Chapin I believe theyre drawing
your water next week

Sir Walter had already led off George and the vicar came up on the
other side of Sophie There was no escaping the swift procession or the
leisurely lunch where talk came and went in lowvoiced eddies that
had the village for their centre Sophie heard the vicar and Sir Walter
address her husband lightly as Chapin She also remembered many women
known in a previous life who habitually addressed their husbands as
Mr Suchanone After lunch Lady Conant talked to her explicitly of
maternity as that is achieved in cottages and farmhouses remote from
aid and of the duty thereto of the mistress of Pardons

A gate in a beech hedge reached across triple lawns let them out
before teatime into the unkempt south side of their land

I want your hand please said Sophie as soon as they were safe among
the beech boles and the lawless hollies Dyou remember the old maid in
Providence and the Guitar who heard the Commissary swear and hardly
reckoned herself a maiden lady afterward Because Im a relative of
hers Lady Conant is

Did you find out anything about the Lashmars he interrupted

I didnt ask Im going to write to Aunt Sydney about it first Oh
Lady Conant said something at lunch about their having bought some land
from some Lashmars a few years ago I found it was at the beginning of
last century

What did you say

I said Really how interesting Like that Im not going to push
myself forward Ive been hearing about Mr Sangress efforts in that
direction And you I couldnt see you behind the flowers Was it very
deep water dear

George mopped a brow already browned by outdoor exposures

Oh nodead easy he answered Ive bought Friars Pardon to prevent
Sir Walters birds straying

A cock pheasant scuttered through the dry leaves and exploded almost
under their feet Sophie jumped

Thats one of em said George calmly

Well your nerves are better at any rate said she Did you tell em
youd bought the thing to play with

No That was where my nerve broke down I only made one bad breakI
think I said I couldnt see why hiring land to men to farm wasnt as
much a business proposition as anything else

And what did they say

They smiled I shall know what that smile means some day They dont
waste their smiles Dyou see that track by Gale Anstey

They looked down from the edge of the hanger over a cuplike hollow
People by twos and threes in their Sunday best filed slowly along the
paths that connected farm to farm

Ive never seen so many on our land before said Sophie Why is it

To show us we mustnt shut up their rights of way

Those cowtracks weve been using cross lots said Sophie forcibly

Yes Any one of em would cost us two thousand pounds each in legal
expenses to close

But we dont want to she said

The whole community would fight if we did

But its our land We can do what we like

Its not our land Weve only paid for it We belong to it and it
belongs to the peopleour people they call em Ive been to lunch with
the English too

They passed slowly from one brackendotted field to the nextflushed
with pride of ownership plotting alterations and restorations at each
turn halting in their tracks to argue spreading apart to embrace two
views at once or closing in to consider one Couples moved out of their
way but smiling covertly

We shall make some bad breaks he said at last

Together though You wont let anyone else in will you

Except the contractors This syndicate handles this proposition by its
little lone

But you might feel the want of some one she insisted

I shallbut it will be you Its business Sophie but its going to
be good fun

Please God she answered flushing and cried to herself as they went
back to tea Its worth it Oh its worth it

The repairing and moving into Friars Pardon was business of the most
varied and searching but all done English fashion without friction
Time and money alone were asked The rest lay in the hands of beneficent
advisers from London or spirits male and female called up by Mr and
Mrs Cloke from the wastes of the farms In the centre stood George and
Sophie a little aghast their interests reaching out on every side

I aint sayin anything against Londoners said Cloke selfappointed
clerk of the outer works consulting engineer head of the immigration
bureau and superintendent of woods and forests but your own people
wont go about to make more than a fair profit out of you

How is one to know said George

Five years from now or so on maybe youll be lookin over your first
years accounts and knowin what youll know then youll say Well
Billy Beartupor Old Cloke as it might bedid me proper when I was
new No man likes to have that sort of thing laid up against him

I think I see said George But five years is a long time to look
ahead

I doubt if that oak Billy Beartup throwed in Reubens Ghyll will be fit
for her drawinroom floor in less than seven Cloke drawled

Yes thats my work said Sophie Billy Beartup of Griffons
a woodman by training and birth a tenant farmer by misfortune of
marriage had laid his broad axe at her feet a month before Sorry if
Ive committed you to another eternity

And we shant even know where weve gone wrong with your new carriage
drive before that time either said Cloke ever anxious to keep the
balance true with an ounce or two in Sophies favour The past four
months had taught George better than to reply The carriage road winding
up the hill was his present keen interest They set off to look at it
and the imported American scraper which had blighted the none too sunny
soul of Skim Winsh the carter

But young Iggulden was in charge now and under his guidance Buller and
Roberts the great horses moved mountains

You lif her like that an you tip her like that he explained to the
gang My uncle he was roadmaster in Connecticut

Are they roads yonder said Skim sitting under the laurels

No better than accommodation roads Dirt they call em Theyd suit
you Skim

Why said the incautious Skim

Cause youd take no hurt when you fall out of your cart drunk on a
Saturday was the answer

I didnt last time neither Skim roared

After the loud laugh old Whybarne of Gale Anstey piped feebly Well
dirt or no dirt theres no denyin Chapin knows a good job when he
sees it E dont build one day and deestroy the next like that nigger
Sangres

SHEs the one that knows her own mind said Pinky brother to Skim
Winsh and a Napoleon among carters who had helped to bring the grand
piano across the fields in the autumn rains

She had ought to said Iggulden Whoa Buller Shes a Lashmar They
never was doublethinking

Oh you found that Has the answer come from your uncle said Skim
doubtful whether so remote a land as America had posts

The others looked at him scornfully Skim was always a day behind the
fair Iggulden rested from his labours Shes a Lashmar right enough
I started up to write to my uncleat oncethe month after she said her
folks came from Veering Holler

Where there aint any roads Skim interrupted but none laughed

My uncle he married an American woman for his second and she took
it up like a like the coroner Shes a Lashmar out of the old Lashmar
place fore they sold to Conants She aint no Toot Hill Lashmar nor
any o the Crayford lot Her folk come out of the ground here neither
chalk nor forest but wildishers They sailed over to AmericaIve got
it all writ down by my uncles womanin eighteen hundred an nothing
My uncle says theyre all slow begetters like

Would they be gentry yonder now Skim asked

Nahtheres no gentry in America no matter how long youre there
Its against their law Theres only rich and poor allowed Theyve
been lawyers and such like over yonder for a hundred years but shes a
Lashmar for all that

Lord Whats a hundred years said Whybarne who had seen
seventyeight of them

An they write too from yondermy uncles woman writesthat you can
still tell em by headmark Their hairs foxyred stillan they throw
out when they walk Hes intoedtreads like a gipsy but you watch an
youll see er throw outlike a colt

Your trace wants taking up Pinkys large ears had caught the sound
of voices and as the two broke through the laurels the men were hard at
work their eyes on Sophies feet

She had been less fortunate in her inquiries than Iggulden for her Aunt
Sydney of Meriden a badged and certificated Daughter of the Revolution
to boot answered her inquiries with a twopaged discourse on
patriotism the leaflets of a Village Improvement Society of which she
was president and a demand for an overdue subscription to a Factory
Girls Reading Circle Sophie burned it all in the Orpheus and Eurydice
grate and kept her own counsel

What I want to know said George when Spring was coming and the
gardens needed thought is who will ever pay me for my labour Ive put
in at least half a million dollars worth already

Sure youre not taking too much out of yourself his wife asked

Oh no I havent been conscious of myself all winter He looked at
his brown English gaiters and smiled Its all behind me now I believe
I could sit down and think of all thatthose months before we sailed

Dontah dont she cried

But I must go back one day You dont want to keep me out of business
alwaysor do you He ended with a nervous laugh

Sophie sighed as she drew her own groundash of old Igguldens cutting
from the hall rack

Arent you overdoing it too You look a little tired he said

You make me tired Im going to Rocketts to see Mrs Cloke about Mary
This was the sister of the telegraphist promoted to be sewingmaid at
Pardons Coming

Im due at Burnt House to see about the new well By the way theres a
sore throat at Gale Anstey

Thats my province Dont interfere The Whybarne children always have
sore throats They do it for jujubes

Keep away from Gale Anstey till I make sure honey Cloke ought to have
told me

These people dont tell Havent you learnt that yet But Ill obey me
lord See you later

She set off afoot for within the three main roads that bounded the
blunt triangle of the estate even by night one could scarcely hear the
carts on them wheels were not used except for farm work The footpaths
served all other purposes And though at first they had planned
improvements they had soon fallen in with the customs of their hidden
kingdom and moved about the softfooted ways by woodland hedgerow and
shaw as freely as the rabbits Indeed for the most part Sophie walked
bareheaded beneath her helmet of chestnut hair but she had been plagued
of late by vague toothaches which she explained to Mrs Cloke who
asked some questions How it came about Sophie never knew but after a
while behold Mrs Clokes arm was about her waist and her head was on
that deep bosom behind the shut kitchen door

My dear My dear the elder woman almost sobbed An dyou mean
to tell me you never suspicioned Whywhywhere was you ever taught
anything at all Of course it is Its what weve been only waitin for
all of us Time and again Ive said to Lady she checked herself An
now we shall be as we should be

Butbutbut Sophie whimpered

An to see you buildin your nest so busypianos and booksan never
thinkin of a nursery

No more I did Sophie sat bolt upright and began to laugh

Time enough yet The fingers tapped thoughtfully on the broad knee
Butthey must be strangeminded folk over yonder with you Have you
thought to send for your mother She dead My dear my dear Never
mind Shell be happy where she knows Tis Gods work An we was only
waitin for it for youve never failed in your duty yet It aint
your way What did you say about my Marys doings Mrs Clokes face
hardened as she pressed her chin on Sophies forehead If any of your
girls thinks to beave arbitrary now IllBut they wont my dear
Ill see they do their duty too Be sure youll ave no trouble

When Sophie walked back across the fields heaven and earth changed about
her as on the day of old Igguldens death For an instant she thought
of the wide turn of the staircase and the new ivorywhite paint that
no coffin corner could scar but presently the shadow passed in a pure
wonder and bewilderment that made her reel She leaned against one of
their new gates and looked over their lands for some other stay

Well she said resignedly half aloud we must try to make him feel
that he isnt a third in our party and turned the corner that looked
over Friars Pardon giddy sick and faint

Of a sudden the house they had bought for a whim stood up as she had
never seen it before lowfronted broadwinged ample prepared by
course of generations for all such things As it had steadied her when
it lay desolate so now that it had meaning from their few months of
life within it soothed and promised good She went alone and quickly
into the hall and kissed either doorpost whispering Be good to me
You know Youve never failed in your duty yet

When the matter was explained to George he would have sailed at once to
their own land but this Sophie forbade

I dont want science she said I just want to be loved and there
isnt time for that at home Besides she added looking out of the
window it would be desertion

George was forced to soothe himself with linking Friars Pardon to the
telegraph system of Great Britain by telephonethreequarters of a
mile of poles put in by Whybarne and a few friends One of these was
a foreigner from the next parish Said he when the line was being run
Theres an old ellum right in our road Shall us throw her

Toot Hill parish folk neither grace nor good luck God help em Old
Whybarne shouted the local proverb from three poles down the line We
aint goin to lay any axeiron to coffinwood here not till we know
where we are yet awhile Swing round er swing round

To this day then that sudden kink in the straight line across the
upper pasture remains a mystery to Sophie and George Nor can they tell
why Skim Winsh who came to his cottage under Dutton Shaw most musically
drunk at 1045 PM of every Saturday night as his father had done
before him sang no more at the bottom of the garden steps where Sophie
always feared he would break his neck The path was undoubtedly an
ancient right of way and at 1045 PM on Saturdays Skim remembered it
was his duty to posterity to keep it opentill Mrs Cloke spoke to him
once She spoke likewise to her daughter Mary sewing maid at Pardons
and to Marys best new friend the fivefootseven imported London
housemaid who taught Mary to trim hats and found the country dullish

But there was no noiseat no time was there any noiseand when Sophie
walked abroad she met no one in her path unless she had signified a wish
that way Then they appeared to protest that all was well with them and
their children their chickens their roofs their watersupply and
their sons in the police or the railway service

But dont you find it dull dear said George loyally doing his best
not to worry as the months went by

Ive been so busy putting my house in order I havent had time to
think said she Do you

Nono If I could only be sure of you

She turned on the green drawingrooms couch it was Empire not
Heppelwhite after all and laid aside a list of linen and blankets

It has changed everything hasnt it she whispered

Oh Lord yes But I still think if we went back to Baltimore

And missed our first real summer together No thank you me lord

But were absolutely alone

Isnt that what Im doing my best to remedy Dont you worry I like
itlike it to the marrow of my little bones You dont realize what her
house means to a woman We thought we were living in it last year but
we hadnt begun to Dont you rejoice in your study George

I prefer being here with you He sat down on the floor by the couch
and took her hand

Seven she said as the French clock struck Year before last youd
just be coming back from business

He winced at the recollection then laughed Business Ive been at
work ten solid hours today

Where did you lunch With the Conants

No at Dutton Shaw sitting on a log with my feet in a swamp But
weve found out where the old spring is and were going to pipe it down
to Gale Anstey next year

Ill come and see tomorrow Oh please open the door dear I want to
look down the passage Isnt that corner by the stairhead lovely where
the sun strikes in She looked through halfclosed eyes at the vista of
ivorywhite and pale green all steeped in liquid gold

Theres a step out of Jane Elphicks bedroom she went onand his
first step in the world ought to be up I shouldnt wonder if those
people hadnt put it there on purpose George will it make any odds to
you if hes a girl

He answered as he had many times before that his interest was his
wife not the child

Then youre the only person who thinks so She laughed Dont be
silly dear Its expected I know Its my duty I shant be able to
look our people in the face if I fail

What concern is it of theirs confound em

Youll see Luckily the tradition of the house is boys Mrs Cloke
says so Im provided for Shall you ever begin to understand these
people I shant

And we bought it for funfor fun he groaned And here we are held
up for goodness knows how long

Why Were you thinking of selling it He did not answer Do you
remember the second Mrs Chapin she demanded

This was a bold brazen little blackbrowed womana widow for
choicewho on Sophies death was guilefully to marry George for his
wealth and ruin him in a year George being busy Sophie had invented
her some two years after her marriage and conceived she was alone among
wives in so doing

You arent going to bring her up again he asked anxiously

I only want to say that I should hate any one who bought Pardons ten
times worse than I used to hate the second Mrs Chapin Think what weve
put into it of our two selves

At least a couple of million dollars I know I could have made He
broke off

The beasts she went on Theyd be sure to build a redbrick lodge
at the gates and cut the lawn up for bedding out You must leave
instructions in your will that hes never to do that George wont
you

He laughed and took her hand again but said nothing till it was time to
dress Then he muttered What the devil use is a mans country to him
when he cant do business in it

Friars Pardon stood faithful to its tradition At the appointed time was
born not that third in their party to whom Sophie meant to be so kind
but a godling in beauty it was manifest excelling Eros as in wisdom
Confucius an enhancer of delights a renewer of companionships and an
interpreter of Destiny This last George did not realise till he met
Lady Conant striding through Dutton Shaw a few days after the event

My dear fellow she cried and slapped him heartily on the back I
cant tell you how glad we all are Oh shell be all right Theres
never been any trouble over the birth of an heir at Pardons Now where
the dooce is it She felt largely in her leatherboundskirt and drew
out a small silver mug I sent a note to your wife about it but my
silly ass of a groom forgot to take this You can save me a tramp Give
her my love She marched off amid her guard of grave Airedales

The mug was worn and dented above the twined initials GL was the
crest of a footless bird and the motto Wayte awhylewayte awhyle

Thats the other end of the riddle Sophie whispered when he saw her
that evening Read her note The English write beautiful notes

The warmest of welcomes to your little man I hope he will appreciate
his native land now he has come to it Though you have said nothing we
cannot of course look on him as a little stranger and so I am sending
him the old Lashmar christening mug It has been with us since Gregory
Lashmar your greatgrandmothers brother


George stared at his wife

Go on she twinkled from the pillows

mothers brother sold his place to Walters family We seem to have
acquired some of your household gods at that time but nothing survives
except the mug and the old cradle which I found in the pottingshed and
am having put in order for you I hope little GeorgeLashmar he will
be too wont hewill live to see his grandchildren cut their teeth on
his mug

 Affectionately yours
 ALICE CONANT

PSHow quiet youve kept about it all

Well Im

Dont swear said Sophie Bad for the infant mind

But how in the world did she get at it Have you ever said a word about
the Lashmars

You know the only timeto young Iggulden at Rockettswhen Iggulden
died

Your greatgrandmothers brother Shes traced the whole
connectionmore than your Aunt Sydney could do What does she mean
about our keeping quiet

Sophies eyes sparkled Ive thought that out too Weve got back at
the English at last Cant you see that she thought that we thought my
mothers being a Lashmar was one of those things wed expect the English
to find out for themselves and thats impressed her She turned
the mug in her white hands and sighed happily Wayte awhylewayte
awhyle Thats not a bad motto George Its been worth it

But still I dont quite see

I shouldnt wonder if they dont think our coming here was part of a
deeplaid scheme to be near our ancestors Theyd understand that And
look how theyve accepted us all of them

Are we so undesirable in ourselves George grunted

Be just me lord That wretched Sangres man has twice our money Can
you see Marm Conant slapping him between the shoulders Not by a jugful
The poor beast doesnt exist

Do you think its that then He looked toward the cot by the fire
where the godling snorted

The minute I get well I shall find out from Mrs Cloke what every
Lashmar gives in doles thats nicer than tips every time a Lashmite is
born Ive done my duty thus far but theres much expected of me

Entered here Mrs Cloke and hung worshipping over the cot They showed
her the mug and her face shone Oh now Lady Conants sent it itll
be all proper maam wont it George of course hed have to be but
seein what he is we was hopinall your people was hopinit ud be
Lashmar too and thatud just round it out A very andsome mug quite
unique I should imagine Wayte awhylewayte awhyle Thats true with
the Lashmars Ive heard Very slow to fill their houses they are Most
like Master George wont open is nursery till hes thirty

Poor lamb cried Sophie But how did you know my folk were Lashmars

Mrs Cloke thought deeply Im sure I cant quite say maam but Ive
a belief likely that it was something you may have let drop to young
Iggulden when you was at Rocketts That may have been what give us an
inkling An so it came out one thing in the way o talk leading to
another and those American people at Veering Holler was very obligin
with news Im told maam

Great Scott said George under his breath And this is the simple
peasant

Yiss Mrs Cloke went on An Cloke was only wonderin this
afternoonyour pillows slipped my dear you mustnt lie that
awayjust for the sake o sayin something whether you wouldnt think
well now of getting the Lashmar farms back sir They dont rightly
round off Sir Walters estate They come caterin across us more Cloke
e ud be glad to show you over any day

But Sir Walter doesnt want to sell does he

We can find out from his bailiff sir butwith cold contemptI
think that trained nurse is just comin up from her dinner so m afraid
well ave to ask you sir Now Master GeorgeAiie Wake a litty
minute lammie

A few months later the three of them were down at the brook in the Gale
Anstey woods to consider the rebuilding of a footbridge carried away by
spring floods George Lashmar Chapin wanted all the bluebells on Gods
earth that day to eat andSophie adored him in a voice like to the
cooing of a dove so business was delayed

Heres the place said his father at last among the water
forgetmenots But where the deuce are the larchpoles Cloke I told
you to have them down here ready

Well get em down if f you say so Cloke answered with a thrust of
the underlip they both knew

But I did say so What on earth have you brought that timbertug here
for We arent building a railway bridge Why in America halfadozen
twobyfour bits would be ample

I dont know nothin about that said Cloke

An Ive nothin to say against larchIF you want to make a tempry
job of it I aint ere to tell you what isnt so sir an you cant
say I ever come creepin up on you or tryin to lead you further in
than you set out

A year ago George would have danced with impatience Now he scraped a
little mud off his old gaiters with his spud and waited

All I say is that you can put up larch and make a tempry job of it
and by the time the young masters married itll have to be done again
Now Ive brought down a couple of as sweet sixbyeight oak timbers
as weve ever drawed You put em in an its off your mind or good an
all Tother wayI dont say it aint right Im only just sayin what
I thinkbut tother way hell no sooner be married than well lave it
all to do again Youve no call to regard my words but you cant get
out of that

No said George after a pause Ive been realising that for some
time Make it oak then we cant get out of it




THE RECALL

 I am the land of their fathers
 In me the virtue stays
 I will bring back my children
 After certain days
 Under their feet in the grasses
 My clinging magic runs
 They shall return as strangers
 They shall remain as sons
 Over their heads in the branches
 Of their newbought ancient trees
 I weave an incantation
 And draw them to my knees
 Scent of smoke in the evening
 Smell of rain in the night
 The hours the days and the seasons
 Order their souls aright
 Till I make plain the meaning
 Of all my thousand years
 Till I fill their hearts with knowledge
 While I fill their eyes with tears




GARMA HOSTAGE

One night a very long time ago I drove to an Indian military
cantonment called Mian Mir to see amateur theatricals At the back of
the Infantry barracks a soldier his cap over one eye rushed in front
of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway robber As a
matter of fact he was a friend of mine so I told him to go home before
any one caught him but he fell under the pole and I heard voices of a
military guard in search of some one

The driver and I coaxed him into the carriage drove home swiftly
undressed him and put him to bed where he waked next morning with
a sore headache very much ashamed When his uniform was cleaned and
dried and he had been shaved and washed and made neat I drove him back
to barracks with his arm in a fine white sling and reported that I
had accidentally run over him I did not tell this story to my
friends sergeant who was a hostile and unbelieving person but to his
lieutenant who did not know us quite so well

Three days later my friend came to call and at his heels slobbered and
fawned one of the finest bullterriersof the oldfashioned breed two
parts bull and one terrierthat I had ever set eyes on He was pure
white with a fawncoloured saddle just behind his neck and a fawn
diamond at the root of his thin whippy tail I had admired him distantly
for more than a year and Vixen my own foxterrier knew him too but
did not approve

Es for you said my friend but he did not look as though he liked
parting with him

Nonsense That dogs worth more than most men Stanley I said

Es that and more Tention

The dog rose on his hind legs and stood upright for a full minute

Eyes right

He sat on his haunches and turned his head sharp to the right At a sign
he rose and barked thrice Then he shook hands with his right paw and
bounded lightly to my shoulder Here he made himself into a necktie
limp and lifeless hanging down on either side of my neck I was told to
pick him up and throw him in the air He fell with a howl and held up
one leg

Part o the trick said his owner Youre going to die now Dig
yourself your little grave an shut your little eye

Still limping the dog hobbled to the gardenedge dug a hole and lay
down in it When told that he was cured he jumped out wagging his
tail and whining for applause He was put through halfadozen other
tricks such as showing how he would hold a man safe I was that man
and he sat down before me his teeth bared ready to spring and how
he would stop eating at the word of command I had no more than finished
praising him when my friend made a gesture that stopped the dog as
though he had been shot took a piece of blueruled canteenpaper from
his helmet handed it to me and ran away while the dog looked after him
and howled I read

SIRI give you the dog because of what you got me out of He is the
best I know for I made him myself and he is as good as a man Please
do not give him too much to eat and please do not give him back to me
for Im not going to take him if you will keep him So please do not
try to give him back any more I have kept his name back so you can
call him anything and he will answer but please do not give him back
He can kill a man as easy as anything but please do not give him too
much meat He knows more than a man

Vixen sympathetically joined her shrill little yap to the bullterriers
despairing cry and I was annoyed for I knew that a man who cares for
dogs is one thing but a man who loves one dog is quite another Dogs
are at the best no more than verminous vagrants selfscratchers foul
feeders and unclean by the law of Moses and Mohammed but a dog with
whom one lives alone for at least six months in the year a free thing
tied to you so strictly by love that without you he will not stir or
exercise a patient temperate humorous wise soul who knows your
moods before you know them yourself is not a dog under any ruling

I had Vixen who was all my dog to me and I felt what my friend must
have felt at tearing out his heart in this style and leaving it in
my garden However the dog understood clearly enough that I was his
master and did not follow the soldier As soon as he drew breath I made
much of him and Vixen yelling with jealousy flew at him Had she been
of his own sex he might have cheered himself with a fight but he only
looked worriedly when she nipped his deep iron sides laid his heavy
head on my knee and howled anew I meant to dine at the Club that
night but as darkness drew in and the dog snuffed through the empty
house like a child trying to recover from a fit of sobbing I felt that
I could not leave him to suffer his first evening alone So we fed at
home Vixen on one side and the strangerdog on the other she watching
his every mouthful and saying explicitly what she thought of his table
manners which were much better than hers

It was Vixens custom till the weather grew hot to sleep in my bed
her head on the pillow like a Christian and when morning came I would
always find that the little thing had braced her feet against the wall
and pushed me to the very edge of the cot This night she hurried to bed
purposefully every hair up one eye on the stranger who had dropped
on a mat in a helpless hopeless sort of way all four feet spread out
sighing heavily She settled her head on the pillow several times
to show her little airs and graces and struck up her usual whiney
singsong before slumber The strangerdog softly edged toward me I
put out my hand and he licked it Instantly my wrist was between Vixens
teeth and her warning aaarh said as plainly as speech that if I took
any further notice of the stranger she would bite

I caught her behind her fat neck with my left hand shook her severely
and said

Vixen if you do that again youll be put into the verandah Now
remember

She understood perfectly but the minute I released her she mouthed my
right wrist once more and waited with her ears back and all her body
flattened ready to bite The big dogs tail thumped the floor in a
humble and peacemaking way

I grabbed Vixen a second time lifted her out of bed like a rabbit
she hated that and yelled and as I had promised set her out in the
verandah with the bats and the moonlight At this she howled Then
she used coarse languagenot to me but to the bullterriertill she
coughed with exhaustion Then she ran round the house trying every door
Then she went off to the stables and barked as though some one were
stealing the horses which was an old trick of hers Last she returned
and her snuffing yelp said Ill be good Let me in and Ill be good

She was admitted and flew to her pillow When she was quieted I
whispered to the other dog You can lie on the foot of the bed The
bull jumped up at once and though I felt Vixen quiver with rage she
knew better than to protest So we slept till the morning and they had
early breakfast with me bite for bite till the horse came round and
we went for a ride I dont think the bull had ever followed a horse
before He was wild with excitement and Vixen as usual squealed and
scuttered and scooted and took charge of the procession

There was one corner of a village near by which we generally passed
with caution because all the yellow pariahdogs of the place gathered
about it

They were halfwild starving beasts and though utter cowards yet
where nine or ten of them get together they will mob and kill and eat an
English dog I kept a whip with a long lash for them

That morning they attacked Vixen who perhaps of design had moved from
beyond my horses shadow

The bull was ploughing along in the dust fifty yards behind rolling in
his run and smiling as bullterriers will I heard Vixen squeal half a
dozen of the curs closed in on her a white streak came up behind me
a cloud of dust rose near Vixen and when it cleared I saw one tall
pariah with his back broken and the bull wrenching another to earth
Vixen retreated to the protection of my whip and the bull paddled back
smiling more than ever covered with the blood of his enemies That
decided me to call him Garin of the Bloody Breast who was a great
person in his time or Garm for short so leaning forward I told him
what his temporary name would be He looked up while I repeated it and
then raced away I shouted Garin He stopped raced back and came up
to ask my will

Then I saw that my soldier friend was right and that that dog knew and
was worth more than a man At the end of the ride I gave an order which
Vixen knew and hated Go away and get washed I said Garin understood
some part of it and Vixen interpreted the rest and the two trotted off
together soberly When I went to the back verandah Vixen had been washed
snowywhite and was very proud of herself but the dogboy would not
touch Garm on any account unless I stood by So I waited while he was
being scrubbed and Garm with the soap creaming on the top of his broad
head looked at me to make sure that this was what I expected him to
endure He knew perfectly that the dogboy was only obeying orders

Another time I said to the dogboy you will wash the great dog with
Vixen when I send them home

Does he know said the dogboy who understood the ways of dogs

Garm I said another time you will be washed with Vixen

I knew that Garm understood Indeed next washingday when Vixen as
usual fled under my bed Garm stared at the doubtful dogboy in the
verandah stalked to the place where he had been washed last time and
stood rigid in the tub

But the long days in my office tried him sorely We three would drive
off in the morning at halfpast eight and come home at six or later
Vixen knowing the routine of it went to sleep under my table but
the confinement ate into Garms soul He generally sat on the verandah
looking out on the Mall and well I knew what he expected

Sometimes a company of soldiers would move along on their way to the
Fort and Garm rolled forth to inspect them or an officer in uniform
entered into the office and it was pitiful to see poor Garms welcome
to the clothnot the man He would leap at him and sniff and bark
joyously then run to the door and back again One afternoon I heard
him bay with a full throata thing I had never heard beforeand he
disappeared When I drove into my garden at the end of the day a soldier
in white uniform scrambled over the wall at the far end and the Garm
that met me was a joyous dog This happened twice or thrice a week for a
month

I pretended not to notice but Garm knew and Vixen knew He would glide
homewards from the office about four oclock as though he were only
going to look at the scenery and this he did so quietly that but for
Vixen I should not have noticed him The jealous little dog under
the table would give a sniff and a snort just loud enough to call my
attention to the flight Garm might go out forty times in the day and
Vixen would never stir but when he slunk off to see his true master in
my garden she told me in her own tongue That was the one sign she made
to prove that Garm did not altogether belong to the family They were
the best of friends at all times but Vixen explained that I was never
to forget Garm did not love me as she loved me

I never expected it The dog was not my dog could never be my dogand I
knew he was as miserable as his master who tramped eight miles a day to
see him So it seemed to me that the sooner the two were reunited the
better for all One afternoon I sent Vixen home alone in the dogcart
Garm had gone before and rode over to cantonments to find another
friend of mine who was an Irish soldier and a great friend of the dogs
master

I explained the whole case and wound up with

And now Stanleys in my garden crying over his dog Why doesnt he take
him back Theyre both unhappy

Unhappy Theres no sense in the little man any more But tis his
fit

What is his fit He travels fifty miles a week to see the brute and
he pretends not to notice me when he sees me on the road and Im as
unhappy as he is Make him take the dog back

Its his penance hes set himself I told him by way of a joke afther
youd run over him so convenient that night whin he was drunkI said
if he was a Catholic hed do penance Off he went wid that fit in his
little head an a dose of fever an nothin would suit but givin you
the dog as a hostage

Hostage for what I dont want hostages from Stanley

For his good behaviour Hes keepin straight now the way its no
pleasure to associate wid him

Has he taken the pledge

If twas only that I need not care Ye can take the pledge for three
months on an off He sez hell never see the dog again an so mark
you hell keep straight for evermore Ye know his fits Well this is
wan of them Hows the dog takin it

Like a man Hes the best dog in India Cant you make Stanley take him
back

I can do no more than I have done But ye know his fits Hes just
doin his penance What will he do when he goes to the Hills The
doctors put him on the list

It is the custom in India to send a certain number of invalids from each
regiment up to stations in the Himalayas for the hot weather and though
the men ought to enjoy the cool and the comfort they miss the society
of the barracks down below and do their best to come back or to avoid
going I felt that this move would bring matters to a head so I left
Terrence hopefully though he called after me He wont take the dog
sorr You can lay your months pay on that Ye know his fits

I never pretended to understand Private Ortheris and so I did the next
best thing I left him alone

That summer the invalids of the regiment to which my friend belonged
were ordered off to the Hills early because the doctors thought
marching in the cool of the day would do them good Their route lay
south to a place called Umballa a hundred and twenty miles or more
Then they would turn east and march up into the hills to Kasauli or
Dugshai or Subathoo I dined with the officers the night before they
leftthey were marching at five in the morning It was midnight when I
drove into my garden and surprised a white figure flying over the wall

That man said my butler has been here since nine making talk to
that dog He is quite mad

I did not tell him to go away because he has been here many times
before and because the dogboy told me that if I told him to go away
that great dog would immediately slay me He did not wish to speak to
the Protector of the Poor and he did not ask for anything to eat or
drink

Kadir Buksh said I that was well done for the dog would surely
have killed thee But I do not think the white soldier will come any
more

Garm slept ill that night and whimpered in his dreams Once he sprang up
with a clear ringing bark and I heard him wag his tail till it waked
him and the bark died out in a howl He had dreamed he was with his
master again and I nearly cried It was all Stanleys silly fault

The first halt which the detachment of invalids made was some miles
from their barracks on the Amritsar road and ten miles distant from my
house By a mere chance one of the officers drove back for another good
dinner at the Club cooking on the line of march is always bad and
there I met him He was a particular friend of mine and I knew that he
knew how to love a dog properly His pet was a big fat retriever who was
going up to the Hills for his health and though it was still April
the round brown brute puffed and panted in the Club verandah as though
he would burst

Its amazing said the officer what excuses these invalids of mine
make to get back to barracks Theres a man in my company now asked me
for leave to go back to cantonments to pay a debt hed forgotten I
was so taken by the idea I let him go and he jingled off in an ekka as
pleased as Punch Ten miles to pay a debt Wonder what it was really

If youll drive me home I think I can show you I said

So he went over to my house in his dogcart with the retriever and on
the way I told him the story of Garm

I was wondering where that brute had gone to Hes the best dog in the
regiment said my friend I offered the little fellow twenty rupees
for him a month ago But hes a hostage you say for Stanleys good
conduct Stanleys one of the best men I have when he chooses

Thats the reason why I said A secondrate man wouldnt have taken
things to heart as he has done

We drove in quietly at the far end of the garden and crept round the
house There was a place close to the wall all grown about with tamarisk
trees where I knew Garm kept his bones Even Vixen was not allowed to
sit near it In the full Indian moonlight I could see a white uniform
bending over the dog

Goodbye old man we could not help hearing Stanleys voice For
Evings sake dont get bit and go mad by any measly pidog But you can
look after yourself old man You dont get drunk an run about ittin
your friends You takes your bones an you eats your biscuit an you
kills your enemy like a gentleman Im goin awaydont owlIm goin
off to Kasauli where I wont see you no more

I could hear him holding Garms nose as the dog threw it up to the
stars

Youll stay here an beave anan Ill go away an try to beave
an I dont know ow to leave you I dont know

I think this is damn silly said the officer patting his foolish
fubsy old retriever He called to the private who leaped to his feet
marched forward and saluted

You here said the officer turning away his head

Yes sir but Im just goin back

I shall be leaving here at eleven in my cart You come with me I cant
have sick men running about fall over the place Report yourself at
eleven here

We did not say much when we went indoors but the officer muttered and
pulled his retrievers ears

He was a disgraceful overfed doormat of a dog and when he waddled off
to my cookhouse to be fed I had a brilliant idea

At eleven oclock that officers dog was nowhere to be found and you
never heard such a fuss as his owner made He called and shouted and
grew angry and hunted through my garden for half an hour

Then I said

Hes sure to turn up in the morning Send a man in by rail and Ill
find the beast and return him

Beast said the officer I value that dog considerably more than I
value any man I know Its all very fine for you to talkyour dogs
here

So she wasunder my feetand had she been missing food and wages
would have stopped in my house till her return But some people grow
fond of dogs not worth a cut of the whip My friend had to drive away at
last with Stanley in the back seat and then the dogboy said to me

What kind of animal is Bullen Sahibs dog Look at him

I went to the boys hut and the fat old reprobate was lying on a mat
carefully chained up He must have heard his master calling for twenty
minutes but had not even attempted to join him

He has no face said the dogboy scornfully He is a punniarkooter
a spaniel He never tried to get that cloth off his jaws when his
master called Now Vixenbaba would have jumped through the window and
that Great Dog would have slain me with his muzzled mouth It is true
that there are many kinds of dogs

Next evening who should turn up but Stanley The officer had sent
him back fourteen miles by rail with a note begging me to return the
retriever if I had found him and if I had not to offer huge rewards
The last train to camp left at halfpast ten and Stanley stayed till
ten talking to Garm I argued and entreated and even threatened to
shoot the bullterrier but the little man was as firm as a rock though
I gave him a good dinner and talked to him most severely Garm knew as
well as I that this was the last time he could hope to see his man and
followed Stanley like a shadow The retriever said nothing but licked
his lips after his meal and waddled off without so much as saying Thank
you to the disgusted dogboy

So that last meeting was over and I felt as wretched as Garm who
moaned in his sleep all night When we went to the office he found a
place under the table close to Vixen and dropped flat till it was
time to go home There was no more running out into the verandahs no
slinking away for stolen talks with Stanley As the weather grew warmer
the dogs were forbidden to run beside the cart but sat at my side on
the seat Vixen with her head under the crook of my left elbow and Garm
hugging the left handrail

Here Vixen was ever in great form She had to attend to all the moving
traffic such as bullockcarts that blocked the way and camels and led
ponies as well as to keep up her dignity when she passed low friends
running in the dust She never yapped for yappings sake but her
shrill high bark was known all along the Mall and other mens terriers
kiyied in reply and bullockdrivers looked over their shoulders and
gave us the road with a grin

But Garm cared for none of these things His big eyes were on the
horizon and his terrible mouth was shut There was another dog in the
office who belonged to my chief We called him Bob the Librarian
because he always imagined vain rats behind the bookshelves and in
hunting for them would drag out half the old newspaperfiles Bob was a
wellmeaning idiot but Garm did not encourage him He would slide his
head round the door panting Rats Come along Garm and Garm would
shift one forepaw over the other and curl himself round leaving Bob to
whine at a most uninterested back The office was nearly as cheerful as
a tomb in those days

Once and only once did I see Garm at all contented with his
surroundings He had gone for an unauthorised walk with Vixen early one
Sunday morning and a very young and foolish artilleryman his battery
had just moved to that part of the world tried to steal them both
Vixen of course knew better than to take food from soldiers and
besides she had just finished her breakfast So she trotted back with a
large piece of the mutton that they issue to our troops laid it down
on my verandah and looked up to see what I thought I asked her where
Garin was and she ran in front of the horse to show me the way

About a mile up the road we came across our artilleryman sitting very
stiffly on the edge of a culvert with a greasy handkerchief on his
knees Garin was in front of him looking rather pleased When the man
moved leg or hand Garin bared his teeth in silence A broken string
hung from his collar and the other half of it lay all warm in the
artillerymans still hand He explained to me keeping his eyes straight
in front of him that he had met this dog he called him awful names
walking alone and was going to take him to the Fort to be killed for a
masterless pariah

I said that Garin did not seem to me much of a pariah but that he had
better take him to the Fort if he thought best He said he did not care
to do so I told him to go to the Fort alone He said he did not want to
go at that hour but would follow my advice as soon as I had called off
the dog I instructed Garin to take him to the Fort and Garm marched
him solemnly up to the gate one mile and a half under a hot sun and I
told the quarterguard what had happened but the young artilleryman was
more angry than was at all necessary when they began to laugh Several
regiments he was told had tried to steal Garm in their time

That month the hot weather shut down in earnest and the dogs slept
in the bathroom on the cool wet bricks where the bath is placed Every
morning as soon as the man filled my bath the two jumped in and every
morning the man filled the bath a second time I said to him that he
might as well fill a small tub specially for the dogs Nay said he
smiling it is not their custom They would not understand Besides
the big bath gives them more space

The punkahcoolies who pull the punkahs day and night came to know Garin
intimately He noticed that when the swaying fan stopped I would call
out to the coolie and bid him pull with a long stroke If the man still
slept I would wake him up He discovered too that it was a good thing
to lie in the wave of air under the punkah Maybe Stanley had taught him
all about this in barracks At any rate when the punkah stopped Garin
would first growl and cock his eye at the rope and if that did not
wake the man it nearly always didhe would tiptoe forth and talk in
the sleepers ear Vixen was a clever little dog but she could never
connect the punkah and the coolie so Garin gave me grateful hours of
cool sleep Buthe was utterly wretchedas miserable as a human being
and in his misery he clung so closely to me that other men noticed it
and were envious If I moved from one room to another Garin followed
if my pen stopped scratching Garms head was thrust into my hand if
I turned half awake on the pillow Garm was up and at my side for he
knew that I was his only link with his master and day and night and
night and day his eyes asked one questionWhen is this going to end

Living with the dog as I did I never noticed that he was more than
ordinarily upset by the hot weather till one day at the Club a man
said That dog of yours will die in a week or two Hes a shadow Then
I dosed Garin with iron and quinine which he hated and I felt very
anxious He lost his appetite and Vixen was allowed to eat his dinner
under his eyes Even that did not make him swallow and we held a
consultation on him of the best mandoctor in the place a ladydoctor
who cured the sick wives of kings and the Deputy InspectorGeneral of
the veterinary service of all India They pronounced upon his symptoms
and I told them his story and Garm lay on a sofa licking my hand

Hes dying of a broken heart said the ladydoctor suddenly

Pon my word said the Deputy Inspector General I believe Mrs
Macrae is perfectly right as usual

The best mandoctor in the place wrote a prescription and the
veterinary Deputy InspectorGeneral went over it afterwards to be sure
that the drugs were in the proper dogproportions and that was the
first time in his life that our doctor ever allowed his prescriptions
to be edited It was a strong tonic and it put the dear boy on his feet
for a week or two then he lost flesh again I asked a man I knew to
take him up to the Hills with him when he went and the man came to the
door with his kit packed on the top of the carriage Garin took in the
situation at one red glance The hair rose along his back he sat down
in front of me and delivered the most awful growl I have ever heard in
the jaws of a dog I shouted to my friend to get away at once and as
soon as the carriage was out of the garden Garin laid his head on my
knee and whined So I knew his answer and devoted myself to getting
Stanleys address in the Hills

My turn to go to the cool came late in August We were allowed thirty
days holiday in a year if no one fell sick and we took it as we could
be spared My chief and Bob the Librarian had their holiday first and
when they were gone I made a calendar as I always did and hung it up
at the head of my cot tearing off one day at a time till they returned
Vixen had gone up to the Hills with me five times before and she
appreciated the cold and the damp and the beautiful wood fires there as
much as I did

Garm I said we are going back to Stanley at Kasauli
KasauliStanley Stanley Kasauli And I repeated it twenty times
It was not Kasauli really but another place Still I remembered what
Stanley had said in my garden on the last night and I dared not change
the name Then Garm began to tremble then he barked and then he leaped
up at me frisking and wagging his tail

Not now I said holding up my hand When I say Go well go
Garm I pulled out the little blanket coat and spiked collar that Vixen
always wore up in the Hills to protect her against sudden chills and
thieving leopards and I let the two smell them and talk it over What
they said of course I do not know but it made a new dog of Garm His
eyes were bright and he barked joyfully when I spoke to him He ate his
food and he killed his rats for the next three weeks and when he began
to whine I had only to say StanleyKasauli KasauliStanley to wake
him up I wish I had thought of it before

My chief came back all brown with living in the open air and very
angry at finding it so hot in the plains That same afternoon we three
and Kadir Buksh began to pack for our months holiday Vixen rolling in
and out of the bullocktrunk twenty times a minute and Garm grinning
all over and thumping on the floor with his tail Vixen knew the routine
of travelling as well as she knew my officework She went to the
station singing songs on the front seat of the carriage while Garin
sat with me She hurried into the railway carriage saw Kadir Buksh make
up my bed for the night got her drink of water and curled up with her
blackpatch eye on the tumult of the platform Garin followed her the
crowd gave him a lane all to himself and sat down on the pillows with
his eyes blazing and his tail a haze behind him

We came to Umballa in the hot misty dawn four or five men who had been
working hard fox eleven months shouting for our dalesthe twohorse
travelling carriages that were to take us up to Kalka at the foot of the
Hills It was all new to Garm He did not understand carriages where you
lay at full length on your bedding but Vixen knew and hopped into her
place at once Garin following The Kalka Road before the railway was
built was about fortyseven miles long and the horses were changed
every eight miles Most of them jibbed and kicked and plunged but
they had to go and they went rather better than usual for Garms deep
bay in their rear

There was a river to be forded and four bullocks pulled the carriage
and Vixen stuck her head out of the slidingdoor and nearly fell into
the water while she gave directions Garin was silent and curious
and rather needed reassuring about Stanley and Kasauli So we rolled
barking and yelping into Kalka for lunch and Garm ate enough for two

After Kalka the road wound among the hills and we took a curricle with
halfbroken ponies which were changed every six miles No one dreamed
of a railroad to Simla in those days for it was seven thousand feet up
in the air The road was more than fifty miles long and the regulation
pace was just as fast as the ponies could go Here again Vixen led
Garm from one carriage to the other jumped into the back seat and
shouted A cool breath from the snows met us about five miles out of
Kalka and she whined for her coat wisely fearing a chill on the
liver I had had one made for Garm too and as we climbed to the fresh
breezes I put it on and arm chewed it uncomprehendingly but I think
he was grateful

Hiyiyiyi sang Vixen as we shot round the curves Toottoottoot
went the drivers bugle at the dangerous places and yow yow bayed
Garm Kadir Buksh sat on the front seat and smiled Even he was glad to
get away from the heat of the Plains that stewed in the haze behind us
Now and then we would meet a man we knew going down to his work again
and he would say Whats it like below and I would shout Hotter
than cinders Whats it like up above and he would shout back Just
perfect and away we would go

Suddenly Kadir Buksh said over his shoulder Here is Solon and Garm
snored where he lay with his head on my knee Solon is an unpleasant
little cantonment but it has the advantage of being cool and healthy
It is all bare and windy and one generally stops at a resthouse nearby
for something to eat I got out and took both dogs with me while Kadir
Buksh made tea A soldier told us we should find Stanley out there
nodding his head towards a bare bleak hill

When we climbed to the top we spied that very Stanley who had given me
all this trouble sitting on a rock with his face in his hands and his
overcoat hanging loose about him I never saw anything so lonely and
dejected in my life as this one little man crumpled up and thinking on
the great gray hillside

Here Garm left me

He departed without a word and so far as I could see without moving
his legs He flew through the air bodily and I heard the whack of him
as he flung himself at Stanley knocking the little man clean over They
rolled on the ground together shouting and yelping and hugging I
could not see which was dog and which was man till Stanley got up and
whimpered

He told me that he had been suffering from fever at intervals and was
very weak He looked all he said but even while I watched both man and
dog plumped out to their natural sizes precisely as dried apples swell
in water Garin was on his shoulder and his breast and feet all at the
same time so that Stanley spoke all through a cloud of Garingulping
sobbing slavering Garm He did not say anything that I could
understand except that he had fancied he was going to die but that now
he was quite well and that he was not going to give up Garin any more
to anybody under the rank of Beelzebub

Then he said he felt hungry and thirsty and happy

We went down to tea at the resthouse where Stanley stuffed himself
with sardines and raspberry jam and beer and cold mutton and pickles
when Garm wasnt climbing over him and then Vixen and I went on

Garm saw how it was at once He said goodbye to me three times giving
me both paws one after another and leaping on to my shoulder He
further escorted us singing Hosannas at the top of his voice a mile
down the road Then he raced back to his own master

Vixen never opened her mouth but when the cold twilight came and we
could see the lights of Simla across the hills she snuffled with her
nose at the breast of my ulster I unbuttoned it and tucked her inside
Then she gave a contented little sniff and fell fast asleep her head
on my breast till we bundled out at Simla two of the four happiest
people in all the world that night




THE POWER OF THE DOG

 There is sorrow enough in the natural way
 From men and women to fill our day
 But when we are certain of sorrow in store
 Why do we always arrange for more
 Brothers and sisters I bid you beware
 Of giving your heart to a dog to tear

 Buy a pup and your money will buy
 Love unflinching that cannot lie
 Perfect passion and worship fed
 By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head
 Nevertheless it is hardly fair
 To risk your heart for a dog to tear

 When the fourteen years which Nature permits
 Are closing in asthma or tumour or fits
 And the vets unspoken prescription runs
 To lethal chambers or loaded guns
 Then you will findits your own affair
 But youve given your heart to a dog to tear

 When the body that lived at your single will
 When the whimper of welcome is stilled how still
 When the spirit that answered your every mood
 Is gone wherever it goesfor good
 You will discover how much you care
 And will give your heart to a dog to tear

 Weve sorrow enough in the natural way
 When it comes to burying Christian clay
 Our loves are not given but only lent
 At compound interest of cent per cent
 Though it is not always the case I believe
 That the longer weve kept em the more do we grieve
 For when debts are payable right or wrong
 A shorttime loan is as bad as a long
 So why in Heaven before we are there
 Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear




THE MOTHER HIVE

If the stock had not been old and overcrowded the Waxmoth would never
have entered but where bees are too thick on the comb there must be
sickness or parasites The heat of the hive had risen with the June
honeyflow and though the farmers worked until their wings ached to
keep people cool everybody suffered

A young bee crawled up the greasy trampled alightingboard Excuse me
she began but its my first honeyflight Could you kindly tell me if
this is my

own hive the Guard snapped Yes Buzz in and be foulbrooded to
you Next

Shame cried half a dozen old workers with worn wings and nerves and
there was a scuffle and a hum

The little grey Waxmoth pressed close in a crack in the
alightingboard had waited this chance all day She scuttled in like a
ghost and knowing the senior bees would turn her out at once dodged
into a broodframe where youngsters who had not yet seen the winds blow
or the flowers nod discussed life Here she was safe for young bees
will tolerate any sort of stranger Behind her came the bee who had been
slanged by the Guard

What is the world like Melissa said a companion Cruel I brought
in a full load of firstclass stuff and the Guard told me to go and be
foulbrooded She sat down in the cool draught across the combs

If youd only heard said the Waxmoth silkily the insolence of
the Guards tone when she cursed our sister It aroused the Entire
Community She laid an egg She had stolen in for that purpose

There was a bit of a fuss on the Gate Melissa chuckled You were
there Miss She did not know how to address the slim stranger

Dont call me Miss Im a sister to all in afflictionjust a
workingsister My heart bled for you beneath your burden The Waxmoth
caressed Melissa with her soft feelers and laid another egg

You mustnt lay here cried Melissa You arent a Queen

My dear child I give you my most solemn word of honour those arent
eggs Those are my principles and I am ready to die for them She
raised her voice a little above the rustle and tramp round her If
youd like to kill me pray do

Dont be unkind Melissa said a young bee impressed by the chaste
folds of the Waxmoths wing which hid her ceaseless eggdropping

I havent done anything Melissa answered Shes doing it all

Ah dont let your conscience reproach you later but when youve
killed me write me at least as one that loved her fellowworker

Laying at every sob the Waxmoth backed into a crowd of young bees and
left Melissa bewildered and annoyed So she lifted up her little voice
in the darkness and cried Stores till a gang of cellfillers hailed
her and she left her load with them

Im afraid I foulbrooded you just now said a voice over her
shoulder Id been on the Gate for three hours and one would
foulbrood the Queen herself after that No offence meant

None taken Melissa answered cheerily I shall be on Guard myself
some day Whats next to do

Theres a rumour of Deaths Head Moths about Send a gang of youngsters
to the Gate and tell them to narrow it in with a couple of stout
scrapwax pillars Itll make the Hive hot but we cant have Deaths
Headers in the middle of our honeyflow

My Only Wings I should think not Melissa had all a sound bees
hereditary hatred against the big squeaking feathery Thief of the
Hives Tumble out she called across the youngsters quarters All
you who arent feeding babies show a leg Scrapwax pillars for the
Gaate She chanted the order at length

Thats nonsense a downy dayold bee answered In the first place I
never heard of a Deaths Header coming into a hive People dont do
such things In the second building pillars to keep em out is purely
a Cypriote trick unworthy of British bees In the third if you trust
a Deaths Head he will trust you Pillarbuilding shows lack of
confidence Our dear sister in grey says so

Yes Pillars are unEnglish and provocative and a waste of wax that
is needed for higher and more practical ends said the Waxmoth from an
empty storecell

The safety of the Hive is the highest thing Ive ever heard of You
mustnt teach us to refuse work Melissa began

You misunderstand me as usual love Works the essence of life
but to expend precious unreturning vitality and real labour against
imaginary danger that is heartbreakingly absurd If I can only teach
aa little tolerationa little ordinary kindness here toward that
absurd old bogey you call the Deaths Header I shant have lived in
vain

She hasnt lived in vain the darling cried twenty bees together
You should see her saintly life Melissa She just devotes herself to
spreading her principles andandshe looks lovely

An old baldish bee came up the comb

Pillarworkers for the Gate Get out and chew scraps Buzz off she
said The Waxmoth slipped aside

The young bees trooped down the frame whispering Whats the matter
with em said the oldster Why do they call each other ducky and
darling Must be the weather She sniffed suspiciously Horrid
stuffy smell here Like stale quilts Not Waxmoth I hope Melissa

Not to my knowledge said Melissa who of course only knew the
Waxmoth as a lady with principles and had never thought to report
her presence She had always imagined Waxmoths to be like bloodred
dragonflies

You had better fan out this corner for a little said the old bee and
passed on Melissa dropped her head at once took firm hold with her
forefeet and fanned obediently at the regulation stroke three hundred
beats to the second Fanning tries a bees temper because she must
always keep in the same place where she never seems to be doing any
good and all the while she is wearing out her only wings When a bee
cannot fly a bee must not live and a bee knows it The Waxmoth crept
forth and caressed Melissa again

I see she murmured that at heart you are one of Us

I work with the Hive Melissa answered briefly

Its the same thing We and the Hive are one

Then why are your feelers different from ours Dont cuddle so

Dont be provincial Carissima You cant have all the world
alikeyet

But why do you lay eggs Melissa insisted You lay em like a
Queenonly you drop them in patches all over the place Ive watched
you

Ah Brighteyes so youve pierced my little subterfuge Yes they are
eggs By and by theyll spread our principles Arent you glad

You gave me your most solemn word of honour that they were not eggs

That was my little subterfuge dearestfor the sake of the Cause
Now I must reach the young The Waxmoth tripped towards the fourth
broodframe where the young bees were busy feeding the babies

It takes some time for a sound bee to realize a malignant and continuous
lie Shes very sweet and feathery was all that Melissa thought but
her talk sounds like ivy honey tastes Id better get to my fieldwork
again

She found the Gate in a sulky uproar The youngsters told off to the
pillars had refused to chew scrapwax because it made their jaws ache
and were clamouring for virgin stuff

Anything to finish the job said the badgered Guards Hang up some
of you and make wax for these slackjawed sisters

Before a bee can make wax she must fill herself with honey Then she
climbs to safe foothold and hangs while other gorged bees hang on to
her in a cluster There they wait in silence till the wax comes The
scales are either taken out of the makers pockets by the workers or
tinkle down on the workers while they wait The workers chew them they
are useless unchewed into the allsupporting allembracing Wax of the
Hive

But now no sooner was the waxcluster in position than the workers
below broke out again

Come down they cried Come down and work Come on you Levantine
parasites Dont think to enjoy yourselves up there while were sweating
down here

The cluster shivered as from hooked forefoot to hooked hindfoot it
telegraphed uneasiness At last a worker sprang up grabbed the lowest
waxmaker and swung kicking above her companions

I can make wax too she bawled Give me a full gorge and Ill make
tons of it

Make it then said the bee she had grappled The spoken word snapped
the current through the cluster It shook and glistened like a cats fur
in the dark Unhook it murmured No wax for any one today

You lazy thieves Hang up at once and produce our wax said the bees
below

Impossible The sweats gone To make your wax we must have stillness
warmth and food Unhook Unhook

They broke up as they murmured and disappeared among the other bees
from whom of course they were undistinguishable

Seems as if wed have to chew scrapwax for these pillars after all
said a worker

Not by a whole comb cried the young bee who had broken the cluster
Listen here Ive studied the question more than twenty minutes Its
as simple as falling off a daisy Youve heard of Cheshire Root and
Langstroth

They had not but they shouted Good old Langstroth just the same

Those three know all that there is to be known about making hives One
or tother of em must have made ours and if theyve made it theyre
bound to look after it Ours is a Guaranteed Patent Hive You can see
it on the label behind

Good old guarantee Hurrah for the label behind roared the bees

Well such being the case I say that when we find theyve betrayed us
we can exact from them a terrible vengeance

Good old vengeance Good old Root Nuff said Chuck it The crowd
cheered and broke away as Melissa dived through

Dyou know where Langstroth Root and Cheshire live if you happen to
want em she asked of the proud panting orator

Gum me if I know they ever lived at all But arent they beautiful
names to buzz about Did you see how it worked up the sisterhood

Yes but it didnt defend the Gate she replied

Ah perhaps thats true but think how delicate my position is sister
Ive a magnificent appetite and I dont like working Its bad for the
mind My instinct tells me that I can act as a restraining influence on
others They would have been worse but for me

But Melissa had already risen clear and was heading for a breadth of
virgin white clover which to an overtired bee is as soothing as plain
knitting to a woman

I think Ill take this load to the nurseries she said when she had
finished It was always quiet there in my day and she topped off with
two little pats of pollen for the babies

She was met on the fourth broodcomb by a rush of excited sisters all
buzzing together

One at a time Let me put down my load Now what is it Sacharissa
she said

Grey Sisterthat fluffy one I meanshe came and said we ought to be
out in the sunshine gathering honey because life was short She said
any old bee could attend to our babies and some day old bees would
That isnt true Melissa is it No old bees can take us away from our
babies can they

Of course not You feed the babies while your heads are soft When your
heads harden you go on to fieldwork Any one knows that

We told her so We told her so but she only waved her feelers and
said we could all lay eggs like Queens if we chose And Im afraid
lots of the weaker sisters believe her and are trying to do it So
unsettling

Sacharissa sped to a sealed workercell whose lid pulsated as the bee
within began to cut its way out

Come along precious she murmured and thinned the frail top from the
other side A pale damp creased thing hoisted itself feebly on to the
comb Sacharissas note changed at once No time to waste Go up the
frame and preen yourself she said Report for nursingduty in my ward
tomorrow evening at six Stop a minute Whats the matter with your
third right leg

The young bee held it out in silenceunmistakably a drone leg incapable
of packing pollen

Thank you You neednt report till the day after tomorrow Sacharissa
turned to her companion Thats the fifth oddity hatched in my ward
since noon I dont like it

Theres always a certain number of em said Melissa You cant stop
a few working sisters from laying now and then when they overfeed
themselves They only raise dwarf drones

But were hatching out drones with workers stomachs workers with
drones stomachs and albinoes and mixedleggers who cant pack
pollenlike that poor little beast yonder I dont mind dwarf drones
any more than you do they all die in July but this steady hatch of
oddities frightens me Melissa

How narrow of you They are all so delightfully clever and unusual and
interesting piped the Waxmoth from a crack above them Come here
you dear downy duck and tell us all about your feelings

I wish shed go Sacharissa lowered her voice She meets
theseeroddities as they dry out and cuddles em in corners

I suppose the truth is that were overstocked and too well fed to
swarm said Melissa

That is the truth said the Queens voice behind them They had
not heard the heavy royal footfall which sets empty cells vibrating
Sacharissa offered her food at once She ate and dragged her weary body
forward Can you suggest a remedy she said

New principles cried the Waxmoth from her crevice Well apply them
quietly later

Suppose we sent out a swarm Melissa suggested Its a little late
but it might ease us off

It would save us butI know the Hive You shall see for yourself
The old Queen cried the Swarming Cry which to a bee of good blood
should be what the trumpet was to Jobs warhorse In spite of her
immense age three years it rang between the canonlike frames as a
pibroch rings in a mountain pass the fanners changed their note and
repeated it up in every gallery and the broadwinged drones burly and
eager ended it on one nervethrilling outbreak of bugles La Reine le
veult Swarm Swarrm Swarrrm

But the roar which should follow the Call was wanting They heard a
broken grumble like the murmur of a falling tide

Swarm What for Catch me leaving a good barframe Hive with fixed
foundations for a rotten old oak out in the open where it may rain any
minute Were all right Its a Patent Guaranteed Hive Why do they
want to turn us out Swarming be gummed Swarming was invented to cheat
a worker out of her proper comforts Come on off to bed

The noise died out as the bees settled in empty cells for the night

You hear said the Queen I know the Hive

Quite between ourselves I taught them that cried the Waxmoth
Wait till my principles develop and youll see the light from a new
quarter

You speak truth for once the Queen said suddenly for she recognized
the Waxmoth That Light will break into the top of the Hive A Hot
Smoke will follow it and your children will not be able to hide in any
crevice

Is it possible Melissa whispered Iwe have sometimes heard a legend
like it

It is no legend the old Queen answered I had it from my mother and
she had it from hers After the Waxmoth has grown strong a Shadow will
fall across the gate a Voice will speak from behind a Veil there will
be Light and Hot Smoke and earthquakes and those who live will see
everything that they have done all together in one place burned up in
one great fire The old Queen was trying to tell what she had been told
of the Bee Masters dealings with an infected hive in the apiary two or
three seasons ago and of course from her point of view the affair was
as important as the Day of Judgment

And then asked horrified Sacharissa

Then I have heard that a little light will burn in a great darkness
and perhaps the world will begin again Myself I think not

Tut Tut the Waxmoth cried You good fat people always prophesy
ruin if things dont go exactly your way But I grant you there will be
changes

There were When her eggs hatched the wax was riddled with little
tunnels coated with the dirty clothes of the caterpillars Flannelly
lines ran through the honeystores the pollenlarders the foundations
and worst of all through the babies in their cradles till the Sweeper
Guards spent half their time tossing out useless little corpses The
lines ended in a maze of sticky webbing on the face of the comb The
caterpillars could not stop spinning as they walked and as they walked
everywhere they smarmed and garmed everything Even where it did not
hamper the bees feet the stale sour smell of the stuff put them off
their work though some of the bees who had taken to egg laying said it
encouraged them to be mothers and maintain a vital interest in life

When the caterpillars became moths they made friends with the
everincreasing Odditiesalbinoes mixedleggers singleeyed
composites faceless drones halfqueens and laying sisters and
the everdwindling band of the old stock worked themselves bald and
fraywinged to feed their queer charges Most of the Oddities would not
and many on account of their malformations could not go through
a days fieldwork but the Waxmoths who were always busy on the
broodcomb found pleasant home occupations for them One albino for
instance divided the number of pounds of honey in stock by the number
of bees in the Hive and proved that if every bee only gathered honey
for seven and three quarter minutes a day she would have the rest of
the time to herself and could accompany the drones on their mating
flights The drones were not at all pleased

Another an eyeless drone with no feelers said that all broodcells
should be perfect circles so as not to interfere with the grub or the
workers He proved that the old sixsided cell was solely due to the
workers building against each other on opposite sides of the wall and
that if there were no interference there would be no angles Some bees
tried the new plan for a while and found it cost eight times more
wax than the old six sided specification and as they never allowed a
cluster to hang up and make wax in peace real wax was scarce However
they eked out their task with varnish stolen from new coffins at
funerals and it made them rather sick Then they took to cadging round
sugarfactories and breweries because it was easiest to get their
material from those places and the mixture of glucose and beer
naturally fermented in store and blew the storecells out of shape
besides smelling abominably Some of the sound bees warned them that
illgotten gains never prosper but the Oddities at once surrounded them
and balled them to death That was a punishment they were almost as
fond of as they were of eating and they expected the sound bees to
feed them Curiously enough the ageold instinct of loyalty and devotion
towards the Hive made the sound bees do this though their reason told
them they ought to slip away and unite with some other healthy stock in
the apiary

What about seven and threequarter minutes work now said Melissa
one day as she came in Ive been at it for five hours and Ive only
half a load

Oh the Hive subsists on the Hival Honey which the Hive produces said
a blind Oddity squatting in a storecell

But honey is gathered from flowers outside two miles away sometimes
cried Melissa

Pardon me said the blind thing sucking hard But this is the Hive
is it not

It was Worse luck it is

And the Hival Honey is here is it not It opened a fresh storecell
to prove it

Yees but it wont be long at this rate said Melissa

The rates have nothing to do with it This Hive produces the Hival
Honey You people never seem to grasp the economic simplicity that
underlies all life

Oh me said poor Melissa havent you ever been beyond the Gate

Certainly not A fools eyes are in the ends of the earth Mine are in
my head It gorged till it bloated

Melissa took refuge in her poorly paid fieldwork and told Sacharissa
the story

Hut said that wise bee fretting with an old maid of a thistle Tell
us something new The Hives full of such as himit I mean

Whats the end to be All the honey going out and none coming in
Things cant last this way said Melissa

Who cares said Sacharissa I know now how drones feel the day before
theyre killed A short life and a merry one for me

If it only were merry But think of those awful solemn lopsided
Oddities waiting for us at home crawling and clambering and
preachingand dirtying things in the dark

I dont mind that so much as their silly songs after weve fed em
all about work among the merry merry blossoms said Sacharissa from
the deeps of a stale Canterbury bell

I do Hows our Queen said Melissa

Cheerfully hopeless as usual But she lays an egg now and then

Does she so Melissa backed out of the next bell with a jerk Suppose
now we sound workers tried to raise a Princess in some clean corner

Youd be put to it to find one The Hives all Waxmoth and muckings
Butwell

A Princess might help us in the time of the Voice behind the Veil that
the Queen talks of And anything is better than working for Oddities
that chirrup about work that they cant do and waste what we bring
home

Who cares said Sacharissa Im with you for the fun of it The
Oddities would ball us to death if they knew Come home and well
begin

There is no room to tell how the experienced Melissa found a faroff
frame so messed and mishandled by abandoned cellbuilding experiments
that for very shame the bees never went there How in that ruin she
blocked out a Royal Cell of sound wax but disguised by rubbish till it
looked like a kopje among deserted kopjes How she prevailed upon the
hopeless Queen to make one last effort and lay a worthy egg How the
Queen obeyed and died How her spent carcass was flung out on the
rubbish heap and how a multitude of laying sisters went about dropping
droneeggs where they listed and said there was no more need of Queens
How covered by this confusion Sacharissa educated certain young bees
to educate certain newborn bees in the almost lost art of making Royal
Jelly How the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill
winds How the hidden egg hatched trueno drone but Blood Royal How
it was capped and how desperately they worked to feed and doublefeed
the now swarming Oddities lest any break in the foodsupplies should
set them to instituting inquiries which with songs about work was
their favourite amusement How in an auspicious hour on a moonless
night the Princess came forth a Princess indeed and how Melissa
smuggled her into a dark empty honeymagazine to bide her time and
how the drones knowing she was there went about singing the deep
disreputable lovesongs of the old daysto the scandal of the laying
sisters who do not think well of drones These things are written
in the Book of Queens which is laid up in the hollow of the Great Ash
Ygdrasil

After a few days the weather changed again and became glorious Even the
Oddities would now join the crowd that hung out on the alightingboard
and would sing of work among the merry merry blossoms till an untrained
ear might have received it for the hum of a working hive Yet in truth
their storehoney had been eaten long ago They lived from day to day
on the efforts of the few sound bees while the Waxmoth fretted and
consumed again their already ruined wax But the sound bees never
mentioned these matters They knew if they did the Oddities would hold
a meeting and ball them to death

Now you see what we have done said the Waxmoths We have created
New Material a New Convention a New Type as we said we would

And new possibilities for us said the laying sisters gratefully You
have given us a new lifes work vital and paramount

More than that chanted the Oddities in the sunshine you have
created a new heaven and a new earth Heaven cloudless and accessible
it was a perfect August evening and Earth teeming with the merry
merry blossoms waiting only our honest toil to turn them all to good
TheerAster and the Crocus and theerLadies Smock in her
season the Chrysanthemum after her kind and the Guelder Rose bringing
forth abundantly withal

Oh Holy Hymettus said Melissa awestruck I knew they didnt know
how honey was made but theyve forgotten the Order of the Flowers What
will become of them

A Shadow fell across the alightingboard as the Bee Master and his son
came by The Oddities crawled in and a Voice behind a Veil said Ive
neglected the old Hive too long Give me the smoker

Melissa heard and darted through the gate Come oh come she cried
It is the destruction the Old Queen foretold Princess come

Really you are too archaic for words said an Oddity in an alleyway
A cloud I admit may have crossed the sun but why hysterics Above
all why Princesses so late in the day Are you aware its the Hival
Teatime Lets sing grace

Melissa clawed past him with all six legs Sacharissa had run to what
was left of the fertile broodcomb Down and out she called across
the brown breadth of it Nurses guards fanners sweepersout

Never mind the babies Theyre better deadOut before the Light and
the Hot Smoke

The Princesss first clear fearless call Melissa had found her rose
and drummed through all the frames La Reine le veult Swarm Swarrm
Swarrrm

The Hive shook beneath the shattering thunder of a stuckdown quilt
being torn back

Dont be alarmed dears said the Waxmoths Thats our work Look
up and youll see the dawn of the New Day

Light broke in the top of the hive as the Queen had prophesiednaked
light on the boiling bewildered bees

Sacharissa rounded up her rearguard which dropped headlong off the
frame and joined the Princesss detachment thrusting toward the Gate
Now panic was in full blast and each sound bee found herself embraced
by at least three Oddities The first instinct of a frightened bee is
to break into the stores and gorge herself with honey but there were no
stores left so the Oddities fought the sound bees

You must feed us or we shall die they cried holding and clutching
and slipping while the silent scared earwigs and little spiders twisted
between their legs Think of the Hive traitors The Holy Hive

You should have thought before cried the sound bees Stay and see
the dawn of your New Day

They reached the Gate at last over the soft bodies of many to whom they
had ministered

On Out Up roared Melissa in the Princesss ear For the Hives
sake To the Old Oak

The Princess left the alightingboard circled once flung herself at
the lowest branch of the Old Oak and her little loyal swarmyou could
have covered it with a pint mugfollowed hooked and hung

Hold close Melissa gasped The old legends have come true Look

The Hive was half hidden by smoke and Figures moved through the smoke
They heard a frame crack stickily saw it heaved high and twirled round
between enormous handsa blotched bulged and perished horror of grey
wax corrupt brood and small dronecells all covered with crawling
Oddities strange to the sun

Why this isnt a hive This is a museum of curiosities said the
Voice behind the Veil It was only the Bee Master talking to his son

Can you blame em father said a second voice Its rotten with
Waxmoth See here

Another frame came up A finger poked through it and it broke away in
rustling flakes of ashy rottenness

Number Four Frame That was your mothers pet comb once whispered
Melissa to the Princess Manys the good egg Ive watched her lay
there

Arent you confusing pod hoc with propter hoc said the Bee Master
Waxmoth only succeed when weak bees let them in A third frame
crackled and rose into the light All this is full of laying workers
brood That never happens till the stocks weakened Phew

He beat it on his knee like a tambourine and it also crumbled to
pieces

The little swarm shivered as they watched the dwarf dronegrubs squirm
feebly on the grass Many sound bees had nursed on that frame well
knowing their work was useless but the actual sight of even useless
work destroyed disheartens a good worker

No they have some recuperative power left said the second voice
Heres a Queen cell

But its tucked away amongWhat on earth has come to the little
wretches They seem to have lost the instinct of cellbuilding The
father held up the frame where the bees had experimented in circular
cellwork It looked like the pitted head of a decaying toadstool

Not altogether the son corrected Theres one line at least of
perfectly good cells

My work said Sacharissa to herself Im glad Man does me justice
before

That frame too was smashed out and thrown atop of the others and the
foul earwiggy quilts

As frame after frame followed it the swarm beheld the upheaval
exposure and destruction of all that had been well or ill done in every
cranny of their Hive for generations past There was black comb so old
that they had forgotten where it hung orange buff and ochrevarnished
storecomb built as bees were used to build before the days of
artificial foundations and there was a little white frail new work
There were sheets on sheets of level even broodcomb that had held in
its time unnumbered thousands of unnamed workers patches of obsolete
dronecomb broad and highshouldered showing to what marks the male
grub was expected to grow and twoinch deep honeymagazines empty but
still magnificent the whole gummed and glued into twisted scrapwork
awry on the wires halfcells beginnings abandoned or grandiose
weakwalled composite cells pieced out with rubbish and capped with
dirt

Good or bad every inch of it was so riddled by the tunnels of the
Waxmoth that it broke in clouds of dust as it was flung on the heap

Oh see cried Sacharissa The Great Burning that Our Queen foretold
Who can bear to look

A flame crawled up the pile of rubbish and they smelt singeing wax

The Figures stooped lifted the Hive and shook it upside down over the
pyre A cascade of Oddities chips of broken comb scale fluff and
grubs slid out crackled sizzled popped a little and then the flames
roared up and consumed all that fuel

We must disinfect said a Voice Get me a sulphurcandle please

The shell of the Hive was returned to its place a light was set in
its sticky emptiness tier by tier the Figures built it up closed the
entrance and went away The swarm watched the light leaking through
the cracks all the long night At dawn one Waxmoth came by fluttering
impudently

There has been a miscalculation about the New Day my dears she
began one cant expect people to be perfect all at once That was our
mistake

No the mistake was entirely ours said the Princess

Pardon me said the Waxmoth When you think of the enormous
upheavalcall it good or badwhich our influence brought about you
will admit that we and we alone

You said the Princess Our stock was not strong So you cameas any
other disease might have come Hang close all my people

When the sun rose Veiled Figures came down and saw their swarm at the
boughs end waiting patiently within sight of the old Hivea handful
but prepared to go on




THE BEES AND THE FLIES

 A FARMER of the Augustan age
 Perused in Virgils golden page
 The story of the secret won
 From Proteus by Cyrenes son
 How the dank seagod sowed the swain
 Means to restore his hives again
 More briefly how a slaughtered bull
 Breeds honey by the bellyful

 The egregious rustic put to death
 A bull by stopping of its breath
 Disposed the carcass in a shed
 With fragrant herbs and branches spread
 And having thus performed the charm
 Sat down to wait the promised swarm

 Nor waited long The God of Day
 Impartial quickening with his ray
 Evil and good alike beheld
 The carcassand the carcass swelled
 Big with new birth the belly heaves
 Beneath its screen of scented leaves
 Past any doubt the bull conceives

 The farmer bids men bring more hives
 To house the profit that arrives
 Prepares on pan and key and kettle
 Sweet music that shall make em settle
 But when to crown the work he goes
 Gods What a stink salutes his nose
 Where are the honest toilers
 Where The gravid mistress of their care
 A busy scene indeed he sees
 But not a sign or sound of bees
 Worms of the riper grave unhid
 By any kindly coffin lid
 Obscene and shameless to the light
 Seethe in insatiate appetite
 Through putrid offal while above
 The hissing blowfly seeks his love
 Whose offspring supping where they supt
 Consume corruption twice corrupt




WITH THE NIGHT MAIL

A STORY OF 2000 A D

Together with extracts from the magazine in which it appeared

A nine oclock of a gusty winter night I stood on the lower stages of
one of the GPO outward mail towers My purpose was a run to Quebec
in Postal Packet 162 or such other as may be appointed and the
PostmasterGeneral himself countersigned the order This talisman opened
all doors even those in the despatchingcaisson at the foot of the
tower where they were delivering the sorted Continental mail The bags
lay packed close as herrings in the long grey underbodies which our
GPO still calls coaches Five such coaches were filled as I
watched and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting
packets three hundred feet nearer the stars

From the despatchingcaisson I was conducted by a courteous and
wonderfully learned official Mr LL Geary Second Despatcher of
the Western Routeto the Captains Room this wakes an echo of old
romance where the mail captains come on for their turn of duty He
introduces me to the captain of 162Captain Purnall and his relief
Captain Hodgson The one is small and dark the other large and red
but each has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and
aeronauts You can see it in the pictures of our racing professionals
from LV Rautsch to little Ada Warrleighthat fathomless abstraction
of eyes habitually turned through naked space

On the noticeboard in the Captains Room the pulsing arrows of some
twenty indicators register degree by geographical degree the progress
of as many homewardbound packets The word Cape rises across the face
of a dial a gong strikes the South African midweekly mail is in at
the Highgate Receiving Towers That is all It reminds one comically of
the traitorous little bell which in pigeonfanciers lofts notifies the
return of a homer

Time for us to be on the move says Captain Purnall and we are shot
up by the passengerlift to the top of the despatchtowers Our coach
will lock on when it is filled and the clerks are aboard

No 162 waits for us in Slip E of the topmost stage The great curve
of her back shines frostily under the lights and some minute alteration
of trim makes her rock a little in her holdingdown slips

Captain Purnall frowns and dives inside Hissing softly 162 comes to
rest as level as a rule From her North Atlantic Winter nosecap worn
bright as diamond with boring through uncounted leagues of hail snow
and ice to the inset of her three built out propellershafts is some
two hundred and forty feet Her extreme diameter carried well forward
is thirtyseven Contrast this with the nine hundred by ninetyfive of
any crack liner and you will realize the power that must drive a hull
through all weathers at more than the emergency speed of the Cyclonic

The eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping
haircrack of the bowrudderMagniacs rudder that assured us the
dominion of the unstable air and left its inventor penniless and
halfblind It is calculated to Castellis gullwing curve Raise a few
feet of that all but invisible plate threeeighths of an inch and she
will yaw five miles to port or starboard ere she is under control again
Give her full helm and she returns on her track like a whiplash Cant
the whole forwarda touch on the wheel will sufficeand she sweeps
at your good direction up or down Open the complete circle and she
presents to the air a mushroomhead that will bring her up all standing
within a half mile

Yes says Captain Hodgson answering my thought Castelli thought
hed discovered the secret of controlling aeroplanes when hed only
found out how to steer dirigible balloons Magniac invented his rudder
to help warboats ram each other and war went out of fashion and
Magniac he went out of his mind because he said he couldnt serve his
country any more I wonder if any of us ever know what were really
doing

If you want to see the coach locked youd better go aboard Its due
now says Mr Geary I enter through the door amidships There is
nothing here for display The inner skin of the gastanks comes down to
within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of
the bilges Liners and yachts disguise their tanks with decoration
but the GPO serves them raw under a lick of grey official paint The
inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern
but the bowbulkhead is recessed for the liftshunting apparatus as
the stern is pierced for the shafttunnels The engineroom lies almost
amidships Forward of it extending to the turn of the bow tanks is an
aperturea bottomless hatch at presentinto which our coach will
be locked One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to
the despatchingcaisson whence voices boom upward The light below is
obscured to a sound of thunder as our coach rises on its guides It
enlarges rapidly from a postagestamp to a playingcard to a punt and
last a pontoon The two clerks its crew do not even look up as it
comes into place The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap
into the docketed racks while both captains and Mr Geary satisfy them
selves that the coach is locked home A clerk passes the waybill over
the hatch coaming Captain Purnall thumbmarks and passes it to Mr
Geary Receipt has been given and taken Pleasant run says Mr Geary
and disappears through the door which a foot high pneumatic compressor
locks after him

Aah sighs the compressor released Our holdingdown clips part with
a tang We are clear

Captain Hodgson opens the great colloid underbody porthole through which
I watch overlighted London slide eastward as the gale gets hold of
us The first of the low winter clouds cuts off the wellknown view and
darkens Middlesex On the south edge of it I can see a postal packets
light ploughing through the white fleece For an instant she gleams like
a star ere she drops toward the Highgate Receiving Towers The Bombay
Mail says Captain Hodgson and looks at his watch Shes forty
minutes late

Whats our level I ask

Four thousand Arent you coming up on the bridge

The bridge let us ever praise the GPO as a repository of ancientest
tradition is represented by a view of Captain Hodgsons legs where he
stands on the Control Platform that runs thwartships overhead The bow
colloid is unshuttered and Captain Purnall one hand on the wheel
is feeling for a fair slant The dial shows 4300 feet Its steep
tonight he mutters as tier on tier of cloud drops under We
generally pick up an easterly draught below three thousand at this time
o the year I hate slathering through fluff

So does Van Cutsem Look at him huntin for a slant says Captain
Hodgson A foglight breaks cloud a hundred fathoms below The Antwerp
Night Mail makes her signal and rises between two racing clouds far to
port her flanks bloodred in the glare of Sheerness Double Light
The gale will have us over the North Sea in halfanhour but Captain
Purnall lets her go composedlynosing to every point of the compass as
she rises

Five thousandsix six thousand eight hundredthe dipdial reads ere
we find the easterly drift heralded by a flurry of snow at the thousand
fathom level Captain Purnall rings up the engines and keys down the
governor on the switch before him There is no sense in urging machinery
when Eolus himself gives you good knots for nothing We are away in
earnest nowour nose notched home on our chosen star At this level the
lower clouds are laid out all neatly combed by the dry fingers of the
East Below that again is the strong westerly blow through which we
rose Overhead a film of southerly drifting mist draws a theatrical
gauze across the firmament The moonlight turns the lower strata to
silver without a stain except where our shadow underruns us Bristol and
Cardiff Double Lights those statelily inclined beams over Severnmouth
are dead ahead of us for we keep the Southern Winter Route Coventry
Central the pivot of the English system stabs upward once in ten
seconds its spear of diamond light to the north and a point or two off
our starboard bow The Leek the great cloudbreaker of Saint Davids
Head swings its unmistakable green beam twentyfive degrees each way
There must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather but it does
not affect The Leek

Our planets overlighted if anything says Captain Purnall at the
wheel as CardiffBristol slides under I remember the old days of
common white verticals that ud show two or three hundred feet up in a
mist if you knew where to look for em In really fluffy weather they
might as well have been under your hat One could get lost coming home
then an have some fun Now its like driving down Piccadilly

He points to the pillars of light where the cloudbreakers bore through
the cloudfloor We see nothing of Englands outlines only a white
pavement pierced in all directions by these manholes of variously
coloured fireHoly Islands white and redSt Bees interrupted white
and so on as far as the eye can reach Blessed be Sargent Ahrens
and the Dubois brothers who invented the cloudbreakers of the world
whereby we travel in security

Are you going to lift for The Shamrock asks Captain Hodgson Cork
Light green fixed enlarges as we rush to it Captain Purnall
nods There is heavy traffic hereaboutsthe cloudbank beneath us is
streaked with running fissures of flame where the Atlantic boats are
hurrying Londonward just clear of the fluff Mailpackets are supposed
under the Conference rules to have the fivethousandfoot lanes to
themselves but the foreigner in a hurry is apt to take liberties with
English air No 162 lifts to a longdrawn wail of the breeze in the
foreflange of the rudder and we make Valencia white green white at
a safe 7000 feet dipping our beam to an incoming Washington packet

There is no cloud on the Atlantic and faint streaks of cream round
Dingle Bay show where the driven seas hammer the coast A big SATA
liner Societe Anonyme des Transports Aeriens is diving and lifting
half a mile below us in search of some break in the solid west wind
Lower still lies a disabled Dane she is telling the liner all about it
in International Our General Communication dial has caught her talk and
begins to eavesdrop Captain Hodgson makes a motion to shut it off but
checks himself Perhaps youd like to listen he says

Argol of St Thomas the Dane whimpers Report owners three starboard
shaft collarbearings fused Can make Flores as we are but impossible
further Shall we buy spares at Fayal

The liner acknowledges and recommends inverting the bearings The Argol
answers that she has already done so without effect and begins to
relieve her mind about cheap German enamels for collarbearings The
Frenchman assents cordially cries Courage mon ami and switches off

Then lights sink under the curve of the ocean

Thats one of Lundt  Bleamers boats says Captain Hodgson Serves
em right for putting German compos in their thrustblocks She wont
be in Fayal tonight By the way wouldnt you like to look round the
engineroom

I have been waiting eagerly for this invitation and I follow Captain
Hodgson from the controlplatform stooping low to avoid the bulge
of the tanks We know that Fleurys gas can lift anything as the
worldfamous trials of 89 showed but its almost indefinite powers
of expansion necessitate vast tank room Even in this thin air the
liftshunts are busy taking out onethird of its normal lift and still
162 must be checked by an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our
flight would become a climb to the stars Captain Purnall prefers an
overlifted to an underlifted ship but no two captains trim ship alike
When I take the bridge says Captain Hodgson youll see me shunt
forty per cent of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper
rudder With a swoop upward instead of a swoop downward as you say
Either way will do Its only habit Watch our dipdial Tim fetches her
down once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing

So is it shown on the dipdial For five or six minutes the arrow creeps
from 6700 to 7300 There is the faint szgee of the rudder and back
slides the arrow to 6000 on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots

In heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well says Captain
Hodgson and unclipping the jointed bar which divides the engineroom
from the bare deck he leads me on to the floor Here we find Fleurys
Paradox of the Bulkheaded Vacuumwhich we accept now without
thoughtliterally in full blast The three engines are HTT
assistedvacuo Fleury turbines running from 3000 to the Limitthat is
to say up to the point when the blades make the air bellcut out a
vacuum for themselves precisely as overdriven marine propellers used
to do 162s Limit is low on account of the small size of her nine
screws which though handier than the old colloid Thelussons bell
sooner The midships engine generally used as a reinforce is not
running so the port and starboard turbine vacuumchambers draw direct
into the returnmains

The turbines whistle reflectively From the lowarched expansiontanks
on either side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbinechests
and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a
force that would whip the teeth out of a power saw Behind is its own
pressure held in leash of spurred on by the liftshunts before it
the vacuum where Fleurys Ray dances in violetgreen bands and whirled
turbillons of flame The jointed Utubes of the vacuumchamber are
pressuretempered colloid no glass would endure the strain for an
instant and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the Ray
intently It is the very heart of the machinea mystery to this day
Even Fleury who begat it and unlike Magniac died a multimillionaire
could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the Utube
can in the fractional fraction of a second strike the furious blast
of gas into a chill greyishgreen liquid that drains you can hear it
trickle from the far end of the vacuum through the eductionpipes and
the mains back to the bilges Here it returns to its gaseous one had
almost written sagacious state and climbs to work afresh Bilgetank
upper tank dorsaltank expansionchamber vacuum mainreturn as a
liquid and bilgetank once more is the ordained cycle Fleurys
Ray sees to that and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to
Fleurys Ray If a speck of oil if even the natural grease of the human
finger touch the hooded terminals Fleurys Ray will wink and disappear
and must be laboriously built up again This means half a days work for
all hands and an expense of one hundred and seventyodd pounds to the
GPO for radiumsalts and such trifles

Now look at our thrustcollars You wont find much German compo there
Fulljewelled you see says Captain Hodgson as the engineer shunts
open the top of a cap Our shaftbearings are CMC Commercial
Minerals Company stones ground with as much care as the lens of a
telescope They cost L837 apiece So far we have not arrived at their
term of life These bearings came from No 97 which took them over
from the old Dominion of Light which had them out of the wreck of the
Persew aeroplane in the years when men still flew wooden kites over oil
engines

They are a shining reproof to all lowgrade German ruby enamels
socalled boort facings and the dangerous and unsatisfactory alumina
compounds which please dividendhunting owners and turn skippers crazy
The ruddergear and the gas liftshunt seated side by side under the
engineroom dials are the only machines in visible motion The former
sighs from time to time as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch
The latter cased and guarded like the Utube aft exhibits another
Fleury Ray but inverted and more green than violet Its function is
to shunt the lift out of the gas and this it will do without watching
That is all A tiny pumprod wheezing and whining to itself beside a
sputtering green lamp A hundred and fifty feet aft down the flattopped
tunnel of the tanks a violet light restless and irresolute Between the
two three whitepainted turbinetrunks like eelbaskets laid on their
side accentuate the empty perspectives You can hear the trickle of the
liquefied gas flowing from the vacuum into the bilgetanks and the soft
gluckglock of gaslocks closing as Captain Purnall brings 162 down by
the head The hum of the turbines and the boom of the air on our skin is
no more than a cottonwool wrapping to the universal stillness And we
are running an eighteensecond mile

I peer from the fore end of the engineroom over the hatchcoamings
into the coach The mailclerks are sorting the Winnipeg Calgary and
Medicine Hat bags but there is a pack of cards ready on the table

Suddenly a bell thrills the engineers run to the turbinevalves and
stand by but the spectacled slave of the Ray in the Utube never
lifts his head He must watch where he is We are hardbraked and going
astern there is language from the Control Platform

Tims sparking badly about something says the unruffled Captain
Hodgson Lets look

Captain Purnall is not the suave man we left half an hour since but
the embodied authority of the GPO Ahead of us floats an ancient
aluminumpatched twinscrew tramp of the dingiest with no more right
to the 5000foot lane than has a horsecart to a modern road She
carries an obsolete barbette conning towera sixfoot affair with
railed platform forwardand our warning beam plays on the top of it
as a policemans lantern flashes on the area sneak Like a sneakthief
too emerges a shockheaded navigator in his shirtsleeves Captain
Purnall wrenches open the colloid to talk with him man to man There are
times when Science does not satisfy

What under the stars are you doing here you skyscraping
chimneysweep he shouts as we two drift side by side Do you know
this is a Maillane You call yourself a sailor sir You aint fit to
peddle toy balloons to an Esquimaux Your name and number Report and
get down and be

Ive been blown up once the shockheaded man cries hoarsely as a
dog barking I dont care two flips of a contact for anything you can
do Postey

Dont you sir But Ill make you care Ill have you towed stern first
to Disko and broke up You cant recover insurance if youre broke for
obstruction Do you understand that

Then the stranger bellows Look at my propellers Theres been a
wulliwa down below that has knocked us into umbrellaframes Weve
been blown up about forty thousand feet Were all one conjurors watch
inside My mates arms broke my engineers heads cut open my Ray
went out when the engines smashed and and for pitys sake give
me my height Captain We doubt were dropping

Six thousand eight hundred Can you hold it Captain Purnall overlooks
all insults and leans half out of the colloid staring and snuffing
The stranger leaks pungently

We ought to blow into St Johns with luck Were trying to plug the
foretank now but shes simply whistling it away her captain wails

Shes sinking like a log says Captain Purnall in an undertone Call
up the Banks Mark Boat George Our dipdial shows that we keeping
abreast the tramp have dropped five hundred feet the last few minutes

Captain Purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing
through the night twizzling spokes of light across infinity

Thatll fetch something he says while Captain Hodgson watches the
General Communicator He has called up the North Banks Mark Boat a few
hundred miles west and is reporting the case

Ill stand by you Captain Purnall roars to the lone figure on the
conningtower

Is it as bad as that comes the answer She isnt insured Shes
mine

Might have guessed as much mutters Hodgson Owners risk is the
worst risk of all

Cant I fetch St Johnsnot even with this breeze the voice
quavers

Stand by to abandon ship Havent you any lift in you fore or aft

Nothing but the midship tanks and theyre none too tight You see my
Ray gave out and he coughs in the reek of the escaping gas

You poor devil This does not reach our friend What does the Mark
Boat say George

Wants to know if theres any danger to traffic Says shes in a bit of
weather herself and cant quit station Ive turned in a General Call
so even if they dont see our beam some ones bound to helpor else we
must Shall I clear our slings Hold on Here we are A Planet liner
too Shell be up in a tick

Tell her to have her slings ready cries his brother captain There
wont be much time to spare Tie up your mate he roars to the
tramp

My mates all right Its my engineer Hes gone crazy

Shunt the lift out of him with a spanner Hurry

But I can make St Johns if youll stand by

Youll make the deep wet Atlantic in twenty minutes Youre less than
fiftyeight hundred now Get your papers

A Planet liner east bound heaves up in a superb spiral and takes
the air of us humming Her underbody colloid is open land her
transporterslings hang down like tentacles We shut off our beam as she
adjusts herselfsteering to a hairover the tramps conningtower
The mate comes up his arm strapped to his side and stumbles into the
cradle A man with a ghastly scarlet head follows shouting that he must
go back and build up his Ray The mate assures him that he will find
a nice new Ray all ready in the liners engineroom The bandaged head
goes up wagging excitedly A youth and a woman follow The liner cheers
hollowly above us and we see the passengers faces at the saloon
colloid

Thats a pretty girl Whats the fool waiting for now says Captain
Purnall

The skipper comes up still appealing to us to stand by and see him
fetch St Johns He dives below and returnsat which we little human
beings in the void cheer louder than everwith the ships kitten
Up fly the liners hissing slings her underbody crashes home and she
hurtles away again The dial shows less than 3000 feet The Mark Boat
signals we must attend to the derelict now whistling her deathsong as
she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags

Keep our beam on her and send out a General Warning says Captain
Purnall following her down There is no need Not a liner in air but
knows the meaning of that vertical beam and gives us and our quarry a
wide berth

But shell drown in the water wont she I ask Not always is
his answer Ive known a derelict upend and sift her engines out of
herself and flicker round the Lower Lanes for three weeks on her forward
tanks only Well run no risks Pith her George and look sharp
Theres weather ahead

Captain Hodgson opens the underbody colloid swings the heavy
pithingiron out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a
smokingroom settee and at two hundred feet releases the catch We
hear the whir of the crescentshaped arms opening as they descend The
derelicts forehead is punched in starred across and rent diagonally
She falls stern first our beam upon her slides like a lost soul down
that pitiless ladder of light and the Atlantic takes her

A filthy business says Hodgson I wonder what it must have been like
in the old days

The thought had crossed my mind too What if that wavering carcass had
been filled with the men of the old days each one of them taught that
is the horror of it that after death he would very possibly go for
ever to unspeakable torment

And scarcely a generation ago we one knows now that we are only our
fathers reenlarged upon the earth we I say ripped and rammed and
pithed to admiration

Here Tim from the Control Platform shouts that we are to get into our
inflators and to bring him his at once

We hurry into the heavy rubber suitsthe engineers are already
dressedand inflate at the airpump taps GPO inflators are thrice
as thick as a racing mans flickers and chafe abominably under the
armpits George takes the wheel until Tim has blown himself up to the
extreme of rotundity If you kicked him off the c p to the deck he
would bounce back But it is 162 that will do the kicking

The Mark Boats madstark ravin crazy he snorts returning to
command She says theres a bad blowout ahead and wants me to pull
over to Greenland Ill see her pithed first We wasted half an hour
fussing over that dead duck down under and now Im expected to go
rubbin my back all round the Pole What does she think a Postal
packets made of Gummed silk Tell her were coming on straight
George

George buckles him into the Frame and switches on the Direct Control
Now under Tims left toe lies the portengine Accelerator under his
left heel the Reverse and so with the other foot The liftshunt stops
stand out on the rim of the steeringwheel where the fingers of his left
hand can play on them At his right hand is the midships engine lever
ready to be thrown into gear at a moments notice He leans forward
in his belt eyes glued to the colloid and one ear cocked toward the
General Communicator Henceforth he is the strength and direction of
162 through whatever may befall

The Banks Mark Boat is reeling out pages of A BC Directions to
the traffic at large We are to secure all loose objects hood up
our Fleury Rays and on no account to attempt to clear snow from our
conningtowers till the weather abates Underpowered craft we are
told can ascend to the limit of their lift mailpackets to look out
for them accordingly the lower lanes westward are pitting very badly
with frequent blowouts vortices laterals etc

Still the clear dark holds up unblemished The only warning is the
electric skintension I feel as though I were a lacemakers pillow
and an irritability which the gibbering of the General Communicator
increases almost to hysteria

We have made eight thousand feet since we pithed the tramp and our
turbines are giving us an honest two hundred and ten knots

Very far to the west an elongated blur of red low down shows us the
North Banks Mark Boat There are specks of fire round her rising and
fallingbewildered planets about an unstable sunhelpless shipping
hanging on to her light for companys sake No wonder she could not quit
station

She warns us to look out for the backwash of the bad vortex in which
her beam shows it she is even now reeling

The pits of gloom about us begin to fill with very faintly luminous
filmswreathing and uneasy shapes One forms itself into a globe of
pale flame that waits shivering with eagerness till we sweep by It
leaps monstrously across the blackness alights on the precise tip of
our nose pirouettes there an instant and swings off Our roaring bow
sinks as though that light were leadsinks and recovers to lurch and
stumble again beneath the next blowout Tims fingers on the liftshunt
strike chords of numbers147246753 and so on for he is
running by his tanks only lifting or lowering her against the uneasy
air All three engines are at work for the sooner we have skated over
this thin ice the better Higher we dare not go The whole upper vault
is charged with pale krypton vapours which our skin friction may excite
to unholy manifestations Between the upper and lower levels5000 and
7000 hints the Mark Boatwe may perhaps bolt through if Our bow
clothes itself in blue flame and falls like a sword No human skill can
keep pace with the changing tensions A vortex has us by the beak and
we dive down a twothousand foot slant at an angle the dipdial and my
bouncing body record it of thirtyfive Our turbines scream shrilly
the propellers cannot bite on the thin air Tim shunts the lift out of
five tanks at once and by sheer weight drives her bullet wise through
the maelstrom till she cushions with jar on an upgust three thousand
feet below

Now weve done it says George in my ear Our skinfriction that
last slide has played Old Harry with the tensions Look out for
laterals Tim shell want some holding

Ive got her is the answer Come up old woman

She comes up nobly but the laterals buffet her left and right like the
pinions of angry angels She is jolted off her course four ways at once
and cuffed into place again only to be swung aside and dropped into
a new chaos We are never without a corposant grinning on our bows or
rolling head over heels from nose to midships and to the crackle of
electricity around and within us is added once or twice the rattle of
hailhail that will never fall on any sea Slow we must or we may break
our back pitchpoling

Airs a perfectly elastic fluid roars George above the tumult About
as elastic as a head sea off the Fastnet aint it

He is less than just to the good element If one intrudes on the Heavens
when they are balancing their voltaccounts if one disturbs the
High Gods marketrates by hurling steel hulls at ninety knots across
tremblingly adjusted electric tensions one must not complain of any
rudeness in the reception Tim met it with an unmoved countenance one
corner of his under lip caught up on a tooth his eyes fleeting into
the blackness twenty miles ahead and the fierce sparks flying from his
knuckles at every turn of the hand Now and again he shook his head
to clear the sweat trickling from his eyebrows and it was then that
George watching his chance would slide down the liferail and swab his
face quickly with a big red handkerchief I never imagined that a human
being could so continuously labour and so collectedly think as did Tim
through that Hells halfhour when the flurry was at its worst We were
dragged hither and yon by warm or frozen suctions belched up on the
tops of wuliiwas spun down by vortices and clubbed aside by laterals
under a dizzying rush of stars in the company of a drunken moon

I heard the rushing click of the midshipenginelever sliding in and
out the low growl of the liftshunts and louder than the yelling
winds without the scream of the bowrudder gouging into any lull that
promised hold for an instant At last we began to claw up on a cant
bowrudder and portpropeller together only the nicest balancing of
tanks saved us from spinning like the riflebullet of the old days

Weve got to hitch to windward of that Mark Boat somehow George
cried

Theres no windward I protested feebly where I swung shackled to a
stanchion How can there be

He laughedas we pitched into a thousand foot blowoutthat red man
laughed beneath his inflated hood

Look he said We must clear those refugees with a high lift

The Mark Boat was below and a little to the souwest of us fluctuating
in the centre of her distraught galaxy The air was thick with moving
lights at every level I take it most of them were trying to lie head to
wind but not being hydras they failed An undertanked Moghrabi boat
had risen to the limit of her lift and finding no improvement had
dropped a couple of thousand There she met a superb wulliwa and was
blown up spinning like a dead leaf Instead of shutting off she went
astern and naturally rebounded as from a wall almost into the Mark
Boat whose language our G C took it in was humanly simple

If theyd only ride it out quietly it ud be better said George in
a calm while we climbed like a bat above them all But some
skipperswill navigate without enough lift What does that Tadboat
think she is doing Tim

Playin kiss in the ring was Tims unmoved reply A TransAsiatic
Direct liner had found a smooth and butted into it full power But there
was a vortex at the tail of that smooth so the T A D was flipped out
like a pea from off a fingernail braking madly as she fled down and
all but overending

Now I hope shes satisfied said Tim Im glad Im not a
Mark Boat Do I want help The General Communicator dial had caught
his ear George you may tell that gentleman with my lovelove
remember Georgethat I do not want help Who is the officious
sardinetin

A Rimouski drogher on the lookout for a tow

Very kind of the Rimouski drogher This postal packet isnt being towed
at present

Those droghers will go anywhere on a chance of salvage George
explained We call em kittiwakes

A longbeaked bright steel ninetyfooter floated at ease for one
instant within hail of us her slings coiled ready for rescues and
a single hand in her open tower He was smoking Surrendered to the
insurrection of the airs through which we tore our way he lay in
absolute peace I saw the smoke of his pipe ascend untroubled ere his
boat dropped it seemed like a stone in a well

We had just cleared the Mark Boat and her disorderly neighbours when the
storm ended as suddenly as it had begun A shootingstar to northward
filled the sky with the green blink of a meteorite dissipating itself in
our atmosphere

Said George That may iron out all the tensions Even as he spoke the
conflicting winds came to rest the levels filled the laterals died out
in long easy swells the airways were smoothed before us In less
than three minutes the covey round the Mark Boat had shipped their
powerlights and whirred away upon their businesses

Whats happened I gasped The nervestore within and the volttingle
without had passed my inflators weighed like lead

God He knows said Captain George soberly That old shootingstars
skinfriction has discharged the different levels Ive seen it happen
before Phew What a relief

We dropped from ten to six thousand and got rid of our clammy suits
Tim shut off and stepped out of the Frame The Mark Boat was coming up
behind us He opened the colloid in that heavenly stillness and mopped
his face

Hello Williams he cried A degree or two out o station aint
you

May be was the answer from the Mark Boat Ive had some company this
evening

So I noticed Wasnt that quite a little draught

I warned you Why didnt you pull out north The eastbound packets
have

Me Not till Im running a Polar consumptives sanatorium boat I was
squinting through a colloid before you were out of your cradle my son

Id be the last man to deny it the captain of the Mark Boat replies
softly The way you handled her just nowIm a pretty fair judge of
traffic in a volthurryit was a thousand revolutions beyond anything
even Ive ever seen

Tims back supples visibly to this oiling Captain George on the c
p winks and points to the portrait of a singularly attractive maiden
pinned up on Tims telescope bracket above the steeringwheel

I see Wholly and entirely do I see

There is some talk overhead of coming round to tea on Friday a brief
report of the derelicts fate and Tim volunteers as he descends For
an A B C man young Williams is less of a hightension fool than some
Were you thinking of taking her on George Then Ill just have a look
round that portthrust seems to me its a trifle warmand well jog
along

The Mark Boat hums off joyously and hangs herself up in her appointed
eyrie Here she will stay a shutterless observatory a lifeboat
station a salvage tug a court of ultimate appealcummeteorological
bureau for three hundred miles in all directions till Wednesday next
when her relief slides across the stars to take her buffeted place Her
black hull double conningtower and everready slings represent
all that remains to the planet of that odd old word authority She is
responsible only to the Aerial Board of Control the A B C of which
Tim speaks so flippantly But that semielected seminominated body
of a few score of persons of both sexes controls this planet
Transportation is Civilisation our motto runs Theoretically we do
what we please so long as we do not interfere with the traffic AND
ALL IT IMPLIES Practically the A B C confirms or annuls all
international arrangements and to judge from its last report finds our
tolerant humorous lazy little planet only too ready to shift the whole
burden of public administration on its shoulders

I discuss this with Tim sipping mate on the c p while George fans
her along over the white blur of the Banks in beautiful upward curves
of fifty miles each The dipdial translates them on the tape in flowing
freehand

Tim gathers up a skein of it and surveys the last few feet which record
162s path through the voltflurry

I havent had a feverchart like this to show up in five years he
says ruefully

A postal packets dipdial records every yard of every run The tapes
then go to the A B C which collates and makes composite photographs
of them for the instruction of captains Tim studies his irrevocable
past shaking his head

Hello Heres a fifteenhundredfoot drop at fiftyfive degrees We
must have been standing on our heads then George

You dont say so George answers I fancied I noticed it at the
time

George may not have Captain Purnalls catlike swiftness but he is all
an artist to the tips of the broad fingers that play on the shuntstops
The delicious flightcurves come away on the tape with never a waver
The Mark Boats vertical spindle of light lies down to eastward setting
in the face of the following stars Westward where no planet should
rise the triple verticals of Trinity Bay we keep still to the Southern
route make a lowlifting haze We seem the only thing at rest under all
the heavens floating at ease till the earths revolution shall turn up
our landingtowers

And minute by minute our silent clock gives us a sixteensecond mile

Some fine night says Tim well be even with that clocks Master

Hes coming now says George over his shoulder Im chasing the
night west

The stars ahead dim no more than if a film of mist had been drawn under
unobserved but the deep airboom on our skin changes to a joyful shout

The dawngust says Tim Itll go on to meet the Sun Look
Look Theres the dark being crammed back over our bows Come to the
aftercolloid Ill show you something

The engineroom is hot and stuffy the clerks in the coach are asleep
and the Slave of the Ray is ready to follow them Tim slides open the
aft colloid and reveals the curve of the worldthe oceans deepest
purpleedged with fuming and intolerable gold

Then the Sun rises and through the colloid strikes out our lamps Tim
scowls in his face

Squirrels in a cage he mutters Thats all we are Squirrels in
a cage Hes going twice as fast as us Just you wait a few years my
shining friend and well take steps that will amaze you Well Joshua
you

Yes that is our dream to turn all earth into the Yale of Ajalon at our
pleasure So far we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length
in these latitudes But some dayeven on the Equatorwe shall hold the
Sun level in his full stride

Now we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic A big submersible
breaks water suddenly Another and another follows with a swash and
a suck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures The deepsea
freighters are rising to lung up after the long night and the leisurely
ocean is all patterned with peacocks eyes of foam

Well lung up too says Tim and when we return to the c p George
shuts off the colloids are opened and the fresh air sweeps her out
There is no hurry The old contracts they will be revised at the end of
the year allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind
her in ten So we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which
pushes us along at a languid twenty

To enjoy life and tobacco begin both on a sunny morning half a mile or
so above the dappled Atlantic cloudbelts and after a voltflurry which
has cleared and tempered your nerves While we discussed the thickening
traffic with the superiority that comes of having a high level reserved
to ourselves we heard and I for the first time the morning hymn on a
Hospital boat

She was cloaked by a skein of ravelled fluff beneath us and we caught
the chant before she rose into the sunlight Oh ye Winds of God sang
the unseen voices bless ye the Lord Praise Him and magnify Him for
ever

We slid off our caps and joined in When our shadow fell across her
great open platforms they looked up and stretched out their hands
neighbourly while they sang We could see the doctors and the nurses
and the whitebuttonlike faces of the cotpatients She passed slowly
beneath us heading northward her hull wet with the dews of the
night all ablaze in the sunshine So took she the shadow of a cloud
and vanished her song continuing Oh ye holy and humble men of heart
bless ye the Lord Praise Him and magnify Him for ever

Shes a public lunger or she wouldnt have been singing the Benedicite
and shes a Greenlander or she wouldnt have snowblinds over her
colloids said George at last Shell be bound for Frederikshavn or
one of the Glacier sanatoriums for a month If she was an accident ward

Funny how the new things are the old thing Ive read in books Tim
answered that savages used to haul their sick and wounded up to
the tops of hills because microbes were fewer there We hoist em in
sterilized air for a while Same idea How much do the doctors say weve
added to the average life of man

Thirty years says George with a twinkle in his eye Are we going to
spend em all up here Tim

Flap ahead then Flap ahead Whos hindering the senior captain
laughed as we went in

We held a good lift to clear the coastwise and Continental shipping
and we had need of it Though our route is in no sense a populated one
there is a steady trickle of traffic this way along We met Hudson Bay
furriers out of the Great Preserve hurrying to make their departure
from Bonavista with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets We
overcossed Keewatin liners small and cramped but their captains who
see no land between Trepassy and Lanco know what gold they bring back
from West Erica TransAsiatic Directs we met soberly ringing the
world round the Fiftieth Meridian at an honest seventy knots and
whitepainted Ackroyd  Hunt fruiters out of the south fled beneath us
their ventilated hulls whistling like Chinese kites Their market is
in the North among the northern sanatoria where you can smell their
grapefruit and bananas across the cold snows Argentine beef boats we
sighted too of enormous capacity and unlovely outline They too feed
the northern health stations in icebound ports where submersibles dare
not rise

Yellowbellied oreflats and Ungava petroltanks punted down leisurely
out of the north like strings of unfrightened wild duck It does not
pay to fly minerals and oil a mile farther than is necessary but the
risks of transhipping to submersibles in the ice pack off Nain or Hebron
are so great that these heavy freighters fly down to Halifax direct and
scent the air as they go They are the biggest tramps aloft except the
Athabasca graintubs But these last now that the wheat is moved are
busy over the worlds shoulder timberlifting in Siberia

We held to the St Lawrence it is astonishing how the old waterways
still pull us children of the air and followed his broad line of black
between its drifting iceblocks all down the Park that the wisdom of our
fathersbut every one knows the Quebec run

We dropped to the Heights Receiving Towers twenty minutes ahead of time
and there hung at ease till the Yokohama Intermediate Packet could pull
out and give us our proper slip It was curious to watch the action of
the holdingdown clips all along the frosty river front as the boats
cleared or came to rest A big Hamburger was leaving Pont Levis and her
crew unshipping the platform railings began to sing Elsinorethe
oldest of our chanteys You know it of course

 Mother Rugens teahouse on the Baltic
 Forty couple waltzing on the floor
 And you can watch my Ray
 For I must go away
 And dance with Ella Sweyn at Elsinore

Then while they sweated home the coveringplates

 NorNorNorNor
 West from Sourabaya to the Baltic
 Ninety knot an hour to the Skaw
 Mother Rugens teahouse on the Baltic
 And a dance with Ella Sweyn at Elsinore

The clips parted with a gesture of indignant dismissal as though
Quebec glittering under her snows were casting out these light and
unworthy lovers Our signal came from the Heights Tim turned and
floated up but surely then it was with passionate appeal that the great
tower arms flung openor did I think so because on the upper staging a
little hooded figure also opened her arms wide toward her father

        

In ten seconds the coach with its clerks clashed down to the
receivingcaisson the hostlers displaced the engineers at the idle
turbines and Tim prouder of this than all introduced me to the
maiden of the photograph on the shelf And by the way said he to her
stepping forth in sunshine under the hat of civil life I saw young
Williams in the Mark Boat Ive asked him to tea on Friday

 NOTES

 HighLevel Sleet

The Northern weather so far shows no sign of improvement From all
quarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the
higher levels Racing planes and digs alike have suffered severelythe
former from unequal deposits of halffrozen slush on their vans and
only those who have held up a badly balanced plane in a crosswind
know what that means and the latter from loaded bows and snowcased
bodies As a consequence the Northern and Northwestern upper levels
have been practically abandoned and the high fliers have returned to
the ignoble security of the Three Five and Six hundred foot levels
But there remain a few undaunted sunhunters who in spite of frozen
stays and icejammed connectingrods still haunt the blue empyrean


 BatBoat Racing

The scandals of the past few years have at last moved the yachting world
to concerted action in regard to bat boat racing We have been treated
to the spectacle of what are practically keeled racingplanes driven a
clear five foot or more above the water and only eased down to touch
their socalled native element as they near the line Judges and
starters have been conveniently blind to this absurdity but the public
demonstration off St Catherines Light at the Autumn Regattas has borne
ample if tardy fruit In the future the bat is to be a boat and
the longunheeded demand of the true sportsman for no daylight under
midkeel in smooth water is in a fair way to be conceded The new rule
severely restricts plane area and lift alike The gas compartments are
permitted both fore and aft as in the old type but the waterballast
central tank is rendered obligatory These things work if not
for perfection at least for the evolution of a sane and wholesome
waterborne cruiser The type of rudder is unaffected by the new rules
so we may expect to see the LongDavidson make the patent on which has
just expired come largely into use henceforward though the strain
on the sternpost in turning at speeds over forty miles an hour is
admittedly very severe But batboat racing has a great future before
it


 Crete and the A B C

The story of the recent Cretan crisis as told in the A B C Monthly
Report is not without humour Till the 25th October Crete as all our
planet knows was the sole surviving European repository of autonomous
institutions local selfgovernment and the rest of the archaic
lumber devised in the past for the confusion of human affairs She
has lived practically on the tourist traffic attracted by her annual
pageants of Parliaments Boards Municipal Councils etc etc Last
summer the islanders grew wearied as their premier explained of
playing at being savages for pennies and proceeded to pull down all
the landingtowers on the island and shut off general communication till
such time as the A B C should annex them For sidesplitting comedy
we would refer our readers to the correspondence between the Board of
Control and the Cretan premier during the war However alls well
that ends well The A B C have taken over the administration of Crete
on normal lines and tourists must go elsewhere to witness the debates
resolutions and popular movements of the old days The only people
to suffer will be the Board of Control which is grievously overworked
already It is easy enough to condemn the Cretans for their
laziness but when one recalls the large prosperous and presumably
publicspirited communities which during the last few years have
deliberately thrown themselves into the hands of the A B C one
cannot be too hard upon St Pauls old friends



 CORRESPONDENCE

 Skylarking on the Equator

To THE EDITOR Only last week while crossing the Equator W 2615
I became aware of a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or
twenty knots S 4 E Descending to the 500 ft level I found a party
of Transylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest
pattern atmospheric bombs A B C standard and in the intervals of
their pleasing labours firing bow and stern smokering swivels This
orgieI can give it no other namewent on for at least two hours
and naturally produced violent electric derangements My compasses of
course were thrown out my bow was struck twice and I received two
brisk shocks from the lower platformrail On remonstrating I was told
that these professors were engaged in scientific experiments The
extent of their scientific knowledge may be judged by the fact that
they expected to produce I give their own words a little blue sky
if they went on long enough This in the heart of the Doldrums at 450
feet I have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place
it can be found at the 4000 level for practically twelve months out of
the year but I submit with all deference to the educational needs of
Transylvania that skylarking in the centre of a maintravelled road
where at the best of times electricity literally drips off ones
stanchions and screw blades is unnecessary When my friends had
finished the road was seared and blown and pitted with unequal
pressure layers spirals vortices and readjustments for at least
an hour I pitched badly twice in an upward rushsolely due to these
diabolical throwdownsthat came near to wrecking my propeller
Equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without
the added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums

 Rhyl J VINCENT MATHEN

We entirely sympathize with Professor Mathens views but till
the Board sees fit to further regulate the Southern areas in which
scientific experiments may be conducted we shall always be exposed to
the risk which our correspondent describes Unfortunately a chimera
bombinating in a vacuum is nowadays only too capable of producing
secondary causesEditor


 Answers to Correspondents

VIGILANSThe Laws of Auroral Derangements are still imperfectly
understood Any overheated motor may of course seize without warning
but so many complaints have reached us of accidents similar to yours
while shooting the Aurora that we are inclined to believe with Lavalle
that the upper strata of the Aurora Borealis are practically one big
electric leak and that the paralysis of your engines was due to
complete magnetization of all metallic parts Lowflying planes often
glue up when near the Magnetic Pole and there is no reason in science
why the same disability should not be experienced at higher levels when
the Auroras are delivering strongly

INDIGNANTOn your own showing you were not under control That
you could not hoist the necessary N U C lights on approaching a
trafficlane because your electrics had shortcircuited is a misfortune
which might befall any one The A B C being responsible for the
planets traffic cannot however make allowance for this kind of
misfortune A reference to the Code will show that you were fined on the
lower scale

PLANISTON1 The Five Thousand Kilometre overland was won last year
by L V Rautsch R M Rautsch his brother in the same week pulling
off the Ten Thousand oversee R Ms average worked out at a
fraction over 500 kilometres per hour thus constituting a record
2 Theoretically there is no limit to the lift of a dirigible For
commercial and practical purposes 15000 tons is accepted as the most
manageable

PATERFAMILIASNone whatever He is liable for direct damage both to
your chimneys and any collateral damage caused by fall of bricks into
garden etc etc Bodily inconvenience and mental anguish may
be included but the average courts are not as a rule swayed by
sentiment If you can prove that his grapnel removed any portion of
your roof you had better rest your case on decoverture of domicile see
Parkins v Duboulay We sympathize with your position but the night
of the 14th was stormy and confused andyou may have to anchor on a
strangers chimney yourself some night Verbum sap

ALDEBARAN1 war as a paying concern ceased in 1987 2 The
Convention of London expressly reserves to every nation the right of
waging war so long as it does not interfere with the traffic and all
that implies 3 The A B C was constituted in 1949

L M P1 Keep her full headon at half power taking advantage of
the lulls to speed up and creep into it She will strain much less this
way than in quartering across a gale 2 Nothing is to be gained by
reversing into a following gale and there is always risk of a turnover
3 The formulae for stunsle brakes are uniformly unreliable and will
continue to be so as long as air is compressible

PEGAMOID1 Personally we prefer glass or flux compounds to any other
material for winter work nosecaps as being absolutely nonhygroscopic
2 We cannot recommend any particular make

PULMONAR1 For the symptoms you describe try the Gobi Desert

them except at the outset of the disease 2 We do not recommend
boardinghouses or hotels in this column

BEGINNEROn still days the air above a large inhabited city being
slightly warmerie thinnerthan the atmosphere of the surrounding
country a plane drops a little on entering the rarefied area precisely
as a ship sinks a little in fresh water Hence the phenomena of jolt

buy all the photos you need at Sokoto

NEW ERAIt is not etiquette to overcross an A B C officials boat

 REVIEW

 The Life of Xavier Lavalle
 Reviewed by Rene Talland Ecole Aeronautique Paris

Ten years ago Lavalle that imperturbable dreamer of the heavens
as Lazareff hailed him gathered together the fruits of a lifetimes
labour and gave it with welljustified contempt to a world bound
hand and foot to Baralds Theory of Vertices and compensating electric
nodes They shall see he wrotein that immortal postscript to The
Heart of the Cyclonethe Laws whose existence they derided written in
fire beneath them

But even here he continues there is no finality Better a thousand
times my conclusions should be discredited than that my dead name should
lie across the threshold of the temple of Sciencea bar to further
inquiry

So died Lavallea prince of the Powers of the Air and even at his
funeral Cellier jested at him who had gone to discover the secrets of
the Aurora Borealis

If I choose thus to be banal it is only to remind you that Colliers
theories are today as exploded as the ludicrous deductions of the
Spanish school In the place of their fugitive and warring dreams we
have definitely Lavalles Law of the Cyclone which he surprised in
darkness and cold at the foot of the overarching throne of the Aurora
Borealis It is there that I intent on my own investigations have
passed and repassed a hundred times the worn leonine face white as the
snow beneath him furrowed with wrinkles like the seams and gashes upon
the North Cape the nervous hand integrally a part of the mechanism of
his flighter and above all the wonderful lambent eyes turned to the
zenith

Master I would cry as I moved respectfully beneath him what is it
you seek today and always the answer clear and without doubt from
above The old secret my son

The immense egotism of youth forced me on my own path but cry of the
human always had I knownif I had knownI would many times have
bartered my poor laurels for the privilege such as Tinsley and Herrera
possess of having aided him in his monumental researches

It is to the filial piety of Victor Lavalle that we owe the two volumes
consecrated to the groundlife of his father so full of the holy
intimacies of the domestic hearth Once returned from the abysms of the
utter North to that little house upon the outskirts of Meudon it was
not the philosopher the daring observer the man of iron energy that
imposed himself on his family but a fat and even plaintive jester a
farceur incarnate and kindly the coequal of his children and it must
be written not seldom the comic despair of Madame Lavalle who as she
writes five years after the marriage to her venerable mother found in
this unequalled intellect whose name I bear the abandon of a large and
very untidy boy Here is her letter

Xavier returned from I do not know where at midnight absorbed in
calculations on the eternal question of his Aurorala belle Aurore
whom I begin to hate Instead of anchoringI had set out the
guidelight above our roof so he had but to descend and fasten the
planehe wandered profoundly distracted above the town with his
anchor down Figure to yourself dear mother it is the roof of the
mayors house that the grapnel first engages That I do not regret for
the mayors wife and I are not sympathetic but when Xavier uproots my
pet araucaria and bears it across the garden into the conservatory I
protest at the top of my voice Little Victor in his nightclothes runs
to the window enormously amused at the parabolic flight without reason
for it is too dark to see the grapnel of my prized tree The Mayor
of Meudon thunders at our door in the name of the Law demanding
I suppose my husbands head Here is the conversation through the
megaphoneXavier is two hundred feet above us

Mons Lavalle descend and make reparation for outrage of domicile
Descend Mons Lavalle

No one answers

Xavier Lavalle in the name of the Law descend and submit to process
for outrage of domicile

Xavier roused from his calculations comprehending only the last
words Outrage of domicile My dear mayor who is the man that has
corrupted thy Julie

The mayor furious Xavier Lavalle

Xavier interrupting I have not that felicity I am only a dealer in
cyclones

My faith he raised one then All Meudon attended in the streets and
my Xavier after a long time comprehending what he had done excused
himself in a thousand apologies At last the reconciliation was effected
in our house over a supper at two in the morningJulie in a wonderful
costume of compromises and I have her and the mayor pacified in bed in
the blue room

And on the next day while the mayor rebuilds his roof her Xavier
departs anew for the Aurora Borealis there to commence his lifes work
M Victor Lavalle tells us of that historic collision en plane on the
flank of Hecla between Herrera then a pillar of the Spanish school
and the man destined to confute his theories and lead him intellectually
captive Even through the years the immense laugh of Lavalle as he
sustains the Spaniards wrecked plane and cries Courage I shall not
fall till I have found Truth and I hold you fast rings like the
call of trumpets This is that Lavalle whom the world immersed in
speculations of immediate gain did not know nor suspectthe Lavalle
whom they adjudged to the last a pedant and a theorist

The human as apart from the scientific side developed in his own
volumes of his epochmaking discoveries is marked with a simplicity
clarity and good sense beyond praise I would specially refer such as
doubt the sustaining influence of ancestral faith upon character and
will to the eleventh and nineteenth chapters in which are contained
the opening and consummation of the Tellurionical Records extending over
nine years Of their tremendous significance be sure that the modest
house at Meudon knew as little as that the Records would one day be the
planets standard in all official meteorology It was enough for
them that their Xavierthis son this father this husbandascended
periodically to commune with powers it might be angelic beyond their
comprehension and that they united daily in prayers for his safety

Pray for me he says upon the eve of each of his excursions and
returning with an equal simplicity he renders thanks after supper in
the little room where he kept his barometers

To the last Lavalle was a Catholic of the old school acceptinghe who
had looked into the very heart of the lightningsthe dogmas of papal
infallibility of absolution of confessionof relics great and small
Marvellousenviable contradiction

The completion of the Tellurionical Records closed what Lavalle himself
was pleased to call the theoretical side of his labourslabours from
which the youngest and least impressionable planeur might well have
shrunk He had traced through cold and heat across the deeps of the
oceans with instruments of his own invention over the inhospitable
heart of the polar ice and the sterile visage of the deserts league by
league patiently unweariedly remorselessly from their evershifting
cradle under the magnetic pole to their exalted deathbed in the utmost
ether of the upper atmosphere each one of the Isoconical Tellurions
Lavalles Curves as we call them today He had disentangled the nodes
of their intersections assigning to each its regulated period of flux
and reflux Thus equipped he summons Herrera and Tinsley his pupils
to the final demonstration as calmly as though he were ordering his
flighter for some midday journey to Marseilles

I have proved my thesis he writes It remains now only that you
should witness the proof We go to Manila tomorrow A cyclone will form
off the Pescadores S 17 E in four days and will reach its maximum
intensity twentyseven hours after inception It is there I will show
you the Truth

A letter heretofore unpublished from Herrera to Madame Lavalle tells us
how the Masters prophecy was verified

I will not destroy its simplicity or its significance by any attempt to
quote Note well though that Herreras preoccupation throughout that
day and night of superhuman strain is always for the Masters bodily
health and comfort

At such a time he writes I forced the Master to take the broth or
I made him put on the fur coat as you told me Nor is Tinsley see
pp 184 85 less concerned He prepares the nourishment He cooks
eternally imperturbably suspended in the chaos of which the Master
interprets the meaning Tinsley bowed down with the laurels of both
hemispheres raises himself to yet nobler heights in his capacity of a
devoted chef It is almost unbelievable And yet men write of the Master
as cold aloof selfcontained Such characters do not elicit the joyous
and unswerving devotion which Lavalle commanded throughout life Truly
we have changed very little in the course of the ages The secrets of
earth and sky and the links that bind them we felicitate ourselves
we are on the road to discover but our neighbours heart and mind we
misread we misjudge we condemn now as ever Let all then who love a
man read these most human tender and wise volumes

A DEAL IN COTTON

Long and long ago when Devadatta was King of Benares I wrote some
tales concerning Strickland of the Punjab Police who married Miss
Youghal and Adam his son Strickland has finished his Indian Service
and lives now at a place in England called WestonsuperMare where his
wife plays the organ in one of the churches Semioccasionally he comes
up to London and occasionally his wife makes him visit his friends
Otherwise he plays golf and follows the harriers for his figures sake

If you remember that Infant who told a tale to Eustace Cleever the
novelist you will remember that he became a baronet with a vast estate
He has owing to cookery a little lost his figure but he never loses
his friends I have found a wing of his house turned into a hospital
for sick men and there I once spent a week in the company of two dismal
nurses and a specialist in Sprue Another time the place was full of
schoolboyssons of AngloIndians whom the Infant had collected for the
holidays and they nearly broke his keepers heart

But my last visit was better The Infant called me up by wire and I
fell into the arms of a friend of mine Colonel AL Corkran so that
the years departed from us and we praised Allah who had not yet
terminated the Delights nor separated the Companions

Said Corkran when he had explained how it felt to command a
native Infantry regiment on the border The Stricks are coming for
tonightwith their boy

I remember him The little fellow I wrote a story about I said Is
he in the Service

No Strick got him into the CentroEuroAfrica Protectorate Hes
AssistantCommissioner at Dupewherever that is Somaliland aint it
Stalky asked the Infant

Stalky puffed out his nostrils scornfully Youre only three thousand
miles out Look at the atlas

Anyhow hes as rotten full of fever as the rest of you said the
Infant at length on the big divan And hes bringing a native servant
with him Stalky be an athlete and tell Ipps to put him in the stable
room

Why Is he a Yaolike the fellow Wade brought herewhen your
housekeeper had fits Stalky often visits the Infant and has seen some
odd things

No Hes one of old Stricklands Punjabi policemenand quite
EuropeanI believe

Hooray Havent talked Punjabi for three monthsand a Punjabi from
Central Africa ought to be amusin

We heard the chuff of the motor in the porch and the first to enter was
Agnes Strickland whom the Infant makes no secret of adoring

He is devoted in a fat mans placid way to at least eight designing
women but she nursed him once through a bad bout of Peshawur fever and
when she is in the house it is more than all hers

You didnt send rugs enough she began Adam might have taken a
chill

Its quite warm in the tonneau Why did you let him ride in front

Because he wanted to she replied with the mothers smile and we
were introduced to the shadow of a young man leaning heavily on the
shoulder of a bearded Punjabi Mohammedan

That is all that came home of him said his father to me There
was nothing in it of the child with whom I had journeyed to Dalhousie
centuries since

And what is this uniform Stalky asked of Imam Din the servant who
came to attention on the marble floor

The uniform of the Protectorate troops Sahib Though I am the Little
Sahibs bodyservant it is not seemly for us white men to be attended
by folk dressed altogether as servants

Andand you white men wait at table on horseback Stalky pointed to
the mans spurs

These I added for the sake of honour when I came to England said Imam
Din Adam smiled the ghost of a little smile that I began to remember
and we put him on the big couch for refreshments Stalky asked him how
much leave he had and he said Six months

But hell take another six on medical certificate said Agnes
anxiously Adam knit his brows

You dont want toeh I know Wonder what my second in command is
doing Stalky tugged his moustache and fell to thinking of his Sikhs

Ah said the Infant Ive only a few thousand pheasants to look
after Come along and dress for dinner Were just ourselves What
flower is your honours ladyship commanding for the table

Just ourselves she said looking at the crotons in the great hall
Then lets have marigolds the little cemetery ones

So it was ordered

Now marigolds to us mean hot weather discomfort parting and death
That smell in our nostrils and Adams servant in waiting we naturally
fell back more and more on the old slang recalling at each glass those
who had gone before We did not sit at the big table but in the bay
window overlooking the park where they were carting the last of the
hay When twilight fell we would not have candles but waited for the
moon and continued our talk in the dusk that makes one remember

Young Adam was not interested in our past except where it had touched
his future I think his mother held his hand beneath the table Imam
Dinshoeless out of respect to the floorsbrought him his medicine
poured it drop by drop and asked for orders

Wait to take him to his cot when he grows weary said his mother and
Imam Din retired into the shadow by the ancestral portraits

Now what dyou expect to get out of your country the Infant asked
whenour India laid aside we talked Adams Africa It roused him at
once

Rubbernutsgumsand so on he said But our real future is
cotton I grew fifty acres of it last year in my District

My District said his father Hear him Mummy

I did though I wish I could show you the sample Some Manchester chaps
said it was as good as any Sea Island cotton on the market

But what made you a cottonplanter my son she asked

My Chief said every man ought to have a shouk a hobby of sorts and
he took the trouble to ride a day out of his way to show me a belt of
black soil that was just the thing for cotton

Ah What was your Chief like Stalky asked in his silkiest tones

The best man aliveabsolutely He lets you blow your own nose
yourself The people call himAdam jerked out some heathen
phrasethat means the Man with the Stone Eyes you know

Im glad of that Because Ive heard from other quarters Stalkys
sentence burned like a slow match but the explosion was not long
delayed Other quarters Adam threw out a thin hand Every dog has
his fleas If you listen to them of course The shake of his head was
as I remembered it among his fathers policemen twenty years before and
his mothers eyes shining through the dusk called on me to adore it I
kicked Stalky on the shin One must not mock a young mans first love or
loyalty

A lump of raw cotton appeared on the table

I thought there might be a need Therefore I packed it between our
shirts said the voice of Imam Din

Does he know as much English as that cried the Infant who had
forgotten his East

We all admired the cotton for Adams sake and indeed it was very long
and glossy

Itsits only an experiment he said Were such awful paupers we
cant even pay for a mailcart in my District We use a biscuitbox
on two bicycle wheels I only got the money for thathe patted the
stuffby a pure fluke

How much did it cost asked Strickland

With seed and machineryabout two hundred pounds I had the labour
done by cannibals

That sounds promising Stalky reached for a fresh cigarette

No thank you said Agnes Ive been at WestonsuperMare a little
too long for cannibals Ill go to the musicroom and try over next
Sundays hymns

She lifted the boys hand lightly to her lips and tripped across the
acres of glimmering floor to the musicroom that had been the Infants
ancestors banqueting hall Her grey and silver dress disappeared under
the musicians gallery two electrics broke out and she stood backed
against the lines of gilded pipes

Theres an abominable selfplaying attachment here she called

Me the Infant answered his napkin on his shoulder Thats how I
play Parsifal

I prefer the direct expression Take it away Ipps

We heard old Ipps skating obediently all over the floor

Now for the direct expression said Stalky and moved on the Burgundy
recommended by the faculty to enrich feverthinned blood

Its nothing much Only the belt of cottonsoil my chief showed me
ran right into the Sheshaheli country We havent been able to prove
cannibalism against that tribe in the courts but when a Sheshaheli
offers you four pounds of womans breast tattoo marks and all skewered
up in a plantain leaf before breakfast you

Naturally burn the villages before lunch said Stalky

Adam shook his head No troops he sighed I told my Chief about it
and he said we must wait till they chopped a white man He advised me if
ever I felt like it not to commit aa barren felo de se but to let the
Sheshaheli do it Then he could report and then we could mop em up

Most immoral Thats how we got Stalky quoted the name of a province
won by just such a sacrifice

Yes but the beasts dominated one end of my cottonbelt like anything
They chivied me out of it when I went to take soil for analysisme and
Imam Din

Sahib Is there a need The voice came out of the darkness and the
eyes shone over Adams shoulder ere it ceased

None The name was taken in talk Adam abolished him with a turn of
the finger I couldnt make a casus belli of it just then because my
Chief had taken all the troops to hammer a gang of slave kings up north
Did you ever hear of our war against Ibn Makarrah He precious nearly
lost us the Protectorate at one time though hes an ally of ours now

Wasnt he rather a pernicious brute even as they go said Stalky
Wade told me about him last year

Well his nickname all through the country was The Merciful and he
didnt get that for nothing None of our people ever breathed his
proper name They said He or That One and they didnt say it aloud
either He fought us for eight months

I remember There was a paragraph about it in one of the papers I
said

We broke him though Nothe slavers dont come our way because our
men have the reputation of dying too much the first month after theyre
captured That knocks down profits you see

What about your charming friends the Sheshahelis said the Infant

Theres no market for Sheshaheli People would as soon buy crocodiles
I believe before we annexed the country Ibn Makarrah dropped down on
em onceto train his young menand simply hewed em in pieces
The bulk of my people are agriculturists just the right stamp for
cottongrowers Whats Mother playingOnce in royal

The organ that had been crooning as happily as a woman over her babe
restored steadied to a tune

Magnificent Oh magnificent said the Infant loyally I had never
heard him sing but once and then though it was early in the tolerant
morning his mess had rolled him into a lotus pond

How did you get your cannibals to work for you asked Strickland

They got converted to civilization after my Chief smashed Ibn
Makarrahjust at the time I wanted em You see my Chief had promised
me in writing that if I could scrape up a surplus he would not bag it
for his roads this time but I might have it for my cotton game I only
needed two hundred pounds Our revenues didnt run to it

What is your revenue Stalky asked in the vernacular

With huttax traders game and mining licenses not more than fourteen
thousand rupees every penny of it earmarked months ahead Adam
sighed

Also there is a fine for dogs straying in the Sahibs camp Last year
it exceeded three rupees Imam Din said quietly

Well I thought that was fair They howled so We were rather strict on
fines I worked up my native clerkBulaki Ramto a ferocious pitch
of enthusiasm He used to calculate the profits of our cottonscheme
to three points of decimals after office I tell you I envied your
magistrates here hauling money out of motorists every week I had managed
to make our ordinary revenue and expenditure just about meet and I
was crazy to get the odd two hundred pounds for my cotton That sort of
thing grows on a chap when hes aloneand talks aloud

Hullo Have you been there already the father said and Adam nodded

Yes Used to spout what I could remember of Marmion to a tree sir
Well then my luck turned One evening an Englishspeaking nigger came in
towing a corpse by the feet You get used to little things like that
He said hed found it and please would I identify because if it
was one of Ibn Makarrahs men there might be a reward It was an old
Mohammedan with a strong dash of Araba smallboned baldheaded chap
and I was just wondering how it had kept so well in our climate when it
sneezed You ought to have seen the nigger He fetched a howl and bolted
likelike the dog in Tom Sawyer when he sat on the whatsitsname
beetle He yelped as he ran and the corpse went on sneezing I could
see it had been sarkied Thats a sort of gumpoison pater which
attacks the nerve centres Our chief medical officer is writing a
monograph about it So Imam Din and I emptied out the corpse one time
with my shaving soap and trade gunpowder and hot water

Id seen a case of sarkie before so when the skin peeled off his feet
and he stopped sneezing I knew hed live He was bad though lay like
a log for a week while Imam Din and I massaged the paralysis out of him
Then he told us he was a Hajjihad been three times to Meccacome in
from French Africa and that hed met the nigger by the waysidejust
like a case of thuggee in Indiaand the nigger had poisoned him That
seemed reasonable enough by what I knew of Coast niggers

You believed him said his father keenly

There was no reason I shouldnt The nigger never came back and the
old man stayed with me for two months Adam returned You know what
the best type of a Mohammedan gentleman can be pater He was that

None finer none finer was the answer

Except a Sikh Stalky grunted

Hed been to Bombay he knew French Africa inside out he could quote
poetry and the Koran all day long He played chessyou dont know what
that meant to melike a master We used to talk about the regeneration
of Turkey and the SheikulIslam between moves Oh everything under the
sun we talked about He was awfully openminded He believed in slavery
of course but he quite saw that it would have to die out Thats why
he agreed with me about developing the resources of the district by
cottongrowing you know

You talked of that too said Strickland

Rather We discussed it for hours You dont know what it meant to me
A wonderful man Imam Din was not our Hajji marvellous

Most marvellous It was all through the Hajji that we found the money
for our cottonplay Imam Din had moved I fancy behind Stricklands
chair

Yes It must have been dead against his convictions too He brought me
news when I was down with fever at Dupe that one of Ibn Makarrahs men
was parading through my District with a bunch of slavesin the Fork

Whats the matter with the Fork that you cant abide it said Stalky
Adams voice had risen at the last word

Local etiquette sir he replied too earnest to notice Stalkys
atrocious pun If a slaver runs slaves through British territory he
ought to pretend that theyre his servants Hawkin em about in the
Forkthe forked stick that you put round their necks you knowis
insolencesame as not backing your topsails in the old days Besides
it unsettles the District

I thought you said slavers didnt come your way I put in

They dont But my Chief was smoking em out of the North all that
season and they were bolting into French territory any road they could
find My orders were to take no notice so long as they circulated but
open slavedealing in the Fork was too much I couldnt go myself so I
told a couple of our Makalali police and Imam Din to make talk with
the gentleman one time It was rather risky and it might have been
expensive but it turned up trumps They were back in a few days with
the slaver he didnt show fight and a whole crowd of witnesses and
we tried him in my bedroom and fined him properly Just to show you
how demoralized the brute must have been Arabs often go dotty after a
defeat hed snapped up four or five utterly useless Sheshaheli and
was offering em to all and sundry along the road Why he offered em
to you didnt he Imam Din

I was witness that he offered maneaters for sale said Imam Din

Luckily for my cottonscheme that landed him both ways You see he
had slaved and exposed slaves for sale in British territory That meant
the double fine if I could get it out of him

What was his defence said Strickland late of the Punjab Police

As far as I rememberbut I had a temperature of 104 degrees at the
timehed mistaken the meridians of longitude Thought he was in French
territory Said hed never do it again if wed let him off with a fine
I could have shaken hands with the brute for that He paid up cash like
a motorist and went off one time

Did you see him

Yees Didnt I Imam Din

Assuredly the Sahib both saw and spoke to the slaver And the Sahib
also made a speech to the maneaters when he freed them and they swore
to supply him with labour for all his cottonplay The Sahib leaned on
his own servants shoulder the while

I remember something of that I remember Bulaki Ram giving me the
papers to sign and I distinctly remember him locking up the money in
the safetwo hundred and ten beautiful English sovereigns You dont
know what that meant to me I believe it cured my fever and as soon
as I could I staggered off with the Hajji to interview the Sheshaheli
about labour Then I found out why they had been so keen to work It
wasnt gratitude Their big village had been hit by lightning and burned
out a week or two before and they lay flat in rows around me asking me
for a job I gave it em

And so you were very happy His mother had stolen up behind us You
liked your cotton dear She tidied the lump away

By Jove I was happy Adam yawned Now if any one he looked at
the Infant cares to put a little money into the scheme itll be the
making of my District I cant give you figures sir but I assure

Youll take your arsenic and Imam Dinll take you up to bed and Ill
come and tuck you in

Agnes leaned forward her rounded elbows on his shoulders hands joined
across his dark hair and Isnt he a darling she said to us with
just the same heartrending lift to the left eyebrow and the same break
of her voice as sent Strickland mad among the horses in the year 84 We
were quiet when they were gone We waited till Imam Din returned to us
from above and coughed at the door as only darkhearted Asia can

Now said Strickland tell us what truly befell son of my servant

All befell as our Sahib has said Onlyonly there was an
arrangementa little arrangement on account of his cottonplay

Tell Sit I beg your pardon Infant said Strickland

But the Infant had already made the sign and we heard Imam Din hunker
down on the floor One gets little out of the East at attention

When the fever came on our Sahib in our roofed house at Dupe he
began the Hajji listened intently to his talk He expected the names
of women though I had already told him that Our virtue was beyond
belief or compare and that Our sole desire was this cottonplay Being
at last convinced the Hajji breathed on our Sahibs forehead to sink
into his brain news concerning a slavedealer in his district who had
made a mock of the law Sahib Imam Din turned to Strickland our
Sahib answered to those false words as a horse of blood answers to
the spur He sat up He issued orders for the apprehension of the
slavedealer Then he fell back Then we left him

Aloneservant of my son and son of my servant said his father

There was an old woman which belonged to the Hajji She had come in
with the Hajjis moneybelt The Hajji told her that if our Sahib died
she would die with him And truly our Sahib had given me orders to
depart

Being mad with fevereh

What could we do Sahib This cottonplay was his hearts desire He
talked of it in his fever Therefore it was his hearts desire that
the Hajji went to fetch Doubtless the Hajji could have given him money
enough out of hand for ten cottonplays but in this respect also our
Sahibs virtue was beyond belief or compare Great Ones do not exchange
moneys Therefore the Hajji saidand I helped with my counselthat we
must make arrangements to get the money in all respects conformable with
the English Law It was great trouble to us butthe Law is the Law
And the Hajji showed the old woman the knife by which she would die if
our Sahib died So I accompanied the Hajji

Knowing who he was said Strickland

No Fearing the man A virtue went out from him overbearing the virtue
of lesser persons The Hajji told Bulaki Ram the clerk to occupy the
seat of government at Dupe till our return Bulaki Ram feared the Hajji
because the Hajji had often gloatingly appraised his skill in figures
at five thousand rupees upon any slaveblock The Hajji then said to
me Come and we will make the maneaters play the cottongame for my
delights delight The Hajji loved our Sahib with the love of a father
for his son of a saved for his saviour of a Great One for a Great One
But I said We cannot go to that Sheshaheli place without a hundred
rifles We have here five The Hajji said I have untied as knot in my
headhandkerchief which will be more to us than a thousand I saw that
he had so loosed it that it lay flagwise on his shoulder Then I knew
that he was a Great One with virtue in him

We came to the highlands of the Sheshaheli on the dawn of the second
dayabout the time of the stirring of the cold wind The Hajji walked
delicately across the open place where their filth is and scratched
upon the gate which was shut When it opened I saw the maneaters lying
on their cots under the eaves of the huts They rolled off they rose
up one behind the other the length of the street and the fear on their
faces was as leaves whitening to a breeze The Hajji stood in the gate
guarding his skirts from defilement The Hajji said I am here once
again Give me six and yoke up They zealously then pushed to us with
poles six and yoked them with a heavy tree The Hajji then said Fetch
fire from the morning hearth and come to windward The wind is strong
on those headlands at sunrise so when each had emptied his crock of
fire in front of that which was before him the broadside of the town
roared into flame and all went The Hajji then said At the end of
a time there will come here the white man ye once chased for sport He
will demand labour to plant such and such stuff Ye are that labour and
your spawn after you They said lifting their heads a very little from
the edge of the ashes We are that labour and our spawn after us
The Hajji said What is also my name They said Thy name is also
The Merciful The Hajji said Praise then my mercy and while they did
this the Hajji walked away I following

The Infant made some noise in his throat and reached for more Burgundy

About noon one of our six fell dead Fright only frights Sahib None
hadnone couldtouch him Since they were in pairs and the other of
the Fork was mad and sang foolishly we waited for some heathen to do
what was needful There came at last Angari men with goats The Hajji
said What do ye see They said Oh our Lord we neither see nor
hear The Hajji said But I command ye to see and to hear and to say
They said Oh our Lord it is to our commanded eyes as though slaves
stood in a Fork The Hajji said So testify before the officer who
waits you in the town of Dupe They said What shall come to us
after The Hajji said The just reward for the informer But if ye do
not testify then a punishment which shall cause birds to fall from
the trees in terror and monkeys to scream for pity Hearing this
the Angari men hastened to Dupe The Hajji then said to me Are those
things sufficient to establish our case or must I drive in a village
full I said that three witnesses amply established any case but as
yet I said the Hajji had not offered his slaves for sale It is true
as our Sahib said just now there is one fine for catching slaves and
yet another for making to sell them And it was the double fine that
we needed Sahib for our Sahibs cottonplay We had forearranged
all this with Bulaki Ram who knows the English Law and I thought the
Hajji remembered but he grew angry and cried out O God Refuge of
the Afflicted must I who am what I am peddle this dogs meat by the
roadside to gain his delight for my hearts delight None the less he
admitted it was the English Law and so he offered me the sixfivein
a small voice with an averted head The Sheshaheli do not smell of sour
milk as heathen should They smell like leopards Sahib This is because
they eat men

Maybe said Strickland But where were thy wits One witness is not
sufficient to establish the fact of a sale

What could we do Sahib There was the Hajjis reputation to consider
We could not have called in a heathen witness for such a thing And
moreover the Sahib forgets that the defendant himself was making this
case He would not contest his own evidence Otherwise I know the law
of evidence well enough

So then we went to Dupe and while Bulaki Ram waited among the Angari
men I ran to see our Sahib in bed His eyes were very bright and his
mouth was full of upsidedown orders but the old woman had not loosened
her hair for death The Hajji said Be quick with my trial I am not
Job The Hajji was a learned man We made the trial swiftly to a sound
of soothing voices round the bed Yetyet because no man can be sure
whether a Sahib of that blood sees or does not see we made it strictly
in the manner of the forms of the English Law Only the witnesses and
the slaves and the prisoner we kept without for his noses sake

Then he did not see the prisoner said Strickland

I stood by to shackle up an Angari in case he should demand it but by
Gods favour he was too far fevered to ask for one It is quite true
he signed the papers It is quite true he saw the money put away in the
safetwo hundred and ten English pounds and it is quite true that the
gold wrought on him as a strong cure But as to his seeing the prisoner
and having speech with the maneatersthe Hajji breathed all that on
his forehead to sink into his sick brain A little as ye have heard
has remained Ah but when the fever broke and our Sahib called
for the finebook and the thin little picturebooks from Europe with
the pictures of ploughs and hoes and cotton3Dmillsah then he
laughed as he used to laugh Sahib It was his hearts desire this
cottonplay The Hajji loved him as who does not It was a little
little arrangement Sahib of whichis it necessary to tell all the
world

And when didst thou know who the Hajji was said Strickland

Not for a certainty till he and our Sahib had returned from their
visit to the Sheshaheli country It is quite true as our Sahib says the
maneaters lay flat around his feet and asked for spades to cultivate
cotton That very night when I was cooking the dinner the Hajji said
to me I go to my own place though God knows whether the Man with the
Stone Eyes have left me an ox a slave or a woman I said Thou art
then That One The Hajji said I am ten thousand rupees reward into
thy hand Shall we make another lawcase and get more cotton machines
for the boy I said What dog am I to do this May God prolong thy
life a thousand years The Hajji said Who has seen tomorrow God has
given me as it were a son in my old age and I praise Him See that the
breed is not lost

He walked then from the cookingplace to our Sahibs officetable under
the tree where our Sahib held in his hand a blue envelope of Service
newly come in by runner from the North At this fearing evil news for
the Hajji I would have restrained him but he said We be both Great
Ones Neither of us will fail Our Sahib looked up to invite the Hajji
to approach before he opened the letter but the Hajji stood off till
our Sahib had well opened and well read the letter Then the Hajji said
Is it permitted to say farewell Our Sahib stabbed the letter on the
file with a deep and joyful breath and cried a welcome The Hajji said
I go to my own place and he loosed from his neck a chained heart
of ambergris set in soft gold and held it forth Our Sahib snatched
it swiftly in the closed fist down turned and said If thy name be
written hereon it is needless for a name is already engraved on my
heart The Hajji said And on mine also is a name engraved but there
is no name on the amulet The Hajji stooped to our Sahibs feet but
our Sahib raised and embraced him and the Hajji covered his mouth with
his shouldercloth because it worked and so he went away

And what order was in the Service letter Stalky murmured

Only an order for our Sahib to write a report on some new cattle
sickness But all orders come in the same make of envelope We could not
tell what order it might have been

When he opened the lettermy sonmade he no sign A cough An oath
Strickland asked

None Sahib I watched his hands They did not shake Afterward he
wiped his face but he was sweating before from the heat

Did he know Did he know who the Hajji was said the Infant in
English

I am a poor man Who can say what a Sahib of that get knows or does not
know But the Hajji is right The breed should not be lost It is not
very hot for little children in Dupe and as regards nurses my sisters
cousin at Jull

Hm That is the boys own concern I wonder if his Chief ever knew
said Strickland

Assuredly said Imam Din On the night before our Sahib went down to
the sea the Great Sahibthe Man with the Stone Eyesdined with him in
his camp I being in charge of the table They talked a long while and
the Great Sahib said What didst thou think of That One We do not
say Ibn Makarrah yonder Our Sahib said Which one The Great Sahib
said That One which taught thy maneaters to grow cotton for thee He
was in thy District three months to my certain knowledge and I looked
by every runner that thou wouldst send me in his head Our Sahib said
If his head had been needed another man should have been appointed to
govern my District for he was my friend The Great Sahib laughed and
said If I had needed a lesser man in thy place be sure I would have
sent him as if I had needed the head of That One be sure I would have
sent men to bring it to me But tell me now by what means didst thou
twist him to thy use and our profit in this cottonplay Our Sahib
said By God I did not use that man in any fashion whatever He was
my friend The Great Sahib said Toh Vac Bosh Tell Our Sahib
shook his head as he doesas he did when a childand they looked at
each other like swordplay men in the ring at a fair The Great Sahib
dropped his eyes first and he said So be it I should perhaps have
answered thus in my youth No matter I have made treaty with That One
as an ally of the State Some day he shall tell me the tale Then I
brought in fresh coffee and they ceased But I do not think That One
will tell the Great Sahib more than our Sahib told him

Wherefore I asked

Because they are both Great Ones and I have observed in my life
that Great Ones employ words very little between each other in their
dealings still less when they speak to a third concerning those
dealings Also they profit by silence Now I think that the
mother has come down from the room and I will go rub his feet till he
sleeps

His ears had caught Agness step at the stairhead and presently she
passed us on her way to the music room humming the Magnificat




THE NEW KNIGHTHOOD

 I said the wet

 My very own knight

 And after this fashion adventure to seek
 Was Sir Galahad madeas it might be last week




THE PUZZLER

I had not seen Penfentenyou since the Middle Nineties when he was
Minister of Ways and Woodsides in De Thouars first Administration Last
summer though he nominally held the same portfolio he was his Colonys
Premier in all but name and the idol of his own province which is two
and a half times the size of England Politically his creed was his
growing country and he came over to England to develop a Great Idea in
her behalf

Believing that he had put it in train I made haste to welcome him to my
house for a week

That he was chased to my door by his own AgentGeneral in a motor that
they turned my study into a Cabinet Meeting which I was not invited to
attend that the local telegraph all but broke down beneath the strain
of hundred word coded cables and that I practically broke into the
house of a stranger to get him telephonic facilities on a Sunday are
things I overlook What I objected to was his ingratitude while I thus
tore up England to help him So I said Why on earth didnt you see
your Opposite Number in Town instead of bringing your office work here

Eh Who said he looking up from his fourth cable since lunch

See the English Minister for Ways and Woodsides

I saw him said Penfentenyou without enthusiasm

It seemed that he had called twice on the gentleman but without an
appointmentI thought if I wasnt big enough my business wasand
each time had found him engaged A third party intervening suggested
that a meeting might be arranged if due notice were given

Then said Penfentenyou I called at the office at ten oclock

But theyd be in bed I cried

One of the babies was awake He told me thatthat my sort of
questions he slapped the pile of cableswere only taken between 11
and 2 PM So I waited

And when you got to business I asked

He made a gesture of despair It was like talking to children Theyd
never heard of it

And your Opposite Number

Penfentenyou described him

Hush You mustnt talk like that I shuddered Hes one of the best
of good fellows You should meet him socially

Ive done that too he said Have you

Heaven forbid I cried but thats the proper thing to say

Oh he said all the proper things Only I thought as this was England
that theyd more or less have the hang of all thegeneral hangtogether
of my Idea But I had to explain it from the beginning

Ah Theyd probably mislaid the papers I said and I told him
the story of a threemillion pound insurrection caused by a deputy
UnderSecretary sitting upon a mass of greenlabelled correspondence
instead of reading it

I wonder it doesnt happen every week the answered Dyou mind my
having the AgentGeneral to dinner again tonight Ill wire and he can
motor down

The AgentGeneral arrived two hours later a patient and expostulating
person visibly torn between the pulling Devil of a rampant Colony
and the placid Baker of a largely uninterested England But with
Penfentenyou behind him he had worked for he told us that Lord
Lundiethe Law Lord was the final authority on the legal and
constitutional aspects of the Great Idea and to him it must be
referred

Good Heavens alive thundered Penfentenyou I told you to get that
settled last Christmas

It was the middle of the houseparty season said the AgentGeneral
mildly Lord Lundies at Credence Green nowhe spends his holidays
there Its only forty miles off

Shant I disturb his Holiness said Penfentenyou heavily Perhaps
my sort of questions he snorted maynt be discussed except at
midnight

Oh dont be a child I said

What this country needs said Penfentenyou is and for ten minutes
he trumpeted rebellion

What you need is to pay for your own protection I cut in when he
drew breath and I showed him a yellowish paper supplied gratis by
Government which is called Schedule D To my merciless delight he had
never seen the thing before and I completed my victory over him and
all the Colonies with a Brasseys Naval Annual and a Statesmans Year
Book

The AgentGeneral interposed with agentgeneralities but they were
merely provocateurs about Ties of Sentiment

They be blowed said Penfentenyou Whats the good of sentiment
towards a Kindergarten

Quite so Ties of common funk are the things that bind us together and
the sooner you new nations realize it the better What you need is an
annual invasion Then youd grow up

Thank you Thank you said the AgentGeneral Thats what I am always
trying to tell my people

But my dear fool Penfentenyou almost wept do you pretend that
these bananafingered amateurs at home are grown up

You poor serious pagan man I retorted if you take em that way
youll wreck your Great Idea

Will you take him to Lord Lundies tomorrow said the AgentGeneral
promptly

I suppose I must I said if you wont

Not me Im going home said the AgentGeneral and departed I am
glad that I am no colonys AgentGeneral

Penfentenyou continued to argue about naval contributions till 115
AM though I was victor from the first

At ten oclock I got him and his correspondence into the motor and
he had the decency to ask whether he had been unpolished overnight
I replied that I waited an apology This he made excuse for renewed
arguments and used wayside shows as illustrations of the decadence of
England

For example we burst a tyre within a mile of Credence Green and to
save time walked into the beautifully kept little village His eye was
caught by a building of paleblue tin stencilled Calvinist Chapel
before whose shuttered windows an Italian organgrinder with a
petticoated monkey was playing Dolly Grey

Yes Thats it snapped the egoist Thats a parable of the general
situation in England And look at those brutes A huge household
removals van was halted at a publichouse The men in charge were
drinking beer from blue and white mugs It seemed to me a pretty sight
but Penfentenyou said it represented Our National Attitude

Lord Lundies summer restingplace we learned was a farm a little out
of the village up a hill round which curled a high hedged road Only
an initiated few spend their holidays at Credence Green and they have
trained the householders to keep the place select Penfentenyou made a
grievance of this as we walked up the lane followed at a distance by
the organgrinder

Suppose he is having a houseparty he said Anythings possible in
this insane land

Just at that minute we found ourselves opposite an empty villa Its roof
was of black slate with bright unweathered ridgetiling its walls were
of bloodcoloured brick cornered and banded with vermiculated stucco
work and there was cobalt magenta and purest applegreen windowglass
on either side of the front door The whole was fenced from the road by
a low brickpillared flint wall topped with a castiron Gothic rail
picked out in blue and gold

Tight beds of geranium calceolaria and lobelia speckled the
glassplat from whose centre rose one of the finest araucarias its
other name by the way is monkeypuzzler that it has ever been my
lot to see It must have been full thirty feet high and its foliage
exquisitely answered the iron railings Such bijou ne plus ultras
replete with all the amenities do not as I pointed out to
Penfentenyou transpire outside of England

A hedge swinging sharp right flanked the garden and above it on
a slope of daisydotted meadows we could see Lord Lundies tiled and
halftimbered summer farmhouse Of a sudden we heard voices behind the
treethe fine full tones of the unembarrassed English speaking to
their equalsthat tore through the hedge like sleet through rafters

That it is not called monkeypuzzler for nothing I willingly
concedethis was a rich and rolling notebut on the other hand

I submit me lud that the name implies that it might could would
or should be ascended by a monkey and not that the ascent is a physical
impossibility I believe one of our South American spider monkeys
wouldnt hesitate By Jove it might be worth trying if

This was a crisper voice than the first A third higherpitched and
full of pleasant affectations broke in

Oh practical men there is no ape here Why do you waste one of Gods
own days on unprofitable discussion Give me a match

Ive a good mind to make you demonstrate in your own person Come on
Bubbles Well make Jimmy climb

There was a sound of scuffling broken by squeaks from Jimmy of the high
voice I turned back and drew Penfentenyou into the side of the flanking
hedge I remembered to have read in a society paper that Lord Lundies
lesser name was Bubbles

What are they doing Penfentenyou said sharply Drunk

Just playing Superabundant vitality of the Race you know Well watch
em I answered The noise ceased

My deliver Jimmy gasped The ram caught in the thicket andIm the
only one who can talk Neapolitan Leggo my collar He cried aloud in a
foreign tongue and was answered from the gate

Its the Calvinistic organgrinder I whispered I had already found
a practicable break at the bottom of the hedge Theyre going to try to
make the monkey climb I believe

Herelet me look Penfentenyou flung himself down and rooted till he
too broke a peephole We lay side by side commanding the entire garden
at ten yards range

You know em said Penfentenyou as I made some noise or other

By sight only The big fellow in flannels is Lord Lundie the
lightbuilt one with the yellow beard painted his picture at the last
Academy Hes a swell RA James Loman

And the brown chap with the hands

Tomling Sir Christopher Tomling the South American engineer who built
the

San Juan Viaduct I know said Penfentenyou We ought to have had him
with us Do you think a monkey would climb the tree

The organgrinder at the gate fenced his beast with one arm as
Jimmytalked

Dont show off your futile accomplishments said Lord Lundie Tell
him its an experiment Interest him

Shut up Bubbles You arent in court Jimmy replied This needs
delicacy Giuseppe says

Interest the monkey the brown engineer interrupted He wont climb
for love Cut up to the house and get some biscuits Bubblessugar ones
and an orange or two No need to tell our womenfolk

The huge white figure lobbed off at a trot which would not have
disgraced a boy of seventeen I gathered from something Jimmy let fall
that the three had been at Harrow together

That Tomling has a head on his Shoulders muttered Penfentenyou Pity
we didnt get him for the Colony But the question is will the monkey
climb

Be quick Jimmy Tell the man well give him five bob for the loan of
the beast Now run the organ under the tree and well dress it when
Bubbles comes back Sir Christopher cried

Ive often wondered said Penfentenyou whether it would puzzle
a monkey He had forgotten the needs of his Growing Nation and was
earnestly parting the whitethorn stems with his fingers

          

Giuseppe and Jimmy did as they were told the monkey following them with
a wary and malignant eye

Heres a discovery said Jimmy The singing part of this organ comes
off the wheels He spoke volubly to the proprietor Oh its so as
Giuseppe can take it to his room o nights And play it Dyou hear
that The organgrinder after his days crime plays his accursed
machine for love For love Chris And Michael Angelo was one of em

Dont jaw Tell him to take the beasts petticoat off said Sir
Christopher Tomling

Lord Lundie returned very little winded through a gap higher up the
hedge

Theyre all out thank goodness he cried but Ive raided what I
could Marrons glaces candied fruit and a bag of oranges

Excellent said the worldrenowned contractor

Jimmy youre the lightweight jump up on the organ and impale these
things on the leaves as I hand em

I see said Jimmy capering like a springbuck Upward and onward eh
First hell reach out forhow infernal prickly these leaves arethis
biscuit Next well lure him onthats about the reach of his
armwith the marron glace and then hell open out this orange How
human How like your ignoble career Bubbles

With care and elaboration they ornamented that trees lower branches
with sugartopped biscuits oranges bits of banana and marrons glaces
till it looked very apes path to Paradise

Unchain the Gyascutis said Sir Christopher commandingly Giuseppe
placed the monkey atop of the organ where the beast misunderstanding
stood on his head

Hes throwing himself on the mercy of the Court me lud said Jimmy
Nonow hes interested Now hes reaching after higher things What
wouldnt I give to have here he mentioned a name not unhonoured in
British Art Ambition plucking apples of Sodom the monkey had
pricked himself and was swearing Genius hampered by Convention Oh
theres a whole bushelful of allegories in it

Give him time Hes balancing the probabilities said Lord Lundie

The three closed round the monkeyhanging on his every motion with
an earnestness almost equal to ours The great judges headseamed and
vertical forehead iron mouth and pikelike underjaw all set on that
thick neck rising out of the white flannelled collarwas thrown against
the puckered green silk of the organfront as it might have been a cameo
of Titus Jimmy with raised eyes and parted lips fingered his grizzled
chestnut beard and I was near enough tonote the capable beauty of his
hands Sir Christopher stood a little apart his arms folded behind his
back one heavy brown boot thrust forward chin in as curbed and black
eyebrows lowered to shade the keen eyes

Giuseppes dark face between flashing earrings a twisted rag of red and
yellow silk round his throat turned from the reaching yearning monkey
to the pink and white biscuits spiked on the bronzed leafage And upon
them all fell the serious and workmanlike sun of an English summer
forenoon

Fils de Saint Louis montez au ciel said Lord Lundie suddenly in a
voice that made me think of Black Caps I do not know what the
monkey thought because at that instant he leaped off the organ and
disappeared

There was a clash of broken glass behind the tree

The monkeys face distorted with passion appeared at an upper window
of the house and a starred hole in the stainedglass window to the left
of the front door showed the first steps of his upward path

Weve got to catch him cried Sir Christopher Come along

They pushed at the door which was unlocked

Yes But consider the ethics of the case said Jimmy Isnt this
burglary or something Bubbles

Settle that when hes caught said Sir Christopher Were responsible
for the beast

A furious clanging of bells broke out of the empty house followed by
muffed gurglings and trumpetings

What the deuce is that I asked half aloud

The plumbing of course said Penfentenyou What a pity I believe
hed have climbed if Lord Lundie hadnt put him off

Wait a moment Chris said Jimmy the interpreter Guiseppe says he
may answer to the music of his infancy Giuseppe therefore will go
in with the organ Orpheus with his lute you know Avante Orpheus
Theres no Neapolitan for bathroom but I fancy your friend is there

Im not going into another mans house with a hurdygurdy said Lord
Lundie recoiling as Giuseppe unshipped the working mechanism of the
organ it developed a hangdown leg from its wheels slipped a strap
round his shoulders and gave the handle a twist

Dont be a cad Bubbles was Jimmys answer You couldnt leave us
now if you were on the Woolsack Play Orpheus The Cadi accompanies

         


With a whoop a buzz and a crash the organ sprang to life under
the hand of Giuseppe and the procession passed through the
grainedtoimitatewalnut front door A moment later we saw the monkey
ramping on the roof

Hell be all over the township in a minute if we dont head him said
Penfentenyou leaping to his feet and crashing into the garden We
headed him with pebbles till he retired through a window to the tuneful
reminder that he had left a lot of little things behind him As we
passed the front door it swung open and showed Jimmy the artist sitting
at the bottom of a newlycleaned staircase He waggled his hands at us
and when we entered we saw that the man was stricken speechless His
eyes grew redred like a ferretsand what little breath he had
whistled shrilly At first we thought it was a fit and then we saw that
it was mirththe inopportune mirth of the Artistic Temperament

The house palpitated to an infamous melody punctuated by the stump of
the barrelorgans one leg as Giuseppe above moved from room to room
after his rebel slave Now and again a floor shook a little under the
combined rushes of Lord Lundie and Sir Christopher Tomling who gave
many and contradictory orders But when they could they cursed Jimmy
with splendid thoroughness

Have you anything to do with the house panted Jimmy at last Because
were using it just now He gulped And Im ahkeeping cave

All right said Penfentenyou and shut the hall door

Jimmy you unspeakable blackguard Jimmy you cur You coward
Lord Lundies voice overbore the flood of melody Come up here
Giussieppes saying something we dont understand

Jimmy listened and interpreted between hiccups

He says youd better play the organ Bubbles and let him do the
stalking The monkey knows him

By Jove hes quite right said Sir Christopher from the landing
Take it Bubbles at once

My God said Lord Lundie in horror

The chase reverberated over our heads from the attics to the first
floor and back again Bodies and Voices met in collision and argument
and once or twice the organ hit walls and doors Then it broke forth in
a new manner

Hes playing it said Jimmy I know his acute Justinian ear Are you
fond of music

I think Lord Lundie plays very well for a beginner I ventured

Ah Thats the trained legal intellect Like mastering a brief I
havent got it He wiped his eyes and shook

Hi said Penfentenyou looking through the stained glass window down
the garden Whats that

         


A household removals van in charge of four men had halted at the
gate A husband and his wife householders beyond questionquavered
irresolutely up the path He looked tired She was certainly cross
In all this haphazard world the last couple to understand a scientific
experiment

I laid hands on Jimmythe clamour above drowning speech and with
Penfentenyous aid propped him against the window that he should see

He saw nodded fell as an umbrella can fall and kneeling beat his
forehead on the shut door Penfentenyou slid the bolt

The furniture men reinforced the two figures on the path and advanced
spreading generously

Hadnt we better warn them upstairs I suggested

No Ill die first said Jimmy Im pretty near it now Besides they
called me names

I turned from the Artist to the Administrator

Ceteris paribus I think wed better be going said Penfentenyou
dealer in crises

Tatake me with you said Jimmy Ive no reputation to lose but Id
like to watch em fromeroutside the picture

Theres always a modus vivendi Penfentenyou murmured and tiptoed
along the hall to a back door which he opened quite silently We passed
into a tangle of gooseberry bushes where at his statesmanlike example
we crawled on all fours and regained the hedge

Here we lay up secure in our alibi

But your firmthe woman was wailing to the furniture removals
menyour firm promised me everything should be in yesterday And its
today You should have been here yesterday

The last tenants aint out yet lydy said one of them

Lord Lundie was rapidly improving in technique though organgrinding
unlike the Law is more of a calling than a trade and he hung
occasionally on a dead centre Giuseppe I think was singing but I
could not understand the drift of Sir Christophers remarks They were
Spanish

The woman said something we did not catch

You might ave sublet it the man insisted Or your gentleman ere
might

But I didnt Send for the Police at once

I wouldnt do that lydy Theyre only fruit pickers on a beano They
arent particular where they sleep

Dyou mean theyve been sleeping there I only had it cleaned last
week Get them out

Oh if you say so well ave em out of it in two twos Alf fetch me
the spare swinglebar

Dont Youll knock the paint off the door Get them out

What the ell else am I trying to do for you lydy the man answered
with pathos but the woman wheeled on her mate

Edward Theyre all drunk here and theyre all mad there Do
something she said

Edward took one short step forward and sighed Hullo in the direction
of the turbulent house The woman walked up and down the very figure
of Domestic Tragedy The furniture men swayed a little on their heels
and

Got him The shout rang through all the windows at once It was
followed by a bloodhoundlike bay from Sir Christopher a maniacal
prestissimo on the organ and loud cries for Jimmy But Jimmy at my
side rolled his congested eyeballs owlwise

I never knew them he said Im an orphan

         


The front door opened and the three came forth to shortlived triumph
I had never before seen a Law Lord dressed as for tennis with a
stumpleg barrelorgan strapped to his shoulder But it is a shy bird
in this plumage Lord Lundie strove to disembarrass himself of his
accoutrements much as an illtrained Punch and Judy dog tries to escape
backwards through his frilled collar Sir Christopher covered with
limewash cherished a bleeding thumb and the almost crazy monkey tore
at Giuseppes hair

The men on both sides reeled but the woman stood her ground Idiots
she said and once more Idiots

I could have gladdened a few convicts of my acquaintance with a
photograph of Lord Lundie at that instant

Madam he began wonderfully preserving the roll in his voice it was
a monkey

Sir Christopher sucked his thumb and nodded

Take it away and go she replied Go away

I would have gone and gladly on this permission but these still
strong men must ever be justifying themselves Lord Lundie turned to the
husband who for the first time spoke

I have rented this house I am moving in he said

We ought to have been in yesterday the woman interrupted

Yes We ought to have been in yesterday Have you slept there
overnight said the man peevishly

No I assure you we havent said Lord Lundie

Then go away Go quite away cried the woman

They wentin single file down the path They went silently restrapping
the organ on its wheels and rechaining the monkey to the organ

Damn it all said Penfentenyou They do face the music and they do
stick by each other in private life

Ties of Common Funk I answered Giuseppe ran to the gate and fled
back to the possible world Lord Lundie and Sir Christopher constrained
by tradition paced slowly

Then it came to pass that the woman who walked behind them lifted up
her eyes and beheld the tree which they had dressed

Stop she called and they stopped Who did that

There was no answer The Eternal Bad Boy in every man hung its head
before the Eternal Mother in every woman

Who put these disgusting things there she repeated

Suddenly Penfentenyou Premier of his Colony in all but name left Jimmy
and me and appeared at the gate If he is not turned out of office
that is how he will appear on the Day of Armageddon

Well done you he cried zealously and doffed his hat to the woman
Have you any children madam he demanded

Yes two They should have been here today The firm promised

Then were not a minute too soon That monkey escaped It was a very
dangerous beast Might have frightened your children into fits All the
organgrinders fault A most lucky thing these gentlemen caught it when
they did I hope you arent badly mauled Sir Christopher Shaken as
I was I wanted to get away and laugh I could not but admire the
scoundrels consummate tact in leading his second highest trump An ass
would have introduced Lord Lundie and they would not have believed him

It took the trick The couple smiled and gave respectful thanks for
their deliverance by such hands from such perils

Not in the least said Lord Lundie Anybodyany father would have
done as much and pray dont apologize your mistake was quite natural
A furniture man sniggered here and Lord Lundie rolled an Eye of Doom on
their ranks By the way if you have trouble with these personsthey
seem to have taken as much as is good for themplease let me know
ErGood morning

They turned into the lane

Heavens said Jimmy brushing himself down Whos that real man
with the real head and we hurried after them for they were running
unsteadily squeaking like rabbits as they ran We overtook them in a
little nut wood half a mile up the road where they had turned aside
and were rolling So we rolled with them and ceased not till we had
arrived at the extremity of exhaustion

Youyou saw it all then said Lord Lundie rebuttoning his
nineteeninch collar

I saw it was a vital question from the first responded Penfentenyou
and blew his nose

It was By the way dyou mind telling me your name


Summa Penfentenyous Great Idea has gone through a little chipped
at the edges but in fine and farreaching shape His Opposite Number
worked at it like a mulea bewildered mule beaten from behind coaxed
from in front and propped on either soft side by Lord Lundie of the
compressed mouth and the searing tongue

Sir Christopher Tomling has been ravished from the Argentine where
after all he was but preparing traderoutes for hostile peoples and
now adorns the forefront of Penfentenyous Advisory Board This was an
unforeseen extra as was Jimmys gratis fulllengthit will be in this
years Academy of Penfentenyou who has returned to his own place

Now and again from afar off between the slam and bump of his shifting
scenery the glare of his manipulated limelight and the controlled
rolling of his thunderdrums I catch his voice lifted in encouragement
and advice to his fellowcountrymen He is quite sound on Ties of
Sentiment andalone of Colonial Statesmen ventures to talk of the Ties
of Common Funk

Herein I have my reward




THE PUZZLER

 The Celt in all his variants from Builth to Ballyhoo
 His mental processes are plainone knows what he will do
 And can logically predicate his finish by his start
 But the Englishah the Englishthey are quite a race apart

 Their psychology is bovine their outlook crude and rare
 They abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw
 But the straw that they were tickled withthe chaff that
 they were fed with
 They convert into a weavers beam to break their foemans head
 with

 For undemocratic reasons and for motives not of State
 They arrive at their conclusionslargely inarticulate
 Being void of selfexpression they confide their views to none
 But sometimes in a smokingroom one learns why things were
 done

 In telegraphic sentences half swallowed at the ends
 They hint a matters inwardnessand there the matter ends
 And while the Celt is talking from Valencia to Kirkwall
 The Englishah the Englishdont say anything at all




LITTLE FOXES

A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT

A fox came out of his earth on the banks of the Great River Gihon
which waters Ethiopia He saw a white man riding through the dry
dhurrastalks and that his destiny might be fulfilled barked at him

The rider drew rein among the villagers round his stirrup

What said he is that

That said the Sheikh of the village is a fox O Excellency Our
Governor

It is not then a jackal

No jackal but Abu Hussein the father of cunning

Also the white man spoke half aloud I am Mudir of this Province

It is true they cried Ya Saart el Mudir O Excellency Our
Governor

The Great River Gihon well used to the moods of kings slid between his
milewide banks toward the sea while the Governor praised God in a loud
and searching cry never before heard by the river

When he had lowered his right forefinger from behind his right ear the
villagers talked to him of their cropsbarley dhurrah millet onions
and the like The Governor stood in his stirrups North he looked up
a strip of green cultivation a few hundred yards wide that lay like a
carpet between the river and the tawny line of the desert Sixty miles
that strip stretched before him and as many behind At every halfmile
a groaning waterwheel lifted the soft water from the river to the crops
by way of a mudbuilt aqueduct A foot or so wide was the waterchannel
five foot or more high was the bank on which it ran and its base was
broad in proportion Abu Hussein misnamed the Father of Cunning drank
from the river below his earth and his shadow was long in the low sun
He could not understand the loud cry which the Governor had cried

The Sheikh of the village spoke of the crops from which the rulers of
all lands draw revenue but the Governors eyes were fixed between his
horses ears on the nearest waterchannel

Very like a ditch in Ireland he murmured and smiled dreaming of a
razortopped bank in distant Kildare

Encouraged by that smile the Sheikh continued When crops fail it is
necessary to remit taxation Then it is a good thing O Excellency
Our Governor that you come and see the crops which have failed and
discover that we have not lied

Assuredly The Governor shortened his reins The horse cantered on
rose at the embankment of the waterchannel changed leg cleverly on
top and hopped down in a cloud of golden dust

Abu Hussein from his earth watched with interest He had never before
seen such things

Assuredly the Governor repeated and came back by the way he had
gone It is always best to see for ones self

An ancient and still bulletspeckled sternwheel steamer with a barge
lashed to her side came round the river bend She whistled to tell the
Governor his dinner was ready and the horse seeing his fodder piled on
the barge whinnied back

Moreover the Sheikh added in the days of the Oppression the Emirs
and their creatures dispossessed many people of their lands All up and
down the river our people are waiting to return to their lawful fields

Judges have been appointed to settle that matter said the Governor
They will presently come in steamers and hear the witnesses

Wherefore Did the Judges kill the Emirs We would rather be judged by
the men who executed Gods judgment on the Emirs We would rather abide
by your decision O Excellency Our Governor

The Governor nodded It was a year since he had seen the Emirs stretched
close and still round the reddened sheepskin where lay El Mahdi the
Prophet of God Now there remained no trace of their dominion except the
old steamer once part of a Dervish flotilla which was his house and
office She sidled into the shore lowered a plank and the Governor
followed his horse aboard

Lights burned on her till late dully reflected in the river that tugged
at her mooringropes The Governor read not for the first time the
administration reports of one John Jorrocks MFH

We shall need he said suddenly to his Inspector about ten couple
Ill get em when I go home Youll be Whip Baker

The Inspector who was not yet twentyfive signified his assent in the
usual manner while Abu Hussein barked at the vast desert moon

Ha said the Governor coming out in his pyjamas well be giving you
capivi in another three months my friend

     

It was four as a matter of fact ere a steamer with a melodious
bargeful of hounds anchored at that landing The Inspector leaped down
among them and the homesick wanderers received him as a brother

Everybody fed em everything on board ship but theyre real dainty
hounds at bottom the Governor explained Thats Royal youve got hold
ofthe pick of the bunchand the bitch thats got hold of youshes
a little excitedis May Queen Merriman out of Cottesmore Maudlin you
know

I know Grand old betch with the tan eyebrows the Inspector cooed
Oh Ben I shall take an interest in life now Hark to em O hark

Abu Hussein under the high bank went about his nights work An eddy
carried his scent to the barge and three villages heard the crash of
music that followed Even then Abu Hussein did not know better than to
bark in reply

Well what about my Province the Governor asked

Not so bad the Inspector answered with Royals head between his
knees Of course all the villages want remission of taxes but as far
as I can see the whole countrys stinkin with foxes Our trouble will
be choppin em in cover Ive got a list of the only villages entitled
to any remission What dyou call this flatsided bluemottled beast
with the jowl

Beagleboy I have my doubts about him Do you think we can get two
days a week

Easy and as many byes as you please The Sheikh of this village here
tells me that his barley has failed and he wants a fifty per cent
remission

Well begin with him tomorrow and look at his crops as we go Nothing
like personal supervision said the Governor

They began at sunrise The pack flew off the barge in every direction
and after gambols dug like terriers at Abu Husseins many earths Then
they drank themselves potbellied on Gihon water while the Governor and
the Inspector chastised them with whips Scorpions were added for May
Queen nosed one and was removed to the barge lamenting Mystery a
puppy alas met a snake and the bluemottled Beagleboy never a
dainty hound ate that which he should have passed by Only Royal of
the Belvoir tan head and the sad discerning eyes made any attempt to
uphold the honour of England before the watching village

You cant expect everything said the Governor after breakfast

We got it thougheverything except foxes Have you seen May Queens
nose said the Inspector

And Mysterys dead Well keep em coupled next time till we get well
in among the crops I say what a babbling bodysnatcher that Beagleboy
is Ought to be drowned

They bury people so damn casual hereabouts Give him another chance
the Inspector pleaded not knowing that he should live to repent most
bitterly

Talkin of chances said the Governor this Sheikh lies about his
barley bein a failure If its high enough to hide a hound at this time
of year its all right And he wants a fifty per cent remission you
said

You didnt go on past the melon patch where I tried to turn Wanderer
Its all burned up from there on to the desert His other waterwheel
has broken down too the Inspector replied

Very good Well split the difference and allow him twentyfive per
cent off Wherell we meet tomorrow

Theres some trouble among the villages down the river about their
landtitles Its good goin ground there too the Inspector said

The next meet then was some twenty miles down the river and the pack
were not enlarged till they were fairly among the fields Abu Hussein
was there in forcefour of him Four delirious hunts of four minutes
eachfour hounds per foxended in four earths just above the river
All the village looked on

We forgot about the earths The banks are riddled with em Thisll
defeat us said the Inspector

Wait a moment The Governor drew forth a sneezing hound Ive just
remembered Im Governor of these parts

Then turn out a black battalion to stop for us Well need em old
man

The Governor straightened his back Give ear O people he cried I
make a new Law

The villagers closed in He called

Henceforward I will give one dollar to the man on whose land Abu
Hussein is found And another dollarhe held up the cointo the man
on whose land these dogs shall kill him But to the man on whose land
Abu Hussein shall run into a hole such as is this hole I will give not
dollars but a most unmeasurable beating Is it understood

Our Excellency a man stepped forth on my land Abu Hussein was found
this morning Is it not so brothers

None denied The Governor tossed him over four dollars without a word

On my land they all went into their holes cried another Therefore I
must be beaten

Not so The land is mine and mine are the beatings

This second speaker thrust forward his shoulders already bared and the
villagers shouted

Hullo Two men anxious to be licked There must be some swindle about
the land said the Governor Then in the local vernacular What are
your rights to the beating

As a riverreach changes beneath a slant of the sun that which had been
a scattered mob changed to a court of most ancient justice The hounds
tore and sobbed at Abu Husseins hearthstone all unnoticed among
the legs of the witnesses and Gihon also accustomed to laws purred
approval

You will not wait till the Judges come up the river to settle the
dispute said the Governor at last

No shouted all the village save the man who had first asked to be
beaten We will abide by Our Excellencys decision Let Our Excellency
turn out the creatures of the Emirs who stole our land in the days of
the Oppression

And thou sayest the Governor turned to the man who had first asked to
be beaten

I say 1 will wait till the wise Judges come down in the steamer Then I
will bring my many witnesses he replied

He is rich He will bring many witnesses the village Sheikh muttered

No need Thy own mouth condemns thee the Governor cried No man
lawfully entitled to his land would wait one hour before entering upon
it Stand aside The man fell back and the village jeered him

The second claimant stooped quickly beneath the lifted huntingcrop The
village rejoiced

Oh Such an one Son of such an one said the Governor prompted by
the Sheikh learn from the day when I send the order to block up all
the holes where Abu Hussein may hide onthyland

The light flicks ended The man stood up triumphant By that accolade
had the Supreme Government acknowledged his title before all men

While the village praised the perspicacity of the Governor a naked
pockmarked child strode forward to the earth and stood on one leg
unconcerned as a young stork

Hal he said hands behind his back This should be blocked up with
bundles of dhurra stalksor better bundles of thorns

Better thorns said the Governor Thick ends innermost

The child nodded gravely and squatted on the sand

An evil day for thee Abu Hussein he shrilled into the mouth of the
earth A day of obstacles to thy flagitious returns in the morning

Who is it the Governor asked the Sheikh It thinks

Farag the Fatherless His people were slain in the days of the
Oppression The man to whom Our Excellency has awarded the land is as
it were his maternal uncle

Will it come with me and feed the big dogs said the Governor

The other peering children drew back Run they cried Our Excellency
will feed Farag to the big dogs

I will come said Farag And I will never go He threw his arm round
Royals neck and the wise beast licked his face

Binjamin by Jove the Inspector cried

No said the Governor I believe he has the makings of a James Pigg

Farag waved his hand to his uncle and led Royal on to the barge The
rest of the pack followed

     

Gihon that had seen many sports learned to know the Hunt barge well
He met her rounding his bends on grey December dawns to music wild and
lamentable as the almost forgotten throb of Dervish drums when high
above Royals tenor bell sharper even than lying Beagleboys falsetto
break Farag chanted deathless war against Abu Hussein and all his seed
At sunrise the river would shoulder her carefully into her place and
listen to the rush and scutter of the pack fleeing up the gangplank
and the tramp of the Governors Arab behind them They would pass over
the brow into the dewless crops where Gihon low and shrunken could
only guess what they were about when Abu Hussein flew down the bank
to scratch at a stopped earth and flew back into the barley again As
Farag had foretold it was evil days for Abu Hussein ere he learned to
take the necessary steps and to get away crisply Sometimes Gihon saw
the whole procession of the Hunt silhouetted against the morningblue
bearing him company for many merry miles At every half mile the horses
and the donkeys jumped the waterchannelsup on change your leg and
off again like figures in a zoetrope till they grew small along the
line of waterwheels Then Gibon waited their rustling return through
the crops and took them to rest on his bosom at ten oclock While the
horses ate and Farag slept with his head on Royals flank the Governor
and his Inspector worked for the good of the Hunt and his Province

After a little time there was no need to beat any man for neglecting
his earths The steamers destination was telegraphed from waterwheel
to waterwheel and the villagers stopped out and put to according If an
earth were overlooked it meant some dispute as to the ownership of the
land and then and there the Hunt checked and settled it in this wise
The Governor and the Inspector side by side but the latter half a
horses length to the rear both bareshouldered claimants well in
front the villagers halfmooned behind them and Farag with the pack
who quite understood the performance sitting down on the left Twenty
minutes were enough to settle the most complicated case for as the
Governor said to a judge on the steamer One gets at the truth in a
huntingfield a heap quicker than in your lawcourts

But when the evidence is conflicting the Judge suggested

Watch the field Theyll throw tongue fast enough if youre running a
wrong scent Youve never had an appeal from one of my decisions yet

The Sheikhs on horsebackthe lesser folk on clever donkeysthe
children so despised by Farag soon understood that villages which
repaired their waterwheels and channels stood highest in the Governors
favour He bought their barley for his horses

Channels he said are necessary that we may all jump them They are
necessary moreover for the crops Let there be many wheels and sound
channelsand much good barley

Without money replied an aged Sheikh there are no waterwheels

I will lend the money said the Governor

At what interest O Our Excellency

Take you two of May Queens puppies to bring up in your village in
such a manner that they do not eat filth nor lose their hair nor catch
fever from lying in the sun but become wise hounds

Like Rayyalnot like Bigglebai Already it was an insult along
the River to compare a man to the shifty anthropophagous bluemottled
harrier

Certainly like Rayyalnot in the least like Bigglebai That shall be
the interest on the loan Let the puppies thrive and the waterwheel be
built and I shall be content said the Governor

The wheel shall be built but O Our Excellency if by Gods favour
the pups grow to be wellsmelters not filtheaters not unaccustomed to
their names not lawless who will do them and me justice at the time of
judging the young dogs

Hounds man hounds Hawands O Sheikh we call them in their
manhood

The hawands when they are judged at the Shaho I have unfriends down
the river to whom Our Excellency has also entrusted hawands to bring
up

Puppies man Pahpeaz we call them O Sheikh in their childhood

Pahpeat My enemies may judge my pahpeaz unjustly at the Shaho This
must be thought of

I see the obstacle Hear now If the new waterwheel is built in a month
without oppression thou O Sheikh shalt be named one of the judges to
judge the pahpeaz at the Shaho Is it understood

Understood We will build the wheel I and my seed are responsible for
the repayment of the loan Where are my pahpeaz If they eat fowls
must they on any account eat the feathers

On no account must they eat the feathers Farag in the barge will tell
thee how they are to live

There is no instance of any default on the Governors personal and
unauthorized loans for which they called him the Father of Waterwheels
But the first puppyshow at the capital needed enormous tact and the
presence of a black battalion ostentatiously drilling in the barrack
square to prevent trouble after the prizegiving

But who can chronicle the glories of the Gihon Huntor their shames
Who remembers the kill in the marketplace when the Governor bade the
assembled sheikhs and warriors observe how the hounds would instantly
devour the body of Abu Hussein but how when he had scientifically
broken it up the weary pack turned from it in loathing and Farag wept
because he said the worlds face had been blackened What men who have
not yet ridden beyond the sound of any horn recall the midnight run
which endedBeagleboy leadingamong tombs the hasty whipoff and the
oath taken Abo e bones to forget the worry The desert run when Abu
Hussein forsook the cultivation and made a sixmile point to earth in
a desolate khorwhen strange armed riders on camels swooped out of a
ravine and instead of giving battle offered to take the tired hounds
home on their beasts Which they did and vanished

Above all who remembers the death of Royal when a certain Sheikh
wept above the body of the stainless hound as it might have been his
sonsand that day the Hunt rode no more The badlykept logbook says
little of this but at the end of their second season fortynine brace
appears the dark entry New blood badly wanted They are beginning to
listen to beagleboy

     

The Inspector attended to the matter when his leave fell due

Remember said the Governor you must get us the best blood in
Englandreal dainty houndsexpense no object but dont trust your
own judgment Present my letters of introduction and take what they
give you

The Inspector presented his letters in a society where they make much
of horses more of hounds and are tolerably civil to men who can
ride They passed him from house to house mounted him according to his
merits and fed him after five years of goat chop and Worcester sauce
perhaps a thought too richly

The seat or castle where he made his great coup does not much matter
Four Masters of Foxhounds were at table and in a mellow hour the
Inspector told them stories of the Gihon Hunt He ended Ben said I
wasnt to trust my own judgment about hounds but I think there ought to
be a special tariff for Empiremakers

As soon as his hosts could speak they reassured him on this point

And now tell us about your first puppyshow all over again said one

And about the earthstoppin Was that all Bens own invention said
another

Wait a moment said a large cleanshaven mannot an MFHat the
end of the table Are your villagers habitually beaten by your Governor
when they fail to stop foxes holes

The tone and the phrase were enough even if as the Inspector confessed
afterwards the big blue doublechinned man had not looked so like
Beagleboy He took him on for the honour of Ethiopia

We only hunt twice a weeksometimes three times Ive never known a
man chastised more than four times a week unless theres a bye

The large looselipped man flung his napkin down came round the table
cast himself into the chair next the Inspector and leaned forward
earnestly so that he breathed in the Inspectors face

Chastised with what he said

With the kourbashon the feet A kourbash is a strip of old hippohide
with a sort of keel on it like the cutting edge of a boars tusk But
we use the rounded side for a first offender

And do any consequences follow this sort of thing For the victim I
meannot for you

Very rarely Let me be fair Ive never seen a man die under the lash
but gangrene may set up if the kourbash has been pickled

Pickled in what All the table was still and interested

In copperas of course Didnt you know that said the Inspector

Thank God I didnt The large man sputtered visibly

The Inspector wiped his face and grew bolder

You mustnt think were careless about our earthstoppers Weve a Hunt
fund for hot tar Tars a splendid dressing if the toenails arent
beaten off But huntin as large a country as we do we maynt be back
at that village for a month and if the dressings aint renewed and
gangrene sets in often as not you find your man pegging about on his
stumps Weve a wellknown local name for em down the river We call
em the Mudirs Cranes You see I persuaded the Governor only to
bastinado on one foot

On one foot The Mudirs Cranes The large man turned purple to the
top of his bald head Would you mind giving me the local word for
Mudirs Cranes

From a too wellstocked memory the Inspector drew one short adhesive
word which surprises by itself even unblushing Ethiopia He spelt it
out saw the large man write it down on his cuff and withdraw Then the
Inspector translated a few of its significations and implications to the
four Masters of Foxhounds He left three days later with eight couple of
the best hounds in Englanda free and a friendly and an ample gift from
four packs to the Gihon Hunt He had honestly meant to undeceive the
large blue mottled man but somehow forgot about it

The new draft marks a new chapter in the Hunts history From an
isolated phenomenon in a barge it became a permanent institution with
brickbuilt kennels ashore and an influence social political and
administrative coterminous with the boundaries of the province Ben
the Governor departed to England where he kept a pack of real dainty
hounds but never ceased to long for the old lawless lot His successors
were exofficio Masters of the Gihon Hunt as all Inspectors were Whips
For one reason Farag the kennel huntsman in khaki and puttees would
obey nothing under the rank of an Excellency and the hounds would obey
no one but Farag for another the best way of estimating crop returns
and revenue was by riding straight to hounds for a third though
Judges down the river issued signed and sealed landtitles to all lawful
owners yet public opinion along the river never held any such title
valid till it had been confirmed according to precedent by the
Governors hunting crop in the hunting field above the wilfully
neglected earth True the ceremony had been cut down to three mere
taps on the shoulder but Governors who tried to evade that much found
themselves and their office compassed about with a great cloud of
witnesses who took up their time with lawsuits and worse still
neglected the puppies The older sheikhs indeed stood out for the
unmeasurable beatings of the old daysthe sharper the punishment they
argued the surer the title but here the hand of modern progress was
against them and they contented themselves with telling tales of Ben
the first Governor whom they called the Father of Waterwheels and of
that heroic age when men horses and hounds were worth following

This same Modern Progress which brought dog biscuit and brass watertaps
to the kennels was at work all over the world Forces Activities and
Movements sprang into being agitated themselves coalesced and in
one political avalanche overwhelmed a bewildered and not in the least
intending it England The echoes of the New Era were borne into the
Province on the wings of inexplicable cables The Gihon Hunt read
speeches and sentiments and policies which amazed them and they
thanked God prematurely that their Province was too far off too hot
and too hard worked to be reached by those speakers or their policies
But they with others underestimated the scope and purpose of the New
Era

One by one the Provinces of the Empire were hauled up and baited hit
and held lashed under the belly and forced back on their haunches for
the amusement of their new masters in the parish of Westminster One by
one they fell away sore and angry to compare stripes with each other
at the ends of the uneasy earth Even so the Gihon Hunt like Abu
Hussein in the old days did not understand Then it reached
them through the Press that they habitually flogged to death good
revenuepaying cultivators who neglected to stop earths but that
the few the very few who did not die under hippohide whips soaked in
copperas walked about on their gangrenous anklebones and were known
in derision as the Mudirs Cranes The charges were vouched for in
the House of Commons by a Mr Lethabie Groombride who had formed a
Committee and was disseminating literature The Province groaned the
Inspectornow an Inspector of Inspectorswhistled He had forgotten
the gentleman who sputtered in peoples faces

He shouldnt have looked so like Beagleboy was his sole defence when
he met the Governor at breakfast on the steamer after a meet

You shouldnt have joked with an animal of that class said Peter the
Governor Look what Farag has brought me

It was a pamphlet signed on behalf of a Committee by a lady secretary
but composed by some person who thoroughly understood the language of
the Province After telling the tale of the beatings it recommended
all the beaten to institute criminal proceedings against their Governor
and as soon as might be to rise against English oppression and
tyranny Such documents were new in Ethiopia in those days

The Inspector read the last half page Butbut he stammered this
is impossible White men dont write this sort of stuff

Dont they just said the Governor They get made Cabinet Ministers
for doing it too I went home last year I know

Itll blow over said the Inspector weakly

Not it Groombride is coming down here to investigate the matter in a
few days

For himself

The Imperial Governments behind him Perhaps youd like to look t my
orders The Governor laid down an uncoded cable The whiplash to it
ran You will afford Mr Groombride every facility for his inquiry
and will be held responsible that no obstacles are put in his way to
the fullest possible examination of any witnesses which he may consider
necessary He will be accompanied by his own interpreter who must not
be tampered with

Thats to meGovernor of the Province said Peter the Governor

It seems about enough the Inspector answered

Farag kennelhuntsman entered the saloon as was his privilege

My uncle who was beaten by the Father of Waterwheels would approach
O Excellency he said and there are others on the bank

Admit said the Governor

There tramped aboard sheikhs and villagers to the number of seventeen
In each mans hand was a copy of the pamphlet in each mans eye terror
and uneasiness of the sort that Governors spend and are spent to clear
away Farags uncle now Sheikh of the village spoke It is written in
this book Excellency that the beatings whereby we hold our lands are
all valueless It is written that every man who received such a beating
from the Father of Waterwheels who slow the Emirs should instantly
begin a lawsuit because the title to his land is not valid

It is so written We do not wish lawsuits We wish to hold the land as
it was given to us after the days of the Oppression they cried

The Governor glanced at the Inspector This was serious To cast doubt
on the ownership of land means in Ethiopia the letting in of waters
and the getting out of troops

Your titles are good said the Governor The Inspector confirmed with
a nod

Then what is the meaning of these writings which came from down the
river where the Judges are Farags uncle waved his copy By whose
order are we ordered to slay you O Excellency Our Governor

It is not written that you are to slay me

Not in those very words but if we leave an earth unstopped it is
the same as though we wished to save Abu Hussein from the hounds These
writings say Abolish your rulers How can we abolish except we kill
We hear rumours of one who comes from down the river soon to lead us to
kill

Fools said the Governor Your titles are good This is madness

It is so written they answered like a pack

Listen said the Inspector smoothly I know who caused the writings
to be written and sent He is a man of a bluemottled jowl in aspect
like Bigglebai who ate unclean matters He will come up the river and
will give tongue about the beatings

Will he impeach our landtitles An evil day for him

Go slow Baker the Governor whispered Theyll kill him if they get
scared about their land

I tell a parable The Inspector lit a cigarette Declare which of you
took to walk the children of Milkmaid

Melikmeid First or Second said Farag quickly

The secondthe one which was lamed by the thorn

Nono Melikmeid the Second strained her shoulder leaping my
waterchannel a sheikh cried Melikmeid the First was lamed by the
thorns on the day when Our Excellency fell thrice

Truetrue The second Melikmeids mate was Malvolio the pied hound
said the Inspector

I had two of the second Melikmeids pups said Farags uncle They
died of the madness in their ninth month

And how did they do before they died said the Inspector

They ran about in the sun and slavered at the mouth till they died

Wherefore

God knows He sent the madness It was no fault of mine

Thy own mouth hath answered thee The Inspector laughed It is with
men as it is with dogs God afflicts some with a madness It is no fault
of ours if such men run about in the sun and froth at the mouth The
man who is coming will emit spray from his mouth in speaking and will
always edge and push in towards his hearers When ye see and hear him ye
will understand that he is afflicted of God being mad He is in Gods
hands

But our titlesare our titles to our lands good the crowd repeated

Your titles are in my handsthey are good said the Governor

And he who wrote the writings is an afflicted of God said Farags
uncle

The Inspector hath said it cried the Governor Ye will see when the
man comes O sheikhs and men have we ridden together and walked puppies
together and bought and sold barley for the horses that after these
years we should run riot on the scent of a madmanan afflicted of God

But the Hunt pays us to kill mad jackals said Farags uncle And he
who questions my titles to my land

Aahh Ware riot The Governors huntingcrop cracked like a
threepounder By Allah he thundered if the afflicted of God come
to any harm at your hands I myself will shoot every hound and every
puppy and the Hunt shall ride no more On your heads be it Go in
peace and tell the others

The Hunt shall ride no more said Farags uncle Then how can the
land be governed Nono O Excellency Our Governor we will not harm
a hair on the head of the afflicted of God He shall be to us as is Abu
Husseins wife in the breeding season

When they were gone the Governor mopped his forehead

We must put a few soldiers in every village this Groombride visits
Baker Tell em to keep out of sight and have an eye on the villagers
Hes trying em rather high

O Excellency said the smooth voice of Farag laying the Field and
Country Life square on the table is the afflicted of God who resembles
Bigglebai one with the man whom the Inspector met in the great house in
England and to whom he told the tale of the Mudirs Cranes

The same man Farag said the Inspector

I have often heard the Inspector tell the tale to Our Excellency at
feedingtime in the kennels but since I am in the Government service
I have never told it to my people May I loose that tale among the
villages

     

The Governor nodded No harm said he

The details of Mr Groombrides arrival with his interpreter whom he
proposed should eat with him at the Governors table his allocution
to the Governor on the New Movement and the sins of Imperialism I
purposely omit At three in the afternoon Mr Groombride said I will
go out now and address your victims in this village

Wont you find it rather hot said the Governor They generally take
a nap till sunset at this time of year

Mr Groombrides large loose lips set That he replied pointedly
would be enough to decide me I fear you have not quite mastered your
instructions May I ask you to send for my interpreter I hope he has
not been tampered with by your subordinates

He was a yellowish boy called Abdul who had well eaten and drunk with
Farag The Inspector by the way was not present at the meal

At whatever risk I shall go unattended said Mr Groombride Your
presence would cow themfrom giving evidence Abdul my good friend
would you very kindly open the umbrella

He passed up the gangplank to the village and with no more prelude
than a Salvation Army picket in a Portsmouth slum cried Oh my
brothers

He did not guess how his path had been prepared The village was
widely awake Farag in loose flowing garments quite unlike a kennel
huntsmans khaki and puttees leaned against the wall of his uncles
house Come and see the afflicted of God he cried musically whose
face indeed resembles that of Bigglebai

The village came and decided that on the whole Farag was right

I cant quite catch what they are saying said Mr Groombride

They saying they very much pleased to see you Sar Adbul interpreted

Then I do think they might have sent a deputation to the steamer but
I suppose they were frightened of the officials Tell them not to be
frightened Abdul

He says you are not to be frightened Abdul explained A child
here sputtered with laughter Refrain from mirth Farag cried The
afflicted of God is the guest of The Excellency Our Governor We are
responsible for every hair of his head

He has none a voice spoke He has the white and the shining mange

Now tell them what I have come for Abdul and please keep the umbrella
well up I think I shall reserve myself for my little vernacular speech
at the end

Approach Look Listen Abdul chanted The afflicted of God will now
make sport Presently he will speak in your tongue and will consume
you with mirth I have been his servant for three weeks I will tell you
about his undergarments and his perfumes for his head

He told them at length

And didst thou take any of his perfume bottles said Farag at the end

I am his servant I took two Abdul replied

Ask him said Farags uncle what he knows about our landtitles Ye
young men are all alike He waved a pamphlet Mr Groombride smiled to
see how the seed sown in London had borne fruit by Gihon Lo All the
seniors held copies of the pamphlet

He knows less than a buffalo He told me on the steamer that he was
driven out of his own land by DemahKerazi which is a devil inhabiting
crowds and assemblies said Abdul

Allah between us and evil a woman cackled from the darkness of a hut
Come in children he may have the Evil Eye

No my aunt said Farag No afflicted of God has an evil eye Wait
till ye hear his mirthprovoking speech which he will deliver I have
heard it twice from Abdul

They seem very quick to grasp the point How far have you got Abdul

All about the beatings sar They are highly interested

Dont forget about the local selfgovernment and please hold the
umbrella over me It is hopeless to destroy unless one first builds up

He may not have the Evil Eye Farags uncle grunted but his devil
led him too certainly to question my landtitle Ask him whether he
still doubts my landtitle

Or mine or mine cried the elders

What odds He is an afflicted of God Farag called Remember the tale
I told you

Yes but he is an Englishman and doubtless of influence or Our
Excellency would not entertain him Bid the downcountry jackass ask
him

Sar said Abdul these people much fearing they may be turned out
of their land in consequence of your remarks Therefore they ask you to
make promise no bad consequences following your visit

Mr Groombride held his breath and turned purple Then he stamped his
foot

Tell them he cried that if a hair of any one of their heads is
touched by any official on any account whatever all England shall ring
with it Good God What callous oppression The dark places of the
earth are full of cruelty He wiped his face and throwing out his arms
cried Tell them oh tell the poor serfs not to be afraid of me Tell
them I come to redress their wrongsnot heaven knows to add to their
burden

The longdrawn gurgle of the practised public speaker pleased them much

That is how the new watertap runs out in the kennel said Farag The
Excellency Our Governor entertains him that he may make sport Make him
say the mirthmoving speech

What did he say about my landtitles Farags uncle was not to be
turned

He says Farag interpreted that he desires nothing better than that
you should live on your lands in peace He talks as though he believed
himself to be Governor

Well We here are all witnesses to what he has said Now go forward
with the sport Farags uncle smoothed his garments How diversely
hath Allah made His creatures On one He bestows strength to slay Emirs
another He causes to go mad and wander in the sun like the afflicted
sons of Melikmeid

Yes and to emit spray from the mouth as the Inspector told us All
will happen as the Inspector foretold said Farag I have never yet
seen the Inspector thrown out during any run

I think Abdul plucked at Mr Groombrides sleeves I think perhaps
it is better now Sar if you give your fine little native speech They
not understanding English but much pleased at your condescensions

Condescensions Mr Groombride spun round If they only knew how
I felt towards them in my heart If I could express a tithe of my
feelings I must stay here and learn the language Hold up the umbrella
Abdull I think my little speech will show them I know something of their
vie intime

It was a short simple carefully learned address and the accent
supervised by Abdul on the steamer allowed the hearers to guess its
meaning which was a request to see one of the Mudirs Cranes since the
desire of the speakers life the object to which he would consecrate
his days was to improve the condition of the Mudirs Cranes But first
he must behold them with his own eyes Would then his brethren whom
he loved show him a Mudirs Crane whom he desired to love

Once twice and again in his peroration he repeated his demand
using alwaysthat they might see he was acquainted with their local
argotusing always I say the word which the Inspector had given
him in England long agothe short adhesive word which by itself
surprises even unblushing Ethiopia

There are limits to the sublime politeness of an ancient people A
bulky bluechinned man in white clothes his name redlettered across
his lower shirtfront spluttering from under a greenlined umbrella
almost tearful appeals to be introduced to the Unintroducible naming
loudly the Unnameable dancing as it seemed in perverse joy at mere
mention of the Unmentionablefound those limits There was a moments
hush and then such mirth as Gihon through his centuries had never
hearda roar like to the roar of his own cataracts in flood Children
cast themselves on the ground and rolled back and forth cheering and
whooping strong men their faces hidden in their clothes swayed in
silence till the agony became insupportable and they threw up their
heads and bayed at the sun women mothers and virgins shrilled shriek
upon mounting shriek and slapped their thighs as it might have been the
roll of musketry When they tried to draw breath some halfstrangled
voice would quack out the word and the riot began afresh Last to fall
was the citytrained Abdul He held on to the edge of apoplexy then
collapsed throwing the umbrella from him

Mr Groombride should not be judged too harshly Exercise and strong
emotion under a hot sun the shock of public ingratitude for the moment
rued his spirit He furled the umbrella and with t beat the prostrate
Abdul crying that he had been betrayed In which posture the Inspector
on horseback followed by the Governor suddenly found him

     

Thats all very well said the Inspector when he had taken Abduls
dramatically dying depositions on the steamer but you cant hammer a
native merely because he laughs at you I see nothing for it but the law
to take its course

You might reduce the charge toertampering with an interpreter
said the Governor Mr Groombride was too far gone to be comforted

Its the publicity that I fear he wailed Is there no possible
means of hushing up the affair You dont know what a questiona single
question in the House means to a man of my positionthe ruin of my
political career I assure you

I shouldnt have imagined it said the Governor thoughtfully

And though perhaps I ought not to say it I am not without honour
in my own countryor influence A word in season as you know Your
Excellency It might carry an official far

The Governor shuddered

Yes that had to come too he said to himself Well look here If I
tell this man of yours to withdraw the charge against you you can go
to Gehenna for aught I care The only condition I make is that if you
writeI suppose thats part of your business about your travels you
dont praise me

So far Mr Groombride has loyally adhered to this understanding




GALLIOS SONG

 All day long to the judgmentseat
 The crazed Provincials drew
 All day long at their rulers feet
 Howled for the blood of the Jew
 Insurrection with one accord
 Banded itself and woke
 And Paul was about to open his mouth
 When Achaias Deputy spoke

 Whether the God descend from above
 Or the man ascend upon high
 Whether this maker of tents be Jove
 Or a younger deity
 I will be no judge between your gods
 And your godless bickerings
 Lictor drive them hence with rods
 I care for none of these things

 Were it a question of lawful due
 Or a labourers hire denied
 Reason would I should bear with you
 And order it well to be tried
 But this is a question of words and names
 And I know the strife it brings
 I will not pass upon any your claims
 I care for none of these things

 One thing only I see most clear
 As I pray you also see
 Claudius Caesar hath set me here
 Romes Deputy to be
 It is Her peace that ye go to break
 Not mine nor any kings
 But touching your clamour of conscience sake
 I care for none of these things




THE HOUSE SURGEON

On an evening after Easter Day I sat at a table in a homeward bound
steamers smokingroom where half a dozen of us told ghost stories As
our party broke up a man playing Patience in the next alcove said to
me I didnt quite catch the end of that last story about the Curse on
the familys firstborn

It turned out to be drains I explained As soon as new ones were put
into the house the Curse was lifted I believe I never knew the people
myself

Ah Ive had my drains up twice Im on gravel too

You dont mean to say youve a ghost in your house Why didnt you join
our party

Any more orders gentlemen before the bar closes the steward
interrupted

Sit down again and have one with me said the Patience player No
it isnt a ghost Our trouble is more depression than anything else

How interesting Then its nothing any one can see

Itsits nothing worse than a little depression And the odd part is
that there hasnt been a death in the house since it was builtin 1863
The lawyer said so That decided memy good lady rather and he made me
pay an extra thousand for it

How curious Unusual too I said

Yes aint it It was built for three sistersMoultrie was the
namethree old maids They all lived together the eldest owned it I
bought it from her lawyer a few years ago and if Ive spent a pound
on the place first and last I must have spent five thousand Electric
light new servants wing gardenall that sort of thing A man and his
family ought to be happy after so much expense aint it He looked at
me through the bottom of his glass

Does it affect your family much

My good ladyshes a Greek by the wayand myself are middleaged We
can bear up against depression but its hard on my little girl I say
little but shes twenty We send her visiting to escape it She almost
lived at hotels and hydros last year but that isnt pleasant for her
She used to be a canarya perfect canaryalways singing You ought to
hear her She doesnt sing now That sort of things unwholesome for the
young aint it

Cant you get rid of the place I suggested

Not except at a sacrifice and we are fond of it Just suits us three
Wed love it if we were allowed

What do you mean by not being allowed

I mean because of the depression It spoils everything

Whats it like exactly

I couldnt very well explain It must be seen to be appreciated as the
auctioneers say Now I was much impressed by the story you were telling
just now

It wasnt true I said

My tale is true If you would do me the pleasure to come down and spend
a night at my little place youd learn more than you would if I talked
till morning Very likely twouldnt touch your good self at all
You might beimmune aint it On the other hand if this
influenzainfluence does happen to affect you why I think it will be
an experience

While he talked he gave me his card and I read his name was L Maxwell
MLeod Esq of Holmescroft A City address was tucked away in a
corner

My business he added used to be furs If you are interested in
fursIve given thirty years of my life to em

Youre very kind I murmured

Far from it I assure you I can meet you next Saturday afternoon
anywhere in London you choose to name and Ill be only too happy to
motor you down It ought to be a delightful run at this time of year the
rhododendrons will be out I mean it You dont know how truly I mean
it Very probablyit wont affect you at all AndI think I may say I
have the finest collection of narwhal tusks in the world All the best
skins and horns have to go through London and L Maxwell MLeod he
knows where they come from and where they go to Thats his business

For the rest of the voyage upchannel Mr MLeod talked to me of the
assembling preparation and sale of the rarer furs and told me things
about the manufacture of furlined coats which quite shocked me Somehow
or other when we landed on Wednesday I found myself pledged to spend
that weekend with him at Holmescroft

On Saturday he met me with a wellgroomed motor and ran me out in an
hour and a half to an exclusive residential district of dustless roads
and elegantly designed country villas each standing in from three to
five acres of perfectly appointed land He told me land was selling at
eight hundred pounds the acre and the new golf links whose Queen
Anne pavilion we passed had cost nearly twentyfour thousand pounds to
create

Holmescroft was a large twostoried low creepercovered residence
A verandah at the south side gave on to a garden and two tennis courts
separated by a tasteful iron fence from a most parklike meadow of five
or six acres where two Jersey cows grazed Tea was ready in the shade
of a promising copper beech and I could see groups on the lawn of
young men and maidens appropriately clothed playing lawn tennis in the
sunshine

A pretty scene aint it said Mr MLeod My good ladys sitting
under the tree and thats my little girl in pink on the far court But
Ill take you to your room and you can see em all later

He led me through a wide parquetfloored hall furnished in pale lemon
with huge Cloisonnee vases an ebonized and gold grand piano and banks
of pot flowers in Benares brass bowls up a pale oak staircase to a
spacious landing where there was a green velvet settee trimmed with
silver The blinds were down and the light lay in parallel lines on the
floors

He showed me my room saying cheerfully You may be a little tired One
often is without knowing it after a run through traffic Dont come down
till you feel quite restored We shall all be in the garden

My room was rather warm and smelt of perfumed soap I threw up the
window at once but it opened so close to the floor and worked so
clumsily that I came within an ace of pitching out where I should
certainly have ruined a rather lopsided laburnum below As I set about
washing off the journeys dust I began to feel a little tired But I
reflected I had not come down here in this weather and among these new
surroundings to be depressed so I began to whistle

And it was just then that I was aware of a little grey shadow as it
might have been a snowflake seen against the light floating at an
immense distance in the background of my brain It annoyed me and I
shook my head to get rid of it Then my brain telegraphed that it was
the forerunner of a swiftstriding gloom which there was yet time to
escape if I would force my thoughts away from it as a man leaping for
life forces his body forward and away from the fall of a wall But the
gloom overtook me before I could take in the meaning of the message I
moved toward the bed every nerve already aching with the foreknowledge
of the pain that was to be dealt it and sat down while my amazed and
angry soul dropped gulf by gulf into that horror of great darkness
which is spoken of in the Bible and which as auctioneers say must be
experienced to be appreciated

Despair upon despair misery upon misery fear after fear each causing
their distinct and separate woe packed in upon me for an unrecorded
length of time until at last they blurred together and I heard a click
in my brain like the click in the ear when one descends in a diving
bell and I knew that the pressures were equalised within and without
and that for the moment the worst was at an end But I knew also that
at any moment the darkness might come down anew and while I dwelt on
this speculation precisely as a man torments a raging tooth with his
tongue it ebbed away into the little grey shadow on the brain of its
first coming and once more I heard my brain which knew what would
recur telegraph to every quarter fox help release or diversion

The door opened and MLeod reappeared I thanked him politely saying
I was charmed with my room anxious to meet Mrs MLeod much refreshed
with my wash and so on and so forth Beyond a little stickiness at
the corners of my mouth it seemed to me that I was managing my words
admirably the while that I myself cowered at the bottom of unclimbable
pits MLeod laid his hand on my shoulder and said Youve got it now
already aint it

Yes I answered Its making me sick

It will pass off when you come outside I give you my word it will then
pass off Come

I shambled out behind him and wiped my forehead in the hall

You musnt mind he said I expect the run tired you My good lady is
sitting there under the copper beech

She was a fat woman in an apricotcoloured gown with a heavily powdered
face against which her black longlashed eyes showed like currants
in dough I was introduced to many fine ladies and gentlemen of those
parts Magnificently appointed landaus and covered motors swept in and
out of the drive and the air was gay with the merry outcries of the
tennis players

As twilight drew on they all went away and I was left alone with Mr
and Mrs MLeod while tall menservants and maidservants took away the
tennis and tea things Miss MLeod had walked a little down the drive
with a lighthaired young man who apparently knew everything about
every South American railway stock He had told me at tea that these
were the days of financial specialisation

I think it went off beautifully my dear said Mr MLeod to his wife
and to me You feel all right now aint it Of course you do

Mrs MLeod surged across the gravel Her husband skipped nimbly before
her into the south verandah turned a switch and all Holmescroft was
flooded with light

You can do that from your room also he said as they went in There
is something in money aint it

Miss MLeod came up behind me in the dusk We have not yet been
introduced she said but I suppose you are staying the night

Your father was kind enough to ask me I replied

She nodded Yes I know and you know too dont you I saw your face
when you came to shake hands with mamma You felt the depression very
soon It is simply frightful in that bedroom sometimes What do you
think it isbewitchment In Greece where I was a little girl it might
have been but not in England do you think Or do you

Cheer up Thea It will all come right he insisted

No papa She shook her dark head Nothing is right while it comes

It is nothing that we ourselves have ever done in our lives that I
will swear to you said Mrs MLeod suddenly And we have changed our
servants several times So we know it is not them

Never mind Let us enjoy ourselves while we can said Mr MLeod
opening the champagne

But we did not enjoy ourselves The talk failed There were long
silences

I beg your pardon I said for I thought some one at my elbow was
about to speak

Ah That is the other thing said Miss MLeod Her mother groaned

We were silent again and in a few seconds it must have been a live
grief beyond wordsnot ghostly dread or horror but aching helpless
griefoverwhelmed us each I felt according to his or her nature
and held steady like the beam of a burning glass Behind that pain I was
conscious there was a desire on somebodys part to explain something on
which some tremendously important issue hung

Meantime I rolled bread pills and remembered my sins MLeod considered
his own reflection in a spoon his wife seemed to be praying and the
girl fidgetted desperately with hands and feet till the darkness passed
onas though the malignant rays of a burningglass had been shifted
from us

There said Miss MLeod half rising Now you see what makes a happy
home Oh sell itsell it father mine and let us go away

But Ive spent thousands on it You shall go to Harrogate next week
Thea dear

Im only just back from hotels I am so tired of packing

Cheer up Thea It is over You know it does not often come here twice
in the same night I think we shall dare now to be comfortable

He lifted a dishcover and helped his wife and daughter His face was
lined and fallen like an old mans after debauch but his hand did not
shake and his voice was clear As he worked to restore us by speech
and action he reminded me of a greymuzzled collie herding demoralised
sheep

After dinner we sat round the diningroom fire the drawingroom might
have been under the Shadow for aught we knew talking with the intimacy
of gipsies by the wayside or of wounded comparing notes after a
skirmish By eleven oclock the three between them had given me every
name and detail they could recall that in any way bore on the house and
what they knew of its history

We went to bed in a fortifying blaze of electric light My one fear was
that the blasting gust of depression would returnthe surest way
of course to bring it I lay awake till dawn breathing quickly and
sweating lightly beneath what De Quincey inadequately describes as
the oppression of inexpiable guilt Now as soon as the lovely day was
broken I fell into the most terrible of all dreamsthat joyous one in
which all past evil has not only been wiped out of our lives but has
never been committed and in the very bliss of our assured innocence
before our loves shriek and change countenance we wake to the day we
have earned

It was a coolish morning but we preferred to breakfast in the south
verandah The forenoon we spent in the garden pretending to play games
that come out of boxes such as croquet and clock golf But most of the
time we drew together and talked The young man who knew all about South
American railways took Miss MLeod for a walk in the afternoon and at
five MLeod thoughtfully whirled us all up to dine in town

Now dont say you will tell the Psychological Society and that you
will come again said Miss MLeod as we parted Because I know you
will not

You should not say that said her mother You should say Goodbye
Mr Perseus Come again

Not him the girl cried He has seen the Medusas head

Looking at myself in the restaurants mirrors it seemed to me that I
had not much benefited by my weekend Next morning I wrote out all
my Holmescroft notes at fullest length in the hope that by so doing
I could put it all behind me But the experience worked on my mind as
they say certain imperfectly understood rays work on the body

I am less calculated to make a Sherlock Holmes than any man I know
for I lack both method and patience yet the idea of following up the
trouble to its source fascinated me I had no theory to go on except
a vague idea that I had come between two poles of a discharge and had
taken a shock meant for some one else This was followed by a feeling
of intense irritation I waited cautiously on myself expecting to be
overtaken by horror of the supernatural but my self persisted in
being humanly indignant exactly as though it had been the victim of
a practical joke It was in great pains and upheavalsthat I felt in
every fibre but its dominant idea to put it coarsely was to get back
a bit of its own By this I knew that I might go forward if I could find
the way

After a few days it occurred to me to go to the office of Mr JMM
Baxterthe solicitor who had sold Holmescroft to MLeod I explained I
had some notion of buying the place Would he act for me in the matter

Mr Baxter a large greyish throatyvoiced man showed no enthusiasm
I sold it to Mr MLeod he said It ud scarcely do for me to start
on the runningdown tack now But I can recommend

I know hes asking an awful price I interrupted and atop of it he
wants an extra thousand for what he calls your clean bill of health

Mr Baxter sat up in his chair I had all his attention

Your guarantee with the house Dont you remember it

Yes yes That no death had taken place in the house since it was
built I remember perfectly

He did not gulp as untrained men do when they lie but his jaws moved
stickily and his eyes turning towards the deed boxes on the wall
dulled I counted seconds one two threeone two three up to ten A
man I knew can live through ages of mental depression in that time

I remember perfectly His mouth opened a little as though it had
tasted old bitterness

Of course that sort of thing doesnt appeal to me I went on I dont
expect to buy a house free from death

Certainly not No one does But it was Mr MLeods fancyhis wifes
rather I believe and since we could meet itit was my duty to my
clients at whatever cost to my own feelingsto make him pay

Thats really why I came to you I understood from him you knew the
place well

Oh yes Always did It originally belonged to some connections of
mine

The Misses Moultrie I suppose How interesting They must have loved
the place before the country round about was built up

They were very fond of it indeed

I dont wonder So restful and sunny I dont see how they could have
brought themselves to part with it

Now it is one of the most constant peculiarities of the English that in
polite conversationand I had striven to be politeno one ever does or
sells anything for mere moneys sake

Miss Agnesthe youngestfell ill he spaced his words a little
and as they were very much attached to each other that broke up the
home

Naturally I fancied it must have been something of that kind
One doesnt associate the Staffordshire Moultries my Demon of
Irresponsibility at that instant created em withwith being hard
up

I dont know whether were related to them he answered importantly
We may be for our branch of the family comes from the Midlands

I give this talk at length because I am so proud of my first attempt at
detective work When I left him twenty minutes later with instructions
to move against the owner of Holmescroft with a view to purchase I was
more bewildered than any Doctor Watson at the opening of a story

Why should a middleaged solicitor turn plovers egg colour and drop his
jaw when reminded of so innocent and festal a matter as that no death
had ever occurred in a house that he had sold If I knew my English
vocabulary at all the tone in which he said the youngest sister fell
ill meant that she had gone out of her mind That might explain his
change of countenance and it was just possible that her demented
influence still hung about Holmescroft but the rest was beyond me

I was relieved when I reached MLeods City office and could tell him
what I had donenot what I thought

MLeod was quite willing to enter into the game of the pretended
purchase but did not see how it would help if I knew Baxter

Hes the only living soul I can get at who was connected with
Holmescroft I said

Ah Living soul is good said MLeod At any rate our little girl
will be pleased that you are still interested in us Wont you come down
some day this week

How is it there now I asked

He screwed up his face Simply frightful he said Thea is at
Droitwich

I should like it immensely but I must cultivate Baxter for the
present Youll be sure and keep him busy your end wont you

He looked at me with quiet contempt Do not be afraid I shall be a
good Jew I shall be my own solicitor

Before a fortnight was over Baxter admitted ruefully that MLeod
was better than most firms in the business We buyers were coy
argumentative shocked at the price of Holmescroft inquisitive and
cold by turns but Mr MLeod the seller easily met and surpassed us
and Mr Baxter entered every letter telegram and consultation at the
proper rates in a cinematographfilm of a bill At the end of a month
he said it looked as though MLeod thanks to him were really going
to listen to reason I was many pounds out of pocket but I had learned
something of Mr Baxter on the human side I deserved it Never in my
life have I worked to conciliate amuse and flatter a human being as I
worked over my solicitor

It appeared that he golfed Therefore I was an enthusiastic beginner
anxious to learn Twice I invaded his office with a bag MLeod lent it
full of the spelicans needed in this detestable game and a vocabulary
to match The third time the ice broke and Mr Baxter took me to his
links quite ten miles off where in a maze of tramway lines railroads
and nurserymaids we skelped our divotted way round nine holes like
barges plunging through head seas He played vilely and had never
expected to meet any one worse but as he realised my form I think
he began to like me for he took me in hand by the two hours together
After a fortnight he could give me no more than a stroke a hole and
when with this allowance I once managed to beat him by one he was
honestly glad and assured me that I should be a golfer if I stuck
to it I was sticking to it for my own ends but now and again my
conscience pricked me for the man was a nice man Between games he
supplied me with odd pieces of evidence such as that he had known the
Moultries all his life being their cousin and that Miss Mary the
eldest was an unforgiving woman who would never let bygones be
I naturally wondered what she might have against him and somehow
connected him unfavourably with mad Agnes

People ought to forgive and forget he volunteered one day between
rounds Specially where in the nature of things they cant be sure of
their deductions Dont you think so

It all depends on the nature of the evidence on which one forms ones
judgment I answered

Nonsense he cried Im lawyer enough to know that theres nothing in
the world so misleading as circumstantial evidence Never was

Why Have you ever seen men hanged on it

Hanged People have been supposed to be eternally lost on it his face
turned grey again I dont know how it is with you but my consolation
is that God must know He must Things that seem on the face of em like
murder or say suicide may appear different to God Heh

Thats what the murderer and the suicide can always hopeI suppose

I have expressed myself clumsily as usual The facts as God knows
emmay be differenteven after the most clinching evidence Ive
always said thatboth as a lawyer and a man but some people wontI
dont want to judge emwell say they cantbelieve it whereas I
say theres always a working chancea certaintythat the worst hasnt
happened He stopped and cleared his throat Now lets come on This
time next week I shall be taking my holiday

What links I asked carelessly while twins in a perambulator got out
of our line of fire

A potty little ninehole affair at a hydro in the Midlands My cousins
stay there Always will Not but what the fourth and the seventh holes
take some doing You could manage it though he said encouragingly
Youre doing much better Its only your approach shots that are weak

Youre right I cant approach for nuts I shall go to pieces while
youre awaywith no one to coach me I said mournfully

I havent taught you anything he said delighted with the compliment

I owe all Ive learned to you anyhow When will you come back

Look here he began I dont know your engagements but Ive no one
to play with at Burry Mills Never have Why couldnt you take a few
days off and join me there I warn you it will be rather dull Its a
throat and gout placebaths massage electricity and so forth But the
fourth and the seventh holes really take some doing

Im for the game I answered valiantly Heaven well knowing that I
hated every stroke and word of it

Thats the proper spirit As their lawyer I must ask you not to say
anything to my cousins about Holmescroft It upsets em Always did But
speaking as man to man it would be very pleasant for me if you could
see your way to

I saw it as soon as decency permitted and thanked him sincerely
According to my now welldeveloped theory he had certainly
misappropriated his aged cousins monies under power of attorney and
had probably driven poor Agnes Moultrie out of her wits but I wished
that he was not so gentle and goodtempered and innocent eyed

Before I joined him at Burry Mills Hydro I spent a night at
Holmescroft Miss MLeod had returned from her Hydro and first we made
very merry on the open lawn in the sunshine over the manners and customs
of the English resorting to such places She knew dozens of hydros and
warned me how to behave in them while Mr and Mrs MLeod stood aside
and adored her

Ah Thats the way she always comes back to us he said Pity it
wears off so soon aint it You ought to hear her sing With mirth thou
pretty bird

We had the house to face through the evening and there we neither
laughed nor sung The gloom fell on us as we entered and did not shift
till ten oclock when we crawled out as it were from beneath it

It has been bad this summer said Mrs MLeod in a whisper after we
realised that we were freed Sometimes I think the house will get up
and cry outit is so bad

How

Have you forgotten what comes after the depression

So then we waited about the small fire and the dead air in the room
presently filled and pressed down upon us with the sensation but words
are useless here as though some dumb and bound power were striving
against gag and bond to deliver its soul of an articulate word It
passed in a few minutes and I fell to thinking about Mr Baxters
conscience and Agnes Moultrie gone mad in the welllit bedroom
that waited me These reflections secured me a night during which I
rediscovered how from purely mental causes a man can be physically
sick but the sickness was bliss compared to my dreams when the birds
waked On my departure MLeod gave me a beautiful narwhals horn much
as a nurse gives a child sweets for being brave at a dentists

Theres no duplicate of it in the world he said else it would have
come to old Max MLeod and he tucked it into the motor Miss MLeod
on the far side of the car whispered Have you found out anything Mr
Perseus

I shook my head

Then I shall be chained to my rock all my life she went on Only
dont tell papa

I supposed she was thinking of the young gentleman who specialised in
South American rails for I noticed a ring on the third finger of her
left hand

I went straight from that house to Burry Mills Hydro keen for the first
time in my life on playing golf which is guaranteed to occupy the mind
Baxter had taken me a room communicating with his own and after lunch
introduced me to a tall horseheaded elderly lady of decided manners
whom a whitehaired maid pushed along in a bathchair through the
parklike grounds of the Hydro She was Miss Mary Moultrie and she
coughed and cleared her throat just like Baxter She sufferedshe
told me it was a Moultrie castemarkfrom some obscure form of chronic
bronchitis complicated with spasm of the glottis and in a dead flat
voice with a sunken eye that looked and saw not told me what washes
gargles pastilles and inhalations she had proved most beneficial From
her I was passed on to her younger sister Miss Elizabeth a small and
withered thing with twitching lips victim she told me to very
much the same sort of throat but secretly devoted to another set of
medicines When she went away with Baxter and the bathchair I fell
across a major of the Indian army with gout in his glassy eyes and a
stomach which he had taken all round the Continent He laid everything
before me and him I escaped only to be confided in by a matron with
a tendency to follicular tonsilitis and eczema Baxter waited hand and
foot on his cousins till five oclock trying as I saw to atone for
his treatment of the dead sister Miss Mary ordered him about like a
dog

I warned you it would be dull he said when we met in the
smokingroom

Its tremendously interesting I said But how about a look round the
links

Unluckily damp always affects my eldest cousin Ive got to buy her a
new bronchitiskettle Arthurs broke her old one yesterday

We slipped out to the chemists shop in the town and he bought a large
glittering tin thing whose workings he explained

Im used to this sort of work I come up here pretty often he said
Ive the family throat too

Youre a good man I said A very good man

He turned towards me in the evening light among the beeches and his
face was changed to what it might have been a generation before

You see he said huskily there was the youngestAgnes Before
she fell ill you know But she didnt like leaving her sisters Never
would He hurried on with his oddshaped load and left me among the
ruins of my black theories The man with that face had done Agnes
Moultrie no wrong

We never played our game I was waked between two and three in the
morning from my hygienic bed by Baxter in an ulster over orange and
white pyjamas which I should never have suspected from his character

My cousin has had some sort of a seizure he said Will you come I
dont want to wake the doctor Dont want to make a scandal Quick

So I came quickly and led by the whitehaired Arthurs in a jacket and
petticoat entered a doublebedded room reeking with steam and Friars
Balsam The electrics were all on Miss MaryI knew her by her
heightwas at the open window wrestling with Miss Elizabeth who
gripped her round the knees

Miss Marys hand was at her own throat which was streaked with blood

Shes done it Shes done it too Miss Elizabeth panted Hold her
Help me

Oh I say Women dont cut their throats Baxter whispered

My God Has she cut her throat the maid cried out and with no
warning rolled over in a faint Baxter pushed her under the washbasins
and leaped to hold the gaunt woman who crowed and whistled as she
struggled toward the window He took her by the shoulder and she struck
out wildly

All right Shes only cut her hand he said Wet towel quick

While I got that he pushed her backward Her strength seemed almost as
great as his I swabbed at her throat when I could and found no mark
then helped him to control her a little Miss Elizabeth leaped back to
bed wailing like a child

Tie up her hand somehow said Baxter Dont let it drip about the
place Shehe stepped on broken glass in his slippers she must have
smashed a pane

Miss Mary lurched towards the open window again dropped on her knees
her head on the sill and lay quiet surrendering the cut hand to me

What did she do Baxter turned towards Miss Elizabeth in the far bed

She was going to throw herself out of the window was the answer
I stopped her and sent Arthurs for you Oh we can never hold up our
heads again

Miss Mary writhed and fought for breath Baxter found a shawl which he
threw over her shoulders

Nonsense said he That isnt like Mary but his face worked when he
said it

You wouldnt believe about Aggie John Perhaps you will now said
Miss Elizabeth I saw her do it and shes cut her throat too

She hasnt I said Its only her hand

Miss Mary suddenly broke from us with an indescribable grunt flew
rather than ran to her sisters bed and there shook her as one furious
schoolgirl would shake another

No such thing she croaked How dare you think so you wicked little
fool

Get into bed Mary said Baxter Youll catch a chill

She obeyed but sat up with the grey shawl round her lean shoulders
glaring at her sister Im better now she panted Arthurs let me
sit out too long Wheres Arthurs The kettle

Never mind Arthurs said Baxter You get the kettle I hastened to
bring it from the side table Now Mary as God sees you tell me what
youve done

His lips were dry and he could not moisten them with his tongue

Miss Mary applied herself to the mouth of the kettle and between
indraws of steam said The spasm came on just now while I was asleep
I was nearly choking to death So I went to the window Ive done it
often before without waking any one Bessies such an old maid about
draughts I tell you I was choking to death I couldnt manage the
catch and I nearly fell out That window opens too low I cut my hand
trying to save myself Who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief
I wish you had had my throat Bessie I never was nearer dying She
scowled on us all impartially while her sister sobbed

From the bottom of the bed we heard a quivering voice Is she dead
Have they took her away Oh I never could bear the sight o blood

Arthurs said Miss Mary you are an hireling Go away

It is my belief that Arthurs crawled out on all fours but I was busy
picking up broken glass from the carpet

Then Baxter seated by the side of the bed began to crossexamine in
a voice I scarcely recognised No one could for an instant have doubted
the genuine rage of Miss Mary against her sister her cousin or her
maid and that a doctor should have been called in for she did me the
honour of calling me doctorwas the last drop She was choking with her
throat had rushed to the window for air had near pitched out and in
catching at the window bars had cut her hand Over and over she made
this clear to the intent Baxter Then she turned on her sister and
tonguelashed her savagely

You mustnt blame me Miss Bessie faltered at last You know what we
think of night and day

Im coming to that said Baxter Listen to me What you did
Mary misled four people into thinking youyou meant to do away with
yourself

Isnt one suicide in the family enough Oh God help and pity us You
couldnt have believed that she cried

The evidence was complete Now dont you think Baxters finger
wagged under her nosecant you think that poor Aggie did the same
thing at Holmescroft when she fell out of the window

She had the same throat said Miss Elizabeth Exactly the same
symptoms Dont you remember Mary

Which was her bedroom I asked of Baxter in an undertone

Over the south verandah looking on to the tennis lawn

I nearly fell out of that very window when I was at
Holmescroftopening it to get some air The sill doesnt come much
above your knees I said

You hear that Mary Mary do you hear What this gentleman says Wont
you believe that what nearly happened to you must have happened to
poor Aggie that night For Gods sakefor her sakeMary wont you
believe

There was a long silence while the steam kettle puffed

If I could have proofif I could have proof said she and broke into
most horrible tears

Baxter motioned to me and I crept away to my room and lay awake till
morning thinking more specially of the dumb Thing at Holmescroft which
wished to explain itself I hated Miss Mary as perfectly as though I had
known her for twenty years but I felt that alive or dead I should not
like her to condemn me

Yet at midday when I saw Miss Mary in her bathchair Arthurs behind
and Baxter and Miss Elizabeth on either side in the parklike grounds
of the Hydro I found it difficult to arrange my words

Now that you know all about it said Baxter aside after the first
strangeness of our meeting was over its only fair to tell you that
my poor cousin did not die in Holmescroft at all She was dead when they
found her under the window in the morning Just dead

Under that laburnum outside the window I asked for I suddenly
remembered the crooked evil thing

Exactly She broke the tree in falling But no death has ever taken
place in the house so far as we were concerned You can make yourself
quite easy on that point Mr MLeods extra thousand for what you
called the clean bill of health was something toward my cousins
estate when we sold It was my duty as their lawyer to get it for
themat any cost to my own feelings

I know better than to argue when the English talk about their duty So I
agreed with my solicitor

Their sisters death must have been a great blow to your cousins I
went on The bathchair was behind me

Unspeakable Baxter whispered They brooded on it day and night
No wonder If their theory of poor Aggie making away with herself was
correct she was eternally lost

Do you believe that she made away with herself

No thank God Never have And after what happened to Mary last night
I see perfectly what happened to poor Aggie She had the family throat
too By the way Mary thinks you are a doctor Otherwise she wouldnt
like your having been in her room

Very good Is she convinced now about her sisters death

Shed give anything to be able to believe it but shes a hard woman
and brooding along certain lines makes one groovy I have sometimes been
afraid of her reasonon the religious side dont you know Elizabeth
doesnt matter Brain of a hen Always had

Here Arthurs summoned me to the bathchair and the ravaged face
beneath its knitted Shetland wool hood of Miss Mary Moultrie

I need not remind you I hope of the seal of secrecyabsolute
secrecyin your profession she began Thanks to my cousins and my
sisters stupidity you have found out she blew her nose

Please dont excite her sir said Arthurs at the back

But my dear Miss Moultrie I only know what Ive seen of course
but it seems to me that what you thought was a tragedy in your sisters
case turns out on your own evidence so to speak to have been an
accidenta dreadfully sad onebut absolutely an accident

Do you believe that too she cried Or are you only saying it to
comfort me

I believe it from the bottom of my heart Come down to Holmescroft for
an hourfor half an hour and satisfy yourself

Of what You dont understand I see the house every dayevery night
I am always there in spiritwaking or sleeping I couldnt face it in
reality

But you must I said If you go there in the spirit the greater need
for you to go there in the flesh Go to your sisters room once more
and see the windowI nearly fell out of it myself Itsits awfully
low and dangerous That would convince you I pleaded

Yet Aggie had slept in that room for years she interrupted

Youve slept in your room here for a long time havent you But you
nearly fell out of the window when you were choking

That is true That is one thing true she nodded And I might have
been killed asperhaps Aggie was killed

In that case your own sister and cousin and maid would have said you
had committed suicide Miss Moultrie Come down to Holmescroft and go
over the place just once

You are lying she said quite quietly You dont want me to come down
to see a window It is something else I warn you we are Evangelicals
We dont believe in prayers for the dead As the tree falls

Yes I daresay But you persist in thinking that your sister committed
suicide

No No I have always prayed that I might have misjudged her

Arthurs at the bathchair spoke up Oh Miss Mary you would ave it
from the first that poor Miss Aggie ad made away with herself an of
course Miss Bessie took the notion from you Only MasterMister John
stood outandand Id ave taken my Bible oath you was making away
with yourself last night

Miss Mary leaned towards me one finger on my sleeve

If going to Holmescroft kills me she said you will have the murder
of a fellowcreature on your conscience for all eternity

Ill risk it I answered Remembering what torment the mere reflection
of her torments had cast on Holmescroft and remembering above all the
dumb Thing that filled the house with its desire to speak I felt that
there might be worse things

Baxter was amazed at the proposed visit but at a nod from that terrible
woman went off to make arrangements Then I sent a telegram to MLeod
bidding him and his vacate Holmescroft for that afternoon Miss Mary
should be alone with her dead as I had been alone

I expected untold trouble in transporting her but to do her justice
the promise given for the journey she underwent it without murmur
spasm or unnecessary word Miss Bessie pressed in a corner by the
window wept behind her veil and from time to time tried to take
hold of her sisters hand Baxter wrapped himself in his newly found
happiness as selfishly as a bridegroom for he sat still and smiled

So long as I know that Aggie didnt make away with herself he
explained I tell you frankly I dont care what happened Shes as hard
as a rockMary Always was She wont die

We led her out on to the platform like a blind woman and so got her
into the fly The halfhour crawl to Holmescroft was the most racking
experience of the day MLeod had obeyed my instructions There was no
one visible in the house or the gardens and the front door stood open

Miss Mary rose from beside her sister stepped forth first and entered
the hall

Come Bessie she cried

I darent Oh I darent

Come Her voice had altered I felt Baxter start Theres nothing to
be afraid of

Good heavens said Baxter Shes running up the stairs Wed better
follow

Lets wait below Shes going to the room

We heard the door of the bedroom I knew open and shut and we waited in
the lemoncoloured hall heavy with the scent of flowers

Ive never been into it since it was sold Baxter sighed What a
lovely restful plate it is Poor Aggie used to arrange the flowers

Restful I began but stopped of a sudden for I felt all over my
bruised soul that Baxter was speaking truth It was a light spacious
airy house full of the sense of wellbeing and peaceabove all things
of peace I ventured into the diningroom where the thoughtful MLeods
had left a small fire There was no terror there present or lurking
and in the drawingroom which for good reasons we had never cared
to enter the sun and the peace and the scent of the flowers worked
together as is fit in an inhabited house When I returned to the hall
Baxter was sweetly asleep on a couch looking most unlike a middleaged
solicitor who had spent a broken night with an exacting cousin

There was ample time for me to review it allto felicitate myself upon
my magnificent acumen barring some errors about Baxter as a thief
and possibly a murderer before the door above opened and Baxter
evidently a light sleeper sprang awake

Ive had a heavenly little nap he said rubbing his eyes with the
backs of his hands like a child Good Lord Thats not their step

But it was I had never before been privileged to see the Shadow
turned backward on the dialthe years ripped bodily off poor human
shouldersold sunken eyes filled and alightharsh lips moistened and
human

John Miss Mary called I know now Aggie didnt do it and She
didnt do it echoed Miss Mary

I did not think it wrong to say a prayer Miss Mary continued Not
for her soul but for our peace Then I was convinced

Then we got conviction the younger sister piped

Weve misjudged poor Aggie John But I feel she knows now Wherever
she is she knows that we know she is guiltless

Yes she knows I felt it too said Miss Elizabeth

I never doubted said John Baxter whose face was beautiful at that
hour Not from the first Never have

You never offered me proof John Now thank God it will not be the
same any more I can think henceforward of Aggie without sorrow She
tripped absolutely tripped across the hall What ideas these Jews
have of arranging furniture She spied me behind a big Cloisonnee vase
Ive seen the window she said remotely You took a great risk in
advising me to undertake such a journey However as it turns out
I forgive you and I pray you may never know what mental anguish means
Bessie Look at this peculiar piano Do you suppose Doctor these
people would offer one tea I miss mine

I will go and see I said and explored MLeods newbuilt servants
wing It was in the servants hall that I unearthed the MLeod family
bursting with anxiety

Tea for three quick I said If you ask me any questions now
I shall have a fit So Mrs MLeod got it and I was butler amid
murmured apologies from Baxter still smiling and selfabsorbed and
the cold disapproval of Miss Mary who thought the pattern of the china
vulgar However she ate well and even asked me whether I would not
like a cup of tea for myself

They went away in the twilightthe twilight that I had once feared
They were going to an hotel in London to rest after the fatigues of the
day and as their fly turned down the drive I capered on the door step
with the alldarkened house behind me

Then I heard the uncertain feet of the MLeods and bade them not to turn
on the lights but to feelto feel what I had done for the Shadow was
gone with the dumb desire in the air They drew short but afterwards
deeper breaths like bathers entering chill water separated one from
the other moved about the hall tiptoed upstairs raced down and then
Miss MLeod and I believe her mother though she denies this embraced
me I know MLeod did

It was a disgraceful evening To say we rioted through the house is to
put it mildly We played a sort of Blind Mans Buff along the darkest
passages in the unlighted drawingroom and little diningroom calling
cheerily to each other after each exploration that here and here and
here the troublehad removed itself We came up to the bedroommine
for the night againand sat the women on the bed and we men
on chairs drinking in blessed draughts of peace and comfort and
cleanliness of soul while I told them my tale in full and received
fresh praise thanks and blessings

When the servants returned from their days outing gave us a supper
of cold fried fish MLeod had sense enough to open no wine We had
been practically drunk since nightfall and grew incoherent on water and
milk

I like that Baxter said MLeod Hes a sharp man The death wasnt
in the house but he ran it pretty close aint it

And the joke of it is that he supposes I want to buy the place from
you I said Are you selling

Not for twice what I paid for itnow said MLeod Ill keep you in
furs all your life but not our Holmescroft

Nonever our Holmescroft said Miss MLeod Well ask him here on
Tuesday mamma They squeezed each others hands

Now tell me said Mrs MLeodthat tall one I saw out of the
scullery windowdid she tell you she was always here in the spirit I
hate her She made all this trouble It was not her house after she had
sold it What do you think

I suppose I answered she brooded over what she believed was her
sisters suicide night and dayshe confessed she didand her thoughts
being concentrated on this place they felt like alike a burning
glass

Burning glass is good said MLeod

I said it was like a light of blackness turned on us cried the girl
twiddling her ring That must have been when the tall one thought worst
about her sister and the house

Ah the poor Aggie said Mrs MLeod The poor Aggie trying to
tell every one it was not so No wonder we felt Something wished to say
Something Thea Max do you remember that night

We need not remember any more MLeod interrupted It is not our
trouble They have told each other now

Do you think then said Miss MLeod that those two the living
ones were actually told somethingupstairsin your in the room

I cant say At any rate they were made happy and they ate a big tea
afterwards As your father says it is not our trouble any longerthank
God

Amen said MLeod Now Thea let us have some music after all these
months With mirth thou pretty bird aint it You ought to hear
that

And in the halflighted hall Thea sang an old English song that I had
never heard before

 With mirth thou pretty bird rejoice
 Thy Makers praise enhanced
 Lift up thy shrill and pleasant voice
 Thy God is high advanced
 Thy food before He did provide
 And gives it in a fitting side
 Wherewith be thou sufficed
 Why shouldst thou now unpleasant be
 Thy wrath against God venting
 That He a little bird made thee
 Thy silly head tormenting
 Because He made thee not a man
 Oh Peace He hath well thought thereon
 Therewith be thou sufficed




THE RABBIS SONG

 IF THOUGHT can reach to Heaven
 On Heaven let it dwell
 For fear that Thought be given
 Like power to reach to Hell
 For fear the desolation
 And darkness of thy mind
 Perplex an habitation
 Which thou hast left behind

 Let nothing linger after
 No whispering ghost remain
 In wall or beam or rafter
 Of any hate or pain
 Cleanse and call home thy spirit
 Deny her leave to cast
 On aught thy heirs inherit
 The shadow of her past

 For think in all thy sadness
 What road our griefs may take
 Whose brain reflect our madness
 Or whom our terrors shake
 For think lest any languish
 By cause of thy distress
 The arrows of our anguish
 Fly farther than we guess

 Our lives our tears as water
 Are spilled upon the ground
 God giveth no man quarter
 Yet God a means hath found
 Though faith and hope have vanished
 And even love grows dim
 A means whereby His banished
 Be not expelled from Him
