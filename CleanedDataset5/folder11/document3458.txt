Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States unless a

of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance

Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date

Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding

to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium

PREFACE

vi1 To those leaning on the sustaining infinite today is
 big with blessings The wakeful shepherd beholds
vi3 the first faint morning beams ere cometh the full radiance
 of a risen day So shone the pale star to the prophet
 shepherds yet it traversed the night and came where in
vi6 cradled obscurity lay the Bethlehem babe the human
 herald of Christ Truth who would make plain to be
 nighted understanding the way of salvation through Christ
vi9 Jesus till across a night of error should dawn the morn
 ing beams and shine the guiding star of being The Wise
 men were led to behold and to follow this daystar of
vi12 divine Science lighting the way to eternal harmony

 The time for thinkers has come Truth independent
 of doctrines and timehonored systems knocks at the
vi15 portal of humanity Contentment with the past and
 the cold conventionality of materialism are crumbling
 away Ignorance of God is no longer the stepping
vi18 stone to faith The only guarantee of obedience is a
 right apprehension of Him whom to know aright is
 Life eternal Though empires fall the Lord shall
vi21 reign forever

 A book introduces new thoughts but it cannot make
 them speedily understood It is the task of the sturdy
vi24 pioneer to hew the tall oak and to cut the rough
 granite Future ages must declare what the pioneer
 has accomplished

vi27 Since the authors discovery of the might of Truth in
vii1 the treatment of disease as well as of sin her system has
 been fully tested and has not been found wanting but
vii3 to reach the heights of Christian Science man must live
 in obedience to its divine Principle To develop the full
 might of this Science the discords of corporeal sense
vii6 must yield to the harmony of spiritual sense even as the
 science of music corrects false tones and gives sweet con
 cord to sound

vii9 Theology and physics teach that both Spirit and
 matter are real and good whereas the fact is that
 Spirit is good and real and matter is Spirits oppo
vii12 site The question What is Truth is answered by
 demonstration by healing both disease and sin and
 this demonstration shows that Christian healing con
vii15 fers the most health and makes the best men On this
 basis Christian Science will have a fair fight Sickness
 has been combated for centuries by doctors using ma
vii18 terial remedies but the question arises Is there less
 sickness because of these practitioners A vigorous
 No is the response deducible from two connate
vii21 facts  the reputed longevity of the Antediluvians
 and the rapid multiplication and increased violence of
 diseases since the flood

vii24 In the authors work RETROSPECTION AND INTROSPEC
 TION may be found a biographical sketch narrating
 experiences which led her in the year 1866 to the dis
vii27 covery of the system that she denominated Christian
 Science As early as 1862 she began to write down and
 give to friends the results of her Scriptural study for
vii30 the Bible was her sole teacher but these compositions
 were crude the first steps of a child in the newly dis
 covered world of Spirit

ix1 She also began to jot down her thoughts on the
 main subject but these jottings were only infantile
ix3 lispings of Truth A child drinks in the outward world
 through the eyes and rejoices in the draught He is
 as sure of the worlds existence as he is of his own yet
ix6 he cannot describe the world He finds a few words
 and with these he stammeringly attempts to convey his
 feeling Later the tongue voices the more definite
ix9 thought though still imperfectly

 So was it with the author As a certain poet says of
 himself she lisped in numbers for the numbers
ix12 came Certain essays written at that early date are
 still in circulation among her first pupils but they are
 feeble attempts to state the Principle and practice of
ix15 Christian healing and are not complete nor satisfac
 tory expositions of Truth Today though rejoicing
 in some progress she still finds herself a willing dis
ix18 ciple at the heavenly gate waiting for the Mind of
 Christ

 Her first pamphlet on Christian Science was copy
ix21 righted in 1870 but it did not appear in print until
 1876 as she had learned that this Science must be
 1876 as she had learned that this Science must be
 demonstrated by healing before a work on the subject
ix24 could be profitably studied From 1867 until 1875
 copies were however in friendly circulation

 Before writing this work SCIENCE AND HEALTH she
ix27 made copious notes of Scriptural exposition which
 have never been published This was during the years
 1867 and 1868 These efforts show her comparative
ix30 ignorance of the stupendous Lifeproblem up to that
 time and the degrees by which she came at length
 to its solution but she values them as a parent
x1 may treasure the memorials of a childs growth and
 she would not have them changed

x3 The first edition of SCIENCE AND HEALTH was pub
 lished in 1875 Various books on mental healing have
 since been issued most of them incorrect in theory
x6 and filled with plagiarisms from SCIENCE AND HEALTH
 They regard the human mind as a healing agent
 whereas this mind is not a factor in the Principle of
x9 Christian Science A few books however which are
 based on this book are useful

 The author has not compromised conscience to suit
x12 the general drift of thought but has bluntly and hon
 estly given the text of Truth She has made no effort
 to embellish elaborate or treat in full detail so in
x15 finite a theme By thousands of wellauthenticated
 cases of healing she and her students have proved the
 worth of her teachings These cases for the most part
x18 have been abandoned as hopeless by regular medical
 attendants Few invalids will turn to God till all
 physical supports have failed because there is so little
x21 faith in His disposition and power to heal disease

 The divine Principle of healing is proved in the
 personal experience of any sincere seeker of Truth Its
x24 purpose is good and its practice is safer and more po
 tent than that of any other sanitary method The un
 biased Christian thought is soonest touched by Truth
x27 and convinced of it Only those quarrel with her
 method who do not understand her meaning or dis
 cerning the truth come not to the light lest their
x30 works be reproved No intellectual proficiency is req
 uisite in the learner but sound morals are most de
 sirable

xi1 Many imagine that the phenomena of physical heal
 ing in Christian Science present only a phase of the
xi3 action of the human mind which action in some unex
 plained way results in the cure of disease On the con
 trary Christian Science rationally explains that all
xi6 other pathological methods are the fruits of human
 faith in matter faith in the workings not of Spirit
 but of the fleshly mind which must yield to Science

xi9 The physical healing of Christian Science results
 now as in Jesus time from the operation of divine
 Principle before which sin and disease lose their real
xi12 ity in human consciousness and disappear as naturally
 and as necessarily as darkness gives place to light and
 sin to reformation Now as then these mighty works
xi15 are not supernatural but supremely natural They are
 the sign of Immanuel or God with us a divine
 influence ever present in human consciousness and re
xi18 peating itself coming now as was promised aforetime

 To preach deliverance to the captives of sense
 And recovering of sight to the blind
xi21 To set at liberty them that are bruised

 When God called the author to proclaim His Gospel
 to this age there came also the charge to plant and
xi24 water His vineyard

 The first school of Christian Science Mindhealing
 was started by the author with only one student in
xi27 Lynn Massachusetts about the year 1867 In 1881
 she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in
 Boston under the seal of the Commonwealth a law
xi30 relative to colleges having been passed which enabled
 her to get this institution chartered for medical pur
xii1 poses No charters were granted to Christian Scien
 tists for such institutions after 1883 and up to that
xii3 date hers was the only College of this character which
 had been established in the United States where
 Christian Science was first introduced

xii6 During seven years over four thousand students
 were taught by the author in this College Meanwhile
 she was pastor of the first established Church of
xii9 Christ Scientist President of the first Christian Sci
 entist Association convening monthly publisher of
 her own works and for a portion of this time sole
xii12 editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal
 the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists She
 closed her College October 29 1889 in the height of
xii15 its prosperity with a deeplying conviction that the
 next two years of her life should be given to the prep
 aration of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH which
xii18 was published in 1891 She retained her charter and
 as its President reopened the College in 1899 as auxil
 iary to her church Until June 10 1907 she had never
xii21 read this book throughout consecutively in order to elu
 cidate her idealism

 In the spirit of Christs charity as one who hopeth
xii24 all things endureth all things and is joyful to bear
 consolation to the sorrowing and healing to the sick
 she commits these pages to honest seekers for Truth

 CHAPTER I  PRAYER

 For verily I say unto you That whosoever shall say unto this
 mountain Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and
 shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those
 things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have
 whatsoever he saith Therefore I say unto you What things
 soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them
 and ye shall have them
 Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask
 Him  CHRIST JESUS

11 THE prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the
 sick is an absolute faith that all things are
13 possible to God a spiritual understanding of Him
 an unselfed love Regardless of what another may say
 or think on this subject I speak from experience
16 Prayer watching and working combined with selfim
 molation are Gods gracious means for accomplishing
 whatever has been successfully done for the Christian
19 ization and health of mankind

 Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine
 Mind Desire is prayer and no loss can occur from
112 trusting God with our desires that they may be
 moulded and exalted before they take form in words
 and in deeds

 Right motives

21 What are the motives for prayer Do we pray to
 make ourselves better or to benefit those who hear us
23 to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of
 men Are we benefited by praying Yes
 the desire which goes forth hungering after righteous
26 ness is blessed of our Father and it does not return
 unto us void

 Deity unchangeable

 God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more
29 than He has already done nor can the infinite do less
 than bestow all good since He is unchang
 ing wisdom and Love We can do more for
212 ourselves by humble fervent petitions but the Alllov
 ing does not grant them simply on the ground of lip
 service for He already knows all

215 Prayer cannot change the Science of being but it
 tends to bring us into harmony with it Goodness at
 tains the demonstration of Truth A request that
218 God will save us is not all that is required The mere
 habit of pleading with the divine Mind as one pleads
 with a human being perpetuates the belief in God as
221 humanly circumscribed an error which impedes spirit
 ual growth

 Gods standard

 God is Love Can we ask Him to be more God is
224 intelligence Can we inform the infinite Mind of any
 thing He does not already comprehend
 Do we expect to change perfection Shall
227 we plead for more at the open fount which is pour
 ing forth more than we accept The unspoken desire
 does bring us nearer the source of all existence and
230 blessedness

 Asking God to be God is a vain repetition God is
 the same yesterday and today and forever and
31 He who is immutably right will do right without being
 reminded of His province The wisdom of man is not
33 sufficient to warrant him in advising God

 The spiritual mathematics

 Who would stand before a blackboard and pray the
 principle of mathematics to solve the problem The
36 rule is already established and it is our
 task to work out the solution Shall we
 ask the divine Principle of all goodness to do His own
39 work His work is done and we have only to avail
 ourselves of Gods rule in order to receive His bless
 ing which enables us to work out our own salvation

312 The Divine Being must be reflected by man  else
 man is not the image and likeness of the patient
 tender and true the One altogether lovely but to
315 understand God is the work of eternity and demands
 absolute consecration of thought energy and desire

 Prayerful ingratitude

 How empty are our conceptions of Deity We admit
318 theoretically that God is good omnipotent omni
 present infinite and then we try to give
 information to this infinite Mind We plead
321 for unmerited pardon and for a liberal outpouring of
 benefactions Are we really grateful for the good
 already received Then we shall avail ourselves of the
324 blessings we have and thus be fitted to receive more
 Gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of
 thanks Action expresses more gratitude than speech

327 If we are ungrateful for Life Truth and Love and
 yet return thanks to God for all blessings we are in
 sincere and incur the sharp censure our Master pro
330 nounces on hypocrites In such a case the only
 acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and
 remember our blessings While the heart is far from
41 divine Truth and Love we cannot conceal the ingrati
 tude of barren lives

 Efficacious petitions

43 What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire
 for growth in grace expressed in patience meekness
 love and good deeds To keep the com
46 mandments of our Master and follow his
 example is our proper debt to him and the only
 worthy evidence of our gratitude for all that he has
49 done Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to
 express loyal and heartfelt gratitude since he has
 said If ye love me keep my commandments

412 The habitual struggle to be always good is unceas
 ing prayer Its motives are made manifest in the
 blessings they bring blessings which even if not
415 acknowledged in audible words attest our worthiness
 to be partakers of Love

 Watchfulness requisite

 Simply asking that we may love God will never
418 make us love Him but the longing to be better
 and holier expressed in daily watchful
 ness and in striving to assimilate more of
421 the divine character will mould and fashion us
 anew until we awake in His likeness We reach the
 Science of Christianity through demonstration of the
424 divine nature but in this wicked world goodness
 will be evil spoken of and patience must bring
 experience

 Veritable devotion

427 Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual
 understanding which regenerates but silent prayer
 watchfulness and devout obedience enable
430 us to follow Jesus example Long prayers
 superstition and creeds clip the strong pinions of love
 and clothe religion in human forms Whatever mate
51 rializes worship hinders mans spiritual growth and keeps
 him from demonstrating his power over error

 Sorrow and reformation

53 Sorrow for wrongdoing is but one step towards reform
 and the very easiest step The next and great step re
 quired by wisdom is the test of our sincerity
56  namely reformation To this end we are
 placed under the stress of circumstances Temptation
 bids us repeat the offence and woe comes in return for
59 what is done So it will ever be till we learn that there
 is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay
 the uttermost farthing The measure ye mete shall
512 be measured to you again and it will be full and run
 ning over

 Saints and sinners get their full award but not always
515 in this world The followers of Christ drank his cup
 Ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim but God
 pours the riches of His love into the understanding and
518 affections giving us strength according to our day Sin
 ners flourish like a green bay tree but looking farther
 the Psalmist could see their end  the destruction of sin
521 through suffering

 Cancellation of human sin

 Prayer is not to be used as a confessional to cancel sin
 Such an error would impede true religion Sin is forgiven
524 only as it is destroyed by Christ  Truth and
 Life If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is
 cancelled and that man is made better merely by praying
527 prayer is an evil He grows worse who continues in sin
 because he fancies himself forgiven

 Diabolism destroyed

 An apostle says that the Son of God Christ came to
530 destroy the works of the devil We should
 follow our divine Exemplar and seek the de
 struction of all evil works error and disease included
61 We cannot escape the penalty due for sin The Scrip
 tures say that if we deny Christ  he also will deny us

 Pardon and amendment

63 Divine Love corrects and governs man Men may
 pardon but this divine Principle alone reforms the
 sinner God is not separate from the wis
66 dom He bestows The talents He gives we
 must improve Calling on Him to forgive our work
 badly done or left undone implies the vain supposition
69 that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon and
 that afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence

 To cause suffering as the result of sin is the means
612 of destroying sin Every supposed pleasure in sin
 will furnish more than its equivalent of pain until be
 lief in material life and sin is destroyed To reach
615 heaven the harmony of being we must understand
 the divine Principle of being

 Mercy without partiality

 God is Love More than this we cannot ask
618 higher we cannot look farther we cannot go To
 suppose that God forgives or punishes sin
 according as His mercy is sought or un
621 sought is to misunderstand Love and to make prayer
 the safetyvalve for wrongdoing

 Divine severity

 Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before he cast it
624 out Of a sick woman he said that Satan had bound
 her and to Peter he said Thou art an of
 fence unto me He came teaching and
627 showing men how to destroy sin sickness and death
 He said of the fruitless tree It is hewn down

 It is believed by many that a certain magistrate
630 who lived in the time of Jesus left this record His
 rebuke is fearful The strong language of our Mas
 ter confirms this description

71 The only civil sentence which he had for error was
 Get thee behind me Satan Still stronger evidence
73 that Jesus reproof was pointed and pungent is found
 in his own words showing the necessity for such
 forcible utterance when he cast out devils and healed
76 the sick and sinning The relinquishment of error de
 prives material sense of its false claims

 Audible praying

 Audible prayer is impressive it gives momentary
79 solemnity and elevation to thought But does it pro
 duce any lasting benefit Looking deeply
 into these things we find that a zeal   
712 not according to knowledge gives occasion for reac
 tion unfavorable to spiritual growth sober resolve and
 wholesome perception of Gods requirements The mo
715 tives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of
 applause to induce or encourage Christian sentiment

 Emotional utterances

 Physical sensation not Soul produces material ec
718 stasy and emotion If spiritual sense always guided
 men there would grow out of ecstatic mo
 ments a higher experience and a better life
721 with more devout selfabnegation and purity A self
 satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes
 a Christian God is not influenced by man The di
724 vine ear is not an auditory nerve It is the allhearing
 and allknowing Mind to whom each need of man is
 always known and by whom it will be supplied

 Danger from audible prayer

727 The danger from prayer is that it may lead us into temp
 tation By it we may become involuntary hypocrites ut
 tering desires which are not real and consoling
730 ourselves in the midst of sin with the recollection
 that we have prayed over it or mean to ask for
 giveness at some later day Hypocrisy is fatal to religion

81 A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self
 justification though it makes the sinner a hypocrite
83 We never need to despair of an honest heart but
 there is little hope for those who come only spasmodi
 cally face to face with their wickedness and then seek to
86 hide it Their prayers are indexes which do not correspond
 with their character They hold secret fellowship with
 sin and such externals are spoken of by Jesus as like
89 unto whited sepulchres    full    of all uncleanness

 Aspiration and love

 If a man though apparently fervent and prayerful
 is impure and therefore insincere what must be the
812 comment upon him If he reached the
 loftiness of his prayer there would be no
 occasion for comment If we feel the aspiration hu
815 mility gratitude and love which our words express
 this God accepts and it is wise not to try to deceive
 ourselves or others for there is nothing covered that
818 shall not be revealed Professions and audible pray
 ers are like charity in one respect they cover the
 multitude of sins Praying for humility with what
821 ever fervency of expression does not always mean a
 desire for it If we turn away from the poor we are
 not ready to receive the reward of Him who blesses
824 the poor We confess to having a very wicked heart
 and ask that it may be laid bare before us but do
 we not already know more of this heart than we are
827 willing to have our neighbor see

 Searching the heart

 We should examine ourselves and learn what is the
 affection and purpose of the heart for in this way
830 only can we learn what we honestly are If a
 friend informs us of a fault do we listen pa
 tiently to the rebuke and credit what is said Do we not
91 rather give thanks that we are not as other men
 During many years the author has been most grateful
93 for merited rebuke The wrong lies in unmerited cen
 sure in the falsehood which does no one any good

 Summit of aspiration

 The test of all prayer lies in the answer to these
96 questions Do we love our neighbor better because of
 this asking Do we pursue the old selfish
 ness satisfied with having prayed for some
99 thing better though we give no evidence of the sin
 cerity of our requests by living consistently with our
 prayer If selfishness has given place to kindness
912 we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly and bless
 them that curse us but we shall never meet this great
 duty simply by asking that it may be done There is
915 a cross to be taken up before we can enjoy the fruition
 of our hope and faith

 Practical religion

 Dost thou love the Lord thy God with all thy
918 heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
 This command includes much even the sur
 render of all merely material sensation affec
921 tion and worship This is the El Dorado of Christianity
 It involves the Science of Life and recognizes only the
 divine control of Spirit in which Soul is our master
924 and material sense and human will have no place

 The chalice sacrificial

 Are you willing to leave all for Christ for Truth and
 so be counted among sinners No Do you really desire
927 to attain this point No Then why make long
 prayers about it and ask to be Christians
 since you do not care to tread in the footsteps of our
930 dear Master If unwilling to follow his example why
 pray with the lips that you may be partakers of his
 nature Consistent prayer is the desire to do right
101 Prayer means that we desire to walk and will walk in
 the light so far as we receive it even though with bleed
103 ing footsteps and that waiting patiently on the Lord
 we will leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him

 The world must grow to the spiritual understanding
106 of prayer If good enough to profit by Jesus cup of
 earthly sorrows God will sustain us under these sor
 rows Until we are thus divinely qualified and are
109 willing to drink his cup millions of vain repetitions
 will never pour into prayer the unction of Spirit in
 demonstration of power and with signs following
1012 Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the
 world the flesh and evil and thus destroying all error

 Seeking is not sufficient It is striving that enables
1015 us to enter Spiritual attainments open the door to a
 higher understanding of the divine Life

 Perfunctory prayers

 One of the forms of worship in Thibet is to carry a
1018 prayingmachine through the streets and stop at the
 doors to earn a penny by grinding out a
 prayer But the advance guard of progress has
1021 paid for the privilege of prayer the price of persecution

 Asking amiss

 Experience teaches us that we do not always receive
 the blessings we ask for in prayer There is some mis
1024 apprehension of the source and means of
 all goodness and blessedness or we should
 certainly receive that for which we ask The Scrip
1027 tures say Ye ask and receive not because ye ask
 amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts That
 which we desire and for which we ask it is not always
1030 best for us to receive In this case infinite Love will
 not grant the request Do you ask wisdom to be mer
 ciful and not to punish sin Then ye ask amiss
111 Without punishment sin would multiply Jesus prayer
 Forgive us our debts specified also the terms of
113 forgiveness When forgiving the adulterous woman he
 said Go and sin no more

 Remission of penalty

 A magistrate sometimes remits the penalty but this
116 may be no moral benefit to the criminal and at best it
 only saves the criminal from one form of
 punishment The moral law which has the
119 right to acquit or condemn always demands restitu
 tion before mortals can go up higher Broken law
 brings penalty in order to compel this progress

 Truth annihilates error

1112 Mere legal pardon and there is no other for divine
 Principle never pardons our sins or mistakes till they
 are corrected leaves the offender free to re
1115 peat the offence if indeed he has not already
 suffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it
 with loathing Truth bestows no pardon upon error but
1118 wipes it out in the most effectual manner Jesus suffered
 for our sins not to annul the divine sentence for an in
 dividuals sin but because sin brings inevitable suffering

 Desire for holiness

1121 Petitions bring to mortals only the results of mor
 tals own faith We know that a desire for holiness is
 requisite in order to gain holiness but if we
1124 desire holiness above all else we shall sac
 rifice everything for it We must be willing to do this
 that we may walk securely in the only practical road
1127 to holiness Prayer cannot change the unalterable
 Truth nor can prayer alone give us an understanding
 of Truth but prayer coupled with a fervent habitual
1130 desire to know and do the will of God will bring us
 into all Truth Such a desire has little need of audible
 expression It is best expressed in thought and in life

 Prayer for the sick

121 The prayer of faith shall save the sick says the
 Scripture What is this healing prayer A mere re
123 quest that God will heal the sick has no
 power to gain more of the divine presence
 than is always at hand The beneficial effect of
126 such prayer for the sick is on the human mind mak
 ing it act more powerfully on the body through a blind
 faith in God This however is one belief casting out
129 another  a belief in the unknown casting out a belief
 in sickness It is neither Science nor Truth which
 acts through blind belief nor is it the human under
1212 standing of the divine healing Principle as manifested
 in Jesus whose humble prayers were deep and con
 scientious protests of Truth  of mans likeness to
1215 God and of mans unity with Truth and Love

 Prayer to a corporeal God affects the sick like a
 drug which has no efficacy of its own but borrows its
1218 power from human faith and belief The drug does
 nothing because it has no intelligence It is a mortal
 belief not divine Principle or Love which causes a
1221 drug to be apparently either poisonous or sanative

 The common custom of praying for the recovery of the
 sick finds help in blind belief whereas help should come
1224 from the enlightened understanding Changes in belief
 may go on indefinitely but they are the merchandise of
 human thought and not the outgrowth of divine Science

 Love impartial and universal

1227 Does Deity interpose in behalf of one worshipper
 and not help another who offers the same measure of
 prayer If the sick recover because they
1230 pray or are prayed for audibly only peti
 tioners per se or by proxy should get well In divine
 Science where prayers are mental all may avail them
131 selves of God as a very present help in trouble
 Love is impartial and universal in its adaptation and
133 bestowals It is the open fount which cries Ho
 every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters

 Public exaggerations

 In public prayer we often go beyond our convictions
136 beyond the honest standpoint of fervent desire If we
 are not secretly yearning and openly striv
 ing for the accomplishment of all we ask
139 our prayers are vain repetitions such as the heathen
 use If our petitions are sincere we labor for what we
 ask and our Father who seeth in secret will reward
1312 us openly Can the mere public expression of our de
 sires increase them Do we gain the omnipotent ear
 sooner by words than by thoughts Even if prayer is
1315 sincere God knows our need before we tell Him or our
 fellowbeings about it If we cherish the desire hon
 estly and silently and humbly God will bless it and
1318 we shall incur less risk of overwhelming our real
 wishes with a torrent of words

 Corporeal ignorance

 If we pray to God as a corporeal person this will
1321 prevent us from relinquishing the human doubts and
 fears which attend such a belief and so we
 cannot grasp the wonders wrought by infi
1324 nite incorporeal Love to whom all things are possible
 Because of human ignorance of the divine Principle
 Love the Father of all is represented as a corporeal
1327 creator hence men recognize themselves as merely
 physical and are ignorant of man as Gods image or re
 flection and of mans eternal incorporeal existence The
1330 world of error is ignorant of the world of Truth  blind
 to the reality of mans existence  for the world of sen
 sation is not cognizant of life in Soul not in body

 Bodily presence

141 If we are sensibly with the body and regard omnipo
 tence as a corporeal material person whose ear we
143 would gain we are not absent from the
 body and present with the Lord in the
 demonstration of Spirit We cannot serve two mas
146 ters To be present with the Lord is to have not
 mere emotional ecstasy or faith but the actual demon
 stration and understanding of Life as revealed in
149 Christian Science To be with the Lord is to be in
 obedience to the law of God to be absolutely governed
 by divine Love by Spirit not by matter

 Spiritualized consciousness

1412 Become conscious for a single moment that Life and
 intelligence are purely spiritual  neither in nor of
 matter  and the body will then utter no
1415 complaints If suffering from a belief in
 sickness you will find yourself suddenly well Sorrow
 is turned into joy when the body is controlled by spir
1418 itual Life Truth and Love Hence the hope of the
 promise Jesus bestows He that believeth on me
 the works that I do shall he do also    because I
1421 go unto my Father  because the Ego is absent from
 the body and present with Truth and Love The
 Lords Prayer is the prayer of Soul not of material
1424 sense

 Entirely separate from the belief and dream of mate
 rial living is the Life divine revealing spiritual under
1427 standing and the consciousness of mans dominion
 over the whole earth This understanding casts out
 error and heals the sick and with it you can speak
1430 as one having authority

 When thou prayest enter into thy closet and
 when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy Father
151 which is in secret and thy Father which seeth in
 secret shall reward thee openly

 Spiritual sanctuary

153 So spake Jesus The closet typifies the sanctuary of
 Spirit the door of which shuts out sinful sense but
 lets in Truth Life and Love Closed to
156 error it is open to Truth and vice versa
 The Father in secret is unseen to the physical senses
 but He knows all things and rewards according to
159 motives not according to speech To enter into the
 heart of prayer the door of the erring senses must be
 closed Lips must be mute and materialism silent
1512 that man may have audience with Spirit the divine
 Principle Love which destroys all error

 Effectual invocation

 In order to pray aright we must enter into the
1515 closet and shut the door We must close the lips and
 silence the material senses In the quiet
 sanctuary of earnest longings we must
1518 deny sin and plead Gods allness We must resolve to
 take up the cross and go forth with honest hearts to
 work and watch for wisdom Truth and Love We
1521 must pray without ceasing Such prayer is an
 swered in so far as we put our desires into practice
 The Masters injunction is that we pray in secret and
1524 let our lives attest our sincerity

 Trustworthy beneficence

 Christians rejoice in secret beauty and bounty hidden
 from the world but known to God Selfforgetfulness
1527 purity and affection are constant prayers
 Practice not profession understanding not
 belief gain the ear and right hand of omnipotence and
1530 they assuredly call down infinite blessings Trustworthi
 ness is the foundation of enlightened faith Without a
 fitness for holiness we cannot receive holiness

 Loftiest adoration

161 A great sacrifice of material things must precede this
 advanced spiritual understanding The highest prayer
163 is not one of faith merely it is demonstra
 tion Such prayer heals sickness and must
 destroy sin and death It distinguishes between Truth
166 that is sinless and the falsity of sinful sense

 The prayer of Jesus Christ

 Our Master taught his disciples one brief prayer
 which we name after him the Lords Prayer Our Mas
169 ter said After this manner therefore pray
 ye and then he gave that prayer which
 covers all human needs There is indeed some doubt
1612 among Bible scholars whether the last line is not an
 addition to the prayer by a later copyist but this does
 not affect the meaning of the prayer itself

1615 In the phrase Deliver us from evil the original
 properly reads Deliver us from the evil one This
 reading strengthens our scientific apprehension of the peti
1618 tion for Christian Science teaches us that the evil one or
 one evil is but another name for the first lie and all liars

 Only as we rise above all material sensuousness and
1621 sin can we reach the heavenborn aspiration and spir
 itual consciousness which is indicated in the Lords
 Prayer and which instantaneously heals the sick
1624 Here let me give what I understand to be the spir
 itual sense of the Lords Prayer

 Our Father which art in heaven
1627 Our FatherMother God allharmonious

 Hallowed be Thy name
 Adorable One

1630 Thy kingdom come
 Thy kingdom is come Thou art everpresent

171 Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
 Enable us to know as in heaven so on earth God is
173 omnipotent supreme

 Give us this day our daily bread
 Give us grace for today feed the famished affections

176 And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
 And Love is reflected in love

 And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from
179 evil
 And God leadeth us not into temptation but delivereth
 us from sin disease and death

1712 For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the
 glory forever
 For God is infinite allpower all Life Truth Love over
 all and All




 CHAPTER II  ATONEMENT AND EUCHARIST

 And they that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the
 affections and lusts  PAUL

 For Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel
  PAUL

 For I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine
 until the kingdom of God shall come  JESUS

 Divine oneness

181 ATONEMENT is the exemplification of mans unity
 with God whereby man reflects divine Truth Life
183 and Love Jesus of Nazareth taught and demonstrated
 mans oneness with the Father and for this we owe him
 endless homage His mission was both in
186 dividual and collective He did lifes work
 aright not only in justice to himself but in mercy to
 mortals to show them how to do theirs but not to do
189 it for them nor to relieve them of a single responsibility
 Jesus acted boldly against the accredited evidence of the
 senses against Pharisaical creeds and practices and he
1812 refuted all opponents with his healing power

 Human reconciliation

 The atonement of Christ reconciles man to God not
 God to man for the divine Principle of Christ is God
1815 and how can God propitiate Himself Christ
 is Truth which reaches no higher than itself
 The fountain can rise no higher than its source Christ
1818 Truth could conciliate no nature above his own derived
191 from the eternal Love It was therefore Christs purpose
 to reconcile man to God not God to man Love and
193 Truth are not at war with Gods image and likeness
 Man cannot exceed divine Love and so atone for him
 self Even Christ cannot reconcile Truth to error for
196 Truth and error are irreconcilable Jesus aided in recon
 ciling man to God by giving man a truer sense of Love
 the divine Principle of Jesus teachings and this truer
199 sense of Love redeems man from the law of matter
 sin and death by the law of Spirit the law of divine
 Love

1912 The Master forbore not to speak the whole truth de
 claring precisely what would destroy sickness sin and
 death although his teaching set households at variance
1915 and brought to material beliefs not peace but a
 sword

 Efficacious repentance

 Every pang of repentance and suffering every effort
1918 for reform every good thought and deed will help us to
 understand Jesus atonement for sin and aid
 its efficacy but if the sinner continues to pray
1921 and repent sin and be sorry he has little part in the atone
 ment in the atonement with God for he lacks the
 practical repentance which reforms the heart and enables
1924 man to do the will of wisdom Those who cannot dem
 onstrate at least in part the divine Principle of the teach
 ings and practice of our Master have no part in God If
1927 living in disobedience to Him we ought to feel no secur
 ity although God is good

 Jesus sinless career

 Jesus urged the commandment Thou shalt have no
1930 other gods before me which may be ren
 dered Thou shalt have no belief of Life as
 mortal thou shalt not know evil for there is one Life
201 even God good He rendered unto Caesar the things
 which are Caesars and unto God the things that are
203 Gods He at last paid no homage to forms of doctrine
 or to theories of man but acted and spake as he was moved
 not by spirits but by Spirit

206 To the ritualistic priest and hypocritical Pharisee
 Jesus said The publicans and the harlots go into the
 kingdom of God before you Jesus history made a
209 new calendar which we call the Christian era but he
 established no ritualistic worship He knew that men
 can be baptized partake of the Eucharist support the
2012 clergy observe the Sabbath make long prayers and yet
 be sensual and sinful

 Perfect example

 Jesus bore our infirmities he knew the error of mortal
2015 belief and with his stripes the rejection of error we are
 healed Despised and rejected of men
 returning blessing for cursing he taught mor
2018 tals the opposite of themselves even the nature of God
 and when error felt the power of Truth the scourge and
 the cross awaited the great Teacher Yet he swerved not
2021 well knowing that to obey the divine order and trust God
 saves retracing and traversing anew the path from sin to
 holiness

 Behest of the cross

2024 Material belief is slow to acknowledge what the
 spiritual fact implies The truth is the centre of all
 religion It commands sure entrance into
2027 the realm of Love St Paul wrote Let us
 lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so
 easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that
2030 is set before us that is let us put aside material self
 and sense and seek the divine Principle and Science of
 all healing

 Moral victory

211 If Truth is overcoming error in your daily walk and
 conversation you can finally say I have fought a
213 good fight    I have kept the faith be
 cause you are a better man This is having
 our part in the atonement with Truth and Love
216 Christians do not continue to labor and pray expecting
 because of anothers goodness suffering and triumph
 that they shall reach his harmony and reward

219 If the disciple is advancing spiritually he is striv
 ing to enter in He constantly turns away from ma
 terial sense and looks towards the imperishable things
2112 of Spirit If honest he will be in earnest from the
 start and gain a little each day in the right direction
 till at last he finishes his course with joy

 Inharmonious travellers

2115 If my friends are going to Europe while I am en
 route for California we are not journeying together
 We have separate timetables to consult
2118 different routes to pursue Our paths have
 diverged at the very outset and we have little oppor
 tunity to help each other On the contrary if my
2121 friends pursue my course we have the same railroad
 guides and our mutual interests are identical or if I
 take up their line of travel they help me on and our
2124 companionship may continue

 Zigzag course

 Being in sympathy with matter the worldly man is at
 the beck and call of error and will be attracted thither
2127 ward He is like a traveller going westward
 for a pleasuretrip The company is alluring
 and the pleasures exciting After following the sun for
2130 six days he turns east on the seventh satisfied if he can
 only imagine himself drifting in the right direction By
 andby ashamed of his zigzag course he would borrow
221 the passport of some wiser pilgrim thinking with the aid
 of this to find and follow the right road

 Moral retrogression

223 Vibrating like a pendulum between sin and the hope
 of forgiveness selfishness and sensuality causing con
 stant retrogression our moral progress will
226 be slow Waking to Christs demand mortals
 experience suffering This causes them even as drown
 ing men to make vigorous efforts to save themselves and
229 through Christs precious love these efforts are crowned
 with success

 Wait for reward

 Work out your own salvation is the demand of
2212 Life and Love for to this end God worketh with you
 Occupy till I come Wait for your re
 ward and be not weary in well doing If
2215 your endeavors are beset by fearful odds and you receive
 no present reward go not back to error nor become a
 sluggard in the race

2218 When the smoke of battle clears away you will dis
 cern the good you have done and receive according to
 your deserving Love is not hasty to deliver us from
2221 temptation for Love means that we shall be tried and
 purified

 Deliverance not vicarious

 Final deliverance from error whereby we rejoice in
2224 immortality boundless freedom and sinless sense is not
 reached through paths of flowers nor by pinning
 ones faith without works to anothers vicarious
2227 effort Whosoever believeth that wrath is righteous or
 that divinity is appeased by human suffering does not
 understand God

 Justice and substitution

2230 Justice requires reformation of the sinner Mercy
 cancels the debt only when justice approves Revenge
 is inadmissible Wrath which is only appeased is not
231 destroyed but partially indulged Wisdom and Love
 may require many sacrifices of self to save us from sin
233 One sacrifice however great is insufficient to
 pay the debt of sin The atonement requires
 constant selfimmolation on the sinners part That
236 Gods wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son is
 divinely unnatural Such a theory is manmade The
 atonement is a hard problem in theology but its scien
239 tific explanation is that suffering is an error of sinful sense
 which Truth destroys and that eventually both sin and suf
 fering will fall at the feet of everlasting Love

 Doctrines and faith

2312 Rabbinical lore said He that taketh one doctrine
 firm in faith has the Holy Ghost dwelling in him
 This preaching receives a strong rebuke in
2315 the Scripture Faith without works is dead
 Faith if it be mere belief is as a pendulum swinging be
 tween nothing and something having no fixity Faith
2318 advanced to spiritual understanding is the evidence gained
 from Spirit which rebukes sin of every kind and estab
 lishes the claims of God

 Selfreliance and confidence

2321 In Hebrew Greek Latin and English faith and the
 words corresponding thereto have these two defini
 tions trustfulness and trustworthiness One
2324 kind of faith trusts ones welfare to others
 Another kind of faith understands divine Love and how
 to work out ones own salvation with fear and trem
2327 bling Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief
 expresses the helplessness of a blind faith whereas the
 injunction Believe    and thou shalt be saved
2330 demands selfreliant trustworthiness which includes spir
 itual understanding and confides all to God

 The Hebrew verb to believe means also to be firm or
241 to be constant This certainly applies to Truth and Love
 understood and practised Firmness in error will never
243 save from sin disease and death

 Lifes healing currents

 Acquaintance with the original texts and willingness
 to give up human beliefs established by hierarchies and
246 instigated sometimes by the worst passions of
 men open the way for Christian Science to be
 understood and make the Bible the chart of life where
249 the buoys and healing currents of Truth are pointed
 out

 Radical changes

 He to whom the arm of the Lord is revealed will
2412 believe our report and rise into newness of life with re
 generation This is having part in the atone
 ment this is the understanding in which
2415 Jesus suffered and triumphed The time is not distant
 when the ordinary theological views of atonement will
 undergo a great change  a change as radical as that
2418 which has come over popular opinions in regard to pre
 destination and future punishment

 Purpose of crucifixion

 Does erudite theology regard the crucifixion of Jesus
2421 chiefly as providing a ready pardon for all sinners who
 ask for it and are willing to be forgiven
 Does spiritualism find Jesus death necessary
2424 only for the presentation after death of the material
 Jesus as a proof that spirits can return to earth Then
 we must differ from them both

2427 The efficacy of the crucifixion lay in the practical af
 fection and goodness it demonstrated for mankind The
 truth had been lived among men but until they saw that
2430 it enabled their Master to triumph over the grave his own
 disciples could not admit such an event to be possible
 After the resurrection even the unbelieving Thomas was
251 forced to acknowledge how complete was the great proof of
 Truth and Love

 True flesh and blood

253 The spiritual essence of blood is sacrifice The effi
 cacy of Jesus spiritual offering is infinitely greater than
 can be expressed by our sense of human
256 blood The material blood of Jesus was no
 more efficacious to cleanse from sin when it was shed
 upon the accursed tree than when it was flowing in
259 his veins as he went daily about his Fathers business
 His true flesh and blood were his Life and they truly eat
 his flesh and drink his blood who partake of that divine
2512 Life

 Effective triumph

 Jesus taught the way of Life by demonstration that
 we may understand how this divine Principle heals
2515 the sick casts out error and triumphs over
 death Jesus presented the ideal of God better
 than could any man whose origin was less spiritual By
2518 his obedience to God he demonstrated more spiritu
 ally than all others the Principle of being Hence the
 force of his admonition If ye love me keep my com
2521 mandments

 Though demonstrating his control over sin and disease
 the great Teacher by no means relieved others from giving
2524 the requisite proofs of their own piety He worked for
 their guidance that they might demonstrate this power as
 he did and understand its divine Principle Implicit faith
2527 in the Teacher and all the emotional love we can bestow
 on him will never alone make us imitators of him We
 must go and do likewise else we are not improving the
2530 great blessings which our Master worked and suffered to
 bestow upon us The divinity of the Christ was made
 manifest in the humanity of Jesus

 Individual experience

261 While we adore Jesus and the heart overflows with
 gratitude for what he did for mortals  treading alone
263 his loving pathway up to the throne of
 glory in speechless agony exploring the way
 for us  yet Jesus spares us not one individual expe
266 rience if we follow his commands faithfully and all
 have the cup of sorrowful effort to drink in proportion
 to their demonstration of his love till all are redeemed
269 through divine Love

 Christs demonstration

 The Christ was the Spirit which Jesus implied in his
 own statements I am the way the truth and the life
2612 I and my Father are one This Christ
 or divinity of the man Jesus was his divine
 nature the godliness which animated him Divine Truth
2615 Life and Love gave Jesus authority over sin sickness
 and death His mission was to reveal the Science of
 celestial being to prove what God is and what He does
2618 for man

 Proof in practice

 A musician demonstrates the beauty of the music he
 teaches in order to show the learner the way by prac
2621 tice as well as precept Jesus teaching and
 practice of Truth involved such a sacrifice
 as makes us admit its Principle to be Love This was
2624 the precious import of our Masters sinless career and
 of his demonstration of power over death He proved
 by his deeds that Christian Science destroys sickness sin
2627 and death

 Our Master taught no mere theory doctrine or belief
 It was the divine Principle of all real being which he
2630 taught and practised His proof of Christianity was no
 form or system of religion and worship but Christian
 Science working out the harmony of Life and Love
271 Jesus sent a message to John the Baptist which was in
 tended to prove beyond a question that the Christ had
273 come Go your way and tell John what things ye have
 seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk
 the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised
276 to the poor the gospel is preached In other words
 Tell John what the demonstration of divine power is
 and he will at once perceive that God is the power in
279 the Messianic work

 Living temple

 That Life is God Jesus proved by his reappearance
 after the crucifixion in strict accordance with his scien
2712 tific statement Destroy this temple body
 and in three days I Spirit will raise it up
 It is as if he had said The I  the Life substance
2715 and intelligence of the universe  is not in matter to
 be destroyed

 Jesus parables explain Life as never mingling with
2718 sin and death He laid the axe of Science at the root
 of material knowledge that it might be ready to cut
 down the false doctrine of pantheism  that God or
2721 Life is in or of matter

 Recreant disciples

 Jesus sent forth seventy students at one time but only
 eleven left a desirable historic record Tradition credits
2724 him with two or three hundred other disciples
 who have left no name Many are called
 but few are chosen They fell away from grace because
2727 they never truly understood their Masters instruction

 Why do those who profess to follow Christ reject the
 essential religion he came to establish Jesus persecu
2730 tors made their strongest attack upon this very point
 They endeavored to hold him at the mercy of matter and
 to kill him according to certain assumed material laws

 Help and hindrance

281 The Pharisees claimed to know and to teach the di
 vine will but they only hindered the success of Jesus
283 mission Even many of his students stood
 in his way If the Master had not taken a
 student and taught the unseen verities of God he would
286 not have been crucified The determination to hold Spirit
 in the grasp of matter is the persecutor of Truth and
 Love

289 While respecting all that is good in the Church or out
 of it ones consecration to Christ is more on the ground
 of demonstration than of profession In conscience we
2812 cannot hold to beliefs outgrown and by understanding
 more of the divine Principle of the deathless Christ we
 are enabled to heal the sick and to triumph over sin

 Misleading conceptions

2815 Neither the origin the character nor the work of
 Jesus was generally understood Not a single compo
 nent part of his nature did the material
2818 world measure aright Even his righteous
 less and purity did not hinder men from saying He
 is a glutton and a friend of the impure and Beelzebub is
2821 his patron

 Persecution prolonged

 Remember thou Christian martyr it is enough if
 thou art found worthy to unloose the sandals of thy
2824 Masters feet To suppose that persecution
 for righteousness sake belongs to the past
 and that Christianity today is at peace with the world
2827 because it is honored by sects and societies is to mis
 take the very nature of religion Error repeats itself
 The trials encountered by prophet disciple and apostle
2830 of whom the world was not worthy await in some
 form every pioneer of truth

 Christian warfare

 There is too much animal courage in society and not
291 sufficient moral courage Christians must take up arms
 against error at home and abroad They must grapple
293 with sin in themselves and in others and
 continue this warfare until they have finished
 their course If they keep the faith they will have the
296 crown of rejoicing

 Christian experience teaches faith in the right and dis
 belief in the wrong It bids us work the more earnestly
299 in times of persecution because then our labor is more
 needed Great is the reward of selfsacrifice though we
 may never receive it in this world

 The Fatherhood of God

2912 There is a tradition that Publius Lentulus wrote to
 the authorities at Rome The disciples of Jesus be
 lieve him the Son of God Those instructed
2915 in Christian Science have reached the glori
 ous perception that God is the only author of man
 The Virginmother conceived this idea of God and
2918 gave to her ideal the name of Jesus  that is Joshua
 or Saviour

 Spiritual conception

 The illumination of Marys spiritual sense put to
2921 silence material law and its order of generation and
 brought forth her child by the revelation of
 Truth demonstrating God as the Father of
2924 men The Holy Ghost or divine Spirit overshadowed
 the pure sense of the Virginmother with the full recog
 nition that being is Spirit The Christ dwelt forever
2927 an idea in the bosom of God the divine Principle of the
 man Jesus and woman perceived this spiritual idea
 though at first faintly developed

2930 Man as the offspring of God as the idea of Spirit
 is the immortal evidence that Spirit is harmonious and
 man eternal Jesus was the offspring of Marys self
301 conscious communion with God Hence he could give
 a more spiritual idea of life than other men and could
303 demonstrate the Science of Love  his Father or divine
 Principle

 Jesus the wayshower

 Born of a woman Jesus advent in the flesh partook
306 partly of Marys earthly condition although he was en
 dowed with the Christ the divine Spirit with
 out measure This accounts for his struggles
309 in Gethsemane and on Calvary and this enabled him to
 be the mediator or wayshower between God and men
 Had his origin and birth been wholly apart from mortal
3012 usage Jesus would not have been appreciable to mortal
 mind as the way

 Rabbi and priest taught the Mosaic law which said
3015 An eye for an eye and Whoso sheddeth mans blood
 by man shall his blood be shed Not so did Jesus the
 new executor for God present the divine law of Love
3018 which blesses even those that curse it

 Rebukes helpful

 As the individual ideal of Truth Christ Jesus came to
 rebuke rabbinical error and all sin sickness and death
3021 to point out the way of Truth and Life This
 ideal was demonstrated throughout the whole
 earthly career of Jesus showing the difference between
3024 the offspring of Soul and of material sense of Truth and
 of error

 If we have triumphed sufficiently over the errors of
3027 material sense to allow Soul to hold the control we
 shall loathe sin and rebuke it under every mask Only
 in this way can we bless our enemies though they
3030 may not so construe our words We cannot choose for
 ourselves but must work out our salvation in the way
 Jesus taught In meekness and might he was found
311 preaching the gospel to the poor Pride and fear are unfit
 to bear the standard of Truth and God will never place
313 it in such hands

 Fleshly ties temporal

 Jesus acknowledged no ties of the flesh He said Call
 no man your father upon the earth for one is your Father
316 which is in heaven Again he asked Who
 is my mother and who are my brethren im
 plying that it is they who do the will of his Father We
319 have no record of his calling any man by the name of
 father He recognized Spirit God as the only creator and
 therefore as the Father of all

 Healing primary

3112 First in the list of Christian duties he taught his fol
 lowers the healing power of Truth and Love He attached
 no importance to dead ceremonies It is the
3115 living Christ the practical Truth which makes
 Jesus the resurrection and the life to all who follow him
 in deed Obeying his precious precepts  following his
3118 demonstration so far as we apprehend it  we drink of
 his cup partake of his bread are baptized with his pu
 rity and at last we shall rest sit down with him in a full
3121 understanding of the divine Principle which triumphs
 over death For what says Paul As often as ye eat
 this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lords
3124 death till he come

 Painful prospect

 Referring to the materiality of the age Jesus said
 The hour cometh and now is when the true wor
3127 shippers shall worship the Father in spirit
 and in truth Again foreseeing the perse
 cution which would attend the Science of Spirit Jesus
3130 said They shall put you out of the synagogues yea
 the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think
 that he doeth God service and these things will they
321 do unto you because they have not known the Father
 nor me

 Sacred sacrament

323 In ancient Rome a soldier was required to swear
 allegiance to his general The Latin word for this oath
 was sacramentum and our English word
326 sacrament is derived from it Among the
 Jews it was an ancient custom for the master of a
 feast to pass each guest a cup of wine But the
329 Eucharist does not commemorate a Roman soldiers
 oath nor was the wine used on convivial occasions and
 in Jewish rites the cup of our Lord The cup shows
3212 forth his bitter experience  the cup which he prayed
 might pass from him though he bowed in holy submis
 sion to the divine decree

3215 As they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed
 it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said
 Take eat this is my body And he took the cup and
3218 gave thanks and gave it to them saying Drink ye all
 of it

 Spiritual refreshment

 The true sense is spiritually lost if the sacrament is
3221 confined to the use of bread and wine The disciples
 had eaten yet Jesus prayed and gave them
 bread This would have been foolish in a
3224 literal sense but in its spiritual signification it was nat
 ural and beautiful Jesus prayed he withdrew from the
 material senses to refresh his heart with brighter with
3227 spiritual views

 Jesus sad repast

 The Passover which Jesus ate with his disciples in
 the month Nisan on the night before his crucifixion
3230 was a mournful occasion a sad supper taken
 at the close of day in the twilight of a
 glorious career with shadows fast falling around and
331 this supper closed forever Jesus ritualism or concessions
 to matter

 Heavenly supplies

333 His followers sorrowful and silent anticipating the hour
 of their Masters betrayal partook of the heavenly manna
 which of old had fed in the wilderness the
336 persecuted followers of Truth Their bread
 indeed came down from heaven It was the great truth
 of spiritual being healing the sick and casting out error
339 Their Master had explained it all before and now this
 bread was feeding and sustaining them They had borne
 this bread from house to house breaking explaining it to
3312 others and now it comforted themselves

 For this truth of spiritual being their Master was about
 to suffer violence and drain to the dregs his cup of sorrow
3315 He must leave them With the great glory of an everlast
 ing victory overshadowing him he gave thanks and said
 Drink ye all of it

 The holy struggle

3318 When the human element in him struggled with the
 divine our great Teacher said Not my will but
 Thine be done that is Let not the flesh
3321 but the Spirit be represented in me This
 is the new understanding of spiritual Love It gives all
 for Christ or Truth It blesses its enemies heals the
3324 sick casts out error raises the dead from trespasses
 and sins and preaches the gospel to the poor the meek
 in heart

 Incisive questions

3327 Christians are you drinking his cup Have you
 shared the blood of the New Covenant the persecutions
 which attend a new and higher understand
3330 ing of God If not can you then say that
 you have commemorated Jesus in his cup Are all
 who eat bread and drink wine in memory of Jesus willing
341 truly to drink his cup take his cross and leave all for
 the Christprinciple Then why ascribe this inspira
343 tion to a dead rite instead of showing by casting out
 error and making the body holy acceptable unto God
 that Truth has come to the understanding If Christ
346 Truth has come to us in demonstration no other com
 memoration is requisite for demonstration is Immanuel
 or God with us and if a friend be with us why need we
349 memorials of that friend

 Millennial glory

 If all who ever partook of the sacrament had really
 commemorated the sufferings of Jesus and drunk of
3412 his cup they would have revolutionized the
 world If all who seek his commemoration
 through material symbols will take up the cross heal
3415 the sick cast out evils and preach Christ or Truth
 to the poor  the receptive thought  they will bring
 in the millennium

 Fellowship with Christ

3418 Through all the disciples experienced they became more
 spiritual and understood better what the Master had
 taught His resurrection was also their resur
3421 rection It helped them to raise themselves and
 others from spiritual dulness and blind belief in God into
 the perception of infinite possibilities They needed this
3424 quickening for soon their dear Master would rise again
 in the spiritual realm of reality and ascend far above
 their apprehension As the reward for his faithfulness
3427 he would disappear to material sense in that change which
 has since been called the ascension

 The last breakfast

 What a contrast between our Lords last supper and
3430 his last spiritual breakfast with his disciples
 in the bright morning hours at the joyful
 meeting on the shore of the Galilean Sea His gloom
351 had passed into glory and His disciples grief into repent
 ance  hearts chastened and pride rebuked Convinced
353 of the fruitlessness of their toil in the dark and wakened
 by their Masters voice they changed their methods turned
 away from material things and cast their net on the right
356 side Discerning Christ Truth anew on the shore of
 time they were enabled to rise somewhat from mortal
 sensuousness or the burial of mind in matter into new
359 ness of life as Spirit

 This spiritual meeting with our Lord in the dawn of a
 new light is the morning meal which Christian Scientists
3512 commemorate They bow before Christ Truth to re
 ceive more of his reappearing and silently to commune
 with the divine Principle Love They celebrate their
3515 Lords victory over death his probation in the flesh
 after death its exemplification of human probation and
 his spiritual and final ascension above matter or the flesh
3518 when he rose out of material sight

 Spiritual Eucharist

 Our baptism is a purification from all error Our
 church is built on the divine Principle Love We can
3521 unite with this church only as we are new
 born of Spirit as we reach the Life which
 is Truth and the Truth which is Life by bringing forth
3524 the fruits of Love  casting out error and healing the
 sick Our Eucharist is spiritual communion with the one
 God Our bread which cometh down from heaven
3527 is Truth Our cup is the cross Our wine the inspira
 tion of Love the draught our Master drank and com
 mended to his followers

 Final purpose

3530 The design of Love is to reform the sinner If the
 sinners punishment here has been insufficient to re
 form him the good mans heaven would be a hell to
361 the sinner They who know not purity and affection by
 experience can never find bliss in the blessed company of
363 Truth and Love simply through translation
 into another sphere Divine Science reveals
 the necessity of sufficient suffering either before or after
366 death to quench the love of sin To remit the penalty
 due for sin would be for Truth to pardon error Escape
 from punishment is not in accordance with Gods govern
369 ment since justice is the handmaid of mercy

 Jesus endured the shame that he might pour his
 dearbought bounty into barren lives What was his
3612 earthly reward He was forsaken by all save John
 the beloved disciple and a few women who bowed in
 silent woe beneath the shadow of his cross The earthly
3615 price of spirituality in a material age and the great moral
 distance between Christianity and sensualism preclude
 Christian Science from finding favor with the worldly
3618 minded

 Righteous retribution

 A selfish and limited mind may be unjust but the un
 limited and divine Mind is the immortal law of justice as
3621 well as of mercy It is quite as impossible for
 sinners to receive their full punishment this
 side of the grave as for this world to bestow on the right
3624 eous their full reward It is useless to suppose that the
 wicked can gloat over their offences to the last moment
 and then be suddenly pardoned and pushed into heaven
3627 or that the hand of Love is satisfied with giving us only
 toil sacrifice crossbearing multiplied trials and mock
 ery of our motives in return for our efforts at well doing

 Vicarious suffering

3630 Religious history repeats itself in the suf
 fering of the just for the unjust Can God
 therefore overlook the law of righteousness which de
371 stroys the belief called sin Does not Science show that
 sin brings suffering as much today as yesterday They
373 who sin must suffer With what measure ye mete it
 shall be measured to you again

 Martyrs inevitable

 History is full of records of suffering The blood of
376 the martyrs is the seed of the Church Mortals try in
 vain to slay Truth with the steel or the stake
 but error falls only before the sword of Spirit
379 Martyrs are the human links which connect one stage with
 another in the history of religion They are earths lumi
 naries which serve to cleanse and rarefy the atmosphere of
3712 material sense and to permeate humanity with purer ideals
 Consciousness of rightdoing brings its own reward but
 not amid the smoke of battle is merit seen and appreciated
3715 by lookerson

 Complete emulation

 When will Jesus professed followers learn to emulate
 him in all his ways and to imitate his mighty works
3718 Those who procured the martyrdom of that
 righteous man would gladly have turned his
 sacred career into a mutilated doctrinal platform May
3721 the Christians of today take up the more practical im
 port of that career It is possible  yea it is the duty
 and privilege of every child man and woman  to follow
3724 in some degree the example of the Master by the demon
 stration of Truth and Life of health and holiness Chris
 tians claim to be his followers but do they follow him in
3727 the way that he commanded Hear these imperative com
 mands Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father
 which is in heaven is perfect Go ye into all the world
3730 and preach the gospel to every creature Heal the
 sick

 Jesus teaching belittled

 Why has this Christian demand so little inspiration
381 to stir mankind to Christian effort Because men are
 assured that this command was intended only for a par
383 ticular period and for a select number of fol
 lowers This teaching is even more pernicious
 than the old doctrine of foreordination  the election of a
386 few to be saved while the rest are damned and so it will
 be considered when the lethargy of mortals produced
 by manmade doctrines is broken by the demands of
389 divine Science

 Jesus said These signs shall follow them that be
 lieve    they shall lay hands on the sick and they
3812 shall recover Who believes him He was addressing
 his disciples yet he did not say  These signs shall follow
 you but them them that believe in all time to come
3815 Here the word hands is used metaphorically as in the text
 The right hand of the Lord is exalted It expresses
 spiritual power otherwise the healing could not have
3818 been done spiritually At another time Jesus prayed not
 for the twelve only but for as many as should believe
 through their word

 Material pleasures

3821 Jesus experienced few of the pleasures of the physical
 senses but his sufferings were the fruits of other peo
 ples sins not of his own The eternal Christ
3824 his spiritual selfhood never suffered Jesus
 mapped out the path for others He unveiled the Christ
 the spiritual idea of divine Love To those buried in the
3827 belief of sin and self living only for pleasure or the grati
 fication of the senses he said in substance Having eyes
 ye see not and having ears ye hear not lest ye should un
3830 derstand and be converted and I might heal you He
 taught that the material senses shut out Truth and its
 healing power

 Mockery of truth

391 Meekly our Master met the mockery of his unrecog
 nized grandeur Such indignities as he received his fol
393 lowers will endure until Christianitys last
 triumph He won eternal honors He over
 came the world the flesh and all error thus proving
396 their nothingness He wrought a full salvation from sin
 sickness and death We need Christ and him cruci
 fied We must have trials and selfdenials as well as
399 joys and victories until all error is destroyed

 A belief suicidal

 The educated belief that Soul is in the body causes
 mortals to regard death as a friend as a steppingstone
3912 out of mortality into immortality and bliss
 The Bible calls death an enemy and Jesus
 overcame death and the grave instead of yielding to them
3915 He was the way To him therefore death was not
 the threshold over which he must pass into living
 glory

 Present salvation

3918 Now cried the apostle is the accepted time be
 hold now is the day of salvation  meaning not that
 now men must prepare for a futureworld salva
3921 tion or safety but that now is the time in which
 to experience that salvation in spirit and in life Now is
 the time for socalled material pains and material pleas
3924 ures to pass away for both are unreal because impossible
 in Science To break this earthly spell mortals must get
 the true idea and divine Principle of all that really exists
3927 and governs the universe harmoniously This thought is
 apprehended slowly and the interval before its attain
 ment is attended with doubts and defeats as well as
3930 triumphs

 Sin and penalty

 Who will stop the practice of sin so long as he believes
 in the pleasures of sin When mortals once admit that
401 evil confers no pleasure they turn from it Remove error
 from thought and it will not appear in effect The ad
403 vanced thinker and devout Christian perceiv
 ing the scope and tendency of Christian healing
 and its Science will support them Another will say
406 Go thy way for this time when I have a convenient
 season I will call for thee

 Divine Science adjusts the balance as Jesus adjusted
409 it Science removes the penalty only by first removing
 the sin which incurs the penalty This is my sense of
 divine pardon which I understand to mean Gods method
4012 of destroying sin If the saying is true While theres
 life theres hope its opposite is also true While theres
 sin theres doom Anothers suffering cannot lessen our
4015 own liability Did the martyrdom of Savonarola make
 the crimes of his implacable enemies less criminal

 Suffering inevitable

 Was it just for Jesus to suffer No but it was
4018 inevitable for not otherwise could he show us the way
 and the power of Truth If a career so great
 and good as that of Jesus could not avert a
4021 felons fate lesser apostles of Truth may endure human
 brutality without murmuring rejoicing to enter into
 fellowship with him through the triumphal arch of
4024 Truth and Love

 Service and worship

 Our heavenly Father divine Love demands that all
 men should follow the example of our Master and his
4027 apostles and not merely worship his personal
 ity It is sad that the phrase divine service
 has come so generally to mean public worship instead of
4030 daily deeds

 Within the veil

 The nature of Christianity is peaceful and blessed
 but in order to enter into the kingdom the anchor of
411 hope must be cast beyond the veil of matter into the
 Shekinah into which Jesus has passed before us and
413 this advance beyond matter must come
 through the joys and triumphs of the right
 eous as well as through their sorrows and afflictions
416 Like our Master we must depart from material sense
 into the spiritual sense of being

 The thorns and flowers

 The Godinspired walk calmly on though it be with
419 bleeding footprints and in the hereafter they will reap
 what they now sow The pampered hypo
 crite may have a flowery pathway here but
4112 he cannot forever break the Golden Rule and escape the
 penalty due

 Healing early lost

 The proofs of Truth Life and Love which Jesus gave
4115 by casting out error and healing the sick completed his
 earthly mission but in the Christian Church
 this demonstration of healing was early lost
4118 about three centuries after the crucifixion No ancient
 school of philosophy materia medica or scholastic theol
 ogy ever taught or demonstrated the divine healing of
4121 absolute Science

 Immortal achieval

 Jesus foresaw the reception Christian Science would have
 before it was understood but this foreknowledge hindered
4124 him not He fulfilled his Godmission and
 then sat down at the right hand of the Father
 Persecuted from city to city his apostles still went about
4127 doing good deeds for which they were maligned and
 stoned The truth taught by Jesus the elders scoffed at
 Why Because it demanded more than they were willing
4130 to practise It was enough for them to believe in a national
 Deity but that belief from their time to ours has never
 made a disciple who could cast out evils and heal the sick
421 Jesus life proved divinely and scientifically that God
 is Love whereas priest and rabbi affirmed God to be a
423 mighty potentate who loves and hates The Jewish the
 ology gave no hint of the unchanging love of God

 A belief in death

 The universal belief in death is of no advantage It
426 cannot make Life or Truth apparent Death
 will be found at length to be a mortal dream
 which comes in darkness and disappears with the light

 Cruel desertion

429 The man of sorrows was in no peril from salary or
 popularity Though entitled to the homage of the world
 and endorsed preeminently by the approval
4212 of God his brief triumphal entry into Jerusa
 lem was followed by the desertion of all save a few friends
 who sadly followed him to the foot of the cross

 Death outdone

4215 The resurrection of the great demonstrator of Gods
 power was the proof of his final triumph over body
 and matter and gave full evidence of divine
4218 Science  evidence so important to mortals
 The belief that man has existence or mind separate from
 God is a dying error This error Jesus met with divine
4221 Science and proved its nothingness Because of the won
 drous glory which God bestowed on His anointed temp
 tation sin sickness and death had no terror for Jesus
4224 Let men think they had killed the body Afterwards he
 would show it to them unchanged This demonstrates
 that in Christian Science the true man is governed by
4227 God  by good not evil  and is therefore not a mortal
 but an immortal Jesus had taught his disciples the
 Science of this proof He was here to enable them to
4230 test his still uncomprehended saying He that believ
 eth on me the works that I do shall he do also They
 must understand more fully his Lifeprinciple by casting
431 out error healing the sick and raising the dead even as
 they did understand it after his bodily departure

 Pentecost repeated

433 The magnitude of Jesus work his material disappear
 ance before their eyes and his reappearance all enabled
 the disciples to understand what Jesus had
436 said Heretofore they had only believed
 now they understood The advent of this understanding
 is what is meant by the descent of the Holy Ghost  that
439 influx of divine Science which so illuminated the Pentecos
 tal Day and is now repeating its ancient history

 Convincing evidence

 Jesus last proof was the highest the most convincing
4312 the most profitable to his students The malignity of
 brutal persecutors the treason and suicide of
 his betrayer were overruled by divine Love to
4315 the glorification of the man and of the true idea of God
 which Jesus persecutors had mocked and tried to slay
 The final demonstration of the truth which Jesus taught
4318 and for which he was crucified opened a new era for the
 world Those who slew him to stay his influence perpetu
 ated and extended it

 Divine victory

4321 Jesus rose higher in demonstration because of the cup
 of bitterness he drank Human law had condemned
 him but he was demonstrating divine Science
4324 Out of reach of the barbarity of his enemies
 he was acting under spiritual law in defiance of mat
 ter and mortality and that spiritual law sustained him
4327 The divine must overcome the human at every point
 The Science Jesus taught and lived must triumph over
 all material beliefs about life substance and intelli
4330 gence and the multitudinous errors growing from such
 beliefs

 Love must triumph over hate Truth and Life must
441 seal the victory over error and death before the thorns
 can be laid aside for a crown the benediction follow
443 Well done good and faithful servant and the suprem
 acy of Spirit be demonstrated

 Jesus in the tomb

 The lonely precincts of the tomb gave Jesus a refuge
446 from his foes a place in which to solve the great
 problem of being His three days work in
 the sepulchre set the seal of eternity on time
449 He proved Life to be deathless and Love to be the mas
 ter of hate He met and mastered on the basis of Chris
 tian Science the power of Mind over matter all the claims
4412 of medicine surgery and hygiene

 He took no drugs to allay inflammation He did not
 depend upon food or pure air to resuscitate wasted
4415 energies He did not require the skill of a surgeon to
 heal the torn palms and bind up the wounded side and
 lacerated feet that he might use those hands to remove
4418 the napkin and windingsheet and that he might employ
 his feet as before

 The deific naturalism

 Could it be called supernatural for the God of nature
4421 to sustain Jesus in his proof of mans truly derived power
 It was a method of surgery beyond material
 art but it was not a supernatural act On
4424 the contrary it was a divinely natural act whereby divinity
 brought to humanity the understanding of the Christ
 healing and revealed a method infinitely above that of
4427 human invention

 Obstacles overcome

 His disciples believed Jesus to be dead while he was
 hidden in the sepulchre whereas he was alive demon
4430 strating within the narrow tomb the power
 of Spirit to overrule mortal material sense
 There were rockribbed walls in the way and a great
451 stone must be rolled from the caves mouth but Jesus
 vanquished every material obstacle overcame every law
453 of matter and stepped forth from his gloomy restingplace
 crowned with the glory of a sublime success an everlasting
 victory

 Victory over the grave

456 Our Master fully and finally demonstrated divine Sci
 ence in his victory over death and the grave Jesus
 deed was for the enlightenment of men and
459 for the salvation of the whole world from sin
 sickness and death Paul writes For if when we were
 enemies we were reconciled to God by the seeming death
4512 of His Son much more being reconciled we shall be saved
 by his life Three days after his bodily burial he talked
 with his disciples The persecutors had failed to hide im
4515 mortal Truth and Love in a sepulchre

 The stone rolled away

 Glory be to God and peace to the struggling hearts
 Christ hath rolled away the stone from the door of hu
4518 man hope and faith and through the reve
 lation and demonstration of life in God hath
 elevated them to possible atonement with the spiritual
4521 idea of man and his divine Principle Love

 After the resurrection

 They who earliest saw Jesus after the resurrection
 and beheld the final proof of all that he had taught
4524 misconstrued that event Even his disciples
 at first called him a spirit ghost or spectre
 for they believed his body to be dead His reply was
4527 Spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have
 The reappearing of Jesus was not the return of a spirit
 He presented the same body that he had before his cru
4530 cifixion and so glorified the supremacy of Mind over
 matter

 Jesus students not sufficiently advanced fully to un
461 derstand their Masters triumph did not perform many
 wonderful works until they saw him after his crucifixion
463 and learned that he had not died This convinced them
 of the truthfulness of all that he had taught

 Spiritual interpretation

 In the walk to Emmaus Jesus was known to his friends
466 by the words which made their hearts burn within them
 and by the breaking of bread The divine
 Spirit which identified Jesus thus centuries
469 ago has spoken through the inspired Word and will speak
 through it in every age and clime It is revealed to the
 receptive heart and is again seen casting out evil and
4612 healing the sick

 Corporeality and Spirit

 The Master said plainly that physique was not Spirit
 and after his resurrection he proved to the physical senses
4615 that his body was not changed until he himself
 ascended  or in other words rose even
 higher in the understanding of Spirit God To convince
4618 Thomas of this Jesus caused him to examine the nail
 prints and the spearwound

 Spiritual ascension

 Jesus unchanged physical condition after what seemed
4621 to be death was followed by his exaltation above all ma
 terial conditions and this exaltation explained
 his ascension and revealed unmistakably a
4624 probationary and progressive state beyond the grave
 Jesus was the way that is he marked the way for
 all men In his final demonstration called the ascen
4627 sion which closed the earthly record of Jesus he rose
 above the physical knowledge of his disciples and the
 material senses saw him no more

 Pentecostal power

4630 His students then received the Holy Ghost By this is
 meant that by all they had witnessed and suffered they
 were roused to an enlarged understanding of divine Sci
471 ence even to the spiritual interpretation and discernment
 of Jesus teachings and demonstrations which gave them
473 a faint conception of the Life which is God
 They no longer measured man by material
 sense After gaining the true idea of their glorified Master
476 they became better healers leaning no longer on matter
 but on the divine Principle of their work The influx of
 light was sudden It was sometimes an overwhelming
479 power as on the Day of Pentecost

 The traitors conspiracy

 Judas conspired against Jesus The worlds ingratitude
 and hatred towards that just man effected his betrayal
4712 The traitors price was thirty pieces of silver
 and the smiles of the Pharisees He chose his
 time when the people were in doubt concerning Jesus
4715 teachings

 A period was approaching which would reveal the in
 finite distance between Judas and his Master Judas
4718 Iscariot knew this He knew that the great goodness of
 that Master placed a gulf between Jesus and his betrayer
 and this spiritual distance inflamed Judas envy The
4721 greed for gold strengthened his ingratitude and for a time
 quieted his remorse He knew that the world generally
 loves a lie better than Truth and so he plotted the be
4724 trayal of Jesus in order to raise himself in popular esti
 mation His dark plot fell to the ground and the
 traitor fell with it
4727 The disciples desertion of their Master in his last
 earthly struggle was punished each one came to a vio
 lent death except St John of whose death we have no
4730 record

 Gethsemane glorified

 During his night of gloom and glory in the garden
 Jesus realized the utter error of a belief in any possi
481 ble material intelligence The pangs of neglect and the
 staves of bigoted ignorance smote him sorely His stu
483 dents slept He said unto them Could Ye
 not watch with me one hour Could they
 not watch with him who waiting and struggling in voice
486 less agony held uncomplaining guard over a world
 There was no response to that human yearning and so
 Jesus turned forever away from earth to heaven from
489 sense to Soul

 Remembering the sweat of agony which fell in holy
 benediction on the grass of Gethsemane shall the hum
4812 blest or mightiest disciple murmur when he drinks from the
 same cup and think or even wish to escape the exalt
 ing ordeal of sins revenge on its destroyer Truth and
4815 Love bestow few palms until the consummation of a
 lifework

 Defensive weapons

 Judas had the worlds weapons Jesus had not one
4818 of them and chose not the worlds means of defence
 He opened not his mouth The great dem
 onstrator of Truth and Love was silent before
4821 envy and hate Peter would have smitten the enemies of
 his Master but Jesus forbade him thus rebuking re
 sentment or animal courage He said Put up thy
4824 sword

 Pilates question

 Pale in the presence of his own momentous question
 What is Truth Pilate was drawn into acquiescence
4827 with the demands of Jesus enemies Pilate
 was ignorant of the consequences of his awful
 decision against human rights and divine Love knowing
4830 not that he was hastening the final demonstration of what
 life is and of what the true knowledge of God can do for
 man

491 The women at the cross could have answered Pilates
 question They knew what had inspired their devotion
493 winged their faith opened the eyes of their understand
 ing healed the sick cast out evil and caused the disciples
 to say to their Master Even the devils are subject
496 unto us through thy name

 Students ingratitude

 Where were the seventy whom Jesus sent forth Were
 all conspirators save eleven Had they forgotten the
499 great exponent of God Had they so soon lost
 sight of his mighty works his toils privations
 sacrifices his divine patience sublime courage and unre
4912 quited affection O why did they not gratify his last
 human yearning with one sign of fidelity

 Heavens sentinel

 The meek demonstrator of good the highest instruc
4915 tor and friend of man met his earthly fate alone with
 God No human eye was there to pity no
 arm to save Forsaken by all whom he had
4918 blessed this faithful sentinel of God at the highest
 post of power charged with the grandest trust of
 heaven was ready to be transformed by the renewing
4921 of the infinite Spirit He was to prove that the Christ
 is not subject to material conditions but is above the
 reach of human wrath and is able through Truth
4924 Life and Love to triumph over sin sickness death and
 the grave

 Cruel contumely

 The priests and rabbis before whom he had meekly
4927 walked and those to whom he had given the highest
 proofs of divine power mocked him on the
 cross saying derisively He saved others
4930 himself he cannot save These scoffers who turned
 aside the right of a man before the face of the Most
 High esteemed Jesus as stricken smitten of God
501 He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
 before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth
503 Who shall declare his generation Who shall decide
 what truth and love are

 A cry of despair

 The last supreme moment of mockery desertion tor
506 ture added to an overwhelming sense of the magnitude
 of his work wrung from Jesus lips the awful
 cry My God why hast Thou forsaken me
509 This despairing appeal if made to a human parent would
 impugn the justice and love of a father who could with
 hold a clear token of his presence to sustain and bless so
5012 faithful a son The appeal of Jesus was made both to
 his divine Principle the God who is Love and to himself
 Loves pure idea Had Life Truth and Love forsaken
5015 him in his highest demonstration This was a startling
 question No They must abide in him and he in them
 or that hour would be shorn of its mighty blessing for the
5018 human race

 Divine Science misunderstood

 If his full recognition of eternal Life had for a mo
 ment given way before the evidence of the bodily senses
5021 what would his accusers have said Even
 what they did say  that Jesus teachings
 were false and that all evidence of their cor
5024 rectness was destroyed by his death But this saying
 could not make it so

 The real pillory

 The burden of that hour was terrible beyond human
5027 conception The distrust of mortal minds disbelieving
 the purpose of his mission was a million
 times sharper than the thorns which pierced
5030 his flesh The real cross which Jesus bore up the hill
 of grief was the worlds hatred of Truth and Love Not
 the spear nor the material cross wrung from his faithful
511 lips the plaintive cry Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani It
 was the possible loss of something more important than
513 human life which moved him  the possible misappre
 hension of the sublimest influence of his career This
 dread added the drop of gall to his cup

 Lifepower indestructible

516 Jesus could have withdrawn himself from his enemies
 He had power to lay down a human sense of life for his
 spiritual identity in the likeness of the divine
519 but he allowed men to attempt the destruc
 tion of the mortal body in order that he might furnish
 the proof of immortal life Nothing could kill this Life
5112 of man Jesus could give his temporal life into his
 enemies hands but when his earthmission was accom
 plished his spiritual life indestructible and eternal
5115 was found forever the same He knew that matter had
 no life and that real Life is God therefore he could no
 more be separated from his spiritual Life than God could
5118 be extinguished

 Example for our salvation

 His consummate example was for the salvation of us
 all but only through doing the works which he did and
5121 taught others to do His purpose in healing
 was not alone to restore health but to demon
 strate his divine Principle He was inspired by God by
5124 Truth and Love in all that he said and did The motives
 of his persecutors were pride envy cruelty and vengeance
 inflicted on the physical Jesus but aimed at the divine Prin
5127 ciple Love which rebuked their sensuality

 Jesus was unselfish His spirituality separated him
 from sensuousness and caused the selfish materialist
5130 to hate him but it was this spirituality which enabled
 Jesus to heal the sick cast out evil and raise the
 dead

 Masters business

521 From early boyhood he was about his Fathers busi
 ness His pursuits lay far apart from theirs His mas
523 ter was Spirit their master was matter He
 served God they served mammon His affec
 tions were pure theirs were carnal His senses drank in
526 the spiritual evidence of health holiness and life their
 senses testified oppositely and absorbed the material evi
 dence of sin sickness and death

 Puritys rebuke

529 Their imperfections and impurity felt the everpresent
 rebuke of his perfection and purity Hence the worlds
 hatred of the just and perfect Jesus and the
5212 prophets foresight of the reception error would
 give him Despised and rejected of men was Isaiahs
 graphic word concerning the coming Prince of Peace
5215 Herod and Pilate laid aside old feuds in order to unite
 in putting to shame and death the best man that ever
 trod the globe Today as of old error and evil again
5218 make common cause against the exponents of truth

 Saviours prediction

 The man of sorrows best understood the nothing
 ness of material life and intelligence and the mighty ac
5221 tuality of allinclusive God good These were
 the two cardinal points of Mindhealing or
 Christian Science which armed him with Love The high
5224 est earthly representative of God speaking of human
 ability to reflect divine power prophetically said to his
 disciples speaking not for their day only but for all time
5227 He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do
 also and These signs shall follow them that believe

 Defamatory accusations

 The accusations of the Pharisees were as selfcontra
5230 dictory as their religion The bigot the deb
 auchee the hypocrite called Jesus a glutton
 and a winebibber They said He casteth out devils
531 through Beelzebub and is the friend of publicans and
 sinners The latter accusation was true but not in their
533 meaning Jesus was no ascetic He did not fast as did
 the Baptists disciples yet there never lived a man so far
 removed from appetites and passions as the Nazarene
536 He rebuked sinners pointedly and unflinchingly because
 he was their friend hence the cup he drank

 Reputation and character

 The reputation of Jesus was the very opposite of his
539 character Why Because the divine Principle and
 practice of Jesus were misunderstood He
 was at work in divine Science His words
5312 and works were unknown to the world because above
 and contrary to the worlds religious sense Mortals be
 lieved in God as humanly mighty rather than as divine
5315 infinite Love

 Inspiring discontent

 The world could not interpret aright the discomfort
 which Jesus inspired and the spiritual blessings which
5318 might flow from such discomfort Science
 shows the cause of the shock so often pro
 duced by the truth  namely that this shock arises from
5321 the great distance between the individual and Truth
 Like Peter we should weep over the warning instead of
 denying the truth or mocking the lifelong sacrifice which
5324 goodness makes for the destruction of evil

 Bearing our sins

 Jesus bore our sins in his body He knew the
 mortal errors which constitute the material body and
5327 could destroy those errors but at the time
 when Jesus felt our infirmities he had not
 conquered all the beliefs of the flesh or his sense of ma
5330 terial life nor had he risen to his final demonstration of
 spiritual power

 Had he shared the sinful beliefs of others he would
541 have been less sensitive to those beliefs Through the
 magnitude of his human life he demonstrated the divine
543 Life Out of the amplitude of his pure affection he de
 fined Love With the affluence of Truth he vanquished
 error The world acknowledged not his righteousness
546 seeing it not but earth received the harmony his glorified
 example introduced

 Inspiration of sacrifice

 Who is ready to follow his teaching and example All
549 must sooner or later plant themselves in Christ the true
 idea of God That he might liberally pour
 his dearbought treasures into empty or sin
5412 filled human storehouses was the inspiration of Jesus
 intense human sacrifice In witness of his divine com
 mission he presented the proof that Life Truth and
5415 Love heal the sick and the sinning and triumph over
 death through Mind not matter This was the highest
 proof he could have offered of divine Love His hearers
5418 understood neither his words nor his works They
 would not accept his meek interpretation of life nor
 follow his example

 Spiritual friendship

5421 His earthly cup of bitterness was drained to the
 dregs There adhered to him only a few unpretentious
 friends whose religion was something more
5424 than a name It was so vital that it en
 abled them to understand the Nazarene and to share
 the glory of eternal life He said that those who fol
5427 lowed him should drink of his cup and history has con
 firmed the prediction

 Injustice to the Saviour

 If that Godlike and glorified man were physically on
5430 earth today would not some who now pro
 fess to love him reject him Would they
 not deny him even the rights of humanity if he enter
551 tained any other sense of being and religion than theirs
 The advancing century from a deadened sense of the
553 invisible God today subjects to unchristian comment and
 usage the idea of Christian healing enjoined by Jesus but
 this does not affect the invincible facts
556 Perhaps the early Christian era did Jesus no more
 injustice than the later centuries have bestowed upon
 the healing Christ and spiritual idea of being Now
559 that the gospel of healing is again preached by the
 wayside does not the pulpit sometimes scorn it But
 that curative mission which presents the Saviour in a
5512 clearer light than mere words can possibly do cannot be
 left out of Christianity although it is again ruled out of
 the synagogue

5515 Truths immortal idea is sweeping down the centuries
 gathering beneath its wings the sick and sinning My
 weary hope tries to realize that happy day when man shall
5518 recognize the Science of Christ and love his neighbor as
 himself  when he shall realize Gods omnipotence and
 the healing power of the divine Love in what it has done
5521 and is doing for mankind The promises will be ful
 filled The time for the reappearing of the divine healing
 is throughout all time and whosoever layeth his earthly
5524 all on the altar of divine Science drinketh of Christs
 cup now and is endued with the spirit and power of
 Christian healing

5527 In the words of St John He shall give you another
 Comforter that he may abide with you forever This
 Comforter I understand to be Divine Science




 CHAPTER III  MARRIAGE

 What therefore God hath joined together let not man put
 asunder In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given
 in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven  JESUS

561 WHEN our great Teacher came to him for baptism
 John was astounded Reading his thoughts Jesus
563 added Suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us
 to fulfil all righteousness Jesus concessions in certain
 cases to material methods were for the advancement of
566 spiritual good

 Marriage temporal

 Marriage is the legal and moral provision for genera
 tion among human kind Until the spiritual creation
569 is discerned intact is apprehended and under
 stood and His kingdom is come as in the vision
 of the Apocalypse  where the corporeal sense of crea
5612 tion was cast out and its spiritual sense was revealed from
 heaven  marriage will continue subject to such moral
 regulations as will secure increasing virtue

 Fidelity required

5615 Infidelity to the marriage covenant is the social scourge
 of all races the pestilence that walketh in darkness
    the destruction that wasteth at noonday
5618 The commandment Thou shalt not com
 mit adultery is no less imperative than the one Thou
 shalt not kill

571 Chastity is the cement of civilization and progress
 Without it there is no stability in society and without it
573 one cannot attain the Science of Life

 Mental elements

 Union of the masculine and feminine qualities consti
 tutes completeness The masculine mind reaches a
576 higher tone through certain elements of the
 feminine while the feminine mind gains cour
 age and strength through masculine qualities These
579 different elements conjoin naturally with each other and
 their true harmony is in spiritual oneness Both sexes
 should be loving pure tender and strong The attrac
5712 tion between native qualities will be perpetual only as it
 is pure and true bringing sweet seasons of renewal like
 the returning spring

 Affections demands

5715 Beauty wealth or fame is incompetent to meet the
 demands of the affections and should never weigh
 against the better claims of intellect good
5718 ness and virtue Happiness is spiritual
 born of Truth and Love It is unselfish therefore
 it cannot exist alone but requires all mankind to
5721 share it

 Help and discipline

 Human affection is not poured forth vainly even
 though it meet no return Love enriches the nature en
5724 larging purifying and elevating it The wintry
 blasts of earth may uproot the flowers of affec
 tion and scatter them to the winds but this severance
5727 of fleshly ties serves to unite thought more closely to
 God for Love supports the struggling heart until it ceases
 to sigh over the world and begins to unfold its wings for
5730 heaven

 Marriage is unblest or blest according to the disap
 pointments it involves or the hopes it fulfils To happify
581 existence by constant intercourse with those adapted to
 elevate it should be the motive of society Unity of
583 spirit gives new pinions to joy or else joys drooping
 wings trail in dust

 Chord and discord

 Illarranged notes produce discord Tones of the
586 human mind may be different but they should be con
 cordant in order to blend properly Unselfish
 ambition noble lifemotives and purity 
589 these constituents of thought mingling constitute in
 dividually and collectively true happiness strength and
 permanence

 Mutual freedom

5812 There is moral freedom in Soul Never contract the
 horizon of a worthy outlook by the selfish exaction of
 all anothers time and thoughts With ad
5815 ditional joys benevolence should grow more
 diffusive The narrowness and jealousy which would
 confine a wife or a husband forever within four walls will
5818 not promote the sweet interchange of confidence and love
 but on the other hand a wandering desire for incessant
 amusement outside the home circle is a poor augury for
5821 the happiness of wedlock Home is the dearest spot on
 earth and it should be the centre though not the bound
 ary of the affections

 A useful suggestion

5824 Said the peasant bride to her lover Two eat no more
 together than they eat separately This is a hint that
 a wife ought not to court vulgar extravagance
5827 or stupid ease because another supplies her
 wants Wealth may obviate the necessity for toil or the
 chance for illnature in the marriage relation but noth
5830 ing can abolish the cares of marriage

 Differing duties

 She that is married careth    how she may please
 her husband says the Bible and this is the pleasantest
591 thing to do Matrimony should never be entered into
 without a full recognition of its enduring obligations on
593 both sides There should be the most tender
 solicitude for each others happiness and mu
 tual attention and approbation should wait on all the years
596 of married life

 Mutual compromises will often maintain a compact
 which might otherwise become unbearable Man should
599 not be required to participate in all the annoyances and
 cares of domestic economy nor should woman be ex
 pected to understand political economy Fulfilling the
5912 different demands of their united spheres their sympa
 thies should blend in sweet confidence and cheer each
 partner sustaining the other  thus hallowing the union
5915 of interests and affections in which the heart finds peace
 and home

 Trysting renewed

 Tender words and unselfish care in what promotes the
5918 welfare and happiness of your wife will prove more salutary
 in prolonging her health and smiles than stolid
 indifference or jealousy Husbands hear this
5921 and remember how slight a word or deed may renew the
 old trystingtimes

 After marriage it is too late to grumble over incompati
5924 bility of disposition A mutual understanding should
 exist before this union and continue ever after for decep
 tion is fatal to happiness

 Permanent obligation

5927 The nuptial vow should never be annulled so long as
 its moral obligations are kept intact but the frequency
 of divorce shows that the sacredness of this re
5930 lationship is losing its influence and that fatal
 mistakes are undermining its foundations Separation
 never should take place and it never would if both
601 husband and wife were genuine Christian Scientists
 Science inevitably lifts ones being higher in the scale of
603 harmony and happiness

 Permanent affection

 Kindred tastes motives and aspirations are necessary
 to the formation of a happy and permanent companion
606 ship The beautiful in character is also the
 good welding indissolubly the links of affec
 tion A mothers affection cannot be weaned from her
609 child because the motherlove includes purity and con
 stancy both of which are immortal Therefore maternal
 affection lives on under whatever difficulties
6012 From the logic of events we learn that selfishness
 and impurity alone are fleeting and that wisdom will
 ultimately put asunder what she hath not joined
6015 together

 Centre for affections

 Marriage should improve the human species becoming
 a barrier against vice a protection to woman strength to
6018 man and a centre for the affections This
 however in a majority of cases is not its
 present tendency and why Because the education of
6021 the higher nature is neglected and other considerations
  passion frivolous amusements personal adornment
 display and pride  occupy thought

 Spiritual concord

6024 An illattuned ear calls discord harmony not appreciat
 ing concord So physical sense not discerning the true
 happiness of being places it on a false basis
6027 Science will correct the discord and teach us
 lifes sweeter harmonies

 Soul has infinite resources with which to bless mankind
6030 and happiness would be more readily attained and would
 be more secure in our keeping if sought in Soul Higher
 enjoyments alone can satisfy the cravings of immortal
611 man We cannot circumscribe happiness within the
 limits of personal sense The senses confer no real
613 enjoyment

 Ascendency of good

 The good in human affections must have ascendency
 over the evil and the spiritual over the animal or happi
616 ness will never be won The attainment of
 this celestial condition would improve our
 progeny diminish crime and give higher aims to ambi
619 tion Every valley of sin must be exalted and every
 mountain of selfishness be brought low that the highway
 of our God may be prepared in Science The offspring
6112 of heavenlyminded parents inherit more intellect better
 balanced minds and sounder constitutions

 Propensities inherited

 If some fortuitous circumstance places promising chil
6115 dren in the arms of gross parents often these beautiful
 children early droop and die like tropical
 flowers born amid Alpine snows If perchance
6118 they live to become parents in their turn they may re
 produce in their own helpless little ones the grosser traits
 of their ancestors What hope of happiness what noble
6121 ambition can inspire the child who inherits propensities
 that must either be overcome or reduce him to a loath
 some wreck

6124 Is not the propagation of the human species a greater
 responsibility a more solemn charge than the culture of
 your garden or the raising of stock to increase your flocks
6127 and herds Nothing unworthy of perpetuity should be
 transmitted to children

 The formation of mortals must greatly improve to
6130 advance mankind The scientific morale of marriage is
 spiritual unity If the propagation of a higher human
 species is requisite to reach this goal then its material con
621 ditions can only be permitted for the purpose of gener
 ating The foetus must be kept mentally pure and the
623 period of gestation have the sanctity of virginity

 The entire education of children should be such as to
 form habits of obedience to the moral and spiritual law
626 with which the child can meet and master the belief in so
 called physical laws a belief which breeds disease

 Inheritance heeded

 If parents create in their babes a desire for incessant
629 amusement to be always fed rocked tossed or talked
 to those parents should not in after years
 complain of their childrens fretfulness or fri
6212 volity which the parents themselves have occasioned
 Taking less thought for your life what ye shall eat or
 what ye shall drink less thought for your body what
6215 ye shall put on will do much more for the health of the
 rising generation than you dream Children should be
 allowed to remain children in knowledge and should
6218 become men and women only through growth in the
 understanding of mans higher nature

 The Mind creative

 We must not attribute more and more intelligence
6221 to matter but less and less if we would be wise and
 healthy The divine Mind which forms the
 bud and blossom will care for the human
6224 body even as it clothes the lily but let no mortal inter
 fere with Gods government by thrusting in the laws of
 erring human concepts

 Superior law of Soul

6227 The higher nature of man is not governed by the lower
 if it were the order of wisdom would be reversed
 Our false views of life hide eternal harmony
6230 and produce the ills of which we complain
 Because mortals believe in material laws and reject the
 Science of Mind this does not make materiality first and
631 the superior law of Soul last You would never think
 that flannel was better for warding off pulmonary disease
633 than the controlling Mind if you understood the Science
 of being

 Spiritual origin

 In Science man is the offspring of Spirit The beauti
636 ful good and pure constitute his ancestry His origin is
 not like that of mortals in brute instinct nor
 does he pass through material conditions prior
639 to reaching intelligence Spirit is his primitive and ulti
 mate source of being God is his Father and Life is the
 law of his being

 The rights of woman

6312 Civil law establishes very unfair differences between the
 rights of the two sexes Christian Science furnishes no
 precedent for such injustice and civilization
6315 mitigates it in some measure Still it is a
 marvel why usage should accord woman less rights than
 does either Christian Science or civilization

 Unfair discrimination

6318 Our laws are not impartial to say the least in their
 discrimination as to the person property and parental
 claims of the two sexes If the elective fran
6321 chise for women will remedy the evil with
 out encouraging difficulties of greater magnitude let us
 hope it will be granted A feasible as well as rational
6324 means of improvement at present is the elevation of
 society in general and the achievement of a nobler
 race for legislation  a race having higher aims and
6327 motives

 If a dissolute husband deserts his wife certainly the
 wronged and perchance impoverished woman should be
6330 allowed to collect her own wages enter into business
 agreements hold real estate deposit funds and own her
 children free from interference

641 Want of uniform justice is a crying evil caused by the
 selfishness and inhumanity of man Our forefathers
643 exercised their faith in the direction taught by the Apostle
 James when he said Pure religion and undefiled before
 God and the Father is this To visit the fatherless and
646 widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted
 from the world

 Benevolence hindered

 Pride envy or jealousy seems on most occasions to
649 be the master of ceremonies ruling out primitive Chris
 tianity When a man lends a helping hand
 to some noble woman struggling alone with
6412 adversity his wife should not say It is never well to
 interfere with your neighbors business A wife is
 sometimes debarred by a covetous domestic tyrant from
6415 giving the ready aid her sympathy and charity would
 afford

 Progressive development

 Marriage should signify a union of hearts Further
6418 more the time cometh of which Jesus spake when he
 declared that in the resurrection there should
 be no more marrying nor giving in marriage
6421 but man would be as the angels Then shall Soul re
 joice in its own in which passion has no part Then
 whiterobed purity will unite in one person masculine wis
6424 dom and feminine love spiritual understanding and per
 petual peace

 Until it is learned that God is the Father of all mar
6427 riage will continue Let not mortals permit a disregard
 of law which might lead to a worse state of society than
 now exists Honesty and virtue ensure the stability of
6430 the marriage covenant Spirit will ultimately claim its
 own  all that really is  and the voices of physical
 sense will be forever hushed

 Blessing of Christ

651 Experience should be the school of virtue and human
 happiness should proceed from mans highest nature
653 May Christ Truth be present at every bridal
 altar to turn the water into wine and to give to
 human life an inspiration by which mans spiritual and
656 eternal existence may be discerned

 Righteous foundations

 If the foundations of human affection are consistent
 with progress they will be strong and enduring Divorces
659 should warn the age of some fundamental error
 in the marriage state The union of the sexes
 suffers fearful discord To gain Christian Science and its
6512 harmony life should be more metaphysically regarded

 Powerless promises

 The broadcast powers of evil so conspicuous today
 show themselves in the materialism and sensualism of
6515 the age struggling against the advancing
 spiritual era Beholding the worlds lack of
 Christianity and the powerlessness of vows to make home
6518 happy the human mind will at length demand a higher
 affection

 Transition and reform

 There will ensue a fermentation over this as over many
6521 other reforms until we get at last the clear straining of
 truth and impurity and error are left among
 the lees The fermentation even of fluids is
6524 not pleasant An unsettled transitional stage is never
 desirable on its own account Matrimony which was once
 a fixed fact among us must lose its present slippery foot
6527 ing and man must find permanence and peace in a more
 spiritual adherence

 The mental chemicalization which has brought con
6530 jugal infidelity to the surface will assuredly throw off
 this evil and marriage will become purer when the scum
 is gone

 Thou art right immortal Shakespeare great poet of
 humanity
663 Sweet are the uses of adversity
 Which like the toad ugly and venomous
 Wears yet a precious jewel in his head

 Salutary sorrow

666 Trials teach mortals not to lean on a material staff 
 a broken reed which pierces the heart We do not
 half remember this in the sunshine of joy
669 and prosperity Sorrow is salutary Through
 great tribulation we enter the kingdom Trials are
 proofs of Gods care Spiritual development germi
6612 nates not from seed sown in the soil of material hopes
 but when these decay Love propagates anew the higher
 joys of Spirit which have no taint of earth Each suc
6615 cessive stage of experience unfolds new views of divine
 goodness and love

 Amidst gratitude for conjugal felicity it is well to re
6618 member how fleeting are human joys Amidst conjugal
 infelicity it is well to hope pray and wait patiently on
 divine wisdom to point out the path

 Patience is wisdom

6621 Husbands and wives should never separate if there
 is no Christian demand for it It is better to await the
 logic of events than for a wife precipitately
6624 to leave her husband or for a husband to
 leave his wife If one is better than the other as must
 always be the case the other preeminently needs good
6627 company Socrates considered patience salutary under
 such circumstances making his Xantippe a discipline for
 his philosophy

 The gold and dross

6630 Sorrow has its reward It never leaves us
 where it found us The furnace separates
 the gold from the dross that the precious metal may
671 be graven with the image of God The cup our Father
 hath given shall we not drink it and learn the lessons
673 He teaches

 Weathering the storm

 When the ocean is stirred by a storm then the clouds
 lower the wind shrieks through the tightened shrouds
676 and the waves lift themselves into mountains
 We ask the helmsman Do you know your
 course Can you steer safely amid the storm He
679 answers bravely but even the dauntless seaman is not
 sure of his safety nautical science is not equal to the
 Science of Mind Yet acting up to his highest under
6712 standing firm at the post of duty the mariner works on
 and awaits the issue Thus should we deport ourselves
 on the seething ocean of sorrow Hoping and work
6715 ing one should stick to the wreck until an irresistible
 propulsion precipitates his doom or sunshine gladdens
 the troubled sea

 Spiritual power

6718 The notion that animal natures can possibly give force
 to character is too absurd for consideration when we
 remember that through spiritual ascendency
6721 our Lord and Master healed the sick raised
 the dead and commanded even the winds and waves to
 obey him Grace and Truth are potent beyond all other
6724 means and methods

 The lack of spiritual power in the limited demonstration
 of popular Christianity does not put to silence the labor
6727 of centuries Spiritual not corporeal consciousness is
 needed Man delivered from sin disease and death
 presents the true likeness or spiritual ideal

 Basis of true religion

6730 Systems of religion and medicine treat of physical pains
 and pleasures but Jesus rebuked the suffering from any
 such cause or effect The epoch approaches when the
681 understanding of the truth of being will be the basis of
 true religion At present mortals progress slowly for
683 fear of being thought ridiculous They are
 slaves to fashion pride and sense Some
 time we shall learn how Spirit the great architect has
686 created men and women in Science We ought to weary
 of the fleeting and false and to cherish nothing which
 hinders our highest selfhood

689 Jealousy is the grave of affection The presence of
 mistrust where confidence is due withers the flowers
 of Eden and scatters loves petals to decay Be not
6812 in haste to take the vow until death do us part
 Consider its obligations its responsibilities its rela
 tions to your growth and to your influence on other
6815 lives

 Insanity and agamogenesis

 I never knew more than one individual who believed
 in agamogenesis she was unmarried a lovely charac
6818 ter was suffering from incipient insanity and
 a Christian Scientist cured her I have named
 her case to individuals when casting my bread upon
6821 the waters and it may have caused the good to ponder
 and the evil to hatch their silly innuendoes and lies since
 salutary causes sometimes incur these effects The per
6824 petuation of the floral species by bud or celldivision is
 evident but I discredit the belief that agamogenesis
 applies to the human species

 Gods creation intact

6827 Christian Science presents unfoldment not accretion
 it manifests no material growth from molecule to mind
 but an impartation of the divine Mind to man
6830 and the universe Proportionately as human
 generation ceases the unbroken links of eternal har
 monious being will be spiritually discerned and man
691 not of the earth earthly but coexistent with God will
 appear The scientific fact that man and the universe
693 are evolved from Spirit and so are spiritual is as fixed in
 divine Science as is the proof that mortals gain the sense
 of health only as they lose the sense of sin and disease
696 Mortals can never understand Gods creation while believ
 ing that man is a creator Gods children already created
 will be cognized only as man finds the truth of being
699 Thus it is that the real ideal man appears in proportion
 as the false and material disappears No longer to marry
 or to be given in marriage neither closes mans con
6912 tinuity nor his sense of increasing number in Gods in
 finite plan Spiritually to understand that there is but
 one creator God unfolds all creation confirms the Scrip
6915 tures brings the sweet assurance of no parting no pain
 and of man deathless and perfect and eternal

 If Christian Scientists educate their own offspring
6918 spiritually they can educate others spiritually and not
 conflict with the scientific sense of Gods creation Some
 day the child will ask his parent Do you keep the First
6921 Commandment Do you have one God and creator or
 is man a creator If the father replies God creates
 man through man the child may ask Do you teach
6924 that Spirit creates materially or do you declare that
 Spirit is infinite therefore matter is out of the ques
 tion Jesus said The children of this world marry
6927 and are given in marriage But they which shall be ac
 counted worthy to obtain that world and the resur
 rection from the dead neither marry nor are given in
6930 marriage




 CHAPTER IV  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE VERSUS SPIRITUALISM

 And when they shall say unto you
 Seek unto them that have familiar spirits
 And unto wizards that peep and that mutter
 Should not a people seek unto their God  ISAIAH

 Verily verily I say unto you If a man keep my saying he
 shall never see death Then said the Jews unto him Now we
 know that thou hast a devil  JOHN

 The infinite one Spirit

701 MORTAL existence is an enigma Every day is a
 mystery The testimony of the corporeal senses
703 cannot inform us what is real and what is delusive but
 the revelations of Christian Science unlock the treasures
 of Truth Whatever is false or sinful can
706 never enter the atmosphere of Spirit There
 is but one Spirit Man is never God but spiritual man
 made in Gods likeness reflects God In this scientific
709 reflection the Ego and the Father are inseparable The
 supposition that corporeal beings are spirits or that there
 are good and evil spirits is a mistake

 Real and unreal identity

7012 The divine Mind maintains all identities from a blade
 of grass to a star as distinct and eternal The
 questions are What are Gods identities
7015 What is Soul Does life or soul exist in the thing
 formed

711 Nothing is real and eternal  nothing is Spirit  but
 God and His idea Evil has no reality It is neither
713 person place nor thing but is simply a belief an illusion
 of material sense

 The identity or idea of all reality continues forever
716 but Spirit or the divine Principle of all is not in Spirits
 formations Soul is synonymous with Spirit God the
 creative governing infinite Principle outside of finite form
719 which forms only reflect

 Dreamlessons

 Close your eyes and you may dream that you see a
 flower  that you touch and smell it Thus you learn
7112 that the flower is a product of the socalled
 mind a formation of thought rather than of
 matter Close your eyes again and you may see land
7115 scapes men and women Thus you learn that these
 also are images which mortal mind holds and evolves
 and which simulate mind life and intelligence From
7118 dreams also you learn that neither mortal mind nor
 matter is the image or likeness of God and that im
 mortal Mind is not in matter

 Found wanting

7121 When the Science of Mind is understood spiritualism
 will be found mainly erroneous having no scientific basis
 nor origin no proof nor power outside of
7124 human testimony It is the offspring of the
 physical senses There is no sensuality in Spirit I never
 could believe in spiritualism

7127 The basis and structure of spiritualism are alike ma
 terial and physical Its spirits are so many corporealities
 limited and finite in character and quality Spiritualism
7130 therefore presupposes Spirit which is ever infinite to be
 a corporeal being a finite form  a theory contrary to
 Christian Science

721 There is but one spiritual existence  the Life of
 which corporeal sense can take no cognizance The
723 divine Principle of man speaks through immortal sense
 If a material body  in other words mortal material
 sense  were permeated by Spirit that body would
726 disappear to mortal sense would be deathless A con
 dition precedent to communion with Spirit is the gain of
 spiritual life
 Spirits obsolete

729 Socalled spirits are but corporeal communicators As
 light destroys darkness and in the place of darkness all
 is light so in absolute Science Soul or God
7212 is the only truthgiver to man Truth de
 stroys mortality and brings to light immortality Mortal
 belief the material sense of life and immortal Truth
7215 the spiritual sense are the tares and the wheat which
 are not united by progress but separated

 Perfection is not expressed through imperfection
7218 Spirit is not made manifest through matter the anti
 pode of Spirit Error is not a convenient sieve through
 which truth can be strained

 Scientific phenomena

7221 God good being ever present it follows in divine
 logic that evil the suppositional opposite of good is never
 present In Science individual good derived
7224 from God the infinite Allinall may flow
 from the departed to mortals but evil is neither com
 municable nor scientific A sinning earthly mortal is
7227 not the reality of Life nor the medium through which
 truth passes to earth The joy of intercourse becomes
 the jest of sin when evil and suffering are communicable
7230 Not personal intercommunion but divine law is the com
 municator of truth health and harmony to earth and
 humanity As readily can you mingle fire and frost as
731 Spirit and matter In either case one does not support
 the other

733 Spiritualism calls one person living in this world ma
 terial but another who has died today a sinner and sup
 posedly will return to earth tomorrow it terms a spirit
736 The fact is that neither the one nor the other is infinite
 Spirit for Spirit is God and man is His likeness

 One government

 The belief that one man as spirit can control an
739 other man as matter upsets both the individuality and
 the Science of man for man is image God
 controls man and God is the only Spirit Any
7312 other control or attraction of socalled spirit is a mortal
 belief which ought to be known by its fruit  the repe
 tition of evil

7315 If Spirit or God communed with mortals or controlled
 them through electricity or any other form of matter the
 divine order and the Science of omnipotent omnipresent
7318 Spirit would be destroyed

 Incorrect theories

 The belief that material bodies return to dust hereafter
 to rise up as spiritual bodies with material sensations and
7321 desires is incorrect Equally incorrect is the
 belief that spirit is confined in a finite ma
 terial body from which it is freed by death and that when
7324 it is freed from the material body spirit retains the sensa
 tions belonging to that body

 No mediumship

 It is a grave mistake to suppose that matter is any part
7327 of the reality of intelligent existence or that Spirit and
 matter intelligence and nonintelligence can
 commune together This error Science will
7330 destroy The sensual cannot be made the mouthpiece of
 the spiritual nor can the finite become the channel of
 the infinite There is no communication between so
741 called material existence and spiritual life which is not
 subject to death

 Opposing conditions

743 To be on communicable terms with Spirit persons must
 be free from organic bodies and their return to a mate
 rial condition after having once left it would
746 be as impossible as would be the restoration
 to its original condition of the acorn already absorbed
 into a sprout which has risen above the soil The seed
749 which has germinated has a new form and state of exist
 ence When here or hereafter the belief of life in matter
 is extinct the error which has held the belief dissolves
7412 with the belief and never returns to the old condition
 No correspondence nor communion can exist between
 persons in such opposite dreams as the belief of having
7415 died and left a material body and the belief of still living
 in an organic material body

 Bridgeless division

 The caterpillar transformed into a beautiful insect
7418 is no longer a worm nor does the insect return to
 fraternize with or control the worm Such
 a backward transformation is impossible in
7421 Science Darkness and light infancy and manhood
 sickness and health are opposites  different beliefs
 which never blend Who will say that infancy can utter
7424 the ideas of manhood that darkness can represent light
 that we are in Europe when we are in the opposite hemi
 sphere There is no bridge across the gulf which divides
7427 two such opposite conditions as the spiritual or incor
 poreal and the physical or corporeal

 In Christian Science there is never a retrograde step
7430 never a return to positions outgrown The socalled dead
 and living cannot commune together for they are in
 separate states of existence or consciousness

 Unscientific investiture

751 This simple truth lays bare the mistaken assumption
 that man dies as matter but comes to life as spirit The
753 socalled dead in order to reappear to those
 still in the existence cognized by the physical
 senses would need to be tangible and material  to have
756 a material investiture  or the material senses could take
 no cognizance of the socalled dead

 Spiritualism would transfer men from the spiritual sense
759 of existence back into its material sense This gross mate
 rialism is scientifically impossible since to infinite Spirit
 there can be no matter

 Raising the dead

7512 Jesus said of Lazarus Our friend Lazarus sleepeth
 but I go that I may awake him out of sleep Jesus
 restored Lazarus by the understanding that
7515 Lazarus had never died not by an admis
 sion that his body had died and then lived again Had
 Jesus believed that Lazarus had lived or died in his
7518 body the Master would have stood on the same plane of
 belief as those who buried the body and he could not have
 resuscitated it

7521 When you can waken yourself or others out of the belief
 that all must die you can then exercise Jesus spiritual
 power to reproduce the presence of those who have thought
7524 they died  but not otherwise

 Vision of the dying

 There is one possible moment when those living on the
 earth and those called dead can commune together and
7527 that is the moment previous to the transition
  the moment when the link between their op
 posite beliefs is being sundered In the vestibule through
7530 which we pass from one dream to another dream or
 when we awake from earths sleep to the grand verities
 of Life the departing may hear the glad welcome of those
761 who have gone before The ones departing may whisper
 this vision name the face that smiles on them and the
763 hand which beckons them as one at Niagara with eyes
 open only to that wonder forgets all else and breathes
 aloud his rapture

 Real Life is God

766 When being is understood Life will be recognized as
 neither material nor finite but as infinite  as God
 universal good and the belief that life or
769 mind was ever in a finite form or good in
 evil will be destroyed Then it will be understood that
 Spirit never entered matter and was therefore never
7612 raised from matter When advanced to spiritual being
 and the understanding of God man can no longer com
 mune with matter neither can he return to it any more
7615 than a tree can return to its seed Neither will man seem
 to be corporeal but he will be an individual conscious
 ness characterized by the divine Spirit as idea not matter

7618 Suffering sinning dying beliefs are unreal When
 divine Science is universally understood they will have
 no power over man for man is immortal and lives by
7621 divine authority

 Immaterial pleasure

 The sinless joy  the perfect harmony and immortality
 of Life possessing unlimited divine beauty and goodness
7624 without a single bodily pleasure or pain 
 constitutes the only veritable indestructible
 man whose being is spiritual This state of existence
7627 is scientific and intact  a perfection discernible only
 by those who have the final understanding of Christ in
 divine Science Death can never hasten this state of
7630 existence for death must be overcome not submitted to
 before immortality appears

 The recognition of Spirit and of infinity comes not
771 suddenly here or hereafter The pious Polycarp said
 I cannot turn at once from good to evil Neither do
773 other mortals accomplish the change from error to truth
 at a single bound

 Second death

 Existence continues to be a belief of corporeal sense
776 until the Science of being is reached Error brings its
 own selfdestruction both here and hereafter
 for mortal mind creates its own physical con
779 ditions Death will occur on the next plane of existence
 as on this until the spiritual understanding of Life is
 reached Then and not until then will it be demon
7712 strated that the second death hath no power

 A dream vanishing

 The period required for this dream of material life
 embracing its socalled pleasures and pains to vanish
7715 from consciousness knoweth no man   
 neither the Son but the Father This period
 will be of longer or shorter duration according to the
7718 tenacity of error Of what advantage then would it be
 to us or to the departed to prolong the material state and
 so prolong the illusion either of a soul inert or of a sinning
7721 suffering sense  a socalled mind fettered to matter

 Progress and purgatory

 Even if communications from spirits to mortal con
 sciousness were possible such communications would
7724 grow beautifully less with every advanced stage
 of existence The departed would gradually
 rise above ignorance and materiality and Spiritualists
7727 would outgrow their beliefs in material spiritualism
 Spiritism consigns the socalled dead to a state resembling
 that of blighted buds  to a wretched purgatory where
7730 the chances of the departed for improvement narrow
 into nothing and they return to their old standpoints of
 matter

 Unnatural deflections

781 The decaying flower the blighted bud the gnarled oak
 the ferocious beast  like the discords of disease sin
783 and death  are unnatural They are the fal
 sities of sense the changing deflections of mor
 tal mind they are not the eternal realities of Mind

 Absurd oracles

786 How unreasonable is the belief that we are wearing
 out life and hastening to death and that at the same
 time we are communing with immortality
789 If the departed are in rapport with mor
 tality or matter they are not spiritual but must still
 be mortal sinning suffering and dying Then why
7812 look to them  even were communication possible  for
 proofs of immortality and accept them as oracles Com
 munications gathered from ignorance are pernicious in
7815 tendency

 Spiritualism with its material accompaniments would
 destroy the supremacy of Spirit If Spirit pervades all
7818 space it needs no material method for the transmission
 of messages Spirit needs no wires nor electricity in order
 to be omnipresent

 Spirit intangible

7821 Spirit is not materially tangible How then can it
 communicate with man through electric material effects
 How can the majesty and omnipotence of
7824 Spirit be lost God is not in the medley
 where matter cares for matter where spiritism makes
 many gods and hypnotism and electricity are claimed
7827 to be the agents of Gods government

 Spirit blesses man but man cannot tell whence
 it cometh By it the sick are healed the sorrowing are
7830 comforted and the sinning are reformed These are the
 effects of one universal God the invisible good dwelling
 in eternal Science

 Thought regarding death

791 The act of describing disease  its symptoms locality
 and fatality  is not scientific Warning people against
793 death is an error that tends to frighten into
 death those who are ignorant of Life as God
 Thousands of instances could be cited of health restored
796 by changing the patients thoughts regarding death

 Fallacious hypotheses

 A scientific mental method is more sanitary than the
 use of drugs and such a mental method produces perma
799 nent health Science must go over the whole
 ground and dig up every seed of errors sow
 ing Spiritualism relies upon human beliefs and hy
7912 potheses Christian Science removes these beliefs and
 hypotheses through the higher understanding of God for
 Christian Science resting on divine Principle not on ma
7915 terial personalities in its revelation of immortality intro
 duces the harmony of being

 Jesus cast out evil spirits or false beliefs The Apostle
7918 Paul bade men have the Mind that was in the Christ
 Jesus did his own work by the one Spirit He said My
 Father worketh hitherto and I work He never de
7921 scribed disease so far as can be learned from the Gospels
 but he healed disease

 Mistaken methods

 The unscientific practitioner says You are ill Your
7924 brain is overtaxed and you must rest Your body is
 weak and it must be strengthened You have
 nervous prostration and must be treated for it
7927 Science objects to all this contending for the rights of in
 telligence and asserting that Mind controls body and brain

 Divine strength

 Mindscience teaches that mortals need not be weary
7930 in well doing It dissipates fatigue in doing
 good Giving does not impoverish us in the
 service of our Maker neither does withholding enrich us
801 We have strength in proportion to our apprehension of
 the truth and our strength is not lessened by giving
803 utterance to truth A cup of coffee or tea is not the equal
 of truth whether for the inspiration of a sermon or for
 the support of bodily endurance

 A denial of immortality

806 A communication purporting to come from the late
 Theodore Parker reads as follows There never was
 and there never will be an immortal spirit
809 Yet the very periodical containing this sen
 tence repeats weekly the assertion that spiritcommunica
 tions are our only proofs of immortality

 Mysticism unscientific

8012 I entertain no doubt of the humanity and philanthropy
 of many Spiritualists but I cannot coincide with their
 views It is mysticism which gives spiritual
8015 ism its force Science dispels mystery and
 explains extraordinary phenomena but Science never
 removes phenomena from the domain of reason into the
8018 realm of mysticism

 Physical falsities

 It should not seem mysterious that mind without the
 aid of hands can move a table when we already know
8021 that it is mindpower which moves both table
 and hand Even planchette  the French toy
 which years ago pleased so many people  attested the con
8024 trol of mortal mind over its substratum called matter

 It is mortal mind which convulses its substratum matter
 These movements arise from the volition of human belief
8027 but they are neither scientific nor rational Mortal mind
 produces tabletipping as certainly as tablesetting and
 believes that this wonder emanates from spirits and elec
8030 tricity This belief rests on the common conviction that
 mind and matter cooperate both visibly and invisibly
 hence that matter is intelligent

 Poor postmortem evidence

811 There is not so much evidence to prove intercommuni
 cation between the socalled dead and the living as there
813 is to show the sick that matter suffers and has
 sensation yet this latter evidence is destroyed by
 the Mindscience If Spiritualists understood the
816 Science of being their belief in mediumship would vanish

 No proof of immortality

 At the very best and on its own theories spiritualism
 can only prove that certain individuals have a continued
819 existence after death and maintain their affili
 ation with mortal flesh but this fact affords
 no certainty of everlasting life A mans assertion that
8112 he is immortal no more proves him to be so than the op
 posite assertion that he is mortal would prove immor
 tality a lie Nor is the case improved when alleged spirits
8115 teach immortality Life Love Truth is the only proof
 of immortality

 Minds manifestations immortal

 Man in the likeness of God as revealed in Science can
8118 not help being immortal Though the grass seemeth to
 wither and the flower to fade they reappear
 Erase the figures which express number silence
8121 the tones of music give to the worms the body
 called man and yet the producing governing divine
 Principle lives on  in the case of man as truly as in
8124 the case of numbers and of music  despite the socalled
 laws of matter which define man as mortal Though
 the inharmony resulting from material sense hides the
8127 harmony of Science inharmony cannot destroy the divine
 Principle of Science In Science mans immortality de
 pends upon that of God good and follows as a necessary
8130 consequence of the immortality of good

 Reading thoughts

 That somebody somewhere must have known the
 deceased person supposed to be the communicator is
821 evident and it is as easy to read distant thoughts as near
 We think of an absent friend as easily as we do of one
823 present It is no more difficult to read the
 absent mind than it is to read the present
 Chaucer wrote centuries ago yet we still read his thought
826 in his verse What is classic study but discernment of
 the minds of Homer and Virgil of whose personal exist
 ence we may be in doubt

 Impossible intercommunion

829 If spiritual life has been won by the departed they
 cannot return to material existence because different
 states of consciousness are involved and one
8212 person cannot exist in two different states of
 consciousness at the same time In sleep we
 do not communicate with the dreamer by our side despite
8215 his physical proximity because both of us are either un
 conscious or are wandering in our dreams through differ
 ent mazes of consciousness

8218 In like manner it would follow even if our departed
 friends were near us and were in as conscious a state of
 existence as before the change we call death that their
8221 state of consciousness must be different from ours We
 are not in their state nor are they in the mental realm
 in which we dwell Communion between them and
8224 ourselves would be prevented by this difference The
 mental states are so unlike that intercommunion is as
 impossible as it would be between a mole and a human
8227 being Different dreams and different awakenings be
 token a differing consciousness When wandering in
 Australia do we look for help to the Esquimaux in their
8230 snow huts

 In a world of sin and sensuality hastening to a
 greater development of power it is wise earnestly to
831 consider whether it is the human mind or the divine
 Mind which is influencing one What the prophets of
833 Jehovah did the worshippers of Baal failed to do yet
 artifice and delusion claimed that they could equal the
 work of wisdom

836 Science only can explain the incredible good and evil
 elements now coming to the surface Mortals must find
 refuge in Truth in order to escape the error of these latter
839 days Nothing is more antagonistic to Christian Science
 than a blind belief without understanding for such a
 belief hides Truth and builds on error

 Natural wonders

8312 Miracles are impossible in Science and here Science
 takes issue with popular religions The scientific mani
 festation of power is from the divine nature
8315 and is not supernatural since Science is an
 explication of nature The belief that the universe in
 cluding man is governed in general by material laws but
8318 that occasionally Spirit sets aside these laws  this be
 lief belittles omnipotent wisdom and gives to matter the
 precedence over Spirit

 Conflicting standpoints

8321 It is contrary to Christian Science to suppose that life
 is either material or organically spiritual Between
 Christian Science and all forms of superstition
8324 a great gulf is fixed as impassable as that be
 tween Dives and Lazarus There is mortal mindreading
 and immortal Mindreading The latter is a revelation
8327 of divine purpose through spiritual understanding by
 which man gains the divine Principle and explanation of
 all things Mortal mindreading and immortal Mind
8330 reading are distinctly opposite standpoints from which
 cause and effect are interpreted The act of reading
 mortal mind investigates and touches only human beliefs
841 Science is immortal and coordinate neither with the
 premises nor with the conclusions of mortal beliefs

 Scientific foreseeing

843 The ancient prophets gained their foresight from a
 spiritual incorporeal standpoint not by foreshadowing
 evil and mistaking fact for fiction  predict
846 ing the future from a groundwork of corpo
 reality and human belief When sufficiently advanced
 in Science to be in harmony with the truth of being men
849 become seers and prophets involuntarily controlled not
 by demons spirits or demigods but by the one Spirit
 It is the prerogative of the everpresent divine Mind and
8412 of thought which is in rapport with this Mind to know
 the past the present and the future

 Acquaintance with the Science of being enables us to
8415 commune more largely with the divine Mind to foresee
 and foretell events which concern the universal welfare
 to be divinely inspired  yea to reach the range of fetter
8418 less Mind

 The Mind unbounded

 To understand that Mind is infinite not bounded by
 corporeality not dependent upon the ear and eye for
8421 sound or sight nor upon muscles and bones
 for locomotion is a step towards the Mind
 science by which we discern mans nature and existence
8424 This true conception of being destroys the belief of spirit
 ualism at its very inception for without the concession of
 material personalities called spirits spiritualism has no
8427 basis upon which to build

 Scientific foreknowing

 All we correctly know of Spirit comes from God divine
 Principle and is learned through Christ and Christian
8430 Science If this Science has been thoroughly
 learned and properly digested we can know
 the truth more accurately than the astronomer can read
851 the stars or calculate an eclipse This Mindreading
 is the opposite of clairvoyance It is the illumination of
853 the spiritual understanding which demonstrates the ca
 pacity of Soul not of material sense This Soulsense
 comes to the human mind when the latter yields to the
856 divine Mind

 Value of intuition

 Such intuitions reveal whatever constitutes and per
 petuates harmony enabling one to do good but not
859 evil You will reach the perfect Science of
 healing when you are able to read the human
 mind after this manner and discern the error you would
8512 destroy The Samaritan woman said Come see a
 man which told me all things that ever I did is not this
 the Christ

8515 It is recorded that Jesus as he once journeyed with his
 students knew their thoughts  read them scientifi
 cally In like manner he discerned disease and healed
8518 the sick After the same method events of great mo
 ment were foretold by the Hebrew prophets Our
 Master rebuked the lack of this power when he said
8521 O ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky
 but can ye not discern the signs of the times

 Hypocrisy condemned

 Both Jew and Gentile may have had acute corporeal
8524 senses but mortals need spiritual sense Jesus knew the
 generation to be wicked and adulterous seek
 ing the material more than the spiritual His
8527 thrusts at materialism were sharp but needed He never
 spared hypocrisy the sternest condemnation He said
 These ought ye to have done and not to leave the other
8530 undone The great Teacher knew both cause and
 effect knew that truth communicates itself but never
 imparts error

 Mental contact

861 Jesus once asked Who touched me Supposing
 this inquiry to be occasioned by physical contact alone
863 his disciples answered The multitude throng
 thee Jesus knew as others did not that
 it was not matter but mortal mind whose touch called
866 for aid Repeating his inquiry he was answered by the
 faith of a sick woman His quick apprehension of this
 mental call illustrated his spirituality The disciples
869 misconception of it uncovered their materiality Jesus
 possessed more spiritual susceptibility than the disciples
 Opposites come from contrary directions and produce
8612 unlike results

 Images of thought

 Mortals evolve images of thought These may appear
 to the ignorant to be apparitions but they are myste
8615 rious only because it is unusual to see
 thoughts though we can always feel their
 influence Haunted houses ghostly voices unusual
8618 noises and apparitions brought out in dark seances
 either involve feats by tricksters or they are images and
 sounds evolved involuntarily by mortal mind Seeing
8621 is no less a quality of physical sense than feeling Then
 why is it more difficult to see a thought than to feel one
 Education alone determines the difference In reality
8624 there is none

 Phenomena explained

 Portraits landscapepaintings facsimiles of penman
 ship peculiarities of expression recollected sentences
8627 can all be taken from pictorial thought and
 memory as readily as from objects cognizable
 by the senses Mortal mind sees what it believes as
8630 certainly as it believes what it sees It feels hears and
 sees its own thoughts Pictures are mentally formed
 before the artist can convey them to canvas So is it
871 with all material conceptions Mindreaders perceive
 these pictures of thought They copy or reproduce
873 them even when they are lost to the memory of the mind
 in which they are discoverable

 Mental environment

 It is needless for the thought or for the person hold
876 ing the transferred picture to be individually and con
 sciously present Though individuals have
 passed away their mental environment re
879 mains to be discerned described and transmitted Though
 bodies are leagues apart and their associations forgotten
 their associations float in the general atmosphere of human
8712 mind

 Second sight

 The Scotch call such vision second sight when
 really it is first sight instead of second for it presents
8715 primal facts to mortal mind Science enables
 one to read the human mind but not as a
 clairvoyant It enables one to heal through Mind but
8718 not as a mesmerist

 Buried secrets

 The mine knows naught of the emeralds within its
 rocks the sea is ignorant of the gems within its caverns
8721 of the corals of its sharp reefs of the tall ships
 that float on its bosom or of the bodies which
 lie buried in its sands yet these are all there Do not
8724 suppose that any mental concept is gone because you do
 not think of it The true concept is never lost The
 strong impressions produced on mortal mind by friend
8727 ship or by any intense feeling are lasting and mind
 readers can perceive and reproduce these impressions

 Recollected friends

 Memory may reproduce voices long ago silent We
8730 have but to close the eyes and forms rise
 before us which are thousands of miles away
 or altogether gone from physical sight and sense and
881 this not in dreamy sleep In our daydreams we can
 recall that for which the poet Tennyson expressed the
883 hearts desire 
 the touch of a vanished hand
 And the sound of a voice that is still

886 The mind may even be cognizant of a present flavor and
 odor when no viand touches the palate and no scent
 salutes the nostrils

 Illusions not ideas

889 How are veritable ideas to be distinguished from il
 lusions By learning the origin of each Ideas are
 emanations from the divine Mind Thoughts
8812 proceeding from the brain or from matter are
 offshoots of mortal mind they are mortal material be
 liefs Ideas are spiritual harmonious and eternal Beliefs
8815 proceed from the socalled material senses which at one
 time are supposed to be substancematter and at another
 are called spirits

8818 To love ones neighbor as ones self is a divine idea
 but this idea can never be seen felt nor understood
 through the physical senses Excite the organ of ven
8821 eration or religious faith and the individual manifests
 profound adoration Excite the opposite development
 and he blasphemes These effects however do not pro
8824 ceed from Christianity nor are they spiritual phenomena
 for both arise from mortal belief

 Trance speaking illusion

 Eloquence reechoes the strains of Truth and Love
8827 It is due to inspiration rather than to erudition It shows
 the possibilities derived from divine Mind
 though it is said to be a gift whose endowment
8830 is obtained from books or received from the
 impulsion of departed spirits When eloquence proceeds
 from the belief that a departed spirit is speaking who
891 can tell what the unaided medium is incapable of know
 ing or uttering This phenomenon only shows that the
893 beliefs of mortal mind are loosed Forgetting her igno
 rance in the belief that another mind is speaking through
 her the devotee may become unwontedly eloquent Hav
896 ing more faith in others than in herself and believing
 that somebody else possesses her tongue and mind she
 talks freely

899 Destroy her belief in outside aid and her eloquence
 disappears The former limits of her belief return She
 says  I am incapable of words that glow for I am un
8912 educated This familiar instance reaffirms the Scrip
 tural word concerning a man As he thinketh in his heart
 so is he If one believes that he cannot be an orator with
8915 out study or a superinduced condition the body responds
 to this belief and the tongue grows mute which before
 was eloquent

 Scientific improvisation

8918 Mind is not necessarily dependent upon educational
 processes It possesses of itself all beauty and poetry
 and the power of expressing them Spirit
8921 God is heard when the senses are silent We
 are all capable of more than we do The influence or
 action of Soul confers a freedom which explains the phe
8924 nomena of improvisation and the fervor of untutored lips

 Divine origination

 Matter is neither intelligent nor creative The tree is
 not the author of itself Sound is not the originator of
8927 music and man is not the father of man Cain
 very naturally concluded that if life was in the
 body and man gave it man had the right to take it away
8930 This incident shows that the belief of life in matter was
 a murderer from the beginning

 If seed is necessary to produce wheat and wheat to
901 produce flour or if one animal can originate another
 how then can we account for their primal origin How
903 were the loaves and fishes multiplied on the shores of
 Galilee  and that too without meal or monad from
 which loaf or fish could come

 Mind is substance

906 The earths orbit and the imaginary line called the
 equator are not substance The earths motion and
 position are sustained by Mind alone Divest
909 yourself of the thought that there can be sub
 stance in matter and the movements and transitions now
 possible for mortal mind will be found to be equally
9012 possible for the body Then being will be recognized
 as spiritual and death will be obsolete though now
 some insist that death is the necessary prelude to
9015 immortality

 Mortal delusions

 In dreams we fly to Europe and meet a faroff friend
 The lookeron sees the body in bed but the supposed
9018 inhabitant of that body carries it through
 the air and over the ocean This shows the
 possibilities of thought Opium and hashish eaters men
9021 tally travel far and work wonders yet their bodies stay
 in one place This shows what mortal mentality and
 knowledge are

 Scientific finalities

9024 The admission to ones self that man is Gods own like
 ness sets man free to master the infinite idea This con
 viction shuts the door on death and opens it
9027 wide towards immortality The understanding
 and recognition of Spirit must finally come and we may
 as well improve our time in solving the mysteries of being
9030 through an apprehension of divine Principle At present
 we know not what man is but we certainly shall know
 this when man reflects God

911 The Revelator tells us of a new heaven and a
 new earth Have you ever pictured this heaven and
913 earth inhabited by beings under the control of supreme
 wisdom

 Let us rid ourselves of the belief that man is separated
916 from God and obey only the divine principle Life and
 Love Here is the great point of departure for all true
 spiritual growth

 Mans genuine being

919 It is difficult for the sinner to accept divine Science
 because Science exposes his nothingness but the sooner
 error is reduced to its native nothingness the
9112 sooner mans great reality will appear and his
 genuine being will be understood The destruction of
 error is by no means the destruction of Truth or Life but
9115 is the acknowledgment of them

 Absorbed in material selfhood we discern and reflect
 but faintly the substance of Life or Mind The denial of
9118 material selfhood aids the discernment of mans spirit
 ual and eternal individuality and destroys the erroneous
 knowledge gained from matter or through what are termed
9121 the material senses

 Erroneous postulates

 Certain erroneous postulates should be here considered
 in order that the spiritual facts may be better
9124 apprehended

 The first erroneous postulate of belief is that substance
 life and intelligence are something apart from God
9127 The second erroneous postulate is that man is both
 mental and material

 The third erroneous postulate is that mind is both evil
9130 and good whereas the real Mind cannot be evil nor the
 medium of evil for Mind is God

 The fourth erroneous postulate is that matter is in
921 telligent and that man has a material body which is part
 of himself

923 The fifth erroneous postulate is that matter holds in
 itself the issues of life and death  that matter is not
 only capable of experiencing pleasure and pain but also
926 capable of imparting these sensations From the illusion
 implied in this last postulate arises the decomposition of
 mortal bodies in what is termed death
929 Mind is not an entity within the cranium with the power
 of sinning now and forever

 Knowledge of good and evil

 In old Scriptural pictures we see a serpent coiled around
9212 the tree of knowledge and speaking to Adam and Eve
 This represents the serpent in the act of
 commending to our first parents the knowl
9215 edge of good and evil a knowledge gained from matter
 or evil instead of from Spirit The portrayal is still
 graphically accurate for the common conception of mor
9218 tal man  a burlesque of Gods man  is an outgrowth
 of human knowledge or sensuality a mere offshoot of
 material sense

 Opposing power

9221 Uncover error and it turns the lie upon you Until
 the fact concerning error  namely its nothingness 
 appears the moral demand will not be met
9224 and the ability to make nothing of error will
 be wanting We should blush to call that real which is
 only a mistake The foundation of evil is laid on a belief
9227 in something besides God This belief tends to support
 two opposite powers instead of urging the claims of Truth
 alone The mistake of thinking that error can be real
9230 when it is merely the absence of truth leads to belief in
 the superiority of error

 The ages privilege

 Do you say the time has not yet come in which to
931 recognize Soul as substantial and able to control the
 body Remember Jesus who nearly nineteen centuries
933 ago demonstrated the power of Spirit and said
 He that believeth on me the works that I
 do shall he do also and who also said But the hour
936 cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall
 worship the Father in spirit and in truth Behold
 now is the accepted time behold now is the day of sal
939 vation said Paul

 Logic and revelation

 Divine logic and revelation coincide If we believe
 otherwise we may be sure that either our
9312 logic is at fault or that we have misinterpreted
 revelation Good never causes evil nor creates aught
 that can cause evil

9315 Good does not create a mind susceptible of causing
 evil for evil is the opposing error and not the truth of
 creation Destructive electricity is not the offspring of in
9318 finite good Whatever contradicts the real nature of the
 divine Esse though human faith may clothe it with angelic
 vestments is without foundation

 Derivatives of spirit

9321 The belief that Spirit is finite as well as infinite has
 darkened all history In Christian Science Spirit as a
 proper noun is the name of the Supreme Being
9324 It means quantity and quality and applies ex
 clusively to God The modifying derivatives of the word
 spirit refer only to quality not to God Man is spiritual
9327 He is not God Spirit If man were Spirit then men
 would be spirits gods Finite spirit would be mortal
 and this is the error embodied in the belief that the infi
9330 nite can be contained in the finite This belief tends to
 becloud our apprehension of the kingdom of heaven and
 of the reign of harmony in the Science of being

 Scientific man

941 Jesus taught but one God one Spirit who makes man
 in the image and likeness of Himself  of Spirit not of
943 matter Man reflects infinite Truth Life and
 Love The nature of man thus understood
 includes all that is implied by the terms image and
946 likeness as used in Scripture The truly Christian
 and scientific statement of personality and of the relation
 of man to God with the demonstration which accompa
949 nied it incensed the rabbis and they said Crucify him
 crucify him    by our law he ought to die because he
 made himself the Son of God

9412 The eastern empires and nations owe their false gov
 ernment to the misconceptions of Deity there prevalent
 Tyranny intolerance and bloodshed wherever found
9415 arise from the belief that the infinite is formed after the
 pattern of mortal personality passion and impulse

 Ingratitude and denial

 The progress of truth confirms its claims and our
9418 Master confirmed his words by his works His healing
 power evoked denial ingratitude and be
 trayal arising from sensuality Of the ten
9421 lepers whom Jesus healed but one returned to give God
 thanks  that is to acknowledge the divine Principle
 which had healed him

 Spiritual insight

9424 Our Master easily read the thoughts of mankind and
 this insight better enabled him to direct those thoughts
 aright but what would be said at this period of an in
9427 fidel blasphemer who should hint that Jesus used his in
 cisive power injuriously Our Master read mortal mind
 on a scientific basis that of the omnipresence of Mind
9430 An approximation of this discernment indicates spiritual
 growth and union with the infinite capacities of the one
 Mind Jesus could injure no one by his Mindreading
951 The effect of his Mind was always to heal and to save
 and this is the only genuine Science of reading mortal
953 mind His holy motives and aims were tra
 duced by the sinners of that period as they
 would be today if Jesus were personally present Paul
956 said To be spiritually minded is life We approach
 God or Life in proportion to our spirituality our fidel
 ity to Truth and Love and in that ratio we know all
959 human need and are able to discern the thought of the
 sick and the sinning for the purpose of healing them
 Error of any kind cannot hide from the law of God

9512 Whoever reaches this point of moral culture and good
 ness cannot injure others and must do them good The
 greater or lesser ability of a Christian Scientist to discern
9515 thought scientifically depends upon his genuine spirit
 uality This kind of mindreading is not clairvoyance
 but it is important to success in healing and is one of the
9518 special characteristics thereof

 Christs reappearance

 We welcome the increase of knowledge and the end
 of error because even human invention must have its
9521 day and we want that day to be succeeded
 by Christian Science by divine reality Mid
 night foretells the dawn Led by a solitary star amid
9524 the darkness the Magi of old foretold the Messiahship
 of Truth Is the wise man of today believed when he
 beholds the light which heralds Christs eternal dawn
9527 and describes its effulgence

 Spiritual awakening

 Lulled by stupefying illusions the world is asleep
 in the cradle of infancy dreaming away the hours
9530 Material sense does not unfold the facts of
 existence but spiritual sense lifts human
 consciousness into eternal Truth Humanity advances
961 slowly out of sinning sense into spiritual understanding
 unwillingness to learn all things rightly binds Christen
963 dom with chains

 The darkest hours of all

 Love will finally mark the hour of harmony and spir
 itualization will follow for Love is Spirit Before error
966 is wholly destroyed there will be interrup
 tions of the general material routine Earth
 will become dreary and desolate but summer and winter
969 seedtime and harvest though in changed forms will
 continue unto the end  until the final spiritualization of
 all things The darkest hour precedes the dawn

 Arena of contest

9612 This material world is even now becoming the arena
 for conflicting forces On one side there will be discord
 and dismay on the other side there will be
9615 Science and peace The breaking up of mate
 rial beliefs may seem to be famine and pestilence want
 and woe sin sickness and death which assume new
9618 phases until their nothingness appears These disturb
 ances will continue until the end of error when all
 discord will be swallowed up in spiritual Truth
9621 Mortal error will vanish in a moral chemicalization
 This mental fermentation has begun and will continue
 until all errors of belief yield to understanding Belief is
9624 changeable but spiritual understanding is changeless

 Millennial glory

 As this consummation draws nearer he who has
 shaped his course in accordance with divine Science
9627 will endure to the end As material knowl
 edge diminishes and spiritual understanding
 increases real objects will be apprehended mentally
9630 instead of materially

 During this final conflict wicked minds will endeavor
 to find means by which to accomplish more evil but
971 those who discern Christian Science will hold crime in
 check They will aid in the ejection of error They
973 will maintain law and order and cheerfully await the
 certainty of ultimate perfection

 Dangerous resemblances

 In reality the more closely error simulates truth and
976 socalled matter resembles its essence mortal mind the
 more impotent error becomes as a belief Ac
 cording to human belief the lightning is fierce
979 and the electric current swift yet in Christian Science
 the flight of one and the blow of the other will become
 harmless The more destructive matter becomes the
9712 more its nothingness will appear until matter reaches
 its mortal zenith in illusion and forever disappears The
 nearer a false belief approaches truth without passing
9715 the boundary where having been destroyed by divine
 Love it ceases to be even an illusion the riper it becomes
 for destruction The more material the belief the more
9718 obvious its error until divine Spirit supreme in its do
 main dominates all matter and man is found in the like
 ness of Spirit his original being

9721 The broadest facts array the most falsities against
 themselves for they bring error from under cover It
 requires courage to utter truth for the higher Truth
9724 lifts her voice the louder will error scream until its in
 articulate sound is forever silenced in oblivion

 He uttered His voice the earth melted This Scrip
9727 ture indicates that all matter will disappear before the
 supremacy of Spirit

 Christianity still rejected

 Christianity is again demonstrating the Life that is
9730 Truth and the Truth that is Life by the apos
 tolic work of casting out error and healing the
 sick Earth has no repayment for the persecutions which
981 attend a new step in Christianity but the spiritual recom
 pense of the persecuted is assured in the elevation of ex
983 istence above mortal discord and in the gift of divine Love

 Spiritual foreshadowings

 The prophet of today beholds in the mental horizon
 the signs of these times the reappearance of the Chris
986 tianity which heals the sick and destroys error
 and no other sign shall be given Body can
 not be saved except through Mind The Science of Chris
989 tianity is misinterpreted by a material age for it is the
 healing influence of Spirit not spirits which the material
 senses cannot comprehend which can only be spiritu
9812 ally discerned Creeds doctrines and human hypotheses
 do not express Christian Science much less can they
 demonstrate it

 Revelation of Science

9815 Beyond the frail premises of human beliefs above the
 loosening grasp of creeds the demonstration of Christian
 Mindhealing stands a revealed and practical
9818 Science It is imperious throughout all ages
 as Christs revelation of Truth of Life and of Love which
 remains inviolate for every man to understand and to
9821 practise

 Science as foreign to all religion

 For centuries  yea always  natural science has not
 been considered a part of any religion Christianity not
9824 excepted Even now multitudes consider that
 which they call science has no proper con
 nection with faith and piety Mystery does
9827 not enshroud Christs teachings and they are not theo
 retical and fragmentary but practical and complete and
 being practical and complete they are not deprived of
9830 their essential vitality

 Key to the kingdom

 The way through which immortality and life are learned
 is not ecclesiastical but Christian not human but divine
991 not physical but metaphysical not material but scien
 tifically spiritual Human philosophy ethics and super
993 stition afford no demonstrable divine Principle
 by which mortals can escape from sin yet
 to escape from sin is what the Bible demands Work
996 out your own salvation with fear and trembling says
 the apostle and he straightway adds for it is God
 which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good
999 pleasure Philippians ii 12 13 Truth has furnished
 the key to the kingdom and with this key Christian Sci
 ence has opened the door of the human understanding
9912 None may pick the lock nor enter by some other door
 The ordinary teachings are material and not spiritual
 Christian Science teaches only that which is spiritual and
9915 divine and not human Christian Science is unerring
 and Divine the human sense of things errs because it
 is human

9918 Those individuals who adopt theosophy spiritualism
 or hypnotism may possess natures above some others
 who eschew their false beliefs Therefore my contest is
9921 not with the individual but with the false system I
 love mankind and shall continue to labor and to endure

 The calm strong currents of true spirituality the
9924 manifestations of which are health purity and self
 immolation must deepen human experience until the
 beliefs of material existence are seen to be a bald imposi
9927 tion and sin disease and death give everlasting place
 to the scientific demonstration of divine Spirit and to
 Gods spiritual perfect man




 CHAPTER V  ANIMAL MAGNETISM UNMASKED

 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders
 adulteries fornications thefts false witness
 blasphemies these are the things which defile a man
  JESUS

 Earliest investigations

1001 MESMERISM or animal magnetism was first brought
 into notice by Mesmer in Germany in 1775 Ac
1003 cording to the American Cyclopaedia he regarded this
 socalled force which he said could be ex
 erted by one living organism over another as
1006 a means of alleviating disease His propositions were
 as follows

 There exists a mutual influence between the celestial
1009 bodies the earth and animated things Animal bodies
 are susceptible to the influence of this agent disseminat
 ing itself through the substance of the nerves
10012 In 1784 the French government ordered the medical
 faculty of Paris to investigate Mesmers theory and to
 report upon it Under this order a commission was
10015 appointed and Benjamin Franklin was one of the com
 missioners This commission reported to the govern
 ment as follows

10018 In regard to the existence and utility of animal mag
 netism we have come to the unanimous conclusions that
 there is no proof of the existence of the animal magnetic
1011 fluid that the violent effects which are observed in
 the public practice of magnetism are due to manipula
1013 tions or to the excitement of the imagination and the
 impressions made upon the senses and that there is one
 more fact to be recorded in the history of the errors of
1016 the human mind and an important experiment upon
 the power of the imagination

 Clairvoyance magnetism

 In 1837 a committee of nine persons was appointed
1019 among whom were Roux Bouillaud and Clo
 quet which tested during several sessions the
 phenomena exhibited by a reputed clairvoyant Their
10112 report stated the results as follows

 The facts which had been promised by Monsieur
 Berna the magnetizer as conclusive and as adapted to
10115 throw light on physiological and therapeutical questions
 are certainly not conclusive in favor of the doctrine of
 animal magnetism and have nothing in common with
10118 either physiology or therapeutics

 This report was adopted by the Royal Academy of
 Medicine in Paris

 Personal conclusions

10121 The authors own observations of the workings of
 animal magnetism convince her that it is not
 a remedial agent and that its effects upon
10124 those who practise it and upon their subjects who do
 not resist it lead to moral and to physical death

 If animal magnetism seems to alleviate or to cure dis
10127 ease this appearance is deceptive since error cannot
 remove the effects of error Discomfort under error is
 preferable to comfort In no instance is the effect of
10130 animal magnetism recently called hypnotism other
 than the effect of illusion Any seeming benefit derived
 from it is proportional to ones faith in esoteric magic

 Mere negation

1021 Animal magnetism has no scientific foundation for
 God governs all that is real harmonious and eternal and
1023 His power is neither animal nor human Its
 basis being a belief and this belief animal in
 Science animal magnetism mesmerism or hypnotism is
1026 a mere negation possessing neither intelligence power
 nor reality and in sense it is an unreal concept of the so
 called mortal mind

1029 There is but one real attraction that of Spirit The
 pointing of the needle to the pole symbolizes this all
 embracing power or the attraction of God divine Mind

10212 The planets have no more power over man than over
 his Maker since God governs the universe but man
 reflecting Gods power has dominion over all the earth
10215 and its hosts

 Hidden agents

 The mild forms of animal magnetism are disappear
 ing and its aggressive features are coming to the front
10218 The looms of crime hidden in the dark re
 cesses of mortal thought are every hour weav
 ing webs more complicated and subtle So secret are the
10221 present methods of animal magnetism that they ensnare
 the age into indolence and produce the very apathy on
 the subject which the criminal desires The following
10224 is an extract from the Boston Herald

 Mesmerism is a problem not lending itself to an easy
 explanation and development It implies the exercise
10227 of despotic control and is much more likely to be abused
 by its possessor than otherwise employed for the in
 dividual or society

 Mental despotism

10230 Mankind must learn that evil is not power Its so
 called despotism is but a phase of nothingness Christian
 Science despoils the kingdom of evil and preeminently
1031 promotes affection and virtue in families and therefore
 in the community The Apostle Paul refers to the
1033 personification of evil as the god of this
 world and further defines it as dishonesty
 and craftiness Sin was the Assyrian moongod

 Liberation of mental powers

1036 The destruction of the claims of mortal mind through
 Science by which man can escape from sin
 and mortality blesses the whole human fam
1039 ily As in the beginning however this libera
 tion does not scientifically show itself in a knowledge of
 both good and evil for the latter is unreal
10312 On the other hand Mindscience is wholly separate
 from any halfway impertinent knowledge because Mind
 science is of God and demonstrates the divine Principle
10315 working out the purposes of good only The maximum
 of good is the infinite God and His idea the Allinall
 Evil is a suppositional lie

 The genus of error

10318 As named in Christian Science animal magnetism or
 hypnotism is the specific term for error or mortal mind
 It is the false belief that mind is in matter and
10321 is both evil and good that evil is as real as
 good and more powerful This belief has not one qual
 ity of Truth It is either ignorant or malicious The
10324 malicious form of hypnotism ultimates in moral idiocy
 The truths of immortal Mind sustain man and they anni
 hilate the fables of mortal mind whose flimsy and gaudy
10327 pretensions like silly moths singe their own wings and
 fall into dust

 Thoughttransference

 In reality there is no mortal mind and conse
10330 quently no transference of mortal thought
 and willpower Life and being are of
 God In Christian Science man can do no harm for
1041 scientific thoughts are true thoughts passing from God
 to man


1043 When Christian Science and animal magnetism are
 both comprehended as they will be at no distant date
 it will be seen why the author of this book has been
1046 so unjustly persecuted and belied by wolves in sheeps
 clothing

 Agassiz the celebrated naturalist and author has
1049 wisely said Every great scientific truth goes through
 three stages First people say it conflicts with the Bible
 Next they say it has been discovered before Lastly
10412 they say they have always believed it

 Perfection of divine government

 Christian Science goes to the bottom of mental action
 and reveals the theodicy which indicates the rightness of
10415 all divine action as the emanation of divine
 Mind and the consequent wrongness of the
 opposite socalled action  evil occultism
10418 necromancy mesmerism animal magnetism hypnotism

 Adulteration of Truth

 The medicine of Science is divine Mind and dishonesty
 sensuality falsehood revenge malice are animal pro
10421 pensities and by no means the mental quali
 ties which heal the sick The hypnotizer
 employs one error to destroy another If he heals sick
10424 ness through a belief and a belief originally caused the
 sickness it is a case of the greater error overcoming the
 lesser This greater error thereafter occupies the ground
10427 leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the
 stronger error

 Motives considered

 Our courts recognize evidence to prove the motive as
10430 well as the commission of a crime Is it not
 clear that the human mind must move the
 body to a wicked act Is not mortal mind the mur
1051 derer The hands without mortal mind to direct them
 could not commit a murder

 Mental crimes

1053 Courts and juries judge and sentence mortals in order
 to restrain crime to prevent deeds of violence or to punish
 them To say that these tribunals have no
1056 jurisdiction over the carnal or mortal mind
 would be to contradict precedent and to admit that the
 power of human law is restricted to matter while mortal
1059 mind evil which is the real outlaw defies justice and is
 recommended to mercy Can matter commit a crime
 Can matter be punished Can you separate the men
10512 tality from the body over which courts hold jurisdiction
 Mortal mind not matter is the criminal in every case
 and human law rightly estimates crime and courts rea
10515 sonably pass sentence according to the motive

 Important decision

 When our laws eventually take cognizance of mental
 crime and no longer apply legal rulings wholly to physical
10518 offences these words of Judge Parmenter of
 Boston will become historic I see no reason
 why metaphysics is not as important to medicine as to
10521 mechanics or mathematics

 Evil let loose

 Whoever uses his developed mental powers like an es
 caped felon to commit fresh atrocities as opportunity oc
10524 curs is never safe God will arrest him Di
 vine justice will manacle him His sins will
 be millstones about his neck weighing him down to the
10527 depths of ignominy and death The aggravation of er
 ror foretells its doom and confirms the ancient axiom
 Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad

 The misuse of mental power

10530 The distance from ordinary medical prac
 tice to Christian Science is full many a league
 in the line of light but to go in healing from the use of
1061 inanimate drugs to the criminal misuse of human will
 power is to drop from the platform of common manhood
1063 into the very mire of iniquity to work against the free
 course of honesty and justice and to push vainly against
 the current running heavenward

 Proper selfgovernment

1066 Like our nation Christian Science has its Declaration
 of Independence God has endowed man with inalien
 able rights among which are selfgovernment
1069 reason and conscience Man is properly self
 governed only when he is guided rightly and governed by
 his Maker divine Truth and Love

10612 Mans rights are invaded when the divine order is in
 terfered with and the mental trespasser incurs the divine
 penalty due this crime

 Right methods

10615 Let this age which sits in judgment on Christian
 Science sanction only such methods as are demonstrable
 in Truth and known by their fruit and classify
10618 all others as did St Paul in his great epistle
 to the Galatians when he wrote as follows

 Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are
10621 these Adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath
 strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness
10624 revellings and such like of the which I tell you before
 as I have also told you in time past that they which do
 such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God But
10627 the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
 gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against
 such there is no law




 CHAPTER VI  SCIENCE THEOLOGY MEDICINE

 But I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached
 of me is not after man For I neither received it of man neither
 was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ  PAUL

 The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman
 took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole
 was leavened  JESUS

 Christian Science discovered

1071 In the year 1866 I discovered the Christ Science or
 divine laws of Life Truth and Love and
1073 named my discovery Christian Science God
 had been graciously preparing me during many
 years for the reception of this final revelation of the ab
1076 solute divine Principle of scientific mental healing

 Mission of Christian Science

 This apodictical Principle points to the revelation of
 Immanuel God with us  the sovereign everpres
1079 ence delivering the children of men from
 every ill that flesh is heir to Through
 Christian Science religion and medicine are
10712 inspired with a diviner nature and essence fresh pinions
 are given to faith and understanding and thoughts ac
 quaint themselves intelligently with God

 Discontent with life

10715 Feeling so perpetually the false consciousness that life
 inheres in the body yet remembering that in
 reality God is our Life we may well tremble
10718 in the prospect of those days in which we must say I
 have no pleasure in them

1081 Whence came to me this heavenly conviction  a con
 viction antagonistic to the testimony of the physical senses
1083 According to St Paul it was the gift of the grace of
 God given unto me by the effectual working of His power
 It was the divine law of Life and Love unfolding to me
1086 the demonstrable fact that matter possesses neither sen
 sation nor life that human experiences show the falsity
 of all material things and that immortal cravings the
1089 price of learning love establish the truism that the
 only sufferer is mortal mind for the divine Mind cannot
 suffer

 Demonstrable evidence

10812 My conclusions were reached by allowing the evidence
 of this revelation to multiply with mathematical certainty
 and the lesser demonstration to prove the
10815 greater as the product of three multiplied by
 three equalling nine proves conclusively that three times
 three duodecillions must be nine duodecillions  not
10818 a fraction more not a unit less

 Light shining in darkness

 When apparently near the confines of mortal existence
 standing already within the shadow of the deathvalley
10821 I learned these truths in divine Science that
 all real being is in God the divine Mind and
 that Life Truth and Love are allpowerful and ever
10824 present that the opposite of Truth  called error sin
 sickness disease death  is the false testimony of false
 material sense of mind in matter that this false sense
10827 evolves in belief a subjective state of mortal mind which
 this same socalled mind names matter thereby shutting
 out the true sense of Spirit

 New lines of thought

10830 My discovery that erring mortal misnamed
 mind produces all the organism and action of
 the mortal body set my thoughts to work in new channels
1091 and led up to my demonstration of the proposition that
 Mind is All and matter is naught as the leading factor in
1093 Mindscience

 Scientific evidence

 Christian Science reveals incontrovertibly that Mind
 is Allinall that the only realities are the divine Mind
1096 and idea This great fact is not however seen
 to be supported by sensible evidence until its
 divine Principle is demonstrated by healing the sick and
1099 thus proved absolute and divine This proof once seen
 no other conclusion can be reached

 Solitary research

 For three years after my discovery I sought the solu
10912 tion of this problem of Mindhealing searched the Scrip
 tures and read little else kept aloof from so
 ciety and devoted time and energies to dis
10915 covering a positive rule The search was sweet calm and
 buoyant with hope not selfish nor depressing I knew
 the Principle of all harmonious Mindaction to be God
10918 and that cures were produced in primitive Christian
 healing by holy uplifting faith but I must know the
 Science of this healing and I won my way to absolute
10921 conclusions through divine revelation reason and dem
 onstration The revelation of Truth in the understand
 ing came to me gradually and apparently through divine
10924 power When a new spiritual idea is borne to earth the
 prophetic Scripture of Isaiah is renewedly fulfilled
 Unto us a child is born    and his name shall be
10927 called Wonderful

 Jesus once said of his lessons My doctrine is not
 mine but His that sent me If any man will do His will
10930 he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or
 whether I speak of myself John vii 1617

 Gods allness learned

 The three great verities of Spirit omnipotence omni
1101 presence omniscience  Spirit possessing all power
 filling all space constituting all Science  contradict
1103 forever the belief that matter can be actual
 These eternal verities reveal primeval exist
 ence as the radiant reality of Gods creation
1106 in which all that He has made is pronounced by His wis
 dom good

 Thus it was that I beheld as never before the awful
1109 unreality called evil The equipollence of God brought
 to light another glorious proposition  mans perfecti
 bility and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven on
11012 earth

 Scriptural foundations

 In following these leadings of scientific revelation
 the Bible was my only textbook The Scriptures were
11015 illumined reason and revelation were recon
 ciled and afterwards the truth of Christian
 Science was demonstrated No human pen nor tongue
11018 taught me the Science contained in this book SCIENCE
 AND HEALTH and neither tongue nor pen can over
 throw it This book may be distorted by shallow criti
11021 cism or by careless or malicious students and its ideas
 may be temporarily abused and misrepresented but the
 Science and truth therein will forever remain to be dis
11024 cerned and demonstrated

 The demonstration lost and found

 Jesus demonstrated the power of Christian Science to
 heal mortal minds and bodies But this power was lost
11027 sight of and must again be spiritually dis
 cerned taught and demonstrated according
 to Christs command with signs following
11030 Its Science must be apprehended by as many as believe
 on Christ and spiritually understand Truth

 Mystical antagonists

 No analogy exists between the vague hypotheses of
1111 agnosticism pantheism theosophy spiritualism or
 millenarianism and the demonstrable truths of Chris
1113 tian Science and I find the will or sensuous
 reason of the human mind to be opposed to
 the divine Mind as expressed through divine Science

 Optical illustration of Science

1116 Christian Science is natural but not physical The
 Science of God and man is no more supernatural than
 is the science of numbers though departing
1119 from the realm of the physical as the Science
 of God Spirit must some may deny its right to
 the name of Science The Principle of divine metaphysics
11112 is God the practice of divine metaphysics is the utiliza
 tion of the power of Truth over error its rules demon
 strate its Science Divine metaphysics reverses perverted
11115 and physical hypotheses as to Deity even as the ex
 planation of optics rejects the incidental or inverted
 image and shows what this inverted image is meant to
11118 represent

 Pertinent proposal

 A prize of one hundred pounds offered in Oxford Uni
 versity England for the best essay on Natural Science
11121  an essay calculated to offset the tendency of
 the age to attribute physical effects to physical
 causes rather than to a final spiritual cause  is one of
11124 many incidents which show that Christian Science meets
 a yearning of the human race for spirituality

 Confirmatory tests

 After a lengthy examination of my discovery and its
11127 demonstration in healing the sick this fact became evi
 dent to me  that Mind governs the body
 not partially but wholly I submitted my
11130 metaphysical system of treating disease to the broad
 est practical tests Since then this system has gradually
 gained ground and has proved itself whenever scien
1121 tifically employed to be the most effective curative agent
 in medical practice

 One school of Truth

1123 Is there more than one school of Christian Science
 Christian Science is demonstrable There can there
 fore be but one method in its teaching Those who de
1126 part from this method forfeit their claims to
 belong to its school and they become adher
 ents of the Socratic the Platonic the Spencerian or some
1129 other school By this is meant that they adopt and ad
 here to some particular system of human opinions Al
 though these opinions may have occasional gleams of
11212 divinity borrowed from that truly divine Science which
 eschews manmade systems they nevertheless remain
 wholly human in their origin and tendency and are not
11215 scientifically Christian

 Unchanging Principle

 From the infinite One in Christian Science comes one
 Principle and its infinite idea and with this infinitude
11218 come spiritual rules laws and their demon
 stration which like the great Giver are the
 same yesterday and today and forever for thus are
11221 the divine Principle of healing and the Christidea charac
 terized in the epistle to the Hebrews

 On sandy foundations

 Any theory of Christian Science which departs from
11224 what has already been stated and proved to be true af
 fords no foundation upon which to establish
 a genuine school of this Science Also if any
11227 socalled new school claims to be Christian Science and
 yet uses another authors discoveries without giving that
 author proper credit such a school is erroneous for it
11230 inculcates a breach of that divine commandment in the
 Hebrew Decalogue Thou shalt not steal

 Principle and practice

 God is the Principle of divine metaphysics As there
1131 is but one God there can be but one divine Principle of
 all Science and there must be fixed rules for the demon
1133 stration of this divine Principle The letter
 of Science plentifully reaches humanity today
 but its spirit comes only in small degrees The vital part
1136 the heart and soul of Christian Science is Love With
 out this the letter is but the dead body of Science 
 pulseless cold inanimate

 Reversible propositions

1139 The fundamental propositions of divine metaphysics
 are summarized in the four following to me selfevident
 propositions Even if reversed these proposi
11312 tions will be found to agree in statement and
 proof showing mathematically their exact relation to
 Truth De Quincey says mathematics has not a foot to
11315 stand upon which is not purely metaphysical

 1 God is Allinall
 2 God is good Good is Mind
11318 3 God Spirit being all nothing is matter
 4 Life God omnipotent good deny death evil sin
 disease  Disease sin evil death deny good omnipo
11321 tent God Life

 Which of the denials in proposition four is true Both
 are not cannot be true According to the Scripture
11324 I find that God is true but every mortal man a
 liar

 Metaphysical inversions

 The divine metaphysics of Christian Science like the
11327 method in mathematics proves the rule by inversion
 For example There is no pain in Truth and
 no truth in pain no nerve in Mind and no
11330 mind in nerve no matter in Mind and no mind in mat
 ter no matter in Life and no life in matter no matter
 in good and no good in matter

 Definition of mortal mind

1141 Usage classes both evil and good together as mind
 therefore to be understood the author calls sick and sin
1143 ful humanity mortal mind  meaning by this
 term the flesh opposed to Spirit the human
 mind and evil in contradistinction to the divine Mind or
1146 Truth and good The spiritually unscientific definition
 of mind is based on the evidence of the physical senses
 which makes minds many and calls mind both human and
1149 divine

 In Science Mind is one including noumenon and phe
 nomena God and His thoughts

 Imperfect terminology

11412 Mortal mind is a solecism in language and involves an
 improper use of the word mind As Mind is immortal
 the phrase mortal mind implies something un
11415 true and therefore unreal and as the phrase
 is used in teaching Christian Science it is meant to
 designate that which has no real existence Indeed if
11418 a better word or phrase could be suggested it would
 be used but in expressing the new tongue we must
 sometimes recur to the old and imperfect and the new
11421 wine of the Spirit has to be poured into the old bottles of
 the letter

 Causation mental

 Christian Science explains all cause and effect as men
11424 tal not physical It lifts the veil of mystery from Soul and
 body It shows the scientific relation of man
 to God disentangles the interlaced ambiguities
11427 of being and sets free the imprisoned thought In divine
 Science the universe including man is spiritual harmoni
 ous and eternal Science shows that what is termed mat
11430 ter is but the subjective state of what is termed by the
 author mortal mind

 Philological inadequacy

 Apart from the usual opposition to everything new
1151 the one great obstacle to the reception of that spiritual
 ity through which the understanding of Mindscience
1153 comes is the inadequacy of material terms for
 metaphysical statements and the consequent
 difficulty of so expressing metaphysical ideas as to make
1156 them comprehensible to any reader who has not person
 ally demonstrated Christian Science as brought forth in
 my discovery Job says The ear trieth words as the
1159 mouth tasteth meat The great difficulty is to give the
 right impression when translating material terms back
 into the original spiritual tongue

 SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF MORTAL MIND

 First Degree Depravity

 Unreality

11521 PHYSICAL Evil beliefs passions and appetites fear
 depraved will selfjustification pride envy de
 ceit hatred revenge sin sickness disease
11524 death

 Second Degree Evil beliefs disappearing

 Transitional qualities

 MORAL Humanity honesty affection com
 passion hope faith meekness temperance
1161 Third Degree Understanding

 Reality

 SPIRITUAL Wisdom purity spiritual understanding
1163 spiritual power love health holiness

 Spiritual universe

 In the third degree mortal mind disappears and man as
 Gods image appears Science so reverses the evidence
1166 before the corporeal human senses as to make
 this Scriptural testimony true in our hearts
 The last shall be first and the first last so that God
1169 and His idea may be to us what divinity really is and
 must of necessity be  allinclusive

 Aim of Science

 A correct view of Christian Science and of its adapta
11612 tion to healing includes vastly more than is at first seen
 Works on metaphysics leave the grand point
 untouched They never crown the power of
11615 Mind as the Messiah nor do they carry the day against
 physical enemies  even to the extinction of all belief in
 matter evil disease and death  nor insist upon the fact
11618 that God is all therefore that matter is nothing beyond an
 image in mortal mind

 Divine personality

 Christian Science strongly emphasizes the thought that
11621 God is not corporeal but incorporeal  that is
 bodiless Mortals are corporeal but God is
 incorporeal

11624 As the words person and personal are commonly and
 ignorantly employed they often lead when applied to
 Deity to confused and erroneous conceptions of divinity
11627 and its distinction from humanity If the term personality
 as applied to God means infinite personality then God is
 infinite Person  in the sense of infinite personality but
11630 not in the lower sense An infinite Mind in a finite form
 is an absolute impossibility

1171 The term individuality is also open to objections be
 cause an individual may be one of a series one of many
1173 as an individual man an individual horse whereas God
 is One  not one of a series but one alone and without
 an equal

 Spiritual language

1176 God is Spirit therefore the language of Spirit must
 be and is spiritual Christian Science attaches no physi
 cal nature and significance to the Supreme
1179 Being or His manifestation mortals alone do
 this Gods essential language is spoken of in the last
 chapter of Marks Gospel as the new tongue the spir
11712 itual meaning of which is attained through signs
 following

 The miracles of Jesus

 Ear hath not heard nor hath lip spoken the pure lan
11715 guage of Spirit Our Master taught spirituality by simili
 tudes and parables As a divine student he
 unfolded God to man illustrating and demon
11718 strating Life and Truth in himself and by his power over
 the sick and sinning Human theories are inadequate to
 interpret the divine Principle involved in the miracles
11721 marvels wrought by Jesus and especially in his mighty
 crowning unparalleled and triumphant exit from the
 flesh

 Opacity of the senses

11724 Evidence drawn from the five physical senses relates
 solely to human reason and because of opaci
 ty to the true light human reason dimly re
11727 flects and feebly transmits Jesus works and words Truth
 is a revelation

 Leaven of Truth

 Jesus bade his disciples beware of the leaven of the
11730 Pharisees and of the Sadducees which he de
 fined as human doctrines His parable of the
 leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures
1181 of meal till the whole was leavened impels the infer
 ence that the spiritual leaven signifies the Science of Christ
1183 and its spiritual interpretation  an inference far above
 the merely ecclesiastical and formal applications of the
 illustration
1186 Did not this parable point a moral with a prophecy
 foretelling the second appearing in the flesh of the
 Christ Truth hidden in sacred secrecy from the visi
1189 ble world

 Ages pass but this leaven of Truth is ever at work It
 must destroy the entire mass of error and so be eternally
11812 glorified in mans spiritual freedom

 The divine and human contrasted

 In their spiritual significance Science Theology and
 Medicine are means of divine thought which include spirit
11815 ual laws emanating from the invisible and in
 finite power and grace The parable may
 import that these spiritual laws perverted by
11818 a perverse material sense of law are metaphysically pre
 sented as three measures of meal  that is three modes
 of mortal thought In all mortal forms of thought dust
11821 is dignified as the natural status of men and things and
 modes of material motion are honored with the name of
 laws This continues until the leaven of Spirit changes
11824 the whole of mortal thought as yeast changes the chemical
 properties of meal

 Certain contradictions

 The definitions of material law as given by natural
11827 science represent a kingdom necessarily divided against
 itself because these definitions portray law as
 physical not spiritual Therefore they con
11830 tradict the divine decrees and violate the law of Love in
 which nature and God are one and the natural order of
 heaven comes down to earth

 Unescapable dilemma

1191 When we endow matter with vague spiritual power
 that is when we do so in our theories for of course we
1193 cannot really endow matter with what it does
 not and cannot possess  we disown the Al
 mighty for such theories lead to one of two things They
1196 either presuppose the selfevolution and selfgovernment
 of matter or else they assume that matter is the product
 of Spirit To seize the first horn of this dilemma and con
1199 sider matter as a power in and of itself is to leave the cre
 ator out of His own universe while to grasp the other
 horn of the dilemma and regard God as the creator of
11912 matter is not only to make Him responsible for all disas
 ters physical and moral but to announce Him as their
 source thereby making Him guilty of maintaining perpet
11915 ual misrule in the form and under the name of natural
 law

 God and nature

 In one sense God is identical with nature but this na
11918 ture is spiritual and is not expressed in matter The law
 giver whose lightning palsies or prostrates in
 death the child at prayer is not the divine ideal
11921 of omnipresent Love God is natural good and is repre
 sented only by the idea of goodness while evil should be
 regarded as unnatural because it is opposed to the nature
11924 of Spirit God

 The sun and Soul

 In viewing the sunrise one finds that it contradicts
 the evidence before the senses to believe that the earth
11927 is in motion and the sun at rest As astron
 omy reverses the human perception of the
 movement of the solar system so Christian Science re
11930 verses the seeming relation of Soul and body and makes
 body tributary to Mind Thus it is with man who
 is but the humble servant of the restful Mind though it
1201 seems otherwise to finite sense But we shall never under
 stand this while we admit that soul is in body or mind in
1203 matter and that man is included in nonintelligence
 Soul or Spirit is God unchangeable and eternal and
 man coexists with and reflects Soul God for man is Gods
1206 image

 Reversal of testimony

 Science reverses the false testimony of the physical
 senses and by this reversal mortals arrive at the funda
1209 mental facts of being Then the question in
 evitably arises Is a man sick if the material
 senses indicate that he is in good health No for matter
12012 can make no conditions for man And is he well if the
 senses say he is sick Yes he is well in Science in which
 health is normal and disease is abnormal

 Health and the senses

12015 Health is not a condition of matter but of Mind nor
 can the material senses bear reliable testimony on the sub
 ject of health The Science of Mindhealing
12018 shows it to be impossible for aught but Mind
 to testify truly or to exhibit the real status of man There
 fore the divine Principle of Science reversing the testi
12021 mony of the physical senses reveals man as harmoniously
 existent in Truth which is the only basis of health and
 thus Science denies all disease heals the sick overthrows
12024 false evidence and refutes materialistic logic

 Any conclusion pro or con deduced from supposed sen
 sation in matter or from matters supposed consciousness
12027 of health or disease instead of reversing the testimony of
 the physical senses confirms that testimony as legitimate
 and so leads to disease

 Historic illustrations

12030 When Columbus gave freer breath to the
 globe ignorance and superstition chained the
 limbs of the brave old navigator and disgrace and star
1211 vation stared him in the face but sterner still would have
 been his fate if his discovery had undermined the favor
1213 ite inclinations of a sensuous philosophy

 Copernicus mapped out the stellar system and before
 he spake astrography was chaotic and the heavenly fields
1216 were incorrectly explored

 Perennial beauty

 The Chaldean Wisemen read in the stars the fate of
 empires and the fortunes of men Though no higher
1219 revelation than the horoscope was to them dis
 played upon the empyrean earth and heaven
 were bright and bird and blossom were glad in Gods
12112 perennial and happy sunshine golden with Truth So
 we have goodness and beauty to gladden the heart but
 man left to the hypotheses of material sense unexplained
12115 by Science is as the wandering comet or the desolate
 star  a weary searcher for a viewless home

 Astronomic unfoldings

 The earths diurnal rotation is invisible to the physical
12118 eye and the sun seems to move from east to west instead
 of the earth from west to east Until rebuked
 by clearer views of the everlasting facts this
12121 false testimony of the eye deluded the judgment and in
 duced false conclusions Science shows appearances often
 to be erroneous and corrects these errors by the simple
12124 rule that the greater controls the lesser The sun is the
 central stillness so far as our solar system is concerned
 and the earth revolves about the sun once a year besides
12127 turning daily on its own axis

 As thus indicated astronomical order imitates the
 action of divine Principle and the universe the reflec
12130 tion of God is thus brought nearer the spiritual fact and
 is allied to divine Science as displayed in the everlasting
 government of the universe

 Opposing testimony

1221 The evidence of the physical senses often reverses the
 real Science of being and so creates a reign of discord 
1223 assigning seeming power to sin sickness and
 death but the great facts of Life rightly un
 derstood defeat this triad of errors contradict their false
1226 witnesses and reveal the kingdom of heaven  the actual
 reign of harmony on earth The material senses re
 versal of the Science of Soul was practically exposed nine
1229 teen hundred years ago by the demonstrations of Jesus
 yet these socalled senses still make mortal mind tributary
 to mortal body and ordain certain sections of matter such
12212 as brain and nerves as the seats of pain and pleasure
 from which matter reports to this socalled mind its status
 of happiness or misery

 Testimony of the senses

12215 The optical focus is another proof of the illusion of
 material sense On the eyes retina sky and treetops
 apparently join hands clouds and ocean meet
12218 and mingle The barometer  that little
 prophet of storm and sunshine denying the testimony of
 the senses  points to fair weather in the midst of murky
12221 clouds and drenching rain Experience is full of instances
 of similar illusions which every thinker can recall for
 himself

 Spiritual sense of life

12224 To material sense the severance of the jugular vein
 takes away life but to spiritual sense and
 in Science Life goes on unchanged and
12227 being is eternal Temporal life is a false sense of
 existence

 Ptolemaic and psychical error

 Our theories make the same mistake regarding Soul
12230 and body that Ptolemy made regarding the solar system
 They insist that soul is in body and mind therefore tribu
 tary to matter Astronomical science has destroyed the
1231 false theory as to the relations of the celestial bodies and
 Christian Science will surely destroy the greater error as
1233 to our terrestrial bodies The true idea and
 Principle of man will then appear The Ptole
 maic blunder could not affect the harmony of
1236 being as does the error relating to soul and body which
 reverses the order of Science and assigns to matter the
 power and prerogative of Spirit so that man becomes
1239 the most absolutely weak and inharmonious creature in
 the universe

 Seeming and being

 The verity of Mind shows conclusively how it is that
12312 matter seems to be but is not Divine Science
 rising above physical theories excludes matter
 resolves things into thoughts and replaces the objects of
12315 material sense with spiritual ideas

 The term CHRISTIAN SCIENCE was introduced by
 the author to designate the scientific system of divine
12318 healing

 The revelation consists of two parts

 1 The discovery of this divine Science of Mind
12321 healing through a spiritual sense of the Scriptures and
 through the teachings of the Comforter as promised by
 the Master
12324 2 The proof by present demonstration that the so
 called miracles of Jesus did not specially belong to a
 dispensation now ended but that they illustrated an
12327 everoperative divine Principle The operation of this
 Principle indicates the eternality of the scientific order
 and continuity of being

 Scientific basis

12330 Christian Science differs from material sci
 ence but not on that account is it less scien
 tific On the contrary Christian Science is preemi
1241 mently scientific being based on Truth the Principle of
 all science

 Physical science a blind belief

1243 Physical science socalled is human knowledge  a
 law of mortal mind a blind belief a Samson shorn of his
 strength When this human belief lacks organ
1246 izations to support it its foundations are gone
 Having neither moral might spiritual basis
 nor holy Principle of its own this belief mistakes effect
1249 for cause and seeks to find life and intelligence in matter
 thus limiting Life and holding fast to discord and death
 In a word human belief is a blind conclusion from material
12412 reasoning This is a mortal finite sense of things which
 immortal Spirit silences forever

 Right interpretation

 The universe like man is to be interpreted by Science
12415 from its divine Principle God and then it can be under
 stood but when explained on the basis of
 physical sense and represented as subject to
12418 growth maturity and decay the universe like man is
 and must continue to be an enigma

 All force mental

 Adhesion cohesion and attraction are properties of
12421 Mind They belong to divine Principle and support
 the equipoise of that thoughtforce which
 launched the earth in its orbit and said to the
12424 proud wave Thus far and no farther

 Spirit is the life substance and continuity of all
 things We tread on forces Withdraw them and
12427 creation must collapse Human knowledge calls them
 forces of matter but divine Science declares that they
 belong wholly to divine Mind are inherent in this
12430 Mind and so restores them to their rightful home and
 classification

 Corporeal changes

 The elements and functions of the physical body and
1251 of the physical world will change as mortal mind changes
 its beliefs What is now considered the best condition
1253 for organic and functional health in the human
 body may no longer be found indispensable
 to health Moral conditions will be found always har
1256 monious and healthgiving Neither organic inaction
 nor overaction is beyond Gods control and man will
 be found normal and natural to changed mortal thought
1259 and therefore more harmonious in his manifestations than
 he was in the prior states which human belief created and
 sanctioned

12512 As human thought changes from one stage to an
 other of conscious pain and painlessness sorrow and
 joy  from fear to hope and from faith to understand
12515 ing  the visible manifestation will at last be man gov
 erned by Soul not by material sense Reflecting Gods
 government man is selfgoverned When subordinate
12518 to the divine Spirit man cannot be controlled by sin or
 death thus proving our material theories about laws of
 health to be valueless

 The time and tide

12521 The seasons will come and go with changes of time and
 tide cold and heat latitude and longitude The agri
 culturist will find that these changes cannot
12524 affect his crops As a vesture shalt Thou
 change them and they shall be changed The mariner
 will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great
12527 deep over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air
 The astronomer will no longer look up to the stars 
 he will look out from them upon the universe and the
12530 florist will find his flower before its seed

 Mortal nothingness

 Thus matter will finally be proved nothing more
 than a mortal belief wholly inadequate to affect a man
1261 through its supposed organic action or supposed exist
 ence Error will be no longer used in stating truth The
1263 problem of nothingness or dust to dust will
 be solved and mortal mind will be without
 form and void for mortality will cease when man beholds
1266 himself Gods reflection even as man sees his reflection
 in a glass

 A lack of originality

 All Science is divine Human thought never pro
1269 jected the least portion of true being Human belief
 has sought and interpreted in its own way
 the echo of Spirit and so seems to have
12612 reversed it and repeated it materially but the human
 mind never produced a real tone nor sent forth a positive
 sound

 Antagonistic questions

12615 The point at issue between Christian Science on the
 one hand and popular theology on the other is this Shall
 Science explain cause and effect as being
12618 both natural and spiritual Or shall all that
 is beyond the cognizance of the material senses be called
 supernatural and be left to the mercy of speculative
12621 hypotheses

 Biblical basis

 I have set forth Christian Science and its application
 to the treatment of disease just as I have discovered them
12624 I have demonstrated through Mind the effects
 of Truth on the health longevity and morals
 of men and I have found nothing in ancient or in modern
12627 systems on which to found my own except the teachings
 and demonstrations of our great Master and the lives of
 prophets and apostles The Bible has been my only au
12630 thority I have had no other guide in the straight and
 narrow way of Truth

 Science and Christianity

 If Christendom resists the authors application of the
1271 word Science to Christianity or questions her use of the
 word Science she will not therefore lose faith in Chris
1273 tianity nor will Christianity lose its hold upon
 her If God the Allinall be the creator of
 the spiritual universe including man then everything
1276 entitled to a classification as truth or Science must be
 comprised in a knowledge or understanding of God for
 there can be nothing beyond illimitable divinity

 Scientific terms

1279 The terms Divine Science Spiritual Science Christ
 Science or Christian Science or Science alone she em
 ploys interchangeably according to the re
12712 quirements of the context These synony
 mous terms stand for everything relating to God the in
 finite supreme eternal Mind It may be said however
12715 that the term Christian Science relates especially to
 Science as applied to humanity Christian Science re
 veals God not as the author of sin sickness and death
12718 but as divine Principle Supreme Being Mind exempt
 from all evil It teaches that matter is the falsity not
 the fact of existence that nerves brain stomach lungs
12721 and so forth have  as matter  no intelligence life nor
 sensation

 No physical science

 There is no physical science inasmuch as all truth
12724 proceeds from the divine Mind Therefore truth is not
 human and is not a law of matter for matter
 is not a lawgiver Science is an emanation of
12727 divine Mind and is alone able to interpret God aright
 It has a spiritual and not a material origin It is a divine
 utterance  the Comforter which leadeth into all truth
12730 Christian Science eschews what is called natural science
 in so far as this is built on the false hypotheses that matter
 is its own lawgiver that law is founded on material con
1281 ditions and that these are final and overrule the might of
 divine Mind Good is natural and primitive It is not
1283 miraculous to itself

 Practical Science

 The term Science properly understood refers only to
 the laws of God and to His government of the universe
1286 inclusive of man From this it follows that
 business men and cultured scholars have found
 that Christian Science enhances their endurance and
1289 mental powers enlarges their perception of character
 gives them acuteness and comprehensiveness and an
 ability to exceed their ordinary capacity The human
12812 mind imbued with this spiritual understanding becomes
 more elastic is capable of greater endurance escapes
 somewhat from itself and requires less repose A knowl
12815 edge of the Science of being develops the latent abilities
 and possibilities of man It extends the atmosphere of
 thought giving mortals access to broader and higher
12818 realms It raises the thinker into his native air of insight
 and perspicacity

 An odor becomes beneficent and agreeable only in pro
12821 portion to its escape into the surrounding atmosphere
 So it is with our knowledge of Truth If one would
 not quarrel with his fellowman for waking him from
12824 a cataleptic nightmare he should not resist Truth which
 banishes  yea forever destroys with the higher testi
 mony of Spirit  the socalled evidence of matter

 Mathematics and scientific logic

12827 Science relates to Mind not matter It rests on fixed
 Principle and not upon the judgment of false sensation
 The addition of two sums in mathematics must
12830 always bring the same result So is it with
 logic If both the major and the minor propo
 sitions of a syllogism are correct the conclusion if properly
1291 drawn cannot be false So in Christian Science there
 are no discords nor contradictions because its logic is as
1293 harmonious as the reasoning of an accurately stated syl
 logism or of a properly computed sum in arithmetic
 Truth is ever truthful and can tolerate no error in
1296 premise or conclusion

 Truth by inversion

 If you wish to know the spiritual fact you can dis
 cover it by reversing the material fable be the
1299 fable pro or con  be it in accord with your
 preconceptions or utterly contrary to them

 Antagonistic theories

 Pantheism may be defined as a belief in the intelli
12912 gence of matter  a belief which Science overthrows
 In those days there will be great tribulation
 such as was not since the beginning of the
12915 world and earth will echo the cry Art thou Truth
 come hither to torment us before the time Animal
 magnetism hypnotism spiritualism theosophy agnos
12918 ticism pantheism and infidelity are antagonistic to true
 being and fatal to its demonstration and so are some
 other systems

 Ontology needed

12921 We must abandon pharmaceutics and take up ontol
 ogy  the science of real being We must look deep
 into realism instead of accepting only the out
12924 ward sense of things Can we gather peaches
 from a pinetree or learn from discord the concord of
 being Yet quite as rational are some of the leading
12927 illusions along the path which Science must tread in its
 reformatory mission among mortals The very name
 illusion points to nothingness

 Reluctant guests

12930 The generous liver may object to the authors small
 estimate of the pleasures of the table The sinner sees
 in the system taught in this book that the demands of
1301 God must be met The petty intellect is alarmed by con
 stant appeals to Mind The licentious disposition is dis
1303 couraged over its slight spiritual prospects
 When all men are bidden to the feast the ex
 cuses come One has a farm another has merchandise
1306 and therefore they cannot accept

 Excuses for ignorance

 It is vain to speak dishonestly of divine Science which
 destroys all discord when you can demonstrate
1309 the actuality of Science It is unwise to doubt
 if reality is in perfect harmony with God divine Principle
  if Science when understood and demonstrated will
13012 destroy all discord  since you admit that God is om
 nipotent for from this premise it follows that good and
 its sweet concords have allpower

 Children and adults

13015 Christian Science properly understood would dis
 abuse the human mind of material beliefs which war
 against spiritual facts and these material
13018 beliefs must be denied and cast out to make
 place for truth You cannot add to the contents of a
 vessel already full Laboring long to shake the adults
13021 faith in matter and to inculcate a grain of faith in God 
 an inkling of the ability of Spirit to make the body har
 monious  the author has often remembered our Masters
13024 love for little children and understood how truly such as
 they belong to the heavenly kingdom

 All evil unnatural

 If thought is startled at the strong claim of Science
13027 for the supremacy of God or Truth and doubts the su
 premacy of good ought we not contrari
 wise to be astounded at the vigorous claims
13030 of evil and doubt them and no longer think it natural to
 love sin and unnatural to forsake it  no longer imagine
 evil to be everpresent and good absent Truth should
1311 not seem so surprising and unnatural as error and error
 should not seem so real as truth Sickness should not seem
1313 so real as health There is no error in Science and our
 lives must be governed by reality in order to be in har
 mony with God the divine Principle of all being

 The error of carnality

1316 When once destroyed by divine Science the false evi
 dence before the corporeal senses disappears Hence the
 opposition of sensuous man to the Science of
1319 Soul and the significance of the Scripture The
 carnal mind is enmity against God The central fact of
 the Bible is the superiority of spiritual over physical power

13112 THEOLOGY

 Churchly neglect

 Must Christian Science come through the Christian
 churches as some persons insist This Science has come
13115 already after the manner of Gods appoint
 ing but the churches seem not ready to re
 ceive it according to the Scriptural saying He came
13118 unto his own and his own received him not Jesus once
 said I thank Thee O Father Lord of heaven and
 earth that Thou hast hid these things from the wise
13121 and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even
 so Father for so it seemed good in Thy sight As afore
 time the spirit of the Christ which taketh away the cere
13124 monies and doctrines of men is not accepted until the
 hearts of men are made ready for it

 John the Baptist and the Messiah

 The mission of Jesus confirmed prophecy and ex
13127 plained the socalled miracles of olden time as natural
 demonstrations of the divine power demonstra
 tions which were not understood Jesus works
13130 established his claim to the Messiahship In
 reply to Johns inquiry Art thou he that should come
1321 Jesus returned an affirmative reply recounting his works
 instead of referring to his doctrine confident that this
1323 exhibition of the divine power to heal would fully an
 swer the question Hence his reply Go and show
 John again those things which ye do hear and see the
1326 blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers
 are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them And
1329 blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me In
 other words he gave his benediction to any one who
 should not deny that such effects coming from divine
13212 Mind prove the unity of God  the divine principle
 which brings out all harmony

 Christ rejected

 The Pharisees of old thrust the spiritual idea and the
13215 man who lived it out of their synagogues and retained
 their materialistic beliefs about God Jesus
 system of healing received no aid nor approval
13218 from other sanitary or religious systems from doctrines
 of physics or of divinity and it has not yet been gener
 ally accepted Today as of yore unconscious of the
13221 reappearing of the spiritual idea blind belief shuts the
 door upon it and condemns the cure of the sick and sin
 ning if it is wrought on any but a material and a doctrinal
13224 theory Anticipating this rejection of idealism of the
 true idea of God  this salvation from all error physi
 cal and mental  Jesus asked When the Son of man
13227 cometh shall he find faith on the earth

 Johns misgivings

 Did the doctrines of John the Baptist confer healing
 power upon him or endow him with the truest concep
13230 tion of the Christ This righteous preacher
 once pointed his disciples to Jesus as the
 Lamb of God yet afterwards he seriously questioned
1331 the signs of the Messianic appearing and sent the inquiry
 to Jesus Art thou he that should come

 Faith according to works

1333 Was Johns faith greater than that of the Samaritan
 woman who said Is not this the Christ
 There was also a certain centurion of whose
1336 faith Jesus himself declared I have not found so great
 faith no not in Israel

 In Egypt it was Mind which saved the Israelites from
1339 belief in the plagues In the wilderness streams flowed
 from the rock and manna fell from the sky The Israelites
 looked upon the brazen serpent and straightway believed
13312 that they were healed of the poisonous stings of vipers
 In national prosperity miracles attended the successes of
 the Hebrews but when they departed from the true
13315 idea their demoralization began Even in captivity
 among foreign nations the divine Principle wrought
 wonders for the people of God in the fiery furnace and
13318 in kings palaces

 Judaism antipathetic

 Judaism was the antithesis of Christianity because
 Judaism engendered the limited form of a national or
13321 tribal religion It was a finite and material
 system carried out in special theories concern
 ing God man sanitary methods and a religious cultus
13324 That he made himself equal with God was one of the
 Jewish accusations against him who planted Christianity
 on the foundation of Spirit who taught as he was in
13327 spired by the Father and would recognize no life intelli
 gence nor substance outside of God

 Priestly learning

 The Jewish conception of God as Yawah Jehovah
13330 or only a mighty hero and king has not quite
 given place to the true knowledge of God
 Creeds and rituals have not cleansed their hands of
1341 rabbinical lore Today the cry of bygone ages is re
 peated Crucify him At every advancing step truth
1343 is still opposed with sword and spear

 Testimony of martyrs

 The word martyr from the Greek means witness but
 those who testified for Truth were so often persecuted
1346 unto death that at length the word martyr
 was narrowed in its significance and so has
 come always to mean one who suffers for his convictions
1349 The new faith in the Christ Truth so roused the hatred
 of the opponents of Christianity that the followers of
 Christ were burned crucified and otherwise persecuted
13412 and so it came about that human rights were hallowed
 by the gallows and the cross

 Absence of Christpower

 Manmade doctrines are waning They have not waxed
13415 strong in times of trouble Devoid of the Christpower
 how can they illustrate the doctrines of Christ
 or the miracles of grace Denial of the possi
13418 bility of Christian healing robs Christianity of the very
 element which gave it divine force and its astonishing and
 unequalled success in the first century

 Basis of miracles

13421 The true Logos is demonstrably Christian Science the
 natural law of harmony which overcomes discord  not
 because this Science is supernatural or pre
13424 ternatural nor because it is an infraction of
 divine law but because it is the immutable law of God
 good Jesus said I knew that Thou hearest me al
13427 ways and he raised Lazarus from the dead stilled the
 tempest healed the sick walked on the water There
 is divine authority for believing in the superiority of
13430 spiritual power over material resistance

 Lawful wonders

 A miracle fulfils Gods law but does not violate that
 law This fact at present seems more mysterious than
1351 the miracle itself The Psalmist sang What ailed
 thee O thou sea that thou fleddest Thou Jordan
1353 that thou wast driven back Ye mountains
 that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills
 like lambs Tremble thou earth at the presence of the
1356 Lord at the presence of the God of Jacob The miracle
 introduces no disorder but unfolds the primal order
 establishing the Science of Gods unchangeable law
1359 Spiritual evolution alone is worthy of the exercise of
 divine power

 Fear and sickness identical

 The same power which heals sin heals also sickness
13512 This is the beauty of holiness that when Truth heals
 the sick it casts out evils and when Truth
 casts out the evil called disease it heals the
13515 sick When Christ cast out the devil of
 dumbness it came to pass when the devil was gone out
 the dumb spake There is today danger of repeating
13518 the offence of the Jews by limiting the Holy One of Israel
 and asking Can God furnish a table in the wilderness
 What cannot God do

 The unity of Science and Christianity
13521 It has been said and truly that Christianity must be
 Science and Science must be Christianity else one or the
 other is false and useless but neither is unim
13524 portant or untrue and they are alike in demon
 stration This proves the one to be identical
 with the other Christianity as Jesus taught it was not
13527 a creed nor a system of ceremonies nor a special gift
 from a ritualistic Jehovah but it was the demonstration
 of divine Love casting out error and healing the sick
13530 not merely in the name of Christ or Truth but in demon
 stration of Truth as must be the case in the cycles of
 divine light

 The Christmission

1361 Jesus established his church and maintained his mission
 on a spiritual foundation of Christhealing He taught
1363 his followers that his religion had a divine
 Principle which would cast out error and heal
 both the sick and the sinning He claimed no intelli
1366 gence action nor life separate from God Despite the
 persecution this brought upon him he used his divine
 power to save men both bodily and spiritually

 Ancient spiritualism

1369 The question then as now was How did Jesus heal the
 sick His answer to this question the world rejected
 He appealed to his students Whom do
13612 men say that I the Son of man am That
 is Who or what is it that is thus identified with casting
 out evils and healing the sick They replied Some
13615 say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and
 others Jeremias or one of the prophets These prophets
 were considered dead and this reply may indicate that
13618 some of the people believed that Jesus was a medium
 controlled by the spirit of John or of Elias

 This ghostly fancy was repeated by Herod himself
13621 That a wicked king and debauched husband should have
 no high appreciation of divine Science and the great work
 of the Master was not surprising for how could such
13624 a sinner comprehend what the disciples did not fully
 understand But even Herod doubted if Jesus was con
 trolled by the sainted preacher Hence Herods asser
13627 tion John have I beheaded but who is this No
 wonder Herod desired to see the new Teacher

 Doubting disciples

 The disciples apprehended their Master better than
13630 did others but they did not comprehend all
 that he said and did or they would not have
 questioned him so often Jesus patiently persisted in
1371 teaching and demonstrating the truth of being His stu
 dents saw this power of Truth heal the sick cast out evil
1373 raise the dead but the ultimate of this wonderful work
 was not spiritually discerned even by them until after the
 crucifixion when their immaculate Teacher stood before
1376 them the victor over sickness sin disease death and
 the grave

 Yearning to be understood the Master repeated
1379 But whom say ye that I am This renewed inquiry
 meant Who or what is it that is able to do the work so
 mysterious to the popular mind In his rejection of the
13712 answer already given and his renewal of the question
 it is plain that Jesus completely eschewed the narrow
 opinion implied in their citation of the common report
13715 about him

 A divine response

 With his usual impetuosity Simon replied for his
 brethren and his reply set forth a great fact Thou
13718 art the Christ the Son of the living God
 That is The Messiah is what thou hast de
 clared  Christ the spirit of God of Truth Life and
13721 Love which heals mentally This assertion elicited from
 Jesus the benediction Blessed art thou Simon Bar
 jona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
13724 but my Father which is in heaven that is Love hath
 shown thee the way of Life

 The true and living rock

 Before this the impetuous disciple had been called
13727 only by his common names Simon Barjona or son of
 Jona but now the Master gave him a spir
 itual name in these words And I say also
13730 unto thee That thou art Peter and upon this rock the
 meaning of the Greek word petros or stone I will build
 my church and the gates of hell hades the under
1381 world or the grave shall not prevail against it In
 other words Jesus purposed founding his society not
1383 on the personal Peter as a mortal but on the God
 power which lay behind Peters confession of the true
 Messiah

 Sublime summary

1386 It was now evident to Peter that divine Life Truth and
 Love and not a human personality was the healer of the
 sick and a rock a firm foundation in the realm
1389 of harmony On this spiritually scientific basis
 Jesus explained his cures which appeared miraculous to
 outsiders He showed that diseases were cast out neither
13812 by corporeality by materia medica nor by hygiene but by
 the divine Spirit casting out the errors of mortal mind
 The supremacy of Spirit was the foundation on which
13815 Jesus built His sublime summary points to the religion
 of Love

 New era in Jesus

 Jesus established in the Christian era the precedent for
13818 all Christianity theology and healing Christians are
 under as direct orders now as they were then
 to be Christlike to possess the Christspirit to
13821 follow the Christexample and to heal the sick as well as
 the sinning It is easier for Christianity to cast out sick
 ness than sin for the sick are more willing to part with
13824 pain than are sinners to give up the sinful socalled pleas
 ure of the senses The Christian can prove this today as
 readily is it was proved centuries ago

 Healthful theology

13827 Our Master said to every follower Go ye into all the
 world and preach the gospel to every creature   
 Heal the sick    Love thy neighbor as
13830 thyself It was this theology of Jesus which
 healed the sick and the sinning It is his theology in this
 book and the spiritual meaning of this theology which
1391 heals the sick and causes the wicked to forsake his way
 and the unrighteous man his thoughts It was our Mas
1393 ters theology which the impious sought to destroy

 Marvels and reformations

 From beginning to end the Scriptures are full of
 accounts of the triumph of Spirit Mind over matter
1396 Moses proved the power of Mind by what men
 called miracles so did Joshua Elijah and
 Elisha The Christian era was ushered in with signs and
1399 wonders Reforms have commonly been attended with
 bloodshed and persecution even when the end has been
 brightness and peace but the present new yet old re
13912 form in religious faith will teach men patiently and wisely
 to stem the tide of sectarian bitterness whenever it flows
 inward

 Science obscured

13915 The decisions by vote of Church Councils as to what
 should and should not be considered Holy Writ the man
 ifest mistakes in the ancient versions the
13918 thirty thousand different readings in the Old
 Testament and the three hundred thousand in the New
  these facts show how a mortal and material sense stole
13921 into the divine record with its own hue darkening to some
 extent the inspired pages But mistakes could neither
 wholly obscure the divine Science of the Scriptures seen
13924 from Genesis to Revelation mar the demonstration of
 Jesus nor annul the healing by the prophets who foresaw
 that the stone which the builders rejected would be
13927 come the head of the corner

 Opponents benefited

 Atheism pantheism theosophy and agnosticism are
 opposed to Christian Science as they are to ordinary re
13930 ligion but it does not follow that the profane
 or atheistic invalid cannot be healed by Chris
 tian Science The moral condition of such a man de
1401 mands the remedy of Truth more than it is needed in most
 cases and Science is more than usually effectual in the
1403 treatment of moral ailments

 God invisible to the senses

 That God is a corporeal being nobody can truly affirm
 The Bible represents Him as saying Thou canst not
1406 see My face for there shall no man see Me
 and live Not materially but spiritually we
 know Him as divine Mind as Life Truth and Love We
1409 shall obey and adore in proportion as we apprehend the
 divine nature and love Him understandingly warring no
 more over the corporeality but rejoicing in the affluence
14012 of our God Religion will then be of the heart and not of
 the head Mankind will no longer be tyrannical and pro
 scriptive from lack of love  straining out gnats and
14015 swallowing camels

 The true worship

 We worship spiritually only as we cease to worship
 materially Spiritual devoutness is the soul of Chris
14018 tianity Worshipping through the medium of
 matter is paganism Judaic and other rituals
 are but types and shadows of true worship The true
14021 worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
 truth

 Anthropomorphism

 The Jewish tribal Jehovah was a manprojected God
14024 liable to wrath repentance and human changeableness
 The Christian Science God is universal eter
 nal divine love which changeth not and caus
14027 eth no evil disease nor death It is indeed mournfully
 true that the older Scripture is reversed In the begin
 ing God created man in His Gods image but mor
14030 tals would procreate man and make God in their own
 human image What is the god of a mortal but a mortal
 magnified

 More than profession required

1411 This indicates the distance between the theological and
 ritualistic religion of the ages and the truth preached by
1413 Jesus More than profession is requisite for
 Christian demonstration Few understand or
 adhere to Jesus divine precepts for living and
1416 healing Why Because his precepts require the disci
 ple to cut off the right hand and pluck out the right eye
  that is to set aside even the most cherished beliefs
1419 and practices to leave all for Christ

 No ecclesiastical monopoly

 All revelation such is the popular thought must come
 from the schools and along the line of scholarly and eccle
14112 siastical descent as kings are crowned from a
 royal dynasty In healing the sick and sinning
 Jesus elaborated the fact that the healing effect
14115 followed the understanding of the divine Principle and
 of the Christspirit which governed the corporeal Jesus
 For this Principle there is no dynasty no ecclesiastical
14118 monopoly Its only crowned head is immortal sover
 eignty Its only priest is the spiritualized man The
 Bible declares that all believers are made kings and
14121 priests unto God The outsiders did not then and
 do not now understand this ruling of the Christ there
 fore they cannot demonstrate Gods healing power
14124 Neither can this manifestation of Christ be com
 prehended until its divine Principle is scientifically
 understood

 A change demanded

14127 The adoption of scientific religion and of divine heal
 ing will ameliorate sin sickness and death Let our
 pulpits do justice to Christian Science Let
14130 it have fair representation by the press Give
 to it the place in our institutions of learning now occu
 pied by scholastic theology and physiology and it will
1421 eradicate sickness and sin in less time than the old systems
 devised for subduing them have required for selfestab
1423 lishment and propagation

 Two claims omitted

 Anciently the followers of Christ or Truth measured
 Christianity by its power over sickness sin and death
1426 but modern religions generally omit all but one
 of these powers  the power over sin We
 must seek the undivided garment the whole Christ as our
1429 first proof of Christianity for Christ Truth alone can
 furnish us with absolute evidence

 Selfishness and loss

 If the soft palm upturned to a lordly salary and archi
14212 tectural skill making dome and spire tremulous with
 beauty turn the poor and the stranger from the
 gate they at the same time shut the door on
14215 progress In vain do the manger and the cross tell their
 story to pride and fustian Sensuality palsies the right
 hand and causes the left to let go its grasp on the divine

 Temple cleansed

14218 As in Jesus time so today tyranny and pride need to
 be whipped out of the temple and humility and divine Sci
 ence to be welcomed in The strong cords of
14221 scientific demonstration as twisted and wielded
 by Jesus are still needed to purge the temples of their
 vain traffic in worldly worship and to make them meet
14224 dwellingplaces for the Most High

 MEDICINE

 Question of precedence

 Which was first Mind or medicine If Mind was
14227 first and selfexistent then Mind not matter must have
 been the first medicine God being Allin
 all He made medicine but that medicine was
14230 Mind It could not have been matter which departs
 from the nature and character of Mind God Truth
1431 is Gods remedy for error of every kind and Truth de
 stroys only what is untrue Hence the fact that today
1433 as yesterday Christ casts out evils and heals the
 sick

 Methods rejected

 It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene
1436 nor provide them for human use else Jesus would have
 recommended and employed them in his heal
 ing The sick are more deplorably lost than
1439 the sinning if the sick cannot rely on God for help and
 the sinning can The divine Mind never called matter
 medicine and matter required a material and human be
14312 lief before it could be considered as medicine

 Error not curative

 Sometimes the human mind uses one error to medi
 cine another Driven to choose between two difficulties
14315 the human mind takes the lesser to relieve the
 greater On this basis it saves from starva
 tion by theft and quiets pain with anodynes You
14318 admit that mind influences the body somewhat but
 you conclude that the stomach blood nerves bones
 etc hold the preponderance of power Controlled by
14321 this belief you continue in the old routine You lean on
 the inert and unintelligent never discerning how this de
 prives you of the available superiority of divine Mind
14324 The body is not controlled scientifically by a negative
 mind

 Impossible coalescence

 Mind is the grand creator and there can be no power
14327 except that which is derived from Mind If Mind was
 first chronologically is first potentially and
 must be first eternally then give to Mind the
14330 glory honor dominion and power everlastingly due its
 holy name Inferior and unspiritual methods of healing
 may try to make Mind and drugs coalesce but the two will
1441 not mingle scientifically Why should we wish to make
 them do so since no good can come of it
1443 If Mind is foremost and superior let us rely upon Mind
 which needs no cooperation from lower powers even if
 these socalled powers are real

1446 Naught is the squire when the king is nigh
 Withdraws the star when dawns the suns brave light

 Soul and sense

 The various mortal beliefs formulated in human philoso
1449 phy physiology hygiene are mainly predicated of matter
 and afford faint gleams of God or Truth
 The more material a belief the more obstinately
14412 tenacious its error the stronger are the manifestations of
 the corporeal senses the weaker the indications of Soul

 Willpower detrimental

 Human willpower is not Science Human will belongs
14415 to the socalled material senses and its use is to be con
 demned Willing the sick to recover is not the
 metaphysical practice of Christian Science but
14418 is sheer animal magnetism Human willpower may in
 fringe the rights of man It produces evil continually
 and is not a factor in the realism of being Truth and
14421 not corporeal will is the divine power which says to
 disease Peace be still

 Conservative antagonism

 Because divine Science wars with socalled physical
14424 science even as Truth wars with error the old schools
 still oppose it Ignorance pride or prejudice
 closes the door to whatever is not stereotyped
14427 When the Science of being is universally understood
 every man will be his own physician and Truth will be
 the universal panacea

 Ancient healers

14430 It is a question today whether the ancient inspired
 healers understood the Science of Christian healing or
1451 whether they caught its sweet tones as the natural
 musician catches the tones of harmony without being
1453 able to explain them So divinely imbued
 were they with the spirit of Science that the
 lack of the letter could not hinder their work and that
1456 letter without the spirit would have made void their
 practice

 The struggle and victory

 The struggle for the recovery of invalids goes on not
1459 between material methods but between mortal minds
 and immortal Mind The victory will be on
 the patients side only as immortal Mind
14512 through Christ Truth subdues the human belief in
 disease It matters not what material method one may
 adopt whether faith in drugs trust in hygiene or reliance
14515 on some other minor curative

 Mystery of godliness

 Scientific healing has this advantage over other meth
 ods  that in it Truth controls error From this fact
14518 arise its ethical as well as its physical ef
 fects Indeed its ethical and physical effects
 are indissolubly connected If there is any mystery
14521 in Christian healing it is the mystery which godliness
 always presents to the ungodly  the mystery always
 arising from ignorance of the laws of eternal and unerr
14524 ing Mind

 Matter versus matter

 Other methods undertake to oppose error with error
 and thus they increase the antagonism of one form of
14527 matter towards other forms of matter or error
 and the warfare between Spirit and the flesh
 goes on By this antagonism mortal mind must con
14530 tinually weaken its own assumed power

 How healing was lost

 The theology of Christian Science includes healing
 the sick Our Masters first article of faith propounded
1461 to his students was healing and he proved his faith by
 his works The ancient Christians were healers Why
1463 has this element of Christianity been lost
 Because our systems of religion are governed
 more or less by our systems of medicine The first idol
1466 atry was faith in matter The schools have rendered
 faith in drugs the fashion rather than faith in Deity By
 trusting matter to destroy its own discord health and
1469 harmony have been sacrificed Such systems are barren
 of the vitality of spiritual power by which material sense
 is made the servant of Science and religion becomes
14612 Christlike

 Drugs and divinity

 Material medicine substitutes drugs for the power of
 God  even the might of Mind  to heal the body
14615 Scholasticism clings for salvation to the per
 son instead of to the divine Principle of the
 man Jesus and his Science the curative agent of God
14618 is silenced Why Because truth divests material drugs
 of their imaginary power and clothes Spirit with suprem
 acy Science is the stranger that is within thy gates
14621 remembered not even when its elevating effects prac
 tically prove its divine origin and efficacy

 Christian Science as old as God

 Divine Science derives its sanction from the Bible
14624 and the divine origin of Science is demonstrated through
 the holy influence of Truth in healing sick
 ness and sin This healing power of Truth
14627 must have been far anterior to the period in
 which Jesus lived It is as ancient as the Ancient of
 days It lives through all Life and extends throughout
14630 all space

 Reduction to system

 Divine metaphysics is now reduced to a system to a
 form comprehensible by and adapted to the thought of
1471 the age in which we live This system enables the
 learner to demonstrate the divine Principle
1473 upon which Jesus healing was based and
 the sacred rules for its present application to the cure of
 disease

1476 Late in the nineteenth century I demonstrated the divine
 rules of Christian Science They were submitted to the
 broadest practical test and everywhere when honestly ap
1479 plied under circumstances where demonstration was hu
 manly possible this Science showed that Truth had lost
 none of its divine and healing efficacy even though cen
14712 turies had passed away since Jesus practised these rules
 on the hills of Judaea and in the valleys of Galilee

 Perusal and practice

 Although this volume contains the complete Science of
14715 Mindhealing never believe that you can absorb the whole
 meaning of the Science by a simple perusal
 of this book The book needs to be studied
14718 and the demonstration of the rules of scientific healing
 will plant you firmly on the spiritual groundwork of
 Christian Science This proof lifts you high above the
14721 perishing fossils of theories already antiquated and en
 ables you to grasp the spiritual facts of being hitherto
 unattained and seemingly dim

 A definite rule discovered

14724 Our Master healed the sick practised Christian heal
 ing and taught the generalities of its divine Principle to
 his students but he left no definite rule for
14727 demonstrating this Principle of healing and
 preventing disease This rule remained to be discovered
 in Christian Science A pure affection takes form in good
14730 ness but Science alone reveals the divine Principle of
 goodness and demonstrates its rules

 Jesus own practice

 Jesus never spoke of disease as dangerous or as difficult
1481 to heal When his students brought to him a case they
 had failed to heal he said to them O faithless gen
1483 eration implying that the requisite power
 to heal was in Mind He prescribed no drugs
 urged no obedience to material laws but acted in direct
1486 disobedience to them

 The man of anatomy and of theology

 Neither anatomy nor theology has ever described man
 as created by Spirit  as Gods man The former ex
1489 plains the men of men or the children of
 men as created corporeally instead of spir
 itually and as emerging from the lowest in
14812 stead of from the highest conception of being Both
 anatomy and theology define man as both physical and
 mental and place mind at the mercy of matter for every
14815 function formation and manifestation Anatomy takes
 up man at all points materially It loses Spirit drops the
 true tone and accepts the discord Anatomy and the
14818 ology reject the divine Principle which produces harmo
 nious man and deal  the one wholly the other primarily
  with matter calling that man which is not the counter
14821 part but the counterfeit of Gods man Then theology
 tries to explain how to make this man a Christian  how
 from this basis of division and discord to produce the con
14824 cord and unity of Spirit and His likeness

 Physiology deficient

 Physiology exalts matter dethrones Mind and claims
 to rule man by material law instead of spiritual When
14827 physiology fails to give health or life by this
 process it ignores the divine Spirit as unable
 or unwilling to render help in time of physical need
14830 When mortals sin this ruling of the schools leaves them
 to the guidance of a theology which admits God to be
 the healer of sin but not of sickness although our great
1491 Master demonstrated that Truth could save from sickness
 as well as from sin

 Blunders and blunderers

1493 Mind as far outweighs drugs in the cure of disease as
 in the cure of sin The more excellent way is divine
 Science in every case Is materia medica a
1496 science or a bundle of speculative human
 theories The prescription which succeeds in one in
 stance fails in another and this is owing to the different
1499 mental states of the patient These states are not com
 prehended and they are left without explanation except
 in Christian Science The rule and its perfection of opera
14912 tion never vary in Science If you fail to succeed in any
 case it is because you have not demonstrated the life of
 Christ Truth more in your own life  because you have
14915 not obeyed the rule and proved the Principle of divine
 Science

 Oldschool physician

 A physician of the old school remarked with great
14918 gravity We know that mind affects the body some
 what and advise our patients to be hopeful
 and cheerful and to take as little medicine as
14921 possible but mind can never cure organic difficulties
 The logic is lame and facts contradict it The author
 has cured what is termed organic disease as readily as she
14924 has cured purely functional disease and with no power
 but the divine Mind

 Tests in our day

 Since God divine Mind governs all not partially but
14927 supremely predicting disease does not dignify therapeutics
 Whatever guides thought spiritually benefits
 mind and body We need to understand the
14930 affirmations of divine Science dismiss superstition and
 demonstrate truth according to Christ Today there
 is hardly a city village or hamlet in which are not to
1501 be found living witnesses and monuments to the virtue
 and power of Truth as applied through this Christian
1503 system of healing disease

 The main purpose

 Today the healing power of Truth is widely demon
 strated as an immanent eternal Science instead of a
1506 phenomenal exhibition Its appearing is the
 coming anew of the gospel of on earth peace
 goodwill toward men This coming as was promised
1509 by the Master is for its establishment as a permanent
 dispensation among men but the mission of Christian
 Science now as in the time of its earlier demonstration
15012 is not primarily one of physical healing Now as then
 signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical heal
 ing of physical disease but these signs are only to demon
15015 strate its divine origin  to attest the reality of the higher
 mission of the Christpower to take away the sins of the
 world

 Exploded doctrine

15018 The science socalled of physics would have one be
 lieve that both matter and mind are subject to disease
 and that too in spite of the individuals pro
15021 test and contrary to the law of divine Mind
 This human view infringes mans free moral agency and
 it is as evidently erroneous to the author and will be to
15024 all others at some future day as the practically rejected
 doctrine of the predestination of souls to damnation or
 salvation The doctrine that mans harmony is gov
15027 erned by physical conditions all his earthly days and that
 he is then thrust out of his own body by the operation of
 matter  even the doctrine of the superiority of matter
15030 over Mind  is fading out

 Disease mental

 The hosts of AEsculapius are flooding the world with
 diseases because they are ignorant that the human mind
1511 and body are myths To be sure they sometimes treat
 the sick as if there was but one factor in the case but
1513 this one factor they represent to be body not
 mind Infinite Mind could not possibly create
 a remedy outside of itself but erring finite human mind
1516 has an absolute need of something beyond itself for its
 redemption and healing

 Intentions respected

 Great respect is due the motives and philanthropy of
1519 the higher class of physicians We know that if they un
 derstood the Science of Mindhealing and were
 in possession of the enlarged power it confers
15112 to benefit the race physically and spiritually they would
 rejoice with us Even this one reform in medicine would
 ultimately deliver mankind from the awful and oppres
15115 sive bondage now enforced by false theories from which
 multitudes would gladly escape

 Man governed by Mind

 Mortal belief says that death has been occasioned by
15118 fright Fear never stopped being and its action The
 blood heart lungs brain etc have nothing
 to do with Life God Every function of the
15121 real man is governed by the divine Mind The human
 mind has no power to kill or to cure and it has no com
 trol over Gods man The divine Mind that made man
15124 maintain His own image and likeness The human
 mind is opposed to God and must be put off as St Paul
 declares All that really exists is the divine Mind and
15127 its idea and in this Mind the entire being is found har
 monious and eternal The straight and narrow way is to
 see and acknowledge this fact yield to this power and
15130 follow the leadings of truth

 Mortal mind dethroned

 That mortal mind claims to govern every organ of the
 mortal body we have overwhelming proof But this so
1521 called mind is a myth and must by its own consent yield
 to Truth It would wield the sceptre of a monarch but
1523 it is powerless The immortal divine Mind
 takes away all its supposed sovereignty and
 saves mortal mind from itself The author has endeavored
1526 to make this book the AEsculapius of mind as well as of
 body that it may give hope to the sick and heal them
 although they know not how the work is done Truth
1529 has a healing effect even when not fully understood

 All activity from thought

 Anatomy describes muscular action as produced by
 mind in one instance and not in another Such errors
15212 beset every material theory in which one
 statement contradicts another over and over
 again It is related that Sir Humphry Davy once ap
15215 parently cured a case of paralysis simply by introducing
 a thermometer into the patients mouth This he did
 merely to ascertain the temperature of the patients body
15218 but the sick man supposed this ceremony was intended
 to heal him and he recovered accordingly Such a fact
 illustrates our theories

 The authors experiments in medicine

15221 The authors medical researches and experiments had
 prepared her thought for the metaphysics of Christian
 Science Every material dependence had
15224 failed her in her search for truth and she can
 now understand why and can see the means
 by which mortals are divinely driven to a spiritual source
15227 for health and happiness

 Homoeopathic attenuations

 Her experiments in homoeopathy had made her skep
 tical as to material curative methods Jahr from
15230 Aconitum to Zincum oxydatum enumerates
 the general symptoms the characteristic
 signs which demand different remedies but the drug
1531 is frequently attenuated to such a degree that not a ves
 tige of it remains Thus we learn that it is not the drug
1533 which expels the disease or changes one of the symptoms
 of disease

 Only salt and water

 The author has attenuated Natrum muriaticum com
1536 mon tablesalt until there was not a single saline property
 left The salt had lost his savour and yet
 with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of
1539 water and a teaspoonful of the water administered at in
 tervals of three hours she has cured a patient sinking in
 the last stage of typhoid fever The highest attenuation
15312 of homoeopathy and the most potent rises above matter into
 mind This discovery leads to more light From it may
 be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is
15315 the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug

 Origin of pain

 You say a boil is painful but that is impossible for
 matter without mind is not painful The boil simply
15318 manifests through inflammation and swell
 ing a belief in pain and this belief is called a
 boil Now administer mentally to your patient a high
15321 attenuation of truth and it will soon cure the boil The
 fact that pain cannot exist where there is no mortal mind
 to feel it is a proof that this socalled mind makes its
15324 own pain  that is its own belief in pain

 Source of contagion

 We weep because others weep we yawn because they
 yawn and we have smallpox because others have it but
15327 mortal mind not matter contains and carries
 the infection When this mental contagion is
 understood we shall be more careful of our mental con
15330 ditions and we shall avoid loquacious tattling about
 disease as we would avoid advocating crime Neither
 sympathy nor society should ever tempt us to cherish
1541 error in any form and certainly we should not be errors
 advocate
1543 Disease arises like other mental conditions from as
 sociation Since it is a law of mortal mind that certain
 diseases should be regarded as contagious this law ob
1546 tains credit through association  calling up the fear that
 creates the image of disease and its consequent manifes
 tation in the body

 Imaginary cholera

1549 This fact in metaphysics is illustrated by the following
 incident A man was made to believe that he occupied a
 bed where a cholera patient had died Imme
15412 diately the symptoms of this disease appeared
 and the man died The fact was that he had not caught
 the cholera by material contact because no cholera patient
15415 had been in that bed

 Childrens ailments

 If a child is exposed to contagion or infection the
 mother is frightened and says My child will be sick
15418 The law of mortal mind and her own fears gov
 ern her child more than the childs mind gov
 erns itself and they produce the very results which might
15421 have been prevented through the opposite understanding
 Then it is believed that exposure to the contagion wrought
 the mischief

15424 That mother is not a Christian Scientist and her affec
 tions need better guidance who says to her child You
 look sick You look tired You need rest or You
15427 need medicine

 Such a mother runs to her little one who thinks she has
 hurt her face by falling on the carpet and says moaning
15430 more childishly than her child Mamma knows you are
 hurt The better and more successful method for any
 mother to adopt is to say Oh never mind Youre not
1551 hurt so dont think you are Presently the child forgets
 all about the accident and is at play

 Drugpower mental

1553 When the sick recover by the use of drugs it is the law
 of a general belief culminating in individual faith which
 heals and according to this faith will the effect
1556 be Even when you take away the individual
 confidence in the drug you have not yet divorced the drug
 from the general faith The chemist the botanist the
1559 druggist the doctor and the nurse equip the medicine
 with their faith and the beliefs which are in the majority
 rule When the general belief endorses the inanimate
15512 drug as doing this or that individual dissent or faith un
 less it rests on Science is but a belief held by a minority
 and such a belief is governed by the majority

 Belief in physics

15515 The universal belief in physics weighs against the high
 and mighty truths of Christian metaphysics This errone
 ous general belief which sustains medicine and
15518 produces all medical results works against
 Christian Science and the percentage of power on the
 side of this Science must mightily outweigh the power of
15521 popular belief in order to heal a single case of disease The
 human mind acts more powerfully to offset the discords
 of matter and the ills of flesh in proportion as it puts less
15524 weight into the material or fleshly scale and more weight
 into the spiritual scale Homoeopathy diminishes the
 drug but the potency of the medicine increases as the
15527 drug disappears

 Nature of drugs

 Vegetarianism homoeopathy and hydropathy have
 diminished drugging but if drugs are an antidote to
15530 disease why lessen the antidote If drugs
 are good things is it safe to say that the
 less in quantity you have of them the better If drugs
1561 possess intrinsic virtues or intelligent curative qualities
 these qualities must be mental Who named drugs and
1563 what made them good or bad for mortals beneficial or
 injurious

 Dropsy cured without drugs

 A case of dropsy given up by the faculty fell into
1566 my hands It was a terrible case Tapping had been
 employed and yet as she lay in her bed the
 patient looked like a barrel I prescribed
1569 the fourth attenuation of Argentum nitratum with occa
 sional doses of a high attenuation of Sulphuris She im
 proved perceptibly Believing then somewhat in the
15612 ordinary theories of medical practice and learning that
 her former physician had prescribed these remedies I
 began to fear an aggravation of symptoms from their
15615 prolonged use and told the patient so but she was
 unwilling to give up the medicine while she was re
 covering It then occurred to me to give her un
15618 medicated pellets and watch the result I did so and
 she continued to gain Finally she said that she would
 give up her medicine for one day and risk the
15621 effects After trying this she informed me that she
 could get along two days without globules but on
 the third day she again suffered and was relieved by
15624 taking them She went on in this way taking the
 unmedicated pellets  and receiving occasional visits
 from me  but employing no other means and she was
15627 cured

 A stately advance

 Metaphysics as taught in Christian Science is the
 next stately step beyond homoeopathy In metaphysics
15630 matter disappears from the remedy entirely
 and Mind takes its rightful and supreme
 place Homoeopathy takes mental symptoms largely
1571 into consideration in its diagnosis of disease Christian
 Science deals wholly with the mental cause in judging and
1573 destroying disease It succeeds where homoeopathy fails
 solely because its one recognized Principle of healing is
 Mind and the whole force of the mental element is em
1576 ployed through the Science of Mind which never shares
 its rights with inanimate matter

 The modus of homoeopathy

 Christian Science exterminates the drug and rests on
1579 Mind alone as the curative Principle acknowledging that
 the divine Mind has all power Homoeopathy
 mentalizes a drug with such repetition of
15712 thoughtattenuations that the drug becomes
 more like the human mind than the substratum of this so
 called mind which we call matter and the drugs power
15715 of action is proportionately increased

 Drugging unchristian

 If drugs are part of Gods creation which according
 to the narrative in Genesis He pronounced good then
15718 drugs cannot be poisonous If He could cre
 ate drugs intrinsically bad then they should
 never be used If He creates drugs at all and designs
15721 them for medical use why did Jesus not employ them
 and recommend them for the treatment of disease
 Matter is not selfcreative for it is unintelligent Erring
15724 mortal mind confers the power which the drug seems to
 possess

 Narcotics quiet mortal mind and so relieve the body
15727 but they leave both mind and body worse for this sub
 mission Christian Science impresses the entire corpore
 ality  namely mind and body  and brings out the
15730 proof that Life is continuous and harmonious Science
 both neutralizes error and destroys it Mankind is the
 better for this spiritual and profound pathology

 Mythology and materia medica

1581 It is recorded that the profession of medicine originated
 in idolatry with pagan priests who besought the gods to
1583 heal the sick and designated Apollo as the god
 of medicine He was supposed to have dic
 tated the first prescription according to the
1586 History of Four Thousand Years of Medicine It is
 here noticeable that Apollo was also regarded as the sender
 of disease the god of pestilence Hippocrates turned
1589 from imagegods to vegetable and mineral drugs for heal
 ing This was deemed progress in medicine but
 what we need is the truth which heals both mind and
15812 body The future history of material medicine may
 correspond with that of its material god Apollo who was
 banished from heaven and endured great sufferings
15815 upon earth

 Footsteps to intemperance

 Drugs cataplasms and whiskey are stupid substitutes
 for the dignity and potency of divine Mind and its effi
15818 cacy to heal It is pitiful to lead men into
 temptation through the byways of this wil
 derness world  to victimize the race with intoxicating
15821 prescriptions for the sick until mortal mind acquires an
 educated appetite for strong drink and men and women
 become loathsome sots

 Advancing degrees

15824 Evidences of progress and of spiritualization greet us
 on every hand Drugsystems are quitting their hold on
 matter and so letting in matters higher stra
15827 tum mortal mind Homoeopathy a step in
 advance of allopathy is doing this Matter is going out
 of medicine and mortal mind of a higher attenuation
15830 than the drug is governing the pellet

 Effects of fear

 A woman in the city of Lynn Massachusetts was
 etherized and died in consequence although her physi
1591 cians insisted that it would be unsafe to perform a needed
 surgical operation without the ether After the autopsy
1593 her sister testified that the deceased protested
 against inhaling the ether and said it would kill
 her but that she was compelled by her physicians to take
1596 it Her hands were held and she was forced into sub
 mission The case was brought to trial The evidence
 was found to be conclusive and a verdict was returned that
1599 death was occasioned not by the ether but by fear of
 inhaling it

 Mental conditions to be heeded

 Is it skilful or scientific surgery to take no heed of men
15912 tal conditions and to treat the patient as if she were so
 much mindless matter and as if matter were
 the only factor to be consulted Had these
15915 unscientific surgeons understood metaphysics
 they would have considered the womans state of mind
 and not have risked such treatment They would either
15918 have allayed her fear or would have performed the opera
 tion without ether

 The sequel proved that this Lynn woman died from
15921 effects produced by mortal mind and not from the disease
 or the operation

 False source of knowledge

 The medical schools would learn the state of man
15924 from matter instead of from Mind They examine the
 lungs tongue and pulse to ascertain how
 much harmony or health matter is permit
15927 ting to matter  how much pain or pleasure action or
 stagnation one form of matter is allowing another form
 of matter

15930 Ignorant of the fact that a mans belief produces dis
 ease and all its symptoms the ordinary physician is
 liable to increase disease with his own mind when he
1601 should address himself to the work of destroying it through
 the power of the divine Mind

1603 The systems of physics act against metaphysics and
 vice versa When mortals forsake the material for the
 spiritual basis of action drugs lose their healing force
1606 for they have no innate power Unsupported by the
 faith reposed in it the inanimate drug becomes
 powerless

 Obedient muscles

1609 The motion of the arm is no more dependent upon the
 direction of mortal mind than are the organic action and
 secretion of the viscera When this socalled
16012 mind quits the body the heart becomes as tor
 pid as the hand

 Anatomy and mind

 Anatomy finds a necessity for nerves to convey the man
16015 date of mind to muscle and so cause action but what does
 anatomy say when the cords contract and be
 come immovable Has mortal mind ceased
16018 speaking to them or has it bidden them to be impotent
 Can muscles bones blood and nerves rebel against mind
 in one instance and not in another and become cramped
16021 despite the mental protest

 Unless muscles are selfacting at all times they are
 never so  never capable of acting contrary to mental
16024 direction If muscles can cease to act and become rigid
 of their own preference  be deformed or symmetrical
 as they please or as disease directs  they must be self
16027 directing Why then consult anatomy to learn how mor
 tal mind governs muscle if we are only to learn from
 anatomy that muscle is not so governed

 Mind over matter

16030 Is man a material fungus without Mind
 to help him Is a stiff joint or a contracted
 muscle as much a result of law as the supple and
1611 elastic condition of the healthy limb and is God the
 lawgiver

1613 You say I have burned my finger This is an
 exact statement more exact than you suppose for mor
 tal mind and not matter burns it Holy inspiration
1616 has created states of mind which have been able to nullify
 the action of the flames as in the Bible case of the three
 young Hebrew captives cast into the Babylonian furnace
1619 while an opposite mental state might produce spontaneous
 combustion

 Restrictive regulations

 In 1880 Massachusetts put her foot on a proposed
16112 tyrannical law restricting the practice of medicine If
 her sister States follow this example in har
 mony with our Constitution and Bill of Rights
16115 they will do less violence to that immortal sentiment of the
 Declaration Man is endowed by his Maker with certain
 inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the
16118 pursuit of happiness

 The oppressive state statutes touching medicine re
 mind one of the words of the famous Madame Roland
16121 as she knelt before a statue of Liberty erected near the
 guillotine Liberty what crimes are committed in thy
 name

 Metaphysics challenges physics

16124 The ordinary practitioner examining bodily symptoms
 telling the patient that he is sick and treating the case ac
 cording to his physical diagnosis would natu
16127 rally induce the very disease he is trying to cure
 even if it were not already determined by mor
 tal mind Such unconscious mistakes would not occur if
16130 this old class of philanthropists looked as deeply for cause
 and effect into mind as into matter The physician agrees
 with his adversary quickly but upon different terms
1621 than does the metaphysician for the matterphysician
 agrees with the disease while the metaphysician agrees
1623 only with health and challenges disease

 Truth an alterative

 Christian Science brings to the body the sunlight of
 Truth which invigorates and purifies Christian Science
1626 acts as an alterative neutralizing error with
 Truth It changes the secretions expels hu
 mors dissolves tumors relaxes rigid muscles restores
1629 carious bones to soundness The effect of this Science is
 to stir the human mind to a change of base on which it
 may yield to the harmony of the divine Mind

 Practical success

16212 Experiments have favored the fact that Mind governs
 the body not in one instance but in every instance The
 indestructible faculties of Spirit exist without
16215 the conditions of matter and also without the
 false beliefs of a socalled material existence Working
 out the rules of Science in practice the author has re
16218 stored health in cases of both acute and chronic disease in
 their severest forms Secretions have been changed the
 structure has been renewed shortened limbs have been
16221 elongated ankylosed joints have been made supple and
 carious bones have been restored to healthy conditions I
 have restored what is called the lost substance of lungs and
16224 healthy organizations have been established where disease
 was organic Christian Science heals organic disease as
 surely as it heals what is called functional for it requires
16227 only a fuller understanding of the divine Principle of
 Christian Science to demonstrate the higher rule

 Testimony of medical teachers

 With due respect for the faculty I kindly
16230 quote from Dr Benjamin Rush the famous
 Philadelphia teacher of medical practice He
 declared that it is impossible to calculate the mischief
1631 which Hippocrates has done by first marking Nature
 with his name and afterward letting her loose upon sick
1633 people

 Dr Benjamin Waterhouse Professor in Harvard Uni
 versity declared himself sick of learned quackery

1636 Dr James Johnson Surgeon to William IV King Of
 England said

 I declare my conscientious opinion founded on long
1639 observation and reflection that if there were not a single
 physician surgeon apothecary manmidwife chemist
 druggist or drug on the face of the earth there would be
16312 less sickness and less mortality

 Dr Mason Good a learned Professor in London
 said

16315 The effects of medicine on the human system are in
 the highest degree uncertain except indeed that it has
 already destroyed more lives than war pestilence and
16318 famine all combined

 Dr Chapman Professor of the Institutes and Practice
 of Physic in the University of Pennsylvania in a published
16321 essay said

 Consulting the records of our science we cannot
 help being disgusted with the multitude of hypotheses
16324 obtruded upon us at different times Nowhere is the
 imagination displayed to a greater extent and perhaps
 so ample an exhibition of human invention might gratify
16327 our vanity if it were not more than compensated by the
 humiliating view of so much absurdity contradiction
 and falsehood To harmonize the contrarieties of med
16330 ical doctrines is indeed a task as impractible as to
 arrange the fleeting vapors around us or to reconcile the
 fixed and repulsive antipathies of nature Dark and
1641 perplexed our devious career resembles the groping of
 Homers Cyclops around his cave

1643 Sir John Forbes MD FRS Fellow of the Royal
 College of Physicians London said

 No systematic or theoretical classification of diseases
1646 or of therapeutic agents ever yet promulgated is true or
 anything like the truth and none can be adopted as a safe
 guidance in practice

1649 It is just to say that generally the cultured class of medi
 cal practitioners are grand men and women therefore
 they are more scientific than are false claimants to Chris
16412 tian Science But all human systems based on material
 premises are minus the unction of divine Science Much
 yet remains to be said and done before all mankind is
16415 saved and all the mental microbes of sin and all diseased
 thoughtgerms are exterminated

 If you or I should appear to die we should not be
16418 dead The seeming decease caused by a majority of
 human beliefs that man must die or produced by mental
 assassins does not in the least disprove Christian Science
16421 rather does it evidence the truth of its basic proposition
 that mortal thoughts in belief rule the materiality mis
 called life in the body or in matter But the forever fact
16424 remains paramount that Life Truth and Love save from
 sin disease and death When this corruptible shall have
 put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on
16427 immortality divine Science then shall be brought to pass
 the saying that is written Death is swallowed up in
 victory St Paul




 CHAPTER VII  PHYSIOLOGY

 Therefore I say unto you Take no thought for your life what
 ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body
 what ye shall put on
 Is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment  JESUS

 He sent His word and healed them and delivered them from their
 destructions  PSALMS

1651 PHYSIOLOGY is one of the apples from the tree
 of knowledge Evil declared that eating this fruit
1653 would open mans eyes and make him as a god Instead
 of so doing it closed the eyes of mortals to mans God
 given dominion over the earth

 Man not structural

1656 To measure intellectual capacity by the size of the
 brain and strength by the exercise of muscle is to
 subjugate intelligence to make mind mor
1659 tal and to place this socalled mind at the
 mercy of material organization and nonintelligent
 matter

16512 Obedience to the socalled physical laws of health has
 not checked sickness Diseases have multiplied since
 manmade material theories took the place of spiritual
16515 truth

 Causes of sickness

 You say that indigestion fatigue sleeplessness cause
 distressed stomachs and aching heads Then
16518 you consult your brain in order to remember
 what has hurt you when your remedy lies in forgetting
1661 the whole thing for matter has no sensation of its own
 and the human mind is all that can produce pain

1663 As a man thinketh so is he Mind is all that feels
 acts or impedes action Ignorant of this or shrinking
 from its implied responsibility the healing effort is made
1666 on the wrong side and thus the conscious control over the
 body is lost

 Delusions pagan and medical

 The Mohammedan believes in a pilgrimage to Mecca
1669 for the salvation of his soul The popular doctor believes
 in his prescription and the pharmacist believes
 in the power of his drugs to save a mans
16612 life The Mohammedans belief is a religious
 delusion the doctors and pharmacists is a medical
 mistake

 Health from reliance on spirituality

16615 The erring human mind is inharmonious in itself
 From it arises the inharmonious body To ignore
 God as of little use in sickness is a mistake
16618 Instead of thrusting Him aside in times of
 bodily trouble and waiting for the hour of
 strength in which to acknowledge Him we should learn
16621 that He can do all things for us in sickness as in
 health

 Failing to recover health through adherence to physi
16624 ology and hygiene the despairing invalid often drops
 them and in his extremity and only as a last resort turns
 to God The invalids faith in the divine Mind is less
16627 than in drugs air and exercise or he would have resorted
 to Mind first The balance of power is conceded to be
 with matter by most of the medical systems but when
16630 Mind at last asserts its mastery over sin disease and
 death then is man found to be harmonious and
 immortal

1671 Should we implore a corporeal God to heal the sick
 out of His personal volition or should we understand the
1673 infinite divine Principle which heals If we rise no higher
 than blind faith the Science of healing is not attained and
 Soulexistence in the place of senseexistence is not com
1676 prehended We apprehend Life in divine Science only
 as we live above corporeal sense and correct it Our pro
 portionate admission of the claims of good or of evil de
1679 termines the harmony of our existence  our health our
 longevity and our Christianity

 The two masters

 We cannot serve two masters nor perceive divine Sci
16712 ence with the material senses Drugs and hygiene cannot
 successfully usurp the place and power of the
 divine source of all health and perfection If
16715 God made man both good and evil man must remain
 thus What can improve Gods work Again an error
 in the premise must appear in the conclusion To have
16718 one God and avail yourself of the power of Spirit you
 must love God supremely

 Halfway success

 The flesh lusteth against the Spirit The flesh and
16721 Spirit can no more unite in action than good can coin
 cide with evil It is not wise to take a halt
 ing and halfway position or to expect to work
16724 equally with Spirit and matter Truth and error There
 is but one way  namely God and His idea  which
 leads to spiritual being The scientific government of the
16727 body must be attained through the divine Mind It is im
 possible to gain control over the body in any other way
 On this fundamental point timid conservatism is abso
16730 lutely inadmissible Only through radical reliance on
 Truth can scientific healing power be realized

 Substituting good words for a good life fair seeming
1681 for straightforward character is a poor shift for the weak
 and worldly who think the standard of Christian Science
1683 too high for them

 Belief on the wrong side

 If the scales are evenly adjusted the removal of a single
 weight from either scale gives preponderance to the oppo
1686 site Whatever influence you cast on the side
 of matter you take away from Mind which
 would otherwise outweigh all else Your belief militates
1689 against your health when it ought to be enlisted on the
 side of health When sick according to belief you rush
 after drugs search out the material socalled laws of
16812 health and depend upon them to heal you though you
 have already brought yourself into the slough of disease
 through just this false belief

 The divine authority

16815 Because manmade systems insist that man becomes
 sick and useless suffers and dies all in consonance with
 the laws of God are we to believe it Are
16818 we to believe an authority which denies Gods
 spiritual command relating to perfection  an authority
 which Jesus proved to be false He did the will of the
16821 Father He healed sickness in defiance of what is called
 material law but in accordance with Gods law the law
 of Mind

 Disease foreseen

16824 I have discerned disease in the human mind and rec
 ognized the patients fear of it months before the socalled
 disease made its appearance in the body Dis
16827 ease being a belief a latent illusion of mortal
 mind the sensation would not appear if the error of belief
 was met and destroyed by truth

 Changed mentality

16830 Here let a word be noticed which will be
 better understood hereafter  chemicalization
 By chemicalization I mean the process which mortal
1691 mind and body undergo in the change of belief from a
 material to a spiritual basis

 Scientific foresight

1693 Whenever an aggravation of symptoms has occurred
 through mental chemicalization I have seen the mental
 signs assuring me that danger was over before
1696 the patient felt the change and I have said
 to the patient You are healed  sometimes to his dis
 comfiture when he was incredulous But it always came
1699 about as I had foretold

 I name these facts to show that disease has a mental
 mortal origin  that faith in rules of health or in drugs
16912 begets and fosters disease by attracting the mind to the
 subject of sickness by exciting fear of disease and by dos
 ing the body in order to avoid it The faith reposed in
16915 these things should find stronger supports and a higher
 home If we understood the control of Mind over body
 we should put no faith in material means

 Mind the only healer

16918 Science not only reveals the origin of all disease as
 mental but it also declares that all disease is cured by
 divine Mind There can be no healing ex
16921 cept by this Mind however much we trust
 a drug or any other means towards which human faith
 or endeavor is directed It is mortal mind not mat
16924 ter which brings to the sick whatever good they may
 seem to receive from materiality But the sick are never
 really healed except by means of the divine power
16927 Only the action of Truth Life and Love can give
 harmony

 Modes of matter

 Whatever teaches man to have other laws and to
16930 acknowledge other powers than the divine
 Mind is antiChristian The good that a
 poisonous drug seems to do is evil for it robs man of
1701 reliance on God omnipotent Mind and according to be
 lief poisons the human system Truth is not the basis of
1703 theogony Modes of matter form neither a moral nor a
 spiritual system The discord which calls for material
 methods is the result of the exercise of faith in material
1706 modes  faith in matter instead of in Spirit

 Physiology unscientific

 Did Jesus understand the economy of man less than
 Graham or Cutter Christian ideas certainly present
1709 what human theories exclude  the Principle
 of mans harmony The text Whosoever
 liveth and believeth in me shall never die not only con
17012 tradicts human systems but points to the selfsustaining
 and eternal Truth

 The demands of Truth are spiritual and reach the
17015 body through Mind The best interpreter of mans needs
 said Take no thought for your life what ye shall eat
 or what ye shall drink

17018 If there are material laws which prevent disease what
 then causes it Not divine law for Jesus healed the
 sick and cast out error always in opposition never in
17021 obedience to physics

 Causation considered

 Spiritual causation is the one question to be considered
 for more than all others spiritual causation relates to
17024 human progress The age seems ready to
 approach this subject to ponder somewhat
 the supremacy of Spirit and at least to touch the hem
17027 of Truths garment

 The description of man as purely physical or as both
 material and spiritual  but in either case dependent
17030 upon his physical organization  is the Pandora box
 from which all ills have gone forth especially despair
 Matter which takes divine power into its own hands and
1711 claims to be a creator is a fiction in which paganism and
 lust are so sanctioned by society that mankind has caught
1713 their moral contagion

 Paradise regained

 Through discernment of the spiritual opposite of ma
 teriality even the way through Christ Truth man will
1716 reopen with the key of divine Science the gates
 of Paradise which human beliefs have closed
 and will find himself unfallen upright pure and free
1719 not needing to consult almanacs for the probabilities either
 of his life or of the weather not needing to study brain
 ology to learn how much of a man he is

 A closed question

17112 Minds control over the universe including man is
 no longer an open question but is demonstrable Science
 Jesus illustrated the divine Principle and the
17115 power of immortal Mind by healing sickness
 and sin and destroying the foundations of death

 Matter versus Spirit

 Mistaking his origin and nature man believes himself to
17118 be combined matter and Spirit He believes that Spirit
 is sifted through matter carried on a nerve ex
 posed to ejection by the operation of matter
17121 The intellectual the moral the spiritual  yea the image
 of infinite Mind  subject to nonintelligence

 No more sympathy exists between the flesh and Spirit
17124 than between Belial and Christ

 The socalled laws of matter are nothing but false be
 liefs that intelligence and life are present where Mind
17127 is not These false beliefs are the procuring cause of all
 sin and disease The opposite truth that intelligence and
 life are spiritual never material destroys sin sickness
17130 and death

 The fundamental error lies in the supposition that man
 is a material outgrowth and that the cognizance of good
1721 or evil which he has through the bodily senses con
 stitutes his happiness or misery

 Godless Evolution

1723 Theorizing about mans development from mushrooms
 to monkeys and from monkeys into men
 amounts to nothing in the right direction and
1726 very much in the wrong

 Materialism grades the human species as rising from
 matter upward How then is the material species main
1729 tained if man passes through what we call death and
 death is the Rubicon of spirituality Spirit can form
 no real link in this supposed chain of material being
17212 But divine Science reveals the eternal chain of existence
 as uninterrupted and wholly spiritual yet this can be
 realized only as the false sense of being disappears

 Degrees of development

17215 If man was first a material being he must have passed
 through all the forms of matter in order to become man
 If the material body is man he is a portion of
17218 matter or dust On the contrary man is the
 image and likeness of Spirit and the belief that there is
 Soul in sense or Life in matter obtains in mortals alias
17221 mortal mind to which the apostle refers when he says
 that we must put off the old man

 Identity not lost

 What is man Brain heart blood bones etc the
17224 material structure If the real man is in the material
 body you take away a portion of the man when
 you amputate a limb the surgeon destroys
17227 manhood and worms annihilate it But the loss of a limb
 or injury to a tissue is sometimes the quickener of manli
 ness and the unfortunate cripple may present more no
17230 bility than the statuesque athlete  teaching us by his
 very deprivations that a mans a man for a that

 When man is man

 When we admit that matter heart blood brain acting
1731 through the five physical senses constitutes man we fail
 to see how anatomy can distinguish between
1733 humanity and the brute or determine when
 man is really man and has progressed farther than his
 animal progenitors

 Individualization

1736 When the supposition that Spirit is within what it
 creates and the potter is subject to the clay
 is individualized Truth is reduced to the level
1739 of error and the sensible is required to be made manifest
 through the insensible

 What is termed matter manifests nothing but a material
17312 mentality Neither the substance nor the manifestation
 of Spirit is obtainable through matter Spirit is positive
 Matter is Spirits contrary the absence of Spirit For
17315 positive Spirit to pass through a negative condition
 would be Spirits destruction

 Man not structural

 Anatomy declares man to be structural Physiology
17318 continues this explanation measuring human
 strength by bones and sinews and human life
 by material law Man is spiritual individual and eter
17321 nal material structure is mortal
 Phrenology makes man knavish or honest according to
 the development of the cranium but anatomy physiology
17324 phrenology do not define the image of God the real im
 mortal man

 Human reason and religion come slowly to the recogni
17327 tion of spiritual facts and so continue to call upon
 matter to remove the error which the human mind alone
 has created

17330 The idols of civilization are far more fatal to health
 and longevity than are the idols of barbarism The idols
 of civilization call into action less faith than Buddhism
1741 in a supreme governing intelligence The Esquimaux
 restore health by incantations as consciously as do civi
1743 lized practitioners by their more studied methods

 Is civilization only a higher form of idolatry that
 man should bow down to a fleshbrush to flannels to
1746 baths diet exercise and air Nothing save divine
 power is capable of doing so much for man as he can
 do for himself

 Rise of thought

1749 The footsteps of thought rising above material stand
 points are slow and portend a long night to the traveller
 but the angels of His presence  the spiritual
17412 intuitions that tell us when the night is far
 spent the day is at hand  are our guardians in the
 gloom Whoever opens the way in Christian Science is
17415 a pilgrim and stranger marking out the path for gen
 erations yet unborn

 The thunder of Sinai and the Sermon on the Mount
17418 are pursuing and will overtake the ages rebuking in
 their course all error and proclaiming the kingdom of
 heaven on earth Truth is revealed It needs only to
17421 be practised

 Medical errors

 Mortal belief is all that enables a drug to cure mortal
 ailments Anatomy admits that mind is somewhere in
17424 man though out of sight Then if an indi
 vidual is sick why treat the body alone and
 administer a dose of despair to the mind Why declare
17427 that the body is diseased and picture this disease to the
 mind rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel and
 holding it before the thought of both physician and pa
17430 tient We should understand that the cause of disease
 obtains in the mortal human mind and its cure comes
 from the immortal divine Mind We should prevent the
1751 images of disease from taking form in thought and we
 should efface the outlines of disease already formulated in
1753 the minds of mortals

 Novel Diseases

 When there are fewer prescriptions and less thought is
 given to sanitary subjects there will be better
1756 constitutions and less disease In old times
 who ever heard of dyspepsia cerebrospinal meningitis
 hayfever and rosecold

1759 What an abuse of natural beauty to say that a rose
 the smile of God can produce suffering The joy of its
 presence its beauty and fragrance should uplift the
17512 thought and dissuade any sense of fear or fever It is
 profane to fancy that the perfume of clover and the breath
 of newmown hay can cause glandular inflammation
17515 sneezing and nasal pangs

 No ancestral dyspepsia

 If a random thought calling itself dyspepsia had
 tried to tyrannize over our forefathers it would have
17518 been routed by their independence and in
 dustry Then people had less time for self
 ishness coddling and sickly afterdinner talk The ex
17521 act amount of food the stomach could digest was not
 discussed according to Cutter nor referred to sanitary
 laws A mans belief in those days was not so severe
17524 upon the gastric juices Beaumonts Medical Experi
 ments did not govern the digestion

 Pulmonary misbeliefs

 Damp atmosphere and freezing snow empurpled the
17527 plump cheeks of our ancestors but they never indulged
 in the refinement of inflamed bronchial tubes
 They were as innocent as Adam before he ate
17530 the fruit of false knowledge of the existence of tubercles
 and troches lungs and lozenges

 Our modern Eves

 Where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise says
1761 the English poet and there is truth in his sentiment The
 action of mortal mind on the body was not so injurious
1763 before inquisitive modern Eves took up the
 study of medical works and unmanly Adams
 attributed their own downfall and the fate of their off
1766 spring to the weakness of their wives

 The primitive custom of taking no thought about
 food left the stomach and bowels free to act in obedi
1769 ence to nature and gave the gospel a chance to be seen
 in its glorious effects upon the body A ghastly array of
 diseases was not paraded before the imagination There
17612 were fewer books on digestion and more sermons in
 stones and good in everything When the mechanism
 of the human mind gives place to the divine Mind self
17615 ishness and sin disease and death will lose their
 foothold

 Human fear of miasma would load with disease the
17618 air of Eden and weigh down mankind with superimposed
 and conjectural evils Mortal mind is the worst foe of
 the body while divine Mind is its best friend

 Diseases not to be classified

17621 Should all cases of organic disease be treated by a
 regular practitioner and the Christian Scientist try
 truth only in cases of hysteria hypochon
17624 dria and hallucination One disease is no
 more real than another All disease is the
 result of education and disease can carry its illeffects
17627 no farther than mortal mind maps out the way The
 human mind not matter is supposed to feel suffer en
 joy Hence decided types of acute disease are quite as
17630 ready to yield to Truth as the less distinct type and chronic
 form of disease Truth handles the most malignant con
 tagion with perfect assurance

 One basis for all sickness

1771 Human mind produces what is termed organic dis
 ease as certainly as it produces hysteria and it must re
1773 linquish all its errors sicknesses and sins
 I have demonstrated this beyond all cavil
 The evidence of divine Minds healing power and abso
1776 lute control is to me as certain as the evidence of my own
 existence

 Mental and physical oneness

 Mortal mind and body are one Neither exists without
1779 the other and both must be destroyed by immortal Mind
 Matter or body is but a false concept of mor
 tal mind This socalled mind builds its own
17712 superstructure of which the material body is
 the grosser portion but from first to last the body is a
 sensuous human concept

 The effect of names

17715 In the Scriptural allegory of the material creation
 Adam or error which represents the erroneous theory
 of life and intelligence in matter had the
17718 naming of all that was material These names
 indicated matters properties qualities and forms But
 a lie the opposite of Truth cannot name the qualities and
17721 effects of what is termed matter and create the socalled
 laws of the flesh nor can a lie hold the preponderance
 of power in any direction against God Spirit and
17724 Truth

 Poison defined mentally

 If a dose of poison is swallowed through mistake and
 the patient dies even though physician and
17727 patient are expecting favorable results does
 human belief you ask cause this death Even
 so and as directly as if the poison had been intentionally
17730 taken

 In such cases a few persons believe the potion swal
 lowed by the patient to be harmless but the vast ma
1781 jority of mankind though they know nothing of this par
 ticular case and this special person believe the arsenic
1783 the strychnine or whatever the drug used to be poi
 sonous for it is set down as a poison by mortal mind
 Consequently the result is controlled by the majority of
1786 opinions not by the infinitesimal minority of opinions in
 the sickchamber

 Heredity is not a law The remote cause or belief
1789 of disease is not dangerous because of its priority and
 the connection of past mortal thoughts with present
 The predisposing cause and the exciting cause are
17812 mental

 Perhaps an adult has a deformity produced prior to his
 birth by the fright of his mother When wrested from
17815 human belief and based on Science or the divine Mind to
 which all things are possible that chronic case is not
 difficult to cure

 Animal magnetism destroyed

17818 Mortal mind acting from the basis of sensation in
 matter is animal magnetism but this socalled mind
 from which comes all evil contradicts itself
17821 and must finally yield to the eternal Truth or
 the divine Mind expressed in Science In pro
 portion to our understanding of Christian Science we are
17824 freed from the belief of heredity of mind in matter or ani
 mal magnetism and we disarm sin of its imaginary power
 in proportion to our spiritual understanding of the status
17827 of immortal being

 Ignorant of the methods and the basis of metaphysical
 healing you may attempt to unite with it hypnotism
17830 spiritualism electricity but none of these methods can
 be mingled with metaphysical healing

 Whoever reaches the understanding of Christian Science
1791 in its proper signification will perform the sudden cures
 of which it is capable but this can be done only by
1793 taking up the cross and following Christ in the daily
 life

 Absent patients

 Science can heal the sick who are absent from their
1796 healers as well as those present since space is no ob
 stacle to Mind Immortal Mind heals what eye
 hath not seen but the spiritual capacity to ap
1799 prehend thought and to heal by the Truthpower is won
 only as man is found not in selfrighteousness but re
 flecting the divine nature

 Horses mistaught

17912 Every medical method has its advocates The prefer
 ence of mortal mind for a certain method creates a demand
 for that method and the body then seems to re
17915 quire such treatment You can even educate a
 healthy horse so far in physiology that he will take cold
 without his blanket whereas the wild animal left to his
17918 instincts sniffs the wind with delight The epizootic is
 a humanly evolved ailment which a wild horse might
 never have

 Medical works objectionable

17921 Treatises on anatomy physiology and health sustained
 by what is termed material law are the pro
 moters of sickness and disease It should not
17924 be proverbial that so long as you read medical works you
 will be sick

 The sedulous matron  studying her Jahr with homoe
17927 opathic pellet and powder in hand ready to put you
 into a sweat to move the bowels or to produce sleep 
 is unwittingly sowing the seeds of reliance on matter
17930 and her household may erelong reap the effect of this
 mistake

 Descriptions of disease given by physicians and adver
1801 tisements of quackery are both prolific sources of sickness
 As mortal mind is the husbandman of error it should be
1803 taught to do the body no harm and to uproot its false
 sowing

 The invalids outlook

 The patient sufferer tries to be satisfied when he sees
1806 his wouldbe healers busy and his faith in their efforts is
 somewhat helpful to them and to himself but
 in Science one must understand the resusci
1809 tating law of Life This is the seed within itself bearing
 fruit after its kind spoken of in Genesis

 Physicians should not deport themselves as if Mind
18012 were nonexistent nor take the ground that all causation
 is matter instead of Mind Ignorant that the human
 mind governs the body its phenomenon the invalid may
18015 unwittingly add more fear to the mental reservoir already
 overflowing with that emotion

 Wrong and right way

 Doctors should not implant disease in the thoughts of
18018 their patients as they so frequently do by declaring dis
 ease to be a fixed fact even before they go to
 work to eradicate the disease through the ma
18021 terial faith which they inspire Instead of furnishing
 thought with fear they should try to correct this turbulent
 element of mortal mind by the influence of divine Love
18024 which casteth out fear

 When man is governed by God the everpresent
 Mind who understands all things man knows that with
18027 God all things are possible The only way to this
 living Truth which heals the sick is found in the Science
 of divine Mind as taught and demonstrated by Christ
18030 Jesus
 The important decision

 To reduce inflammation dissolve a tumor or cure or
 ganic disease I have found divine Truth more potent than
1811 all lower remedies And why not since Mind God is
 the source and condition of all existence Before decid
1813 ing that the body matter is disordered one
 should ask Who art thou that repliest to
 Spirit Can matter speak for itself or does
1816 it hold the issues of life Matter which can neither
 suffer nor enjoy has no partnership with pain and pleas
 ure but mortal belief has such a partnership

 Manipulation unscientific

1819 When you manipulate patients you trust in electricity
 and magnetism more than in Truth and for
 that reason you employ matter rather than
18112 Mind You weaken or destroy your power when you re
 sort to any except spiritual means

 It is foolish to declare that you manipulate patients but
18115 that you lay no stress on manipulation If this be so why
 manipulate In reality you manipulate because you are
 ignorant of the baneful effects of magnetism or are not
18118 sufficiently spiritual to depend on Spirit In either case
 you must improve your mental condition till you finally
 attain the understanding of Christian Science

 Not words but deeds

18121 If you are too material to love the Science of Mind and
 are satisfied with good words instead of effects if you
 adhere to error and are afraid to trust Truth
18124 the question then recurs Adam where art
 thou It is unnecessary to resort to aught besides
 Mind in order to satisfy the sick that you are doing some
18127 thing for them for if they are cured they generally know
 it and are satisfied

 Where your treasure is there will your heart be also
18130 If you have more faith in drugs than in Truth this faith
 will incline you to the side of matter and error Any
 hypnotic power you may exercise will diminish your
1821 ability to become a Scientist and vice versa The act
 of healing the sick through divine Mind alone of casting
1823 out error with Truth shows your position as a Christian
 Scientist

 Physiology or Spirit

 The demands of God appeal to thought only but the
1826 claims of mortality and what are termed laws of nature
 appertain to matter Which then are we to
 accept as legitimate and capable of producing
1829 the highest human good We cannot obey both physi
 ology and Spirit for one absolutely destroys the other
 and one or the other must be supreme in the affections
18212 It is impossible to work from two standpoints If we
 attempt it we shall presently hold to the one
 and despise the other

18215 The hypotheses of mortals are antagonistic to Science
 and cannot mix with it This is clear to those who heal
 the sick on the basis of Science

 No material law

18218 Minds government of the body must supersede the so
 called laws of matter Obedience to material law pre
 vents full obedience to spiritual law  the law
18221 which overcomes material conditions and puts
 matter under the feet of Mind Mortals entreat the di
 vine Mind to heal the sick and forthwith shut out the aid
18224 of Mind by using material means thus working against
 themselves and their prayers and denying mans God
 given ability to demonstrate Minds sacred power Pleas
18227 for drugs and laws of health come from some sad incident
 or else from ignorance of Christian Science and its tran
 scendent power

18230 To admit that sickness is a condition over which God
 has no control is to presuppose that omnipotent power
 is powerless on some occasions The law of Christ or
1831 Truth makes all things possible to Spirit but the so
 called laws of matter would render Spirit of no avail and
1833 demand obedience to materialistic codes thus departing
 from the basis of one God one lawmaker To suppose
 that God constitutes laws of inharmony is a mistake dis
1836 cords have no support from nature or divine law however
 much is said to the contrary

 Can the agriculturist according to belief produce a
1839 crop without sowing the seed and awaiting its germina
 tion according to the laws of nature The answer is no
 and yet the Scriptures inform us that sin or error first
18312 caused the condemnation of man to till the ground and
 indicate that obedience to God will remove this necessity
 Truth never made error necessary nor devised a law to
18315 perpetuate error

 Laws of nature spiritual

 The supposed laws which result in weariness and dis
 ease are not His laws for the legitimate and only possible
18318 action of Truth is the production of harmony
 Laws of nature are laws of Spirit but mortals
 commonly recognize as law that which hides the power of
18321 Spirit Divine Mind rightly demands mans entire obe
 dience affection and strength No reservation is made
 for any lesser loyalty Obedience to Truth gives man
18324 power and strength Submission to error superinduces
 loss of power

 Belief and understanding

 Truth casts out all evils and materialistic methods
18327 with the actual spiritual law  the law which gives
 sight to the blind hearing to the deaf voice
 to the dumb feet to the lame If Christian
18330 Science dishonors human belief it honors spir
 itual understanding and the one Mind only is entitled to
 honor

1841 The socalled laws of health are simply laws of mortal
 belief The premises being erroneous the conclusions
1843 are wrong Truth makes no laws to regulate sickness
 sin and death for these are unknown to Truth and should
 not be recognized as reality

1846 Belief produces the results of belief and the penal
 ties it affixes last so long as the belief and are insepara
 ble from it The remedy consists in probing the trouble
1849 to the bottom in finding and casting out by denial the
 error of belief which produces a mortal disorder never
 honoring erroneous belief with the title of law nor yield
18412 ing obedience to it Truth Life and Love are the only
 legitimate and eternal demands on man and they are
 spiritual lawgivers enforcing obedience through divine
18415 statutes

 Laws of human belief

 Controlled by the divine intelligence man is harmoni
 ous and eternal Whatever is governed by a false belief
18418 is discordant and mortal We say man suffers
 from the effects of cold heat fatigue This
 is human belief not the truth of being for matter cannot
18421 suffer Mortal mind alone suffers  not because a law
 of matter has been transgressed but because a law of this
 socalled mind has been disobeyed I have demonstrated
18424 this as a rule of divine Science by destroying the delusion
 of suffering from what is termed a fatally broken physical
 law

18427 A woman whom I cured of consumption always
 breathed with great difficulty when the wind was from
 the east I sat silently by her side a few moments Her
18430 breath came gently The inspirations were deep and nat
 ural I then requested her to look at the weathervane
 She looked and saw that it pointed due east The wind
1851 had not changed but her thought of it had and so her diffi
 culty in breathing had gone The wind had not produced
1853 the difficulty My metaphysical treatment changed the
 action of her belief on the lungs and she never suffered
 again from east winds but was restored to health

 A socalled mindcure

1856 No system of hygiene but Christian Science is purely
 mental Before this book was published other books
 were in circulation which discussed mental
1859 medicine and mindcure operating through
 the power of the earths magnetic currents to regulate life
 and health Such theories and such systems of socalled
18512 mindcure which have sprung up are as material as the
 prevailing systems of medicine They have their birth
 in mortal mind which puts forth a human conception
18515 in the name of Science to match the divine Science of im
 mortal Mind even as the necromancers of Egypt strove
 to emulate the wonders wrought by Moses Such theories
18518 have no relationship to Christian Science which rests on
 the conception of God as the only Life substance and
 intelligence and excludes the human mind as a spiritual
18521 factor in the healing work

 Jesus and hypnotism

 Jesus cast out evil and healed the sick not only with
 out drugs but without hypnotism which is
18524 the reverse of ethical and pathological Truth
 power

 Erroneous mental practice may seem for a time to bene
18527 fit the sick but the recovery is not permanent This is
 because erroneous methods act on and through the ma
 terial stratum of the human mind called brain which is
18530 but a mortal consolidation of material mentality and its
 suppositional activities

 False stimulus

 A patient under the influence of mortal mind is healed
1861 only by removing the influence on him of this mind by
 emptying his thought of the false stimulus
1863 and reaction of willpower and filling it with
 the divine energies of Truth

 Christian Science destroys material beliefs through the
1866 understanding of Spirit and the thoroughness of this work
 determines health Erring human mindforces can work
 only evil under whatever name or pretence they are em
1869 ployed for Spirit and matter good and evil light and
 darkness cannot mingle

 Evil negative and selfdestructive

 Evil is a negation because it is the absence of truth
18612 It is nothing because it is the absence of something It
 is unreal because it presupposes the absence
 of God the omnipotent and omnipresent
18615 Every mortal must learn that there is neither
 power nor reality in evil

 Evil is selfassertive It says I am a real entity over
18618 mastering good This falsehood should strip evil of all
 pretensions The only power of evil is to destroy itself It
 can never destroy one iota of good Every attempt of evil
18621 to destroy good is a failure and only aids in peremptorily
 punishing the evildoer If we concede the same reality to
 discord as to harmony discord has as lasting a claim upon
18624 us as has harmony If evil is as real as good evil is also as
 immortal If death is as real as Life immortality is a myth
 If pain is as real as the absence of pain both must be im
18627 mortal and if so harmony cannot be the law of being

 Ignorant idolatry

 Mortal mind is ignorant of self or it could never be
 selfdeceived If mortal mind knew how to be better it
18630 would be better Since it must believe in some
 thing besides itself it enthrones matter as deity
 The human mind has been an idolater from the beginning
1871 having other gods and believing in more than the one
 Mind

1873 As mortals do not comprehend even mortal existence
 how ignorant must they be of the allknowing Mind and
 of His creations

1876 Here you may see how socalled material sense creates
 its own forms of thought gives them material names and
 then worships and fears them With pagan blindness
1879 it attributes to some material god or medicine an ability
 beyond itself The beliefs of the human mind rob and
 enslave it and then impute this result to another illusive
18712 personification named Satan

 Action of mortal mind

 The valves of the heart opening and closing for the pas
 sage of the blood obey the mandate of mor
18715 tal mind as directly as does the hand ad
 mittedly moved by the will Anatomy allows the mental
 cause of the latter action but not of the former

18718 We say My hand hath done it What is this my but
 mortal mind the cause of all materialistic action All
 voluntary as well as miscalled involuntary action of the
18721 mortal body is governed by this socalled mind not by
 matter There is no involuntary action The divine Mind
 includes all action and volition and man in Science is gov
18724 erned by this Mind The human mind tries to classify
 action as voluntary and involuntary and suffers from the
 attempt
 Death and the body

18727 If you take away this erring mind the mortal material
 body loses all appearance of life or action and this so
 called mind then calls itself dead but the hu
18730 man mind still holds in belief a body through
 which it acts and which appears to the human mind to
 live  a body like the one it had before death This body
1881 is put off only as the mortal erring mind yields to God
 immortal Mind and man is found in His image

 Embryonic sinful thoughts

1883 What is termed disease does not exist It is neither
 mind nor matter The belief of sin which has grown
 terrible in strength and influence is an uncon
1886 scious error in the beginning  an embryonic
 thought without motive but afterwards it
 governs the socalled man Passion depraved appetites
1889 dishonesty envy hatred revenge ripen into action only to
 pass from shame and woe to their final punishment

 Disease a dream

 Mortal existence is a dream of pain and pleasure in
18812 matter a dream of sin sickness and death and it is like
 the dream we have in sleep in which every one
 recognizes his condition to be wholly a state of
18815 mind In both the waking and the sleeping dream the
 dreamer thinks that his body is material and the suffering
 is in that body

18818 The smile of the sleeper indicates the sensation pro
 duced physically by the pleasure of a dream In the
 same way pain and pleasure sickness and care are
18821 traced upon mortals by unmistakable signs

 Sickness is a growth of error springing from mortal
 ignorance or fear Error rehearses error What causes
18824 disease cannot cure it The soil of disease is mortal
 mind and you have an abundant or scanty crop of disease
 according to the seedlings of fear Sin and the fear of
18827 disease must be uprooted and cast out

 Sense yields to understanding

 When darkness comes over the earth the physical
 senses have no immediate evidence of a sun
18830 The human eye knows not where the orb of
 day is nor if it exists Astronomy gives the
 desired information regarding the sun The human or
1891 material senses yield to the authority of this science and
 they are willing to leave with astronomy the explanation of
1893 the suns influence over the earth If the eyes see no sun
 for a week we still believe that there is solar light and
 heat Science in this instance named natural raises
1896 the human thought above the cruder theories of the
 human mind and casts out a fear

 In like manner mortals should no more deny the power
1899 of Christian Science to establish harmony and to explain
 the effect of mortal mind on the body though the cause
 be unseen than they should deny the existence of the sun
18912 light when the orb of day disappears or doubt that the sun
 will reappear The sins of others should not make good
 men suffer

 Ascending the scale

18915 We call the body material but it is as truly mortal
 mind according to its degree as is the material brain
 which is supposed to furnish the evidence
18918 of all mortal thought or things The human
 mortal mind by an inevitable perversion makes all
 things start from the lowest instead of from the highest
18921 mortal thought The reverse is the case with all the
 formations of the immortal divine Mind They proceed
 from the divine source and so in tracing them we con
18924 stantly ascend in infinite being

 Human reproduction

 From mortal mind comes the reproduction of the
 species  first the belief of inanimate and then of ani
18927 mate matter According to mortal thought
 the development of embryonic mortal mind
 commences in the lower basal portion of the brain and
18930 goes on in an ascending scale by evolution keeping always
 in the direct line of matter for matter is the subjective
 condition of mortal mind

1901 Next we have the formation of socalled embryonic
 mortal mind afterwards mortal men or mortals  all this
1903 while matter is a belief ignorant of itself ignorant of what
 it is supposed to produce The mortal says that an inani
 mate unconscious seedling is producing mortals both body
1906 and mind and yet neither a mortal mind nor the immortal
 Mind is found in brain or elsewhere in matter or in mortals

 Human stature

 This embryonic and materialistic human belief called
1909 mortal man in turn fills itself with thoughts
 of pain and pleasure of life and death and
 arranges itself into five socalled senses which presently
19012 measure mind by the size of a brain and the bulk of a
 body called man

 Human frailty

 Human birth growth maturity and decay are as the
19015 grass springing from the soil with beautiful green blades
 afterwards to wither and return to its native
 nothingness This mortal seeming is temporal
19018 it never merges into immortal being but finally disap
 pears and immortal man spiritual and eternal is found
 to be the real man
19021 The Hebrew bard swayed by mortal thoughts thus
 swept his lyre with saddening strains on human existence

 As for man his days are as grass
19024 As a flower of the field so he flourisheth
 For the wind passeth over it and it is gone
 And the place thereof shall know it no more

19027 When hope rose higher in the human heart he sang

 As for me I will behold Thy face in righteousness
 I shall be satisfied when I awake with Thy likeness
     
19030 For with Thee is the fountain of life
 In Thy light shall we see light

1911 The brain can give no idea of Gods man It can take
 no cognizance of Mind Matter is not the organ of infi
1913 nite Mind

 As mortals give up the delusion that there is more than
 one Mind more than one God man in Gods likeness will
1916 appear and this eternal man will include in that likeness
 no material element

 The immortal birth

 As a material theoretical lifebasis is found to be a
1919 misapprehension of existence the spiritual and divine
 Principle of man dawns upon human thought
 and leads it to where the young child was
19112  even to the birth of a newold idea to the spiritual
 sense of being and of what Life includes This the whole
 earth will be transformed by Truth on its pinions of light
19115 chasing away the darkness of error

 Spiritual freedom

 The human thought must free itself from selfimposed
 materiality and bondage It should no longer
19118 ask of the head heart or lungs What are
 mans prospects for life Mind is not helpless Intelli
 gence is not mute before nonintelligence

19121 By its own volition not a blade of grass springs up not
 a spray buds within the vale not a leaf unfolds its fair
 outlines not a flower starts from its cloistered cell

19124 The Science of being reveals man and immortality as
 based on Spirit Physical sense defines mortal man as
 based on matter and from this premise infers the mor
19127 tality of the body

 No physical affinity

 The illusive senses may fancy affinities with their op
 posites but in Christian Science Truth never mingles
19130 with error Mind has no affinity with matter
 and therefore Truth is able to cast out the ills
 of the flesh Mind God sends forth the aroma of Spirit
1921 the atmosphere of intelligence The belief that a pulpy
 substance under the skull is mind is a mockery of intelli
1923 gence a mimicry of Mind

 We are Christian Scientists only as we quit our reliance
 upon that which is false and grasp the true We are not
1926 Christian Scientists until we leave all for Christ Human
 opinions are not spiritual They come from the hearing
 of the ear from corporeality instead of from Principle
1929 and from the mortal instead of from the immortal Spirit
 is not separate from God Spirit is God

 Human power a blind force

 Erring power is a material belief a blind miscalled force
19212 the offspring of will and not of wisdom of the mortal mind
 and not of the immortal It is the headlong
 cataract the devouring flame the tempests
19215 breath It is lightning and hurricane all that is selfish
 wicked dishonest and impure

 The one real power

 Moral and spiritual might belong to Spirit who holds
19218 the wind in His fists and this teaching accords with
 Science and harmony In Science you can
 have no power opposed to God and the physi
19221 cal senses must give up their false testimony Your in
 fluence for good depends upon the weight you throw into
 the right scale The good you do and embody gives you
19224 the only power obtainable Evil is not power It is a
 mockery of strength which erelong betrays its weakness
 and falls never to rise

19227 We walk in the footsteps of Truth and Love by follow
 ing the example of our Master in the understanding of
 divine metaphysics Christianity is the basis of true heal
19230 ing Whatever holds human thought in line with unselfed
 love receives directly the divine power

 Mind cures hipdisease

 I was called to visit Mr Clark in Lynn who had been
1931 confined to his bed six months with hipdisease caused by
 a fall upon a wooden spike when quite a boy On enter
1933 ing the house I met his physician who said that
 the patient was dying The physician had just
 probed the ulcer on the hip and said the bone was carious
1936 for several inches He even showed me the probe which
 had on it the evidence of this condition of the bone The
 doctor went out Mr Clark lay with his eyes fixed and
1939 sightless The dew of death was on his brow I went to
 his bedside In a few moments his face changed its
 deathpallor gave place to a natural hue The eyelids
19312 closed gently and the breathing became natural he was
 asleep In about ten minutes he opened his eyes and
 said I feel like a new man My suffering is all gone
19315 It was between three and four oclock in the afternoon
 when this took place

 I told him to rise dress himself and take supper with
19318 his family He did so The next day I saw him in the
 yard Since then I have not seen him but am informed
 that he went to work in two weeks The discharge from
19321 the sore stopped and the sore was healed The diseased
 condition had continued there ever since the injury was
 received in boyhood
19324 Since his recovery I have been informed that his physi
 cian claims to have cured him and that his mother has
 been threatened with incarceration in an insane asylum
19327 for saying It was none other than God and that woman
 who healed him I cannot attest the truth of that
 report but what I saw and did for that man and what
19330 his physician said of the case occurred just as I have
 narrated

 It has been demonstrated to me that Life is God
1941 and that the might of omnipotent Spirit shares not its
 strength with matter or with human will Review
1943 ing this brief experience I cannot fail to discern the
 coincidence of the spiritual idea of man with the divine
 Mind

 Change of belief

1946 A change in human belief changes all the physical symp
 toms and determines a case for better or for
 worse When ones false belief is corrected
1949 Truth sends a report of health over the body

 Destruction of the auditory nerve and paralysis of the
 optic nerve are not necessary to ensure deafness and blind
19412 ness for if mortal mind says I am deaf and blind it
 will be so without an injured nerve Every theory op
 posed to this fact as I learned in metaphysics would
19415 presuppose man who is immortal in spiritual under
 standing a mortal in material belief

 Power of habit

 The authentic history of Kaspar Hauser is a useful hint
19418 as to the frailty and inadequacy of mortal mind It
 proves beyond a doubt that education consti
 tutes this socalled mind and that in turn
19421 mortal mind manifests itself in the body by the false
 sense it imparts Incarcerated in a dungeon where
 neither sight nor sound could reach him at the age of
19424 seventeen Kaspar was still a mental infant crying and
 chattering with no more intelligence than a babe and
 realizing Tennysons description

19427 An infant crying in the night
 An infant crying for the light
 And with no language but a cry

19430 His case proves material sense to be but a belief formed
 by education alone The light which affords us joy gave
1951 him a belief of intense pain His eyes were inflamed by
 the light After the babbling boy had been taught to
1953 speak a few words he asked to be taken back to his dun
 geon and said that he should never be happy elsewhere
 Outside of dismal darkness and cold silence he found no
1956 peace Every sound convulsed him with anguish All
 that he ate except his black crust produced violent
 retchings All that gives pleasure to our educated senses
1959 gave him pain through those very senses trained in an
 opposite direction

 Useful knowledge

 The point for each one to decide is whether it is mortal
19512 mind or immortal Mind that is causative We
 should forsake the basis of matter for meta
 physical Science and its divine Principle

19515 Whatever furnishes the semblance of an idea governed
 by its Principle furnishes food for thought Through as
 tronomy natural history chemistry music mathematics
19518 thought passes naturally from effect back to cause

 Academics of the right sort are requisite Observa
 tion invention study and original thought are expansive
19521 and should promote the growth of mortal mind out of it
 self out of all that is mortal

 It is the tangled barbarisms of learning which we
19524 deplore  the mere dogma the speculative theory the
 nauseous fiction Novels remarkable only for their
 exaggerated pictures impossible ideals and specimens
19527 of depravity fill our young readers with wrong tastes
 and sentiments Literary commercialism is lowering the
 intellectual standard to accommodate the purse and to
19530 meet a frivolous demand for amusement instead of for
 improvement Incorrect views lower the standard of
 truth

1961 If materialistic knowledge is power it is not wisdom
 It is but a blind force Man has sought out many inven
1963 tions but he has not yet found it true that knowledge can
 save him from the dire effects of knowledge The power
 of mortal mind over its own body is little understood

 Sin destroyed through suffering

1966 Better the suffering which awakens mortal mind from
 its fleshly dream than the false pleasures
 which tend to perpetuate this dream Sin
1969 alone brings death for sin is the only element
 of destruction

 Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body
19612 in hell said Jesus A careful study of this text allows
 that here the word soul means a false sense or material
 consciousness The command was a warning to beware
19615 not of Rome Satan nor of God but of sin Sickness
 sin and death are not concomitants of Life or Truth
 No law supports them They have no relation to God
19618 wherewith to establish their power Sin makes its own
 hell and goodness its own heaven

 Dangerous shoals avoided

 Such books as will rule disease out of mortal mind 
19621 and so efface the images and thoughts of dis
 ease instead of impressing them with forcible
 descriptions and medical details  will help
19624 to abate sickness and to destroy it

 Many a hopeless case of disease is induced by a single
 post mortem examination  not from infection nor from
19627 contact with material virus but from the fear of the
 disease and from the image brought before the mind it
 is a mental state which is afterwards outlined on the
19630 body

 Pangs caused by the press

 The press unwittingly sends forth many sorrows and
 diseases among the human family It does this by giv
1971 ing names to diseases and by printing long descriptions
 which mirror images of disease distinctly in thought A
1973 new name for an ailment affects people like a
 Parisian name for a novel garment Every one
 hastens to get it A minutely described dis
1976 ease costs many a man his earthly days of comfort What
 a price for human knowledge But the price does not ex
 ceed the original cost God said of the tree of knowledge
1979 which bears the fruit of sin disease and death In the
 day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die

 Higher standard for mortals

 The less that is said of physical structure and laws and
19712 the more that is thought and said about moral
 and spiritual law the higher will be the stand
 ard of living and the farther mortals will be re
19715 moved from imbecility or disease

 We should master fear instead of cultivating it It
 was the ignorance of our forefathers in the departments
19718 of knowledge now broadcast in the earth that made them
 hardier than our trained physiologists more honest than
 our sleek politicians

 Diet and dyspepsia

19721 We are told that the simple food our forefathers ate
 helped to make them healthy but that is a mistake
 Their diet would not cure dyspepsia at this
19724 period With rules of health in the head
 and the most digestible food in the stomach there would
 still be dyspeptics Many of the effeminate constitutions
19727 of our time will never grow robust until individual opin
 ions improve and immortal belief loses some portion of its
 error

 Harm done by physicians

19730 The doctors mind reaches that of his patient The
 doctor should suppress his fear of disease else his belief
 in its reality and fatality will harm his patients even more
1981 than his calomel and morphine for the higher stratum of
 mortal mind has in belief more power to harm man than
1983 the substratum matter A patient hears the
 doctors verdict as a criminal hears his death
 sentence The patient may seem calm under it but he is
1986 not His fortitude may sustain him but his fear which
 has already developed the disease that is gaining the
 mastery is increased by the physicians words

 Disease depicted

1989 The materialistic doctor though humane is an art
 ist who outlines his thought relative to disease and then
 fills in his delineations with sketches from text
19812 books It is better to prevent disease from
 forming in mortal mind afterwards to appear on the
 body but to do this requires attention The thought of
19815 disease is formed before one sees a doctor and before
 the doctor undertakes to dispel it by a counterirritant
  perhaps by a blister by the application of caustic or
19818 croton oil or by a surgical operation Again giving an
 other direction to faith the physician prescribes drugs
 until the elasticity of mortal thought haply causes a
19821 vigorous reaction upon itself and reproduces a picture
 of healthy and harmonious formations

 A patients belief is more or less moulded and formed
19824 by his doctors belief in the case even though the doctor
 says nothing to support his theory His thoughts and his
 patients commingle and the stronger thoughts rule the
19827 weaker Hence the importance that doctors be Christian
 Scientists

 Mind over matter

 Because the muscles of the blacksmiths arm are
19830 strongly developed it does not follow that
 exercise has produced this result or that a
 less used arm must be weak If matter were the cause
1991 of action and if muscles without volition of mortal
 mind could lift the hammer and strike the anvil it
1993 might be thought true that hammering would enlarge
 the muscles The triphammer is not increased in size
 by exercise Why not since muscles are as material as
1996 wood and iron Because nobody believes that mind is
 producing such a result on the hammer

 Muscles are not selfacting If mind does not move
1999 them they are motionless Hence the great fact that
 Mind alone enlarges and empowers man through its
 mandate  by reason of its demand for and supply of
19912 power Not because of muscular exercise but by rea
 son of the blacksmiths faith in exercise his arm becomes
 stronger

 Latent fear subdued

19915 Mortals develop their own bodies or make them sick
 according as they influence them through mortal mind
 To know whether this development is produced
19918 consciously or unconsciously is of less impor
 tance than a knowledge of the fact The feats of the gym
 nast prove that latent mental fears are subdued by him
19921 The devotion of thought to an honest achievement makes
 the achievement possible Exceptions only confirm this
 rule proving that failure is occasioned by a too feeble
19924 faith

 Had Blondin believed it impossible to walk the rope
 over Niagaras abyss of waters he could never have
19927 done it His belief that he could do it gave his thought
 forces called muscles their flexibility and power which
 the unscientific might attribute to a lubricating oil His
19930 fear must have disappeared before his power of putting
 resolve into action could appear

 Homer and Moses

 When Homer sang of the Grecian gods Olympus was
2001 dark but through his verse the gods became alive in a
 nations belief Pagan worship began with muscularity
2003 but the law of Sinai lifted thought into the
 song of David Moses advanced a nation to
 the worship of God in Spirit instead of matter and il
2006 lustrated the grand human capacities of being bestowed
 by immortal Mind

 A mortal not man

 Whoever is incompetent to explain Soul would be wise
2009 not to undertake the explanation of body Life is always
 has been and ever will be independent of
 matter for life is God and man is the idea
20012 of God not formed materially but spiritually and not
 subject to decay and dust The Psalmist said Thou
 madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy
20015 hands Thou hast put all things under his feet

 The great truth in the Science of being that the real
 man was is and ever shall be perfect is incontrovertible
20018 for if man is the image reflection of God he is neither
 inverted nor subverted but upright and Godlike

 The suppositional antipode of divine infinite Spirit
20021 is the socalled human soul or spirit in other words
 the five senses  the flesh that warreth against Spirit
 These so called material senses must yield to the infinite
20024 Spirit named God

 St Paul said For I determined not to know any
 thing among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified
20027 I Cor ii 2 Christian Science says I am determined
 not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and
 him glorified




 CHAPTER VIII  FOOTSTEPS OF TRUTH

 Remember Lord the reproach of Thy servants how I do bear in
 my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people wherewith Thine
 enemies have reproached O Lord wherewith they have reproached
 the footsteps of Thine anointed  PSALMS

 Practical preaching

2011 THE best sermon ever preached is Truth practised
 and demonstrated by the destruction of sin sickness
2013 and death Knowing this and knowing too
 that one affection would be supreme in us and
 take the lead in our lives Jesus said No man can serve
2016 two masters

 We cannot build safely on false foundations Truth
 makes a new creature in whom old things pass away
2019 and all things are become new Passions selfishness
 false appetites hatred fear all sensuality yield to spirit
 uality and the superabundance of being is on the side
20112 of God good

 The uses of truth

 We cannot fill vessels already full They must first be
 emptied Let us disrobe error Then when
20115 the winds of God blow we shall not hug our
 tatters close about us

 The way to extract error from mortal mind is to pour
20118 in truth through floodtides of Love Christian perfec
 tion is won on no other basis

 Grafting holiness upon unholiness supposing that sin
2021 can be forgiven when it is not forsaken is as foolish as
 straining out gnats and swallowing camels
2023 The scientific unity which exists between God and man
 must be wrought out in lifepractice and Gods will must
 be universally done

 Divine study

2026 If men would bring to bear upon the study of the
 Science of Mind half the faith they bestow upon the so
 called pains and pleasures of material sense
2029 they would not go on from bad to worse
 until disciplined by the prison and the scaffold but
 the whole human family would be redeemed through
20212 the merits of Christ  through the perception and ac
 ceptance of Truth For this glorious result Christian
 Science lights the torch of spiritual understanding

 Harmonious lifework

20215 Outside of this Science all is mutable but immortal
 man in accord with the divine Principle of His being
 God neither sins suffers nor dies The days
20218 of our pilgrimage will multiply instead of di
 minish when Gods kingdom comes on earth for the
 true way leads to life instead of to death and earthly
20221 experience discloses the finity of error and the infinite
 capacities of Truth in which God gives man dominion
 over all the earth

 Belief and practice

20224 Our beliefs about a Supreme Being contradict the
 practice growing out of them Error abounds where
 Truth should much more abound We

20227 admit that God has almighty power is a
 very present help in trouble and yet we rely on a drug
 or hypnotism to heal disease as if senseless matter or err
20230 ing mortal mind had more power than omnipotent Spirit

 Sure reward of righteousness

 Common opinion admits that a man may take cold in
 the act of doing good and that this cold may produce
2031 fatal pulmonary disease as though evil could overbear
 the law of Love and check the reward for do
2033 ing good In the Science of Christianity Mind
  omnipotence  has allpower assigns sure
 rewards to righteousness and shows that matter can
2036 neither heal nor make sick create nor destroy

 Our belief and understanding

 If God were understood instead of being merely be
 lieved this understanding would establish health The
2039 accusation of the rabbis He made himself
 the Son of God was really the justification
 of Jesus for to the Christian the only true
20312 spirit is Godlike This thought incites to a more exalted
 worship and selfabnegation Spiritual perception brings
 out the possibilities of being destroys reliance on aught
20315 but God and so makes man the image of his Maker in
 deed and in truth

 Suicide and sin

 We are prone to believe either in more than one Su
20318 preme Ruler or in some power less than God We im
 agine that Mind can be imprisoned in a sensuous body
 When the material body has gone to ruin when evil has
20321 overtaxed the belief of life in matter and destroyed it
 then mortals believe that the deathless Principle or
 Soul escapes from matter and lives on but this is not
20324 true Death is not a steppingstone to life immortality
 and bliss The socalled sinner is a suicide
 Sin kills the sinner and will continue to kill
20327 him so long as he sins The foam and fury of illegiti
 mate living and of fearful and doleful dying should
 disappear on the shore of time then the waves of sin
20330 sorrow and death beat in vain

 God divine good does not kill a man in order to give
 him eternal Life for God alone is mans life God is at
2041 once the centre and circumference of being It is evil
 that dies good dies not

 Spirit the only intelligence and substance
2043 All forms of error support the false conclusions that
 there is more than one Life that material history is as
 real and living as spiritual history that mortal
2046 error is as conclusively mental as immortal
 Truth and that there are two separate an
 tagonistic entities and beings two powers  namely
2049 Spirit and matter  resulting in a third person mortal
 man who carries out the delusions of sin sickness and
 death

20412 The first power is admitted to be good an intelligence or
 Mind called God The socalled second power evil is the
 unlikeness of good It cannot therefore be mind though
20415 so called The third power mortal man is a supposed
 mixture of the first and second antagonistic powers in
 telligence and nonintelligence of Spirit and matter

 Unscientific theories

20418 Such theories are evidently erroneous They can never
 stand the test of Science Judging them by their fruits
 they are corrupt When will the ages under
20421 stand the Ego and realize only one God one
 Mind or intelligence

 False and selfassertive theories have given sinners the
20424 notion that they can create what God cannot  namely
 sinful mortals in Gods image thus usurping the name
 without the nature of the image or reflection of divine
20427 Mind but in Science it can never be said that man
 has a mind of his own distinct from God the all
 Mind

20430 The belief that God lives in matter is pantheistic The
 error which says that Soul is in body Mind is in matter
 and good is in evil must unsay it and cease from such
2051 utterances else God will continue to be hidden from hu
 manity and mortals will sin without knowing that they
2053 are sinning will lean on matter instead of Spirit stumble
 with lameness drop with drunkenness consume with dis
 case  all because of their blindness their false sense
2056 concerning God and man

 Creation perfect

 When will the error of believing that there is life in
 matter and that sin sickness and death are creations of
2059 God be unmasked When will it be under
 stood that matter has neither intelligence life
 nor sensation and that the opposite belief is the prolific
20512 source of all suffering God created all through Mind
 and made all perfect and eternal Where then is the
 necessity for recreation or procreation

 Perceiving the divine image

20515 Befogged in error the error of believing that matter
 can be intelligent for good or evil we can catch clear
 glimpses of God only as the mists disperse
20518 or as they melt into such thinness that we per
 ceive the divine image in some word or deed
 which indicates the true idea  the supremacy and real
20521 ity of good the nothingness and unreality of evil

 Redemption from selfishness

 When we realize that there is one Mind the divine law
 of loving our neighbor as ourselves is unfolded
20524 whereas a belief in many ruling minds hinders
 mans normal drift towards the one Mind one
 God and leads human thought into opposite channels
20527 where selfishness reigns

 Selfishness tips the beam of human existence towards
 the side of error not towards Truth Denial of the one
20530 ness of Mind throws our weight into the scale not of
 Spirit God good but of matter

 When we fully understand our relation to the Divine
2061 we can have no other Mind but His  no other Love
 wisdom or Truth no other sense of Life and no con
2063 sciousness of the existence of matter or error

 Willpower unrighteous

 The power of the human will should be exercised only
 in subordination to Truth else it will misguide the judg
2066 ment and free the lower propensities It is the
 province of spiritual sense to govern man
 Material erring human thought acts injuriously both
2069 upon the body and through it

 Willpower is capable of all evil It can never heal
 the sick for it is the prayer of the unrighteous while
20612 the exercise of the sentiments  hope faith love  is the
 prayer of the righteous This prayer governed by Science
 instead of the senses heals the sick

20615 In the scientific relation of God to man we find that
 whatever blesses one blesses all as Jesus showed with
 the loaves and the fishes  Spirit not matter being the
20618 source of supply

 Birth and death unreal

 Does God send sickness giving the mother her child
 for the brief space of a few years and then taking it away
20621 by death Is God creating anew what He
 has already created The Scriptures are defi
 nite on this point declaring that His work was finished
20624 nothing is new to God and that it was good

 Can there be any birth or death for man the spiritual
 image and likeness of God Instead of God sending
20627 sickness and death He destroys them and brings to light
 immortality Omnipotent and infinite Mind made all
 and includes all This Mind does not make mistakes
20630 and subsequently correct them God does not cause man
 to sin to be sick or to die

 No evil in Spirit

 There are evil beliefs often called evil spirits but
2071 these evils are not Spirit for there is no evil in Spirit
 Because God is Spirit evil becomes more apparent and
2073 obnoxious proportionately as we advance spir
 itually until it disappears from our lives
 This fact proves our position for every scientific state
2076 ment in Christianity has its proof Error of statement
 leads to error in action

 Subordination of evil

 God is not the creator of an evil mind Indeed evil
2079 is not Mind We must learn that evil is the awful decep
 tion and unreality of existence Evil is not
 supreme good is not helpless nor are the
20712 socalled laws of matter primary and the law of Spirit
 secondary Without this lesson we lose sight of the per
 fect Father or the divine Principle of man

 Evident impossibilities

20715 Body is not first and Soul last nor is evil mightier than
 good The Science of being repudiates self
 evident impossibilities such as the amalgama
20718 tion of Truth and error in cause or effect Science sepa
 rates the tares and wheat in time of harvest

 One primal cause

 There is but one primal cause Therefore there can
20721 be no effect from any other cause and there can be no
 reality in aught which does not proceed from
 this great and only cause Sin sickness dis
20724 ease and death belong not to the Science of being They
 are the errors which presuppose the absence of Truth
 Life or Love

20727 The spiritual reality is the scientific fact in all things
 The spiritual fact repeated in the action of man and the
 whole universe is harmonious and is the ideal of Truth
20730 Spiritual facts are not inverted the opposite discord
 which bears no resemblance to spirituality is not real
 The only evidence of this inversion is obtained from
2081 suppositional error which affords no proof of God
 Spirit or of the spiritual creation Material sense de
2083 fines all things materially and has a finite sense of the
 infinite

 Seemingly independent authority

 The Scriptures say In Him we live and move and
2086 have our being What then is this seeming power in
 dependent of God which causes disease and
 cures it What is it but an error of belief 
2089 a law of mortal mind wrong in every sense
 embracing sin sickness and death It is the very anti
 pode of immortal Mind of Truth and of spiritual law
20812 It is not in accordance with the goodness of Gods char
 acter that He should make man sick then leave man to
 heal himself it is absurd to suppose that matter can both
20815 cause and cure disease or that Spirit God produces
 disease and leaves the remedy to matter

 John Young of Edinburgh writes God is the father
20818 of mind and of nothing else Such an utterance is
 the voice of one crying in the wilderness of human
 beliefs and preparing the way of Science Let us learn
20821 of the real and eternal and prepare for the reign of
 Spirit the kingdom of heaven  the reign and rule of
 universal harmony which cannot be lost nor remain
20824 forever unseen

 Sickness as only thought

 Mind not matter is causation A material body
 only expresses a material and mortal mind A mortal
20827 man possesses this body and he makes it
 harmonious or discordant according to the
 images of thought impressed upon it You embrace
20830 your body in your thought and you should delineate
 upon it thoughts of health not of sickness You should
 banish all thoughts of disease and sin and of other beliefs
2091 included in matter Man being immortal has a perfect
 indestructible life It is the mortal belief which makes
2093 the body discordant and diseased in proportion as igno
 rance fear or human will governs mortals

 Allness of Truth

 Mind supreme over all its formations and governing
2096 them all is the central sun of its own systems of ideas
 the life and light of all its own vast creation
 and man is tributary to divine Mind The
2099 material and mortal body or mind is not the man

 The world would collapse without Mind without the in
 telligence which holds the winds in its grasp Neither
20912 philosophy nor skepticism can hinder the march of the
 Science which reveals the supremacy of Mind The im
 manent sense of Mindpower enhances the glory of Mind
20915 Nearness not distance lends enchantment to this view

 Spiritual translation

 The compounded minerals or aggregated substances
 composing the earth the relations which constituent
20918 masses hold to each other the magnitudes
 distances and revolutions of the celestial
 bodies are of no real importance when we remember
20921 that they all must give place to the spiritual fact by the
 translation of man and the universe back into Spirit In
 proportion as this is done man and the universe will be
20924 found harmonious and eternal

 Material substances or mundane formations astro
 nomical calculations and all the paraphernalia of specu
20927 lative theories based on the hypothesis of material law
 or life and intelligence resident in matter will ulti
 mately vanish swallowed up in the infinite calculus of
20930 Spirit

 Spiritual sense is a conscious constant capacity to un
 derstand God It shows the superiority of faith by works
2101 over faith in words Its ideas are expressed only in new
 tongues and these are interpreted by the translation of
2103 the spiritual original into the language which human
 thought can comprehend

 Jesus disregard of matter

 The Principle and proof of Christianity are discerned
2106 by spiritual sense They are set forth in Jesus demon
 strations which show  by his healing the
 sick casting out evils and destroying death
2109 the last enemy that shall be destroyed 
 his disregard of matter and its socalled laws

 Knowing that Soul and its attributes were forever
 manifested through man the Master healed the sick
 gave sight to the blind hearing to the deaf feet to the
 lame thus bringing to light the scientific action of the
21015 divine Mind on human minds and bodies and giving
 a better understanding of Soul and salvation Jesus
 healed sickness and sin by one and the same metaphysical
21018 process

 Mind not mortal

 The expression mortal mind is really a solecism for
 Mind is immortal and Truth pierces the error of mortality
21021 as a sunbeam penetrates the cloud Because
 in obedience to the immutable law of Spirit
 this socalled mind is selfdestructive I name it mortal
21024 Error soweth the wind and reapeth the whirlwind

 Matter mindless

 What is termed matter being unintelligent cannot say
 I suffer I die I am sick or I am well It is the so
21027 called mortal mind which voices this and ap
 pears to itself to make good its claim To
 mortal sense sin and suffering are real but immortal
21030 sense includes no evil nor pestilence Because immortal
 sense has no error of sense it has no sense of error there
 fore it is without a destructive element

2111 If brain nerves stomach are intelligent  if they talk
 to us tell us their condition and report how they feel 
2113 then Spirit and matter Truth and error commingle
 and produce sickness and health good and evil life and
 death and who shall say whether Truth or error is the
2116 greater

 Matter sensationless

 The sensations of the body must either be the sensa
 tions of a socalled mortal mind or of matter Nerves
2119 are not mind Is it not provable that Mind is
 not mortal and that matter has no sensation
 Is it not equally true that matter does not appear in the
21112 spiritual understanding of being

 The sensation of sickness and the impulse to sin seem
 to obtain in mortal mind When a tear starts does not
21115 this socalled mind produce the effect seen in the lachry
 mal gland Without mortal mind the tear could not
 appear and this action shows the nature of all socalled
21118 material cause and effect

 It should no longer be said in Israel that the fathers
 have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set
21121 on edge Sympathy with error should disappear The
 transfer of the thoughts of one erring mind to another
 Science renders impossible

 Nerves painless

21124 If it is true that nerves have sensation that matter has
 intelligence that the material organism causes the eyes to
 see and the ears to hear then when the body
21127 is dematerialized these faculties must be lost
 for their immortality is not in Spirit whereas the fact
 is that only through dematerialization and spiritualiza
21130 tion of thought can these faculties be conceived of as
 immortal

 Nerves are not the source of pain or pleasure We
2121 suffer or enjoy in our dreams but this pain or pleasure
 is not communicated through a nerve A tooth which has
2123 been extracted sometimes aches again in belief and the
 pain seems to be in its old place A limb which has been
 amputated has continued in belief to pain the owner If
2126 the sensation of pain in the limb can return can be pro
 longed why cannot the limb reappear

 Why need pain rather than pleasure come to this mor
2129 tal sense Because the memory of pain is more vivid
 than the memory of pleasure I have seen an unwitting
 attempt to scratch the end of a finger which had been cut
21212 off for months When the nerve is gone which we say
 was the occasion of pain and the pain still remains it
 proves sensation to be in the mortal mind not in matter
21215 Reverse the process take away this socalled mind instead
 of a piece of the flesh and the nerves have no sensation

 Human falsities

 Mortals have a modus of their own undirected and un
21218 sustained by God They produce a rose through seed and
 soil and bring the rose into contact with the
 olfactory nerves that they may smell it In
21221 legerdemain and credulous frenzy mortals believe that
 unseen spirits produce the flowers God alone makes
 and clothes the lilies of the field and this He does by
21224 means of Mind not matter

 No miracles in Mindmethods

 Because all the methods of Mind are not understood
 we say the lips or hands must move in order to convey
21227 thought that the undulations of the air convey
 sound and possibly that other methods involve
 socalled miracles The realities of being its
21230 normal action and the origin of all things are unseen to
 mortal sense whereas the unreal and imitative move
 ments of mortal belief which would reverse the immortal
2131 modus and action are styled the real Whoever con
 tradicts this mortal mind supposition of reality is called
2133 a deceiver or is said to be deceived Of a man it has
 been said As he thinketh in his heart so is he hence
 as a man spiritually understandeth so is he in truth

 Good indefinable

2136 Mortal mind conceives of something as either liquid
 or solid and then classifies it materially Immortal and
 spiritual facts exist apart from this mortal and
2139 material conception God good is selfexist
 ent and selfexpressed though indefinable as a whole
 Every step towards goodness is a departure from materi
21312 ality and is a tendency towards God Spirit Material
 theories partially paralyze this attraction towards infinite
 and eternal good by an opposite attraction towards the
21315 finite temporary and discordant

 Sound is a mental impression made on mortal belief
 The ear does not really hear Divine Science reveals
21318 sound as communicated through the senses of Soul 
 through spiritual understanding

 Music rhythm of head and heart

 Mozart experienced more than he expressed The
21321 rapture of his grandest symphonies was never heard He
 was a musician beyond what the world knew
 This was even more strikingly true of Beet
21324 hoven who was so long hopelessly deaf Men
 tal melodies and strains of sweetest music supersede con
 scious sound Music is the rhythm of head and heart
21327 Mortal mind is the harp of many strings discoursing
 either discord or harmony according as the hand which
 sweeps over it is human or divine
21330 Before human knowledge dipped to its depths into a
 false sense of things  into belief in material origins
 which discard the one Mind and true source of being 
2141 it is possible that the impressions from Truth were as
 distinct as sound and that they came as sound to the
2143 primitive prophets If the medium of hearing is wholly
 spiritual it is normal and indestructible

 If Enochs perception had been confined to the evidence
2146 before his material senses he could never have walked
 with God nor been guided into the demonstration of
 life eternal

 Adam and the senses

2149 Adam represented in the Scriptures as formed from
 dust is an objectlesson for the human mind The mate
 rial senses like Adam originate in matter and
21412 return to dust  are proved nonintelligent
 They go out as they came in for they are still the error
 not the truth of being When it is learned that the spirit
21415 ual sense and not the material conveys the impressions
 of Mind to man then being will be understood and found
 to be harmonious

 Idolatrous illusions

21418 We bow down to matter and entertain finite thoughts
 of God like the pagan idolater Mortals are inclined to
 fear and to obey what they consider a material
21421 body more than they do a spiritual God All
 material knowledge like the original tree of knowledge
 multiplies their pains for mortal illusions would rob God
21424 slay man and meanwhile would spread their table with
 cannibal tidbits and give thanks

 The senses of Soul

 How transient a sense is mortal sight when a wound on
21427 the retina may end the power of light and lens But the
 real sight or sense is not lost Neither age nor
 accident can interfere with the senses of Soul
21430 and there are no other real senses It is evident that the
 body as matter has no sensation of its own and there is no
 oblivion for Soul and its faculties Spirits senses are with
2151 out pain and they are forever at peace Nothing can hide
 from them the harmony of all things and the might and
2153 permanence of Truth

 Real being never lost

 If Spirit Soul could sin or be lost then being and im
 mortality would be lost together with all the faculties of
2156 Mind but being cannot be lost while God ex
 ists Soul and matter are at variance from the
 very necessity of their opposite natures Mortals are
2159 unacquainted with the reality of existence because matter
 and mortality do not reflect the facts of Spirit

 Spiritual vision is not subordinate to geometric alti
21512 tudes Whatever is governed by God is never for an
 instant deprived of the light and might of intelligence
 and Life

 Light and darkness

21515 We are sometimes led to believe that darkness is as real
 as light but Science affirms darkness to be only a mortal
 sense of the absence of light at the coming of
21518 which darkness loses the appearance of reality
 So sin and sorrow disease and death are the suppositional
 absence of Life God and flee as phantoms of error before
21521 truth and love

 With its divine proof Science reverses the evidence of
 material sense Every quality and condition of mortality
21524 is lost swallowed up in immortality Mortal man is the
 antipode of immortal man in origin in existence and in his
 relation to God

 Faith of Socrates

21527 Because he understood the superiority and immor
 tality of good Socrates feared not the hemlock poison
 Even the faith of his philosophy spurned phys
21530 ical timidity Having sought mans spiritual
 state he recognized the immortality of man The igno
 rance and malice of the age would have killed the vener
2161 able philosopher because of his faith in Soul and his in
 difference to the body

 The serpent of error

2163 Who shall say that man is alive today but may be dead
 tomorrow What has touched Life God to such
 strange issues Here theories cease and Sci
2166 ence unveils the mystery and solves the prob
 lem of man Error bites the heel of truth but cannot kill
 truth Truth bruises the head of error  destroys error
2169 Spirituality lays open siege to materialism On which
 side are we fighting

 Servants and masters

 The understanding that the Ego is Mind and that
21612 there is but one Mind or intelligence begins at once to
 destroy the errors of mortal sense and to supply
 the truth of immortal sense This understand
21615 ing makes the body harmonious it makes the nerves
 bones brain etc servants instead of masters If man
 is governed by the law of divine Mind his body is in sub
21618 mission to everlasting Life and Truth and Love The
 great mistake of mortals is to suppose that man Gods
 image and likeness is both matter and Spirit both good
21621 and evil

 If the decision were left to the corporeal senses evil
 would appear to be the master of good and sickness to
21624 be the rule of existence while health would seem the
 exception death the inevitable and life a paradox Paul
 asked What concord hath Christ with Belial 2 Cor
21627 inthians vi 15

 Personal identity

 When you say Mans body is material I say with
 Paul Be willing rather to be absent from the body
21630 and to be present with the Lord Give up
 your material belief of mind in matter and
 have but one Mind even God for this Mind forms its
2171 own likeness The loss of mans identity through the
 understanding which Science confers is impossible and
2173 the notion of such a possibility is more absurd than to
 conclude that individual musical tones are lost in the
 origin of harmony

 Pauls experience

2176 Medical schools may inform us that the healing work
 of Christian Science and Pauls peculiar Christian con
 version and experience  which prove Mind
2179 to be scientifically distinct from matter  are
 indications of unnatural mental and bodily conditions
 even of catalepsy and hysteria yet if we turn to the Scrip
21712 tures what do we read Why this If a man keep my
 saying he shall never see death and Henceforth know
 we no man after the flesh

 Fatigue is mental

21715 That scientific methods are superior to others is
 seen by their effects When you have once conquered
 a diseased condition of the body through
21718 Mind that condition never recurs and you
 have won a point in Science When mentality gives
 rest to the body the next toil will fatigue you less for
21721 you are working out the problem of being in divine meta
 physics and in proportion as you understand the con
 trol which Mind has over socalled matter you will be
21724 able to demonstrate this control The scientific and
 permanent remedy for fatigue is to learn the power of
 Mind over the body or any illusion of physical weariness
21727 and so destroy this illusion for matter cannot be weary
 and heavyladen

 You say Toil fatigues me But what is this me
21730 Is it muscle or mind Which is tired and so speaks
 Without mind could the muscles be tired Do the
 muscles talk or do you talk for them Matter is non
2181 intelligent Mortal mind does the false talking and that
 which affirms weariness made that weariness

 Mind never weary

2183 You do not say a wheel is fatigued and yet the body
 is as material as the wheel If it were not for what the
 human mind says of the body the body like
2186 the inanimate wheel would never be weary
 The consciousness of Truth rests us more than hours of
 repose in unconsciousness

 Coalition of sin and sickness

2189 The body is supposed to say I am ill The reports
 of sickness may form a coalition with the reports of sin
 and say I am malice lust appetite envy
21812 hate What renders both sin and sickness
 difficult of cure is that the human mind is the
 sinner disinclined to selfcorrection and believing that
21815 the body can be sick independently of mortal mind and
 that the divine Mind has no jurisdiction over the body

 Sickness akin to sin

 Why pray for the recovery of the sick if you are with
21818 out faith in Gods willingness and ability to heal them
 If you do believe in God why do you sub
 stitute drugs for the Almightys power and
21821 employ means which lead only into material ways of
 obtaining help instead of turning in time of need to
 God divine Love who is an everpresent help

21824 Treat a belief in sickness as you would sin with sudden
 dismissal Resist the temptation to believe in matter as
 intelligent as having sensation or power

21827 The Scriptures say They that wait upon the Lord
    shall run and not be weary and they shall walk
 and not faint The meaning of that passage is not
21830 perverted by applying it literally to moments of fatigue
 for the moral and physical are as one in their results
 When we wake to the truth of being all disease
2191 pain weakness weariness sorrow sin death will be
 unknown and the mortal dream will forever cease My
2193 method of treating fatigue applies to all bodily ailments
 since Mind should be and is supreme absolute and
 final

 Affirmation and result

2196 In mathematics we do not multiply when we should
 subtract and then say the product is correct No more
 can we say in Science that muscles give strength
2199 that nerves give pain or pleasure or that matter
 governs and then expect that the result will be harmony
 Not muscles nerves nor bones but mortal mind makes
21912 the whole body sick and the whole heart faint whereas
 divine Mind heals

 When this is understood we shall never affirm concern
21915 ing the body what we do not wish to have manifested We
 shall not call the body weak if we would have it strong
 for the belief in feebleness must obtain in the human
21918 mind before it can be made manifest on the body and
 the destruction of the belief will be the removal of its
 effects Science includes no rule of discord but governs
21921 harmoniously The wish says the poet is ever father
 to the thought

 Scientific beginning

 We may hear a sweet melody and yet misunderstand
21924 the science that governs it Those who are healed
 through metaphysical Science not compre
 hending the Principle of the cure may misun
21927 derstand it and impute their recovery to change of air or
 diet not rendering to God the honor due to Him alone
 Entire immunity from the belief in sin suffering and
21930 death may not be reached at this period but we may look
 for an abatement of these evils and this scientific begin
 ning is in the right direction

 Hygiene ineffectual

2201 We hear it said  I exercise daily in the open air I
 take cold baths in order to overcome a predisposition to
2203 take cold and yet I have continual colds
 catarrh and cough Such admissions ought
 to open peoples eyes to the inefficacy of material hygiene
2206 and induce sufferers to look in other directions for cause
 and cure

 Instinct is better than misguided reason as even na
2209 ture declares The violet lifts her blue eye to greet the
 early spring The leaves clap their hands as natures
 untired worshippers The snowbird sings and soars
22012 amid the blasts he has no catarrh from wet feet and
 procures a summer residence with more ease than a na
 bob The atmosphere of the earth kinder than the at
22015 mosphere of mortal mind leaves catarrh to the latter
 Colds coughs and contagion are engendered solely by
 human theories

 The reflex phenomena

22018 Mortal mind produces its own phenomena and then
 charges them to something else  like a kitten
 glancing into the mirror at itself and thinking
22021 it sees another kitten

 A clergyman once adopted a diet of bread and water
 to increase his spirituality Finding his health failing
22024 he gave up his abstinence and advised others never to
 try dietetics for growth in grace

 Volition farreaching

 The belief that either fasting or feasting makes men
22027 better morally or physically is one of the fruits of the
 tree of the knowledge of good and evil con
 cerning which God said Thou shalt not eat
22030 of it Mortal mind forms all conditions of the mortal
 body and controls the stomach bones lungs heart blood
 etc as directly as the volition or will moves the mind

 Starvation and dyspepsia

2211 I knew a person who when quite a child adopted the
 Graham system to cure dyspepsia For many years he
2213 ate only bread and vegetables and drank noth
 ing but water His dyspepsia increasing he
 decided that his diet should be more rigid and
2216 thereafter he partook of but one meal in twentyfour
 hours this meal consisting of only a thin slice of bread
 without water His physician also recommended that
2219 he should not wet his parched throat until three hours
 after eating He passed many weary years in hunger
 and weakness almost in starvation and finally made up
22112 his mind to die having exhausted the skill of the doctors
 who kindly informed him that death was indeed his only
 alternative At this point Christian Science saved him
22115 and he is now in perfect health without a vestige of the
 old complaint

 He learned that suffering and disease were the self
22118 imposed beliefs of mortals and not the facts of being
 that God never decreed disease  never ordained a law
 that fasting should be a means of health Hence semi
22121 starvation is not acceptable to wisdom and it is equally
 far from Science in which being is sustained by God Mind
 These truths opening his eyes relieved his stomach and
22124 he ate without suffering giving God thanks but he
 never enjoyed his food as he had imagined he would
 when still the slave of matter he thought of the flesh
22127 pots of Egypt feeling childhoods hunger and undisci
 plined by selfdenial and divine Science

 Mind and stomach

 This newborn understanding that neither food nor
22130 the stomach without the consent of mortal
 mind can make one suffer brings with it an
 other lesson  that gluttony is a sensual illusion and
2221 that this phantasm of mortal mind disappears as we better
 apprehend our spiritual existence and ascend the ladder
2223 of life

 This person learned that food affects the body only
 as mortal mind has its material methods of working one
2226 of which is to believe that proper food supplies nutriment
 and strength to the human system He learned also that
 mortal mind makes a mortal body whereas Truth re
2229 generates this fleshly mind and feeds thought with the
 bread of Life

 Food had less power to help or to hurt him after he
22212 had availed himself of the fact that Mind governs man
 and he also had less faith in the socalled pleasures and
 pains of matter Taking less thought about what he
22215 should eat or drink consulting the stomach less about
 the economy of living and God more he recovered
 strength and flesh rapidly For many years he had
22218 been kept alive as was believed only by the strictest ad
 herence to hygiene and drugs and yet he continued ill
 all the while Now he dropped drugs and material
22221 hygiene and was well

 He learned that a dyspeptic was very far from being
 the image and likeness of God  far from having do
22224 minion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
 air and over the cattle if eating a bit of animal flesh
 could overpower him He finally concluded that God
22227 never made a dyspeptic while fear hygiene physiology
 and physics had made him one contrary to His commands

 Life only in Spirit

 In seeking a cure for dyspepsia consult matter not at
22230 all and eat what is set before you asking
 no question for conscience sake We must
 destroy the false belief that life and intelligence are in
2231 matter and plant ourselves upon what is pure and per
 fect Paul said Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not
2233 fulfil the lust of the flesh Sooner or later we shall learn
 that the fetters of mans finite capacity are forged by the
 illusion that he lives in body instead of in Soul in matter
2236 instead of in Spirit

 Soul greater than body

 Matter does not express Spirit God is infinite omni
 present Spirit If Spirit is all and is everywhere what
2239 and where is matter Remember that truth
 is greater than error and we cannot put the
 greater into the less Soul is Spirit and Spirit is greater
22312 than body If Spirit were once within the body Spirit
 would be finite and therefore could not be Spirit

 The question of the ages

 The question What is Truth convulses the world
22315 Many are ready to meet this inquiry with the assurance
 which comes of understanding but more are
 blinded by their old illusions and try to give
22318 it pause If the blind lead the blind both shall fall into
 the ditch

 The efforts of error to answer this question by some
22321 ology are vain Spiritual rationality and free thought ac
 company approaching Science and cannot be put down
 They will emancipate humanity and supplant unscientific
22324 means and socalled laws

 Heralds of Science

 Peals that should startle the slumbering thought from
 its erroneous dream are partially unheeded but the last
22327 trump has not sounded or this would not be
 so Marvels calamities and sin will much
 more abound as truth urges upon mortals its resisted
22330 claims but the awful daring of sin destroys sin and
 foreshadows the triumph of truth God will over
 turn until He come whose right it is Longevity
2241 is increasing and the power of sin diminishing for the
 world feels the alterative effect of truth through every
2243 pore

 As the crude footprints of the past disappear from the
 dissolving paths of the present we shall better understand
2246 the Science which governs these changes and shall plant
 our feet on firmer ground Every sensuous pleasure or
 pain is selfdestroyed through suffering There should
2249 be painless progress attended by life and peace instead
 of discord and death

 Sectarianism and opposition

 In the record of nineteen centuries there are sects
22412 many but not enough Christianity Centuries ago re
 ligionists were ready to hail an anthropomor
 phic God and array His vicegerent with pomp
22415 and splendor but this was not the manner
 of truths appearing Of old the cross was truths cen
 tral sign and it is today The modern lash is less
22418 material than the Roman scourge but it is equally as
 cutting Cold disdain stubborn resistance opposition
 from church state laws and the press are still the har
22421 bingers of truths fullorbed appearing

 A higher and more practical Christianity demonstrat
 ing justice and meeting the needs of mortals in sickness
22424 and in health stands at the door of this age knocking
 for admission Will you open or close the door upon this
 angel visitant who cometh in the quiet of meekness as he
22427 came of old to the patriarch at noonday

 Mental emancipation

 Truth brings the elements of liberty On its banner
 is the Soulinspired motto Slavery is abolished The
22430 power of God brings deliverance to the cap
 tive No power can withstand divine Love
 What is this supposed power which opposes itself to God
2251 Whence cometh it What is it that binds man with iron
 shackles to sin sickness and death Whatever enslaves
2253 man is opposed to the divine government Truth makes
 man free

 Truths ordeal

 You may know when first Truth leads by the few
2256 ness and faithfulness of its followers Thus it is that
 the march of time bears onward freedoms
 banner The powers of this world will fight
2259 and will command their sentinels not to let truth pass
 the guard until it subscribes to their systems but Science
 heeding not the pointed bayonet marches on There is
22512 always some tumult but there is a rallying to truths
 standard

 Immortal sentences

 The history of our country like all history illustrates
22515 the might of Mind and shows human power to be propor
 tionate to its embodiment of right thinking A
 few immortal sentences breathing the omnipo
22518 tence of divine justice have been potent to break despotic
 fetters and abolish the whippingpost and slave market
 but oppression neither went down in blood nor did the
22521 breath of freedom come from the cannons mouth Love
 is the liberator

 Slavery abolished

 Legally to abolish unpaid servitude in the United
22524 States was hard but the abolition of mental slavery is
 a more difficult task The despotic tenden
 cies inherent in mortal mind and always ger
22527 minating in new forms of tyranny must be rooted out
 through the action of the divine Mind

 Men and women of all climes and races are still in
22530 bondage to material sense ignorant how to obtain their
 freedom The rights of man were vindicated in a single
 section and on the lowest plane of human life when Afri
2261 can slavery was abolished in our land That was only
 prophetic of further steps towards the banishment of a
2263 worldwide slavery found on higher planes of existence
 and under more subtle and depraving forms

 Libertys crusade

 The voice of God in behalf of the African slave was
2266 still echoing in our land when the voice of the herald of
 this new crusade sounded the keynote of uni
 versal freedom asking a fuller acknowledg
2269 ment of the rights of man as a Son of God demanding
 that the fetters of sin sickness and death be stricken
 from the human mind and that its freedom be won not
22612 through human warfare not with bayonet and blood but
 through Christs divine Science

 Cramping systems

 God has built a higher platform of human rights and
22615 He has built it on diviner claims These claims are not
 made through code or creed but in demonstra
 tion of on earth peace goodwill toward men
22618 Human codes scholastic theology material medicine and
 hygiene fetter faith and spiritual understanding Divine
 Science rends asunder these fetters and mans birthright
22621 of sole allegiance to his Maker asserts itself

 I saw before me the sick wearing out years of servi
 tude to an unreal master in the belief that the body gov
22624 erned them rather than Mind

 House of bondage

 The lame the deaf the dumb the blind the sick the
 sensual the sinner I wished to save from the slavery of
22627 their own beliefs and from the educational
 systems of the Pharaohs who today as of
 yore hold the children of Israel in bondage I saw be
22630 fore me the awful conflict the Red Sea and the wilder
 ness but I pressed on through faith in God trusting
 Truth the strong deliverer to guide me into the land
2271 of Christian Science where fetters fall and the rights of
 man are fully known and acknowledged

 Higher law ends bondage

2273 I saw that the law of mortal belief included all error
 and that even as oppressive laws are disputed and mor
 tals are taught their right to freedom so the
2276 claims of the enslaving senses must be de
 nied and superseded The law of the divine Mind must
 end human bondage or mortals will continue unaware
2279 of mans inalienable rights and in subjection to hope
 less slavery because some public teachers permit
 an ignorance of divine power  an ignorance that
22712 is the foundation of continued bondage and of human
 suffering

 Native freedom

 Discerning the rights of man we cannot fail to fore
22715 see the doom of all oppression Slavery is not the legiti
 mate state of man God made man free
 Paul said I was free born All men should
22718 be free Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is lib
 erty Love and Truth make free but evil and error
 lead into captivity

 Standard of liberty

22721 Christian Science raises the standard of liberty and
 cries Follow me Escape from the bondage of sick
 ness sin and death Jesus marked out the
22724 way Citizens of the world accept the glori
 ous liberty of the children of God and be free This
 is your divine right The illusion of material sense not
22727 divine law has bound you entangled your free limbs
 crippled your capacities enfeebled your body and de
 faced the tablet of your being

22730 If God had instituted material laws to govern man
 disobedience to which would have made man ill Jesus
 would not have disregarded those laws by healing in
2281 direct opposition to them and in defiance of all material
 conditions

 No fleshly heredity

2283 The transmission of disease or of certain idiosyncra
 sies of mortal mind would be impossible if this great fact
 of being were learned  namely that nothing
2286 inharmonious can enter being for Life is God
 Heredity is a prolific subject for mortal belief to pin the
 ories upon but if we learn that nothing is real but the
2289 right we shall have no dangerous inheritances and fleshly
 ills will disappear

 Godgiven dominion

 The enslavement of man is not legitimate It will
22812 cease when man enters into his heritage of freedom his
 Godgiven dominion over the material senses
 Mortals will some day assert their freedom in
22815 the name of Almighty God Then they will control their
 own bodies through the understanding of divine Science
 Dropping their present beliefs they will recognize har
22818 mony as the spiritual reality and discord as the material
 unreality

 If we follow the command of our Master Take no
22821 thought for your life we shall never depend on bodily
 conditions structure or economy but we shall be masters
 of the body dictate its terms and form and control it with
22824 Truth

 Priestly pride humbled

 There is no power apart from God Omnipotence has
 allpower and to acknowledge any other power is to dis
22827 honor God The humble Nazarene overthrew
 the supposition that sin sickness and death
 have power He proved them powerless It should have
22830 humbled the pride of the priests when they saw the dem
 onstration of Christianity excel the influence of their dead
 faith and ceremonies

2291 If Mind is not the master of sin sickness and death
 they are immortal for it is already proved that mat
2293 ter has not destroyed them but is their basis and
 support

 No union of opposites

 We should hesitate to say that Jehovah sins or suffers
2296 but if sin and suffering are realities of being whence did
 they emanate God made all that was made
 and Mind signifies God  infinity not finity
2299 Not far removed from infidelity is the belief which
 unites such opposites as sickness and health holiness
 and unholiness calls both the offspring of spirit and
22912 at the same time admits that Spirit is God  vir
 tually declaring Him good in one instance and evil in
 another

 Selfconstituted law

22915 By universal consent mortal belief has constituted
 itself a law to bind mortals to sickness sin and death
 This customary belief is misnamed material
22918 law and the individual who upholds it is mis
 taken in theory and in practice The socalled law of
 mortal mind conjectural and speculative is made void
22921 by the law of immortal Mind and false law should be
 trampled under foot

 Sickness from mortal mind

 If God causes man to be sick sickness must be good
22924 and its opposite health must be evil for all that He
 makes is good and will stand forever If the
 transgression of Gods law produces sickness it
22927 is right to be sick and we cannot if we would and should
 not if we could annul the decrees of wisdom It is the
 transgression of a belief of mortal mind not of a law of
22930 matter nor of divine Mind which causes the belief of sick
 ness The remedy is Truth not matter  the truth that
 disease is unreal

2301 If sickness is real it belongs to immortality if true
 it is a part of Truth Would you attempt with drugs
2303 or without to destroy a quality or condition of Truth
 But if sickness and sin are illusions the awakening from
 this mortal dream or illusion will bring us into health
2306 holiness and immortality This awakening is the for
 ever coming of Christ the advanced appearing of Truth
 which casts out error and heals the sick This is the sal
2309 vation which comes through God the divine Principle
 Love as demonstrated by Jesus

 God never inconsistent

 It would be contrary to our highest ideas of God to
23012 suppose Him capable of first arranging law and causation
 so as to bring about certain evil results and
 then punishing the helpless victims of His vo
23015 lition for doing what they could not avoid doing Good
 is not cannot be the author of experimental sins God
 good can no more produce sickness than goodness can
23018 cause evil and health occasion disease

 Mental narcotics

 Does wisdom make blunders which must afterwards
 be rectified by man Does a law of God produce sick
23021 ness and can man put that law under his feet
 by healing sickness According to Holy Writ
 the sick are never really healed by drugs hygiene or any
23024 material method These merely evade the question
 They are soothing syrups to put children to sleep satisfy
 mortal belief and quiet fear

 The true healing

23027 We think that we are healed when a disease disap
 pears though it is liable to reappear but we are never
 thoroughly healed until the liability to be
23030 ill is removed Socalled mortal mind or the
 mind of mortals being the remote predisposing and
 the exciting cause of all suffering the cause of disease
2311 must be obliterated through Christ in divine Science or
 the socalled physical senses will get the victory

 Destruction of all evil

2313 Unless an ill is rightly met and fairly overcome by
 Truth the ill is never conquered If God destroys not
 sin sickness and death they are not de
2316 stroyed in the mind of mortals but seem to
 this socalled mind to be immortal What God cannot
 do man need not attempt If God heals not the sick
2319 they are not healed for no lesser power equals the infinite
 Allpower but God Truth Life Love does heal the
 sick through the prayer of the righteous

23112 If God makes sin if good produces evil if truth results
 in error then Science and Christianity are helpless but
 there are no antagonistic powers nor laws spiritual or
23115 material creating and governing man through perpetual
 warfare God is not the author of mortal discords
 Therefore we accept the conclusion that discords have
23118 only a fabulous existence are mortal beliefs which divine
 Truth and Love destroy

 Superiority to sickness and sin

 To hold yourself superior to sin because God made
23121 you superior to it and governs man is true wisdom To
 fear sin is to misunderstand the power of Love
 and the divine Science of being in mans rela
23124 tion to God  to doubt His government and
 distrust His omnipotent care To hold yourself superior
 to sickness and death is equally wise and is in accordance
23127 with divine Science To fear them is impossible when
 you fully apprehend God and know that they are no part
 of His creation

23130 Man governed by his Maker having no other Mind 
 planted on the Evangelists statement that all things
 were made by Him the Word of God and without
2321 Him was not anything made that was made  can
 triumph over sin sickness and death

 Denials of divine power

2323 Many theories relative to God and man neither make
 man harmonious nor God lovable The beliefs we com
 monly entertain about happiness and life
2326 afford no scatheless and permanent evidence
 of either Security for the claims of harmonious and
 eternal being is found only in divine Science

2329 Scripture informs us that with God all things are
 possible  all good is possible to Spirit but our prev
 alent theories practically deny this and make healing
23212 possible only through matter These theories must be
 untrue for the Scripture is true Christianity is not
 false but religions which contradict its Principle are
23215 false

 In our age Christianity is again demonstrating the
 power of divine Principle as it did over nineteen hun
23218 dred years ago by healing the sick and triumphing over
 death Jesus never taught that drugs food air and ex
 ercise could make a man healthy or that they could de
23221 stroy human life nor did he illustrate these errors by his
 practice He referred mans harmony to Mind not to
 matter and never tried to make of none effect the sen
23224 tence of God which sealed Gods condemnation of sin
 sickness and death

 Signs following

 In the sacred sanctuary of Truth are voices of sol
23227 emn import but we heed them not It is only when the
 socalled pleasures and pains of sense pass
 away in our lives that we find unquestion
23230 able signs of the burial of error and the resurrection to
 spiritual life

 Profession and proof

 There is neither place nor opportunity in Science for error
2331 of any sort Every day makes its demands upon us for
 higher proofs rather than professions of Christian power
2333 These proofs consist solely in the destruction
 of sin sickness and death by the power of
 Spirit as Jesus destroyed them This is an element of
2336 progress and progress is the law of God whose law de
 mands of us only what we can certainly fulfil

 Perfection gained slowly

 In the midst of imperfection perfection is seen and
2339 acknowledged only by degrees The ages must slowly
 work up to perfection How long it must be
 before we arrive at the demonstration of scien
23312 tific being no man knoweth  not even the
 Son but the Father but the false claim of error con
 tinues its delusions until the goal of goodness is assidu
23315 ously earned and won

 Christs mission

 Already the shadow of His right hand rests upon the
 hour Ye who can discern the face of the sky  the
23318 sign material  how much more should ye
 discern the sign mental and compass the de
 struction of sin and sickness by overcoming the thoughts
23321 which produce them and by understanding the spiritual
 idea which corrects and destroys them To reveal this
 truth was our Masters mission to all mankind including
23324 the hearts which rejected him

 Efficacy of truth

 When numbers have been divided according to a fixed
 rule the quotient is not more unquestionable than the
23327 scientific tests I have made of the effects of
 truth upon the sick The counter fact rela
 tive to any disease is required to cure it The utterance
23330 of truth is designed to rebuke and destroy error Why
 should truth not be efficient in sickness which is solely
 the result of inharmony

2341 Spiritual draughts heal while material lotions interfere
 with truth even as ritualism and creed hamper spirit
2343 uality If we trust matter we distrust Spirit

 Crumbs of comfort

 Whatever inspires with wisdom Truth or Love  be
 it song sermon or Science  blesses the human family
2346 with crumbs of comfort from Christs table
 feeding the hungry and giving living waters to
 the thirsty

 Hospitality to health and good

2349 We should become more familiar with good than with
 evil and guard against false beliefs as watchfully as we
 bar our doors against the approach of thieves
23412 and murderers We should love our enemies
 and help them on the basis of the Golden
 Rule but avoid casting pearls before those who trample
23415 them under foot thereby robbing both themselves and
 others

 Cleansing the mind

 If mortals would keep proper ward over mortal mind
23418 the brood of evils which infest it would be cleared out
 We must begin with this socalled mind and
 empty it of sin and sickness or sin and sick
23421 ness will never cease The present codes of human
 systems disappoint the weary searcher after a divine
 theology adequate to the right education of human
23424 thought

 Sin and disease must be thought before they can be
 manifested You must control evil thoughts in the first
23427 instance or they will control you in the second Jesus
 declared that to look with desire on forbidden objects was
 to break a moral precept He laid great stress on the
23430 action of the human mind unseen to the senses

 Evil thoughts and aims reach no farther and do no more
 harm than ones belief permits Evil thoughts lusts and
2351 malicious purposes cannot go forth like wandering pollen
 from one human mind to another finding unsuspected
2353 lodgment if virtue and truth build a strong defence
 Better suffer a doctor infected with smallpox to attend
 you than to be treated mentally by one who does not obey
2356 the requirements of divine Science

 Teachers functions

 The teachers of schools and the readers in churches
 should be selected with as direct reference to their
2359 morals as to their learning or their correct
 reading Nurseries of character should be
 strongly garrisoned with virtue Schoolexaminations are
23512 onesided it is not so much academic education as a
 moral and spiritual culture which lifts one higher The
 pure and uplifting thoughts of the teacher constantly
23515 imparted to pupils will reach higher than the heavens of
 astronomy while the debased and unscrupulous mind
 though adorned with gems of scholarly attainment will
23518 degrade the characters it should inform and elevate

 Physicians privilege

 Physicians whom the sick employ in their helplessness
 should be models of virtue They should be wise spir
23521 itual guides to health and hope To the trem
 blers on the brink of death who understand
 not the divine Truth which is Life and perpetuates being
23524 physicians should be able to teach it Then when the soul
 is willing and the flesh weak the patients feet may be
 planted on the rock Christ Jesus the true idea of spiritual
23527 power

 Clergymens duty

 Clergymen occupying the watchtowers of the world
 should uplift the standard of Truth They should so raise
23530 their hearers spiritually that their listeners
 will love to grapple with a new right idea
 and broaden their concepts Love of Christianity rather
2361 than love of popularity should stimulate clerical labor
 and progress Truth should emanate from the pulpit
2363 but never be strangled there A special privilege is vested
 in the ministry How shall it be used Sacredly in the
 interests of humanity not of sect

2366 Is it not professional reputation and emolument rather
 than the dignity of Gods laws which many leaders seek
 Do not inferior motives induce the infuriated attacks on
2369 individuals who reiterate Christs teachings in support
 of his proof by example that the divine Mind heals sick
 ness as well as sin

 A mothers responsibility

23612 A mother is the strongest educator either for or
 against crime Her thoughts form the embryo of an
 other mortal mind and unconsciously mould
23615 it either after a model odious to herself or
 through divine influence according to the pattern
 showed to thee in the mount Hence the importance
23618 of Christian Science from which we learn of the one
 Mind and of the availability of good as the remedy for
 every woe

 Childrens tractability

23621 Children should obey their parents insubordination
 is an evil blighting the buddings of selfgovernment
 Parents should teach their children at the
23624 earliest possible period the truths of health
 and holiness Children are more tractable than adults
 and learn more readily to love the simple verities that will
23627 make them happy and good

 Jesus loved little children because of their freedom
 from wrong and their receptiveness of right While
23630 age is halting between two opinions or battling with
 false beliefs youth makes easy and rapid strides towards
 Truth

2371 A little girl who had occasionally listened to my ex
 planations badly wounded her finger She seemed not
2373 to notice it On being questioned about it she answered
 ingenuously There is no sensation in matter Bound
 ing off with laughing eyes she presently added Mamma
2376 my finger is not a bit sore

 Soil and seed

 It might have been months or years before her parents
 would have laid aside their drugs or reached the mental
2379 height their little daughter so naturally at
 tained The more stubborn beliefs and theo
 ries of parents often choke the good seed in the minds of
23712 themselves and their offspring Superstition like the
 fowls of the air snatches away the good seed before it
 has sprouted

 Teaching children

23715 Children should be taught the Truthcure Christian
 Science among their first lessons and kept from discuss
 ing or entertaining theories or thoughts about
23718 sickness To prevent the experience of error
 and its sufferings keep out of the minds of your children
 either sinful or diseased thoughts The latter should
23721 be excluded on the same principle as the former This
 makes Christian Science early available

 Deluded invalids

 Some invalids are unwilling to know the facts or to
23724 hear about the fallacy of matter and its supposed laws
 They devote themselves a little longer to their
 material gods cling to a belief in the life and
23727 intelligence of matter and expect this error to do more
 for them than they are willing to admit the only living and
 true God can do Impatient at your explanation unwill
23730 ing to investigate the Science of Mind which would rid
 them of their complaints they hug false beliefs and suffer
 the delusive consequences

 Patient waiting

2381 Motives and acts are not rightly valued before they are
 understood It is well to wait till those whom you would
2383 benefit are ready for the blessing for Science
 is working changes in personal character as
 well as in the material universe
2386 To obey the Scriptural command Come out from
 among them and be ye separate is to incur societys
 frown but this frown more than flatteries enables one
2389 to be Christian Losing her crucifix the Roman Catholic
 girl said I have nothing left but Christ If God be
 for us who can be against us

 Unimproved opportunities

23812 To fall away from Truth in times of persecution shows
 that we never understood Truth From out the bridal
 chamber of wisdom there will come the warn
23815 ing I know you not Unimproved op
 portunities will rebuke us when we attempt to claim the
 benefits of an experience we have not made our own try
23818 to reap the harvest we have not sown and wish to enter
 unlawfully into the labors of others Truth often remains
 unsought until we seek this remedy for human woe be
23821 cause we suffer severely from error

 Attempts to conciliate society and so gain dominion over
 mankind arise from worldly weakness He who leaves
23824 all for Christ forsakes popularity and gains Christianity

 Society and intolerance

 Society is a foolish juror listening only to one side of
 the case Justice often comes too late to secure a verdict
23827 People with mental work before them have
 no time for gossip about false law or testimony
 To reconstruct timid justice and place the fact above the
23830 falsehood is the work of time

 The cross is the central emblem of history It is the
 lodestar in the demonstration of Christian healing  the
2391 demonstration by which sin and sickness are destroyed
 The sects which endured the lash of their predecessors
2393 in their turn lay it upon those who are in advance of
 creeds

 Right views of humanity

 Take away wealth fame and social organizations
2396 which weigh not one jot in the balance of God and we
 get clearer views of Principle Break up
 cliques level wealth with honesty let worth
2399 be judged according to wisdom and we get better views
 of humanity

 The wicked man is not the ruler of his upright
23912 neighbor Let it be understood that success in error is
 defeat in Truth The watchword of Christian Science
 is Scriptural Let the wicked forsake his way and the
23915 unrighteous man his thoughts

 Standpoint revealed

 To ascertain our progress we must learn where our
 affections are placed and whom we acknowledge and
23918 obey as God If divine Love is becoming
 nearer dearer and more real to us matter is
 then submitting to Spirit The objects we pursue and
23921 the spirit we manifest reveal our standpoint and show
 what we are winning

 Antagonistic sources

 Mortal mind is the acknowledged seat of human mo
23924 tives It forms material concepts and produces every
 discordant action of the body If action pro
 ceeds from the divine Mind action is harmo
23927 nious If it comes from erring mortal mind it is discord
 ant and ends in sin sickness death Those two opposite
 sources never mingle in fount or stream The perfect
23930 Mind sends forth perfection for God is Mind Imper
 fect mortal mind sends forth its own resemblances of
 which the wise man said All is vanity

 Some lessons from nature

2401 Nature voices natural spiritual law and divine Love
 but human belief misinterprets nature Arctic regions
2403 sunny tropics giant hills winged winds
 mighty billows verdant vales festive flowers
 and glorious heavens  all point to Mind the spiritual
2406 intelligence they reflect The floral apostles are hiero
 glyphs of Deity Suns and planets teach grand lessons
 The stars make night beautiful and the leaflet turns nat
2409 urally towards the light

 Perpetual motions

 In the order of Science in which the Principle is above
 what it reflects all is one grand concord Change this
24012 statement suppose Mind to be governed by
 matter or Soul in body and you lose the key
 note of being and there is continual discord Mind is
24015 perpetual motion Its symbol is the sphere The rota
 tions and revolutions of the universe of Mind go on
 eternally

 Progress demanded

24018 Mortals move onward towards good or evil as time
 glides on If mortals are not progressive past failures
 will be repeated until all wrong work is ef
24021 faced or rectified If at present satisfied with
 wrongdoing we must learn to loathe it If at present
 content with idleness we must become dissatisfied with
24024 it Remember that mankind must sooner or later either
 by suffering or by Science be convinced of the error that
 is to be overcome

24027 In trying to undo the errors of sense one must pay fully
 and fairly the utmost farthing until all error is finally
 brought into subjection to Truth The divine method
24030 of paying sins wages involves unwinding ones snarls
 and learning from experience how to divide between sense
 and Soul

2411 Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth He who
 knows Gods will or the demands of divine Science and
2413 obeys them incurs the hostility of envy and he who
 refuses obedience to God is chastened by Love

 The doom of sin

 Sensual treasures are laid up where moth and rust
2416 doth corrupt Mortality is their doom Sin breaks in
 upon them and carries off their fleeting joys
 The sensualists affections are as imaginary
2419 whimsical and unreal as his pleasures Falsehood envy
 hypocrisy malice hate revenge and so forth steal away
 the treasures of Truth Stripped of its coverings what
24112 a mocking spectacle is sin

 Spirit transforms

 The Bible teaches transformation of the body by the
 renewal of Spirit Take away the spiritual signification
24115 of Scripture and that compilation can do no
 more for mortals than can moonbeams to melt
 a river of ice The error of the ages is preaching without
24118 practice

 The substance of all devotion is the reflection and
 demonstration of divine Love healing sickness and
24121 destroying sin Our Master said If ye love me keep
 my commandments

 Ones aim a point beyond faith should be to find the
24124 footsteps of Truth the way to health and holiness We
 should strive to reach the Horeb height where God is re
 vealed and the cornerstone of all spiritual building is
24127 purity The baptism of Spirit washing the body of all
 the impurities of flesh signifies that the pure in heart
 see God and are approaching spiritual Life and its
24130 demonstration

 Spiritual baptism

 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
 needle than for sinful beliefs to enter the kingdom of
2421 heaven eternal harmony Through repentance spiritual
 baptism and regeneration mortals put off their material
2423 beliefs and false individuality It is only a
 question of time when they shall all know
 Me God from the least of them unto the greatest
2426 Denial of the claims of matter is a great step towards
 the joys of Spirit towards human freedom and the final
 triumph over the body

 The one only way

2429 There is but one way to heaven harmony and Christ
 in divine Science shows us this way It is to know no
 other reality  to have no other conscious
24212 ness of life  than good God and His reflec
 tion and to rise superior to the socalled pain and pleasure
 of the senses

24215 Selflove is more opaque than a solid body In pa
 tient obedience to a patient God let us labor to dis
 solve with the universal solvent of Love the adamant
24218 of error  selfwill selfjustification and selflove 
 which wars against spirituality and is the law of sin
 and death

 Divided vestments

24221 The vesture of Life is Truth According to the Bible
 the facts of being are commonly misconstrued for it is
 written They parted my raiment among
24224 them and for my vesture they did cast lots
 The divine Science of man is woven into one web of
 consistency without seam or rent Mere speculation or
24227 superstition appropriates no part of the divine vesture
 while inspiration restores every part of the Christly gar
 ment of righteousness

24230 The fingerposts of divine Science show the way our
 Master trod and require of Christians the proof which
 he gave instead of mere profession We may hide
2431 spiritual ignorance from the world but we can never
 succeed in the Science and demonstration of spiritual
2433 good through ignorance or hypocrisy

 Ancient and modern miracles

 The divine Love which made harmless the poisonous
 viper which delivered men from the boiling oil from
2436 the fiery furnace from the jaws of the lion
 can heal the sick in every age and triumph
 over sin and death It crowned the demon
2439 strations of Jesus with unsurpassed power and love But
 the same Mind    which was also in Christ Jesus
 must always accompany the letter of Science in order to
24312 confirm and repeat the ancient demonstrations of prophets
 and apostles That those wonders are not more com
 monly repeated today arises not so much from lack of
24315 desire as from lack of spiritual growth

 Mental telegraphy

 The clay cannot reply to the potter The head heart
 lungs and limbs do not inform us that they are dizzy
24318 diseased consumptive or lame If this in
 formation is conveyed mortal mind conveys
 it Neither immortal and unerring Mind nor matter
24321 the inanimate substratum of mortal mind can carry
 on such telegraphy for God is of purer eyes than
 to behold evil and matter has neither intelligence nor
24324 sensation

 Annihilation of error

 Truth has no consciousness of error Love has no
 sense of hatred Life has no partnership
24327 with death Truth Life and Love are a law
 of annihilation to everything unlike themselves because
 they declare nothing except God

 Deformity and perfection

24330 Sickness sin and death are not the fruits of Life
 They are inharmonies which Truth destroys Perfection
 does not animate imperfection Inasmuch as God is
2441 good and the fount of all being He does not produce
 moral or physical deformity therefore such deformity is
2443 not real but is illusion the mirage of error
 Divine Science reveals these grand facts On
 their basis Jesus demonstrated Life never
2446 fearing nor obeying error in any form

 If we were to derive all our conceptions of man from
 what is seen between the cradle and the grave happi
2449 ness and goodness would have no abidingplace in man
 and the worms would rob him of the flesh but Paul
 writes The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
24412 made me free from the law of sin and death

 Man never less than man

 Man undergoing birth maturity and decay is like the
 beasts and vegetables  subject to laws of decay If
24415 man were dust in his earliest stage of exist
 ence we might admit the hypothesis that he
 returns eventually to his primitive condition
24418 but man was never more nor less than man

 If man flickers out in death or springs from matter into
 being there must be an instant when God is without His
24421 entire manifestation  when there is no full reflection
 of the infinite Mind

 Man not evolved

 Man in Science is neither young nor old He has
24424 neither birth nor death He is not a beast a vegetable
 nor a migratory mind He does not pass from
 matter to Mind from the mortal to the im
24427 mortal from evil to good or from good to evil Such
 admissions cast us headlong into darkness and dogma
 Even Shakespeares poetry pictures age as infancy as
24430 helplessness and decadence instead of assigning to man
 the everlasting grandeur and immortality of development
 power and prestige

2451 The error of thinking that we are growing old and the
 benefits of destroying that illusion are illustrated in a
2453 sketch from the history of an English woman published
 in the London medical magazine called The Lancet

 Perpetual youth

 Disappointed in love in her early years she became
2456 insane and lost all account of time Believing that she
 was still living in the same hour which parted
 her from her lover taking no note of years
2459 she stood daily before the window watching for her
 lovers coming In this mental state she remained young
 Having no consciousness of time she literally grew no
24512 older Some American travellers saw her when she was
 seventyfour and supposed her to be a young woman
 She had no carelined face no wrinkles nor gray hair but
24515 youth sat gently on cheek and brow Asked to guess her
 age those unacquainted with her history conjectured that
 she must be under twenty

24518 This instance of youth preserved furnishes a useful
 hint upon which a Franklin might work with more cer
 tainty than when he coaxed the enamoured lightning
24521 from the clouds Years had not made her old because
 she had taken no cognizance of passing time nor thought
 of herself as growing old The bodily results of her belief
24524 that she was young manifested the influence of such a be
 lief She could not age while believing herself young for
 the mental state governed the physical

24527 Impossibilities never occur One instance like the
 foregoing proves it possible to be young at seventyfour
 and the primary of that illustration makes it plain that
24530 decrepitude is not according to law nor is it a necessity of
 nature but an illusion

 Man reflects God

 The infinite never began nor will it ever end Mind
2461 and its formations can never be annihilated Man is not
 a pendulum swinging between evil and good joy and
2463 sorrow sickness and health life and death
 Life and its faculties are not measured by
 calendars The perfect and immortal are the eternal
2466 likeness of their Maker Man is by no means a material
 germ rising from the imperfect and endeavoring to reach
 Spirit above his origin The stream rises no higher than
2469 its source

 The measurement of life by solar years robs youth and
 gives ugliness to age The radiant sun of virtue and truth
24612 coexists with being Manhood is its eternal noon un
 dimmed by a declining sun As the physical and mate
 rial the transient sense of beauty fades the radiance of
24615 Spirit should dawn upon the enraptured sense with bright
 and imperishable glories

 Undesirable records

 Never record ages Chronological data are no part
24618 of the vast forever Timetables of birth and death are
 so many conspiracies against manhood and
 womanhood Except for the error of meas
24621 uring and limiting all that is good and beautiful man
 would enjoy more than threescore years and ten and
 still maintain his vigor freshness and promise Man
24624 governed by immortal Mind is always beautiful and
 grand Each succeeding year unfolds wisdom beauty
 and holiness

 True life eternal

24627 Life is eternal We should find this out and begin the
 demonstration thereof Life and goodness are immortal
 Let us then shape our views of existence into
24630 loveliness freshness and continuity rather
 than into age and blight

 Acute and chronic beliefs reproduce their own types
2471 The acute belief of physical life comes on at a remote
 period and is not so disastrous as the chronic belief

 Eyes and teeth renewed

2473 I have seen age regain two of the elements it had lost
 sight and teeth A woman of eightyfive whom I knew
 had a return of sight Another woman at
2476 ninety had new teeth incisors cuspids bi
 cuspids and one molar One man at sixty
 had retained his full set of upper and lower teeth without
2479 a decaying cavity

 Eternal beauty

 Beauty as well as truth is eternal but the beauty
 of material things passes away fading and fleeting as
24712 mortal belief Custom education and fashion
 form the transient standards of mortals Im
 mortality exempt from age or decay has a glory of its
24715 own  the radiance of Soul Immortal men and women
 are models of spiritual sense drawn by perfect Mind
 and reflecting those higher conceptions of loveliness
24718 which transcend all material sense

 The divine loveliness

 Comeliness and grace are independent of matter Be
 ing possesses its qualities before they are perceived hu
24721 manly Beauty is a thing of life which
 dwells forever in the eternal Mind and re
 flects the charms of His goodness in expression form
24724 outline and color It is Love which paints the petal
 with myriad hues glances in the warm sunbeam arches
 the cloud with the bow of beauty blazons the night with
24727 starry gems and covers earth with loveliness

 The embellishments of the person are poor substitutes
 for the charms of being shining resplendent and eternal
24730 over age and decay

 The recipe for beauty is to have less illusion and
 more Soul to retreat from the belief of pain or pleasure
2481 in the body into the unchanging calm and glorious free
 dom of spiritual harmony

 Loves endowment

2483 Love never loses sight of loveliness Its halo rests upon
 its object One marvels that a friend can ever seem less
 than beautiful Men and women of riper
2486 years and larger lessons ought to ripen into
 health and immortality instead of lapsing into darkness
 or gloom Immortal Mind feeds the body with supernal
2489 freshness and fairness supplying it with beautiful images
 of thought and destroying the woes of sense which each
 day brings to a nearer tomb

 Mental sculpture

24812 The sculptor turns from the marble to his model in
 order to perfect his conception We are all sculptors
 working at various forms moulding and chisel
24815 ing thought What is the model before mortal
 mind Is it imperfection joy sorrow sin suffering
 Have you accepted the mortal model Are you repro
24818 ducing it Then you are haunted in your work by vicious
 sculptors and hideous forms Do you not hear from all
 mankind of the imperfect model The world is holding
24821 it before your gaze continually The result is that you
 are liable to follow those lower patterns limit your life
 work and adopt into your experience the angular outline
24824 and deformity of matter models

 Perfect models

 To remedy this we must first turn our gaze in the right
 direction and then walk that way We must form perfect
24827 models in thought and look at them continually
 or we shall never carve them out in grand and
 noble lives Let unselfishness goodness mercy justice
24830 health holiness love  the kingdom of heaven  reign
 within us and sin disease and death will diminish until
 they finally disappear

2491 Let us accept Science relinquish all theories based on
 sensetestimony give up imperfect models and illusive
2493 ideals and so let us have one God one Mind and that
 one perfect producing His own models of excellence

 Renewed selfhood

 Let the male and female of Gods creating appear
2496 Let us feel the divine energy of Spirit bringing us into
 newness of life and recognizing no mortal nor
 material power as able to destroy Let us re
2499 joice that we are subject to the divine powers that be
 Such is the true Science of being Any other theory of
 Life or God is delusive and mythological

24912 Mind is not the author of matter and the creator of
 ideas is not the creator of illusions Either there is no
 omnipotence or omnipotence is the only power God is
24915 the infinite and infinity never began will never end and
 includes nothing unlike God Whence then is soulless
 matter

 Illusive dreams

24918 Life is like Christ the same yesterday and today
 and forever Organization and time have nothing to do
 with Life You say I dreamed last night
24921 What a mistake is that The I is Spirit God
 never slumbers and His likeness never dreams Mortals
 are the Adam dreamers

24924 Sleep and apath are phases of the dream that life sub
 stance and intelligence are material The mortal night
 dream is sometimes nearer the fact of being than are the
24927 thoughts of mortals when awake The nightdream has
 less matter as its accompaniment It throws off some
 material fetters It falls short of the skies but makes its
24930 mundane flights quite ethereal

 Philosophical blunders

 Man is the reflection of Soul He is the direct oppo
 site of material sensation and there is but one Ego We
2501 run into error when we divide Soul into souls multiply
 Mind into minds and suppose error to be mind then mind
2503 to be in matter and matter to be a lawgiver
 unintelligence to act like intelligence and mor
 tality to be the matrix of immortality

 Spirit the one Ego

2506 Mortal existence is a dream mortal existence has no
 real entity but saith It is I Spirit is the Ego which
 never dreams but understands all things
2509 which never errs and is ever conscious which
 never believes but knows which is never born and
 never dies Spiritual man is the likeness of this Ego
25012 Man is not God but like a ray of light which comes from
 the sun man the outcome of God reflects God

 Mortal existence a dream

 Mortal body and mind are one and that one is called
25015 man but a mortal is not man for man is immortal A
 mortal may be weary or pained enjoy or suffer
 according to the dream he entertains in sleep
25018 When that dream vanishes the mortal finds himself
 experiencing none of these dreamsensations To the
 observer the body lies listless undisturbed and sensa
25021 tionless and the mind seems to be absent

 Now I ask Is there any more reality in the waking
 dream of mortal existence than in the sleeping dream
25024 There cannot be since whatever appears to be a mortal
 man is a mortal dream Take away the mortal mind
 and matter has no more sense as a man than it has as
25027 a tree But the spiritual real man is immortal

 Upon this stage of existence goes on the dance of mortal
 mind Mortal thoughts chase one another like snowflakes
25030 and drift to the ground Science reveals Life as not being
 at the mercy of death nor will Science admit that happi
 ness is ever the sport of circumstance

 Error selfdestroyed

2511 Error is not real hence it is not more imperative
 as it hastens towards selfdestruction The socalled
2513 belief of mortal mind apparent as an abscess
 should not grow more painful before it suppu
 rates neither should a fever become more severe before
2516 it ends

 Illusion of death

 Fright is so great at certain stages of mortal belief
 as to drive belief into new paths In the illusion of
2519 death mortals wake to the knowledge of two
 facts 1 that they are not dead 2 that
 they have but passed the portals of a new belief Truth
25112 works out the nothingness of error in just these ways
 Sickness as well as sin is an error that Christ Truth
 alone can destroy

 Mortal minds disappearance

25115 We must learn how mankind govern the body 
 whether through faith in hygiene in drugs or in will
 power We should learn whether they govern
25118 the body through a belief in the necessity of
 sickness and death sin and pardon or govern
 it from the higher understanding that the divine Mind
25121 makes perfect acts upon the socalled human mind
 through truth leads the human mind to relinquish all
 error to find the divine Mind to be the only Mind
25124 and the healer of sin disease death This process of
 higher spiritual understanding improves mankind until
 error disappears and nothing is left which deserves to
25127 perish or to be punished

 Spiritual ignorance

 Ignorance like intentional wrong is not Science
 Ignorance must be seen and corrected before we can at
25130 tain harmony Inharmonious beliefs which
 rob Mind calling it matter and deify their
 own notions imprison themselves in what they create
2521 They are at war with Science and as our Master said
 If a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom
2523 cannot stand

 Human ignorance of Mind and of the recuperative
 energies of Truth occasions the only skepticism regard
2526 ing the pathology and theology of Christian Science

 Eternal man recognized

 When false human beliefs learn even a little of their
 own falsity they begin to disappear A knowledge of
2529 error and of its operations must precede that
 understanding of Truth which destroys error
 until the entire mortal material error finally disappears
25212 and the eternal verity man created by and of Spirit
 is understood and recognized as the true likeness of his
 Maker

25215 The false evidence of material sense contrasts strikingly
 with the testimony of Spirit Material sense lifts its voice
 with the arrogance of reality and says

 Testimony of sense

25218 I am wholly dishonest and no man knoweth it I can
 cheat lie commit adultery rob murder and I elude
 detection by smoothtongued villainy Ani
25221 mal in propensity deceitful in sentiment
 fraudulent in purpose I mean to make my short span
 of life one gala day What a nice thing is sin How
25224 sin succeeds where the good purpose waits The world
 is my kingdom I am enthroned in the gorgeousness
 of matter But a touch an accident the law of God
25227 may at any moment annihilate my peace for all my
 fancied joys are fatal Like bursting lava I expand but
 to my own despair and shine with the resplendency of
25230 consuming fire

 Testimony of Soul

 Spirit bearing opposite testimony saith

 I am Spirit Man whose senses are spiritual is my
2531 likeness He reflects the infinite understanding for I am
 Infinity The beauty of holiness the perfection of being
2533 imperishable glory  all are Mine for I am
 God I give immortality to man for I am
 Truth I include and impart all bliss for I am Love
2536 I give life without beginning and without end for I am
 Life I am supreme and give all for I am Mind I am
 the substance of all because I AM THAT I AM

 Heavenbestowed prerogative

2539 I hope dear reader I am leading you into the under
 standing of your divine rights your heavenbestowed har
 mony  that as you read you see there is no
25312 cause outside of erring mortal material sense
 which is not power able to make you sick or
 sinful and I hope that you are conquering this false sense
25315 Knowing the falsity of socalled material sense you can
 assert your prerogative to overcome the belief in sin dis
 ease or death

 Right endeavor possible

25318 If you believe in and practise wrong knowingly you
 can at once change your course and do right Matter can
 make no opposition to right endeavors against
25321 sin or sickness for matter is inert mindless
 Also if you believe yourself diseased you can
 alter this wrong belief and action without hindrance from
25324 the body

 Do not believe in any supposed necessity for sin dis
 ease or death knowing as you ought to know that God
25327 never requires obedience to a socalled material law for
 no such law exists The belief in sin and death is de
 stroyed by the law of God which is the law of Life in
25330 stead of death of harmony instead of discord of Spirit
 instead of the flesh

 Patience and final perfection

 The divine demand Be ye therefore perfect is sci
2541 entific and the human footsteps leading to perfection are
 indispensable Individuals are consistent who watching
2543 and praying can run and not be weary   
 walk and not faint who gain good rapidly
 and hold their position or attain slowly and
2546 yield not to discouragement God requires perfection
 but not until the battle between Spirit and flesh is fought
 and the victory won To stop eating drinking or being
2549 clothed materially before the spiritual facts of existence
 are gained step by step is not legitimate When we wait
 patiently on God and seek Truth righteously He directs
25412 our path Imperfect mortals grasp the ultimate of spir
 itual perfection slowly but to begin aright and to con
 tinue the strife of demonstrating the great problem of
25415 being is doing much

 During the sensual ages absolute Christian Science
 may not be achieved prior to the change called death
25418 for we have not the power to demonstrate what we do
 not understand But the human self must be evangel
 ized This task God demands us to accept lovingly
25421 today and to abandon so fast as practical the material
 and to work out the spiritual which determines the out
 ward and actual

25424 If you venture upon the quiet surface of error and are
 in sympathy with error what is there to disturb the waters
 What is there to strip off errors disguise

 The cross and crown

25427 If you launch your bark upon the everagitated but
 healthful waters of truth you will encounter storms
 Your good will be evil spoken of This is the
25430 cross Take it up and bear it for through it
 you win and wear the crown Pilgrim on earth thy home
 is heaven stranger thou art the guest of God




 CHAPTER IX  CREATION

 Thy throne is established of old
 Thou art from everlasting  PSALMS

 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
 in pain together until now And not only they but ourselves
 also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we
 ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption
 to wit the redemption of our body  PAUL

 Inadequate theories of creation

2551 ETERNAL Truth is changing the universe As mor
 tals drop off their mental swaddlingclothes thought
2553 expands into expression Let there be light
 is the perpetual demand of Truth and Love
 changing chaos into order and discord into the
2556 music of the spheres The mythical human theories of
 creation anciently classified as the higher criticism sprang
 from cultured scholars in Rome and in Greece but they
2559 afforded no foundation for accurate views of creation by
 the divine Mind

 Finite views of Deity

 Mortal man has made a covenant with his eyes to be
25512 little Deity with human conceptions In league
 with material sense mortals take limited views
 of all things That God is corporeal or material no man
25515 should affirm

 The human form or physical finiteness cannot be
 made the basis of any true idea of the infinite Godhead
25518 Eye hath not seen Spirit nor hath ear heard His voice

 No material creation

2561 Progress takes off human shackles The finite must
 yield to the infinite Advancing to a higher plane of ac
2563 tion thought rises from the material sense to
 the spiritual from the scholastic to the in
 spirational and from the mortal to the immortal All
2566 things are created spiritually Mind not matter is the
 creator Love the divine Principle is the Father and
 Mother of the universe including man

 Tritheism impossible

2569 The theory of three persons in one God that is a per
 sonal Trinity or Triunity suggests polythe
 ism rather than the one everpresent I AM
25612 Hear O Israel the Lord our God is one Lord

 No divine corporeality

 The everlasting I AM is not bounded nor compressed
 within the narrow limits of physical humanity nor can
25615 He be understood aright through mortal con
 cepts The precise form of God must be of
 small importance in comparison with the sublime ques
25618 tion What is infinite Mind or divine Love

 Who is it that demands our obedience He who in
 the language of Scripture doeth according to His will
25621 in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the
 earth and none can stay His hand or say unto Him
 What doest Thou

25624 No form nor physical combination is adequate to rep
 resent infinite Love A finite and material sense of God
 leads to formalism and narrowness it chills the spirit of
25627 Christianity

 Limitless Mind

 A limitless Mind cannot proceed from physical limita
 tions Finiteness cannot present the idea or the vast
25630 ness of infinity A mind originating from a
 finite or material source must be limited and
 finite Infinite Mind is the creator and creation is the
2571 infinite image or idea emanating from this Mind If
 Mind is within and without all things then all is Mind
2573 and this definition is scientific

 Matter is not substance

 If matter socalled is substance then Spirit matters
 unlikeness must be shadow and shadow cannot produce
2576 substance The theory that Spirit is not the
 only substance and creator is pantheistic het
 erodoxy which ultimates in sickness sin and death it is
2579 the belief in a bodily soul and a material mind a soul
 governed by the body and a mind in matter This be
 lief is shallow pantheism

25712 Mind creates His own likeness in ideas and the sub
 stance of an idea is very far from being the supposed sub
 stance of nonintelligent matter Hence the Father Mind
25715 is not the father of matter The material senses and
 human conceptions would translate spiritual ideas into
 material beliefs and would say that an anthropomorphic
25718 God instead of infinite Principle  in other words divine
 Love  is the father of the rain who hath begotten the
 drops of dew who bringeth forth Mazzaroth in his sea
25721 son and guideth Arcturus with his sons

 Inexhaustible divine Love

 Finite mind manifests all sorts of errors and thus
 proves the material theory of mind in matter to be the
25724 antipode of Mind Who hath found finite life
 or love sufficient to meet the demands of human
 want and woe  to still the desires to satisfy the aspira
25727 tions Infinite Mind cannot be limited to a finite form
 or Mind would lose its infinite character as inexhaustible
 Love eternal Life omnipotent Truth

 Infinite physique impossible

25730 It would require an infinite form to contain infinite
 Mind Indeed the phrase infinite form involves a con
 tradiction of terms Finite man cannot be the image and
2581 likeness of the infinite God A mortal corporeal or
 finite conception of God cannot embrace the glories of
2583 limitless incorporeal Life and Love Hence
 the unsatisfied human craving for something
 better higher holier than is afforded by a
2586 material belief in a physical God and man The insuffi
 ciency of this belief to supply the true idea proves the
 falsity of material belief

 Infinitys reflection

2589 Man is more than a material form with a mind inside
 which must escape from its environments in
 order to be immortal Man reflects infinity
25812 and this reflection is the true idea of God

 God expresses in man the infinite idea forever develop
 ing itself broadening and rising higher and higher from
25815 a boundless basis Mind manifests all that exists in
 the infinitude of Truth We know no more of man as
 the true divine image and likeness than we know of
25818 God

 The infinite Principle is reflected by the infinite idea
 and spiritual individuality but the material socalled senses
25821 have no cognizance of either Principle or its idea The
 human capacities are enlarged and perfected in propor
 tion as humanity gains the true conception of man and
25824 God

 Individual permanency

 Mortals have a very imperfect sense of the spiritual
 man and of the infinite range of his thought To him
25827 belongs eternal Life Never born and
 never dying it were impossible for man under
 the government of God in eternal Science to fall from his
25830 high estate

 Gods man discerned

 Through spiritual sense you can discern the heart of
 divinity and thus begin to comprehend in Science the
2591 generic term man Man is not absorbed in Deity and
 man cannot lose his individuality for he re
2593 flects eternal Life nor is he an isolated soli
 tary idea for he represents infinite Mind the sum of all
 substance

2596 In divine Science man is the true image of God The
 divine nature was best expressed in Christ Jesus who
 threw upon mortals the truer reflection of God and lifted
2599 their lives higher than their poor thoughtmodels would
 allow  thoughts which presented man as fallen sick
 sinning and dying The Christlike understanding of
25912 scientific being and divine healing includes a perfect Prin
 ciple and idea  perfect God and perfect man  as the
 basis of thought and demonstration

 The divine image not lost

25915 If man was once perfect but has now lost his perfection
 then mortals have never beheld in man the reflex image
 of God The lost image is no image The
25918 true likeness cannot be lost in divine reflection
 Understanding this Jesus said Be ye there
 fore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is
25921 perfect

 Immortal models

 Mortal thought transmits its own images and forms
 its offspring after human illusions God Spirit works
25924 spiritually not materially Brain or matter
 never formed a human concept Vibration is
 not intelligence hence it is not a creator Immortal
25927 ideas pure perfect and enduring are transmitted by
 the divine Mind through divine Science which corrects
 error with truth and demands spiritual thoughts divine
25930 concepts to the end that they may produce harmonious
 results

 Deducing ones conclusions as to man from imperfec
2601 tion instead of perfection one can no more arrive at the
 true conception or understanding of man and make him
2603 self like it than the sculptor can perfect his outlines from
 an imperfect model or the painter can depict the form
 and face of Jesus while holding in thought the character
2606 of Judas

 Spiritual discovery

 The conceptions of mortal erring thought must give
 way to the ideal of all that is perfect and eternal Through
2609 many generations human beliefs will be attain
 ing diviner conceptions and the immortal and
 perfect model of Gods creation will finally be seen as
26012 the only true conception of being

 Science reveals the possibility of achieving all good
 and sets mortals at work to discover what God has already
26015 done but distrust of ones ability to gain the goodness
 desired and to bring out better and higher results often
 hampers the trial of ones wings and ensures failure at the
26018 outset

 Requisite change of our ideals

 Mortals must change their ideals in order to improve
 their models A sick body is evolved from
26021 sick thoughts Sickness disease and death
 proceed from fear Sensualism evolves bad
 physical and moral conditions

26024 Selfishness and sensualism are educated in mortal
 mind by the thoughts ever recurring to ones self by
 conversation about the body and by the expectation of
26027 perpetual pleasure or pain from it and this education
 is at the expense of spiritual growth If we array
 thought in mortal vestures it must lose its immortal
26030 nature

 Thoughts are things

 If we look to the body for pleasure we find pain for
 Life we find death for Truth we find error for Spirit
2611 we find its opposite matter Now reverse this action
 Look away from the body into Truth and Love
2613 the Principle of all happiness harmony and
 immortality Hold thought steadfastly to the endur
 ing the good and the true and you will bring these
2616 into your experience proportionably to their occupancy
 of your thoughts

 Unreality of pain

 The effect of mortal mind on health and happiness is
2619 seen in this If one turns away from the body with such
 absorbed interest as to forget it the body
 experiences no pain Under the strong im
26112 pulse of a desire to perform his part a noted actor was
 accustomed night after night to go upon the stage and
 sustain his appointed task walking about as actively
26115 as the youngest member of the company This old man
 was so lame that he hobbled every day to the theatre and
 sat aching in his chair till his cue was spoken  a signal
26118 which made him as oblivious of physical infirmity as if
 he had inhaled chloroform though he was in the full pos
 session of his socalled senses

 Immutable identity of man

26121 Detach sense from the body or matter which is only
 a form of human belief and you may learn the meaning
 of God or good and the nature of the immu
26124 table and immortal Breaking away from the
 mutations of time and sense you will neither
 lose the solid objects and ends of life nor your own iden
26127 tity Fixing your gaze on the realities supernal you will
 rise to the spiritual consciousness of being even as the bird
 which has burst from the egg and preens its wings for a
26130 skyward flight

 Forgetfulness of self

 We should forget our bodies in remembering good and
 the human race Good demands of man every hour in
2621 which to work out the problem of being Consecration
 to good does not lessen mans dependence on God but
2623 heightens it Neither does consecration di
 minish mans obligations to God but shows
 the paramount necessity of meeting them Christian
2626 Science takes naught from the perfection of God but it
 ascribes to Him the entire glory By putting off the old
 man with his deeds mortals put on immortality

2629 We cannot fathom the nature and quality of Gods
 creation by diving into the shallows of mortal belief We
 must reverse our feeble flutterings  our efforts to find
26212 life and truth in matter  and rise above the testimony
 of the material senses above the mortal to the immortal
 idea of God These clearer higher views inspire the God
26215 like man to reach the absolute centre and circumference
 of his being

 The true sense

 Job said I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the
26218 ear but now mine eye seeth Thee Mortals will echo
 Jobs thought when the supposed pain and
 pleasure of matter cease to predominate They
26221 will then drop the false estimate of life and happiness of
 joy and sorrow and attain the bliss of loving unselfishly
 working patiently and conquering all that is unlike God
26224 Starting from a higher standpoint one rises spontane
 ously even as light emits light without effort for where
 your treasure is there will your heart be also

 Mind only the cause

26227 The foundation of mortal discord is a false sense of
 mans origin To begin rightly is to end rightly Every
 concept which seems to begin with the brain
26230 begins falsely Divine Mind is the only cause
 or Principle of existence Cause does not exist in matter
 in mortal mind or in physical forms

 Human egotism

2631 Mortals are egotists They believe themselves to be
 independent workers personal authors and even privi
2633 leged originators of something which Deity
 would not or could not create The creations
 of mortal mind are material Immortal spiritual man
2636 alone represents the truth of creation

 Mortal man a miscreator

 When mortal man blends his thoughts of existence
 with the spiritual and works only as God works
2639 he will no longer grope in the dark and cling
 to earth because he has not tasted heaven
 Carnal beliefs defraud us They make man an involun
26312 tary hypocrite  producing evil when he would create
 good forming deformity when he would outline grace
 and beauty injuring those whom he would bless He
26315 becomes a general miscreator who believes he is a
 semigod His touch turns hope to dust the dust we
 all have trod He might say in Bible language The
26318 good that I would I do not but the evil which I would
 not that I do

 No new creation

 There can be but one creator who has created all
26321 Whatever seems to be a new creation is but the discovery
 of some distant idea of Truth else it is a
 new multiplication or selfdivision of mor
26324 tal thought as when some finite sense peers from its
 cloister with amazement and attempts to pattern the
 infinite

26327 The multiplication of a human and mortal sense of per
 sons and things is not creation A sensual thought like
 an atom of dust thrown into the face of spiritual im
26330 mensity is dense blindness instead of a scientific eternal
 consciousness of creation

 Minds true camera

 The fading forms of matter the mortal body and ma
2641 terial earth are the fleeting concepts of the human mind
 They have their day before the permanent facts and their
2643 perfection in Spirit appear The crude crea
 tions of mortal thought must finally give place
 to the glorious forms which we sometimes behold in the
2646 camera of divine Mind when the mental picture is spir
 itual and eternal Mortals must look beyond fading
 finite forms if they would gain the true sense of things
2649 Where shall the gaze rest but in the unsearchable realm
 of Mind We must look where we would walk and we
 must act as possessing all power from Him in whom we
26412 have our being

 Selfcompleteness

 As mortals gain more correct views of God and man
 multitudinous objects of creation which before were
26415 invisible will become visible When we
 realize that Life is Spirit never in nor of
 matter this understanding will expand into selfcom
26418 pleteness finding all in God good and needing no other
 consciousness

 Spiritual proofs of existence

 Spirit and its formations are the only realities of being
26421 Matter disappears under the microscope of Spirit Sin
 is unsustained by Truth and sickness and
 death were overcome by Jesus who proved
26424 them to be forms of error Spiritual living
 and blessedness are the only evidences by which we can
 recognize true existence and feel the unspeakable peace
26427 which comes from an allabsorbing spiritual love

 When we learn the way in Christian Science and rec
 ognize mans spiritual being we shall behold and under
26430 stand Gods creation  all the glories of earth and heaven
 and man

 Godward gravitation

 The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings
2651 and its government is divine Science Man is the off
 spring not of the lowest but of the highest qualities of
2653 Mind Man understands spiritual existence
 in proportion as his treasures of Truth and
 Love are enlarged Mortals must gravitate Godward
2656 their affections and aims grow spiritual  they must near
 the broader interpretations of being and gain some proper
 sense of the infinite  in order that sin and mortality
2659 may be put off

 This scientific sense of being forsaking matter for
 Spirit by no means suggests mans absorption into Deity
26512 and the loss of his identity but confers upon man en
 larged individuality a wider sphere of thought and action
 a more expansive love a higher and more permanent
26515 peace

 Mortal birth and death

 The senses represent birth as untimely and death as
 irresistible as if man were a weed growing apace or a
26518 flower withered by the sun and nipped by
 untimely frosts but this is true only of a
 mortal not of a man in Gods image and likeness The
26521 truth of being is perennial and the error is unreal and
 obsolete

 Blessings from pain

 Who that has felt the loss of human peace has not gained
26524 stronger desires for spiritual joy The aspiration after
 heavenly good comes even before we discover
 what belongs to wisdom and Love The loss
26527 of earthly hopes and pleasures brightens the ascending
 path of many a heart The pains of sense quickly inform
 us that the pleasures of sense are mortal and that joy is
26530 spiritual

 Decapitation of error

 The pains of sense are salutary if they wrench away
 false pleasurable beliefs and transplant the affections
2661 from sense to Soul where the creations of God are good
 rejoicing the heart Such is the sword of
2663 Science with which Truth decapitates error
 materiality giving place to mans higher individuality and
 destiny

 Uses of adversity

2666 Would existence without personal friends be to you
 a blank Then the time will come when you will be
 solitary left without sympathy but this
2669 seeming vacuum is already filled with divine
 Love When this hour of development comes even if
 you cling to a sense of personal joys spiritual Love will
26612 force you to accept what best promotes your growth
 Friends will betray and enemies will slander until the
 lesson is sufficient to exalt you for mans extremity
26615 is Gods opportunity The author has experienced the
 foregoing prophecy and its blessings Thus He teaches
 mortals to lay down their fleshliness and gain spirituality
26618 This is done through selfabnegation Universal Love
 is the divine way in Christian Science

 The sinner makes his own hell by doing evil and the
26621 saint his own heaven by doing right The opposite per
 secutions of material sense aiding evil with evil would
 deceive the very elect

 Beatific presence

26624 Mortals must follow Jesus sayings and his demonstra
 tions which dominate the flesh Perfect and infinite
 Mind enthroned is heaven The evil beliefs
26627 which originate in mortals are hell Man is the
 idea of Spirit he reflects the beatific presence illuming
 the universe with light Man is deathless spiritual He
26630 is above sin or frailty He does not cross the barriers
 of time into the vast forever of Life but he coexists with
 God and the universe

 The infinitude of God

2671 Every object in material thought will be destroyed but
 the spiritual idea whose substance is in Mind is eternal
2673 The offspring of God start not from matter
 or ephemeral dust They are in and of Spirit
 divine Mind and so forever continue God is one The
2676 allness of Deity is His oneness Generically man is one
 and specifically man means all men

 It is generally conceded that God is Father eternal self
2679 created infinite If this is so the forever Father must
 have had children prior to Adam The great I AM made
 all that was made Hence man and the spiritual uni
26712 verse coexist with God

 Christian Scientists understand that in a religious
 sense they have the same authority for the appellative
26715 mother as for that of brother and sister Jesus said
 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which
 is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and
26718 mother

 Waymarks to eternal Truth

 When examined in the light of divine Science mortals
 present more than is detected upon the surface since
26721 inverted thoughts and erroneous beliefs must
 be counterfeits of Truth Thought is bor
 rowed from a higher source than matter and
26724 by reversal errors serve as waymarks to the one Mind
 in which all error disappears in celestial Truth The
 robes of Spirit are white and glistering like the raiment
26727 of Christ Even in this world therefore let thy gar
 ments be always white Blessed is the man that en
 dureth overcometh temptation for when he is tried
26730 proved faithful he shall receive the crown of life
 which the Lord hath promised to them that love him
 James i 12




 CHAPTER X  SCIENCE OF BEING

 That which was from the beginning which we have heard
 which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon
 and our hands have handled of the Word of life   
 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you
 that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our
 fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ
  JOHN First Epistle

 Here I stand I can do no otherwise so help me God Amen
  MARTIN LUTHER

 Materialistic challenge

2681 In the material world thought has brought to light
 with great rapidity many useful wonders With
2683 like activity have thoughts swift pinions been rising
 towards the realm of the real to the spiritual
 cause of those lower things which give im
2686 pulse to inquiry Belief in a material basis from
 which may be deduced all rationality is slowly yielding
 to the idea of a metaphysical basis looking away from
2689 matter to Mind as the cause of every effect Material
 istic hypotheses challenge metaphysics to meet in final
 combat In this revolutionary period like the shep
26812 herdboy with his sling woman goes forth to battle with
 Goliath

 Confusion confounded

 In this final struggle for supremacy semimetaphysi
26815 cal systems afford no substantial aid to scientific meta
 physics for their arguments are based on
 the false testimony of the material senses as
26818 well as on the facts of Mind These semimetaphysical
2691 systems are one and all pantheistic and savor of Pan
 demonium a house divided against itself

2693 From first to last the supposed coexistence of Mind
 and matter and the mingling of good and evil have re
 sulted from the philosophy of the serpent Jesus demon
2696 strations sift the chaff from the wheat and unfold the
 unity and the reality of good the unreality the nothing
 ness of evil

 Divine metaphysics

2699 Human philosophy has made God manlike Christian
 Science makes man Godlike The first is error the latter
 is truth Metaphysics is above physics and
26912 matter does not enter into metaphysical prem
 ises or conclusions The categories of metaphysics rest
 on one basis the divine Mind Metaphysics resolves
26915 things into thoughts and exchanges the objects of sense
 for the ideas of Soul

 These ideas are perfectly real and tangible to spiritual
26918 consciousness and they have this advantage over the ob
 jects and thoughts of material sense  they are good and
 eternal

 Biblical foundations

26921 The testimony of the material senses is neither abso
 lute nor divine I therefore plant myself unreservedly
 on the teachings of Jesus of his apostles of
26924 the prophets and on the testimony of the
 Science of Mind Other foundations there are none
 All other systems  systems based wholly or partly on
26927 knowledge gained through the material senses  are reeds
 shaken by the wind not houses built on the rock

 Rejected theories

 The theories I combat are these 1 that all is matter
26930 2 that matter originates in Mind and is as
 real as Mind possessing intelligence and life
 The first theory that matter is everything is quite as
2701 reasonable as the second that Mind and matter coexist
 and cooperate One only of the following statements can
2703 be true 1 that everything is matter 2 that every
 thing is Mind Which one is it

 Matter and Mind are opposites One is contrary to
2706 the other in its very nature and essence hence both can
 not be real If one is real the other must be unreal Only
 by understanding that there is but one power  not two
2709 powers matter and Mind  are scientific and logical
 conclusions reached Few deny the hypothesis that in
 telligence apart from man and matter governs the uni
27012 verse and it is generally admitted that this intelligence
 is the eternal Mind or divine principle Love

 Prophetic ignorance

 The prophets of old looked for something higher than
27015 the systems of their times hence their fore
 sight of the new dispensation of Truth But
 they knew not what would be the precise nature of the
27018 teaching and demonstration of God divine Mind in His
 more infinite meanings  the demonstration which was
 to destroy sin sickness and death establish the definition
27021 of omnipotence and maintain the Science of Spirit

 The pride of priesthood is the prince of this world It
 has nothing in Christ Meekness and charity have divine
27024 authority Mortals think wickedly consequently they
 are wicked They think sickly thoughts and so become
 sick If sin makes sinners Truth and Love alone can
27027 unmake them If a sense of disease produces suffering
 and a sense of ease antidotes suffering disease is mental
 not material Hence the fact that the human mind alone
27030 suffers is sick and that the divine Mind alone heals

 The life of Christ Jesus was not miraculous but it was
 indigenous to his spirituality  the good soil wherein the
2711 seed of Truth springs up and bears much fruit Christs
 Christianity is the chain of scientific being reappearing
2713 in all ages maintaining its obvious correspondence with
 the Scriptures and uniting all periods in the design of
 God Neither emasculation illusion nor insubordination
2716 exists in divine Science

 Jesus instructed his disciples whereby to heal the sick
 through Mind instead of matter He knew that the phi
2719 losophy Science and proof of Christianity were in Truth
 casting out all inharmony

 Studious disciples

 In Latin the word rendered disciple signifies student
27112 and the word indicates that the power of healing was not
 a supernatural gift to those learners but the
 result of their cultivated spiritual understand
27115 ing of the divine Science which their Master demonstrated
 by healing the sick and sinning Hence the universal ap
 plication of his saying Neither pray I for these alone
27118 but for them also which shall believe on me understand
 me through their word

 New Testament basis

 Our Master said But the Comforter    shall
27121 teach you all things When the Science of Christianity
 appears it will lead you into all truth The
 Sermon on the Mount is the essence of this
27124 Science and the eternal life not the death of Jesus is
 its outcome

 Modern evangel

 Those who are willing to leave their nets or to cast
27127 them on the right side for Truth have the opportunity
 now as aforetime to learn and to practise
 Christian healing The Scriptures contain it
27130 The spiritual import of the Word imparts this power
 But as Paul says How shall they hear without a
 preacher and how shall they preach except they be
2721 sent If sent how shall they preach convert and heal
 multitudes except the people hear

 Spirituality of Scripture

2723 The spiritual sense of truth must be gained before
 Truth can be understood This sense is assimilated only
 as we are honest unselfish loving and meek
2726 In the soil of an honest and good heart the
 seed must be sown else it beareth not much fruit for the
 swinish element in human nature uproots it Jesus said
2729 Ye do err not knowing the Scriptures The spiritual
 sense of the Scriptures brings out the scientific sense and
 is the new tongue referred to in the last chapter of Marks
27212 Gospel

 Jesus parable of the sower shows the care our
 Master took not to impart to dull ears and gross hearts
27215 the spiritual teachings which dulness and grossness could
 not accept Reading the thoughts of the people he said
 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast
27218 ye your pearls before swine

 Unspiritual contrasts

 It is the spiritualization of thought and Christianization
 of daily life in contrast with the results of the ghastly farce
27221 of material existence it is chastity and purity
 in contrast with the downward tendencies
 and earthward gravitation of sensualism and impurity
27224 which really attest the divine origin and operation of Chris
 tian Science The triumphs of Christian Science are re
 corded in the destruction of error and evil from which are
27227 propagated the dismal beliefs of sin sickness and death

 God the Principle of all

 The divine Principle of the universe must interpret the
 universe God is the divine Principle of all that repre
27230 sents Him and of all that really exists Chris
 tian Science as demonstrated by Jesus alone
 reveals the natural divine Principle of Science

2731 Matter and its claims of sin sickness and death are
 contrary to God and cannot emanate from Him There
2733 is no material truth The physical senses can take no
 cognizance of God and spiritual Truth Human belief
 has sought out many inventions but not one of them
2736 can solve the problem of being without the divine Prin
 ciple of divine Science Deductions from material hy
 potheses are not scientific They differ from real Science
2739 because they are not based on the divine law

 Science versus sense

 Divine Science reverses the false testimony of the ma
 terial senses and thus tears away the foun
27312 dations of error Hence the enmity between
 Science and the senses and the impossibility
 of attaining perfect understanding till the errors of sense
27315 are eliminated

 The socalled laws of matter and of medical science have
 never made mortals whole harmonious and immortal
27318 Man is harmonious when governed by Soul Hence the
 importance of understanding the truth of being which
 reveals the laws of spiritual existence

 Spiritual law the only law

27321 God never ordained a material law to annul the spiritual
 law If there were such a material law it would oppose
 the supremacy of Spirit God and impugn the
27324 wisdom of the creator Jesus walked on the
 waves fed the multitude healed the sick and raised the
 dead in direct opposition to material laws His acts were
27327 the demonstration of Science overcoming the false claims
 of material sense or law

 Material knowledge illusive

 Science shows that material conflicting mortal opin
27330 ions and beliefs emit the effects of error at all times but
 this atmosphere of mortal mind cannot be destructive to
 morals and health when it is opposed promptly and per
2741 sistently by Christian Science Truth and Love antidote
 this mental miasma and thus invigorate and sustain ex
2743 istence Unnecessary knowledge gained from
 the five senses is only temporal  the concep
 tion of mortal mind the offspring of sense not
2746 of Soul Spirit  and symbolizes all that is evil and
 perishable Natural science as it is commonly called is
 not really natural nor scientific because it is deduced from
2749 the evidence of the material senses Ideas on the con
 trary are born of Spirit and are not mere inferences
 drawn from material premises

 Five senses deceptive

27412 The senses of Spirit abide in Love and they demon
 strate Truth and Life Hence Christianity and the Sci
 ence which expounds it are based on spiritual
27415 understanding and they supersede the so
 called laws of matter Jesus demonstrated this great
 verity When what we erroneously term the five physical
27418 senses are misdirected they are simply the manifested
 beliefs of mortal mind which affirm that life substance
 and intelligence are material instead of spiritual These
27421 false beliefs and their products constitute the flesh and
 the flesh wars against Spirit

 Impossible partnership

 Divine Science is absolute and permits no halfway
27424 position in learning its Principle and rule  establishing
 it by demonstration The conventional firm
 called matter and mind God never formed
27427 Science and understanding governed by the unerring and
 eternal Mind destroy the imaginary copartnership matter
 and mind formed only to be destroyed in a manner and
27430 at a period as yet unknown This suppositional partner
 ship is already obsolete for matter examined in the light
 of divine metaphysics disappears

 Spirit the startingpoint

2751 Matter has no life to lose and Spirit never dies A
 partnership of mind with matter would ignore omnipres
2753 ent and omnipotent Mind This shows that
 matter did not originate in God Spirit and is
 not eternal Therefore matter is neither substantial living
2756 nor intelligent The startingpoint of divine Science is
 that God Spirit is Allinall and that there is no other
 might nor Mind  that God is Love and therefore He
2759 is divine Principle

 Divine synonyms

 To grasp the reality and order of being in its Science
 you must begin by reckoning God as the divine Principle
27512 of all that really is Spirit Life Truth Love
 combine as one  and are the Scriptural names
 for God All substance intelligence wisdom being im
27515 mortality cause and effect belong to God These are
 His attributes the eternal manifestations of the infinite
 divine Principle Love No wisdom is wise but His
27518 wisdom no truth is true no love is lovely no life is Life
 but the divine no good is but the good God bestows

 The divine completeness

 Divine metaphysics as revealed to spiritual understand
27521 ing shows clearly that all is Mind and that Mind is
 God omnipotence omnipresence omniscience
  that is all power all presence all Science
27524 Hence all is in reality the manifestation of Mind

 Our material human theories are destitute of Science
 The true understanding of God is spiritual It robs the
27527 grave of victory It destroys the false evidence that mis
 leads thought and points to other gods or other socalled
 powers such as matter disease sin and death superior
27530 or contrary to the one Spirit

 Truth spiritually discerned is scientifically understood
 It casts out error and heals the sick

 Universal brotherhood

2761 Having one God one Mind unfolds the power that
 heals the sick and fulfils these sayings of Scripture I
2763 am the Lord that healeth thee and I have
 found a ransom When the divine precepts
 are understood they unfold the foundation of fellowship
2766 in which one mind is not at war with another but all have
 one Spirit God one intelligent source in accordance with
 the Scriptural command Let this Mind be in you
2769 which was also in Christ Jesus Man and his Maker
 are correlated in divine Science and real consciousness
 is cognizant only of the things of God

27612 The realization that all inharmony is unreal brings
 objects and thoughts into human view in their true light
 and presents them as beautiful and immortal Harmony
27615 in man is as real and immortal as in music Discord is
 unreal and mortal

 Perfection requisite

 If God is admitted to be the only Mind and Life
27618 there ceases to be any opportunity for sin and death
 When we learn in Science how to be perfect
 even as our Father in heaven is perfect
27621 thought is turned into new and healthy channels 
 towards the contemplation of things immortal and away
 from materiality to the Principle of the universe includ
27624 ing harmonious man

 Material beliefs and spiritual understanding never
 mingle The latter destroys the former Discord is the
27627 nothingness named error Harmony is the somethingness
 named Truth

 Like evolving like

 Nature and revelation inform us that like produces
27630 like Divine Science does not gather grapes
 from thorns nor figs from thistles Intelli
 gence never produces nonintelligence but matter is
2771 ever nonintelligent and therefore cannot spring from
 intelligence To all that is unlike unerring and eternal
2773 Mind this Mind saith Thou shalt surely die and else
 where the Scripture says that dust returns to dust The
 nonintelligent relapses into its own unreality Matter
2776 never produces mind The immortal never produces the
 mortal Good cannot result in evil As God Himself is
 good and is Spirit goodness and spirituality must be im
2779 mortal Their opposites evil and matter are mortal
 error and error has no creator If goodness and spirit
 uality are real evil and materiality are unreal and can
27712 not be the outcome of an infinite God good

 Natural history presents vegetables and animals as
 preserving their original species  like reproducing like
27715 A mineral is not produced by a vegetable nor the man
 by the brute In reproduction the order of genus and
 species is preserved throughout the entire round of nature
27718 This points to the spiritual truth and Science of being
 Error relies upon a reversal of this order asserts that
 Spirit produces matter and matter produces all the ills
27721 of flesh and therefore that good is the origin of evil
 These suppositions contradict even the order of material
 socalled science

 Material error

27724 The realm of the real is Spirit The unlikeness of Spirit
 is matter and the opposite of the real is not divine  it is
 a human concept Matter is an error of state
27727 ment This error in the premise leads to errors
 in the conclusion in every statement into which it enters
 Nothing we can say or believe regarding matter is immor
27730 tal for matter is temporal and is therefore a mortal phe
 nomenon a human concept sometimes beautiful always
 erroneous

 Substance versus supposition

2781 Is Spirit the source or creator of matter Science re
 veals nothing in Spirit out of which to create matter
2783 Divine metaphysics explains away matter
 Spirit is the only substance and consciousness
 recognized by divine Science The material
2786 senses oppose this but there are no material senses for
 matter has no mind In Spirit there is no matter even
 as in Truth there is no error and in good no evil It is
2789 a false supposition the notion that there is real substance
 matter the opposite of Spirit Spirit God is infinite
 all Spirit can have no opposite

 One cause supreme

27812 That matter is substantial or has life and sensation is
 one of the false beliefs of mortals and exists only in a
 supposititious mortal consciousness Hence
27815 as we approach Spirit and Truth we lose the
 consciousness of matter The admission that there can
 be material substance requires another admission 
27818 namely that Spirit is not infinite and that matter is self
 creative selfexistent and eternal From this it would
 follow that there are two eternal causes warring forever
27821 with each other and yet we say that Spirit is supreme
 and allpresence

 The belief of the eternity of matter contradicts the
27824 demonstration of life as Spirit and leads to the conclu
 sion that if man is material he originated in matter and
 must return to dust  logic which would prove his an
27827 nihilation

 Substance is Spirit

 All that we term sin sickness and death is a mortal
 belief We define matter as error because it is the oppo
27830 site of life substance and intelligence Mat
 ter with its mortality cannot be substantial
 if Spirit is substantial and eternal Which ought to
2791 be substance to us  the erring changing and dying
 the mutable and mortal or the unerring immutable
2793 and immortal A New Testament writer plainly de
 scribes faith a quality of mind as the substance of things
 hoped for

 Material mortality

2796 The doom of matter establishes the conclusion that
 matter slime or protoplasm never originated
 in the immortal Mind and is therefore not
2799 eternal Matter is neither created by Mind nor for the
 manifestation and support of Mind

 Spiritual tangibility

 Ideas are tangible and real to immortal consciousness
27912 and they have the advantage of being eternal
 Spirit and matter can neither coexist nor co
 operate and one can no more create the other than
27915 Truth can create error or vice versa

 In proportion as the belief disappears that life and in
 telligence are in or of matter the immortal facts of
27918 being are seen and their only idea or intelligence is
 in God Spirit is reached only through the understand
 ing and demonstration of eternal Life and Truth and
27921 Love

 Pantheistic tendencies

 Every system of human philosophy doctrine and
 medicine is more or less infected with the pantheistic
27924 belief that there is mind in matter but this
 belief contradicts alike revelation and right
 reasoning A logical and scientific conclusion is reached
27927 only through the knowledge that there are not two
 bases of being matter and mind but one alone 
 Mind

27930 Pantheism starting from a material sense of God
 seeks cause in effect Principle in its idea and life and
 intelligence in matter

 The things of God are beautiful

2801 In the infinitude of Mind matter must be unknown
 Symbols and elements of discord and decay are not prod
2803 ucts of the infinite perfect and eternal All
 From Love and from the light and harmony
 which are the abode of Spirit only reflections
2806 of good can come All things beautiful and harmless are
 ideas of Mind Mind creates and multiplies them and
 the product must be mental

2809 Finite belief can never do justice to Truth in any direc
 tion Finite belief limits all things and would compress
 Mind which is infinite beneath a skull bone Such be
28012 lief can neither apprehend nor worship the infinite and
 to accommodate its finite sense of the divisibility of Soul
 and substance it seeks to divide the one Spirit into per
28015 sons and souls

 Belief in many gods

 Through this error human belief comes to have gods
 many and lords many Moses declared as Jehovahs
28018 first command of the Ten Thou shalt have
 no other gods before me But behold the
 zeal of belief to establish the opposite error of many
28021 minds The argument of the serpent in the allegory Ye
 shall be as gods urges through every avenue the belief
 that Soul is in body and that infinite Spirit and Life is
28024 in finite forms

 Sensationless body

 Rightly understood instead of possessing a sentient
 material form man has a sensationless body and God
28027 the Soul of man and of all existence being
 perpetual in His own individuality harmony
 and immortality imparts and perpetuates these qualities
28030 in man  through Mind not matter The only excuse
 for entertaining human opinions and rejecting the Science
 of being is our mortal ignorance of Spirit  ignorance
2811 which yields only to the understanding of divine Science
 the understanding by which we enter into the kingdom
2813 of Truth on earth and learn that Spirit is infinite and
 supreme Spirit and matter no more commingle than
 light and darkness When one appears the other dis
2816 appears

 God and His image

 Error presupposes man to be both mind and matter
 Divine Science contradicts the corporeal senses rebukes
2819 mortal belief and asks What is the Ego
 whence its origin and what its destiny The
 Egoman is the reflection of the EgoGod the Egoman
28112 is the image and likeness of perfect Mind Spirit divine
 Principle

 The one Ego the one Mind or Spirit called God is
28115 infinite individuality which supplies all form and come
 liness and which reflects reality and divinity in individual
 spiritual man and things

28118 The mind supposed to exist in matter or beneath a
 skull bone is a myth a misconceived sense and false
 conception as to man and Mind When we put off the
28121 false sense for the true and see that sin and mortality
 have neither Principle nor permanency we shall learn
 that sin and mortality are without actual origin or right
28124 ful existence They are native nothingness out of which
 error would simulate creation through a man formed from
 dust

 The true new idea

28127 Divine Science does not put new wine into old bottles
 Soul into matter nor the infinite into the finite Our
 false views of matter perish as we grasp
28130 the facts of Spirit The old belief must be
 cast out or the new idea will be spilled and the in
 spiration which is to change our standpoint will be
2821 lost Now as of old Truth casts out evils and heals
 the sick

 Figures of being

2823 The real Life or Mind and its opposite the socalled
 material life and mind are figured by two geometrical
 symbols a circle or sphere and a straight
2826 line The circle represents the infinite with
 out beginning or end the straight line represents the
 finite which has both beginning and end The sphere
2829 represents good the selfexistent and eternal individuality
 or Mind the straight line represents evil a belief in
 a selfmade and temporary material existence Eternal
28212 Mind and temporary material existence never unite in
 figure or in fact

 Opposite symbols

 A straight line finds no abidingplace in a curve and a
28215 curve finds no adjustment to a straight line Similarly
 matter has no place in Spirit and Spirit has
 no place in matter Truth has no home in
28218 error and error has no foothold in Truth Mind cannot
 pass into nonintelligence and matter nor can nonintel
 ligence become Soul At no point can these opposites
28221 mingle or unite Even though they seem to touch one
 is still a curve and the other a straight line

 There is no inherent power in matter for all that is
28224 material is a material human mortal thought always
 governing itself erroneously

 Truth is the intelligence of immortal Mind Error is
28227 the socalled intelligence of mortal mind

 Truth is not inverted

 Whatever indicates the fall of man or the opposite of
 God or Gods absence is the Adamdream which is neither
28230 Mind nor man for it is not begotten of the
 Father The rule of inversion infers from
 error its opposite Truth but Truth is the light which
2831 dispels error As mortals begin to understand Spirit
 they give up the belief that there is any true existence
2833 apart from God

 Source of all life and action

 Mind is the source of all movement and there is no
 inertia to retard or check its perpetual and harmonious
2836 action Mind is the same Life Love and wis
 dom yesterday and today and forever
 Matter and its effects  sin sickness and
2839 death  are states of mortal mind which act react and
 then come to a stop They are not facts of Mind They
 are not ideas but illusions Principle is absolute It
28312 admits of no error but rests upon understanding

 But what say prevalent theories They insist that
 Life or God is one and the same with material life so
28315 called They speak of both Truth and error as mind
 and of good and evil as spirit They claim that to be
 life which is but the objective state of material sense 
28318 such as the structural life of the tree and of material
 man  and deem this the manifestation of the one Life
 God

 Spiritual structure

28321 This false belief as to what really constitutes life so
 detracts from Gods character and nature that the true
 sense of His power is lost to all who cling to
28324 this falsity The divine Principle or Life can
 not be practically demonstrated in length of days as it
 was by the patriarchs unless its Science be accurately
28327 stated We must receive the divine Principle in the under
 standing and live it in daily life and unless we so do we
 can no more demonstrate Science than we can teach and
28330 illustrate geometry by calling a curve a straight line or a
 straight line a sphere

 Are mentality immortality consciousness resident in
2841 matter It is not rational to say that Mind is infinite
 but dwells in finiteness  in matter  or that matter is
2843 infinite and the medium of Mind

 Mind never limited

 If God were limited to man or matter or if the infinite
 could be circumscribed within the finite God would be
2846 corporeal and unlimited Mind would seem
 to spring from a limited body but this is an
 impossibility Infinite Mind can have no startingpoint
2849 and can return to no limit It can never be in bonds
 nor be fully manifested through corporeality

 Material recognition impossible

 Is Gods image or likeness matter or a mortal sin
28412 sickness and death Can matter recognize Mind
 Can infinite Mind recognize matter Can the
 infinite dwell in the finite or know aught un
28415 like the infinite Can Deity be known through
 the material senses Can the material senses which re
 ceive no direct evidence of Spirit give correct testimony
28418 as to spiritual life truth and love

 The answer to all these questions must forever be in
 the negative

 Our physical insensibility to Spirit

28421 The physical senses can obtain no proof of God They
 can neither see Spirit through the eye nor hear it through
 the ear nor can they feel taste or smell Spirit
28424 Even the more subtile and misnamed ma
 terial elements are beyond the cognizance
 of these senses and are known only by the effects com
28427 monly attributed to them

 According to Christian Science the only real senses
 of man are spiritual emanating from divine Mind
28430 Thought passes from God to man but neither sensation
 nor report goes from material body to Mind The in
 tercommunication is always from God to His idea man
2851 Matter is not sentient and cannot be cognizant of good
 or of evil of pleasure or of pain Mans individu
2853 ality is not material This Science of being obtains not
 alone hereafter in what men call Paradise but here
 and now it is the great fact of being for time and
2856 eternity

 The human counterfeit

 What then is the material personality which suffers
 sins and dies It is not man the image and likeness
2859 of God but mans counterfeit the inverted
 likeness the unlikeness called sin sickness
 and death The unreality of the claim that a mortal is
28512 the true image of God is illustrated by the opposite na
 tures of Spirit and matter Mind and body for one is
 intelligence while the other is nonintelligence

 Material misconceptions

28515 Is God a physical personality Spirit is not physical
 The belief that a material body is man is a false con
 ception of man The time has come for a
28518 finite conception of the infinite and of a ma
 terial body as the seat of Mind to give place
 to a diviner sense of intelligence and its manifestations
28521 to the better understanding that Science gives of the
 Supreme Being or divine Principle and idea

 Salvation is through reform

 By interpreting God as a corporeal Saviour but not as
28524 the saving Principle or divine Love we shall continue
 to seek salvation through pardon and not
 through reform and resort to matter instead
28527 of Spirit for the cure of the sick As mortals
 reach through knowledge of Christian Science a higher
 sense they will seek to learn not from matter but from
28530 the divine Principle God how to demonstrate the Christ
 Truth as the healing and saving power

 It is essential to understand instead of believe what
2861 relates most nearly to the happiness of being To seek
 Truth through belief in a human doctrine is not to un
2863 derstand the infinite We must not seek the immutable
 and immortal through the finite mutable and mortal
 and so depend upon belief instead of demonstration for
2866 this is fatal to a knowledge of Science The understand
 ing of Truth gives full faith in Truth and spiritual un
 derstanding is better than all burnt offerings

2869 The Master said No man cometh unto the Father
 the divine Principle of being but by me Christ
 Life Truth Love for Christ says I am the way
28612 Physical causation was put aside from first to
 last by this original man Jesus He knew that the
 divine Principle Love creates and governs all that
28615 is real

 Goodness a portion of God

 In the Saxon and twenty other tongues good is the term
 for God The Scriptures declare all that He
28618 made to be good like Himself  good in
 Principle and in idea Therefore the spiritual
 universe is good and reflects God as He is

 Spiritual thoughts

28621 Gods thoughts are perfect and eternal are substance
 and Life Material and temporal thoughts are human
 involving error and since God Spirit is the
28624 only cause they lack a divine cause The
 temporal and material are not then creations of Spirit
 They are but counterfeits of the spiritual and eternal
28627 Transitory thoughts are the antipodes of everlasting
 Truth though by the supposition of opposite qualities
 error must also say I am true But by this saying
28630 error the lie destroys itself

 Sin sickness and death are comprised in human ma
 terial belief and belong not to the divine Mind They
2871 are without a real origin or existence They have neither
 Principle nor permanence but belong with all that is
2873 material and temporal to the nothingness of error which
 simulates the creations of Truth All creations of Spirit
 are eternal but creations of matter must return to dust
2876 Error supposes man to be both mental and material
 Divine Science contradicts this postulate and maintains
 mans spiritual identity

 Divine allness

2879 We call the absence of Truth error Truth and error
 are unlike In Science Truth is divine and the infinite
 God can have no unlikeness Did God Truth
28712 create error No Doth a fountain send
 forth at the same place sweet water and bitter God
 being everywhere and allinclusive how can He be absent
28715 or suggest the absence of omnipresence and omnipotence
 How can there be more than all

 Neither understanding nor truth accompanies error
28718 nor is error the offshoot of Mind Evil calls itself some
 thing when it is nothing It saith I am man but I am
 not the image and likeness of God whereas the Scrip
28721 tures declare that man was made in Gods likeness

 Error unveiled

 Error is false mortal belief it is illusion without spir
 itual identity or foundation and it has no real existence
28724 The supposition that life substance and in
 telligence are in matter or of it is an error
 Matter is neither a thing nor a person but merely the
28727 objective supposition of Spirits opposite The five mate
 rial senses testify to truth and error as united in a mind
 both good and evil Their false evidence will finally
28730 yield to Truth  to the recognition of Spirit and of the
 spiritual creation

 Truth cannot be contaminated by error The state
2881 ment that Truth is real necessarily includes the correlated
 statement that error Truths unlikeness is unreal

 The great conflict

2883 The suppositional warfare between truth and error is
 only the mental conflict between the evidence of the spir
 itual senses and the testimony of the material
2886 senses and this warfare between the Spirit and
 flesh will settle all questions through faith in and the un
 derstanding of divine Love
2889 Superstition and understanding can never combine
 When the final physical and moral effects of Christian
 Science are fully apprehended the conflict between truth
28812 and error understanding and belief Science and material
 sense foreshadowed by the prophets and inaugurated
 by Jesus will cease and spiritual harmony reign The
28815 lightnings and thunderbolts of error may burst and flash
 till the cloud is cleared and the tumult dies away in the
 distance Then the raindrops of divinity refresh the
28818 earth As St Paul says There remaineth therefore
 a rest to the people of God of Spirit

 The chief stones in the temple

 The chief stones in the temple of Christian Science are
28821 to be found in the following postulates that Life is God
 good and not evil that Soul is sinless not
 to be found in the body that Spirit is not and
28824 cannot be materialized that Life is not subject
 to death that the spiritual real man has no birth no ma
 terial life and no death

 The Christelement

28827 Science reveals the glorious possibilities of immortal
 man forever unlimited by the mortal senses
 The Christelement in the Messiah made him
28830 the Wayshower Truth and Life

 The eternal Truth destroys what mortals seem to have
 learned from error and mans real existence as a child
2891 of God comes to light Truth demonstrated is eternal
 life Mortal man can never rise from the temporal debris
2893 of error belief in sin sickness and death until he learns
 that God is the only Life The belief that life and sensa
 tion are in the body should be overcome by the under
2896 standing of what constitutes man as the image of God
 Then Spirit will have overcome the flesh

 Wickedness is not man

 A wicked mortal is not the idea of God He is little
2899 else than the expression of error To suppose that sin
 lust hatred envy hypocrisy revenge have life
 abiding in them is a terrible mistake Life
28912 and lifes idea Truth and Truths idea never make men
 sick sinful or mortal

 Death but an illusion

 The fact that the Christ or Truth overcame and still
28915 overcomes death proves the king of terrors to be but
 a mortal belief or error which Truth destroys
 with the spiritual evidences of Life and this
28918 shows that what appears to the senses to be death is but a
 mortal illusion for to the real man and the real universe
 there is no deathprocess

28921 The belief that matter has life results by the universal
 law of mortal mind in a belief in death So man tree
 and flower are supposed to die but the fact remains
28924 that Gods universe is spiritual and immortal

 Spiritual offspring

 The spiritual fact and the material belief of things are
 contradictions but the spiritual is true and therefore the
28927 material must be untrue Life is not in matter
 Therefore it cannot be said to pass out of mat
 ter Matter and death are mortal illusions Spirit and
28930 all things spiritual are the real and eternal

 Man is not the offspring of flesh but of Spirit  of
 Life not of matter Because Life is God Life must be
2901 eternal selfexistent Life is the everlasting I AM the Be
 ing who was and is and shall be whom nothing can erase

 Death no advantage

2903 If the Principle rule and demonstration of mans being
 are not in the least understood before what is termed death
 overtakes mortals they will rise no higher spir
2906 itually in the scale of existence on account of
 that single experience but will remain as material as be
 fore the transition still seeking happiness through a ma
2909 terial instead of through a spiritual sense of life and from
 selfish and inferior motives That Life or Mind is finite
 and physical or is manifested through brain and nerves
29012 is false Hence Truth comes to destroy this error and
 its effects  sickness sin and death To the spiritual
 class relates the Scripture On such the second death
29015 hath no power

 Future purification

 If the change called death destroyed the belief in sin
 sickness and death happiness would be won at the mo
29018 ment of dissolution and be forever permanent
 but this is not so Perfection is gained only
 by perfection They who are unrighteous shall be un
29021 righteous still until in divine Science Christ Truth re
 moves all ignorance and sin

 Sin is punished

 The sin and error which possess us at the instant of
29024 death do not cease at that moment but endure until the
 death of these errors To be wholly spiritual
 man must be sinless and he becomes thus only
29027 when he reaches perfection The murderer though slain
 in the act does not thereby forsake sin He is no more
 spiritual for believing that his body died and learning that
29030 his cruel mind died not His thoughts are no purer until
 evil is disarmed by good His body is as material as his
 mind and vice versa

2911 The suppositions that sin is pardoned while unfor
 saken that happiness can be genuine in the midst of
2913 sin that the socalled death of the body frees from sin
 and that Gods pardon is aught but the destruction of
 sin  these are grave mistakes We know that all will
2916 be changed in the twinkling of an eye when the last
 trump shall sound but this last call of wisdom cannot
 come till mortals have already yielded to each lesser call
2919 in the growth of Christian character Mortals need not
 fancy that belief in the experience of death will awaken
 them to glorified being

 Salvation and probation

29112 Universal salvation rests on progression and probation
 and is unattainable without them Heaven is not a local
 ity but a divine state of Mind in which all the
29115 manifestations of Mind are harmonious and
 immortal because sin is not there and man is
 found having no righteousness of his own but in posses
29118 sion of the mind of the Lord as the Scripture says

 In the place where the tree falleth there it shall
 be So we read in Ecclesiastes This text has been
29121 transformed into the popular proverb As the tree
 falls so it must lie As man falleth asleep so shall he
 awake As death findeth mortal man so shall he be
29124 after death until probation and growth shall effect the
 needed change Mind never becomes dust No resur
 rection from the grave awaits Mind or Life for the grave
29127 has no power over either

 Day of judgment

 No final judgment awaits mortals for the judgment
 day of wisdom comes hourly and continually
29130 even the judgment by which mortal man is di
 vested of all material error As for spiritual error there
 is none

2921 When the last mortal fault is destroyed then the final
 trump will sound which will end the battle of Truth with
2923 error and mortality but of that day and hour knoweth
 no man Here prophecy pauses Divine Science alone
 can compass the heights and depths of being and reveal
2926 the infinite

 Primitive error

 Truth will be to us the resurrection and the life only
 as it destroys all error and the belief that Mind the only
2929 immortality of man can be fettered by the
 body and Life be controlled by death A sin
 ful sick and dying mortal is not the likeness of God the
29212 perfect and eternal

 Matter is the primitive belief of mortal mind because
 this socalled mind has no cognizance of Spirit To
29215 mortal mind matter is substantial and evil is
 real The socalled senses of mortals are material
 Hence the socalled life of mortals is dependent on
29218 matter

 Explaining the origin of material man and mortal mind
 Jesus said Why do ye not understand my speech
29221 Even because ye cannot hear my word Ye are of your
 father the devil evil and the lusts of your father ye will
 do He was a murderer from the beginning and abode
29224 not in the truth because there is no truth in him When
 he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
 and the father of it

 Immortal man

29227 This carnal material mentality misnamed mind is
 mortal Therefore man would be annihilated were it
 not for the spiritual real mans indissoluble
29230 connection with his God which Jesus brought
 to light In his resurrection and ascension Jesus showed
 that a mortal man is not the real essence of manhood and
2931 that this unreal material mortality disappears in presence
 of the reality

 Elementary electricity

2933 Electricity is not a vital fluid but the least material
 form of illusive consciousness  the material mindless
 ness which forms no link between matter and
2936 Mind and which destroys itself Matter and
 mortal mind are but different strata of human belief The
 grosser substratum is named matter or body the more
2939 ethereal is called mind This socalled mind and body
 is the illusion called a mortal a mind in matter In reality
 and in Science both strata mortal mind and mortal body
29312 are false representatives of man

 The material socalled gases and forces are counter
 feits of the spiritual forces of divine Mind whose potency
29315 is Truth whose attraction is Love whose adhesion and
 cohesion are Life perpetuating the eternal facts of being
 Electricity is the sharp surplus of materiality which coun
29318 terfeits the true essence of spirituality or truth  the
 great difference being that electricity is not intelligent
 while spiritual truth is Mind

 The counterfeit forces

29321 There is no vapid fury of mortal mind  expressed in
 earthquake wind wave lightning fire bestial ferocity
  and this socalled mind is selfdestroyed
29324 The manifestations of evil which counterfeit
 divine justice are called in the Scriptures The anger
 of the Lord In reality they show the selfdestruction
29327 of error or matter and point to matters opposite the
 strength and permanency of Spirit Christian Science
 brings to light Truth and its supremacy universal har
29330 mony the entireness of God good and the nothingness
 of evil

 Instruments of error

 The five physical senses are the avenues and instru
2941 ments of human error and they correspond with error
 These senses indicate the common human belief that life
2943 substance and intelligence are a unison of
 matter with Spirit This is pantheism and
 carries within itself the seeds of all error

2946 If man is both mind and matter the loss of one finger
 would take away some quality and quantity of the man
 for matter and man would be one

 Mortal verdict

2949 The belief that matter thinks sees or feels is not more
 real than the belief that matter enjoys and suffers This
 mortal belief misnamed man is error saying
29412 Matter has intelligence and sensation Nerves
 feel Brain thinks and sins The stomach can make a
 man cross Injury can cripple and matter can kill man
29415 This verdict of the socalled material senses victimizes
 mortals taught as they are by physiology and pathology
 to revere false testimony even the errors that are destroyed
29418 by Truth through spiritual sense and Science

 Mythical pleasure

 The lines of demarcation between immortal man repre
 senting Spirit and mortal man representing the error that
29421 life and intelligence are in matter show the
 pleasures and pains of matter to be myths and
 human belief in them to be the father of mythology in
29424 which matter is represented as divided into intelligent gods
 Mans genuine selfhood is recognizable only in what is
 good and true Man is neither selfmade nor made by
29427 mortals God created man

 Severed members

 The inebriate believes that there is pleasure in intoxica
 tion The thief believes that he gains something by steal
29430 ing and the hypocrite that he is hiding himself The
 Science of Mind corrects such mistakes for Truth demon
 strates the falsity of error

 Severed members

2951 The belief that a severed limb is aching in the old loca
 tion the sensation seeming to be in nerves which
2953 are no longer there is an added proof of the un
 reliability of physical testimony

 Mortals unlike immortals

 God creates and governs the universe including man
2956 The universe is filled with spiritual ideas which He
 evolves and they are obedient to the Mind
 that makes them Mortal mind would trans
2959 form the spiritual into the material and then
 recover mans original self in order to escape from the
 mortality of this error Mortals are not like immortals
29512 created in Gods own image but infinite Spirit being all
 mortal consciousness will at last yield to the scientific fact
 and disappear and the real sense of being perfect and
29515 forever intact will appear

 Goodness transparent

 The manifestation of God through mortals is as light
 passing through the windowpane The light and the
29518 glass never mingle but as matter the glass
 is less opaque than the walls The mortal
 mind through which Truth appears most vividly is that
29521 one which has lost much materiality  much error  in
 order to become a better transparency for Truth Then
 like a cloud melting into thin vapor it no longer hides
29524 the sun

 Brainology a myth

 All that is called mortal thought is made up of error
 The theoretical mind is matter named brain or mate
29527 rial consciousness the exact opposite of real
 Mind or Spirit Brainology teaches that
 mortals are created to suffer and die It further
29530 teaches that when man is dead his immortal soul is
 resurrected from death and mortality Thus error the
 orizes that spirit is born of matter and returns to mat
2961 ter and that man has a resurrection from dust whereas
 Science unfolds the eternal verity that man is the spiritual
2963 eternal reflection of God

 Scientific purgation

 Progress is born of experience It is the ripening of
 mortal man through which the mortal is dropped for
2966 the immortal Either here or hereafter suf
 fering or Science must destroy all illusions
 regarding life and mind and regenerate material sense
2969 and self The old man with his deeds must be put off
 Nothing sensual or sinful is immortal The death of a
 false material sense and of sin not the death of organic
29612 matter is what reveals man and Life harmonious real
 and eternal

 The socalled pleasures and pains of matter perish
29615 and they must go out under the blaze of Truth spiritual
 sense and the actuality of being Mortal belief must lose
 all satisfaction in error and sin in order to part with
29618 them

 Whether mortals will learn this sooner or later and
 how long they will suffer the pangs of destruction de
29621 pends upon the tenacity of error

 Mixed testimony

 The knowledge obtained from the corporeal senses
 leads to sin and death When the evidence of Spirit
29624 and matter Truth and error seems to com
 mingle it rests upon foundations which time
 is wearing away Mortal mind judges by the testimony
29627 of the material senses until Science obliterates this false
 testimony An improved belief is one step out of error
 and aids in taking the next step and in understanding
29630 the situation in Christian Science

 Belief an autocrat

 Mortal belief is a liar from the beginning not deserving
 power It says to mortals You are wretched and they
2971 think they are so and nothing can change this state until
 the belief changes Mortal belief says You are happy
2973 and mortals are so and no circumstance can
 alter the situation until the belief on this sub
 ject changes Human belief says to mortals You are
2976 sick and this testimony manifests itself on the body as
 sickness It is as necessary for a healthillusion as for
 an illusion of sickness to be instructed out of itself into
2979 the understanding of what constitutes health for a change
 in either a healthbelief or a belief in sickness affects the
 physical condition

 Selfimprovement

29712 Erroneous belief is destroyed by truth Change the
 evidence and that disappears which before seemed real
 to this false belief and the human conscious
29715 ness rises higher Thus the reality of being
 is attained and man found to be immortal The only
 fact concerning any material concept is that it is neither
29718 scientific nor eternal but subject to change and dis
 solution

 Faith higher than belief

 Faith is higher and more spiritual than belief It is
29721 a chrysalis state of human thought in which spiritual
 evidence contradicting the testimony of mate
 rial sense begins to appear and Truth the
29724 everpresent is becoming understood Human thoughts
 have their degrees of comparison Some thoughts are
 better than others A belief in Truth is better than a
29727 belief in error but no mortal testimony is founded on the
 divine rock Mortal testimony can be shaken Until
 belief becomes faith and faith becomes spiritual under
29730 standing human thought has little relation to the actual
 or divine

 A mortal belief fulfils its own conditions Sickness
2981 sin and death are the vague realities of human conclu
 sions Life Truth and Love are the realities of divine
2983 Science They dawn in faith and glow fullorbed in
 spiritual understanding As a cloud hides the sun it
 cannot extinguish so false belief silences for a while the
2986 voice of immutable harmony but false belief cannot de
 stroy Science armed with faith hope and fruition

 Truths witness

 What is termed material sense can report only a mor
2989 tal temporary sense of things whereas spiritual sense can
 bear witness only to Truth To material sense
 the unreal is the real until this sense is corrected
29812 by Christian Science

 Spiritual sense contradicting the material senses in
 volves intuition hope faith understanding fruition real
29815 ity Material sense expresses the belief that mind is in
 matter This human belief alternating between a sense
 of pleasure and pain hope and fear life and death never
29818 reaches beyond the boundary of the mortal or the unreal
 When the real is attained which is announced by Science
 joy is no longer a trembler nor is hope a cheat Spirit
29821 ual ideas like numbers and notes start from Principle
 and admit no materialistic beliefs Spiritual ideas lead
 up to their divine origin God and to the spiritual sense
29824 of being

 Thoughtangels

 Angels are not etherealized human beings evolving
 animal qualities in their wings but they are celestial
29827 visitants flying on spiritual not material
 pinions Angels are pure thoughts from God
 winged with Truth and Love no matter what their indi
29830 vidualism may be Human conjecture confers upon angels
 its own forms of thought marked with superstitious out
 lines making them human creatures with suggestive
2991 feathers but this is only fancy It has behind it no more
 reality than has the sculptors thought when he carves
2993 his Statue of Liberty which embodies his concep
 tion of an unseen quality or condition but which has
 no physical antecedent reality save in the artists own ob
2996 servation and chambers of imagery

 Our Angelic messengers

 My angels are exalted thoughts appearing at the door
 of some sepulchre in which human belief has buried
2999 its fondest earthly hopes With white fin
 gers they point upward to a new and glo
 rified trust to higher ideals of life and its joys Angels
29912 are Gods representatives These upwardsoaring beings
 never lead towards self sin or materiality but guide to
 the divine Principle of all good whither every real indi
29915 viduality image or likeness of God gathers By giving
 earnest heed to these spiritual guides they tarry with us
 and we entertain angels unawares

 Knowledge and Truth

29918 Knowledge gained from material sense is figuratively
 represented in Scripture as a tree bearing the fruits of
 sin sickness and death Ought we not then
29921 to judge the knowledge thus obtained to be
 untrue and dangerous since the tree is known by his
 fruit

29924 Truth never destroys Gods idea Truth is spiritual
 eternal substance which cannot destroy the right reflec
 tion Corporeal sense or error may seem to hide Truth
29927 health harmony and Science as the mist obscures the
 sun or the mountain but Science the sunshine of Truth
 will melt away the shadow and reveal the celestial
29930 peaks

 Old and new man

 If man were solely a creature of the material senses
 he would have no eternal Principle and would be mutable
3001 and mortal Human logic is awry when it attempts
 to draw correct spiritual conclusions regarding life from
3003 matter Finite sense has no true apprecia
 tion of infinite Principle God or of His infi
 nite image or reflection man The mirage which makes
3006 trees and cities seem to be where they are not illustrates
 the illusion of material man who cannot be the image
 of God

3009 So far as the scientific statement as to man is under
 stood it can be proved and will bring to light the true
 reflection of God  the real man or the new man as
30012 St Paul has it

 The tares and wheat

 The temporal and unreal never touch the eternal and
 real The mutable and imperfect never touch the im
30015 mutable and perfect The inharmonious and
 selfdestructive never touch the harmonious
 and selfexistent These opposite qualities are the tares
30018 and wheat which never really mingle though to mortal
 sight they grow side by side until the harvest then Sci
 ence separates the wheat from the tares through the real
30021 ization of God as ever present and of man as reflecting
 the divine likeness

 The divine reflection

 Spirit is God Soul therefore Soul is not in matter If
30024 Spirit were in matter God would have no representative
 and matter would be identical with God
 The theory that soul spirit intelligence in
30027 habits matter is taught by the schools This theory is
 unscientific The universe reflects and expresses the di
 vine substance or Mind therefore God is seen only in the
30030 spiritual universe and spiritual man as the sun is seen in
 the ray of light which goes out from it God is re
 vealed only in that which reflects Life Truth Love 
3011 yea which manifests Gods attributes and power even
 as the human likeness thrown upon the mirror repeats
3013 the color form and action of the person in front of the
 mirror

 Few persons comprehend what Christian Science
3016 means by the word reflection To himself mortal and
 material man seems to be substance but his sense of
 substance involves error and therefore is material
3019 temporal

 On the other hand the immortal spiritual man is really
 substantial and reflects the eternal substance or Spirit
30112 which mortals hope for He reflects the divine which
 constitutes the only real and eternal entity This reflection
 seems to mortal sense transcendental because the spiritual
30115 mans substantiality transcends mortal vision and is re
 vealed only through divine Science

 Inverted images and ideas

 As God is substance and man is the divine image and
30118 likeness man should wish for and in reality has only
 the substance of good the substance of Spirit
 not matter The belief that man has any other
30121 substance or mind is not spiritual and breaks
 the First Commandment Thou shalt have one God one
 Mind Mortal man seems to himself to be material sub
30124 stance while man is image idea Delusion sin dis
 ease and death arise from the false testimony of material
 sense which from a supposed standpoint outside the
30127 focal distance of infinite Spirit presents an inverted image
 of Mind and substance with everything turned upside
 down

30130 This falsity presupposes soul to be an unsubstantial
 dweller in material forms and man to be material instead
 of spiritual Immortality is not bounded by mortality
3021 Soul is not compassed by finiteness Principle is not to
 be found in fragmentary ideas

 Identity not lost

3023 The material body and mind are temporal but the
 real man is spiritual and eternal The identity of the
 real man is not lost but found through this
3026 explanation for the conscious infinitude of
 existence and of all identity is thereby discerned and re
 mains unchanged It is impossible that man should lose
3029 aught that is real when God is all and eternally his The
 notion that mind is in matter and that the socalled pleas
 ures and pains the birth sin sickness and death of
30212 matter are real is a mortal belief and this belief is all
 that will ever be lost

 Definition of man

 Continuing our definition of man let us remember that
30215 harmonious and immortal man has existed forever and
 is always beyond and above the mortal illu
 sion of any life substance and intelligence
30218 as existent in matter This statement is based on fact
 not fable The Science of being reveals man as perfect
 even as the Father is perfect because the Soul or Mind
30221 of the spiritual man is God the divine Principle of all
 being and because this real man is governed by Soul
 instead of sense by the law of Spirit not by the socalled
30224 laws of matter

 God is Love He is therefore the divine infinite Prin
 ciple called Person or God Mans true consciousness
30227 is in the mental not in any bodily or personal likeness
 to Spirit Indeed the body presents no proper likeness
 of divinity though mortal sense would fain have us so
30230 believe

 Mental propagation

 Even in Christian Science reproduction by Spirits
 individual ideas is but the reflection of the creative power
3031 of the divine Principle of those ideas The reflection
 through mental manifestation of the multitudinous
3033 forms of Mind which people the realm of
 the real is controlled by Mind the Principle
 governing the reflection Multiplication of Gods chil
3036 dren comes from no power of propagation in matter it
 is the reflection of Spirit

 The minutiae of lesser individualities reflect the one di
3039 vine individuality and are comprehended in and formed
 by Spirit not by material sensation Whatever reflects
 Mind Life Truth and Love is spiritually conceived and
30312 brought forth but the statement that man is conceived
 and evolved both spiritually and materially or by both
 God and man contradicts this eternal truth All the
30315 vanity of the ages can never make both these contraries
 true Divine Science lays the axe at the root of the illu
 sion that life or mind is formed by or is in the material
30318 body and Science will eventually destroy this illusion
 through the selfdestruction of all error and the beatified
 understanding of the Science of Life

 Error defined

30321 The belief that pain and pleasure life and death holi
 ness and unholiness mingle in man  that
 mortal material man is the likeness of God
30324 and is himself a creator  is a fatal error

 Mans entity spiritual

 God without the image and likeness of Himself would
 be a nonentity or Mind unexpressed He would be
30327 without a witness or proof of His own na
 ture Spiritual man is the image or idea of
 God an idea which cannot be lost nor sep
30330 arated from its divine Principle When the evidence
 before the material senses yielded to spiritual sense the
 apostle declared that nothing could alienate him from
3041 God from the sweet sense and presence of Life and
 Truth

 Man inseparable from Love

3043 It is ignorance and false belief based on a material
 sense of things which hide spiritual beauty and good
 ness Understanding this Paul said Nei
3046 ther death nor life    nor things present
 nor things to come nor height nor depth nor
 any other creature shall be able to separate us from
3049 the love of God This is the doctrine of Christian
 Science that divine Love cannot be deprived of its
 manifestation or object that joy cannot be turned into
30412 sorrow for sorrow is not the master of joy that good can
 never produce evil that matter can never produce mind
 nor life result in death The perfect man  governed
30415 by God his perfect Principle  is sinless and eternal

 Harmony natural

 Harmony is produced by its Principle is controlled
 by it and abides with it Divine Principle is the Life
30418 of man Mans happiness is not therefore at
 the disposal of physical sense Truth is not
 contaminated by error Harmony in man is as beautiful
30421 as in music and discord is unnatural unreal

 The science of music governs tones If mortals caught
 harmony through material sense they would lose har
30424 mony if time or accident robbed them of material sense
 To be master of chords and discords the science of
 music must be understood Left to the decisions
30427 of material sense music is liable to be misappre
 hended and lost in confusion Controlled by belief
 instead of understanding music is must be imper
30430 fectly expressed So man not understanding the Sci
 ence of being  thrusting aside his divine Principle as
 incomprehensible  is abandoned to conjectures left in
3051 the hands of ignorance placed at the disposal of illusions
 subjected to material sense which is discord A discon
3053 tented discordant mortal is no more a man than discord
 is music

 Human reflection

 A picture in the camera or a face reflected in the mirror
3056 is not the original though resembling it Man in the
 likeness of his Maker reflects the central light
 of being the invisible God As there is no cor
3059 poreality in the mirrored form which is but a reflection
 so man like all things real reflects God his divine Prin
 ciple not in a mortal body

30512 Gender also is a quality not of God but a character
 istic of mortal mind The verity that Gods image is not
 a creator though he reflects the creation of Mind God
30515 constitutes the underlying reality of reflection Then
 answered Jesus and said unto them Verily verily I say
 unto you the Son can do nothing of himself but what he
30518 seeth the Father do for what things soever He doeth
 these also doeth the Son likewise

 Inverted images

 The inverted images presented by the senses the de
30521 flections of matter as opposed to the Science of spirit
 ual reflection are all unlike Spirit God In
 the illusion of life that is here today and
30524 gone tomorrow man would be wholly mortal were
 it not that Love the divine Principle that obtains in
 divine Science destroys all error and brings immor
30527 tality to light Because man is the reflection of his
 Maker he is not subject to birth growth maturity de
 cay These mortal dreams are of human origin not
30530 divine

 Jewish traditions

 The Sadducees reasoned falsely about the resurrec
 tion but not so blindly as the Pharisees who believed
3061 error to be as immortal as Truth The Pharisees thought
 that they could raise the spiritual from the material They
3063 would first make life result in death and then
 resort to death to reproduce spiritual life
 Jesus taught them how death was to be overcome by
3066 spiritual Life and demonstrated this beyond cavil

 Divinity not childless

 Life demonstrates Life The immortality of Soul makes
 man immortal If God who is Life were parted for a
3069 moment from His reflection man during that
 moment there would be no divinity reflected
 The Ego would be unexpressed and the Father would be
30612 childless  no Father

 If Life or Soul and its representative man unite for
 a period and then are separated as by a law of divorce to
30615 be brought together again at some uncertain future time
 and in a manner unknown  and this is the general
 religious opinion of mankind  we are left without a
30618 rational proof of immortality But man cannot be sep
 arated for an instant from God if man reflects God
 Thus Science proves mans existence to be intact

 Thoughtforms

30621 The myriad forms of mortal thought made manifest
 as matter are not more distinct nor real to the mate
 rial senses than are the Soulcreated forms
30624 to spiritual sense which cognizes Life as per
 manent Undisturbed amid the jarring testimony of the
 material senses Science still enthroned is unfolding
30627 to mortals the immutable harmonious divine Principle
  is unfolding Life and the universe ever present and
 eternal

30630 Gods man spiritually created is not material and
 mortal

 The serpents whisper

 The parent of all human discord was the Adamdream
3071 the deep sleep in which originated the delusion that life
 and intelligence proceeded from and passed into matter
3073 This pantheistic error or socalled serpent in
 sists still upon the opposite of Truth saying
 Ye shall be as gods that is I will make error as real
3076 and eternal as Truth

 Evil still affirms itself to be mind and declares that
 there is more than one intelligence or God It says
3079 There shall be lords and gods many I declare that God
 makes evil minds and evil spirits and that I aid Him
 Truth shall change sides and be unlike Spirit I will
30712 put spirit into what I call matter and matter shall seem
 to have life as much as God Spirit who is the only life

 Bad results from error

 This error has proved itself to be error Its life is found
30715 to be not Life but only a transient false sense of an ex
 istence which ends in death Error charges
 its lie to Truth and says The Lord knows
30718 it He has made man immortal and material out of mat
 ter instead of Spirit Thus error partakes of its own
 nature and utters its own falsities If we regard matter
30721 as intelligent and Mind as both good and evil every sin
 or supposed material pain and pleasure seems normal
 a part of Gods creation and so weighs against our course
30724 Spiritward

 Higher statutes

 Truth has no beginning The divine Mind is the Soul
 of man and gives man dominion over all things Man
30727 was not created from a material basis nor
 bidden to obey material laws which Spirit never
 made his province is in spiritual statutes in the higher
30730 law of Mind

 The great question

 Above errors awful din blackness and chaos the voice
 of Truth still calls Adam where art thou Conscious
3081 ness where art thou Art thou dwelling in the belief
 that mind is in matter and that evil is mind or art thou
3083 in the living faith that there is and can be but
 one God and keeping His commandment
 Until the lesson is learned that God is the only Mind gov
3086 erning man mortal belief will be afraid as it was in the
 beginning and will hide from the demand Where art
 thou This awful demand Adam where art thou
3089 is met by the admission from the head heart stomach
 blood nerves etc Lo here I am looking for happiness
 and life in the body but finding only an illusion a blend
30812 ing of false claims false pleasure pain sin sickness and
 death

 The Soulinspired patriarchs heard the voice of Truth
30815 and talked with God as consciously as man talks with man

 Wrestling of Jacob

 Jacob was alone wrestling with error  struggling
 with a mortal sense of life substance and intelligence
30818 as existent in matter with its false pleasures
 and pains  when an angel a message from
 Truth and Love appeared to him and smote the sinew
30821 or strength of his error till he saw its unreality and
 Truth being thereby understood gave him spiritual
 strength in this Peniel of divine Science Then said
30824 the spiritual evangel Let me go for the day breaketh
 that is the light of Truth and Love dawns upon thee
 But the patriarch perceiving his error and his need
30827 of help did not loosen his hold upon this glorious light
 until his nature was transformed When Jacob was
 asked What is thy name he straightway answered
30830 and then his name was changed to Israel for as a prince
 had he prevailed and had power with God and with
 men Then Jacob questioned his deliverer Tell me
3091 I pray thee thy name but this appellation was withheld
 for the messenger was not a corporeal being but a name
3093 less incorporeal impartation of divine Love to man which
 to use the word of the Psalmist restored his Soul  gave
 him the spiritual sense of being and rebuked his material
3096 sense

 Israel the new name

 The result of Jacobs struggle thus appeared He had
 conquered material error with the understanding of Spirit
3099 and of spiritual power This changed the man
 He was no longer called Jacob but Israel 
 a prince of God or a soldier of God who had fought
30912 a good fight He was to become the father of those who
 through earnest striving followed his demonstration of the
 power of Spirit over the material senses and the children
30915 of earth who followed his example were to be called the
 children of Israel until the Messiah should rename them
 If these children should go astray and forget that Life
30918 is God good and that good is not in elements which are
 not spiritual  thus losing the divine power which heals
 the sick and sinning  they were to be brought back
30921 through great tribulation to be renamed in Christian
 Science and led to deny material sense or mind in matter
 even as the gospel teaches

 Life never structural

30924 The Science of being shows it to be impossible for in
 finite Spirit or Soul to be in a finite body or for man to
 have an intelligence separate from his Maker
30927 It is a selfevident error to suppose that there
 can be such a reality as organic animal or vegetable life
 when such socalled life always ends in death Life is
30930 never for a moment extinct Therefore it is never struc
 tural nor organic and is never absorbed nor limited by its
 own formations

 Thought seen as substance

3101 The artist is not in his painting The picture is the
 artists thought objectified The human belief fancies
3103 that it delineates thought on matter but what
 is matter Did it exist prior to thought
 Matter is made up of supposititious mortal mindforce
3106 but all might is divine Mind Thought will finally be
 understood and seen in all form substance and color but
 without material accompaniments The potter is not in
3109 the clay else the clay would have power over the potter
 God is His own infinite Mind and expresses all

 The central intelligence

 Day may decline and shadows fall but darkness flees
31012 when the earth has again turned upon its axis The sun
 is not affected by the revolution of the earth
 So Science reveals Soul as God untouched
31015 by sin and death  as the central life and intelligence
 around which circle harmoniously all things in the sys
 tems of Mind

 Soul imperishable

31018 Soul changeth not We are commonly taught that there
 is a human soul which sins and is spiritually lost  that
 soul may be lost and yet be immortal If
31021 Soul could sin Spirit Soul would be flesh in
 stead of Spirit It is the belief of the flesh and of mate
 rial sense which sins If Soul sinned Soul would die
31024 Sin is the element of selfdestruction and spiritual death
 is oblivion If there was sin in Soul the annihilation of
 Spirit would be inevitable The only Life is Spirit and
31027 if Spirit should lose Life as God good then Spirit which
 has no other existence would be annihilated

 Mind is God and God is not seen by material sense
31030 because Mind is Spirit which material sense cannot dis
 cern There is neither growth maturity nor decay in
 Soul These changes are the mutations of material sense
3111 the varying clouds of mortal belief which hide the truth
 of being

3113 What we term mortal mind or carnal mind dependent
 on matter for manifestation is not Mind God is Mind
 all that Mind God is or hath made is good and He
3116 made all Hence evil is not made and is not real

 Sin only of the flesh

 Soul is immortal because it is Spirit which has no ele
 ment of selfdestruction is man lost spiritually No
3119 he can only lose a sense material All sin is
 of the flesh It cannot be spiritual Sin exists
 here or hereafter only so long as the illusion of mind in
31112 matter remains It is a sense of sin and not a sinful soul
 which is lost Evil is destroyed by the sense of good

 Soul impeccable

 Through false estimates of soul as dwelling in sense
31115 and of mind as dwelling in matter belief strays into a
 sense of temporary loss or absence of soul spir
 itual truth This state of error is the mortal
31118 dream of life and substance as existent in matter and is
 directly opposite to the immortal reality of being So long
 as we believe that soul can sin or that immortal Soul is in
31121 mortal body we can never understand the Science of be
 ing When humanity does understand this Science it
 will become the law of Life to man  even the higher law
31124 of Soul which prevails over material sense through har
 mony and immortality

 The objects cognized by the physical senses have not
31127 the reality of substance They are only what mortal
 belief calls them Matter sin and mortality lose all
 supposed consciousness or claim to life or existence as
31130 mortals lay off a false sense of life substance and intelli
 gence but the spiritual eternal man is not touched by
 these phases of mortality

 Sensedreams

3121 How true it is that whatever is learned through material
 sense must be lost because such socalled knowledge is
3123 reversed by the spiritual facts of being in
 Science That which material sense calls
 intangible is found to be substance What to material
3126 sense seems substance becomes nothingness as the sense
 dream vanishes and reality appears

 The senses regard a corpse not as man but simply as
3129 matter People say Man is dead but this death is
 the departure of a mortals mind not of matter The
 matter is still there The belief of that mortal that he
31212 must die occasioned his departure yet you say that
 matter has caused his death

 Vain ecstasies

 People go into ecstasies over the sense of a corporeal
31215 Jehovah though with scarcely a spark of love in their
 hearts yet God is love and without Love
 God immortality cannot appear Mortals try
31218 to believe without understanding Truth yet God is
 Truth Mortals claim that death is inevitable but mans
 eternal Principle is everpresent life Mortals believe in
31221 a finite personal God while God is infinite Love which
 must be unlimited

 Manmade theories

 Our theories are based on finite premises which can
31224 not penetrate beyond matter A personal sense of God
 and of mans capabilities necessarily limits
 faith and hinders spiritual understanding It
31227 divides faith and understanding between matter and Spirit
 the finite and the infinite and so turns away from the
 intelligent and divine healing Principle to the inanimate
31230 drug

 The one anointed

 Jesus spiritual origin and his demonstration of divine
 Principle richly endowed him and entitled him to sonship
3131 in Science He was the son of a virgin The term
 Christ Jesus or Jesus the Christ to give the full and
3133 proper translation of the Greek may be ren
 dered Jesus the anointed Jesus the God
 crowned or the divinely royal man as it is said of him in
3136 the first chapter of Hebrews 
 Therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee
 With the oil of gladness above thy fellows

3139 With this agrees another passage in the same chapter
 which refers to the Son as the brightness of His Gods
 glory and the express expressed image of His person
31312 infinite Mind It is noteworthy that the phrase ex
 press image in the Common Version is in the Greek
 Testament character Using this word in its higher mean
31315 ing we may assume that the author of this remarkable
 epistle regarded Christ as the Son of God the royal
 reflection of the infinite and the cause given for the ex
31318 altation of Jesus Marys son was that he loved right
 eousness and hated iniquity The passage is made
 even clearer in the translation of the late George R
31321 Noyes DD Who being a brightness from His glory
 and an image of His being

 Jesus the Scientist

 Jesus of Nazareth was the most scientific man that
31324 ever trod the globe He plunged beneath the material
 surface of things and found the spiritual
 cause To accommodate himself to imma
31327 ture ideas of spiritual power  for spirituality was pos
 sessed only in a limited degree even by his disciples 
 Jesus called the body which by spiritual power he
31330 raised from the grave flesh and bones To show
 that the substance of himself was Spirit and the body
3141 no more perfect because of death and no less material
 until the ascension his further spiritual exaltation
3143 Jesus waited until the mortal or fleshly sense had re
 linquished the belief of substancematter and spiritual
 sense had quenched all earthly yearnings Thus he found
3146 the eternal Ego and proved that he and the Father were
 inseparable as God and His reflection or spiritual man
 Our Master gained the solution of being demonstrating
3149 the existence of but one Mind without a second or equal

 The bodily resurrection

 The Jews who sought to kill this man of God showed
 plainly that their material views were the parents of their
31412 wicked deeds When Jesus spoke of repro
 ducing his body  knowing as he did that
 Mind was the builder  and said Destroy this temple
31415 and in three days I will raise it up they thought that he
 meant their material temple instead of his body To such
 materialists the real man seemed a spectre unseen and
31418 unfamiliar and the body which they laid in a sepulchre
 seemed to be substance This materialism lost sight of
 the true Jesus but the faithful Mary saw him and he
31421 presented to her more than ever before the true idea of
 Life and substance

 Opposition of materialists

 Because of mortals material and sinful belief the
31424 spiritual Jesus was imperceptible to them The higher
 his demonstration of divine Science carried
 the problem of being and the more dis
31427 tinctly he uttered the demands of its divine Principle
 Truth and Love the more odious he became to sinners
 and to those who depending on doctrines and material
31430 laws to save them from sin and sickness were submis
 sive to death as being in supposed accord with the
 inevitable law of life Jesus proved them wrong by
3151 his resurrection and said Whosoever liveth and be
 lieveth in me shall never die

 Hebrew theology

3153 That saying of our Master I and my Father are one
 separated him from the scholastic theology of the rabbis
 His better understanding of God was a rebuke
3156 to them He knew of but one Mind and laid
 no claim to any other He knew that the Ego was Mind
 instead of body and that matter sin and evil were not
3159 Mind and his understanding of this divine Science
 brought upon him the anathemas of the age

 The true sonship

 The opposite and false views of the people hid from
31512 their sense Christs sonship with God They could not
 discern his spiritual existence Their carnal
 minds were at enmity with it Their thoughts
31515 were filled with mortal error instead of with Gods spirit
 ual idea as presented by Christ Jesus The likeness of
 God we lose sight of through sin which beclouds the spir
31518 itual sense of Truth and we realize this likeness only
 when we subdue sin and prove mans heritage the liberty
 of the sons of God

 Immaculate conception

31521 Jesus spiritual origin and understanding enabled him
 to demonstrate the facts of being  to prove irrefutably
 how spiritual Truth destroys material error
31524 heals sickness and overcomes death The
 divine conception of Jesus pointed to this truth and pre
 sented an illustration of creation The history of Jesus
31527 shows him to have been more spiritual than all other
 earthly personalities

 Jesus as mediator

 Wearing in part a human form that is as it seemed
31530 to mortal view being conceived by a human mother
 Jesus was the mediator between Spirit and the flesh
 between Truth and error Explaining and demonstrat
3161 ing the way of divine Science he became the way of
 salvation to all who accepted his word From him mor
3163 tals may learn how to escape from evil The
 real man being linked by Science to his Maker
 mortals need only turn from sin and lose sight of mortal
3166 selfhood to find Christ the real man and his relation to
 God and to recognize the divine sonship Christ Truth
 was demonstrated through Jesus to prove the power of
3169 Spirit over the flesh  to show that Truth is made
 manifest by its effects upon the human mind and body
 healing sickness and destroying sin

 Spiritual government

31612 Jesus represented Christ the true idea of God Hence
 the warfare between this spiritual idea and perfunctory
 religion between spiritual clearsightedness
31615 and the blindness of popular belief which led
 to the conclusion that the spiritual idea could be killed
 by crucifying the flesh The Christidea or the Christ
31618 man rose higher to human view because of the crucifixion
 and thus proved that truth was the master of death
 Christ presents the indestructible man whom Spirit cre
31621 ates constitutes and governs Christ illustrates that
 blending with God his divine Principle which gives man
 dominion over all the earth

 Deadness in sin

31624 The spiritual idea of God as presented by Jesus was
 scourged in person and its Principle was rejected That
 man was accounted a criminal who could
31627 prove Gods divine power by healing the
 sick casting out evils spiritualizing materialistic beliefs
 and raising the dead  those dead in trespasses and
31630 sins satisfied with the flesh resting on the basis of mat
 ter blind to the possibilities of Spirit and its correla
 tive truth
3171 Jesus uttered things which had been secret from the
 foundation of the world  since material knowledge
3173 usurped the throne of the creative divine Principle insisted
 on the might of matter the force of falsity the insignifi
 cance of spirit and proclaimed an anthropomorphic God

 The cup of Jesus

3176 Whosoever lives most the life of Jesus in this age
 and declares best the power of Christian Science will
 drink of his Masters cup Resistance to
3179 Truth will haunt his steps and he will in
 cur the hatred of sinners till wisdom is justified of
 her children These blessed benedictions rest upon
31712 Jesus followers If the world hate you ye know that
 it hated me before it hated you Lo I am with you
 alway  that is not only in all time but in all ways
31715 and conditions

 The individuality of man is no less tangible because
 it is spiritual and because his life is not at the mercy of
31718 matter The understanding of his spiritual individuality
 makes man more real more formidable in truth and en
 ables him to conquer sin disease and death Our Lord
31721 and Master presented himself to his disciples after his
 resurrection from the grave as the selfsame Jesus whom
 they had loved before the tragedy on Calvary

 Material skepticism

31724 To the materialistic Thomas looking for the ideal
 Saviour in matter instead of in Spirit and to the testi
 mony of the material senses and the body
31727 more than to Soul for an earnest of immor
 tality  to him Jesus furnished the proof that he was
 unchanged by the crucifixion To this dull and doubt
31730 ing disciple Jesus remained a fleshly reality so long as
 the Master remained an inhabitant of the earth Noth
 ing but a display of matter could make existence real
3181 to Thomas For him to believe in matter was no task
 but for him to conceive of the substantiality of Spirit 
3183 to know that nothing can efface Mind and immortality in
 which Spirit reigns  was more difficult

 What the senses originate

 Corporeal senses define diseases as realities but the
3186 Scriptures declare that God made all even while the cor
 poreal senses are saying that matter causes
 disease and the divine Mind cannot or will
3189 not heal it The material senses originate and
 support all that is material untrue selfish or debased
 They would put soul into soil life into limbo and doom
31812 all things to decay We must silence this lie of material
 sense with the truth of spiritual sense We must cause
 the error to cease that brought the belief of sin and death
31815 and would efface the pure sense of omnipotence

 Sickness as discord

 Is the sick man sinful above all others No but
 so far as he is discordant he is not the image of God
31818 Weary of their material beliefs from which
 comes so much suffering invalids grow more
 spiritual as the error  or belief that life is in matter 
31821 yields to the reality of spiritual Life

 The Science of Mind denies the error of sensation in
 matter and heals with Truth Medical science treats
31824 disease as though disease were real therefore right and
 attempts to heal it with matter If disease is right it is
 wrong to heal it Material methods are temporary and
31827 are not adapted to elevate mankind

 The governor is not subjected to the governed In
 Science man is governed by God divine Principle as
31830 numbers are controlled and proved by His laws Intelli
 gence does not originate in numbers but is manifested
 through them The body does not include soul but man
3191 ifests mortality a false sense of soul The delusion that
 there is life in matter has no kinship with the Life supernal

 Unscientific introspection

3193 Science depicts disease as error as matter versus
 Mind and error reversed as subserving the facts of
 health To calculate ones lifeprospects
3196 from a material basis would infringe upon
 spiritual law and misguide human hope Having faith
 in the divine Principle of Health and spiritually under
3199 standing God sustains man under all circumstances
 whereas the lower appeal to the general faith in material
 means commonly called nature must yield to the all
31912 might of infinite Spirit

 Throughout the infinite cycles of eternal existence
 Spirit and matter neither concur in man nor in the universe

 God the only Mind

31915 The varied doctrines and theories which presuppose
 life and intelligence to exist in matter are so many ancient
 and modern mythologies Mystery miracle
31918 sin and death will disappear when it becomes
 fairly understood that the divine Mind controls man and
 man has no Mind but God

 Scriptures misinterpreted

31921 The divine Science taught in the original language
 of the Bible came through inspiration and needs inspi
 ration to be understood Hence the misappre
31924 hension of the spiritual meaning of the Bible
 and the misinterpretation of the Word in
 some instances by uninspired writers who only wrote
31927 down what an inspired teacher had said A misplaced
 word changes the sense and misstates the Science of
 the Scriptures as for instance to name Love as merely
31930 an attribute of God but we can by special and proper
 capitalization speak of the love of Love meaning by that
 what the beloved disciple meant in one of his epistles
3201 when he said God is love Likewise we can speak of
 the truth of Truth and of the life of Life for Christ plainly
3203 declared I am the way the truth and the life

 Interior meaning

 Metaphors abound in the Bible and names are often
 expressive of spiritual ideas The most distinguished
3206 theologians in Europe and America agree that
 the Scriptures have both a spiritual and lit
 eral meaning In Smiths Bible Dictionary it is said
3209 The spiritual interpretation of Scripture must rest
 upon both the literal and moral and in the learned
 article on Noah in the same work the familiar text
32012 Genesis vi 3 And the Lord said My spirit shall not
 always strive with man for that he also is flesh is quoted
 as follows from the original Hebrew And Jehovah
32015 said My spirit shall not forever rule or be humbled in
 men seeing that they are or in their error they are
 but flesh Here the original text declares plainly the
32018 spiritual fact of being even mans eternal and harmo
 nious existence as image idea instead of matter how
 ever transcendental such a thought appears and avers
32021 that this fact is not forever to be humbled by the belief
 that man is flesh and matter for according to that error
 man is mortal

 Job on the resurrection

32024 The one important interpretation of Scripture is the
 spiritual For example the text In my flesh shall I
 see God gives a profound idea of the di
32027 vine power to heal the ills of the flesh and
 encourages mortals to hope in Him who healeth all our
 diseases whereas this passage is continually quoted
32030 as if Job intended to declare that even if disease and
 worms destroyed his body yet in the latter days he should
 stand in celestial perfection before Elohim still clad
3211 in material flesh  an interpretation which is just the op
 posite of the true as may be seen by studying the book
3213 of Job As Paul says in his first epistle to the Corin
 thians Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
 God

 Fear of the serpent overcome

3216 The Hebrew Lawgiver slow of speech despaired of
 making the people understand what should be revealed
 to him When led by wisdom to cast down his
3219 rod he saw it become a serpent Moses fled be
 fore it but wisdom bade him come back and
 handle the serpent and then Moses fear departed In
32112 this incident was seen the actuality of Science Matter
 was shown to be a belief only The serpent evil under
 wisdoms bidding was destroyed through understanding
32115 divine Science and this proof was a staff upon which to
 lean The illusion of Moses lost its power to alarm him
 when he discovered that what he apparently saw was really
32118 but a phase of mortal belief

 Leprosy healed

 It was scientifically demonstrated that leprosy was a
 creation of mortal mind and not a condition of matter
32121 when Moses first put his hand into his bosom
 and drew it forth white as snow with the dread
 disease and presently restored his hand to its natural con
32124 dition by the same simple process God had lessened
 Moses fear by this proof in divine Science and the in
 ward voice became to him the voice of God which said
32127 It shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither
 hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe
 the voice of the latter sign And so it was in the coming
32130 centuries when the Science of being was demonstrated
 by Jesus who showed his students the power of Mind by
 changing water into wine and taught them how to handle
3221 serpents unharmed to heal the sick and cast out evils in
 proof of the supremacy of Mind

 Standpoints changed

3223 When understanding changes the standpoints of life and
 intelligence from a material to a spiritual basis we shall
 gain the reality of Life the control of Soul over
3226 sense and we shall perceive Christianity or
 Truth in its divine Principle This must be the climax
 before harmonious and immortal man is obtained and his
3229 capabilities revealed It is highly important  in view
 of the immense work to be accomplished before this recog
 nition of divine Science can come  to turn our thoughts
32212 towards divine Principle that finite belief may be pre
 pared to relinquish its error

 Saving the inebriate

 Mans wisdom finds no satisfaction in sin since God
32215 has sentenced sin to suffer The necromancy of yester
 day foreshadowed the mesmerism and hypno
 tism of today The drunkard thinks he enjoys
32218 drunkenness and you cannot make the inebriate leave
 his besottedness until his physical sense of pleasure yields
 to a higher sense Then he turns from his cups as
32221 the startled dreamer who wakens from an incubus in
 curred through the pains of distorted sense A man who
 likes to do wrong  finding pleasure in it and refraining
32224 from it only through fear of consequences  is neither
 a temperate man nor a reliable religionist

 Uses of suffering

 The sharp experiences of belief in the supposititious life
32227 of matter as well as our disappointments and ceaseless
 woes turn us like tired children to the arms
 of divine Love Then we begin to learn Life
32230 in divine Science Without this process of weaning
 Canst thou by searching find out God It is easier
 to desire Truth than to rid ones self of error Mortals
3231 may seek the understanding of Christian Science but they
 will not be able to glean from Christian Science the facts
3233 of being without striving for them This strife consists
 in the endeavor to forsake error of every kind and to pos
 sess no other consciousness but good

 A bright outlook

3236 Through the wholesome chastisements of Love we
 are helped onward in the march towards righteousness
 peace and purity which are the landmarks
3239 of Science Beholding the infinite tasks of
 truth we pause  wait on God Then we push onward
 until boundless thought walks enraptured and concep
32312 tion unconfined is winged to reach the divine glory

 Need and supply

 In order to apprehend more we must put into prac
 tice what we already know We must recollect that
32315 Truth is demonstrable when understood and
 that good is not understood until demonstrated
 If faithful over a few things we shall be made rulers
32318 over many but the one unused talent decays and is lost
 When the sick or the sinning awake to realize their need
 of what they have not they will be receptive of divine
32321 Science which gravitates towards Soul and away from
 material sense removes thought from the body and ele
 vates even mortal mind to the contemplation of some
32324 thing better than disease or sin The true idea of God
 gives the true understanding of Life and Love robs the
 grave of victory takes away all sin and the delusion that
32327 there are other minds and destroys mortality

 Childlike receptivity

 The effects of Christian Science are not so much seen
 as felt It is the still small voice of Truth
32330 uttering itself We are either turning away
 from this utterance or we are listening to it and going
 up higher Willingness to become as a little child and
3241 to leave the old for the new renders thought receptive of
 the advanced idea Gladness to leave the false landmarks
3243 and joy to see them disappear  this disposition helps
 to precipitate the ultimate harmony The purification
 of sense and self is a proof of progress Blessed are the
3246 pure in heart for they shall see God

 Narrow pathway

 Unless the harmony and immortality of man are be
 coming more apparent we are not gaining the true idea
3249 of God and the body will reflect what gov
 erns it whether it be Truth or error
 understanding or belief Spirit or matter Therefore
32412 acquaint now thyself with Him and be at peace
 Be watchful sober and vigilant The way is straight
 and narrow which leads to the understanding that God
32415 is the only Life It is a warfare with the flesh in which
 we must conquer sin sickness and death either here
 or hereafter  certainly before we can reach the goal
32418 of Spirit or life in God

 Pauls enlightenment

 Paul was not at first a disciple of Jesus but a perse
 cutor of Jesus followers When the truth first appeared
32421 to him in Science Paul was made blind
 and his blindness was felt but spiritual
 light soon enabled him to follow the example and teach
32424 ings of Jesus healing the sick and preaching Christian
 ity throughout Asia Minor Greece and even in imperial
 Rome

32427 Paul writes If Christ Truth be not risen then is
 our preaching vain That is if the idea of the suprem
 acy of Spirit which is the true conception of being
32430 come not to your thought you cannot be benefited by
 what I say

 Abiding in Life

 Jesus said substantially He that believeth in me
3251 shall not see death That is he who perceives the
 true idea of Life loses his belief in death He who has
3253 the true idea of good loses all sense of evil
 and by reason of this is being ushered into the
 undying realities of Spirit Such a one abideth in Life 
3256 life obtained not of the body incapable of supporting life
 but of Truth unfolding its own immortal idea Jesus
 gave the true idea of being which results in infinite bless
3259 ings to mortals

 Indestructible being

 In Colossians iii 4 Paul writes When Christ who
 is our life shall appear be manifested then shall ye also
32512 appear be manifested with him in glory
 When spiritual being is understood in all its
 perfection continuity and might then shall man be found
32515 in Gods image The absolute meaning of the apostolic
 words is this Then shall man be found in His likeness
 perfect as the Father indestructible in Life hid with
32518 Christ in God  with Truth in divine Love where
 human sense hath not seen man

 Consecration required

 Paul had a clear sense of the demands of Truth upon
32521 mortals physically and spiritually when he said Pre
 sent your bodies a living sacrifice holy ac
 ceptable unto God which is your reasonable
32524 service But he who is begotten of the beliefs of the
 flesh and serves them can never reach in this world the
 divine heights of our Lord The time cometh when
32527 the spiritual origin of man the divine Science which
 ushered Jesus into human presence will be understood
 and demonstrated

32530 When first spoken in any age Truth like the light
 shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended
 it not A false sense of life substance and mind
3261 hides the divine possibilities and conceals scientific
 demonstration

 Loving God supremely

3263 If we wish to follow Christ Truth it must be in the
 way of Gods appointing Jesus said He that believeth
 on me the works that I do shall he do also
3266 He who would reach the source and find the
 divine remedy for every ill must not try to climb the hill
 of Science by some other road All nature teaches Gods
3269 love to man but man cannot love God supremely and set
 his whole affections on spiritual things while loving the
 material or trusting in it more than in the spiritual

32612 We must forsake the foundation of material systems
 however timehonored if we would gain the Christ as
 our only Saviour Not partially but fully the great
32615 healer of mortal mind is the healer of the body

 The purpose and motive to live aright can be gained
 now This point won you have started as you should
32618 You have begun at the numerationtable of Christian
 Science and nothing but wrong intention can hinder your
 advancement Working and praying with true motives
32621 your Father will open the way Who did hinder you
 that ye should not obey the truth

 Conversion of Saul

 Saul of Tarsus beheld the way  the Christ or Truth
32624  only when his uncertain sense of right yielded to a
 spiritual sense which is always right Then
 the man was changed Thought assumed a
32627 nobler outlook and his life became more spiritual He
 learned the wrong that he had done in persecuting Chris
 tians whose religion he had not understood and in hu
32630 mility he took the new name of Paul He beheld for the
 first time the true idea of Love and learned a lesson in
 divine Science

3271 Reform comes by understanding that there is no abid
 ing pleasure in evil and also by gaining an affection for
3273 good according to Science which reveals the immortal
 fact that neither pleasure nor pain appetite nor passion
 can exist in or of matter while divine Mind can and does
3276 destroy the false beliefs of pleasure pain or fear and all
 the sinful appetites of the human mind

 Image of the beast

 What a pitiful sight is malice finding pleasure in re
3279 venge Evil is sometimes a mans highest conception
 of right until his grasp on good grows stronger
 Then he loses pleasure in wickedness and it
32712 becomes his torment The way to escape the misery of
 sin is to cease sinning There is no other way Sin is
 the image of the beast to be effaced by the sweat of agony
32715 It is a moral madness which rushes forth to clamor with
 midnight and tempest

 Peremptory demands

 To the physical senses the strict demands of Christian
32718 Science seem peremptory but mortals are has
 tening to learn that Life is God good and that
 evil has in reality neither place nor power in the human or
32721 the divine economy

 Moral courage

 Fear of punishment never made man truly honest
 Moral courage is requisite to meet the wrong and to
32724 proclaim the right But how shall we re
 form the man who has more animal than
 moral courage and who has not the true idea of good
32727 Through human consciousness convince the mortal of
 his mistake in seeking material means for gaining hap
 piness Reason is the most active human faculty Let
32730 that inform the sentiments and awaken the mans dor
 mant sense of moral obligation and by degrees he will
 learn the nothingness of the pleasures of human sense
3281 and the grandeur and bliss of a spiritual sense which
 silences the material or corporeal Then he not only will
3283 be saved but is saved

 Final destruction of error

 Mortals suppose that they can live without goodness
 when God is good and the only real Life What is the
3286 result Understanding little about the divine
 Principle which saves and heals mortals get
 rid of sin sickness and death only in belief These errors
3289 are not thus really destroyed and must therefore cling
 to mortals until here or hereafter they gain the true un
 derstanding of God in the Science which destroys human
32812 delusions about Him and reveals the grand realities of
 His allness

 Promise perpetual

 This understanding of mans power when he is
32815 equipped by God has sadly disappeared from Christian
 history For centuries it has been dormant a
 lost element of Christianity Our missionaries
32818 carry the Bible to India but can it be said that they
 explain it practically as Jesus did when hundreds of
 persons die there annually from serpentbites Under
32821 standing spiritual law and knowing that there is no mate
 rial law Jesus said These signs shall follow them that
 believe    they shall take up serpents and if they
32824 drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them They
 shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover It
 were well had Christendom believed and obeyed this
32827 sacred saying

 Jesus promise is perpetual Had it been given only
 to his immediate disciples the Scriptural passage would
32830 read you not they The purpose of his great lifework
 extends through time and includes universal humanity
 Its Principle is infinite reaching beyond the pale of a
3291 single period or of a limited following As time moves
 on the healing elements of pure Christianity will be fairly
3293 dealt with they will be sought and taught and will glow
 in all the grandeur of universal goodness

 Imitation of Jesus

 A little leaven leavens the whole lump A little under
3296 standing of Christian Science proves the truth of all that
 I say of it Because you cannot walk on the
 water and raise the dead you have no right to
3299 question the great might of divine Science in these direc
 tions Be thankful that Jesus who was the true demon
 strator of Science did these things and left his example for
32912 us In Science we can use only what we understand We
 must prove our faith by demonstration

 One should not tarry in the storm if the body is freez
32915 ing nor should he remain in the devouring flames Un
 til one is able to prevent bad results he should avoid their
 occasion To be discouraged is to resemble a pupil in
32918 addition who attempts to solve a problem of Euclid and
 denies the rule of the problem because he fails in his first
 effort

 Error destroyed not pardoned

32921 There is no hypocrisy in Science Principle is impera
 tive You cannot mock it by human will Science is a
 divine demand not a human Always right
32924 its divine Principle never repents but main
 tains the claim of Truth by quenching error
 The pardon of divine mercy is the destruction of error If
32927 men understood their real spiritual source to be all bless
 edness they would struggle for recourse to the spiritual
 and be at peace but the deeper the error into which mor
32930 tal mind is plunged the more intense the opposition to
 spirituality till error yields to Truth

 The hopeful outlook

 Human resistance to divine Science weakens in pro
3301 portion as mortals give up error for Truth and the un
 derstanding of being supersedes mere belief Until the
3303 author of this book learned the vastness of
 Christian Science the fixedness of mortal illu
 sions and the human hatred of Truth she cherished
3306 sanguine hopes that Christian Science would meet with
 immiediate and universal acceptance

 When the following platform is understood and the
3309 letter and the spirit bear witness the infallibility of divine
 metaphysics will be demonstrated

 The deific supremacy

 I God is infinite the only Life substance Spirit or
33012 Soul the only intelligence of the universe including man
 Eye hath neither seen God nor His image and
 likeness Neither God nor the perfect man
33015 can be discerned by the material senses The individ
 uality of Spirit or the infinite is unknown and thus a
 knowledge of it is left either to human conjecture or to the
33018 revelation of divine Science

 The deific definitions

 II God is what the Scriptures declare Him to be 
 Life Truth Love Spirit is divine Principle and divine
33021 Principle is Love and Love is Mind and
 Mind is not both good and bad for God is
 Mind therefore there is in reality one Mind only be
33024 cause there is one God

 Evil obsolete

 III The notion that both evil and good are real is a
 delusion of material sense which Science annihilates
33027 Evil is nothing no thing mind nor power
 As manifested by mankind it stands for a lie
 nothing claiming to be something  for lust dishonesty
33030 selfishness envy hypocrisy slander hate theft adultery
 murder dementia insanity inanity devil hell with all
 the etceteras that word includes

 Life the creator

3311 IV God is divine Life and Life is no more confined
 to the forms which reflect it than substance is in its
3313 shadow If life were in mortal man or mate
 rial things it would be subject to their limi
 tations and would end in death Life is Mind the creator
3316 reflected in His creations If He dwelt within what He
 creates God would not be reflected but absorbed and the
 Science of being would be forever lost through a mortal
3319 sense which falsely testifies to a beginning and an
 end

 Allness of Spirit

 V The Scriptures imply that God is Allinall From
33112 this it follows that nothing possesses reality nor existence
 except the divine Mind and His ideas The
 Scriptures also declare that God is Spirit
33115 Therefore in Spirit all is harmony and there can be no
 discord all is Life and there is no death Everything
 in Gods universe expresses Him

 The universal cause

33118 VI God is individual incorporeal He is divine Prin
 ciple Love the universal cause the only creator and
 there is no other selfexistence He is all
33121 inclusive and is reflected by all that is real
 and eternal and by nothing else He fills all space and
 it is impossible to conceive of such omnipresence and in
33124 dividuality except as infinite Spirit or Mind Hence all
 is Spirit and spiritual

 Divine trinity

 VII Life Truth and Love constitute the triune Person
33127 called God  that is the triply divine Principle Love
 They represent a trinity in unity three in
 one  the same in essence though multi
33130 form in office God the FatherMother Christ the spirit
 ual idea of sonship divine Science or the Holy Comforter
 These three express in divine Science the threefold essen
3321 tial nature of the infinite They also indicate the divine
 Principle of scientific being the intelligent relation of God
3323 to man and the universe

 FatherMother

 VIII FatherMother is the name for Deity which in
 dicates His tender relationship to His spiritual creation
3326 As the apostle expressed it in words which he
 quoted with approbation from a classic poet
 For we are also His offspring

 The Son of God

3329 IX Jesus was born of Mary Christ is the true idea
 voicing good the divine message from God to men speak
 ing to the human consciousness The Christ
33212 is incorporeal spiritual  yea the divine
 image and likeness dispelling the illusions of the senses
 the Way the Truth and the Life healing the sick and
33215 casting out evils destroying sin disease and death As
 Paul says There is one God and one mediator between
 God and men the man Christ Jesus The corporeal
33218 man Jesus was human

 Holy Ghost or Comforter

 X Jesus demonstrated Christ he proved that Christ
 is the divine idea of God  the Holy Ghost
33221 or Comforter revealing the divine Principle
 Love and leading into all truth

 Christ Jesus

 XI Jesus was the son of a virgin He was appointed
33224 to speak Gods word and to appear to mortals in such
 a form of humanity as they could understand
 as well as perceive Marys conception of
33227 him was spiritual for only purity could reflect Truth
 and Love which were plainly incarnate in the good and
 pure Christ Jesus He expressed the highest type of
33230 divinity which a fleshly form could express in that age
 Into the real and ideal man the fleshly element cannot
 enter Thus it is that Christ illustrates the coincidence
3331 or spiritual agreement between God and man in His
 image

 Messiah or Christ

3333 XII The word Christ is not properly a synonym for
 Jesus though it is commonly so used Jesus was a human
 name which belonged to him in common with
3336 other Hebrew boys and men for it is identical
 with the name Joshua the renowned Hebrew leader On
 the other hand Christ is not a name so much as the divine
3339 title of Jesus Christ expresses Gods spiritual eternal
 nature The name is synonymous with Messiah and al
 ludes to the spirituality which is taught illustrated and
33312 demonstrated in the life of which Christ Jesus was the
 embodiment The proper name of our Master in the
 Greek was Jesus the Christ but Christ Jesus better sig
33315 nifies the Godlike

 The divine Principle and idea

 XIII The advent of Jesus of Nazareth marked the
 first century of the Christian era but the Christ is
33318 without beginning of years or end of days
 Throughout all generations both before and
 after the Christian era the Christ as the spirit
33321 ual idea  the reflection of God  has come with some
 measure of power and grace to all prepared to receive
 Christ Truth Abraham Jacob Moses and the prophets
33324 caught glorious glimpses of the Messiah or Christ which
 baptized these seers in the divine nature the essence of
 Love The divine image idea or Christ was is and
33327 ever will be inseparable from the divine Principle God
 Jesus referred to this unity of his spiritual identity thus
 Before Abraham was I am I and my Father are
33330 one My Father is greater than I The one Spirit
 includes all identities

 Spiritual oneness

 XIV By these sayings Jesus meant not that the hu
3341 man Jesus was or is eternal but that the divine idea or
 Christ was and is so and therefore antedated Abraham
3343 not that the corporeal Jesus was one with the
 Father but that the spiritual idea Christ
 dwells forever in the bosom of the Father God from
3346 which it illumines heaven and earth not that the Father
 is greater than Spirit which is God but greater infinitely
 greater than the fleshly Jesus whose earthly career was
3349 brief

 The Sons duality

 XV The invisible Christ was imperceptible to the
 socalled personal senses whereas Jesus appeared as a
33412 bodily existence This dual personality of the
 unseen and the seen the spiritual and mate
 rial the eternal Christ and the corporeal Jesus manifest
33415 in flesh continued until the Masters ascension when
 the human material concept or Jesus disappeared
 while the spiritual self or Christ continues to exist in
33418 the eternal order of divine Science taking away the sins
 of the world as the Christ has always done even before
 the human Jesus was incarnate to mortal eyes

 Eternity of the Christ

33421 XVI This was the Lamb slain from the foundation
 of the world  slain that is according to the testi
 mony of the corporeal senses but undying in
33424 the deific Mind The Revelator represents the
 Son of man as saying Revelation i 17 18 I am the
 first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead
33427 not understood and behold I am alive for evermore
 Science has explained me This is a mystical state
 ment of the eternity of the Christ and is also a reference
33430 to the human sense of Jesus crucified

 Infinite Spirit

 XVII Spirit being God there is but one Spirit for
 there can be but one infinite and therefore one God
3351 There are neither spirits many nor gods many There
 is no evil in Spirit because God is Spirit The theory
3353 that Spirit is distinct from matter but must
 pass through it or into it to be individualized
 would reduce God to dependency on matter and establish
3356 a basis for pantheism

 The only substance

 XVIII Spirit God has created all in and of Him
 self Spirit never created matter There is nothing in
3359 Spirit out of which matter could be made
 for as the Bible declares without the Logos
 the AEon or Word of God was not anything made
33512 that was made Spirit is the only substance the in
 visible and indivisible infinite God Things spiritual and
 eternal are substantial Things material and temporal
33515 are insubstantial

 Soul and Spirit one

 XIX Soul and Spirit being one God and Soul are
 one and this one never included in a limited mind or a
33518 limited body Spirit is eternal divine Noth
 ing but Spirit Soul can evolve Life for Spirit
 is more than all else Because Soul is immortal it does
33521 not exist in mortality Soul must be incorporeal to be
 Spirit for Spirit is not finite Only by losing the false
 sense of Soul can we gain the eternal unfolding of Life as
33524 immortality brought to light

 The one divine Mind

 XX Mind is the divine Principle Love and can pro
 duce nothing unlike the eternal FatherMother God
33527 Reality is spiritual harmonious immutable
 immortal divine eternal Nothing unspirit
 ual can be real harmonious or eternal Sin sickness
33530 and mortality are the suppositional antipodes of Spirit
 and must be contradictions of reality

 The divine Ego

 XXI The Ego is deathless and limitless for limits
3361 would imply and impose ignorance Mind is the I AM
 or infinity Mind never enters the finite Intelligence
3363 never passes into nonintelligence or matter
 Good never enters into evil the unlimited into
 the limited the eternal into the temporal nor the im
3366 mortal into mortality The divine Ego or individuality
 is reflected in all spiritual individuality from the infini
 tesimal to the infinite

 The real manhood

3369 XXII Immortal man was and is Gods image or idea
 even the infinite expression of infinite Mind and immor
 tal man is coexistent and coeternal with that
33612 Mind He has been forever in the eternal
 Mind God but infinite Mind can never be in man but
 is reflected by man The spiritual mans consciousness
33615 and individuality are reflections of God They are the
 emanations of Him who is Life Truth and Love Im
 mortal man is not and never was material but always
33618 spiritual and eternal

 Indivisibility of the infinite

 XXIII God is indivisible A portion of God could
 not enter man neither could Gods fulness be reflected
33621 by a single man else God would be manifestly
 finite lose the deific character and become
 less than God Allness is the measure of the infinite and
33624 nothing less can express God

 God the parent Mind

 XXIV God the divine Principle of man and man in
 Gods likeness are inseparable harmonious and eternal
33627 The Science of being furnishes the rule of per
 fection and brings immortality to light God
 and man are not the same but in the order of divine Sci
33630 ence God and man coexist and are eternal God is the
 parent Mind and man is Gods spiritual offspring

 Man reflects the perfect God

 XXV God is individual and personal in a scientific
3371 sense but not in any anthropomorphic sense Therefore
 man reflecting God cannot lose his individuality but as
3373 material sensation or a soul in the body blind
 mortals do lose sight of spiritual individuality
 Material personality is not realism it is not
3376 the reflection or likeness of Spirit the perfect God Sen
 sualism is not bliss but bondage For true happiness
 man must harmonize with his Principle divine Love the
3379 Son must be in accord with the Father in conformity with
 Christ According to divine Science man is in a degree
 as perfect as the Mind that forms him The truth of be
33712 ing makes man harmonious and immortal while error is
 mortal and discordant

 Purity the path to perfection

 XXVI Christian Science demonstrates that none but
33715 the pure in heart can see God as the gospel
 teaches In proportion to his purity is man
 perfect and perfection is the order of celestial
33718 being which demonstrates Life in Christ Lifes spiritual
 ideal

 True idea of man

 XXVII The true idea of man as the reflection of the
33721 invisible God is as incomprehensible to the limited senses
 as is mans infinite Principle The visible uni
 verse and material man are the poor counter
33724 feits of the invisible universe and spiritual man Eternal
 things verities are Gods thoughts as they exist in the
 spiritual realm of the real Temporal things are the
33727 thoughts of mortals and are the unreal being the oppo
 site of the real or the spiritual and eternal

 Truth demonstrated

 XXVIII Subject sickness sin and death to the rule
33730 of health and holiness in Christian Science
 and you ascertain that this Science is demon
 strably true for it heals the sick and sinning as no
3381 other system can Christian Science rightly under
 stood leads to eternal harmony It brings to light the
3383 only living and true God and man as made in His like
 ness whereas the opposite belief  that man originates
 in matter and has beginning and end that he is both
3386 soul and body both good and evil both spiritual and
 material  terminates in discord and mortality in the
 error which must be destroyed by Truth The mortality
3389 of material man proves that error has been ingrafted
 into the premises and conclusions of material and mortal
 humanity

 Adam not ideal man

33812 XXIX The word Adam is from the Hebrew adamah
 signifying the red color of the ground dust nothingness
 Divide the name Adam into two syllables
33815 and it reads a dam or obstruction This
 suggests the thought of something fluid of mortal mind
 in solution It further suggests the thought of that
33818  darkness    upon the face of the deep when mat
 ter or dust was deemed the agent of Deity in creating
 man  when matter as that which is accursed stood
33821 opposed to Spirit Here a dam is not a mere play upon
 words it stands for obstruction error even the sup
 posed separation of man from God and the obstacle
33824 which the serpent sin would impose between man and
 his creator The dissection and definition of words
 aside from their metaphysical derivation is not scien
33827 tific Jehovah declared the ground was accursed and
 from this ground or matter sprang Adam notwith
 standing God had blessed the earth for mans sake
33830 From this it follows that Adam was not the ideal man
 for whom the earth was blessed The ideal man was
 revealed in due time and was known as Christ Jesus

 Divine pardon

3391 XXX The destruction of sin is the divine method of
 pardon Divine Life destroys death Truth destroys
3393 error and Love destroys hate Being de
 stroyed sin needs no other form of forgiveness
 Does not Gods pardon destroying any one sin prophesy
3396 and involve the final destruction of all sin

 Evil not produced by God

 XXXI Since God is All there is no room for His
 unlikeness God Spirit alone created all and called it
3399 good Therefore evil being contrary to good
 is unreal and cannot be the product of God
 A sinner can receive no encouragement from the fact that
33912 Science demonstrates the unreality of evil for the sinner
 would make a reality of sin  would make that real
 which is unreal and thus heap up wrath against the
33915 day of wrath He is joining in a conspiracy against
 himself  against his own awakening to the awful un
 reality by which he has been deceived Only those who
33918 repent of sin and forsake the unreal can fully understand
 the unreality of evil

 Basis of health and immortality

 XXXII As the mythology of pagan Rome has yielded
33921 to a more spiritual idea of Deity so will our material
 theories yield to spiritual ideas until the finite
 gives place to the infinite sickness to health
33924 sin to holiness and Gods kingdom comes in
 earth as it is in heaven The basis of all health sin
 lessness and immortality is the great fact that God is
33927 the only Mind and this Mind must be not merely be
 lieved but it must be understood To get rid of sin
 through Science is to divest sin of any supposed mind
33930 or reality and never to admit that sin can have intelli
 gence or power pain or pleasure You conquer error by
 denying its verity Our various theories will never lose
3401 their imaginary power for good or evil until we lose our
 faith in them and make life its own proof of harmony
3403 and God

 This text in the book of Ecclesiastes conveys the
 Christian Science thought especially when the word
3406 duty which is not in the original is omitted Let
 us hear the conclusion of the whole matter Fear God
 and keep His commandments for this is the whole
3409 duty of man In other words Let us hear the con
 clusion of the whole matter love God and keep His
 commandments for this is the whole of man in His
34012 image and likeness Divine Love is infinite Therefore
 all that really exists is in and of God and manifests His
 love

34015 Thou shalt have no other gods before me Exodus
 xx 3 The First Commandment is my favorite text
 It demonstrates Christian Science It inculcates the tri
34018 unity of God Spirit Mind it signifies that man shall
 have no other spirit or mind but God eternal good and
 that all men shall have one Mind The divine Principle
34021 of the First Commandment bases the Science of being by
 which man demonstrates health holiness and life eternal
 One infinite God good unifies men and nations con
34024 stitutes the brotherhood of man ends wars fulfils the
 Scripture Love thy neighbor as thyself annihilates
 pagan and Christian idolatry  whatever is wrong in
34027 social civil criminal political and religious codes
 equalizes the sexes annuls the curse on man and leaves
 nothing that can sin suffer be punished or destroyed




 CHAPTER XI  SOME OBJECTIONS ANSWERED

 And because I tell you the truth ye believe me not
 Which of you convinceth me of sin And if I say the truth
 why do ye not believe me  JESUS

 But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead
 dwell in you He that raised up Christ from the dead shall
 also quicken your mortal bodies by His spirit that dwelleth
 in you  PAUL

3411 THE strictures on this volume would condemn to
 oblivion the truth which is raising up thousands
3413 from helplessness to strength and elevating them from
 a theoretical to a practical Christianity These criticisms
 are generally based on detached sentences or clauses sep
3416 arated from their context Even the Scriptures which
 grow in beauty and consistency from one grand root ap
 pear contradictory when subjected to such usage Jesus
3419 said Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see
 God Truth

 Supported by facts

 In Christian Science mere opinion is valueless Proof
34112 is essential to a due estimate of this subject Sneers at
 the application of the word Science to Chris
 tianity cannot prevent that from being scien
34115 tific which is based on divine Principle demonstrated ac
 cording to a divine given rule and subjected to proof
 The facts are so absolute and numerous in support of
34118 Christian Science that misrepresentation and denuncia
3421 tion cannot overthrow it Paul alludes to doubtful dis
 putations The hour has struck when proof and demon
3423 stration instead of opinion and dogma are summoned to
 the support of Christianity making wise the simple

 Commands of Jesus

 In the result of some unqualified condemnations of
3426 scientific Mindhealing one may see with sorrow the sad
 effects on the sick of denying Truth He that
 decries this Science does it presumptuously
3429 in the face of Bible history and in defiance of the direct
 command of Jesus Go ye into all the world and preach
 the gospel to which command was added the promise
34212 that his students should cast out evils and heal the sick
 He bade the seventy disciples as well as the twelve
 heal the sick in any town where they should be hospitably
34215 received

 Christianity scientific

 If Christianity is not scientific and Science is not of
 God then there is no invariable law and truth becomes
34218 an accident Shall it be denied that a system
 which works according to the Scriptures has
 Scriptural authority

 Argument of good works

34221 Christian Science awakens the sinner reclaims the
 infidel and raises from the couch of pain the helpless
 invalid It speaks to the dumb the words of
34224 Truth and they answer with rejoicing It
 causes the deaf to hear the lame to walk and the blind
 to see Who would be the first to disown the Christli
34227 ness of good works when our Master says By their
 fruits ye shall know them

 If Christian Scientists were teaching or practising
34230 pharmacy or obstetrics according to the common theo
 ries no denunciations would follow them even if their
 treatment resulted in the death of a patient The people
3431 are taught in such cases to say Amen Shall I then be
 smitten for healing and for teaching Truth as the Prin
3433 ciple of healing and for proving my word by my deed
 James said Show me thy faith without thy works and
 I will show thee my faith by my works

 Personal experience

3436 Is not finite mind ignorant of Gods method This
 makes it doubly unfair to impugn and misrepresent the
 facts although without this crossbearing
3439 one might not be able to say with the apostle
 None of these things move me The sick the halt
 and the blind look up to Christian Science with blessings
34312 and Truth will not be forever hidden by unjust parody
 from the quickened sense of the people

 Proof from miracles

 Jesus strips all disguise from error when his teachings
34315 are fully understood By parable and argument he ex
 plains the impossibility of good producing evil
 and he also scientifically demonstrates this great
34318 fact proving by what are wrongly called miracles that
 sin sickness and death are beliefs  illusive errors 
 which he could and did destroy
34321 It would sometimes seem as if truth were rejected be
 cause meekness and spirituality are the conditions of its
 acceptance while Christendom generally demands so
34324 much less

 Example of the disciples

 Anciently those apostles who were Jesus students
 as well as Paul who was not one of his students healed
34327 the sick and reformed the sinner by their
 religion Hence the mistake which allows
 words rather than works to follow such examples
34330 Whoever is the first meekly and conscientiously to press
 along the line of gospelhealing is often accounted a
 heretic

 Strong position

3441 It is objected to Christian Science that it claims God
 as the only absolute Life and Soul and man to be His
3443 idea  that is His image It should be
 added that this is claimed to represent the
 normal healthful and sinless condition of man in divine
3446 Science and that this claim is made because the Scrip
 tures say that God has created man in His own image
 and after His likeness Is it sacrilegious to assume that
3449 Gods likeness is not found in matter sin sickness and
 death

 Efficacy may be attested

 Were it more fully understood that Truth heals and
34412 that error causes disease the opponents of a demonstrable
 Science would perhaps mercifully withhold
 their misrepresentations which harm the sick
34415 and until the enemies of Christian Science test its efficacy
 according to the rules which disclose its merits or de
 merits it would be just to observe the Scriptural precept
34418 Judge not

 The one divine method

 There are various methods of treating disease which
 are not included in the commonly accepted systems but
34421 there is only one which should be presented
 to the whole world and that is the Christian
 Science which Jesus preached and practised and left to us
34424 as his rich legacy

 Why should one refuse to investigate this method
 of treating disease Why support the popular systems
34427 of medicine when the physician may perchance be an
 infidel and may lose ninetyandnine patients while
 Christian Science cures its hundred Is it because
34430 allopathy and homoeopathy are more fashionable and
 less spiritual

 Omnipotence set forth

 In the Bible the word Spirit is so commonly applied
3451 to Deity that Spirit and God are often regarded as syn
 onymous terms and it is thus they are uniformly used
3453 and understood in Christian Science As it
 is evident that the likeness of Spirit cannot be
 material does it not follow that God cannot be in His
3456 unlikeness and work through drugs to heal the sick
 When the omnipotence of God is preached and His ab
 soluteness is set forth Christian sermons will heal the
3459 sick

 Contradictions not found

 It is sometimes said in criticising Christian Science
 that the mind which contradicts itself neither knows
34512 itself nor what it is saying It is indeed no
 small matter to know ones self but in this
 volume of mine there are no contradictory
34515 statements  at least none which are apparent to those
 who understand its propositions well enough to pass
 judgment upon them One who understands Christian
34518 Science can heal the sick on the divine Principle of Chris
 tian Science and this practical proof is the only feasible
 evidence that one does understand this Science

34521 Anybody who is able to perceive the incongruity be
 tween Gods idea and poor humanity ought to be able
 to discern the distinction made by Christian Science
34524 between Gods man made in His image and the sinning
 race of Adam

 The apostle says For if a man think himself to be
34527 something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself
 This thought of human material nothingness which
 Science inculcates enrages the carnal mind and is the
34530 main cause of the carnal minds antagonism

 Gods idea the ideal man

 It is not the purpose of Christian Science to educate
 the idea of God or treat it for disease as is alleged
3461 by one critic I regret that such criticism confounds man
 with Adam When man is spoken of as made in Gods
3463 image it is not sinful and sickly mortal man
 who is referred to but the ideal man reflecting
 Gods likeness

 Nothingness of error

3466 It is sometimes said that Christian Science teaches the
 nothingness of sin sickness and death and then teaches
 how this nothingness is to be saved and healed
3469 The nothingness of nothing is plain but we
 need to understand that error is nothing and that its
 nothingness is not saved but must be demonstrated in
34612 order to prove the somethingness  yea the allness 
 of Truth It is selfevident that we are harmonious only
 as we cease to manifest evil or the belief that we suffer
34615 from the sins of others Disbelief in error destroys error
 and leads to the discernment of Truth There are no
 vacuums How then can this demonstration be fraught
34618 with falsities painful to behold

 Truth antidotes error

 We treat error through the understanding of Truth
 because Truth is errors antidote If a dream ceases it
34621 is selfdestroyed and the terror is over When
 a sufferer is convinced that there is no reality
 in his belief of pain  because matter has no sensation
34624 hence pain in matter is a false belief  how can he suffer
 longer Do you feel the pain of toothpulling when you
 believe that nitrousoxide gas has made you unconscious
34627 Yet in your concept the tooth the operation and the
 forceps are unchanged

 Serving two masters

 Material beliefs must be expelled to make room for
34630 spiritual understanding We cannot serve both
 God and mammon at the same time but is
 not this what frail mortals are trying to do Paul says
3471 The flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against
 the flesh Who is ready to admit this

3473 It is said by one critic that to verify this wonderful
 philosophy Christian Science declares that whatever is
 mortal or discordant has no origin existence nor real
3476 ness Nothing really has Life but God who is infinite
 Life hence all is Life and death has no dominion This
 writer infers that if anything needs to be doctored it
3479 must be the one God or Mind Had he stated his syllo
 gism correctly the conclusion would be that there is noth
 ing left to be doctored

 Essential element of Christianity

34712 Critics should consider that the socalled mortal man
 is not the reality of man Then they would behold the
 signs of Christs coming Christ as the spir
34715 itual or true idea of God comes now as of
 old preaching the gospel to the poor heal
 ing the sick and casting out evils Is it error which
34718 is restoring an essential element of Christianity 
 namely apostolic divine healing No it is the Science
 of Christianity which is restoring it and is the light
34721 shining in darkness which the darkness comprehends
 not

 If Christian Science takes away the popular gods 
34724 sin sickness and death  it is Christ Truth who de
 stroys these evils and so proves their nothingness

 The dream that matter and error are something
34727 must yield to reason and revelation Then mortals
 will behold the nothingness of sickness and sin and
 sin and sickness will disappear from consciousness
34730 The harmonious will appear real and the inharmo
 nious unreal These critics will then see that error
 is indeed the nothingness which they chide us for
3481 naming nothing and which we desire neither to honor
 nor to fear

3483 Medical theories virtually admit the nothingness of
 hallucinations even while treating them as disease and
 who objects to this Ought we not then to approve
3486 any cure which is effected by making the disease appear
 to be  what it really is  an illusion

 All disease a delusion

 Here is the difficulty it is not generally understood how
3489 one disease can be just as much a delusion as another It
 is a pity that the medical faculty and clergy
 have not learned this for Jesus established
34812 this foundational fact when devils delusions were cast
 out and the dumb spake

 Elimination of sickness

 Are we irreverent towards sin or imputing too much
34815 power to God when we ascribe to Him almighty Life
 and Love I deny His cooperation with evil
 because I desire to have no faith in evil or in
34818 any power but God good Is it not well to eliminate from
 socalled mortal mind that which so long as it remains in
 mortal mind will show itself in forms of sin sickness and
34821 death Instead of tenaciously defending the supposed
 rights of disease while complaining of the suffering dis
 ease brings would it not be well to abandon the defence
34824 especially when by so doing our own condition can be im
 proved and that of other persons as well

 Full fruitage yet to come

 I have never supposed the world would immediately
34827 witness the full fruitage of Christian Science or that sin
 disease and death would not be believed for
 an indefinite time but this I do aver that
34830 as a result of teaching Christian Science ethics and
 temperance have received all impulse health has been
 restored and longevity increased If such are the pres
3491 ent fruits what will the harvest be when this Science is
 more generally understood

 Law and gospel

3493 As Paul asked of the unfaithful in ancient days so
 the rabbis of the present day ask concerning our heal
 ing and teaching Through breaking the law
3496 dishonorest thou God We have the gospel
 however and our Master annulled material law by heal
 ing contrary to it We propose to follow the Masters
3499 example We should subordinate material law to spirit
 ual law Two essential points of Christian Science are
 that neither Life nor man dies and that God is not the
34912 author of sickness

 Language inadequate

 The chief difficulty in conveying the teachings of divine
 Science accurately to human thought lies in this that like
34915 all other languages English is inadequate to
 the expression of spiritual conceptions and
 propositions because one is obliged to use material terms
34918 in dealing with spiritual ideas The elucidation of Chris
 tian Science lies in its spiritual sense and this sense must
 be gained by its disciples in order to grasp the meaning of
34921 this Science Out of this condition grew the prophecy
 concerning the Christian apostles They shall speak with
 new tongues

34924 Speaking of the things of Spirit while dwelling on
 a material plane material terms must be generally em
 ployed Mortal thought does not at once catch the
34927 higher meaning and can do so only as thought is edu
 cated up to spiritual apprehension To a certain extent
 this is equally true of all learning even that which is
34930 wholly material

 Substance spiritual

 In Christian Science substance is understood to be
 Spirit while the opponents of Christian Science believe
3501 substance to be matter They think of matter as some
 thing and almost the only thing and of the things which
3503 pertain to Spirit as next to nothing or as very
 far removed from daily experience Christian
 Science takes exactly the opposite view

 Both words and works

3506 To understand all our Masters sayings as recorded
 in the New Testament sayings infinitely important
 his followers must grow into that stature of
3509 manhood in Christ Jesus which enables them
 to interpret his spiritual meaning Then they know
 how Truth casts out error and heals the sick His
35012 words were the offspring of his deeds both of which
 must be understood Unless the works are com
 prehended which his words explained the words are
35015 blind

 The Master often refused to explain his words because
 it was difficult in a material age to apprehend spiritual
35018 Truth He said This peoples heart is waxed gross
 and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they
 have closed lest at any time they should see with their
35021 eyes and hear with their ears and should understand
 with their heart and should be converted and I should
 heal them

 The divine lifelink

35024 The Word was made flesh Divine Truth must be
 known by its effects on the body as well as on the mind
 before the Science of being can be demon
35027 strated Hence its embodiment in the incar
 nate Jesus  that lifelink forming the connection through
 which the real reaches the unreal Soul rebukes sense and
35030 Truth destroys error

 Truth a present help

 In Jewish worship the Word was materially explained
 and the spiritual sense was scarcely perceived The
3511 religion which sprang from halfhidden Israelitish history
 was pedantic and void of healing power When we lose
3513 faith in Gods power to heal we distrust the
 divine Principle which demonstrates Christian
 Science and then we cannot heal the sick Neither can
3516 we heal through the help of Spirit if we plant ourselves
 on a material basis

 The author became a member of the orthodox Con
3519 gregational Church in early years Later she learned
 that her own prayers failed to heal her as did the prayers
 of her devout parents and the church but when the
35112 spiritual sense of the creed was discerned in the Science
 of Christianity this spiritual sense was a present help It
 was the living palpitating presence of Christ Truth which
35115 healed the sick

 Fatal premises

 We cannot bring out the practical proof of Christianity
 which Jesus required while error seems as potent and
35118 real to us as Truth and while we make a per
 sonal devil and an anthropomorphic God our
 startingpoints  especially if we consider Satan as a
35121 being coequal in power with Deity if not superior to Him
 Because such startingpoints are neither spiritual nor
 scientific they cannot work out the Spiritrule of Christian
35124 healing which proves the nothingness of error discord
 by demonstrating the allinclusiveness of harmonious
 Truth

 Fruitless worship

35127 The Israelites centred their thoughts on the material
 in their attempted worship of the spiritual To them
 matter was substance and Spirit was shadow
35130 They thought to worship Spirit from a ma
 terial standpoint but this was impossible They might
 appeal to Jehovah but their prayer brought down no
3521 proof that it was heard because they did not sufficiently
 understand God to be able to demonstrate His power
3523 to heal  to make harmony the reality and discord the
 unreality

 Spirit the tangible

 Our Master declared that his material body was not
3526 spirit evidently considering it a mortal and material be
 lief of flesh and bones whereas the Jews took
 a diametrically opposite view To Jesus not
3529 materiality but spirituality was the reality of mans ex
 istence while to the rabbis the spiritual was the intangi
 ble and uncertain if not the unreal

 Ghosts not realities

35212 Would a mother say to her child who is frightened at
 imaginary ghosts and sick in consequence of the fear
 I know that ghosts are real They exist
35215 and are to be feared but you must not be
 afraid of them

 Children like adults ought to fear a reality which
35218 can harm them and which they do not understand for
 at any moment they may become its helpless victims
 but instead of increasing childrens fears by declaring
35221 ghosts to be real merciless and powerful thus water
 ing the very roots of childish timidity children should
 be assured that their fears are groundless that ghosts
35224 are not realities but traditional beliefs erroneous and
 manmade

 In short children should be told not to believe in ghosts
35227 because there are no such things If belief in their reality
 is destroyed terror of ghosts will depart and health be re
 stored The objects of alarm will then vanish into noth
35230 ingness no longer seeming worthy of fear or honor To
 accomplish a good result it is certainly not irrational to
 tell the truth about ghosts

 The real and the unreal

3531 The Christianly scientific real is the sensuous unreal
 Sin disease whatever seems real to material sense is un
3533 real in divine Science The physical senses
 and Science have ever been antagonistic and
 they will so continue till the testimony of the physical
3536 senses yields entirely to Christian Science

 How can a Christian having the stronger evidence of
 Truth which contradicts the evidence of error think of
3539 the latter as real or true either in the form of sickness or
 of sin All must admit that Christ is the way the
 truth and the life and that omnipotent Truth certainly
35312 does destroy error

 Superstition obsolete

 The age has not wholly outlived the sense of ghostly
 beliefs It still holds them more or less Time has not
35315 yet reached eternity immortality complete
 reality All the real is eternal Perfection
 underlies reality Without perfection nothing is wholly
35318 real All things will continue to disappear until per
 fection appears and reality is reached We must give up
 the spectral at all points We must not continue to admit
35321 the somethingness of superstition but we must yield up
 all belief in it and be wise When we learn that error
 is not real we shall be ready for progress forgetting
35324 those things which are behind

 The grave does not banish the ghost of materiality
 So long as there are supposed limits to Mind and those
35327 limits are human so long will ghosts seem to continue
 Mind is limitless It never was material The true idea
 of being is spiritual and immortal and from this it follows
35330 that whatever is laid off is the ghost some unreal belief
 Mortal beliefs can neither demonstrate Christianity nor
 apprehend the reality of Life

 Christian warfare

3541 Are the protests of Christian Science against the notion
 that there can be material life substance or mind utter
3543 falsities and absurdities as some aver Why
 then do Christians try to obey the Scriptures
 and war against the world the flesh and the devil
3546 Why do they invoke the divine aid to enable them to leave
 all for Christ Truth Why do they use this phraseology
 and yet deny Christian Science when it teaches precisely
3549 this thought The words of divine Science find their
 immortality in deeds for their Principle heals the sick
 and spiritualizes humanity

 Healing omitted

35412 On the other hand the Christian opponents of Chris
 tian Science neither give nor offer any proofs that their
 Masters religion can heal the sick Surely
35415 it is not enough to cleave to barren and desul
 tory dogmas derived from the traditions of the elders who
 thereunto have set their seals

 Scientific consistency

35418 Consistency is seen in example more than in precept
 Inconsistency is shown by words without deeds which
 are like clouds without rain If our words
35421 fail to express our deeds God will redeem that
 weakness and out of the mouth of babes He will perfect
 praise The night of materiality is far spent and with
35424 the dawn Truth will waken men spiritually to hear and
 to speak the new tongue

 Sin should become unreal to every one It is in itself
35427 inconsistent a divided kingdom Its supposed realism
 has no divine authority and I rejoice in the apprehension
 of this grand verity

 Spiritual meaning

35430 The opponents of divine Science must be
 charitable if they would be Christian If the
 letter of Christian Science appears inconsistent they should
3551 gain the spiritual meaning of Christian Science and then
 the ambiguity will vanish

 Practical arguments

3553 The charge of inconsistency in Christianly scientific
 methods of dealing with sin and disease is met by some
 thing practical  namely the proof of the
3556 utility of these methods and proofs are better
 than mere verbal arguments or prayers which evince no
 spiritual power to heal

3559 As for sin and disease Christian Science says in the
 language of the Master Follow me and let the dead
 bury their dead Let discord of every name and nature
35512 be heard no more and let the harmonious and true sense
 of Life and being take possession of human consciousness

 What is the relative value of the two conflicting the
35515 ories regarding Christian healing One according to
 the commands of our Master heals the sick The other
 popular religion declines to admit that Christs religion
35518 has exercised any systematic healing power since the first
 century

 Conditions of criticism

 The statement that the teachings of Christian Sci
35521 ence in this work are absolutely false and the most
 egregious fallacies ever offered for accept
 ance is an opinion wholly due to a misap
35524 prehension both of the divine Principle and practice of
 Christian Science and to a consequent inability to demon
 strate this Science Without this understanding no one
35527 is capable of impartial or correct criticism because demon
 stration and spiritual understanding are Gods immortal
 keynotes proved to be such by our Master and evidenced
35530 by the sick who are cured and by the sinners who are
 reformed

 Weakness of material theories

 Strangely enough we ask for material theories in sup
3561 port of spiritual and eternal truths when the two are so
 antagonistic that the material thought must become spir
3563 itualized before the spiritual fact is attained
 Socalled material existence affords no evidence
 theories of spiritual existence and immortality Sin
3566 sickness and death do not prove mans entity or immor
 tality Discord can never establish the facts of harmony
 Matter is not the vestibule of Spirit

 Irreconciliable differences

3569 Jesus reasoned on this subject practically and con
 trolled sickness sin and death on the basis of his spir
 ituality Understanding the nothingness of
35612 material things he spoke of flesh and Spirit
 as the two opposites  as error and Truth not contrib
 uting in any way to each others happiness and existence
35615 Jesus knew It is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
 profiteth nothing

 Copartnership impossible

 There is neither a present nor an eternal copartner
35618 ship between error and Truth between flesh and Spirit
 God is as incapable of producing sin sick
 ness and death as He is of experiencing these
35621 errors How then is it possible for Him to create man
 subject to this triad of errors  man who is made in the
 divine likeness

35624 Does God create a material man out of Himself Spirit
 Does evil proceed from good Does divine Love com
 mit a fraud on humanity by making man inclined to sin
35627 and then punishing him for it Would any one call it
 wise and good to create the primitive and then punish its
 derivative

 Two infinite creators absurd

35630 Does subsequent follow its antecedent It does
 Was there original selfcreative sin Then there must
 have been more than one creator more than one God
3571 In common justice we must admit that God will not
 punish man for doing what He created man
3573 capable of doing and knew from the outset
 that man would do God is of purer eyes
 than to behold evil We sustain Truth not by accept
3576 ing but by rejecting a lie

 Jesus said of personified evil that it was a liar and
 the father of it Truth creates neither a lie a capacity
3579 to lie nor a liar If mankind would relinquish the belief
 that God makes sickness sin and death or makes man
 capable of suffering on account of this malevolent triad
35712 the foundations of error would be sapped and errors de
 struction ensured but if we theoretically endow mortals
 with the creativeness and authority of Deity how dare we
35715 attempt to destroy what He hath made or even to deny
 that God made man evil and made evil good

 Anthropomorphism

 History teaches that the popular and false notions
35718 about the Divine Being and character have originated
 in the human mind As there is in reality but
 one God one Mind wrong notions about God
35721 must have originated in a false supposition not in im
 mortal Truth and they are fading out They are false
 claims which will eventually disappear according to the
35724 vision of St John in the Apocalypse

 One supremacy

 If what opposes God is real there must be two
 powers and God is not supreme and infinite Can
35727 Deity be almighty if another mighty and
 selfcreative cause exists and sways man
 kind Has the Father Life in Himself as the Scrip
35730 tures say and if so can Life or God dwell in evil and
 create it Can matter drive Life Spirit hence and so
 defeat omnipotence

 Matter impotent

3581 Is the woodmans axe which destroys a trees socalled
 life superior to omnipotence Can a leaden bullet de
3583 prive a man of Life  that is of God who is
 mans Life If God is at the mercy of matter
 then matter is omnipotent Such doctrines are confu
3586 sion worse confounded If two statements directly con
 tradict each other and one is true the other must be false
 Is Science thus contradictory

 Scientific and Biblical facts

3589 Christian Science understood coincides with the
 Scriptures and sustains logically and demonstratively
 every point it presents Otherwise it would
35812 not be Science and could not present its
 proofs Christian Science is neither made up of contra
 dictory aphorisms nor of the inventions of those who scoff
35815 at God It presents the calm and clear verdict of Truth
 against error uttered and illustrated by the prophets
 by Jesus by his apostles as is recorded throughout the
35818 Scriptures

 Why are the words of Jesus more frequently cited
 for our instruction than are his remarkable works Is
35821 it not because there are few who have gained a true
 knowledge of the great import to Christianity of those
 works

 Personal confidence

35824 Sometimes it is said Rest assured that whatever
 effect Christian Scientists may have on the sick comes
 through rousing within the sick a belief
35827 that in the removal of disease these healers
 have wonderful power derived from the Holy Ghost
 Is it likely that churchmembers have more faith in
35830 some Christian Scientist whom they have perhaps
 never seen and against whom they have been warned
 than they have in their own accredited and orthodox
3591 pastors whom they have seen and have been taught
 to love and to trust

3593 Let any clergyman try to cure his friends by their
 faith in him Will that faith heal them Yet Scien
 tists will take the same cases and cures will follow
3596 Is this because the patients have more faith in the Scien
 tist than in their pastor I have healed infidels whose
 only objection to this method was that I as a Chris
3599 tian Scientist believed in the Holy Spirit while they the
 patients did not

 Even though you aver that the material senses are
35912 indispensable to mans existence or entity you must
 change the human concept of life and must at length
 know yourself spiritually and scientifically The evi
35915 dence of the existence of Spirit Soul is palpable only to
 spiritual sense and is not apparent to the material senses
 which cognize only that which is the opposite of Spirit

35918 True Christianity is to be honored wherever found
 but when shall we arrive at the goal which that word
 implies From Puritan parents the discov
35921 erer of Christian Science early received her
 religious education In childhood she often listened
 with joy to these words falling from the lips of her
35924 saintly mother God is able to raise you up from sick
 ness and she pondered the meaning of that Scripture
 she so often quotes And these signs shall follow them
35927 that believe    they shall lay hands on the sick
 and they shall recover

 Two different artists

 A Christian Scientist and an opponent are like two
35930 artists One says I have spiritual ideals
 indestructible and glorious When others see
 them as I do in their true light and loveliness  and
3601 know that these ideals are real and eternal because drawn
 from Truth  they will find that nothing is lost and all
3603 is won by a right estimate of what is real

 The other artist replies You wrong my experience
 I have no mindideals except those which are both mental
3606 and material It is true that materiality renders these
 ideals imperfect and destructible yet I would not ex
 change mine for thine for mine give me such personal
3609 pleasure and they are not so shockingly transcendental
 They require less selfabnegation and keep Soul well out
 of sight Moreover I have no notion of losing my old
36012 doctrines or human opinions

 Choose ye today

 Dear reader which mindpicture or externalized thought
 shall be real to you  the material or the spiritual
36015 Both you cannot have You are bringing out
 your own ideal This ideal is either temporal
 or eternal Either Spirit or matter is your model If you
36018 try to have two models then you practically have none
 Like a pendulum in a clock you will be thrown back and
 forth striking the ribs of matter and swinging between the
36021 real and the unreal

 Hear the wisdom of Job as given in the excellent trans
 lation of the late Rev George R Noyes DD 
36024 Shall mortal man be more just than God
 Shall man be more pure than his Maker
 Behold He putteth no trust in His ministering spirits
36027 And His angels He chargeth with frailty

 Of old the Jews put to death the Galilean Prophet
 the best Christian on earth for the truth he spoke and
36030 demonstrated while today Jew and Christian can unite
 in doctrine and denomination on the very basis of Jesus
 words and works The Jew believes that the Messiah or
3611 Christ has not yet come the Christian believes that
 Christ is God Here Christian Science intervenes ex
3613 plains these doctrinal points cancels the disagreement
 and settles the question Christ as the true spiritual idea
 is the ideal of God now and forever here and everywhere
3616 The Jew who believes in the First Commandment is a
 monotheist he has one omnipresent God Thus the Jew
 unites with the Christians doctrine that God is come and
 is present now and forever The Christian who believes
 in the First Commandment is a monotheist This he
 virtually unites with the Jews belief in one God and
36112 recognizes that Jesus Christ is not God as Jesus himself
 declared but is the Son of God This declaration of
 Jesus understood conflicts not at all with another of his
36115 sayings I and my Father are one  that is one in
 quality not in quantity As a drop of water is one with
 the ocean a ray of light one with the sun even so God
36118 and man Father and son are one in being The Scrip
 ture reads For in Him we live and move and have
 our being

36121 I have revised Science and Health only to give a
 clearer and fuller expression of its original meaning Spir
 itual ideas unfold as we advance A human perception of
36124 divine Science however limited must be correct in order
 to be Science and subject to demonstration A germ of in
 finite Truth though least in the kingdom of heaven is the
36127 higher hope on earth but it will be rejected and reviled
 until God prepares the soil for the seed That which
 when sown bears immortal fruit enriches mankind only
36130 when it is understood  hence the many readings given
 the Scriptures and the requisite revisions of Science and
 Health with Key to the Scriptures




 CHAPTER XII  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PRACTICE

 Why art thou cast down O my soul sense
 And why art thou disquieted within me
 Hope thou in God for I shall yet praise Him
 Who is the health of my countenance and my God  PSALMS

 And these signs shall follow them that believe In my name
 shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues
 they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly
 thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the
 sick and they shall recover  JESUS

 A gospel narrative

3621 IT is related in the seventh chapter of Lukes Gospel
 that Jesus was once the honored guest of a certain
3623 Pharisee by name Simon though he was quite unlike
 Simon the disciple While they were at meat an unusual
 incident occurred as if to interrupt the scene
3626 of Oriental festivity A strange woman
 came in Heedless of the fact that she was debarred from
 such a place and such society especially under the stern
3629 rules of rabbinical law as positively as if she were a Hin
 doo pariah intruding upon the household of a highcaste
 Brahman this woman Mary Magdalene as she has
36212 since been called approached Jesus According to the
 custom of those days he reclined on a couch with his
 head towards the table and his bare feet away from it
36215 It was therefore easy for the Magdalen to come behind
3631 the couch and reach his feet She bore an alabaster jar
 containing costly and fragrant oil  sandal oil perhaps
3633 which is in such common use in the East Breaking
 the sealed jar she perfumed Jesus feet with the oil
 wiping them with her long hair which hung loosely
3636 about her shoulders as was customary with women of her
 grade

 Parable of the creditor

 Did Jesus spurn the woman Did he repel her adora
3639 tion No He regarded her compassionately Nor was
 this all Knowing what those around him
 were saying in their hearts especially his host
36312  that they were wondering why being a prophet the
 exalted guest did not at once detect the womans immoral
 status and bid her depart  knowing this Jesus rebuked
36315 them with a short story or parable He described two
 debtors one for a large sum and one for a smaller who
 were released from their obligations by their common
36318 creditor Which of them will love him most was the
 Masters question to Simon the Pharisee and Simon re
 plied He to whom he forgave most Jesus approved
36321 the answer and so brought home the lesson to all follow
 ing it with that remarkable declaration to the woman
 Thy sins are forgiven

 Divine insight

36324 Why did he thus summarize her debt to divine Love
 Had she repented and reformed and did his insight
 detect this unspoken moral uprising She
36327 bathed his feet with her tears before she
 anointed them with the oil In the absence of other
 proofs was her grief sufficient evidence to warrant the
36330 expectation of her repentance reformation and growth
 in wisdom Certainly there was encouragement in the
 mere fact that she was showing her affection for a man
3641 of undoubted goodness and purity who has since been
 rightfully regarded as the best man that ever trod this
3643 planet Her reverence was unfeigned and it was mani
 fested towards one who was soon though they knew it
 not to lay down his mortal existence in behalf of all
3646 sinners that through his word and works they might be
 redeemed from sensuality and sin

 Penitence or hospitality

 Which was the higher tribute to such ineffable affec
3649 tion the hospitality of the Pharisee or the contrition of
 the Magdalen This query Jesus answered
 by rebuking selfrighteousness and declaring
36412 the absolution of the penitent He even said that this
 poor woman had done what his rich entertainer had neg
 lected to do  wash and anoint his guests feet a special
36415 sign of Oriental courtesy

 Here is suggested a solemn question a question indi
 cated by one of the needs of this age Do Christian
36418 Scientists seek Truth as Simon sought the Saviour through
 material conservatism and for personal homage Jesus
 told Simon that such seekers as he gave small reward
36421 in return for the spiritual purgation which came through
 the Messiah If Christian Scientists are like Simon
 then it must be said of them also that they love
36424 little

 Genuine repentance

 On the other hand do they show their regard for
 Truth or Christ by their genuine repentance by their
36427 broken hearts expressed by meekness and
 human affection as did this woman If
 so then it may be said of them as Jesus said of the
36430 unwelcome visitor that they indeed love much because
 much is forgiven them

 Compassion requisite

 Did the careless doctor the nurse the cook and the
3651 brusque business visitor sympathetically know the thorns
 they plant in the pillow of the sick and the heavenly
3653 homesick looking away from earth  Oh did
 they know  this knowledge would do much
 more towards healing the sick and preparing their helpers
3656 for the midnight call than all cries of Lord Lord
 The benign thought of Jesus finding utterance in such
 words as Take no thought for your life would heal
3659 the sick and so enable them to rise above the supposed
 necessity for physical thoughttaking and doctoring
 but if the unselfish affections be lacking and common
36512 sense and common humanity are disregarded what men
 tal quality remains with which to evoke healing from
 the outstretched arm of righteousness

 Speedy healing

36515 If the Scientist reaches his patient through divine
 Love the healing work will be accomplished at one
 visit and the disease will vanish into its native
36518 nothingness like dew before the morning sun
 shine If the Scientist has enough Christly affection to
 win his own pardon and such commendation as the Mag
36521 dalen gained from Jesus then he is Christian enough to
 practise scientifically and deal with his patients compas
 sionately and the result will correspond with the spiritual
36524 intent

 Truth desecrated

 If hypocrisy stolidity inhumanity or vice finds its
 way into the chambers of disease through the wouldbe
36527 healer it would if it were possible convert
 into a den of thieves the temple of the Holy
 Ghost  the patients spiritual power to resuscitate him
36530 self The unchristian practitioner is not giving to mind
 or body the joy and strength of Truth The poor suf
 fering heart needs its rightful nutriment such as peace
3661 patience in tribulation and a priceless sense of the dear
 Fathers lovingkindness

 Moral evils to be cast out

3663 In order to cure his patient the metaphysician
 must first cast moral evils out of himself and thus
 attain the spiritual freedom which will en
3666 able him to cast physical evils out of his
 patient but heal he cannot while his own spiritual
 barrenness debars him from giving drink to the thirsty
3669 and hinders him from reaching his patients thought 
 yea while mental penury chills his faith and under
 standing

 The true physician

36612 The physician who lacks sympathy for his fellow
 being is deficient in human affection and we have the
 apostolic warrant for asking He that loveth
36615 not his brother whom he hath seen how can
 he love God whom he hath not seen Not having this
 spiritual affection the physician lacks faith in the divine
36618 Mind and has not that recognition of infinite Love which
 alone confers the healing power Such socalled Scien
 tists will strain out gnats while they swallow the camels
36621 of bigoted pedantry

 Source of calmness

 The physician must also watch lest he be over
 whelmed by a sense of the odiousness of sin and by the
36624 unveiling of sin in his own thoughts The
 sick are terrified by their sick beliefs and
 sinners should be affrighted by their sinful beliefs but
36627 the Christian Scientist will be calm in the presence of
 both sin and disease knowing as he does that Life is
 God and God is All

 Genuine healing

36630 If we would open their prison doors for the sick we
 must first learn to bind up the brokenhearted If we
 would heal by the Spirit we must not hide the talent
3671 of spiritual healing under the napkin of its form nor
 bury the morale of Christian Science in the graveclothes
3673 of its letter The tender word and Christian
 encouragement of an invalid pitiful patience
 with his fears and the removal of them are better than
3676 hecatombs of gushing theories stereotyped borrowed
 speeches and the doling of arguments which are but so
 many parodies on legitimate Christian Science aflame
3679 with divine Love

 Gratitude and humility

 This is what is meant by seeking Truth Christ not
 for the loaves and fishes nor like the Pharisee with
36712 the arrogance of rank and display of scholar
 ship but like Mary Magdalene from the sum
 mit of devout consecration with the oil of gladness and
36715 the perfume of gratitude with tears of repentance and
 with those hairs all numbered by the Father

 The salt of the earth

 A Christian Scientist occupies the place at this period
36718 of which Jesus spoke to his disciples when he said Ye
 are the salt of the earth Ye are the light
 of the world A city that is set on an hill can
36721 not be hid Let us watch work and pray that this salt
 lose not its saltness and that this light be not hid but
 radiate and glow into noontide glory

36724 The infinite Truth of the Christcure has come to this
 age through a still small voice through silent utter
 ances and divine anointing which quicken and increase
36727 the beneficial effects of Christianity I long to see the
 consummation of my hope namely the students higher
 attainments in this line of light

 Real and counterfeit

36730 Because Truth is infinite error should be known as
 nothing Because Truth is omnipotent in goodness
 error Truths opposite has no might Evil is but the
3681 counterpoise of nothingness The greatest wrong is
 but a supposititious opposite of the highest right The
3683 confidence inspired by Science lies in the fact
 that Truth is real and error is unreal Error
 is a coward before Truth Divine Science insists that
3686 time will prove all this Both truth and error have come
 nearer than ever before to the apprehension of mortals
 and truth will become still clearer as error is self
3689 destroyed

 Results of faith in Truth

 Against the fatal beliefs that error is as real as Truth
 that evil is equal in power to good if not superior and that
36812 discord is as normal as harmony even the hope
 of freedom from the bondage of sickness and
 sin has little inspiration to nerve endeavor When we
36815 come to have more faith in the truth of being than we have
 in error more faith in Spirit than in matter more faith
 in living than in dying more faith in God than in man
36818 then no material suppositions can prevent us from healing
 the sick and destroying error

 Life independent of matter

 That Life is not contingent on bodily conditions is
36821 proved when we learn that life and man survive this
 body Neither evil disease nor death can be
 spiritual and the material belief in them dis
36824 appears in the ratio of ones spiritual growth Because
 matter has no consciousness or Ego it cannot act its
 conditions are illusions and these false conditions are the
36827 source of all seeming sickness Admit the existence of
 matter and you admit that mortality and therefore dis
 ease has a foundation in fact Deny the existence of
 matter and you can destroy the belief in material con
 ditions When fear disappears the foundation of disease
 is gone Once let the mental physician believe in the
3691 reality of matter and he is liable to admit also the reality
 of all discordant conditions and this hinders his de
3693 stroying them Thus he is unfitted for the successful
 treatment of disease

 Mans entity

 In proportion as matter loses to human sense all en
3696 tity as man in that proportion does man become its
 master He enters into a diviner sense of the
 facts and comprehends the theology of Jesus
3699 as demonstrated in healing the sick raising the dead
 and walking over the wave All these deeds manifested
 Jesus control over the belief that matter is substance
36912 that it can be the arbiter of life or the constructor of any
 form of existence

 The Christ treatment

 We never read that Luke or Paul made a reality of
36915 disease in order to discover some means of healing it
 Jesus never asked if disease were acute or
 chronic and he never recommended atten
36918 tion to laws of health never give drugs never prayed
 to know if God were willing that a man should live He
 understood man whose life is God to be immortal and
36921 knew that man has not two lives one to be destroyed and
 the other to be made indestructible

 Matter not medicine

 The prophylactic and therapeutic that is the prevent
36924 ive and curative arts belong emphatically to Christian
 Science as would be readily seen if psychology
 or the Science of Spirit God was understood
36927 Unscientific methods are finding their dead level Lim
 ited to matter by their own law what have they of the
 advantages of Mind and immortality

 No healing in sin

36930 No man is physically healed in wilful error or by it
 any more than he is morally saved in or by sin It is
 error even to murmur or to be angry over sin To be
3701 every whit whole man must be better spiritually as well
 as physically To be immortal we must forsake the
3703 mortal sense of things turn from the lie of false
 belief to Truth and gather the facts of being
 from the divine Mind The body improves under the
3706 same regimen which spiritualizes the thought and if
 health is not made manifest under this regimen this
 proves that fear is governing the body This is the law
3709 of cause and effect or like producing like

 Like curing like

 Homoeopathy furnishes the evidence to the senses that
 symptoms which might be produced by a certain drug
37012 are removed by using the same drug which
 might cause the symptoms This confirms
 my theory that faith in the drug is the sole factor in the
37015 cure The effect which mortal mind produces through
 one belief it removes through an opposite belief but it
 uses the same medicine in both cases
37018 The moral and spiritual facts of health whispered
 into thought produce very direct and marked effects on
 the body A physical diagnosis of disease  since mor
37021 tal mind must be the cause of disease  tends to induce
 disease

 Transient potency of drugs

 According to both medical testimony and individual
37024 experience a drug may eventually lose its supposed power
 and do no more for the patient Hygienic
 treatment also loses its efficacy Quackery
37027 likewise fails at length to inspire the credulity
 of the sick and then they cease to improve These les
 sons are useful They should naturally and genuinely
37030 change our basis from sensation to Christian Science
 from error to Truth from matter to Spirit

 Diagnosis of matter

 Physicians examine the pulse tongue lungs to dis
3711 cover the condition of matter when in fact all is
 Mind The body is the substratum of mortal mind
3713 and this socalled mind must finally yield
 to the mandate of immortal Mind

 Ghoststories inducing fear

 Disquisitions on disease have a mental effect similar
3716 to that produced on children by telling ghoststories in
 the dark By those uninstructed in Christian
 Science nothing is really understood of material
3719 existence Mortals are believed to be here without their
 consent and to be removed as involuntarily not knowing
 why nor when As frightened children look everywhere
37112 for the imaginary ghost so sick humanity sees danger in
 every direction and looks for relief in all ways except the
 right one Darkness induces fear The adult in bond
37115 age to his beliefs no more comprehends his real being
 than does the child and the adult must be taken out of
 his darkness before he can get rid of the illusive suffer
37118 ings which throng the gloaming The way in divine
 Science is the only way out of this condition

 Mind imparts purity health and beauty

 I would not transform the infant at once into a
37121 man nor would I keep the suckling a lifelong babe
 No impossible thing do I ask when urging
 the claims of Christian Science but because
37124 this teaching is in advance of the age we
 should not deny our need of its spiritual unfoldment
 Mankind will improve through Science and Christi
37127 anity The necessity for uplifting the race is father to
 the fact that Mind can do it for Mind can impart
 purity instead of impurity strength instead of weak
37130 ness and health instead of disease Truth is an altera
 tive in the entire system and can make it every whit
 whole

 Brain not intelligent

3721 Remember brain is not mind Matter cannot be sick
 and Mind is immortal The mortal body is only an erro
3723 neous mortal belief of mind in matter What
 you call matter was originally error in solu
 tion elementary mortal mind  likened by Milton to
3726 chaos and old night One theory about this mortal
 mind is that its sensations can reproduce man can form
 blood flesh and bones The Science of being in which
3729 all is divine Mind or God and His idea would be clearer
 in this age but for the belief that matter is the medium
 of man or that man can enter his own embodied thought
37212 bind himself with his own beliefs and then call his bonds
 material and name them divine law

 Veritable success

 When man demonstrates Christian Science absolutely
37215 he will be perfect He can neither sin suffer be subject
 to matter nor disobey the law of God There
 fore he will be as the angels in heaven Chris
37218 tian Science and Christianity are one How then in
 Christianity any more than in Christian Science can we
 believe in the reality and power of both Truth and error
37221 Spirit and matter and hope to succeed with contraries
 Matter is not selfsustaining Its false supports fail one
 after another Matter succeeds for a period only by
37224 falsely parading in the vestments of law

 Recognition of benefits

 Whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also
 deny before my Father which is in heaven In Chris
37227 tian Science a denial of Truth is fatal while
 a just acknowledgment of Truth and of what
 it has done for us is an effectual help If pride super
37230 stition or any error prevents the honest recognition of
 benefits received this will be a hindrance to the recovery
 of the sick and the success of the student

 Disease far more docile than iniquity

3731 If we are Christians on all moral questions but are in
 darkness as to the physical exemption which Christian
3733 ity includes then we must have more faith
 in God on this subject and be more alive to
 His promises It is easier to cure the most
3736 malignant disease than it is to cure sin The author has
 raised up the dying partly because they were willing to
 be restored while she has struggled long and perhaps in
3739 vain to lift a student out of a chronic sin Under all
 modes of pathological treatment the sick recover more
 rapidly from disease than does the sinner from his sin
37312 Healing is easier than teaching if the teaching is faithfully
 done

 Love frees from fear

 The fear of disease and the love of sin are the sources
37315 of mans enslavement The fear of the Lord
 is the beginning of wisdom but the Scriptures
 also declare through the exalted thought of John that
37318 perfect Love casteth out fear

 The fear occasioned by ignorance can be cured but
 to remove the effects of fear produced by sin you must
37321 rise above both fear and sin Disease is expressed not
 so much by the lips as in the functions of the body Es
 tablish the scientific sense of health and you relieve the
37324 oppressed organ The inflammation decomposition or
 deposit will abate and the disabled organ will resume its
 healthy functions

 Mind circulates blood

37327 When the blood rushes madly through the veins or
 languidly creeps along its frozen channels we call these
 conditions disease This is a misconception
37330 Mortal mind is producing the propulsion or the
 languor and we prove this to be so when by mental means
 the circulation is changed and returns to that standard
3741 which mortal mind has decided upon as essential for
 health Anodynes counterirritants and depletion never
3743 reduce inflammation scientifically but the truth of being
 whispered into the ear of mortal mind will bring relief

 Mind can destroy all ills

 Hatred and its effects on the body are removed by
3746 Love Because mortal mind seems to be conscious the
 sick say How can my mind cause a disease
 I never thought of and knew nothing about
3749 until it appeared on my body The author has an
 swered this question in her explanation of disease as origi
 nating in human belief before it is consciously apparent
37412 on the body which is in fact the objective state of mortal
 mind though it is called matter This mortal blindness
 and its sharp consequences show our need of divine meta
37415 physics Through immortal Mind or Truth we can
 destroy all ills which proceed from mortal mind

 Ignorance of the cause or approach of disease is no
37418 argument against the mental origin of disease You con
 fess to ignorance of the future and incapacity to preserve
 your own existence and this belief helps rather than
37421 hinders disease Such a state of mind induces sickness
 It is like walking in darkness on the edge of a precipice
 You cannot forget the belief of danger and your steps
37424 are less firm because of your fear and ignorance of mental
 cause and effect

 Temperature is mental

 Heat and cold are products of mortal mind The body
37427 when bereft of mortal mind at first cools and after
 wards it is resolved into its primitive mortal
 elements Nothing that lives ever dies and
37430 vice versa Mortal mind produces animal heat and then
 expels it through the abandonment of a belief or in
 creases it to the point of selfdestruction Hence it is
3751 mortal mind not matter which says I die Heat
 would pass from the body as painlessly as gas dissipates
3753 into the air when it evaporates but for the belief that in
 flammation and pain must accompany the separation of
 heat from the body

 Science versus hypnotism

3756 Chills and heat are often the form in which fever mani
 fests itself Change the mental state and the chills and
 fever disappear The oldschool physician
3759 proves this when his patient says  I am better
 but the patient believes that matter not mind
 has helped him The Christian Scientist demonstrates
37512 that divine Mind heals while the hypnotist dispossesses
 the patient of his individuality in order to control him
 No person is benefited by yielding his mentality to any
37515 mental despotism or malpractice All unscientific mental
 practice is erroneous and powerless and should be under
 stood and so rendered fruitless The genuine Christian
37518 Scientist is adding to his patients mental and moral power
 and is increasing his patients spirituality while restoring
 him physically through divine Love

 Cure for palsy

37521 Palsy is a belief that matter governs mortals and can
 paralyze the body making certain portions of
 it motionless Destroy the belief show mortal
37524 mind that muscles have no power to be lost for Mind is
 supreme and you cure the palsy

 Latent fear diagnosed

 Consumptive patients always show great hopeful
37527 ness and courage even when they are supposed to be in
 hopeless danger This state of mind seems
 anomalous except to the expert in Christian
37530 Science This mental state is not understood simply
 because it is a stage of fear so excessive that it amounts
 to fortitude The belief in consumption presents to mor
3761 tal thought a hopeless state an image more terrifying than
 that of most other diseases The patient turns involun
3763 tarily from the contemplation of it but though unacknowl
 edged the latent fear and the despair of recovery remain
 in thought

 Insidious concepts

3766 Just so is it with the greatest sin It is the most subtle
 and does its work almost selfdeceived The diseases
 deemed dangerous sometimes come from the
3769 most hidden undefined and insidious beliefs
 The pallid invalid whom you declare to be wasting away
 with consumption of the blood should be told that blood
37612 never gave life and can never take it away  that Life is
 Spirit and that there is more life and immortality in one
 good motive and act than in all the blood which ever
37615 flowed through mortal veins and simulated a corporeal
 sense of life

 Remedy for fever

 If the body is material it cannot for that very reason
37618 suffer with a fever Because the socalled material body
 is a mental concept and governed by mortal
 mind it manifests only what that socalled
37621 mind expresses Therefore the efficient remedy is to
 destroy the patients false belief by both silently and au
 dibly arguing the true facts in regard to harmonious
37624 being  representing man as healthy instead of diseased
 and showing that it is impossible for matter to suffer to
 feel pain or heat to be thirsty or sick Destroy fear
37627 and you end fever Some people mistaught as to Mind
 science inquire when it will be safe to check a fever
 Know that in Science you cannot check a fever after ad
37630 mitting that it must have its course To fear and admit
 the power of disease is to paralyze mental and scientific
 demonstration

3771 If your patient believes in taking cold mentally con
 vince him that matter cannot take cold and that thought
3773 governs this liability If grief causes suffering convince
 the sufferer that affliction is often the source of joy and
 that he should rejoice always in everpresent Love

 Climate harmless

3776 Invalids flee to tropical climates in order to save their
 lives but they come back no better than when they went
 away Then is the time to cure them through
3779 Christian Science and prove that they can
 be healthy in all climates when their fear of climate is
 exterminated

 Mind governs body

37712 Through different states of mind the body becomes
 suddenly weak or abnormally strong showing mortal
 mind to be the producer of strength or weak
37715 ness A sudden joy or grief has caused what
 is termed instantaneous death Because a belief origi
 nates unseen the mental state should be continually
37718 watched that it may not produce blindly its bad effects
 The author never knew a patient who did not recover
 when the belief of the disease had gone Remove the
37721 leading error or governing fear of this lower socalled mind
 and you remove the cause of all disease as well as the mor
 bid or excited action of any organ You also remove in
37724 this way what are termed organic diseases as readily as
 functional difficulties

 The cause of all socalled disease is mental a mortal
37727 fear a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and
 power of illhealth also a fear that Mind is helpless to
 defend the life of man and incompetent to control it With
37730 out this ignorant human belief any circumstance is of it
 self powerless to produce suffering It is latent belief in
 disease as well as the fear of disease which associates sick
3781 ness with certain circumstances and causes the two to
 appear conjoined even as poetry and music are repro
3783 duced in union by human memory Disease has no in
 telligence Unwittingly you sentence yourself to suffer
 The understanding of this will enable you to commute this
3786 selfsentence and meet every circumstance with truth
 Disease is less than mind and Mind can control it

 Latent power

 Without the socalled human mind there can be no
3789 inflammatory nor torpid action of the system Remove
 the error and you destroy its effects By
 looking a tiger fearlessly in the eye Sir Charles
37812 Napier sent it cowering back into the jungle An ani
 mal may infuriate another by looking it in the eye and
 both will fight for nothing A mans gaze fastened
37815 fearlessly on a ferocious beast often causes the beast to
 retreat in terror This latter occurrence represents the
 power of Truth over error  the might of intelligence
37818 exercised over mortal beliefs to destroy them whereas
 hypnotism and hygienic drilling and drugging adopted
 to cure matter is represented by two material erroneous
37821 bases

 Disease powerless

 Disease is not an intelligence to dispute the empire of
 Mind or to dethrone Mind and take the government into
37824 its own hands Sickness is not a Godgiven
 nor a selfconstituted material power which
 copes astutely with Mind and finally conquers it God
37827 never endowed matter with power to disable Life or to
 chill harmony with a long and cold night of discord
 Such a power without the divine permission is incon
37830 ceivable and if such a power could be divinely directed
 it would manifest less wisdom than we usually find dis
 played in human governments

 Jurisdiction of Mind

3791 If disease can attack and control the body without
 the consent of mortals sin can do the same for both
3793 are errors announced as partners in the be
 ginning The Christian Scientist finds only
 effects where the ordinary physician looks for causes
3796 The real jurisdiction of the world is in Mind controlling
 every effect and recognizing all causation as vested in
 divine Mind

 Power of imagination

3799 A felon on whom certain English students experi
 mented fancied himself bleeding to death and died be
 cause of that belief when only a stream of
37912 warm water was trickling over his arm Had
 he known his sense of bleeding was an illusion he would
 have risen above the false belief Let the despairing in
37915 valid inspecting the hue of her blood on a cambric hand
 kerchief think of the experiment of those Oxford boys
 who caused the death of a man when not a drop of his
37918 blood was shed Then let her learn the opposite state
 ment of life as taught in Christian Science and she will
 understand that she is not dying on account of the state of
37921 her blood but is suffering from her belief that blood is
 destroying her life The socalled vital current does not
 affect the invalids health but her belief produces the
37924 very results she dreads

 Fevers the effect of fear

 Fevers are errors of various types The quickened
 pulse coated tongue febrile heat dry skin pain in the
37927 head and limbs are pictures drawn on the
 body by a mortal mind The images held in
 this disturbed mind frighten conscious thought Unless
37930 the feverpicture drawn by millions of mortals and im
 aged on the body through the belief that mind is in matter
 and discord is as real as harmony is destroyed through
3801 Science it may rest at length on some receptive thought
 and become a fever case which ends in a belief called
3803 death which belief must be finally conquered by eternal
 Life Truth is always the victor Sickness and sin fall
 by their own weight Truth is the rock of ages the head
3806 stone of the corner but on whomsoever it shall fall it
 will grind him to powder

 Misdirected contention

 Contending for the evidence or indulging the demands
3809 of sin disease or death we virtually contend against
 the control of Mind over body and deny the
 power of Mind to heal This false method
38012 is as though the defendant should argue for the plaintiff
 in favor of a decision which the defendant knows will
 be turned against himself

 Benefits of metaphysics

38015 The physical effects of fear illustrate its illusion Gaz
 ing at a chained lion crouched for a spring should not
 terrify a man The body is affected only with
38018 the belief of disease produced by a socalled
 mind ignorant of the truth which chains disease Noth
 ing but the power of Truth can prevent the fear of
38021 error and prove mans dominion over error

 A higher discovery

 Many years ago the author made a spiritual discov
 ery the scientific evidence of which has accumulated to
38024 prove that the divine Mind produces in man
 health harmony and immortality Gradu
 ally this evidence will gather momentum and clearness
38027 until it reaches its culmination of scientific statement and
 proof Nothing is more disheartening than to believe
 that there is a power opposite to God or good and that
38030 God endows this opposing power with strength to be used
 against Himself against Life health harmony

 Ignorance of our rights

 Every law of matter or the body supposed to govern
3811 man is rendered null and void by the law of Life God
 Ignorant of our Godgiven rights we submit to unjust
3813 decrees and the bias of education enforces
 this slavery Be no more willing to suffer the
 illusion that you are sick or that some disease is develop
3816 ing in the system than you are to yield to a sinful temp
 tation on the ground that sin has its necessities

 No laws of matter

 When infringing some supposed law you say that
3819 there is danger This fear is the danger and induces the
 physical effects We cannot in reality suffer
 from breaking anything except a moral or
38112 spiritual law The socalled laws of mortal belief are
 destroyed by the understanding that Soul is immortal
 and that mortal mind cannot legislate the times periods
38115 and types of disease with which mortals die God is the
 lawmaker but He is not the author of barbarous codes
 In infinite Life and Love there is no sickness sin nor
38118 death and the Scriptures declare that we live move and
 have our being in the infinite God

 Godgiven dominion

 Think less of the enactments of mortal mind and you
38121 will sooner grasp mans Godgiven dominion You must
 understand your way out of human theories
 relating to health or you will never believe
38124 that you are quite free from some ailment The har
 mony and immortality of man will never be reached
 without the understanding that Mind is not in matter
38127 Let us banish sickness as an outlaw and abide by the
 rule of perpetual harmony  Gods law It is mans
 moral right to annul an unjust sentence a sentence never
38130 inflicted by divine authority

 Begin rightly

 Christ Jesus overruled the error which would impose
 penalties for transgressions of the physical laws of
3821 health he annulled supposed laws of matter opposed
 to the harmonies of Spirit lacking divine au
3823 thority and having only human approval for
 their sanction

 Hygiene excessive

 If half the attention given to hygiene were given to the
3826 study of Christian Science and to the spiritualization of
 thought this alone would usher in the millen
 inium Constant bathing and rubbing to alter
3829 the secretions or to remove unhealthy exhalations from
 the cuticle receive a useful rebuke from Jesus precept
 Take no thought    for the body We must beware
38212 of making clean merely the outside of the platter

 Blissful ignorance

 He who is ignorant of what is termed hygienic law is
 more receptive of spiritual power and of faith in one
38215 God than is the devotee of supposed hygienic
 law who comes to teach the socalled igno
 rant one Must we not then consider the socalled law
38218 of matter a canon more honored in the breach than
 the observance A patient thoroughly booked in medi
 cal theories is more difficult to heal through Mind than
38221 one who is not This verifies the saying of our Master
 Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
 little child shall in no wise enter therein

38224 One whom I rescued from seeming spiritual oblivion
 in which the senses had engulfed him wrote to me I
 should have died but for the glorious Principle you teach
38227  supporting the power of Mind over the body and show
 ing me the nothingness of the socalled pleasures and pains
 of sense The treatises I had read and the medicines I
38230 had taken only abandoned me to more hopeless suffering
 and despair Adherence to hygiene was useless Mortal
 mind needed to be set right The ailment was not bodily
3831 but mental and I was cured when I learned my way in
 Christian Science

 A clean mind and body

3833 We need a clean body and a clean mind  a body
 rendered pure by Mind as well as washed by water
 One says I take good care of my body
3836 To do this the pure and exalting influence of
 the divine Mind on the body is requisite and the Christian
 Scientist takes the best care of his body when he leaves
3839 it most out of his thought and like the Apostle Paul is
 willing rather to be absent from the body and to be pres
 ent with the Lord

38312 A hint may be taken from the emigrant whose filth
 does not affect his happiness because mind and body
 rest on the same basis To the mind equally gross dirt
38315 gives no uneasiness It is the native element of such a
 mind which is symbolized and not chafed by its sur
 roundings but impurity and uncleanliness which do
38318 not trouble the gross could not be borne by the refined
 This shows that the mind must be clean to keep the body
 in proper condition

 Beliefs illusive

38321 The tobaccouser eating or smoking poison for half a
 century sometimes tells you that the weed preserves
 his health but does this make it so Does his
38324 assertion prove the use of tobacco to be a salu
 brious habit and man to be the better for it Such in
 stances only prove the illusive physical effect of a false
38327 belief confirming the Scriptural conclusion concerning a
 man As he thinketh in his heart so is he

 The movementcure  pinching and pounding the poor
38330 body to make it sensibly well when it ought to be in
 sensibly so  is another medical mistake resulting from
 the common notion that health depends on inert matter
3841 instead of on Mind Can matter or what is termed
 matter either feel or act without mind

 Corporeal penalties

3843 We should relieve our minds from the depressing thought
 that we have transgressed a material law and must of
 necessity pay the penalty Let us reassure
3846 ourselves with the law of Love God never
 punishes man for doing right for honest labor or for
 deeds of kindness though they expose him to fatigue
3849 cold heat contagion If man seems to incur the penalty
 through matter this is but a belief of mortal mind not
 an enactment of wisdom and man has only to enter his
38412 protest against this belief in order to annul it Through
 this action of thought and its results upon the body the
 student will prove to himself by small beginnings the
38415 grand verities of Christian Science

 Not matter but Mind

 If exposure to a draught of air while in a state of
 perspiration is followed by chills dry cough influenza
38418 congestive symptoms in the lungs or hints of
 inflammatory rheumatism your Mindremedy
 is safe and sure If you are a Christian Scientist such
38421 symptoms are not apt to follow exposure but if you
 believe in laws of matter and their fatal effects when
 transgressed you are not fit to conduct your own case or
38424 to destroy the bad effects of your belief When the fear
 subsides and the conviction abides that you have broken
 no law neither rheumatism consumption nor any other
38427 disease will ever result from exposure to the weather In
 Science this is an established fact which all the evidence
 before the senses can never overrule

 Benefit of philanthropy

38430 Sickness sin and death must at length quail before
 the divine rights of intelligence and then the power
 of Mind over the entire functions and organs of the
3851 human system will be acknowledged It is proverbial
 that Florence Nightingale and other philanthropists en
3853 gaged in humane labors have been able to
 undergo without sinking fatigues and expo
 sures which ordinary people could not endure The ex
3856 planation lies in the support which they derived from
 the divine law rising above the human The spiritual
 demand quelling the material supplies energy and en
3859 durance surpassing all other aids and forestalls the
 penalty which our beliefs would attach to our best
 deeds Let us remember that the eternal law of right
38512 though it can never annul the law which makes sin its
 own executioner exempts man from all penalties but
 those due for wrongdoing

 Honest toil has no penalty

38515 Constant toil deprivations exposures and all untow
 ard conditions if without sin can be experienced with
 out suffering Whatever it is your duty to do
38518 you can do without harm to yourself If you
 sprain the muscles or wound the flesh your
 remedy is at hand Mind decides whether or not the
38521 flesh shall be discolored painful swollen and inflamed

 Our sleep and food

 You say that you have not slept well or have overeaten
 You are a law unto yourself Saying this and believing
38524 it you will suffer in proportion to your belief
 and fear Your sufferings are not the penalty
 for having broken a law of matter for it is a law of mortal
38527 mind which you have disobeyed You say or think be
 cause you have partaken of salt fish that you must be
 thirsty and you are thirsty accordingly while the oppo
38530 site belief would produce the opposite result

 Doubtful evidence

 Any supposed information coming from the body or
 from inert matter as if either were intelligent is an illu
3861 sion of mortal mind  one of its dreams Realize that
 the evidence of the senses is not to be accepted
3863 in the case of sickness any more than it is in
 the case of sin

 Climate and belief

 Expose the body to certain temperatures and belief
3866 says that you may catch cold and have catarrh but no
 such result occurs without mind to demand
 it and produce it So long as mortals declare
3869 that certain states of the atmosphere produce catarrh
 fever rheumatism or consumption those effects will
 follow  not because of the climate but on account of
38612 the belief The author has in too many instances healed
 disease through the action of Truth on the minds of mor
 tals and the corresponding effects of Truth on the body
38615 not to know that this is so

 Erroneous despatch

 A blundering despatch mistakenly announcing the
 death of a friend occasions the same grief that the friends
38618 real death would bring You think that your
 anguish is occasioned by your loss Another
 despatch correcting the mistake heals your grief and
38621 you learn that your suffering was merely the result of
 your belief Thus it is with all sorrow sickness and
 death You will learn at length that there is no cause
38624 for grief and divine wisdom will then be understood
 Error not Truth produces all the suffering on earth

 Mourning causeless

 If a Christian Scientist had said while you were labor
38627 ing under the influence of the belief of grief Your sor
 row is without cause you would not have
 understood him although the correctness of
38630 the assertion might afterwards be proved to you So
 when our friends pass from our sight and we lament
 that lamentation is needless and causeless We shall
3871 perceive this to be true when we grow into the under
 standing of Life and know that there is no death

 Mind heals braindisease

3873 Because mortal mind is kept active must it pay the
 penalty in a softened brain Who dares to say that actual
 Mind can be overworked When we reach
3876 our limits of mental endurance we conclude
 that intellectual labor has been carried sufficiently far
 but when we realize that immortal Mind is ever active
3879 and that spiritual energies can neither wear out nor can
 socalled material law trespass upon Godgiven powers
 and resources we are able to rest in Truth refreshed by
38712 the assurances of immortality opposed to mortality

 Right never punishable

 Our thinkers do not die early because they faithfully
 perform the natural functions of being If printers and
38715 authors have the shortest span of earthly ex
 istence it is not because they occupy the most
 important posts and perform the most vital functions in
38718 society That man does not pay the severest penalty
 who does the most good By adhering to the realities of
 eternal existence  instead of reading disquisitions on
38721 the inconsistent supposition that death comes in obedience
 to the law of life and that God punishes man for doing
 good  one cannot suffer as the result of any labor of
38724 love but grows stronger because of it It is a law of so
 called mortal mind misnamed matter which causes all
 things discordant

 Christian history

38727 The history of Christianity furnishes sublime proofs
 of the supporting influence and protecting power bestowed
 on man by his heavenly Father omnipotent
38730 Mind who gives man faith and understanding
 whereby to defend himself not only from temptation but
 from bodily suffering

3881 The Christian martyrs were prophets of Christian
 Science Through the uplifting and consecrating power
3883 of divine Truth they obtained a victory over the corpo
 real senses a victory which Science alone can explain
 Stolidity which is a resisting state of mortal mind suffers
3886 less only because it knows less of material law

 The Apostle John testified to the divine basis of Chris
 tian Science when dire inflictions failed to destroy his
3889 body Idolaters believing in more than one mind had
 gods many and thought that they could kill the body
 with matter independently of mind

 Sustenance spiritual

38812 Admit the common hypothesis that food is the nutri
 ment of life and the follows the necessity for another
 admission in the opposite direction  that
38815 food has power to destroy Life God through
 a deficiency or an excess a quality or a quantity This
 is a specimen of the ambiguous nature of all material
38818 healththeories They are selfcontradictory and selfde
 structive constituting a kingdom divided against itself
 which is brought to desolation If food was prepared
38821 by Jesus for his disciples it cannot destroy life

 God sustains man

 The fact is food does not affect the absolute Life of
 man and this becomes selfevident when we learn that
38824 God is our Life Because sin and sickness are
 not qualities of Soul or Life we have hope in
 immortality but it would be foolish to venture beyond
38827 our present understanding foolish to stop eating until
 we gain perfection and a clear comprehension of the living
 Spirit In that perfect day of understanding we shall
38830 neither eat to live nor live to eat

 Diet and digestion

 If mortals think that food disturbs the harmonious
 functions of mind and body either the food or this thought
3891 must be dispensed with for the penalty is coupled with
 the belief Which shall it be If this decision be left
3893 to Christian Science it will be given in behalf
 of the control of Mind over this belief and every
 erroneous belief or material condition The less we
3896 know or think about hygiene the less we are predisposed
 to sickness Recollect that it is not the nerves not mat
 ter but mortal mind which reports food as undigested
3899 Matter does not inform you of bodily derangements it
 is supposed to do so This pseudomental testimony can
 be destroyed only by the better results of Minds oppo
38912 site evidence

 Scripture rebukes

 Our dietetic theories first admit that food sustains the
 life of man and then discuss the certainty that food can
38915 kill man This false reasoning is rebuked in
 Scripture by the metaphors about the fount
 and stream the tree and its fruit and the kingdom di
38918 vided against itself If God has as prevalent theories
 maintain instituted laws that food shall support human
 life He cannot annul these regulations by an opposite
38921 law that food shall be inimical to existence

 Ancient confusion

 Materialists contradict their own statements Their
 belief in material laws and in penalties for their infrac
38924 tion is the ancient error that there is fraternity
 between pain and pleasure good and evil God
 and Satan This belief totters to its falling before the
38927 battleaxe of Science

 A case of convulsions produced by indigestion came
 under my observation In her belief the woman had
38930 chronic livercomplaint and was then suffering from a
 complication of symptoms connected with this belief I
 cured her in a few minutes One instant she spoke de
3901 spairingly of herself The next minute she said My
 food is all digested and I should like something more
3903 to eat

 Ultimate harmony

 We cannot deny that Life is selfsustained and we
 should never deny the everlasting harmony of Soul sim
3906 ply because to the mortal senses there is seem
 ing discord It is our ignorance of God the
 divine Principle which produces apparent discord and
3909 the right understanding of Him restores harmony Truth
 will at length compel us all to exchange the pleasures and
 pains of sense for the joys of Soul

 Unnecessary prostration

39012 When the first symptoms of disease appear dispute the
 testimony of the material senses with divine Science Let
 your higher sense of justice destroy the false
39015 process of mortal opinions which you name
 law and then you will not be confined to a sickroom nor
 laid upon a bed of suffering in payment of the last far
39018 thing the last penalty demanded by error Agree with
 thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with
 him Suffer no claim of sin or of sickness to grow upon
39021 the thought Dismiss it with an abiding conviction that
 it is illegitimate because you know that God is no more
 the author of sickness than He is of sin You have no
39024 law of His to support the necessity either of sin or sick
 ness but you have divine authority for denying that neces
 sity and healing the sick

 Treatment of disease

39027 Agree to disagree with approaching symptoms of
 chronic or acute disease whether it is cancer consump
 tion or smallpox Meet the incipient stages
39030 of disease with as powerful mental opposi
 tion as a legislator would employ to defeat the passage of
 an inhuman law Rise in the conscious strength of the
3911 spirit of Truth to overthrow the plea of mortal mind
 alias matter arrayed against the supremacy of Spirit
3913 Blot out the images of mortal thought and its beliefs in
 sickness and sin Then when thou art delivered to the
 judgment of Truth Christ the judge will say Thou
3916 art whole

 Righteous rebellion

 Instead of blind and calm submission to the incipient
 or advanced stages of disease rise in rebellion against
3919 them Banish the belief that you can possi
 bly entertain a single intruding pain which can
 not be ruled out by the might of Mind and in this way
39112 you can prevent the development of pain in the body
 No law of God hinders this result It is error to suffer
 for aught but your own sins Christ or Truth will de
39115 stroy all other supposed suffering and real suffering for
 your own sins will cease in proportion as the sin ceases

 Contradict error

 Justice is the moral signification of law Injustice de
39118 clares the absence of law When the body is supposed
 to say I am sick never plead guilty Since
 matter cannot talk it must be mortal mind
39121 which speaks therefore meet the intimation with a pro
 test If you say I am sick you plead guilty Then
 your adversary will deliver you to the judge mortal
39124 mind and the judge will sentence you Disease has
 no intelligence to declare itself something and announce
 its name Mortal mind alone sentences itself Therefore
39127 make your own terms with sickness and be just to yourself
 and to others

 Sin to be overcome

 Mentally contradict every complaint from the body
39130 and rise to the true consciousness of Life as
 Love  as all that is pure and bearing the
 fruits of Spirit Fear is the fountain of sickness
3921 and you master fear and sin through divine Mind hence
 it is through divine Mind that you overcome disease
3923 Only while fear or sin remains can it bring forth death
 To cure a bodily ailment every broken moral law should
 be taken into account and the error be rebuked Fear
3926 which is an element of all disease must be cast out to
 readjust the balance for God Casting out evil and fear
 enables truth to outweigh error The only course is to
3929 take antagonistic grounds against all that is opposed to
 the health holiness and harmony of man Gods image

 Illusions about nerves

 The physical affirmation of disease should always be
39212 met with the mental negation Whatever benefit is pro
 duced on the body must be expressed men
 tally and thought should be held fast to this
39215 ideal If you believe in inflamed and weak nerves you
 are liable to an attack from that source You will call it
 neuralgia but we call it a belief If you think that con
39218 sumption is hereditary in your family you are liable to
 the development of that thought in the form of what is
 termed pulmonary disease unless Science shows you
39221 otherwise If you decide that climate or atmosphere is
 unhealthy it will be so to you Your decisions will mas
 ter you whichever direction they take

 Guarding the door

39224 Reverse the case Stand porter at the door of thought
 Admitting only such conclusions as you wish realized in
 bodily results you will control yourself har
39227 moniously When the condition is present
 which you say induces disease whether it be air exercise
 heredity contagion or accident then perform your office
39230 as porter and shut out these unhealthy thoughts and fears
 Exclude from mortal mind the offending errors then the
 body cannot suffer from them The issues of pain or
3931 pleasure must come through mind and like a watchman
 forsaking his post we admit the intruding belief forget
3933 ting that through divine help we can forbid this entrance

 The strength of Spirit

 The body seems to be selfacting only because mortal
 mind is ignorant of itself of its own actions and of their
3936 results  ignorant that the predisposing re
 mote and exciting cause of all bad effects is a
 law of socalled mortal mind not of matter Mind is the
3939 master of the corporeal senses and can conquer sickness
 sin and death Exercise this Godgiven authority Take
 possession of your body and govern its feeling and action
39312 Rise in the strength of Spirit to resist all that is unlike
 good God has made man capable of this and nothing
 can vitiate the ability and power divinely bestowed on
39315 man

 No pain in matter

 Be firm in your understanding that the divine Mind
 governs and that in Science man reflects Gods govern
39318 ment Have no fear that matter can ache
 swell and be inflamed as the result of a law
 of any kind when it is selfevident that matter can have
39321 no pain nor inflammation Your body would suffer no
 more from tension or wounds than the trunk of a tree
 which you gash or the electric wire which you stretch
39324 were it not for mortal mind

 When Jesus declares that the light of the body is the
 eye he certainly means that light depends upon Mind
39327 not upon the complex humors lenses muscles the iris
 and pupil constituting the visual organism

 No real disease

 Man is never sick for Mind is not sick and matter
39330 cannot be A false belief is both the tempter
 and the tempted the sin and the sinner the
 disease and its cause It is well to be calm in sickness
3941 to be hopeful is still better but to understand that sick
 ness is not real and that Truth can destroy its seeming
3943 reality is best of all for this understanding is the uni
 versal and perfect remedy

 Recuperation mental

 By conceding power to discord a large majority of
3946 doctors depress mental energy which is the only real
 recuperative power Knowledge that we
 can accomplish the good we hope for stimu
3949 lates the system to act in the direction which Mind points
 out The admission that any bodily condition is beyond
 the control of Mind disarms man prevents him from
39412 helping himself and enthrones matter through error To
 those struggling with sickness such admissions are dis
 couraging  as much so as would be the advice to a man
39415 who is down in the world that he should not try to rise
 above his difficulties

 Experience has proved to the author the fallacy of
39418 material systems in general  that their theories are
 sometimes pernicious and that their denials are better
 than their affirmations Will you bid a man let evils
39421 overcome him assuring him that all misfortunes are from
 God against whom mortals should not contend Will
 you tell the sick that their condition is hopeless unless it
39424 can be aided by a drug or climate Are material means
 the only refuge from fatal chances Is there no divine
 permission to conquer discord of every kind with harmony
39427 with Truth and Love

 Arguing wrongly

 We should remember that Life is God and that God
 is omnipotent Not understanding Christian
39430 Science the sick usually have little faith in
 it till they feel its beneficent influence This shows
 that faith is not the healer in such cases The sick
3951 unconsciously argue for suffering instead of against it
 They admit its reality whereas they should deny it
3953 They should plead in opposition to the testimony of the
 deceitful senses and maintain mans immortality and
 eternal likeness to God

 Divine authority

3956 Like the great Exemplar the healer should speak to
 disease as one having authority over it leaving Soul to
 master the false evidences of the corporeal
3959 senses and to assert its claims over mortal
 ity and disease The same Principle cures both sin and
 sickness When divine Science overcomes faith in a car
39512 nal mind and faith in God destroys all faith in sin and in
 material methods of healing then sin disease and death
 will disappear

 Aids in sickness

39515 Prayers in which God is not asked to heal but is be
 sought to take the patient to Himself do not benefit the
 sick An illtempered complaining or deceit
39518 ful person should not be a nurse The nurse
 should be cheerful orderly punctual patient full of
 faith  receptive to Truth and Love

 Mental quackery

39521 It is mental quackery to make disease a reality  to
 hold it as something seen and felt  and then to attempt
 its cure through Mind It is no less erroneous
39524 to believe in the real existence of a tumor a
 cancer or decayed lungs while you argue against their
 reality than it is for your patient to feel these ills in
39527 physical belief Mental practice which holds disease
 as a reality fastens disease on the patient and it may
 appear in a more alarming form

 Effacing images of disease

39530 The knowledge that brainlobes cannot kill a man nor
 affect the functions of mind would prevent the brain from
 becoming diseased though a moral offence is indeed the
3961 worst of diseases One should never hold in mind
 the thought of disease but should efface from
3963 thought all forms and types of disease both for
 ones own sake and for that of the patient

 Avoid talking disease

 Avoid talking illness to the patient Make no unne
3966 cessary inquiries relative to feelings or disease Never
 startle with a discouraging remark about re
 covery nor draw attention to certain symp
3969 toms as unfavorable avoid speaking aloud the name of
 the disease Never say beforehand how much you have
 to contend with in a case nor encourage in the patients
39612 thought the expectation of growing worse before a crisis
 is passed

 False testimony refuted

 The refutation of the testimony of material sense is
39615 not a difficult task in view of the conceded falsity of this
 testimony The refutation becomes arduous
 not because the testimony of sin or disease is
39618 true but solely on account of the tenacity of belief in its
 truth due to the force of education and the overwhelm
 ing weight of opinions on the wrong side  all teaching
39621 that the body suffers as if matter could have sensation

 Healthful explanation

 At the right time explain to the sick the power which
 their beliefs exercise over their bodies Give them divine
39624 and wholesome understanding with which to
 combat their erroneous sense and so efface the
 images of sickness from mortal mind Keep distinctly in
39627 thought that man is the offspring of God not of man
 that man is spiritual not material that Soul is Spirit
 outside of matter never in it never giving the body life
39630 and sensation It breaks the dream of disease to under
 stand that sickness is formed by the human mind not by
 matter nor by the divine Mind

 Misleading methods

3971 By not perceiving vital metaphysical points not seeing
 how mortal mind affects the body  acting beneficially
3973 or injuriously on the health as well as on the
 morals and the happiness of mortals  we are
 misled in our conclusions and methods We throw the
3976 mental influence on the wrong side thereby actually in
 juring those whom we mean to bless

 Remedy for accidents

 Suffering is no less a mental condition than is enjoy
3979 ment You cause bodily sufferings and increase them
 by admitting their reality and continuance
 as directly as you enhance your joys by be
39712 lieving them to be real and continuous When an ac
 cident happens you think or exclaim I am hurt
 Your thought is more powerful than your words more
39715 powerful than the accident itself to make the injury
 real

 Now reverse the process Declare that you are not hurt
39718 and understand the reason why and you will find the
 ensuing good effects to be in exact proportion to your
 disbelief in physics and your fidelity to divine meta
39721 physics confidence in God as All which the Scriptures
 declare Him to be

 Independent mentality

 To heal the sick one must be familiar with the great
39724 verities of being Mortals are no more material in their
 waking hours than when they act walk see
 hear enjoy or suffer in dreams We can
39727 never treat mortal mind and matter separately because
 they combine as one Give up the belief that mind
 is even temporarily compressed within the skull and
39730 you will quickly become more manly or womanly You
 will understand yourself and your Maker better than
 before

 Naming maladies

3981 Sometimes Jesus called a disease by name as when he
 said to the epileptic boy Thou dumb and deaf spirit I
3983 charge thee come out of him and enter no
 more into him It is added that the spirit
 error cried and rent him sore and came out of him and
3986 he was as one dead  clear evidence that the malady
 was not material These instances show the concessions
 which Jesus was willing to make to the popular ignorance
3989 of spiritual Lifelaws Often he gave no name to the
 distemper he cured To the synagogue rulers daughter
 whom they called dead but of whom he said she is not
39812 dead but sleepeth he simply said Damsel I say unto
 thee arise To the sufferer with the withered hand
 he said Stretch forth thine hand and it was restored
39815 whole like as the other

 The action of faith

 Homoeopathic remedies sometimes not containing a
 particle of medicine are known to relieve the symptoms
39818 of disease What produces the change It is
 the faith of the doctor and the patient which
 reduces selfinflicted sufferings and produces a new effect
39821 upon the body In like manner destroy the illusion of
 pleasure in intoxication and the desire for strong drink
 is gone Appetite and disease reside in mortal mind not
39824 in matter

 So also faith cooperating with a belief in the healing
 effects of time and medication will soothe fear and change
39827 the belief of disease to a belief of health Even a blind
 faith removes bodily ailments for a season but hypnotism
 changes such ills into new and more difficult forms of dis
39830 ease The Science of Mind must come to the rescue
 to work a radical cure Then we understand the process
 The great fact remains that evil is not mind Evil has
3991 no power no intelligence for God is good and therefore
 good is infinite is All

 Corporeal combinations

3993 You say that certain material combinations produce
 disease but if the material body causes disease can
 matter cure what matter has caused Mortal
3996 mind prescribes the drug and administers it
 Mortal mind plans the exercise and puts the body through
 certain motions No gastric gas accumulates not a se
3999 cretion nor combination can operate apart from the
 action of mortal thought alias mortal mind

 Automatic mechanism

 Socalled mortal mind sends its despatches over its
39912 body but this socalled mind is both the service and
 message of this telegraphy Nerves are un
 able to talk and matter can return no an
39915 swer to immortal Mind If Mind is the only actor how
 can mechanism be automatic Mortal mind perpetuates
 its own thought It constructs a machine manages it
39918 and then calls it material A mill at work or the action
 of a waterwheel is but a derivative from and continua
 tion of the primitive mortal mind Without this force
39921 the body is devoid of action and this deadness shows
 that socalled mortal life is mortal mind not matter

 Mental strength

 Scientifically speaking there is no mortal mind out of
39924 which to make material beliefs springing from illusion
 This misnamed mind is not an entity It is
 only a false sense of matter since matter is not
39927 sensible The one Mind God contains no mortal opin
 ions All that is real is included in this immortal Mind

 Confirmation in a parable

 Our Master asked How can one enter into a strong
39930 mans house and spoil his goods except he first
 bind the strong man In other words How
 can I heal the body without beginning with socalled
4001 mortal mind which directly controls the body When
 disease is once destroyed in this socalled mind the fear
4003 of disease is gone and therefore the disease is thor
 oughly cured Mortal mind is the strong man which
 must be held in subjection before its influence upon health
4006 and morals can be removed This error conquered we
 can despoil the strong man of his goods  namely of
 sin and disease

 Eradicate error from thought

4009 Mortals obtain the harmony of health only as they
 forsake discord acknowledge the supremacy of divine
 Mind and abandon their material beliefs
40012 Eradicate the image of disease from the per
 turbed thought before it has taken tangible
 shape in conscious thought alias the body and you pre
40015 vent the development of disease This task becomes easy
 if you understand that every disease is an error and has
 no character nor type except what mortal mind assigns to
40018 it By lifting thought above error or disease and con
 tending persistently for truth you destroy error

 Mortal mind controlled

 When we remove disease by addressing the disturbed
40021 mind giving no heed to the body we prove that thought
 alone creates the suffering Mortal mind
 rules all that is mortal We see in the body
40024 the images of this mind even as in optics we see painted
 on the retina the image which becomes visible to the
 senses The action of socalled mortal mind must be
40027 destroyed by the divine Mind to bring out the harmony
 of being Without divine control there is discord mani
 fest as sin sickness and death

 Mortal mind not a healer

40030 The Scriptures plainly declare the baneful influence of
 sinful thought on the body Even our Master felt this
 It is recorded that in certain localities he did not many
4011 mighty works because of their unbelief in Truth Any
 human error is its own enemy and works against itself
4013 it does nothing in the right direction and much
 in the wrong If socalled mind is cherishing
 evil passions and malicious purposes it is not a healer
4016 but it engenders disease and death

 Effect of opposites

 If faith in the truth of being which you impart men
 tally while destroying error causes chemicalization as
4019 when an alkali is destroying an acid it is be
 cause the truth of being must transform the
 error to the end of producing a higher manifestation
40112 This fermentation should not aggravate the disease but
 should be as painless to man as to a fluid since matter
 has no sensation and mortal mind only feels and sees
40115 materially

 What I term chemicalization is the upheaval produced
 when immortal Truth is destroying erroneous mortal be
40118 lief Mental chemicalization brings sin and sickness to
 the surface forcing impurities to pass away as is the case
 with a fermenting fluid

 Medicine and brain

40121 The only effect produced by medicine is dependent upon
 mental action If the mind were parted from the body
 could you produce any effect upon the brain
40124 or body by applying the drug to either Would
 the drug remove paralysis affect organization or restore
 will and action to cerebrum and cerebellum

 Skilful surgery

40127 Until the advancing age admits the efficacy and suprem
 acy of Mind it is better for Christian Scientists to leave
 surgery and the adjustment of broken bones
40130 and dislocations to the fingers of a surgeon
 while the mental healer confines himself chiefly to mental
 reconstruction and to the prevention of inflammation
4021 Christian Science is always the most skilful surgeon but
 surgery is the branch of its healing which will be last
4023 acknowledged However it is but just to say that the
 author has already in her possession wellauthenticated
 records of the cure by herself and her students through
4026 mental surgery alone of broken bones dislocated joints
 and spinal vertebrae

 Indestructible life of man

 The time approaches when mortal mind will forsake
4029 its corporeal structural and material basis when im
 mortal Mind and its formations will be appre
 hended in Science and material beliefs will
40212 not interfere with spiritual facts Man is indestructible
 and eternal Sometime it will be learned that mortal
 mind constructs the mortal body with this minds own
40215 mortal materials In Science no breakage nor dislocation
 can really occur You say that accidents injuries and
 disease kill man but this is not true The life of man is
40218 Mind The material body manifests only what mortal
 mind believes whether it be a broken bone disease or sin

 The evil of mesmerism

 We say that one human mind can influence another and
40221 in this way affect the body but we rarely remember that
 we govern our own bodies The error mes
 merism  or hypnotism to use the recent term
40224  illustrates the fact just stated The operator would
 make his subjects believe that they cannot act voluntarily
 and handle themselves as they should do If they yield
40227 to this influence it is because their belief is not better
 instructed by spiritual understanding Hence the proof
 that hypnotism is not scientific Science cannot produce
40230 both disorder and order The involuntary pleasure or
 pain of the person under hypnotic control is proved to be
 a belief without a real cause

 Wrongdoer should suffer

4031 So the sick through their beliefs have induced their own
 diseased conditions The great difference between vol
4033 untary and involuntary mesmerism is that vol
 untary mesmerism is induced consciously and
 should and does cause the perpetrator to suffer while self
4036 mesmerism is induced unconsciously and by his mistake
 a man is often instructed In the first instance it is under
 stood that the difficulty is a mental illusion while in the
4039 second it is believed that the misfortune is a material effect
 The human mind is employed to remove the illusion in
 one case but matter is appealed to in the other In real
40312 ity both have their origin in the human mind and can be
 healed only by the divine Mind

 Errors power imaginary

 You command the situation if you understand that
40315 mortal existence is a state of selfdeception and not the
 truth of being Mortal mind is constantly
 producing on mortal body the results of false
40318 opinions and it will continue to do so until mortal
 error is deprived of its imaginary powers by Truth
 which sweeps away the gossamer web of mortal illusion
40321 The most Christian state is one of rectitude and spir
 itual understanding and this is best adapted for heal
 ing the sick Never conjure up some new discovery from
40324 dark forebodings regarding disease and then acquaint
 your patient with it

 Diseaseproduction

 The mortal socalled mind produces all that is unlike
40327 the immortal Mind The human mind determines the
 nature of a case and the practitioner improves
 or injures the case in proportion to the truth
40330 or error which influences his conclusions The mental
 conception and development of disease are not under
 stood by the patient but the physician should be familiar
4041 with mental action and its effect in order to judge the case
 according to Christian Science

 Appetites to be abandoned

4043 If a man is an inebriate a slave to tobacco or the special
 servant of any one of the myriad forms of sin meet and
 destroy these errors with the truth of being 
4046 by exhibiting to the wrongdoer the suffering
 which his submission to such habits brings and by con
 vincing him that there is no real pleasure in false appe
4049 tites A corrupt mind is manifested in a corrupt body
 Lust malice and all sorts of evil are diseased beliefs and
 you can destroy them only by destroying the wicked
40412 motives which produce them If the evil is over in the
 repentant mortal mind while its effects still remain on the
 individual you can remove this disorder as Gods law is
40415 fulfilled and reformation cancels the crime The healthy
 sinner is the hardened sinner

 Temperance reform

 The temperance reform felt all over our land results
40418 from metaphysical healing which cuts down every tree
 that brings not forth good fruit This con
 viction that there is no real pleasure in sin
40421 is one of the most important points in the theology of
 Christian Science Arouse the sinner to this new and
 true view of sin show him that sin confers no pleasure
40424 and this knowledge strengthens his moral courage and
 increases his ability to master evil and to love good

 Sin or fear the root of sickness

 Healing the sick and reforming the sinner are one and
40427 the same thing in Christian Science Both cures require
 the same method and are inseparable in Truth
 Hatred envy dishonesty fear and so forth
40430 make a man sick and neither material medi
 cine nor Mind can help him permanently even in body
 unless it makes him better mentally and so delivers him
4051 from his destroyers The basic error is mortal mind
 Hatred inflames the brutal propensities The indulgence
4053 of evil motives and aims makes any man who is above the
 lowest type of manhood a hopeless sufferer

 Mental conspirators

 Christian Science commands man to master the pro
4056 pensities  to hold hatred in abeyance with kindness
 to conquer lust with chastity revenge with
 charity and to overcome deceit with hon
4059 esty Choke these errors in their early stages if you
 would not cherish an army of conspirators against
 health happiness and success They will deliver you
40512 to the judge the arbiter of truth against error The
 judge will deliver you to justice and the sentence of
 the moral law will be executed upon mortal mind and
40515 body Both will be manacled until the last farthing
 is paid  until you have balanced your account with
 God Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also
40518 reap The good man finally can overcome his fear of
 sin This is sins necessity  to destroy itself Im
 mortal man demonstrates the government of God good
40521 in which is no power to sin

 Cumulative repentence

 It were better to be exposed to every plague on earth
 than to endure the cumulative effects of a guilty con
40524 science The abiding consciousness of wrong
 doing tends to destroy the ability to do right
 If sin is not regretted and is not lessening then it is
40527 hastening on to physical and moral doom You are con
 quered by the moral penalties you incur and the ills they
 bring The pains of sinful sense are less harmful than its
40530 pleasures Belief in material suffering causes mortals to
 retreat from their error to flee from body to Spirit and
 to appeal to divine sources outside of themselves

 The leaves of healing

4061 The Bible contains the recipe for all healing The
 leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations
4063 Sin and sickness are both healed by the same
 Principle The tree is typical of mans divine
 Principle which is equal to every emergency offering
4066 full salvation from sin sickness and death Sin will
 submit to Christian Science when in place of modes and
 forms the power of God is understood and demonstrated
4069 in the healing of mortals both mind and body Per
 fect Love casteth out fear

 Sickness will abate

 The Science of being unveils the errors of sense and
40612 spiritual perception aided by Science reaches Truth
 Then error disappears Sin and sickness will
 abate and seem less real as we approach the
40615 scientific period in which mortal sense is subdued and
 all that is unlike the true likeness disappears The moral
 man has no fear that he will commit a murder and he
40618 should be as fearless on the question of disease

 Resist to the end

 Resist evil  error of every sort  and it will flee from
 you Error is opposed to Life We can and ultimately
40621 shall so rise as to avail ourselves in every direc
 tion of the supremacy of Truth over error Life
 over death and good over evil and this growth will go
40624 on until we arrive at the fulness of Gods idea and no
 more fear that we shall be sick and die Inharmony of
 any kind involves weakness and suffering  a loss of
40627 control over the body

 Morbid cravings

 The depraved appetite for alcoholic drinks tobacco
 tea coffee opium is destroyed only by Minds mastery
40630 of the body This normal control is gained
 through divine strength and understanding
 There is no enjoyment in getting drunk in becoming a
4071 fool or an object of loathing but there is a very sharp
 remembrance of it a suffering inconceivably terrible to
4073 mans selfrespect Puffing the obnoxious fumes of to
 bacco or chewing a leaf naturally attractive to no crea
 ture except a loathsome worm is at least disgusting

 Universal panacea

4076 Mans enslavement to the most relentless masters 
 passion selfishness envy hatred and revenge  is con
 quered only by a mighty struggle Every
4079 hour of delay makes the struggle more severe
 If man is not victorious over the passions they crush
 out happiness health and manhood Here Christian
40712 Science is the sovereign panacea giving strength to the
 weakness of mortal mind  strength from the immortal
 and omnipotent Mind  and lifting humanity above
40715 itself into purer desires even into spiritual power and
 goodwill to man

 Let the slave of wrong desire learn the lessons of Chris
40718 tian Science and he will get the better of that desire
 and ascend a degree in the scale of health happiness
 and existence

 Immortal memory

40721 If delusion says I have lost my memory contra
 dict it No faculty of Mind is lost In Science all
 being is eternal spiritual perfect harmoni
40724 ous in every action Let the perfect model be
 present in your thoughts instead of its demoralized op
 posite This spiritualization of thought lets in the light
40727 and brings the divine Mind Life not death into your
 consciousness

 Sin a form of insanity

 There are many species of insanity All sin is insan
40730 ity in different degrees Sin is spared from
 this classification only because its method of
 madness is in consonance with common mortal belief
4081 Every sort of sickness is error  that is sickness is
 loss of harmony This view is not altered by the fact
4083 that sin is worse than sickness and sickness is not ac
 knowledged nor discovered to be error by many who are
 sick

4086 There is a universal insanity of socalled health which
 mistakes fable for fact throughout the entire round of the
 material senses but this general craze cannot in a scien
4089 tific diagnosis shield the individual case from the special
 name of insanity Those unfortunate people who are
 committed to insane asylums are only so many distinctly
40812 defined instances of the baneful effects of illusion on mor
 tal minds and bodies

 Drugs and brainlobes

 The supposition that we can correct insanity by the use
40815 of purgatives and narcotics is in itself a mild species of
 insanity Can drugs go of their own accord
 to the brain and destroy the socalled inflam
40818 mation of disordered functions thus reaching mortal
 mind through matter Drugs do not affect a corpse and
 Truth does not distribute drugs through the blood and
40821 from them derive a supposed effect on intelligence and sen
 timent A dislocation of the tarsal joint would produce
 insanity as perceptibly as would congestion of the brain
40824 were it not that mortal mind thinks that the tarsal joint is
 less intimately connected with the mind than is the brain
 Reverse the belief and the results would be perceptibly
40827 different

 Matter and animate error

 The unconscious thought in the corporeal substra
 tum of brain produces no effect and that condition of
40830 the body which we call sensation in matter
 is unreal Mortal mind is ignorant of it
 self  ignorant of the errors it includes and of their
4091 effects Intelligent matter is an impossibility You
 may say But if disease obtains in matter why do
4093 you insist that disease is formed by mortal mind and
 not by matter Mortal mind and body combine as
 one and the nearer matter approaches its final state
4096 ment  animate error called nerves brain mind  the
 more prolific it is likely to become in sin and disease
 beliefs

 Dictation of error

4099 Unconscious mortal mind  alias matter brain  can
 not dictate terms to consciousness nor say I am sick
 The belief that the unconscious substratum
40912 of mortal mind termed the body suffers and
 reports disease independently of this socalled conscious
 mind is the error which prevents mortals from knowing
40915 how to govern their bodies

 Socalled superiority

 The socalled conscious mortal mind is believed to be
 superior to its unconscious substratum matter and
40918 the stronger never yields to the weaker ex
 cept through fear or choice The animate
 should be governed by God alone The real man is
40921 spiritual and immortal but the mortal and imperfect
 socalled children of men are counterfeits from the
 beginning to be laid aside for the pure reality This
40924 mortal is put off and the new man or real man is put
 on in proportion as mortals realize the Science of man
 and seek the true model

 Death no benefactor

40927 We have no right to say that life depends on matter
 now but will not depend on it after death We cannot
 spend our days here in ignorance of the Science
40930 of Life and expect to find beyond the grave
 a reward for this ignorance Death will not make us
 harmonious and immortal as a recompense for ignorance
4101 If here we give no heed to Christian Science which is
 spiritual and eternal we shall not be ready for spiritual
4103 Life hereafter

 Life eternal and present

 This is life eternal says Jesus  is not shall be
 and then he defines everlasting life as a present knowledge
4106 of his Father and of himself  the knowledge
 of Love Truth and Life This is life eter
 nal that they might know Thee the only true God and
4109 Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent The Scriptures
 say Man shall not live by bread alone but by every
 word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God show
41012 ing that Truth is the actual life of man but mankind
 objects to making this teaching practical

 Love casteth out fear

 Every trial of our faith in God makes us stronger
41015 The more difficult seems the material condition to be
 overcome by Spirit the stronger should be our
 faith and the purer our love The Apostle
41018 John says There is no fear in Love but perfect Love
 casteth out fear    He that feareth is not made per
 fect in Love Here is a definite and inspired proclama
41021 tion of Christian Science

 MENTAL TREATMENT ILLUSTRATED

 Be not afraid

 The Science of mental practice is susceptible of no
41024 misuse Selfishness does not appear in the practice of
 Truth or Christian Science If mental prac
 tice is abused or is used in any way except to
41027 promote right thinking and doing the power to heal
 mentally will diminish until the practitioners healing
 ability is wholly lost Christian scientific practice be
41030 gins with Christs keynote of harmony Be not afraid
4111 Said Job The thing which I greatly feared is come
 upon me

 Naming diseases

4113 My first discovery in the students practice was this
 If the student silently called the disease by name when
 he argued against it as a general rule the body
4116 would respond more quickly  just as a per
 son replies more readily when his name is spoken but
 this was because the student was not perfectly attuned to
4119 divine Science and needed the arguments of truth for
 reminders If Spirit or the power of divine Love bear
 witness to the truth this is the ultimatum the scientific
41112 way and the healing is instantaneous

 Evils cast out

 It is recorded that once Jesus asked the name of a dis
 ease  a disease which moderns would call dementia
41115 The demon or evil replied that his name was
 Legion Thereupon Jesus cast out the evil
 and the insane man was changed and straightway be
41118 came whole The Scripture seems to import that Jesus
 caused the evil to be selfseen and so destroyed

 Fear as the foundation

 The procuring cause and foundation of all sickness is
41121 fear ignorance or sin Disease is always induced by a
 false sense mentally entertained not destroyed
 Disease is an image of thought externalized
41124 The mental state is called a material state Whatever
 is cherished in mortal mind as the physical condition is
 imaged forth on the body

 Unspoken pleading

41127 Always begin your treatment by allaying the fear
 of patients Silently reassure them as to their exemp
 tion from disease and danger Watch the re
41130 sult of this simple rule of Christian Science
 and you will find that it alleviates the symptoms of every
 disease If you succeed in wholly removing the fear
4121 your patient is healed The great fact that God lovingly
 governs all never punishing aught but sin is your stand
4123 point from which to advance and destroy the human fear
 of sickness Mentally and silently plead the case scien
 tifically for Truth You may vary the arguments to meet
4126 the peculiar or general symptoms of the case you treat
 but be thoroughly persuaded in your own mind concern
 ing the truth which you think or speak and you will be
4129 the victor

 Eloquent silence

 You may call the disease by name when you mentally
 deny it but by naming it audibly you are liable under
41212 some circumstances to impress it upon the
 thought The power of Christian Science and
 divine Love is omnipotent It is indeed adequate to un
41215 clasp the hold and to destroy disease sin and death

 Insistence requisite

 To prevent disease or to cure it the power of Truth
 of divine Spirit must break the dream of the material
41218 senses To heal by argument find the type
 of the ailment get its name and array your
 mental plea against the physical Argue at first men
41221 tally not audibly that the patient has no disease and
 conform the argument so as to destroy the evidence of
 disease Mentally insist that harmony is the fact and
41224 that sickness is a temporal dream Realize the presence
 of health and the fact of harmonious being until the
 body corresponds with the normal conditions of health
41227 and harmony

 The cure of infants

 If the case is that of a young child or an infant it needs
 to be met mainly through the parents thought silently
41230 or audibly on the aforesaid basis of Christian
 Science The Scientist knows that there can
 be no hereditary disease since matter is not intelligent
4131 and cannot transmit good or evil intelligence to man and
 God the only Mind does not produce pain in matter
4133 The act of yielding ones thoughts to the undue contem
 plation of physical wants or conditions induces those very
 conditions A single requirement beyond what is neces
4136 sary to meet the simplest needs of the babe is harmful
 Mind regulates the condition of the stomach bowels and
 food the temperature of children and of men and matter
4139 does not The wise or unwise views of parents and other
 persons on these subjects produce good or bad effects on
 the health of children

 Ablutions for cleanliness

41312 The daily ablutions of an infant are no more natural
 nor necessary than would be the process of taking a fish
 out of water every day and covering it with dirt
41315 in order to make it thrive more vigorously in its
 own element Cleanliness is next to godliness but
 washing should be only for the purpose of keeping the
41318 body clean and this can be effected without scrubbing the
 whole surface daily Water is not the natural habitat of
 humanity I insist on bodily cleanliness within and with
41321 out I am not patient with a speck of dirt but in caring
 for an infant one need not wash his little body all over each
 day in order to keep it sweet as the newblown flower

 Juvenile ailments

41324 Giving drugs to infants noticing every symptom of
 flatulency and constantly directing the mind to such
 signs  that mind being laden with illusions
41327 about disease healthlaws and death  these
 actions convey mental images to childrens budding
 thoughts and often stamp them there making it probable
41330 at any time that such ills may be reproduced in the very
 ailments feared A child may have worms if you say so
 or any other malady timorously held in the beliefs con
4141 cerning his body Thus are laid the foundations of the
 belief in disease and death and thus are children educated
4143 into discord

 Cure of insanity

 The treatment of insanity is especially interesting
 However obstinate the case it yields more readily than
4146 do most diseases to the salutary action of
 truth which counteracts error The argu
 ments to be used in curing insanity are the same as in
4149 other diseases namely the impossibility that matter
 brain can control or derange mind can suffer or cause
 suffering also the fact that truth and love will establish
41412 a healthy state guide and govern mortal mind or the
 thought of the patient and destroy all error whether it is
 called dementia hatred or any other discord

41415 To fix truth steadfastly in your patients thoughts ex
 plain Christian Science to them but not too soon  not
 until your patients are prepared for the explanation 
41418 lest you array the sick against their own interests by troub
 ling and perplexing their thought The Christian Scien
 tists argument rests on the Christianly scientific basis of
41421 being The Scripture declares The Lord He is God
 good there is none else beside Him Even so harmony
 is universal and discord is unreal Christian Science de
41424 clares that Mind is substance also that matter neither
 feels suffers nor enjoys Hold these points strongly in
 view Keep in mind the verity of being  that man is
41427 the image and likeness of God in whom all being is
 painless and permanent Remember that mans perfec
 tion is real and unimpeachable whereas imperfection is
41430 blameworthy unreal and is not brought about by divine
 Love

 Matter is not inflamed

 Matter cannot be inflamed Inflammation is fear an
4151 excited state of mortals which is not normal Immor
 tal Mind is the only cause therefore disease is neither a
4153 cause nor an effect Mind in every case is the
 eternal God good Sin disease and death
 have no foundations in Truth Inflamation as a mor
4156 tal belief quickens or impedes the action of the system
 because thought moves quickly or slowly leaps or halts
 when it contemplates unpleasant things or when the in
4159 dividual looks upon some object which he dreads In
 flammation never appears in a part which mortal thought
 does not reach That is why opiates relieve inflammation
41512 They quiet the thought by inducing stupefaction and by
 resorting to matter instead of to Mind Opiates do not
 remove the pain in any scientific sense They only ren
41515 der mortal mind temporarily less fearful till it can master
 an erroneous belief

 Truth calms the thought

 Note how thought makes the face pallid It either re
41518 tards the circulation or quickens it causing a pale or
 flushed cheek In the same way thought in
 creases or diminishes the secretions the action
41521 of the lungs of the bowels and of the heart The mus
 cles moving quickly or slowly and impelled or palsied by
 thought represent the action of all the organs of the hu
41524 man system including brain and viscera To remove
 the error producing disorder you must calm and instruct
 mortal mind with immortal Truth

 Effects of etherization

41527 Etherization will apparently cause the body to dis
 appear Before the thoughts are fully at rest the limbs
 will vanish from consciousness Indeed the
41530 whole frame will sink from sight along with
 surrounding objects leaving the pain standing forth as
 distinctly as a mountainpeak as if it were a separate
4161 bodily member At last the agony also vanishes This
 process shows the pain to be in the mind for the inflam
4163 mation is not suppressed and the belief of pain will
 presently return unless the mental image occasioning
 the pain be removed by recognizing the truth of being

 Sedatives valueless

4166 A hypodermic injection of morphine is administered
 to a patient and in twenty minutes the sufferer is qui
 etly asleep To him there is no longer any
4169 pain Yet any physician  allopathic homoe
 opathic botanic eclectic  will tell you that the trouble
 some material cause is unremoved and that when the
41612 soporific influence of the opium is exhausted the pa
 tient will find himself in the same pain unless the belief
 which occasions the pain has meanwhile been changed
41615 Where is the pain while the patient sleeps

 The socalled physical ego

 The material body which you call me is mortal mind
 and this mind is material in sensation even as the body
41618 which has originated from this material sense
 and been developed according to it is mate
 rial This materialism of parent and child is only in
41621 mortal mind as the dead body proves for when the
 mortal has resigned his body to dust the body is no
 longer the parent even in appearance

 Evil thought depletes

41624 The sick know nothing of the mental process by
 which they are depleted and next to nothing of the
 metaphysical method by which they can be
41627 healed If they ask about their disease tell
 them only what is best for them to know Assure them
 that they think too much about their ailments and
41630 have already heard too much on that subject Turn
 their thoughts away from their bodies to higher ob
 jects Teach them that their being is sustained by
4171 Spirit not by matter and that they find health peace
 and harmony in God divine Love

 Helpful encouragement

4173 Give sick people credit for sometimes knowing more
 than their doctors Always support their trust in the
 power of Mind to sustain the body Never
4176 tell the sick that they have more courage
 than strength Tell them rather that their strength
 is in proportion to their courage If you make the sick
4179 realize this great truism there will be no reaction from
 overexertion or from excited conditions Maintain
 the facts of Christian Science  that Spirit is God and
41712 therefore cannot be sick that what is termed matter
 cannot be sick that all causation is Mind acting
 through spiritual law Then hold your ground with
41715 the unshaken understanding of Truth and Love and
 you will win When you silence the witness against your
 plea you destroy the evidence for the disease disap
41718 pears The evidence before the corporeal senses is not
 the Science of immortal man

 Disease to be made unreal

 To the Christian Science healer sickness is a dream
41721 from which the patient needs to be awakened Dis
 ease should not appear real to the physician
 since it is demonstrable that the way to
41724 cure the patient is to make disease unreal to him To
 do this the physician must understand the unreality
 of disease in Science

41727 Explain audibly to your patients as soon as they can
 bear it the complete control which Mind holds over the
 body Show them how mortal mind seems to induce
41730 disease by certain fears and false conclusions and how
 divine Mind can cure by opposite thoughts Give your
 patients an underlying understanding to support them
4181 and to shield them from the baneful effects of their own
 conclusions Show them that the conquest over sickness
4183 as well as over sin depends on mentally destroying all
 belief in material pleasure or pain

 Christian pleading

 Stick to the truth of being in contradistinction to the
4186 error that life substance or intelligence can be in matter
 Plead with an honest conviction of truth and
 a clear perception of the unchanging unerr
4189 ing and certain effect of divine Science Then if your
 fidelity is half equal to the truth of your plea you will
 heal the sick

 Truthful arguments

41812 It must be clear to you that sickness is no more
 the reality of being than is sin This mortal dream
 of sickness sin and death should cease
41815 through Christian Science Then one dis
 ease would be as readily destroyed as another What
 ever the belief is if arguments are used to destroy it
41818 the belief must be repudiated and the negation must ex
 tend to the supposed disease and to whatever decides its
 type and symptoms Truth is affirmative and confers
41821 harmony All metaphysical logic is inspired by this sim
 ple rule of Truth which governs all reality By the
 truthful arguments you employ and especially by the
41824 spirit of Truth and Love which you entertain you will
 heal the sick

 Morality required

 Include moral as well as physical belief in your efforts
41827 to destroy error Cast out all manner of evil Preach
 the gospel to every creature Speak the
 truth to every form of error Tumors ulcers
41830 tubercles inflammation pain deformed joints are wak
 ing dreamshadows dark images of mortal thought which
 flee before the light of Truth

4191 A moral question may hinder the recovery of the sick
 Lurking error lust envy revenge malice or hate will
4193 perpetuate or even create the belief in disease Errors
 of all sorts tend in this direction Your true course is
 to destroy the foe and leave the field to God Life Truth
4196 and Love remembering that God and His ideas alone
 are real and harmonious

 Relapse unnecessary

 If your patient from any cause suffers a relapse meet
4199 the cause mentally and courageously knowing that
 there can be no reaction in Truth Neither
 disease itself sin nor fear has the power to
41912 cause disease or a relapse Disease has no intelligence
 with which to move itself about or to change itself from
 one form to another If disease moves mind not mat
41915 ter moves it therefore be sure that you move it off
 Meet every adverse circumstance as its master Ob
 serve mind instead of body lest aught unfit for develop
41918 ment enter thought Think less of material conditions
 and more of spiritual

 Conquer beliefs and fears

 Mind produces all action If the action proceeds from
41921 Truth from immortal Mind there is harmony but mor
 tal mind is liable to any phase of belief A
 relapse cannot in reality occur in mortals or
41924 socalled mortal minds for there is but one
 Mind one God Never fear the mental malpractitioner
 the mental assassin who in attempting to rule mankind
41927 tramples upon the divine Principle of metaphysics for God
 is the only power To succeed in healing you must con
 quer your own fears as well as those of your patients and
41930 rise into higher and holier consciousness

 True government of man

 If it is found necessary to treat against relapse know
 that disease or its symptoms cannot change forms nor
4201 go from one part to another for Truth destroys disease
 There is no metastasis no stoppage of harmonious
4203 action no paralysis Truth not error Love
 not hate Spirit not matter governs man If
 students do not readily heal themselves they should
4206 early call an experienced Christian Scientist to aid
 them If they are unwilling to do this for themselves
 they need only to know that error cannot produce this
4209 unnatural reluctance

 Positive reassurance

 Instruct the sick that they are not helpless victims
 for if they will only accept Truth they can resist disease
42012 and ward it off as positively as they can the
 temptation to sin This fact of Christian Sci
 ence should be explained to invalids when they are in a
42015 fit mood to receive it  when they will not array them
 selves against it but are ready to become receptive to the
 new idea The fact that Truth overcomes both disease
42018 and sin reassures depressed hope It imparts a healthy
 stimulus to the body and regulates the system It in
 creases or diminishes the action as the case may require
42021 better than any drug alterative or tonic

 Proper stimulus

 Mind is the natural stimulus of the body but erro
 neous belief taken at its best is not promotive of health
42024 or happiness Tell the sick that they can
 meet disease fearlessly if they only realize
 that divine Love gives them all power over every physical
42027 action and condition

 Awaken the patient

 If it becomes necessary to startle mortal mind to break
 its dream of suffering vehemently tell your patient that
42030 he must awake Turn his gaze from the false
 evidence of the senses to the harmonious facts
 of Soul and immortal being Tell him that he suffers
4211 only as the insane suffer from false beliefs The only
 difference is that insanity implies belief in a diseased
4213 brain while physical ailments socalled arise from the
 belief that other portions of the body are deranged De
 rangement or disarrangement is a word which conveys
4216 the true definition of all human belief in illhealth or dis
 turbed harmony Should you thus startle mortal mind
 in order to remove its beliefs afterwards make known
4219 to the patient your motive for this shock showing him
 that it was to facilitate recovery

 How to treat a crisis

 If a crisis occurs in your treatment you must treat
42112 the patient less for the disease and more for the mental
 disturbance or fermentation and subdue the
 symptoms by removing the belief that this
42115 chemicalization produces pain or disease Insist vehe
 mently on the great fact which covers the whole ground
 that God Spirit is all and that there is none beside
42118 Him There is no disease When the supposed suffer
 ing is gone from mortal mind there can be no pain and
 when the fear is destroyed the inflammation will sub
42121 side Calm the excitement sometimes induced by chemi
 calization which is the alterative effect produced by
 Truth upon error and sometimes explain the symptoms
42124 and their cause to the patient

 No perversion of Mindscience

 It is no more Christianly scientific to see disease than
 it is to experience it If you would destroy the sense
42127 of disease you should not build it up by
 wishing to see the forms it assumes or by
 employing a single material application for
42130 its relief The perversion of Mindscience is like as
 serting that the products of eight multiplied by five and
 of seven by ten are both forty and that their combined
4221 sum is fifty and then calling the process mathematics
 Wiser than his persecutors Jesus said If I by Beelze
4223 bub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them
 out

 Effect of this book

 If the reader of this book observes a great stir through
4226 out his whole system and certain moral and physical
 symptoms seem aggravated these indications
 are favorable Continue to read and the book
4229 will become the physician allaying the tremor which
 Truth often brings to error when destroying it

 Disease neutralized

 Patients unfamiliar with the cause of this commotion
42212 and ignorant that it is a favorable omen may be alarmed
 If such be the case explain to them the law
 of this action As when an acid and alkali
42215 meet and bring out a third quality so mental and moral
 chemistry changes the material base of thought giving
 more spirituality to consciousness and causing it to depend
42218 less on material evidence These changes which go on
 in mortal mind serve to reconstruct the body Thus
 Christian Science by the alchemy of Spirit destroys sin
42221 and death

 Bonehealing by surgery

 Let us suppose two parallel cases of bonedisease both
 similarly produced and attended by the same symptoms
42224 A surgeon is employed in one case and a
 Christian Scientist in the other The sur
 geon holding that matter forms its own conditions and
42227 renders them fatal at certain points entertains fears and
 doubts as to the ultimate outcome of the injury Not
 holding the reins of government in his own hands he
42230 believes that something stronger than Mind  namely
 matter  governs the case His treatment is therefore
 tentative This mental state invites defeat The belief
4231 that he has met his master in matter and may not be
 able to mend the bone increases his fear yet this belief
4233 should not be communicated to the patient either ver
 bally or otherwise for this fear greatly diminishes the
 tendency towards a favorable result Remember that the
4236 unexpressed belief oftentimes affects a sensitive patient
 more strongly than the expressed thought

 Scientific corrective

 The Christian Scientist understanding scientifically
4239 that all is Mind commences with mental causation the
 truth of being to destroy the error This cor
 rective is an alterative reaching to every part
42312 of the human system According to Scripture it searches
 the joints and marrow and it restores the harmony of
 man

 Coping with difficulties

42315 The matterphysician deals with matter as both his foe
 and his remedy He regards the ailment as weakened or
 strengthened according to the evidence which
42318 matter presents The metaphysician making
 Mind his basis of operation irrespective of matter and
 regarding the truth and harmony of being as superior to
42321 error and discord has rendered himself strong instead
 of weak to cope with the case and he proportionately
 strengthens his patient with the stimulus of courage and
42324 conscious power Both Science and consciousness are
 now at work in the economy of being according to the law
 of Mind which ultimately asserts its absolute supremacy

 Formation from thought

42327 Ossification or any abnormal condition or derange
 ment of the body is as directly the action of mortal
 mind as is dementia or insanity Bones have
42330 only the substance of thought which forms
 them They are only phenomena of the mind of mor
 tals The socalled substance of bone is formed first
4241 by the parents mind through selfdivision Soon the
 child becomes a separate individualized mortal mind
4243 which takes possession of itself and its own thoughts of
 bones

 Accidents unknown to God

 Accidents are unknown to God or immortal Mind
4246 and we must leave the mortal basis of belief
 and unite with the one Mind in order to
 change the notion of chance to the proper sense
4249 of Gods unerring direction and thus bring out harmony

 Opposing mentality

 Under divine Providence there can be no accidents
 since there is no room for imperfection in perfection

42412 In medical practice objections would be raised if one
 doctor should administer a drug to counteract the work
 ing of a remedy prescribed by another doctor
42415 It is equally important in metaphysical prac
 tice that the minds which surround your patient should
 not act against your influence by continually expressing
42418 such opinions as may alarm or discourage  either by
 giving antagonistic advice or through unspoken thoughts
 resting on your patient While it is certain that the
42421 divine Mind can remove any obstacle still you need the
 ear of your auditor It is not more difficult to make your
 self heard mentally while others are thinking about your
42424 patients or conversing with them if you understand
 Christian Science  the oneness and the allness of divine
 Love but it is well to be alone with God and the sick
42427 when treating disease

 Mind removes scrofula

 To prevent or to cure scrofula and other socalled he
 reditary diseases you must destroy the belief in these ills
42430 and the faith in the possibility of their trans
 mission The patient may tell you that he
 has a humor in the blood a scrofulous diathesis His
4251 parents or some of his progenitors farther back have so
 believed Mortal mind not matter induces this con
4253 clusion and its results You will have humors just so
 long as you believe them to be safetyvalves or to be
 ineradicable

 Nothing to consume

4256 If the case to be mentally treated is consumption take
 up the leading points included according to belief in
 this disease Show that it is not inherited
4259 that inflammation tubercles hemorrhage and
 decomposition are beliefs images of mortal thought su
 perimposed upon the body that they are not the truth
42512 of man that they should be treated as error and put out
 of thought Then these ills will disappear

 The lungs reformed

 If the body is diseased this is but one of the beliefs of
42515 mortal mind Mortal man will be less mortal when he
 learns that matter never sustained existence
 and can never destroy God who is mans Life
42518 When this is understood mankind will be more spiritual
 and know that there is nothing to consume since Spirit
 God is Allinall What if the belief is consumption
42521 God is more to a man than his belief and the less we ac
 knowledge matter or its laws the more immortality we
 possess Consciousness constructs a better body when
42524 faith in matter has been conquered Correct material
 belief by spiritual understanding and Spirit will form
 you anew You will never fear again except to offend
42527 God and you will never believe that heart or any por
 tion of the body can destroy you

 Soundness maintained

 If you have sound and capacious lungs and want
42530 them to remain so be always ready with the
 mental protest against the opposite belief in
 heredity Discard all notions about lungs tubercles in
4261 herited consumption or disease arising from any cir
 cumstance and you will find that mortal mind when
4263 instructed by Truth yields to divine power which steers
 the body into health

 Our footsteps heavenward

 The discoverer of Christian Science finds the path less
4266 difficult when she has the high goal always before her
 thoughts than when she counts her footsteps
 in endeavoring to reach it When the desti
4269 nation is desirable expectation speeds our progress The
 struggle for Truth makes one strong instead of weak
 resting instead of wearying one If the belief in death
42612 were obliterated and the understanding obtained that
 there is no death this would be a tree of life known
 by its fruits Man should renew his energies and en
42615 deavors and see the folly of hypocrisy while also learn
 ing the necessity of working out his own salvation When
 it is learned that disease cannot destroy life and that
42618 mortals are not saved from sin or sickness by death this
 understanding will quicken into newness of life It will
 master either a desire to die or a dread of the grave
42621 and thus destroy the great fear that besets mortal
 existence

 Christian standard

 The relinquishment of all faith in death and also of
42624 the fear of its sting would raise the standard of health
 and morals far beyond its present elevation
 and would enable us to hold the banner of
42627 Christianity aloft with unflinching faith in God in Life
 eternal Sin brought death and death will disappear
 with the disappearance of sin Man is immortal and
42630 the body cannot die because matter has no life to sur
 render The human concepts named matter death dis
 ease sickness and sin are all that can be destroyed

 Life not contingent on matter

4271 If it is true that man lives this fact can never change
 in Science to the opposite belief that man dies Life is
4273 the law of Soul even the law of the spirit of
 Truth and Soul is never without its represent
 ative Mans individual being can no more
4276 die nor disappear in unconsciousness than can Soul for
 both are immortal If man believes in death now he
 must disbelieve in it when learning that there is no reality
4279 in death since the truth of being is deathless The be
 lief that existence is contingent on matter must be met
 and mastered by Science before Life can be understood
42712 and harmony obtained

 Mortality vanquished

 Death is but another phase of the dream that exist
 ence can be material Nothing can interfere with the
42715 harmony of being nor end the existence of
 man in Science Man is the same after as
 before a bone is broken or the body guillotined If man
42718 is never to overcome death why do the Scriptures say
 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death The
 tenor of the Word shows that we shall obtain the victory
42721 over death in proportion as we overcome sin The great
 difficulty lies in ignorance of what God is God Life
 Truth and Love make man undying Immortal Mind
42724 governing all must be acknowledged as supreme in the
 physical realm socalled as well as in the spiritual

 No death nor inaction

 Called to the bed of death what material remedy has
42727 man when all such remedies have failed Spirit is his
 last resort but it should have been his first
 and only resort The dream of death must
42730 be mastered by Mind here or hereafter Thought
 will waken from its own material declaration I am
 dead to catch this trumpetword of Truth There
4281 is no death no inaction diseased action overaction nor
 reaction

 Vision opening

4283 Life is real and death is the illusion A demonstra
 tion of the facts of Soul in Jesus way resolves the dark
 visions of material sense into harmony and
4286 immortality Mans privilege at this supreme
 moment is to prove the words of our Master If a man
 keep my saying he shall never see death To divest
4289 thought of false trusts and material evidences in order
 that the spiritual facts of being may appear  this is
 the great attainment by means of which we shall sweep
42812 away the false and give place to the true Thus we may
 establish in truth the temple or body whose builder
 and maker is God

 Intelligent consecration

42815 We should consecrate existence not to the unknown
 God whom we ignorantly worship but to the eternal
 builder the everlasting Father to the Life
42818 which mortal sense cannot impair nor mortal
 belief destroy We must realize the ability of mental
 might to offset human misconceptions and to replace them
42821 with the life which is spiritual not material

 The present immortality

 The great spiritual fact must be brought out that man
 is not shall be perfect and immortal We must hold
42824 forever the consciousness of existence and
 sooner or later through Christ and Christian
 Science we must master sin and death The evidence
42827 of mans immortality will become more apparent as ma
 terial beliefs are given up and the immortal facts of being
 are admitted

 Careful guidance

42830 The author has healed hopeless organic disease and
 raised the dying to life and health through the under
 standing of God as the only Life It is a sin to believe
4291 that aught can overpower omnipotent and eternal Life
 and this Life must be brought to light by the understand
4293 ing that there is no death as well as by other
 graces of Spirit We must begin however
 with the more simple demonstrations of control and
4296 the sooner we begin the better The final demonstration
 takes time for its accomplishment When walking we
 are guided by the eye We look before our feet and if
4299 we are wise we look beyond a single step in the line of
 spiritual advancement

 Clay replying to the potter

 The corpse deserted by thought is cold and decays
42912 but it never suffers Science declares that man is sub
 ject to Mind Mortal mind affirms that mind
 is subordinate to the body that the body is
42915 dying that it must be buried and decomposed
 into dust but mortal minds affirmation is not true
 Mortals waken from the dream of death with bodies un
42918 seen by those who think that they bury the body

 Continuity of existence

 If man did not exist before the material organization
 began he could not exist after the body is disintegrated
42921 If we live after death and are immortal we
 must have lived before birth for if Life ever
 had any beginning it must also have an ending even ac
42924 cording to the calculations of natural science Do you
 believe this No Do you understand it No This
 is why you doubt the statement and do not demonstrate
42927 the facts it involves We must have faith in all the say
 ings of our Master though they are not included in the
 teachings of the schools and are not understood gener
42930 ally by our ethical instructors

 Life allinclusive

 Jesus said John viii 51 If a man keep my saying
 he shall never see death That statement is not con
4301 fined to spiritual life but includes all the phenomena of
 existence Jesus demonstrated this healing the dying
4303 and raising the dead Mortal mind must part
 with error must put off itself with its deeds
 and immortal manhood the Christ ideal will appear
4306 Faith should enlarge its borders and strengthen its base
 by resting upon Spirit instead of matter When man
 gives up his belief in death he will advance more rapidly
4309 towards God Life and Love Belief in sickness and
 death as certainly as belief in sin tends to shut out the
 true sense of Life and health When will mankind wake
43012 to this great fact in Science

 I here present to my readers an allegory illustrative
 of the law of divine Mind and of the supposed laws of mat
43015 ter and hygiene an allegory in which the plea of Christian
 Science heals the sick

 A mental court case

 Suppose a mental case to be on trial as cases are tried
43018 in court A man is charged with having committed liver
 complaint The patient feels ill ruminates
 and the trial commences Personal Sense is
43021 the plaintiff Mortal Man is the defendant False Belief
 is the attorney for Personal Sense Mortal Minds Ma
 teria Medica Anatomy Physiology Hypnotism Envy
43024 Greed and Ingratitude constitute the jury The court
 room is filled with interested spectators and Judge
 Medicine is on the bench
43027 The evidence for the prosecution being called for a
 witness testifies thus 

 I represent Healthlaws I was present on certain nights
43030 when the prisoner or patient watched with a sick friend
 Although I have the superintendence of human affairs I
 was personally abused on those occasions I was told that
4311 I must remain silent until called for at this trial when I
 would be allowed to testify in the case Notwithstanding
4313 my rules to the contrary the prisoner watched with the sick
 every night in the week When the sick mortal was thirsty
 the prisoner gave him drink During all this time the pris
4316 oner attended to his daily labors partaking of food at ir
 regular intervals sometimes going to sleep immediately
 after a heavy meal At last he committed livercomplaint
4319 which I considered criminal inasmuch as this offence is
 deemed punishable with death Therefore I arrested Mor
 tal Man in behalf of the state namely the body and cast
43112 him into prison

 At the time of the arrest the prisoner summoned Physi
 ology Materia Medica and Hypnotism to prevent his pun
43115 ishment The struggle on their part was long Materia
 Medica held out the longest but at length all these assist
 ants resigned to me Healthlaws and I succeeded in get
43118 ting Mortal Man into close confinement until I should
 release him

 The next witness is called

43121 I am Coated Tongue I am covered with a foul fur
 placed on me the night of the liverattack Morbid Secre
 tion hypnotized the prisoner and took control of his mind
43124 making him despondent

 Another witness takes the stand and testifies

 I am Sallow Skin I have been dry hot and chilled by
43127 turns since the night of the liverattack I have lost my
 healthy hue and become unsightly although nothing on my
 part has occasioned this change I practise daily ablutions
43130 and perform my functions as usual but I am robbed of my
 good looks

4321 The next witness testifies 

 I am Nerve the State Commissioner for Mortal Man
4323 I am intimately acquainted with the plaintiff Personal
 Sense and know him to be truthful and upright whereas
 Mortal Man the prisoner at the bar is capable of false
4326 hood I was witness to the crime of livercomplaint I
 knew the prisoner would commit it for I convey messages
 from my residence in matter alias brain to body

4329 Another witness is called for by the Court of Error
 and says 

 I am Mortality Governor of the Province of Body in
43212 which Mortal Man resides In this province there is a stat
 ute regarding disease  namely that he upon whose per
 son disease is found shall be treated as a criminal and
43215 punished with death

 The Judge asks if by doing good to his neighbor it is
 possible for man to become diseased transgress the laws
43218 and merit punishment and Governor Mortality replies in
 the affirmative

 Another witness takes the stand and testifies 

43221 I am Death I was called for shortly after the report of
 the crime by the officer of the Board of Health who pro
 tested that the prisoner had abused him and that my pres
43224 ence was required to confirm his testimony One of the
 prisoners friends Materia Medica was present when I
 arrived endeavoring to assist the prisoner to escape from
43227 the hands of justice alias natures socalled law but my
 appearance with a message from the Board of Health
 changed the purpose of Materia Medica and he decided at
43230 once that the prisoner should die

 Judge Medicine charges the jury

4331 The testimony for the plaintiff Personal Sense being
 closed Judge Medicine arises and with great solemnity
4333 addresses the jury of Mortal Minds He an
 alyzes the offence reviews the testimony and
 explains the law relating to livercomplaint
4336 His conclusion is that laws of nature render disease
 homicidal In compliance with a stern duty his Honor
 Judge Medicine urges the jury not to allow their judg
4339 ment to be warped by the irrational unchristian sugges
 tions of Christian Science The jury must regard in such
 cases only the evidence of Personal Sense against Mortal
43312 Man

 As the Judge proceeds the prisoner grows restless His
 sallow face blanches with fear and a look of despair and
43315 death settles upon it The case is given to the jury A
 brief consultation ensues and the jury returns a verdict
 of Guilty of livercomplaint in the first degree

 Mortal Man sentenced

43318 Judge Medicine then proceeds to pronounce the solemn
 sentence of death upon the prisoner Because he has
 loved his neighbor as himself Mortal Man has
43321 been guilty of benevolence in the first degree
 and this has led him into the commission of the second
 crime livercomplaint which material laws condemn as
43324 homicide For this crime Mortal Man is sentenced to
 be tortured until he is dead May God have mercy on
 your soul is the Judges solemn peroration

43327 The prisoner is then remanded to his cell sickbed
 and Scholastic Theology is sent for to prepare the fright
 ened sense of Life God  which sense must be immortal
43330  for death

 Appeal to a higher tribunal

 Ah but Christ Truth the spirit of Life and the
 friend of Mortal Man can open wide those prison doors
4341 and set the captive free Swift on the wings of divine
 Love there comes a despatch Delay the execution
4343 the prisoner is not guilty Consternation fills
 the prisonyard Some exclaim It is con
 trary to law and justice Others say
4346 The law of Christ supersedes our laws let us follow
 Christ

 Counsel for defence

 After much debate and opposition permission is ob
4349 tained for a trial in the Court of Spirit where Christian
 Science is allowed to appear as counsel for
 the unfortunate prisoner Witnesses judges
43412 and jurors who were at the previous Court of Error
 are now summoned to appear before the bar of Justice
 and eternal Truth

43415 When the case for Mortal Man versus Personal Sense
 is opened Mortal Mans counsel regards the prisoner
 with the utmost tenderness The counsels earnest
43418 solemn eyes kindling with hope and triumph look up
 ward Then Christian Science turns suddenly to the
 supreme tribunal and opens the argument for the
43421 defence 

 The prisoner at the bar has been unjustly sentenced
 His trial was a tragedy and is morally illegal Mortal
43424 Man has had no proper counsel in the case All the test
 mony has been on the side of Personal Sense and we shall
 unearth this foul conspiracy against the liberty and life of
43427 Man The only valid testimony in the case shows the
 alleged crime never to have been committed The pris
 oner is not proved worthy of death or of bonds

43430 Your Honor the lower court has sentenced Mortal Man
 to die but God made Man immortal and amenable to
 Spirit only Denying justice to the body that court com
4351 mended mans immortal Spirit to heavenly mercy  Spirit
 which is God Himself and Mans only lawgiver Who or
4353 what has sinned Has the body or has Mortal Mind
 committed a criminal deed Counsellor False Belief has
 argued that the body should die while Reverend Theology
4356 would console conscious Mortal Mind which alone is capa
 ble of sin and suffering The body committed no offence
 Mortal Man in obedience to higher law helped his fellow
4359 man an act which should result in good to himself as well
 as to others

 The law of our Supreme Court decrees that whosoever
43512 sinneth shall die but good deeds are immortal bringing
 joy instead of grief pleasure instead of pain and life
 instead of death If livercomplaint was committed by
43515 trampling on Laws of Health this was a good deed for the
 agent of those laws is an outlaw a destroyer of Mortal
 Mans liberty and rights Laws of Health should be sen
43518 tenced to die

 Watching beside the couch of pain in the exercise of a
 love that is the fulfilling of the law  doing unto
43521 others as ye would that they should do unto you  this
 is no infringement of law for no demand human or divine
 renders it just to punish a man for acting justly If mor
43524 tals sin our Supreme Judge in equity decides what penalty
 is due for the sin and Mortal Man can suffer only for his
 sin For naught else can he be punished according to the
43527 law of Spirit God

 Then what jurisdiction had his Honor Judge Medicine
 in this case To him I might say in Bible language Sit
43530 test thou to judge    after the law and commandest   
 to be smitten contrary to the law The only jurisdiction
 to which the prisoner can submit is that of Truth Life and
43533 Love If they condemn him not neither shall Judge Medi
 cine condemn him and I ask that the prisoner be restored
 to the liberty of which he has been unjustly deprived

4361 The principal witness the officer of the Healthlaws
 deposed that he was an eyewitness to the good deeds for
4363 which Mortal Man is under sentence of death After be
 traying him into the hands of your law the Healthagent
 disappeared to reappear however at the trial as a witness
4366 against Mortal Man and in the interest of Personal Sense
 a murderer Your Supreme Court must find the pris
 oner on the night of the alleged offence to have been acting
4369 within the limits of the divine law and in obedience
 thereto Upon this statute hangs all the law and testimony
 Giving a cup of cold water in Christs name is a Christian
43612 service Laying down his life for a good deed Mortal Man
 should find it again Such acts bear their own justifica
 tion and are under the protection of the Most High

43615 Prior to the night of his arrest the prisoner summoned
 two professed friends Materia Medica and Physiology to
 prevent his committing livercomplaint and thus save him
43618 from arrest But they brought with them Fear the sheriff
 to precipitate the result which they were called to prevent
 It was Fear who handcuffed Mortal Man and would now
43621 punish him You have left Mortal Man no alternative
 He must obey your law fear its consequences and be pun
 ished for his fear His friends struggled hard to rescue the
43624 prisoner from the penalty they considered justly due but
 they were compelled to let him be taken into custody tried
 and condemned Thereupon Judge Medicine sat in judg
43627 ment on the case and substantially charged the jury twelve
 Mortal Minds to find the prisoner guilty His Honor sen
 tenced Mortal Man to die for the very deeds which the di
43630 vine law compels man to commit Thus the Court of Error
 construed obedience to the law of divine Love as disobedi
 ence to the law of Life Claiming to protect Mortal Man
43633 in rightdoing that court pronounced a sentence of death
 for doing right

 One of the principal witnesses Nerve testified that he
4371 was a ruler of Body in which province Mortal Man resides
 He also testified that he was on intimate terms with the
4373 plaintiff and knew Personal Sense to be truthful that he
 knew Man and that Man was made in the image of God
 but was a criminal This is a foul aspersion on mans
4376 Maker It blots the fair escutcheon of omnipotence It in
 dicates malice aforethought a determination to condemn
 Man in the interest of Personal Sense At the bar of Truth
4379 in the presence of divine Justice before the Judge of our
 higher tribunal the Supreme Court of Spirit and before
 its jurors the Spiritual Senses I proclaim this witness
43712 Nerve to be destitute of intelligence and truth and to be
 a false witness

 Man selfdestroyed the testimony of matter respected
43715 Spirit not allowed a hearing Soul a criminal though
 recommended to mercy the helpless innocent body tor
 tured  these are the terrible records of your Court of
43718 Error and I ask that the Supreme Court of Spirit reverse
 this decision

 Here the opposing counsel False Belief called Chris
43721 tian Science to order for contempt of court Various
 notables  Materia Medica Anatomy Physiology Scho
 lastic Theology and Jurisprudence  rose to the ques
43724 tion of expelling Christian Science from the bar for such
 highhanded illegality They declared that Christian Sci
 ence was overthrowing the judicial proceedings of a regu
43727 larly constituted court

 But Judge Justice of the Supreme Court of Spirit over
 ruled their motions on the ground that unjust usages
43730 were not allowed at the bar of Truth which ranks above
 the lower Court of Error

 The attorney Christian Science then read from the
43733 supreme statutebook the Bible certain extracts on the
4381 Rights of Man remarking that the Bible was better au
 thority than Blackstone 

4383 Let us make man in our image after our likeness and
 let them have dominion

 Behold I give unto you power    over all the power
4386 of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you

 If a man keep my saying he shall never see death

 Then Christian Science proved the witness Nerve to
4389 be a perjurer Instead of being a ruler in the Province
 of Body in which Mortal Man was reported to reside
 Nerve was an insubordinate citizen putting in false
43812 claims to office and bearing false witness against Man
 Turning suddenly to Personal Sense by this time silent
 Christian Science continued 

43815 I ask your arrest in the name of Almighty God on three
 distinct charges of crime to wit perjury treason and con
 spiracy against the rights and life of man

43818 Then Christian Science continued

 Another witness equally inadequate said that on the
 night of the crime a garment of foul fur was spread over
43821 him by Morbid Secretion while the facts in the case show
 that this fur is a foreign substance imported by False Be
 lief the attorney for Personal Sense who is in partnership
43824 with Error and smuggles Errors goods into market with
 out the inspection of Souls government officers When
 the Court of Truth summoned Furred Tongue for examina
43827 tion he disappeared and was never heard of more

 Morbid Secretion is not an importer or dealer in fur but
 we have heard Materia Medica explain how this fur is
43830 manufactured and we know Morbid Secretion to be on
 friendly terms with the firm of Personal Sense Error 
4391 Co receiving pay from them and introducing their goods
 into the market Also be it known that False Belief the
4393 counsel for the plaintiff Personal Sense is a buyer for this
 firm He manufactures for it keeps a furnishing store
 and advertises largely for his employers

4396 Death testified that he was absent from the Province of
 Body when a message came from False Belief command
 ing him to take part in the homicide At this request
4399 Death repaired to the spot where the livercomplaint was
 in process frightening away Materia Medica who was then
 manacling the prisoner in the attempt to save him True
43912 Materia Medica was a misguided participant in the misdeed
 for which the Healthofficer had Mortal Man in custody
 though Mortal Man was innocent

43915 Christian Science turned from the abashed witnesses
 his words flashing as lightning in the perturbed faces
 of these worthies Scholastic Theology Materia Medica
43918 Physiology the blind Hypnotism and the masked Per
 sonal Sense and said 

 God will smite you O whited walls for injuring in your
43921 ignorance the unfortunate Mortal Man who sought your
 aid in his struggles against livercomplaint and Death
 You came to his rescue only to fasten upon him an offence
43924 of which he was innocent You aided and abetted Fear
 and Healthlaws You betrayed Mortal Man meanwhile
 declaring Disease to be Gods servant and the righteous
43927 executor of His laws Our higher statutes declare you all
 witnesses jurors and judges to be offenders awaiting the
 sentence which General Progress and Divine Love will
43930 pronounce

 We send our best detectives to whatever locality is re
 ported to be haunted by Disease but on visiting the spot
43933 they learn that Disease was never there for he could not
4401 possibly elude their search Your Material Court of Errors
 when it condemned Mortal Man on the ground of hygienic
4403 disobedience was manipulated by the oleaginous machina
 tions of the counsel False Belief whom Truth arraigns
 before the supreme bar of Spirit to answer for his crime
4406 Morbid Secretion is taught how to make sleep befool reason
 before sacrificing mortals to their false gods

 Mortal Minds were deceived by your attorney False Be
4409 lief and were influenced to give a verdict delivering Mortal
 Man to Death Good deeds are transformed into crimes
 to which you attach penalties but no warping of justice
44012 can render disobedience to the socalled laws of Matter
 disobedience to God or an act of homicide Even penal
 law holds homicide under stress of circumstances to be
44015 justifiable Now what greater justification can any deed
 have than that it is for the good of ones neighbor Where
 fore then in the name of outraged justice do you sentence
44018 Mortal Man for ministering to the wants of his fellowman
 in obedience to divine law You cannot trample upon the
 decree of the Supreme Bench Mortal Man has his appeal
44021 to Spirit God who sentences only for sin

 The false and unjust beliefs of your human mental legis
 lators compel them to enact wicked laws of sickness and so
44024 forth and then render obedience to these laws punishable
 as crime In the presence of the Supreme Lawgiver stand
 ing at the bar of Truth and in accordance with the divine
44027 statutes I repudiate the false testimony of Personal Sense
 I ask that he be forbidden to enter against Mortal Man
 any more suits to be tried at the Court of Material Error
44030 I appeal to the just and equitable decisions of divine Spirit
 to restore to Mortal Man the rights of which he has been
 deprived

 Charge of the Chief Justice

44033 Here the counsel for the defence closed and the Chief
 Justice of the Supreme Court with benign and imposing
4411 presence comprehending and defining all law and evi
 dence explained from his statutebook the
4413 Bible that any socalled law which under
 takes to punish aught but sin is null and void

 He also decided that the plaintiff Personal Sense be
4416 not permitted to enter any suits at the bar of Soul but
 be enjoined to keep perpetual silence and in case of
 temptation to give heavy bonds for good behavior He
4419 concluded his charge thus 

 The plea of False Belief we deem unworthy of a hearing
 Let what False Belief utters now and forever fall into
44112 oblivion unknelled uncoffined and unknown Accord
 ing to our statute Material Law is a liar who cannot bear
 witness against Mortal Man neither can Fear arrest Mortal
44115 Man nor can Disease cast him into prison Our law refuses
 to recognize Man as sick or dying but holds him to be for
 ever in the image and likeness of his Maker Reversing the
44118 testimony of Personal Sense and the decrees of the Court of
 Error in favor of Matter Spirit decides in favor of Man
 and against Matter We further recommend that Materia
44121 Medica adopt Christian Science and that Healthlaws
 Mesmerism Hypnotism Oriental Witchcraft and Esoteric
 Magic be publicly executed at the hands of our sheriff
44124 Progress

 The Supreme Bench decides in favor of intelligence that
 no law outside of divine Mind can punish or reward Mortal
44127 Man Your personal jurors in the Court of Error are
 myths Your attorney False Belief is an impostor per
 suading Mortal Minds to return a verdict contrary to law
44130 and gospel The plaintiff Personal Sense is recorded in
 our Book of books as a liar Our great Teacher of mental
 jurisprudence speaks of him also as a murderer from the
44133 beginning We have no trials for sickness before the tri
4421 bunal of divine Spirit There Man is adjudged innocent
 of transgressing physical laws because there are no such
4423 laws Our statute is spiritual our Government is divine
 Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right

 Divine verdict

 The Jury of Spiritual Senses agreed at once upon a
4426 verdict and there resounded throughout the vast audience
 chamber of Spirit the cry Not guilty Then
 the prisoner rose up regenerated strong free
4429 We noticed as he shook hands with his counsel Chris
 tian Science that all sallowness and debility had dis
 appeared His form was erect and commanding his
44212 countenance beaming with health and happiness Divine
 Love had cast out fear Mortal Man no longer sick
 and in prison walked forth his feet beautiful upon the
44215 mountains as of one that bringeth good tidings

 Christ the great physician

 Neither animal magnetism nor hypnotism enters into
 the practice of Christian Science in which truth cannot
44218 be reversed but the reverse of error is true
 An improved belief cannot retrograde When
 Christ changes a belief of sin or of sickness into
44221 a better belief then belief melts into spiritual understand
 ing and sin disease and death disappear Christ Truth
 gives mortals temporary food and clothing until the ma
44224 terial transformed with the ideal disappears and man
 is clothed and fed spiritually St Paul says Work
 out your own salvation with fear and trembling Jesus
44227 said Fear not little flock for it is your Fathers good
 pleasure to give you the kingdom This truth is
 Christian Science

44230 Christian Scientists be a law to yourselves that mental
 malpractice cannot harm you either when asleep or when
 awake




 CHAPTER XIII  TEACHING CHRISTIAN SCIENCE

 Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser
 teach a just man and he will increase in learning  PROVERBS

 Study of medicine

4431 WHEN the discoverer of Christian Science is con
 sulted by her followers as to the propriety advan
4433 tage and consistency of systematic medical
 study she tries to show them that under ordi
 nary circumstances a resort to faith in corporeal means
4436 tends to deter those who make such a compromise from
 entire confidence in omnipotent Mind as really possessing
 all power While a course of medical study is at times
4439 severely condemned by some Scientists she feels as she
 always has felt that all are privileged to work out their
 own salvation according to their light and that our motto
44312 should be the Masters counsel Judge not that ye be
 not judged

 Failures lessons

 If patients fail to experience the healing power of
44315 Christian Science and think they can be benefited by
 certain ordinary physical methods of medical
 treatment then the Mindphysician should
44318 give up such cases and leave invalids free to resort to
 whatever other systems they fancy will afford relief
 Thus such invalids may learn the value of the apostolic
44321 precept Reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering
 and doctrine If the sick find these material expedients
4441 unsatisfactory and they receive no help from them these
 very failures may open their blind eyes In some way
4443 sooner or later all must rise superior to materiality and
 suffering is oft the divine agent in this elevation All
 things work together for good to them that love God is
4446 the dictum of Scripture

 Refuge and strength

 If Christian Scientists ever fail to receive aid from
 other Scientists  their brethren upon whom they may
4449 call  God will still guide them into the right
 use of temporary and eternal means Step by
 step will those who trust Him find that God is our refuge
44412 and strength a very present help in trouble

 Charity to those opposed

 Students are advised by the author to be charitable
 and kind not only towards differing forms of religion
44415 and medicine but to those who hold these dif
 fering opinions Let us be faithful in pointing
 the way through Christ as we understand it
44418 but let us also be careful always to judge righteous judg
 ment and never to condemn rashly Whosoever shall
 smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also
44421 That is Fear not that he will smite thee again for thy for
 bearance If ecclesiastical sects or medical schools turn
 a deaf ear to the teachings of Christian Science then part
44424 from these opponents as did Abraham when he parted
 from Lot and say in thy heart Let there be no strife I
 pray thee between me and thee and between My herd
44427 men and thy herdmen for we be brethren Immortals
 or Gods children in divine Science are one harmonious
 family but mortals or the children of men in material
44430 sense are discordant and ofttimes false brethren

 Conforming to explicit rules

 The teacher must make clear to students the Science
 of healing especially its ethics  that all is Mind and
4451 that the Scientist must conform to Gods requirements
 Also the teacher must thoroughly fit his students to defend
4453 themselves against sin and to guard against the
 attacks of the wouldbe mental assassin who
 attempts to kill morally and physically No
4456 hypothesis as to the existence of another power should
 interpose a doubt or fear to hinder the demonstration of
 Christian Science Unfold the latent energies and capac
4459 ities for good in your pupil Teach the great possibilities
 of man endued with divine Science Teach the dangerous
 possibility of dwarfing the spiritual understanding and
44512 demonstration of Truth by sin or by recourse to material
 means for healing Teach the meekness and might of life
 hid with Christ in God and there will be no desire for
44515 other healing methods You render the divine law of
 healing obscure and void when you weigh the human in
 the scale with the divine or limit in any direction of
44518 thought the omnipresence and omnipotence of God

 Divine energy

 Christian Science silences human will quiets fear with
 Truth and Love and illustrates the unlabored motion
44521 of the divine energy in healing the sick Self
 seeking envy passion pride hatred and
 revenge are cast out by the divine Mind which heals
44524 disease The human will which maketh and worketh a lie
 hiding the divine Principle of harmony is destructive to
 health and is the cause of disease rather than its cure

 Blight of avarice

44527 There is great danger in teaching Mindhealing indis
 criminately thus disregarding the morals of the student
 and caring only for the fees Recalling Jeffer
44530 sons words about slavery I tremble when I
 remember that God is just the author trembles whenever
 she sees a man for the petty consideration of money
4461 teaching his slight knowledge of Mindpower  per
 haps communicating his own bad morals and in this way
4463 dealing pitilessly with a community unprepared for self
 defence

 A thorough perusal of the authors publications heals
4466 sickness If patients sometimes seem worse while read
 ing this book the change may either arise from the alarm
 of the physician or it may mark the crisis of the disease
4469 Perseverance in the perusal of the book has generally
 completely healed such cases

 Exclusion of malpractice

 Whoever practises the Science the author teaches
44612 through which Mind pours light and healing upon this
 generation can practise on no one from sin
 ister or malicious motives without destroying
44615 his own power to heal and his own health Good must
 dominate in the thoughts of the healer or his demon
 stration is protracted dangerous and impossible in Sci
44618 ence A wrong motive involves defeat In the Science
 of Mindhealing it is imperative to be honest for victory
 rests on the side of immutable right To understand
44621 God strengthens hope enthrones faith in Truth and
 verifies Jesus word Lo I am with you alway even
 unto the end of the world

 Iniquity overcome

44624 Resisting evil you overcome it and prove its nothing
 ness Not human platitudes but divine beatitudes re
 flect the spiritual light and might which heal
44627 the sick The exercise of will brings on a
 hypnotic state detrimental to health and integrity of
 thought This must therefore be watched and guarded
44630 against Covering iniquity will prevent prosperity and the
 ultimate triumph of any cause Ignorance of the error
 to be eradicated oftentimes subjects you to its abuse

 No trespass on human rights

4471 The heavenly law is broken by trespassing upon
 mans individual right of selfgovernment We have no
4473 authority in Christian Science and no moral
 right to attempt to influence the thoughts of
 others except it be to benefit them In men
4476 tal practice you must not forget that erring human opin
 ions conflicting selfish motives and ignorant attempts
 to do good may render you incapable of knowing or
4479 judging accurately the need of your fellowmen There
 fore the rule is heal the sick when called upon for aid
 and save the victims of the mental assassins

 Expose sin without believing in it

44712 Ignorance subtlety or false charity does not for
 ever conceal error evil will in time disclose and pun
 ish itself The recuperative action of the
44715 system when mentally sustained by Truth
 goes on naturally When sin or sickness 
 the reverse of harmony  seems true to material sense
44718 impart without frightening or discouraging the pa
 tient the truth and spiritual understanding which de
 stroy disease Expose and denounce the claims of
44721 evil and disease in all their forms but realize no
 reality in them A sinner is not reformed merely
 by assuring him that he cannot be a sinner because
44724 there is no sin To put down the claim of sin
 you must detect it remove the mask point out the
 illusion and thus get the victory over sin and so prove
44727 its unreality The sick are not healed merely by
 declaring there is no sickness but by knowing that
 there is none

 Wicked evasions

44730 A sinner is afraid to cast the first stone He may
 say as a subterfuge that evil is unreal but to know it
 he must demonstrate his statement To assume that
4481 there are no claims of evil and yet to indulge them is
 a moral offence Blindness and selfrighteousness cling
4483 fast to iniquity When the Publicans wail
 went out to the great heart of Love it won his
 humble desire Evil which obtains in the bodily senses
4486 but which the heart condemns has no foundation but if
 evil is uncondemned it is undenied and nurtured Under
 such circumstances to say that there is no evil is an evil
4489 in itself When needed tell the truth concerning the lie
 Evasion of Truth cripples integrity and casts thee down
 from the pinnacle

 Truths grand results

44812 Christian Science rises above the evidence of the cor
 poreal senses but if you have not risen above sin your
 self do not congratulate yourself upon your
44815 blindness to evil or upon the good you know
 and do not A dishonest position is far from Christianly
 scientific He that covereth his sins shall not prosper
44818 but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
 mercy Try to leave on every students mind the strong
 impress of divine Science a high sense of the moral and
44821 spiritual qualifications requisite for healing well knowing
 it to be impossible for error evil and hate to accomplish
 the grand results of Truth and Love The reception or
44824 pursuit of instructions opposite to absolute Christian
 Science must always hinder scientific demonstration

 Adherence to righteousness

 If the student adheres strictly to the teachings of Chris
44827 tian Science and ventures not to break its rules he can
 not fail of success in healing It is Christian
 Science to do right and nothing short of right
44830 doing has any claim to the name To talk the right and
 live the wrong is foolish deceit doing ones self the most
 harm Fettered by sin yourself it is difficult to free
4491 another from the fetters of disease With your own wrists
 manacled it is hard to break anothers chains A little
4493 leaven causes the whole mass to ferment A grain of
 Christian Science does wonders for mortals so omnip
 otent is Truth but more of Christian Science must be
4496 gained in order to continue in well doing

 Right adjusts the balance

 The wrong done another reacts most heavily against
 ones self Right adjusts the balance sooner or later
4499 Think it easier for a camel to go through
 the eye of a needle than for you to benefit
 yourself by injuring others Mans moral mercury ris
44912 ing or falling registers his healing ability and fitness to
 teach You should practise well what you know and
 you will then advance in proportion to your honesty
44915 and fidelity  qualities which insure success in this
 Science but it requires a higher understanding to teach
 this subject properly and correctly than it does to heal
44918 the most difficult case

 Inoculation of thought

 The baneful effect of evil associates is less seen than
 felt The inoculation of evil human thoughts ought to
44921 be understood and guarded against The
 first impression made on a mind which is
 attracted or repelled according to personal merit or de
44924 merit is a good detective of individual character Cer
 tain minds meet only to separate through simultaneous
 repulsion They are enemies without the preliminary
44927 offence The impure are at peace with the impure
 Only virtue is a rebuke to vice A proper teacher of Chris
 tian Science improves the health and the morals of his
44930 student if the student practises what he is taught and
 unless this result follows the teacher is a Scientist only
 in name

 Three classes of neophytes

4501 There is a large class of thinkers whose bigotry and
 conceit twist every fact to suit themselves Their creed
4503 teaches belief in a mysterious supernatural
 God and in a natural allpowerful devil An
 other class still more unfortunate are so depraved that
4506 they appear to be innocent They utter a falsehood
 while looking you blandly in the face and they never
 fail to stab their benefactor in the back A third class
4509 of thinkers build with solid masonry They are sincere
 generous noble and are therefore open to the approach
 and recognition of Truth To teach Christian Science
45012 to such as these is no task They do not incline long
 ingly to error whine over the demands of Truth nor
 play the traitor for place and power

 Touchstone of Science

45015 Some people yield slowly to the touch of Truth Few
 yield without a struggle and many are reluctant to ac
 knowledge that they have yielded but un
45018 less this admission is made evil will boast
 itself above good The Christian Scientist has enlisted
 to lessen evil disease and death and he will overcome
45021 them by understanding their nothingness and the allness
 of God or good Sickness to him is no less a temptation
 than is sin and he heals them both by understanding
45024 Gods power over them The Christian Scientist knows
 that they are errors of belief which Truth can and will
 destroy

 False claims annihilated

45027 Who that has felt the perilous beliefs in life substance
 and intelligence separated from God can say that there
 is no error of belief Knowing the claim of
45030 animal magnetism that all evil combines in
 the belief of life substance and intelligence in matter
 electricity animal nature and organic life who will deny
4511 that these are the errors which Truth must and will an
 nihilate Christian Scientists must live under the con
4513 stant pressure of the apostolic command to come out from
 the material world and be separate They must re
 nounce aggression oppression and the pride of power
4516 Christianity with the crown of Love upon her brow
 must be their queen of life

 Treasure in heaven

 Students of Christian Science who start with its letter
4519 and think to succeed without the spirit will either make
 shipwreck of their faith or be turned sadly
 awry They must not only seek but strive
45112 to enter the narrow path of Life for wide is the gate
 and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and
 many there be which go in thereat Man walks in the
45115 direction towards which he looks and where his treasure
 is there will his heart be also If our hopes and affec
 tions are spiritual they come from above not from be
45118 neath and they bear as of old the fruits of the Spirit

 Obligations of teachers

 Every Christian Scientist every conscientious teacher
 of the Science of Mindhealing knows that human will
45121 is not Christian Science and he must recog
 nize this in order to defend himself from the
 influence of human will He feels morally obligated to
45124 open the eyes of his students that they may perceive the
 nature and methods of error of every sort especially any
 subtle degree of evil deceived and deceiving All mental
45127 malpractice arises from ignorance or malice aforethought
 It is the injurious action of one mortal mind controlling
 another from wrong motives and it is practised either
45130 with a mistaken or a wicked purpose

 Indispensable defence

 Show your student that mental malpractice tends to
 blast moral sense health and the human life Instruct
4521 him how to bar the door of his thought against this
 seeming power  a task not difficult when one under
4523 stands that evil has in reality no power
 Incorrect reasoning leads to practical error
 The wrong thought should be arrested before it has a
4526 chance to manifest itself

 Egotistic darkness

 Walking in the light we are accustomed to the light
 and require it we cannot see in darkness But eyes ac
4529 customed to darkness are pained by the light
 When outgrowing the old you should not fear
 to put on the new Your advancing course may pro
45212 voke envy but it will also attract respect When error
 confronts you withhold not the rebuke or the explana
 tion which destroys error Never breathe an immoral
45215 atmosphere unless in the attempt to purify it Better is
 the frugal intellectual repast with contentment and virtue
 than the luxury of learning with egotism and vice

 Unwarranted expectations

45218 Right is radical The teacher must know the truth
 himself He must live it and love it or he cannot impart
 it to others We soil our garments with con
45221 servatism and afterwards we must wash them
 clean When the spiritual sense of Truth unfolds its
 harmonies you take no risks in the policy of error Ex
45224 pect to heal simply by repeating the authors words by
 right talking and wrong acting and you will be disap
 pointed Such a practice does not demonstrate the
45227 Science by which divine Mind heals the sick

 Reliable authority

 Acting from sinful motives destroys your power of
 healing from the right motive On the other hand if
45230 you had the inclination or power to practise
 wrongly and then should adopt Christian
 Science the wrong power would be destroyed You do
4531 not deny the mathematicians right to distinguish the cor
 rect from the incorrect among the examples on the black
4533 board nor disbelieve the musician when he distinguishes
 concord from discord In like manner it should be granted
 that the author understands what she is saying

 Winning the field

4536 Right and wrong truth and error will be at strife in
 the minds of students until victory rests on the side of
 invincible truth Mental chemicalization fol
4539 lows the explanation of Truth and a higher
 basis is thus won but with some individuals the morbid
 moral or physical symptoms constantly reappear I
45312 have never witnessed so decided effects from the use of
 material remedies as from the use of spiritual

 Knowledge and honesty

 Teach your student that he must know himself be
45315 fore he can know others and minister to human needs
 Honesty is spiritual power Dishonesty is
 human weakness which forfeits divine help
45318 You uncover sin not in order to injure but in order
 to bless the corporeal man and a right motive has
 its reward Hidden sin is spiritual wickedness in high
45321 places The masquerader in this Science thanks God
 that there is no evil yet serves evil in the name of
 good

 Metaphysical treatment

45324 You should treat sickness mentally just as you would
 sin except that you must not tell the patient that he is
 sick nor give names to diseases for such a
45327 course increases fear the foundation of dis
 ease and impresses more deeply the wrong mindpicture
 A Christian Scientists medicine is Mind the divine Truth
45330 that makes man free A Christian Scientist never recom
 mends material hygiene never manipulates He does
 not trespass on the rights of mind nor can he practise
4541 animal magnetism or hypnotism It need not be added
 that the use of tobacco or intoxicating drinks is not in
4543 harmony with Christian Science

 Impotence of hate

 Teach your students the omnipotence of Truth which
 illustrates the impotence of error The understanding
4546 even in a degree of the divine Allpower de
 stroys fear and plants the feet in the true path
  the path which leads to the house built without hands
4549 eternal in the heavens Human hate has no legiti
 mate mandate and no kingdom Love is enthroned
 That evil or matter has neither intelligence nor power
45412 is the doctrine of absolute Christian Science and this is
 the great truth which strips all disguise from error

 Love the incentive

 He who understands in sufficient degree the Princi
45415 ple of Mindhealing points out to his student error as
 well as truth the wrong as well as the right
 practice Love for God and man is the true
45418 incentive in both healing and teaching Love inspires
 illumines designates and leads the way Right motives
 give pinions to thought and strength and freedom to
45421 speech and action Love is priestess at the altar of
 Truth Wait patiently for divine Love to move upon the
 waters of mortal mind and form the perfect concept
45424 Patience must have her perfect work

 Continuity of interest

 Do not dismiss students at the close of a class term
 feeling that you have no more to do for them Let your
45427 loving care and counsel support all their feeble
 footsteps until your students tread firmly in
 the straight and narrow way The superiority of spir
45430 itual power over sensuous is the central point of Chris
 tian Science Remember that the letter and mental
 argument are only human auxiliaries to aid in bringing
4551 thought into accord with the spirit of Truth and Love
 which heals the sick and the sinner

 Weakness and guilt

4553 A mental state of selfcondemnation and guilt or a
 faltering and doubting trust in Truth are unsuitable
 conditions for healing the sick Such mental
4556 states indicate weakness instead of strength
 Hence the necessity of being right yourself in order to
 teach this Science of healing You must utilize the moral
4559 might of Mind in order to walk over the waves of error
 and support your claims by demonstration If you are
 yourself lost in the belief and fear of disease or sin and
45512 if knowing the remedy you fail to use the energies of
 Mind in your own behalf you can exercise little or no
 power for others help First cast out the beam out
45515 of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast
 out the mote out of thy brothers eye

 The trust of the Allwise

 The student who receives his knowledge of Christian
45518 Science or metaphysical healing from a human teacher
 may be mistaken in judgment and demonstra
 tion but God cannot mistake God selects
45521 for the highest service one who has grown into such a
 fitness for it as renders any abuse of the mission an im
 possibility The Allwise does not bestow His highest
45524 trusts upon the unworthy When He commissions a mes
 senger it is one who is spiritually near Himself No per
 son can misuse this mental power if he is taught of God
45527 to discern it

 Integrity assured

 This strong point in Christian Science is not to be
 overlooked  that the same fountain cannot send forth
45530 both sweet waters and bitter The higher
 your attainment in the Science of mental
 healing and teaching the more impossible it will be
4561 come for you intentionally to influence mankind adverse
 to its highest hope and achievement

 Chicanery impossible

4563 Teaching or practising in the name of Truth but con
 trary to its spirit or rules is most dangerous quackery
 Strict adherence to the divine Principle and
4566 rules of the scientific method has secured
 the only success of the students of Christian Science
 This alone entitles them to the high standing which
4569 most of them hold in the community a reputation ex
 perimentally justified by their efforts Whoever af
 firms that there is more than one Principle and method
45612 of demonstrating Christian Science greatly errs igno
 rantly or intentionally and separates himself from the
 true conception of Christian Science healing and from
45615 its possible demonstration

 No dishonest concessions

 Any dishonesty in your theory and practice betrays a
 gross ignorance of the method of the Christcure Science
45618 makes no concessions to persons or opinions
 One must abide in the morale of truth or he
 cannot demonstrate the divine Principle So long as
45621 matter is the basis of practice illness cannot be effica
 ciously treated by the metaphysical process Truth does
 the work and you must both understand and abide by the
45624 divine Principle of your demonstration

 This volume indispensable

 A Christian Scientist requires my work SCIENCE AND
 HEALTH for his textbook and so do all his students and
45627 patients Why First Because it is the voice
 of Truth to this age and contains the full
 statement of Christian Science or the Science of healing
45630 through Mind Second Because it was the first book
 known containing a thorough statement of Christian
 Science Hence it gave the first rules for demonstrating
4571 this Science and registered the revealed Truth uncon
 taminated by human hypotheses Other works which
4573 have borrowed from this book without giving it credit
 have adulterated the Science Third Because this book
 has done more for teacher and student for healer and
4576 patient than has been accomplished by other books

 Purity of science

 Since the divine light of Christian Science first dawned
 upon the author she has never used this newly discovered
4579 power in any direction which she fears to have
 fairly understood Her prime object since
 entering this field of labor has been to prevent suffering
45712 not to produce it That we cannot scientifically both
 cure and cause disease is selfevident In the legend of
 the shield which led to a quarrel between two knights
45715 because each of them could see but one face of it both
 sides were beautiful according to their degree but to
 mental malpractice prolific of evil there is no good as
45718 pect either silvern or golden

 Backsliders and mistakes

 Christian Science is not an exception to the general
 rule that there is no excellence without labor in a direct
45721 line One cannot scatter his fire and at the
 same time hit the mark To pursue other
 vocations and advance rapidly in the demonstration of
45724 this Science is not possible Departing from Christian
 Science some learners commend diet and hygiene
 They even practise these intending thereby to initiate
45727 the cure which they mean to complete with Mind as if
 the nonintelligent could aid Mind The Scientists
 demonstration rests on one Principle and there must
45730 and can be no opposite rule Let this Principle be ap
 plied to the cure of disease without exploiting other
 means

 Mental charlatanism

4581 Mental quackery rests on the same platform as all
 other quackery The chief plank in this platform is the
4583 doctrine that Science has two principles in
 partnership one good and the other evil 
 one spiritual the other material  and that these two
4586 may be simultaneously at work on the sick This
 theory is supposed to favor practice from both a mental
 and a material standpoint Another plank in the plat
4589 form is this that error will finally have the same effect
 as truth

 Divinity ever ready

 It is anything but scientifically Christian to think of
45812 aiding the divine Principle of healing or of trying to sus
 tain the human body until the divine Mind
 is ready to take the case Divinity is always
45815 ready Semper paratus is Truths motto Having seen
 so much suffering from quackery the author desires to
 keep it out of Christian Science The twoedged sword
45818 of Truth must turn in every direction to guard the tree
 of life

 The panoply of wisdom

 Sin makes deadly thrusts at the Christian Scientist as
45821 ritualism and creed are summoned to give place to higher
 law but Science will ameliorate mortal malice
 The Christianly scientific man reflects the
45824 divine law thus becoming a law unto himself He does
 violence to no man Neither is he a false accuser The
 Christian Scientist wisely shapes his course and is hon
45827 est and consistent in following the leadings of divine
 Mind He must prove through living as well as heal
 ing and teaching that Christs way is the only one
45830 by which mortals are radically saved from sin and
 sickness

 Advancement by sacrifice

 Christianity causes men to turn naturally from matter
4591 to Spirit as the flower turns from darkness to light
 Man then appropriates those things which eye hath
4593 not seen nor ear heard Paul and John
 had a clear apprehension that as mortal man
 achieves no worldly honors except by sacrifice
4596 so he must gain heavenly riches by forsaking all worldli
 ness Then he will have nothing in common with the
 worldlings affections motives and aims Judge not the
4599 future advancement of Christian Science by the steps
 already taken lest you yourself be condemned for fail
 ing to take the first step

 Dangerous knowledge

45912 Any attempt to heal mortals with erring mortal mind
 instead of resting on the omnipotence of the divine
 Mind must prove abortive Committing the
45915 bare process of mental healing to frail mor
 tals untaught and unrestrained by Christian Science
 is like putting a sharp knife into the hands of a blind
45918 man or a raging maniac and turning him loose in
 the crowded streets of a city Whether animated by
 malice or ignorance a false practitioner will work mis
45921 chief and ignorance is more harmful than wilful wicked
 ness when the latter is distrusted and thwarted in its
 incipiency

 Certainty of results

45924 To mortal sense Christian Science seems abstract but
 the process is simple and the results are sure if the Science
 is understood The tree must be good which
45927 produces good fruit Guided by divine Truth
 and not guesswork the theologus that is the student 
 the Christian and scientific expounder  of the divine
45930 law treats disease with more certain results than any
 other healer on the globe The Christian Scientist should
 understand and adhere strictly to the rules of divine meta
4601 physics as laid down in this work and rest his demonstra
 tion on this sure basis

 Ontology defined

4603 Ontology is defined as the science of the necessary
 constituents and relations of all beings and it under
 lies all metaphysical practice Our system of
4606 Mindhealing rests on the apprehension of the
 nature and essence of all being  on the divine Mind
 and Loves essential qualities Its pharmacy is moral
4609 and its medicine is intellectual and spiritual though used
 for physical healing Yet this most fundamental part of
 metaphysics is the one most difficult to understand and
46012 demonstrate for to the material thought all is material
 till such thought is rectified by Spirit

 Mischievous imagination

 Sickness is neither imaginary nor unreal  that is
46015 to the frightened false sense of the patient Sickness
 is more than fancy it is solid conviction It
 is therefore to be dealt with through right ap
46018 prehension of the truth of being If Christian healing
 is abused by mere smatterers in Science it becomes a
 tedious mischiefmaker Instead of scientifically effect
46021 ing a cure it starts a petty crossfire over every cripple
 and invalid buffeting them with the superficial and cold
 assertion Nothing ails you

 Authors early instructions

46024 When the Science of Mind was a fresh revelation to
 the author she had to impart while teaching its grand
 facts the hue of spiritual ideas from her own
46027 spiritual condition and she had to do this orally
 through the meagre channel afforded by language and by
 her manuscript circulated among the students As for
46030 mer beliefs were gradually expelled from her thought the
 teaching became clearer until finally the shadow of old
 errors was no longer cast upon divine Science

 Proof by induction

 I do not maintain that anyone can exist in the flesh
 without food and raiment but I do believe that the
4613 real man is immortal and that he lives in
 Spirit not matter Christian Science must
 be accepted at this period by induction We admit the
4616 whole because a part is proved and that part illustrates
 and proves the entire Principle Christian Science can
 be taught only by those who are morally advanced and
4619 spiritually endowed for it is not superficial nor is it
 discerned from the standpoint of the human senses
 Only by the illumination of the spiritual sense can
46112 the light of understanding be thrown upon this Science
 because Science reverses the evidence before the material
 senses and furnishes the eternal interpretation of God and
46115 man

 If you believe that you are sick should you say  I am
 sick No but you should tell your belief sometimes
46118 if this be requisite to protect others If you commit a
 crime should you acknowledge to yourself that you are
 a criminal Yes Your responses should differ because
46121 of the different effects they produce Usually to admit
 that you are sick renders your case less curable while
 to recognize your sin aids in destroying it Both sin and
46124 sickness are error and Truth is their remedy The truth
 regarding error is that error is not true hence it is unreal
 To prove scientifically the error or unreality of sin you
46127 must first see the claim of sin and then destroy it
 Whereas to prove scientifically the error or unreality of
 disease you must mentally unsee the disease then you
46130 will not feel it and it is destroyed

 Rapidity of assimilation

 Systematic teaching and the students spiritual growth
 and experience in practice are requisite for a thorough
4621 comprehension of Christian Science Some individu
 als assimilate truth more readily than others but any
4623 student who adheres to the divine rules
 of Christian Science and imbibes the spirit
 of Christ can demonstrate Christian Science cast out
4626 error heal the sick and add continually to his store of
 spiritual understanding potency enlightenment and
 success

 Divided loyalty

4629 If the student goes away to practise Truths teach
 ings only in part dividing his interests between God and
 mammon and substituting his own views for
46212 Truth he will inevitably reap the error he sows
 Whoever would demonstrate the healing of Christian
 Science must abide strictly by its rules heed every state
46215 ment and advance from the rudiments laid down There
 is nothing difficult nor toilsome in this task when the way
 is pointed out but selfdenial sincerity Christianity and
46218 persistence alone win the prize as they usually do in every
 department of life

 Anatomy defined

 Anatomy when conceived of spiritually is mental self
46221 knowledge and consists in the dissection of thoughts to
 discover their quality quantity and origin
 Are thoughts divine or human That is the
46224 important question This branch of study is indispen
 sable to the excision of error The anatomy of Christian
 Science teaches when and how to probe the selfin
46227 flicted wounds of selfishness malice envy and hate It
 teaches the control of mad ambition It unfolds the
 hallowed influences of unselfishness philanthropy spir
46230 itual love It urges the government of the body both
 in health and in sickness The Christian Scientist
 through understanding mental anatomy discerns and
4631 deals with the real cause of disease The material physi
 cian gropes among phenomena which fluctuate every in
4633 stant under influences not embraced in his diagnosis and
 so he may stumble and fall in the darkness

 Scientific obstetrics

 Teacher and student should also be familiar with the
4636 obstetrics taught by this Science To attend properly
 the birth of the new child or divine idea
 you should so detach mortal thought from its
4639 material conceptions that the birth will be natural and
 safe Though gathering new energy this idea cannot
 injure its useful surroundings in the travail of spiritual
46312 birth A spiritual idea has not a single element of error
 and this truth removes properly whatever is offensive
 The new idea conceived and born of Truth and Love is
46315 clad in white garments Its beginning will be meek its
 growth sturdy and its maturity undecaying When
 this new birth takes place the Christian Science infant
46318 is born of the Spirit born of God and can cause the
 mother no more suffering By this we know that Truth
 is here and has fulfilled its perfect work

 Unhesitating decision

46321 To decide quickly as to the proper treatment of error 
 whether error is manifested in forms of sickness sin
 or death  is the first step towards destroy
46324 ing error Our Master treated error through
 Mind He never enjoined obedience to the laws of nature
 if by these are meant laws of matter nor did he use drugs
46327 There is a law of God applicable to healing and it is a
 spiritual law instead of material The sick are not healed
 by inanimate matter or drugs as they believe that they
46330 are Such seeming medical effect or action is that of so
 called mortal mind

 Seclusion of the author

 It has been said to the author The world is bene
4641 fited by you but it feels your influence without seeing
 you Why do you not make yourself more widely
4643 known Could her friends know how little
 time the author has had in which to make
 herself outwardly known except through her laborious
4646 publications  and how much time and toil are still re
 quired to establish the stately operations of Christian
 Science  they would understand why she is so secluded
4649 Others could not take her place even if willing so to do
 She therefore remains unseen at her post seeking no self
 aggrandizement but praying watching and working for
46412 the redemption of mankind

 If from an injury or from any cause a Christian Scien
 tist were seized with pain so violent that he could not
46415 treat himself mentally  and the Scientists had failed
 to relieve him  the sufferer could call a surgeon who
 would give him a hypodermic injection then when the
46418 belief of pain was lulled he could handle his own case
 mentally Thus it is that we prove all things and
 hold fast that which is good

 The right motive and its reward

46421 In founding a pathological system of Christianity the
 author has labored to expound divine Principle and not
 to exalt personality The weapons of bigotry
46424 ignorance envy fall before an honest heart
 Adulterating Christian Science makes it void
 Falsity has no foundation The hireling fleeth because
46427 he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep Neither
 dishonesty nor ignorance ever founded nor can they over
 throw a scientific system of ethics

4651 THIS chapter is from the first edition of the authors

 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

 Question  What is God
4659 Answer  God is incorporeal divine supreme infinite
 Mind Spirit Soul Principle Life Truth Love

 Question  Are these terms synonymous
46512 Answer  They are They refer to one absolute God
 They are also intended to express the nature essence and
 wholeness of Deity The attributes of God are justice
46515 mercy wisdom goodness and so on

 Question  Is there more than one God or Principle
 Answer  There is not Principle and its idea is one
46518 and this one is God omnipotent omniscient and omni
4661 present Being and His reflection is man and the universe
 Omni is adopted from the Latin adjective signifying all
4663 Hence God combines allpower or potency allscience
 or true knowledge allpresence The varied manifesta
 tions of Christian Science indicate Mind never matter
4666 and have one Principle

 Real versus unreal

 Question  What are spirits and souls
 Answer  To human belief they are personalities
4669 constituted of mind and matter life and death truth and
 error good and evil but these contrasting
 pairs of terms represent contraries as Chris
46612 tian Science reveals which neither dwell together nor
 assimilate Truth is immortal error is mortal Truth
 is limitless error is limited Truth is intelligent error
46615 is nonintelligent Moreover Truth is real and error is
 unreal This last statement contains the point you will
 most reluctantly admit although first and last it is the
46618 most important to understand

 Mankind redeemed

 The term souls or spirits is as improper as the term
 gods Soul or Spirit signifies Deity and nothing else
46621 There is no finite soul nor spirit Soul or
 Spirit means only one Mind and cannot be
 rendered in the plural Heathen mythology and Jewish
46624 theology have perpetuated the fallacy that intelligence
 soul and life can be in matter and idolatry and ritualism
 are the outcome of all manmade beliefs The Science
46627 of Christianity comes with fan in hand to separate the
 chaff from the wheat Science will declare God aright
 and Christianity will demonstrate this declaration and
46630 its divine Principle making mankind better physically
 morally and spiritually

 Two chief commands

4671 Question  What are the demands of the Science of
 Soul
4673 Answer  The first demand of this Science is  Thou
 shalt have no other gods before me This me is Spirit
 Therefore the command means this Thou shalt
4676 have no intelligence no life no substance no
 truth no love but that which is spiritual The second
 is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
4679 It should be thoroughly understood that all men have one
 Mind one God and Father one Life Truth and Love
 Mankind will become perfect in proportion as this fact
46712 becomes apparent war will cease and the true brother
 hood of man will be established Having no other gods
 turning to no other but the one perfect Mind to guide
46715 him man is the likeness of God pure and eternal hav
 ing that Mind which was also in Christ

 Soul not confined in body

 Science reveals Spirit Soul as not in the body and
46718 God as not in man but as reflected by man The greater
 cannot be in the lesser The belief that the
 greater can be in the lesser is an error that
46721 works ill This is a leading point in the Science of Soul
 that Principle is not in its idea Spirit Soul is not
 confined in man and is never in matter We reason im
46724 perfectly from effect to cause when we conclude that
 matter is the effect of Spirit but a priori reasoning
 shows material existence to be enigmatical Spirit gives
46727 the true mental idea We cannot interpret Spirit Mind
 through matter Matter neither sees hears nor feels

 Sinlessness of Mind Soul

 Reasoning from cause to effect in the Science of Mind
46730 we begin with Mind which must be under
 stood through the idea which expresses it and
 cannot be learned from its opposite matter Thus we
4681 arrive at Truth or intelligence which evolves its own
 unerring idea and never can be coordinate with human
4683 illusions If Soul sinned it would be mortal for sin is
 mortalitys self because it kills itself If Truth is im
 mortal error must be mortal because error is unlike
4686 Truth Because Soul is immortal Soul cannot sin for
 sin is not the eternal verity of being

 Question  What is the scientific statement of being
4689 Answer  There is no life truth intelligence nor sub
 stance in matter All is infinite Mind and its infinite
 manifestation for God is Allinall Spirit is immortal
46812 Truth matter is mortal error Spirit is the real and
 eternal matter is the unreal and temporal Spirit is
 God and man is His image and likeness Therefore
46815 man is not material he is spiritual

 Spiritual synonyms

 Question  What is substance
 Answer  Substance is that which is eternal and inca
46818 pable of discord and decay Truth Life and Love are
 substance as the Scriptures use this word in
 Hebrews The substance of things hoped
46821 for the evidence of things not seen Spirit the synonym
 of Mind Soul or God is the only real substance The
 spiritual universe including individual man is a com
46824 pound idea reflecting the divine substance of Spirit

 Eternity of Life

 Question  What is Life
 Answer  Life is divine Principle Mind Soul Spirit
46827 Life is without beginning and without end
 Eternity not time expresses the thought of
 Life and time is no part of eternity One ceases in
46830 proportion as the other is recognized Time is finite
4691 eternity is forever infinite Life is neither in nor of mat
 ter What is termed matter is unknown to Spirit which
4693 includes in itself all substance and is Life eternal Mat
 ter is a human concept Life is divine Mind Life is not
 limited Death and finiteness are unknown to Life If
4696 Life ever had a beginning it would also have an ending

 Question  What is intelligence
 Answer  Intelligence is omniscience omnipresence
4699 and omnipotence It is the primal and eternal quality
 of infinite Mind of the triune Principle  Life Truth
 and Love  named God

 True sense of infinitude

46912 Question  What is Mind
 Answer  Mind is God The exterminator of error
 is the great truth that God good is the only Mind and
46915 that the supposititious opposite of infinite Mind
  called devil or evil  is not Mind is not
 Truth but error without intelligence or reality There
46918 can be but one Mind because there is but one God and
 if mortals claimed no other Mind and accepted no other
 sin would be unknown We can have but one Mind if
46921 that one is infinite We bury the sense of infinitude
 when we admit that although God is infinite evil has a
 place in this infinity for evil can have no place where all
46924 space is filled with God

 The sole governor

 We lose the high signification of omnipotence when
 after admitting that God or good is omnipresent and
46927 has allpower we still believe there is another
 power named evil This belief that there
 is more than one mind is as pernicious to divine theology
46930 as are ancient mythology and pagan idolatry With
4701 one Father even God the whole family of man would
 be brethren and with one Mind and that God or good
4703 the brotherhood of man would consist of Love and Truth
 and have unity of Principle and spiritual power which
 constitute divine Science The supposed existence of
4706 more than one mind was the basic error of idolatry This
 error assumed the loss of spiritual power the loss of the
 spiritual presence of Life as infinite Truth without an
4709 unlikeness and the loss of Love as ever present and
 universal

 The divine standard of perfection

 Divine Science explains the abstract statement that
47012 there is one Mind by the following selfevident propo
 sition If God or good is real then evil the
 unlikeness of God is unreal And evil can
47015 only seem to be real by giving reality to the
 unreal The children of God have but one Mind How
 can good lapse into evil when God the Mind of man
47018 never sins The standard of perfection was originally
 God and man Has God taken down His own standard
 and has man fallen

 Indestructible relationship

47021 God is the creator of man and the divine Principle
 of man remaining perfect the divine idea or reflection
 man remains perfect Man is the expression
47024 of Gods being If there ever was a moment
 when man did not express the divine perfec
 tion then there was a moment when man did not express
47027 God and consequently a time when Deity was unex
 pressed  that is without entity If man has lost per
 fection then he has lost his perfect Principle the divine
47030 Mind If man ever existed without this perfect Principle
 or Mind then mans existence was a myth

 The relations of God and man divine Principle and
4711 idea are indestructible in Science and Science knows
 no lapse from nor return to harmony but holds the divine
4713 order or spiritual law in which God and all that He cre
 ates are perfect and eternal to have remained unchanged
 in its eternal history

 Celestial evidence

4716 The unlikeness of Truth  named error  the op
 posite of Science and the evidence before the five cor
 poreal senses afford no indication of the grand
4719 facts of being even as these socalled senses
 receive no intimation of the earths motions or of the
 science of astronomy but yield assent to astronomical
47112 propositions on the authority of natural science

 The facts of divine Science should be admitted 
 although the evidence as to these facts is not supported
47115 by evil by matter or by material sense  because the
 evidence that God and man coexist is fully sustained by
 spiritual sense Man is and forever has been Gods re
47118 flection God is infinite therefore ever present and
 there is no other power nor presence Hence the spirit
 uality of the universe is the only fact of creation Let
47121 God be true but every material man a liar

 The test of experience

 Question  Are doctrines and creeds a benefit to man
 Answer  The author subscribed to an orthodox
47124 creed in early youth and tried to adhere to it until she
 caught the first gleam of that which inter
 prets God as above mortal sense This
47127 view rebuked human beliefs and gave the spiritual im
 port expressed through Science of all that proceeds
 from the divine Mind Since then her highest creed has
47130 been divine Science which reduced to human apprehen
 sion she has named Christian Science This Science
4721 teaches man that God is the only Life and that this Life
 is Truth and Love that God is to be understood adored
4723 and demonstrated that divine Truth casts out supposi
 tional error and heals the sick

 Gods law destroys evil

 The way which leads to Christian Science is straight
4726 and narrow God has set His signet upon Science mak
 ing it coordinate with all that is real and only
 with that which is harmonious and eternal
4729 Sickness sin and death being inharmonious do not
 originate in God nor belong to His government His
 law rightly understood destroys them Jesus furnished
47212 proofs of these statements

 Evanescent materiality

 Question  What is error
 Answer  Error is a supposition that pleasure and
47215 pain that intelligence substance life are existent in mat
 ter Error is neither Mind nor one of Minds
 faculties Error is the contradiction of Truth
47218 Error is a belief without understanding Error is unreal
 because untrue It is that which seemeth to be and is not
 If error were true its truth would be error and we should
47221 have a selfevident absurdity  namely erroneous truth
 Thus we should continue to lose the standard of Truth

 Unrealities that seem real

 Question  Is there no sin
47224 Answer  All reality is in God and His creation har
 monious and eternal That which He creates is good
 and He makes all that is made Therefore
47227 the only reality of sin sickness or death is
 the awful fact that unrealities seem real to human erring
 belief until God strips off their disguise They are not
47230 true because they are not of God We learn in Christian
4731 Science that all inharmony of mortal mind or body is illu
 sion possessing neither reality nor identity though seeming
4733 to be real and identical

 Christ the ideal Truth

 The Science of Mind disposes of all evil Truth God
 is not the father of error Sin sickness and death are
4736 to be classified as effects of error Christ
 came to destroy the belief of sin The God
 principle is omnipresent and omnipotent God is every
4739 where and nothing apart from Him is present or has
 power Christ is the ideal Truth that comes to heal
 sickness and sin through Christian Science and attributes
47312 all power to God Jesus is the name of the man who
 more than all other men has presented Christ the true
 idea of God healing the sick and the sinning and destroy
47315 ing the power of death Jesus is the human man and
 Christ is the divine idea hence the duality of Jesus the
 Christ

 Jesus not God

47318 In an age of ecclesiastical despotism Jesus introduced
 the teaching and practice of Christianity affording the
 proof of Christianitys truth and love but to
47321 reach his example and to test its unerring Sci
 ence according to his rule healing sickness sin and
 death a better understanding of God as divine Prin
47324 ciple Love rather than personality or the man Jesus is
 required

 Jesus not understood

 Jesus established what he said by demonstration
47327 thus making his acts of higher importance than his
 words He proved what he taught This
 is the Science of Christianity Jesus proved
47330 the Principle which heals the sick and casts out error
 to be divine Few however except his students un
 derstood in the least his teachings and their glorious
4741 proofs  namely that Life Truth and Love the Prin
 ciple of this unacknowledged Science destroy all error
4743 evil disease and death

 Miracles rejected

 The reception accorded to Truth in the early Chris
 tian era is repeated today Whoever introduces the
4746 Science of Christianity will be scoffed at and
 scourged with worse cords than those which
 cut the flesh To the ignorant age in which it first
4749 appears Science seems to be a mistake  hence the
 misinterpretation and consequent maltreatment which
 it receives Christian marvels and marvel is the sim
47412 ple meaning of the Greek word rendered miracle in the
 New Testament will be misunderstood and misused
 by many until the glorious Principle of these marvels is
47415 gained

 Divine fulfilment

 If sin sickness and death are as real as Life Truth
 and Love then they must all be from the same source
47418 God must be their author Now Jesus came
 to destroy sin sickness and death yet the
 Scriptures aver I am not come to destroy but to fulfil
47421 Is it possible then to believe that the evils which Jesus
 lived to destroy are real or the offspring of the divine
 will

 Truth destroys falsity

47424 Despite the hallowing influence of Truth in the de
 struction of error must error still be immortal Truth
 spares all that is true If evil is real Truth
47427 must make it so but error not Truth is
 the author of the unreal and the unreal vanishes
 while all that is real is eternal The apostle says that
47430 the mission of Christ is to destroy the works of the
 devil Truth destroys falsity and error for light and
 darkness cannot dwell together Light extinguishes the
4751 darkness and the Scripture declares that there is no
 night there To Truth there is no error  all is Truth
4753 To infinite Spirit there is no matter  all is Spirit divine
 Principle and its idea

 Fleshly factors unreal

 Question  What is man
4756 Answer  Man is not matter he is not made up of
 brain blood bones and other material elements The
 Scriptures inform us that man is made in
4759 the image and likeness of God Matter is
 not that likeness The likeness of Spirit cannot be so
 unlike Spirit Man is spiritual and perfect and be
47512 cause he is spiritual and perfect he must be so under
 stood in Christian Science Man is idea the image of
 Love he is not physique He is the compound idea of
47515 God including all right ideas the generic term for
 all that reflects Gods image and likeness the conscious
 identity of being as found in Science in which man is
47518 the reflection of God or Mind and therefore is eternal
 that which has no separate mind from God that which
 has not a single quality underived from Deity that which
47521 possesses no life intelligence nor creative power of his
 own but reflects spiritually all that belongs to his Maker

 And God said Let us make man in our image after
47524 our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish
 of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle
 and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that
47527 creepeth upon the earth

 Man unfallen

 Man is incapable of sin sickness and death The
 real man cannot depart from holiness nor
47530 can God by whom man is evolved engender
 the capacity or freedom to sin A mortal sinner is not
4761 Gods man Mortals are the counterfeits of immortals
 They are the children of the wicked one or the one evil
4763 which declares that man begins in dust or as a material
 embryo In divine Science God and the real man are
 inseparable as divine Principle and idea

 Mortals are not immortals

4766 Error urged to its final limits is selfdestroyed
 Error will cease to claim that soul is in body that life
 and intelligence are in matter and that
4769 this matter is man God is the Principle of
 man and man is the idea of God Hence man is not
 mortal nor material Mortals will disappear and im
47612 mortals or the children of God will appear as the only
 and eternal verities of man Mortals are not fallen chil
 dren of God They never had a perfect state of being
47615 which may subsequently be regained They were from
 the beginning of mortal history conceived in sin and
 brought forth in iniquity Mortality is finally swallowed
47618 up in immortality Sin sickness and death must dis
 appear to give place to the facts which belong to immortal
 man

 Imperishable identity

47621 Learn this O mortal and earnestly seek the spiritual
 status of man which is outside of all material selfhood
 Remember that the Scriptures say of mortal
47624 man As for man his days are as grass as
 a flower of the field so he flourisheth For the wind
 passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall
47627 know it no more

 The kingdom within

 When speaking of Gods children not the children of
 men Jesus said The kingdom of God is within you
47630 that is Truth and Love reign in the real
 man showing that man in Gods image is
 unfallen and eternal Jesus beheld in Science the per
4771 fect man who appeared to him where sinning mortal
 man appears to mortals In this perfect man the Saviour
4773 saw Gods own likeness and this correct view of man
 healed the sick Thus Jesus taught that the kingdom
 of God is intact universal and that man is pure and holy
4776 Man is not a material habitation for Soul he is himself
 spiritual Soul being Spirit is seen in nothing imperfect
 nor material

 Material body never Gods idea

4779 Whatever is material is mortal To the five corporeal
 senses man appears to be matter and mind united but
 Christian Science reveals man as the idea of
47712 God and declares the corporeal senses to be
 mortal and erring illusions Divine Science
 shows it to be impossible that a material body though
47715 interwoven with matters highest stratum misnamed
 mind should be man  the genuine and perfect man
 the immortal idea of being indestructible and eternal
47718 Were it otherwise man would be annihilated

 Reflection of Spirit

 Question  What are body and Soul
 Answer  Identity is the reflection of Spirit the re
47721 flection in multifarious forms of the living Principle
 Love Soul is the substance Life and intelli
 gence of man which is individualized but not
47724 in matter Soul can never reflect anything inferior to
 Spirit

 Man inseparable from Spirit

 Man is the expression of Soul The Indians caught
47727 some glimpses of the underlying reality when
 they called a certain beautiful lake the smile
 of the Great Spirit Separated from man
47730 who expresses Soul Spirit would be a nonentity man
 divorced from Spirit would lose his entity But there is
4781 there can be no such division for man is coexistent with
 God

 A vacant domicile

4783 What evidence of Soul or of immortality have you
 within mortality Even according to the teachings of
 natural science man has never beheld Spirit
4786 or Soul leaving a body or entering it What
 basis is there for the theory of indwelling spirit except
 the claim of mortal belief What would be thought of
4789 the declaration that a house was inhabited and by a cer
 tain class of persons when no such persons were ever seen
 to go into the house or to come out of it nor were they
47812 even visible through the windows Who can see a soul
 in the body

 Harmonious functions

 Question  Does brain think and do nerves feel and
47815 is there intelligence in matter
 Answer  No not if God is true and mortal man a
 liar The assertion that there can be pain or pleasure
47818 in matter is erroneous That body is most
 harmonious in which the discharge of the nat
 ural functions is least noticeable How can intelligence
47821 dwell in matter when matter is nonintelligent and
 brainlobes cannot think Matter cannot perform the
 functions of Mind Error says I am man but this
47824 belief is mortal and far from actual From beginning
 to end whatever is mortal is composed of material hu
 man beliefs and of nothing else That only is real which
47827 reflects God St Paul said But when it pleased God
 who separated me from my mothers womb and called me
 by His grace    I conferred not with flesh and blood

 Immortal birthright

47830 Mortal man is really a selfcontradictory phrase for
 man is not mortal neither indeed can be man is im
4791 mortal If a child is the offspring of physical sense and
 not of Soul the child must have a material not a spirit
4793 ual origin With what truth then could the
 Scriptural rejoicing be uttered by any mother
 I have gotten a man from the Lord On the con
4796 trary if aught comes from God it cannot be mortal and
 material it must be immortal and spiritual

 Matters supposed selfhood

 Matter is neither selfexistent nor a product of Spirit
4799 An image of mortal thought reflected on the retina is
 all that the eye beholds Matter cannot see
 feel hear taste nor smell It is not self
47912 cognizant  cannot feel itself see itself nor
 understand itself Take away socalled mortal mind
 which constitutes matters supposed selfhood and matter
47915 can take no cognizance of matter Does that which we
 call dead ever see hear feel or use any of the physical
 senses

 Chaos and darkness

47918 In the beginning God created the heaven and the
 earth And the earth was without form and void and
 darkness was upon the face of the deep
47921 Genesis i 1 2 In the vast forever in the
 Science and truth of being the only facts are Spirit
 and its innumerable creations Darkness and chaos
47924 are the imaginary opposites of light understanding
 and eternal harmony and they are the elements of
 nothingness

 Spiritual reflection

47927 We admit that black is not a color because it reflects
 no light So evil should be denied identity or power
 because it has none of the divine hues Paul
47930 says For the invisible things of Him from
 the creation of the world are clearly seen being under
 stood by the things that are made Romans i 20
4801 When the substance of Spirit appears in Christian Sci
 ence the nothingness of matter is recognized Where
4803 the spirit of God is and there is no place where God is
 not evil becomes nothing  the opposite of the some
 thing of Spirit If there is no spiritual reflection then
4806 there remains only the darkness of vacuity and not a trace
 of heavenly tints

 Harmony from Spirit

 Nerves are an element of the belief that there is sensa
4809 tion in matter whereas matter is devoid of sensation
 Consciousness as well as action is governed
 by Mind  is in God the origin and gov
48012 ernor of all that Science reveals Material sense has
 its realm apart from Science in the unreal Harmonious
 action proceeds from Spirit God inharmony has no
48015 Principle its action is erroneous and presupposes man
 to be in matter Inharmony would make matter the
 cause as well as the effect of intelligence or Soul thus
48018 attempting to separate Mind from God

 Evil nonexistent

 Man is not God and God is not man Again God
 or good never made man capable of sin It is the oppo
48021 site of good  that is evil  which seems to
 make men capable of wrongdoing Hence
 evil is but an illusion and it has no real basis Evil is a
48024 false belief God is not its author The supposititious
 parent of evil is a lie

 Vapor and nothingness

 The Bible declares All things were made by Him
48027 the divine Word and without Him was not anything
 made that was made This is the eternal
 verity of divine Science If sin sickness
48030 death were understood as nothingness they would dis
 appear As vapor melts before the sun so evil would
 vanish before the reality of good One must hide the
4811 other How important then to choose good as the
 reality Man is tributary to God Spirit and to nothing
4813 else Gods being is infinity freedom harmony and
 boundless bliss Where the Spirit of the Lord is
 there is liberty Like the archpriests of yore man is
4816 free to enter into the holiest  the realm of God

 The fruit forbidden

 Material sense never helps mortals to understand
 Spirit God Through spiritual sense only man com
4819 prehends and loves Deity The various con
 tradictions of the Science of Mind by the ma
 terial senses do not change the unseen Truth which re
48112 mains forever intact The forbidden fruit of knowledge
 against which wisdom warns man is the testimony of
 error declaring existence to be at the mercy of death
48115 and good and evil to be capable of commingling This
 is the significance of the Scripture concerning this tree
 of the knowledge of good and evil  this growth of
48118 material belief of which it is said In the day that thou
 eatest thereof thou shalt surely die Human hypotheses
 first assume the reality of sickness sin and death and
48121 then assume the necessity of these evils because of their
 admitted actuality These human verdicts are the pro
 curers of all discord

 Sense and pure Soul

48124 If Soul sins it must be mortal Sin has the elements
 of selfdestruction It cannot sustain itself If sin is
 supported God must uphold it and this is
48127 impossible since Truth cannot support error
 Soul is the divine Principle of man and never sins 
 hence the immortality of Soul In Science we learn that
48130 it is material sense not Soul which sins and it will be
 found that it is the sense of sin which is lost and not a
 sinful soul When reading the Scriptures the substitu
4821 tion of the word sense for soul gives the exact meaning in
 a majority of cases

 Soul defined

4823 Human thought has adulterated the meaning of the
 word soul through the hypothesis that soul is both an evil
 and a good intelligence resident in matter
4826 The proper use of the word soul can always
 be gained by substituting the word God where the deific
 meaning is required In other cases use the word sense
4829 and you will have the scientific signification As used
 in Christian Science Soul is properly the synonym of
 Spirit or God but out of Science soul is identical with
48212 sense with material sensation

 Sonship of Jesus

 Question  Is it important to understand these ex
 planations in order to heal the sick
48215 Answer  It is since Christ is the way and the
 truth casting out all error Jesus called himself  the
 Son of man but not the son of Joseph As
48218 woman is but a species of the genera he was
 literally the Son of Man Jesus was the highest human
 concept of the perfect man He was inseparable from
48221 Christ the Messiah  the divine idea of God outside
 the flesh This enabled Jesus to demonstrate his con
 trol over matter Angels announced to the Wisemen of
48224 old this dual appearing and angels whisper it through
 faith to the hungering heart in every age

 Sickness erroneous

 Sickness is part of the error which Truth casts out
48227 Error will not expel error Christian Science is the law
 of Truth which heals the sick on the basis
 of the one Mind or God It can heal in no
48230 other way since the human mortal mind socalled is not
 a healer but causes the belief in disease

 True healing transcendent

4831 Then comes the question how do drugs hygiene and
 animal magnetism heal It may be affirmed that they
4833 do not heal but only relieve suffering tempo
 rarily exchanging one disease for another
 We classify disease as error which nothing but Truth or
4836 Mind can heal and this Mind must be divine not human
 Mind transcends all other power and will ultimately su
 persede all other means in healing In order to heal by
4839 Science you must not be ignorant of the moral and spir
 itual demands of Science nor disobey them Moral igno
 rance or sin affects your demonstration and hinders its
48312 approach to the standard in Christian Science

 Terms adopted by the author

 After the authors sacred discovery she affixed the
 name Science to Christianity the name error to
48315 corporeal sense and the name substance to
 Mind Science has called the world to battle
 over this issue and its demonstration which
48318 heals the sick destroys error and reveals the universal
 harmony To those natural Christian Scientists the an
 cient worthies and to Christ Jesus God certainly revealed
48321 the spirit of Christian Science if not the absolute letter

 Science the way

 Because the Science of Mind seems to bring into dis
 honor the ordinary scientific schools which wrestle with
48324 material observations alone this Science has
 met with opposition but if any system honors
 God it ought to receive aid not opposition from all think
48327 ing persons And Christian Science does honor God as
 no other theory honors Him and it does this in the way
 of His appointing by doing many wonderful works
48330 through the divine name and nature One must fulfil
 ones mission without timidity or dissimulation for to be
 well done the work must be done unselfishly Christianity
4841 will never be based on a divine Principle and so found to
 be unerring until its absolute Science is reached When
4843 this is accomplished neither pride prejudice bigotry
 nor envy can wash away its foundation for it is built upon
 the rock Christ

 Mindless methods

4846 Question  Does Christian Science or metaphysical
 healing include medication material hygiene mesmer
 ism hypnotism theosophy or spiritualism
4849 Answer  Not one of them is included in it In di
 vine Science the supposed laws of matter yield to the
 law of Mind What are termed natural
48412 science and material laws are the objective
 states of mortal mind The physical universe expresses
 the conscious and unconscious thoughts of mortals
48415 Physical force and mortal mind are one Drugs and
 hygiene oppose the supremacy of the divine Mind
 Drugs and inert matter are unconscious mindless Cer
48418 tain results supposed to proceed from drugs are really
 caused by the faith in them which the false human con
 sciousness is educated to feel

 Animal magnetism error

48421 Mesmerism is mortal material illusion Animal mag
 netism is the voluntary or involuntary action of error
 in all its forms it is the human antipode
48424 of divine Science Science must triumph
 over material sense and Truth over error thus putting
 an end to the hypotheses involved in all false theories
48427 and practices

 Error only ephemeral

 Question  Is materiality the concomitant of spirit
 uality and is material sense a necessary preliminary to
48430 the understanding and expression of Spirit
4851 Answer  If error is necessary to define or to reveal
 Truth the answer is yes but not otherwise Material
4853 sense is an absurd phrase for matter has no
 sensation Science declares that Mind not
 matter sees hears feels speaks Whatever contradicts
4856 this statement is the false sense which ever betrays
 mortals into sickness sin and death If the unimpor
 tant and evil appear only soon to disappear because
4859 of their uselessness or their iniquity then these ephem
 eral views of error ought to be obliterated by Truth
 Why malign Christian Science for instructing mortals how
48512 to make sin disease and death appear more and more
 unreal

 Scientific translations

 Emerge gently from matter into Spirit Think not
48515 to thwart the spiritual ultimate of all things but come
 naturally into Spirit through better health and
 morals and as the result of spiritual growth
48518 Not death but the understanding of Life makes man im
 mortal The belief that life can be in matter or soul in
 body and that man springs from dust or from an egg
48521 is the result of the mortal error which Christ or Truth
 destroys by fulfilling the spiritual law of being in which
 man is perfect even as the Father which is in heaven
48524 is perfect If thought yields its dominion to other 
 powers it cannot outline on the body its own beautiful
 images but it effaces them and delineates foreign agents
48527 called disease and sin

 Material beliefs

 The heathen gods of mythology controlled war and
 agriculture as much as nerves control sensation or
48530 muscles measure strength To say that
 strength is in matter is like saying that the
 power is in the lever The notion of any life or intelli
4861 gence in matter is without foundation in fact and you
 can have no faith in falsehood when you have learned
4863 falsehoods true nature

 Sense versus Soul

 Suppose one accident happens to the eye another to
 the ear and so on until every corporeal sense is quenched
4866 What is mans remedy To die that he may
 regain these senses Even then he must gain
 spiritual understanding and spiritual sense in order to
4869 possess immortal consciousness Earths preparatory
 school must be improved to the utmost In reality man
 never dies The belief that he dies will not establish his
48612 scientific harmony Death is not the result of Truth but
 of error and one error will not correct another

 Death an error

 Jesus proved by the prints of the nails that his body
48615 was the same immediately after death as before If death
 restores sight sound and strength to man
 then death is not an enemy but a better friend
48618 than Life Alas for the blindness of belief which makes
 harmony conditional upon death and matter and yet
 supposes Mind unable to produce harmony So long
48621 as this error of belief remains mortals will continue mor
 tal in belief and subject to chance and change

 Permanent sensibility

 Sight hearing all the spiritual senses of man are
48624 eternal They cannot be lost Their reality and immor
 tality are in Spirit and understanding not in
 matter  hence their permanence If this
48627 were not so man would be speedily annihilated If the
 five corporeal senses were the medium through which
 to understand God then palsy blindness and deafness
48630 would place man in a terrible situation where he would
 be like those having no hope and without God in the
 world but as a matter of fact these calamities often
4871 drive mortals to seek and to find a higher sense of happi
 ness and existence

 Exercise of Mindfaculties

4873 Life is deathless Life is the origin and ultimate of
 man never attainable through death but gained by walk
 ing in the pathway of Truth both before and
4876 after that which is called death There is more
 Christianity in seeing and hearing spiritually
 than materially There is more Science in the perpetual
4879 exercise of the Mindfaculties than in their loss Lost
 they cannot be while Mind remains The apprehension
 of this gave sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf cen
48712 turies ago and it will repeat the wonder

 Understanding versus belief

 Question  You speak of belief Who or what is it
 that believes
48715 Answer  Spirit is allknowing this precludes the
 need of believing Matter cannot believe and Mind
 understands The body cannot believe The
48718 believer and belief are one and are mortal
 Christian evidence is founded on Science or
 demonstrable Truth flowing from immortal Mind and
48721 there is in reality no such thing as mortal mind Mere
 belief is blindness without Principle from which to ex
 plain the reason of its hope The belief that life is sen
48724 tient and intelligent matter is erroneous

 The Apostle James said Show me thy faith without
 thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works
48727 The understanding that Life is God Spirit lengthens
 our days by strengthening our trust in the deathless
 reality of Life its almightiness and immortality

 Confirmation by healing

48730 This faith relies upon an understood Principle This
 Principle makes whole the diseased and brings out the
4881 enduring and harmonious phases of things The result
 of our teachings is their sufficient confirmation When
4883 on the strength of these instructions you are
 able to banish a severe malady the cure shows
 that you understand this teaching and therefore you re
4886 ceive the blessing of Truth

 Belief and firm trust

 The Hebrew and Greek words often translated belief
 differ somewhat in meaning from that conveyed by the
4889 English verb believe they have more the sig
 nificance of faith understanding trust con
 stancy firmness Hence the Scriptures often appear in
48812 our common version to approve and endorse belief when
 they mean to enforce the necessity of understanding

 All faculties from Mind

 Question  Do the five corporeal senses constitute
48815 man
 Answer  Christian Science sustains with immortal
 proof the impossibility of any material sense and defines
48818 these socalled senses as mortal beliefs the
 testimony of which cannot be true either of
 man or of his Maker The corporeal senses can take no
48821 cognizance of spiritual reality and immortality Nerves
 have no more sensation apart from what belief be
 stows upon them than the fibres of a plant Mind alone
48824 possesses all faculties perception and comprehension
 Therefore mental endowments are not at the mercy of
 organization and decomposition  otherwise the very
48827 worms could unfashion man If it were possible for the
 real senses of man to be injured Soul could reproduce
 them in all their perfection but they cannot be dis
48830 turbed nor destroyed since they exist in immortal Mind
 not in matter

 Possibilities of Life

4891 The less mind there is manifested in matter the better
 When the unthinking lobster loses its claw the claw grows
4893 again If the Science of Life were understood
 it would be found that the senses of Mind are
 never lost and that matter has no sensation Then the
4896 human limb would be replaced as readily as the lobsters
 claw  not with an artificial limb but with the genuine
 one Any hypothesis which supposes life to be in matter
4899 is an educated belief In infancy this belief is not equal
 to guiding the hand to the mouth and as consciousness
 develops this belief goes out  yields to the reality of
48912 everlasting Life

 Decalogue disregarded

 Corporeal sense defrauds and lies it breaks all the
 commands of the Mosaic Decalogue to meet its own de
48915 mands How then can this sense be the God
 given channel to man of divine blessings or
 understanding How can man reflecting God be de
48918 pendent on material means for knowing hearing seeing
 Who dares to say that the senses of man can be at one time
 the medium for sinning against God at another the me
48921 dium for obeying God An affirmative reply would con
 tradict the Scripture for the same fountain sendeth not
 forth sweet waters and bitter

 Organic construction valueless

48924 The corporeal senses are the only source of evil or
 error Christian Science shows them to be false be
 cause matter has no sensation and no organic
48927 construction can give it hearing and sight nor
 make it the medium of Mind Outside the
 material sense of things all is harmony A wrong sense
48930 of God man and creation is nonsense want of sense
 Mortal belief would have the material senses sometimes
 good and sometimes bad It assures mortals that there
4901 is real pleasure in sin but the grand truths of Christian
 Science dispute this error

 Willpower an animal propensity

4903 Willpower is but a product of belief and this belief
 commits depredations on harmony Human will is an
 animal propensity not a faculty of Soul
4906 Hence it cannot govern man aright Chris
 tian Science reveals Truth and Love as the
 motivepowers of man Will  blind stubborn and head
4909 long  cooperates with appetite and passion From this
 cooperation arises its evil From this also comes its pow
 erlessness since all power belongs to God good

 Theories helpless

49012 The Science of Mind needs to be understood Until
 it is understood mortals are more or less deprived of
 Truth Human theories are helpless to make
49015 man harmonious or immortal since he is so
 already according to Christian Science Our only need
 is to know this and reduce to practice the real mans di
49018 vine Principle Love

 True nature and origin

 Quench not the Spirit Despise not prophesyings
 Human belief  or knowledge gained from the socalled
49021 material senses  would by fair logic anni
 hilate man along with the dissolving elements
 of clay The scientifically Christian explanations of the
49024 nature and origin of man destroy all material sense with
 immortal testimony This immortal testimony ushers
 in the spiritual sense of being which can be obtained
49027 in no other way

 Sleep an illusion

 Sleep and mesmerism explain the mythical nature of
 material sense Sleep shows material sense as either
49030 oblivion nothingness or an illusion or dream
 Under the mesmeric illusion of belief a man
 will think that he is freezing when he is warm and that he
4911 is swimming when he is on dry land Needlethrusts will
 not hurt him A delicious perfume will seem intolerable
4913 Animal magnetism thus uncovers material sense and
 shows it to be a belief without actual foundation or va
 lidity Change the belief and the sensation changes
4916 Destroy the belief and the sensation disappears

 Man linked with Spirit

 Material man is made up of involuntary and voluntary
 error of a negative right and a positive wrong the latter
4919 calling itself right Mans spiritual individual
 ity is never wrong It is the likeness of mans
 Maker Matter cannot connect mortals with the true
49112 origin and facts of being in which all must end It is only
 by acknowledging the supremacy of Spirit which annuls
 the claims of matter that mortals can lay off mortality and
49115 find the indissoluble spiritual link which establishes man
 forever in the divine likeness inseparable from his creator

 Material man as a dream

 The belief that matter and mind are one  that mat
49118 ter is awake at one time and asleep at another some
 times presenting no appearance of mind 
 this belief culminates in another belief that
49121 man dies Science reveals material man as never the real
 being The dream or belief goes on whether our eyes are
 closed or open In sleep memory and consciousness are
49124 lost from the body and they wander whither they will
 apparently with their own separate embodiment Per
 sonality is not the individuality of man A wicked man
49127 may have an attractive personality

 Spiritual existence the one fact

 When we are awake we dream of the pains and pleas
 ures of matter Who will say even though he
49130 does not understand Christian Science that
 this dream  rather than the dreamer  may
 not be mortal man Who can rationally say otherwise
4921 when the dream leaves mortal man intact in body and
 thought although the socalled dreamer is unconscious
4923 For right reasoning there should be but one fact before
 the thought namely spiritual existence In reality there
 is no other existence since Life cannot be united to its
4926 unlikeness mortality

 Mind one and all

 Being is holiness harmony immortality It is already
 proved that a knowledge of this even in small degree
4929 will uplift the physical and moral standard
 of mortals will increase longevity will purify
 and elevate character Thus progress will finally destroy
49212 all error and bring immortality to light We know that
 a statement proved to be good must be correct New
 thoughts are constantly obtaining the floor These two
49215 contradictory theories  that matter is something or
 that all is Mind  will dispute the ground until one is
 acknowledged to be the victor Discussing his cam
49218 paign General Grant said I propose to fight it out on
 this line if it takes all summer Science says All is
 Mind and Minds idea You must fight it out on this
49221 line Matter can afford you no aid

 Scientific ultimatum

 The notion that mind and matter commingle in the
 human illusion as to sin sickness and death must even
49224 tually submit to the Science of Mind which
 denies this notion God is Mind and God is
 infinite hence all is Mind On this statement rests the
49227 Science of being and the Principle of this Science is di
 vine demonstrating harmony and immortality

 Victory for Truth

 The conservative theory long believed is that there
49230 are two factors matter and mind uniting on some im
 possible basis This theory would keep truth and error
 always at war Victory would perch on neither banner
4931 On the other hand Christian Science speedily shows
 Truth to be triumphant To corporeal sense the sun
4933 appears to rise and set and the earth to stand
 still but astronomical science contradicts this
 and explains the solar system as working on a differ
4936 ent plan All the evidence of physical sense and all the
 knowledge obtained from physical sense must yield to
 Science to the immortal truth of all things

 Mental preparation

4939 Question  Will you explain sickness and show how it
 is to be healed
 Answer  The method of Christian Science Mindheal
49312 ing is touched upon in a previous chapter entitled Christian
 Science Practice A full answer to the above
 question involves teaching which enables the
49315 healer to demonstrate and prove for himself the Principle
 and rule of Christian Science or metaphysical healing

 Mind destroys all ills

 Mind must be found superior to all the beliefs of the
49318 five corporeal senses and able to destroy all ills Sick
 ness is a belief which must be annihilated by
 the divine Mind Disease is an experience of
49321 socalled mortal mind It is fear made manifest on the
 body Christian Science takes away this physical sense
 of discord just as it removes any other sense of moral or
49324 mental inharmony That man is material and that mat
 ter suffers  these propositions can only seem real and
 natural in illusion Any sense of soul in matter is not the
49327 reality of being

 If Jesus awakened Lazarus from the dream illusion of
 death this proved that the Christ could improve on a false
49330 sense Who dares to doubt this consummate test of the
 power and willingness of divine Mind to hold man forever
4941 intact in his perfect state and to govern mans entire
 action Jesus said Destroy this temple body and
4943 in three days I Mind will raise it up and he did this
 for tired humanitys reassurance

 Inexhaustible divine Love

 Is it not a species of infidelity to believe that so great
4946 a work as the Messiahs was done for himself or for God
 who needed no help from Jesus example to
 preserve the eternal harmony But mortals
4949 did need this help and Jesus pointed the way for them
 Divine Love always has met and always will meet every
 human need It is not well to imagine that Jesus demon
49412 strated the divine power to heal only for a select number
 or for a limited period of time since to all mankind and
 in every hour divine Love supplies all good

 Reason and Science

49415 The miracle of grace is no miracle to Love Jesus
 demonstrated the inability of corporeality as well as the
 infinite ability of Spirit thus helping erring
49418 human sense to flee from its own convictions
 and seek safety in divine Science Reason rightly di
 rected serves to correct the errors of corporeal sense but
49421 sin sickness and death will seem real even as the ex
 periences of the sleeping dream seem real until the Sci
 ence of mans eternal harmony breaks their illusion with
49424 the unbroken reality of scientific being

 Which of these two theories concerning man are you
 ready to accept One is the mortal testimony changing
49427 dying unreal The other is the eternal and real evidence
 bearing Truths signet its lap piled high with immortal
 fruits

 Followers of Jesus

49430 Our Master cast out devils evils and healed the sick
 It should be said of his followers also that they cast fear
 and all evil out of themselves and others and heal the sick
4951 God will heal the sick through man whenever man is
 governed by God Truth casts out error now
4953 as surely as it did nineteen centuries ago All
 of Truth is not understood hence its healing power is not
 fully demonstrated

 Destruction of all evil

4956 If sickness is true or the idea of Truth you cannot
 destroy sickness and it would be absurd to try Then
 classify sickness and error as our Master did
4959 when he spoke of the sick whom Satan hath
 bound and find a sovereign antidote for error in the life
 giving power of Truth acting on human belief a power
49512 which opens the prison doors to such as are bound and
 sets the captive free physically and morally

 Steadfast and calm trust

 When the illusion of sickness or sin tempts you cling
49515 steadfastly to God and His idea Allow nothing but His
 likeness to abide in your thought Let neither
 fear nor doubt overshadow your clear sense and
49518 calm trust that the recognition of life harmonious  as
 Life eternally is  can destroy any painful sense of or
 belief in that which Life is not Let Christian Science
49521 instead of corporeal sense support your understanding of
 being and this understanding will supplant error with
 Truth replace mortality with immortality and silence dis
49524 cord with harmony

 Rudiments and growth

 Question  How can I progress most rapidly in the
 understanding of Christian Science
49527 Answer  Study thoroughly the letter and imbibe
 the spirit Adhere to the divine Principle of Chris
 tian Science and follow the behests of God
49530 abiding steadfastly in wisdom Truth and
 Love In the Science of Mind you will soon ascertain
4961 that error cannot destroy error You will also learn
 that in Science there is no transfer of evil suggestions
4963 from one mortal to another for there is but one Mind
 and this everpresent omnipotent Mind is reflected by
 man and governs the entire universe You will learn
4966 that in Christian Science the first duty is to obey
 God to have one Mind and to love another as
 yourself

 Condition of progress

4969 We all must learn that Life is God Ask yourself
 Am I living the life that approaches the supreme good
 Am I demonstrating the healing power of
49612 Truth and Love If so then the way will
 grow brighter unto the perfect day Your fruits
 will prove what the understanding of God brings to man
49615 Hold perpetually this thought  that it is the spiritual
 idea the Holy Ghost and Christ which enables you to
 demonstrate with scientific certainty the rule of healing
49618 based upon its divine Principle Love underlying over
 lying and encompassing all true being

 Triumph over death

 The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is
49621 the law  the law of mortal belief at war with the
 facts of immortal Life even with the spiritual
 law which says to the grave Where is thy
49624 victory But when this corruptible shall have put
 on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on im
 mortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that
49627 is written Death is swallowed up in victory

 Question  Have Christian Scientists any religious
 creed
49630 Answer  They have not if by that term is meant
 doctrinal beliefs The following is a brief exposition of
4971 the important points or religious tenets of Christian
 Science 

4973 1 As adherents of Truth we take the inspired Word
 of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life

 2 We acknowledge and adore one supreme and in
4976 finite God We acknowledge His Son one Christ the
 Holy Ghost or divine Comforter and man in Gods
 image and likeness

4979 3 We acknowledge Gods forgiveness of sin in the
 destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that
 casts out evil as unreal But the belief in sin is pun
49712 ished so long as the belief lasts

 4 We acknowledge Jesus atonement as the evi
 dence of divine efficacious Love unfolding mans unity
49715 with God through Christ Jesus the Wayshower and
 we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ
 through Truth Life and Love as demonstrated by the
49718 Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming
 sin and death

 5 We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and
49721 his resurrection served to uplift faith to understand eter
 nal Life even the allness of Soul Spirit and the noth
 ingness of matter

49724 6 And we solemnly promise to watch and pray for
 that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus to
 do unto others as we would have them do unto us and
49727 to be merciful just and pure







 KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES

 These things saith He that is holy He that is true He that
 hath the key of David He that openeth and no man shutteth
 and shutteth and no man openeth I know thy works behold
 I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it
  REVELATION




 CHAPTER XV  GENESIS

 And I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the
 name of God Almighty but by My name Jehovah was I not known to
 them  EXODUS

 All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything
 made that was made In Him was life and the life was the light
 of men  JOHN

 Spiritual interpretation

5011 SCIENTIFIC interpretation of the Scriptures prop
 erly starts with the beginning of the Old Testa
5013 ment chiefly because the spiritual import of
 the Word in its earliest articulations often
 seems so smothered by the immediate context as to
5016 require explication whereas the New Testament narra
 tives are clearer and come nearer the heart Jesus il
 lumines them showing the poverty of mortal existence
5019 but richly recompensing human want and woe with
 spiritual gain The incarnation of Truth that amplifi
 cation of wonder and glory which angels could only
50112 whisper and which God illustrated by light and har
 mony is consonant with everpresent Love Socalled
 mystery and miracle which subserve the end of natural
50115 good are explained by that Love for whose rest the
 weary ones sigh when needing something more native
 to their immortal cravings than the history of perpetual
50118 evil

 Spiritual overture

5021 A second necessity for beginning with Genesis is that
 the living and real prelude of the older Scriptures is so
5023 brief that it would almost seem from the
 preponderance of unreality in the entire nar
 rative as if reality did not predominate over unreality
5026 the light over the dark the straight line of Spirit over
 the mortal deviations and inverted images of the creator
 and His creation

 Deflection of being

5029 Spiritually followed the book of Genesis is the history
 of the untrue image of God named a sinful mortal This
 deflection of being rightly viewed serves to
50212 suggest the proper reflection of God and the
 spiritual actuality of man as given in the first chapter
 of Genesis Even thus the crude forms of human thought
50215 take on higher symbols and significations when scien
 tifically Christian views of the universe appear illuminat
 ing time with the glory of eternity

50218 In the following exegesis each text is followed by its
 spiritual interpretation according to the teachings of Chris
 tian Science

50221 EXEGESIS

 Genesis i 1 In the beginning God created the heaven
 and the earth

 Ideas and identities

50224 The infinite has no beginning This word beginning
 is employed to signify the only  that is the eternal ver
 ity and unity of God and man including
50227 the universe The creative Principle  Life
 Truth and Love  is God The universe reflects God
 There is but one creator and one creation This crea
5031 tion consists of the unfolding of spiritual ideas and their
 identities which are embraced in the infinite Mind and
5033 forever reflected These ideas range from the infini
 tesimal to infinity and the highest ideas are the sons
 and daughters of God

5036 Genesis i 2 And the earth was without form and void
 and darkness was upon the face of the deep And the
 spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters

 Spiritual harmony

5039 The divine Principle and idea constitute spiritual har
 mony  heaven and eternity In the universe of Truth
 matter is unknown No supposition of error
50312 enters there Divine Science the Word of
 God saith to the darkness upon the face of error God
 is Allinall and the light of everpresent Love illumines
50315 the universe Hence the eternal wonder  that infinite
 space is peopled with Gods ideas reflecting Him in
 countless spiritual forms

50318 Genesis i 3 And God said Let there be light and
 there was light

 Minds idea faultless

 Immortal and divine Mind presents the idea of God
50321 first in light second in reflection third in spiritual and
 immortal forms of beauty and goodness But
 this Mind creates no element nor symbol of
50324 discord and decay God creates neither erring thought
 mortal life mutable truth nor variable love

 Genesis i 4 And God saw the light that it was good
50327 and God divided the light from the darkness

 God Spirit dwelling in infinite light and harmony
5041 from which emanates the true idea is never reflected by
 aught but the good

5043 Genesis i 5 And God called the light Day and the
 darkness He called Night And the evening and the morn
 ing were the first day

 Light preceding the sun

5046 All questions as to the divine creation being both
 spiritual and material are answered in this passage for
 though solar beams are not yet included in
5049 the record of creation still there is light This
 light is not from the sun nor from volcanic flames but it
 is the revelation of Truth and of spiritual ideas This
50412 also shows that there is no place where Gods light is not
 seen since Truth Life and Love fill immensity and are
 everpresent Was not this a revelation instead of a
50415 creation

 Evenings and mornings

 The successive appearing of Gods ideas is represented
 as taking place on so many evenings and mornings 
50418 words which indicate in the absence of solar
 time spiritually clearer views of Him views
 which are not implied by material darkness and dawn
50421 Here we have the explanation of another passage of
 Scripture that one day is with the Lord as a thousand
 years The rays of infinite Truth when gathered into
50424 the focus of ideas bring light instantaneously whereas
 a thousand years of human doctrines hypotheses and
 vague conjectures emit no such effulgence

 Spirit versus darkness

50427 Did infinite Mind create matter and call it light
 Spirit is light and the contradiction of Spirit is matter
 darkness and darkness obscures light Mate
50430 rial sense is nothing but a supposition of the
 absence of Spirit No solar rays nor planetary revolutions
5051 form the day of Spirit Immortal Mind makes its own
 record but mortal mind sleep dreams sin disease and
5053 death have no record in the first chapter of Genesis

 Genesis i 6 And God said Let there be a firmament in
 the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from
5056 the waters

 Spiritual firmament

 Spiritual understanding by which human conception
 material sense is separated from Truth is the firmament
5059 The divine Mind not matter creates all iden
 tities and they are forms of Mind the ideas of
 Spirit apparent only as Mind never as mindless matter
50512 nor the socalled material senses

 Genesis i 7 And God made the firmament and divided
 the waters which were under the firmament from the waters
50515 which were above the firmament and it was so

 Understanding imparted

 Spirit imparts the understanding which uplifts con
 sciousness and leads into all truth The Psalmist saith
50518 The Lord on high is mightier than the noise
 of many waters yea than the mighty waves of
 the sea Spiritual sense is the discernment of spiritual
50521 good Understanding is the line of demarcation between
 the real and unreal Spiritual understanding unfolds
 Mind  Life Truth and Love  and demonstrates the
50524 divine sense giving the spiritual proof of the universe in
 Christian Science

 Original reflected

 This understanding is not intellectual is not the result
50527 of scholarly attainments it is the reality of all things
 brought to light Gods ideas reflect the im
 mortal unerring and infinite The mortal
50530 erring and finite are human beliefs which apportion to
5061 themselves a task impossible for them that of distinguish
 ing between the false and the true Objects utterly un
5063 like the original do not reflect that original Therefore
 matter not being the reflection of Spirit has no real en
 tity Understanding is a quality of God a quality which
5066 separates Christian Science from supposition and makes
 Truth final

 Genesis i 8 And God called the firmament Heaven
5069 And the evening and the morning were the second day

 Exalted thought

 Through divine Science Spirit God unites under
 standing to eternal harmony The calm and exalted
50612 thought or spiritual apprehension is at peace
 Thus the dawn of ideas goes on forming each
 successive stage of progress

50615 Genesis i 9 And God said Let the waters under the
 heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry
 land appear and it was so

 Unfolding of thoughts

50618 Spirit God gathers unformed thoughts into their
 proper channels and unfolds these thoughts
 even as He opens the petals of a holy purpose
50621 in order that the purpose may appear

 Genesis i 10 And God called the dry land Earth and
 the gathering together of the waters called He Seas and
50624 God saw that it was good

 Spirit names and blesses

 Here the human concept and divine idea seem con
 fused by the translator but they are not so in the scien
50627 tifically Christian meaning of the text Upon
 Adam devolved the pleasurable task of find
 ing names for all material things but Adam has not yet
5071 appeared in the narrative In metaphor the dry land
 illustrates the absolute formations instituted by Mind
5073 while water symbolizes the elements of Mind Spirit duly
 feeds and clothes every object as it appears in the line
 of spiritual creation thus tenderly expressing the father
5076 hood and motherhood of God Spirit names and blesses
 all Without natures particularly defined objects and
 subjects would be obscure and creation would be full of
5079 nameless offspring  wanderers from the parent Mind
 strangers in a tangled wilderness

 Genesis i 11 And God said Let the earth bring forth
50712 grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding
 fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth
 and it was so

 Divine propagation

50715 The universe of Spirit reflects the creative power of
 the divine Principle or Life which reproduces the multi
 tudinous forms of Mind and governs the mul
50718 tiplication of the compound idea man The
 tree and herb do not yield fruit because of any propagat
 ing power of their own but because they reflect the Mind
50721 which includes all A material world implies a mortal
 mind and man a creator The scientific divine creation
 declares immortal Mind and the universe created by God

 Everappearing creation

50724 Infinite Mind creates and governs all from the men
 tal molecule to infinity This divine Principle of all
 expresses Science and art throughout His
50727 creation and the immortality of man and the
 universe Creation is ever appearing and must ever con
 tinue to appear from the nature of its inexhaustible source
50730 Mortal sense inverts this appearing and calls ideas mate
 rial Thus misinterpreted the divine idea seems to fall
5081 to the level of a human or material belief called mortal
 man But the seed is in itself only as the divine Mind
5083 is All and reproduces all  as Mind is the multiplier
 and Minds infinite idea man and the universe is the
 product The only intelligence or substance of a thought
5086 a seed or a flower is God the creator of it Mind is the
 Soul of all Mind is Life Truth and Love which gov
 erns all

5089 Genesis i 12 And the earth brought forth grass and
 herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding
 fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw
50812 that it was good

 Minds pure thought

 God determines the gender of His own ideas Gen
 der is mental not material The seed within itself is
50815 the pure thought emanating from divine
 Mind The feminine gender is not yet ex
 pressed in the text Gender means simply kind or sort
50818 and does not necessarily refer either to masculinity or
 femininity The word is not confined to sexuality and
 grammars always recognize a neuter gender neither
50821 male nor female The Mind or intelligence of produc
 tion names the female gender last in the ascending order
 of creation The intelligent individual idea be it male
50824 or female rising from the lesser to the greater unfolds
 the infinitude of Love

 Genesis i 13 And the evening and the morning were
50827 the third day

 Rising to the light

 The third stage in the order of Christian Science is an
 important one to the human thought letting in the light
5091 of spiritual understanding This period corresponds to
 the resurrection when Spirit is discerned to be the Life of
5093 all and the deathless Life or Mind dependent
 upon no material organization Our Master
 reappeared to his students  to their apprehension he
5096 rose from the grave  on the third day of his ascending
 thought and so presented to them the certain sense of
 eternal Life

5099 Genesis i 14 And God said Let there be lights in the
 firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night
 and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days
50912 and years

 Rarefaction of thought

 Spirit creates no other than heavenly or celestial bodies
 but the stellar universe is no more celestial than our earth
50915 This text gives the idea of the rarefaction of
 thought as it ascends higher God forms and
 peoples the universe The light of spiritual understand
50918 ing gives gleams of the infinite only even as nebulae indi
 cate the immensity of space

 Divine nature appearing

 Socalled mineral vegetable and animal substances
50921 are no more contingent now on time or material struc
 ture than they were when the morning stars
 sang together Mind made the plant of
50924 the field before it was in the earth The periods of
 spiritual ascension are the days and seasons of Minds
 creation in which beauty sublimity purity and holiness
50927  yea the divine nature  appear in man and the uni
 verse never to disappear

 Spiritual ideas apprehended

 Knowing the Science of creation in which all is Mind
50930 and its ideas Jesus rebuked the material thought of his
 fellowcountrymen Ye can discern the face of the
5101 sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times
 How much more should we seek to apprehend the spirit
5103 ual ideas of God than to dwell on the objects
 of sense To discern the rhythm of Spirit
 and to be holy thought must be purely spiritual

5106 Genesis i 15 And let them be for lights in the firma
 ment of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it
 was so

5109 Truth and Love enlighten the understanding in whose
 light shall we see light and this illumination is re
 flected spiritually by all who walk in the light and turn
51012 away from a false material sense

 Genesis i 16 And God made two great lights the
 greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the
51015 night He made the stars also

 Geology a failure

 The sun is a metaphorical representation of Soul out
 side the body giving existence and intelligence to the
51018 universe Love alone can impart the limit
 less idea of infinite Mind Geology has never
 explained the earths formations it cannot explain them
51021 There is no Scriptural allusion to solar light until time has
 been already divided into evening and morning and the
 allusion to fluids Genesis i 2 indicates a supposed for
51024 mation of matter by the resolving of fluids into solids
 analogous to the suppositional resolving of thoughts into
 material things

 Spiritual subdivision

51027 Light is a symbol of Mind of Life Truth and Love
 and not a vitalizing property of matter Sci
 ence reveals only one Mind and this one shin
51030 ing by its own light and governing the universe including
5111 man in perfect harmony This Mind forms ideas its
 own images subdivides and radiates their borrowed light
5113 intelligence and so explains the Scripture phrase whose
 seed is in itself Thus Gods ideas multiply and re
 plenish the earth The divine Mind supports the sub
5116 limity magnitude and infinitude of spiritual creation

 Genesis i 17 18 And God set them in the firmament of
 the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over
5119 the day and over the night and to divide the light from the
 darkness and God saw that it was good

 Darkness scattered

 In divine Science which is the seal of Deity and has
51112 the impress of heaven God is revealed as in
 finite light In the eternal Mind no night is
 there

51115 Genesis i 19 And the evening and the morning were
 the fourth day

 The changing glow and full effulgence of Gods infi
51118 nite ideas images mark the periods of progress

 Genesis i 20 And God said Let the waters bring forth
 abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl
51121 that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of
 heaven

 Soaring aspirations

 To mortal mind the universe is liquid solid and aeri
51124 form Spiritually interpreted rocks and mountains stand
 for solid and grand ideas Animals and mor
 tals metaphorically present the gradation of
51127 mortal thought rising in the scale of intelligence taking
 form in masculine feminine or neuter gender The
 fowls which fly above the earth in the open firmament
5121 of heaven correspond to aspirations soaring beyond and
 above corporeality to the understanding of the incorporeal
5123 and divine Principle Love

 Genesis i 21 And God created great whales and every
 living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth
5126 abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after
 his kind and God saw that it was good

 Seraphic symbols

 Spirit is symbolized by strength presence and power
5129 and also by holy thoughts winged with Love These an
 gels of His presence which have the holiest
 charge abound in the spiritual atmosphere of
51212 Mind and consequently reproduce their own character
 istics Their individual forms we know not but we do
 know that their natures are allied to Gods nature and
51215 spiritual blessings thus typified are the externalized yet
 subjective states of faith and spiritual understanding

 Genesis i 22 And God blessed them saying Be fruit
51218 ful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let
 fowl multiply in the earth

 Multiplication of pure ideas

 Spirit blesses the multiplication of its own pure and
51221 perfect ideas From the infinite elements of the one
 Mind emanate all form color quality and
 quantity and these are mental both primarily
51224 and secondarily Their spiritual nature is discerned only
 through the spiritual senses Mortal mind inverts the true
 likeness and confers animal names and natures upon its
51227 own misconceptions Ignorant of the origin and opera
 tions of mortal mind  that is ignorant of itself  this
 socalled mind puts forth its own qualities and claims
51230 God as their author albeit God is ignorant of the ex
5131 istence of both this mortal mentality socalled and its
 claim for the claim usurps the deific prerogatives and is
5133 an attempted infringement on infinity

 Genesis i 23 And the evening and the morning were
 the fifth day

 Spiritual spheres

5136 Advancing spiritual steps in the teeming universe of
 Mind lead on to spiritual spheres and exalted beings To
 material sense this divine universe is dim and
5139 distant gray in the sombre hues of twilight
 but anon the veil is lifted and the scene shifts into light
 In the record time is not yet measured by solar revolutions
51312 and the motions and reflections of deific power cannot be
 apprehended until divine Science becomes the interpreter

 Genesis i 24 And God said Let the earth bring forth
51315 the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing
 and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so

 Continuity of thoughts

 Spirit diversifies classifies and individualizes all
51318 thoughts which are as eternal as the Mind
 conceiving them but the intelligence exist
 ence and continuity of all individuality remain in God
51321 who is the divinely creative Principle thereof

 Genesis i 25 And God made the beast of the earth after
 his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that
51324 creepeth upon the earth after his kind and God saw that
 it was good

 Gods thoughts are spiritual realities

 God creates all forms of reality His thoughts are
51327 spiritual realities Socalled mortal mind  being non
 existent and consequently not within the range of im
5141 mortal existence  could not by simulating deific power
 invert the divine creation and afterwards recreate per
5143 sons or things upon its own plane since noth
 ing exists beyond the range of allinclusive
 infinity in which and of which God is the
5146 sole creator Mind joyous in strength dwells in the
 realm of Mind Minds infinite ideas run and dis
 port themselves In humility they climb the heights of
5149 holiness

 Qualities of thought

 Moral courage is the lion of the tribe of Juda the
 king of the mental realm Free and fearless it roams in
51412 the forest Undisturbed it lies in the open
 field or rests in green pastures    beside
 the still waters In the figurative transmission from the
51415 divine thought to the human diligence promptness and
 perseverance are likened to the cattle upon a thousand
 hills They carry the baggage of stern resolve and
51418 keep pace with highest purpose Tenderness accompa
 nies all the might imparted by Spirit The individ
 uality created by God is not carnivorous as witness the
51421 millennial estate pictured by Isaiah 

 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb
 And the leopard shall lie down with the kid
51424 And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together
 And a little child shall lead them

 Creatures of God useful

 Understanding the control which Love held over all
51427 Daniel felt safe in the lions den and Paul proved the
 viper to be harmless All of Gods creatures
 moving in the harmony of Science are harm
51430 less useful indestructible A realization of this grand
 verity was a source of strength to the ancient worthies
5151 It supports Christian healing and enables its possessor
 to emulate the example of Jesus And God saw that
5153 it was good

 The serpent harmless

 Patience is symbolized by the tireless worm creeping
 over lofty summits persevering in its intent The ser
5156 pent of Gods creating is neither subtle nor
 poisonous but is a wise idea charming in its
 adroitness for Loves ideas are subject to the Mind which
5159 forms them  the power which changeth the serpent
 into a staff

 Genesis i 26 And God said Let us make man in our
51512 image after our likeness and let them have dominion over
 the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over
 the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping
51515 thing that creepeth upon the earth

 Elohistic plurality

 The eternal Elohim includes the forever universe
 The name Elohim is in the plural but this plurality of
51518 Spirit does not imply more than one God nor
 does it imply three persons in one It relates
 to the oneness the triunity of Life Truth and Love
51521 Let them have dominion Man is the family name
 for all ideas  the sons and daughters of God All that
 God imparts moves in accord with Him reflecting good
51524 ness and power

 Reflected likeness

 Your mirrored reflection is your own image or like
 ness If you lift a weight your reflection does this also
51527 If you speak the lips of this likeness move in
 accord with yours Now compare man before
 the mirror to his divine Principle God Call the mirror
51530 divine Science and call man the reflection Then note
5161 how true according to Christian Science is the reflection
 to its original As the reflection of yourself appears in
5163 the mirror so you being spiritual are the reflection of
 God The substance Life intelligence Truth and Love
 which constitute Deity are reflected by His creation
5166 and when we subordinate the false testimony of the
 corporeal senses to the facts of Science we shall see
 this true likeness and reflection everywhere

 Love imparts beauty

5169 God fashions all things after His own likeness Life
 is reflected in existence Truth in truthfulness God in
 goodness which impart their own peace and
51612 permanence Love redolent with unselfish
 ness bathes all in beauty and light The grass beneath
 our feet silently exclaims The meek shall inherit the
51615 earth The modest arbutus sends her sweet breath to
 heaven The great rock gives shadow and shelter The
 sunlight glints from the churchdome glances into the
51618 prisoncell glides into the sickchamber brightens the
 flower beautifies the landscape blesses the earth Man
 made in His likeness possesses and reflects Gods domin
51621 ion over all the earth Man and woman as coexistent
 and eternal with God forever reflect in glorified quality
 the infinite FatherMother God

51624 Genesis i 27 So God created man in His own image
 in the image of God created He him male and female
 created He them

 Ideal man and woman

51627 To emphasize this momentous thought it is repeated
 that God made man in His own image to reflect the
 divine Spirit It follows that man is a generic
51630 term Masculine feminine and neuter gen
 ders are human concepts In one of the ancient lan
5171 guages the word for man is used also as the synonym of
 mind This definition has been weakened by anthropo
5173 morphism or a humanization of Deity The word an
 thropomorphic in such a phrase as an anthropomorphic
 God is derived from two Greek words signifying man
5176 and form and may be defined as a mortally mental at
 tempt to reduce Deity to corporeality The lifegiving
 quality of Mind is Spirit not matter The ideal man
5179 corresponds to creation to intelligence and to Truth
 The ideal woman corresponds to Life and to Love In
 divine Science we have not as much authority for con
51712 sidering God masculine as we have for considering
 Him feminine for Love imparts the clearest idea of
 Deity

 Divine personality

51715 The world believes in many persons but if God is per
 sonal there is but one person because there is but one
 God His personality can only be reflected
51718 not transmitted God has countless ideas and
 they all have one Principle and parentage The only
 proper symbol of God as person is Minds infinite ideal
51721 What is this ideal Who shall behold it This ideal
 is Gods own image spiritual and infinite Even eternity
 can never reveal the whole of God since there is no limit
51724 to infinitude or to its reflections

 Genesis i 28 And God blessed them and God said unto
 them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
51727 and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea
 and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing
 that moveth upon the earth

 Birthright of man

51730 Divine Love blesses its own ideas and causes them to
 multiply  to manifest His power Man is not made
5181 to till the soil His birthright is dominion not sub
 jection He is lord of the belief in earth
5183 and heaven  himself subordinate alone to
 his Maker This is the Science of being

 Genesis i 29 30 And God said Behold I have given
5186 you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all
 the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree
 yielding seed to you it shall be for meat And to every
5189 beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to
 everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is
 life I have given every green herb for meat and it
51812 was so

 Assistance in brotherhood

 God gives the lesser idea of Himself for a link to the
 greater and in return the higher always protects the
51815 lower The rich in spirit help the poor in
 one grand brotherhood all leaving the same
 Principle or Father and blessed is that man who seeth
51818 his brothers need and supplieth it seeking his own in
 anothers good Love giveth to the least spiritual idea
 might immortality and goodness which shine through
51821 all as the blossom shines through the bud All the varied
 expressions of God reflect health holiness immortality 
 infinite Life Truth and Love

51824 Genesis i 31 And God saw everything that He had
 made and behold it was very good And the evening and
 the morning were the sixth day

 Perfection of creation

51827 The divine Principle or Spirit comprehends and ex
 presses all and all must therefore be as perfect is the
 divine Principle is perfect Nothing is new to Spirit
5191 Nothing can be novel to eternal Mind the author of all
 things who from all eternity knoweth His own ideas
5193 Deity was satisfied with His work How could
 He be otherwise since the spiritual creation
 was the outgrowth the emanation of His infinite self
5196 containment and immortal wisdom

 Genesis ii 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were
 finished and all the host of them

 Infinity measureless

5199 Thus the ideas of God in universal being are complete
 and forever expressed for Science reveals infinity and
 the fatherhood and motherhood of Love Hu
51912 man capacity is slow to discern and to grasp
 Gods creation and the divine power and presence which
 go with it demonstrating its spiritual origin Mortals
51915 can never know the infinite until they throw off the old
 man and reach the spiritual image and likeness What
 can fathom infinity How shall we declare Him till
51918 in the language of the apostle we all come in the unity
 of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
 a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the ful
51921 ness of Christ

 Genesis ii 2 And on the seventh day God ended His
 work which He had made and He rested on the seventh
51924 day from all His work which He had made

 Resting in holy work

 God rests in action Imparting has not impoverished
 can never impoverish the divine Mind No
51927 exhaustion follows the action of this Mind
 according to the apprehension of divine Science The
5201 highest and sweetest rest even from a human standpoint
 is in holy work

 Love and man coexistent

5203 Unfathomable Mind is expressed The depth breadth
 height might majesty and glory of infinite Love fill all
 space That is enough Human language
5206 can repeat only an infinitesimal part of what
 exists The absolute ideal man is no more seen nor
 comprehended by mortals than is His infinite Principle
5209 Love Principle and its idea man are coexistent and
 eternal The numerals of infinity called seven days can
 never be reckoned according to the calendar of time
52012 These days will appear as mortality disappears and they
 will reveal eternity newness of Life in which all sense of
 error forever disappears and thought accepts the divine
52015 infinite calculus

 Genesis ii 4 5 These are the generations of the heavens
 and of the earth when they were created in the day that the
52018 Lord God Jehovah made the earth and the heavens and
 every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every
 herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God Jehovah
52021 had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not
 a man to till the ground

 Growth is from Mind

 Here is the emphatic declaration that God creates all
52024 through Mind not through matter  that the plant
 grows not because of seed or soil but because
 growth is the eternal mandate of Mind Mor
52027 tal thought drops into the ground but the immortal creat
 ing thought is from above not from beneath Because
 Mind makes all there is nothing left to be made by a
52030 lower power Spirit acts through the Science of Mind
 never causing man to till the ground but making him
5211 superior to the soil Knowledge of this lifts man above
 the sod above earth and its environments to conscious
5213 spiritual harmony and eternal being

 Spiritual narrative

 Here the inspired record closes its narrative of being
 that is without beginning or end All that is made is
5216 the work of God and all is good We leave
 this brief glorious history of spiritual creation
 as stated in the first chapter of Genesis in the hands of
5219 God not of man in the keeping of Spirit not matter 
 joyfully acknowledging now and forever Gods supremacy
 omnipotence and omnipresence

52112 The harmony and immortality of man are intact We
 should look away from the opposite supposition that man
 is created materially and turn our gaze to the spiritual
52115 record of creation to that which should be engraved on
 the understanding and heart with the point of a diamond
 and the pen of an angel


52118 The reader will naturally ask if there is nothing more
 about creation in the book of Genesis Indeed there is
 but the continued account is mortal and material

52121 Genesis ii 6 But there went up a mist from the earth
 and watered the whole face of the ground

 The story of error

 The Science and truth of the divine creation have been
52124 presented in the verses already considered and now the
 opposite error a material view of creation is
 to be set forth The second chapter of Gene
52127 sis contains a statement of this material view of God and
 the universe a statement which is the exact opposite of
 scientific truth as before recorded The history of error
52130 or matter if veritable would set aside the omnipotence
5221 of Spirit but it is the false history in contradistinction
 to the true

 The two records

5223 The Science of the first record proves the falsity of
 the second If one is true the other is false for they are
 antagonistic The first record assigns all
5226 might and government to God and endows
 man out of Gods perfection and power The second
 record chronicles man as mutable and mortal  as hav
5229 ing broken away from Deity and as revolving in an orbit
 of his own Existence separate from divinity Science
 explains as impossible

52212 This second record unmistakably gives the history of
 error in its externalized forms called life and intelli
 gence in matter It records pantheism opposed to the
52215 supremacy of divine Spirit but this state of things is
 declared to be temporary and this man to be mortal 
 dust returning to dust

 Erroneous representation

52218 In this erroneous theory matter takes the place of Spirit
 Matter is represented as the lifegiving principle of the
 earth Spirit is represented as entering mat
52221 ter in order to create man Gods glowing
 denunciations of man when not found in His
 image the likeness of Spirit convince reason and coincide
52224 with revelation in declaring this material creation false

 Hypothetical reversal

 This latter part of the second chapter of Genesis which
 portrays Spirit as supposedly cooperating with matter in
52227 constructing the universe is based on some
 hypothesis of error for the Scripture just pre
 ceding declares Gods work to be finished Does Life
52230 Truth and Love produce death error and hatred Does
 the creator condemn His own creation Does the un
 erring Principle of divine law change or repent It can
5231 not be so Yet one might so judge from an unintelligent
 perusal of the Scriptural account now under comment

 Mist or false claim

5233 Because of its false basis the mist of obscurity evolved
 by error deepens the false claim and finally declares that
 God knows error and that error can improve
5236 His creation Although presenting the exact
 opposite of Truth the lie claims to be truth The crea
 tions of matter arise from a mist or false claim or from
5239 mystification and not from the firmament or under
 standing which God erects between the true and false
 In error everything comes from beneath not from above
52312 All is material myth instead of the reflection of
 Spirit

 Distinct documents

 It may be worth while here to remark that according
52315 to the best scholars there are clear evidences of two dis
 tinct documents in the early part of the book of
 Genesis One is called the Elohistic because
52318 the Supreme Being is therein called Elohim The other
 document is called the Jehovistic because Deity therein is
 always called Jehovah  or Lord God as our common
52321 version translates it

 Jehovah or Elohim

 Throughout the first chapter of Genesis and in three
 verses of the second  in what we understand to be the
52324 spiritually scientific account of creation  it is
 Elohim God who creates From the fourth
 verse of chapter two to chapter five the creator is called
52327 Jehovah or the Lord The different accounts become
 more and more closely intertwined to the end of chapter
 twelve after which the distinction is not definitely trace
52330 able In the historic parts of the Old Testament it is
 usually Jehovah peculiarly the divine sovereign of the
 Hebrew people who is referred to

 Gods of the heathen

5241 The idolatry which followed this material mythology is
 seen in the Phoenician worship of Baal in the Moabitish
5243 god Chemosh in the Moloch of the Amorites
 in the Hindoo Vishnu in the Greek Aphro
 dite and in a thousand other socalled deities

 Jehovah a tribal deity

5246 It was also found among the Israelites who constantly
 went after strange gods They called the Supreme
 Being by the national name of Jehovah In
5249 that name of Jehovah the true idea of God
 seems almost lost God becomes a man of war a
 tribal god to be worshipped rather than Love the divine
52412 Principle to be lived and loved

 Genesis ii 7 And the Lord God Jehovah formed man
 of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils
52415 the breath of life and man became a living soul

 Creation reversed

 Did the divine and infinite Principle become a finite
 deity that he should now be called Jehovah With
 l8 a single command Mind had made man
 both male and female How then could a
 material organization become the basis of man How
52421 could the nonintelligent become the medium of Mind
 and error be the enunciator of Truth Matter is not
 the reflection of Spirit yet God is reflected in all His
52424 creation Is this addition to His creation real or un
 real Is it the truth or is it a lie concerning man and
 God

52427 It must be a lie for God presently curses the ground
 Could Spirit evolve its opposite matter and give matter
 ability to sin and suffer Is Spirit God injected into
52430 dust and eventually ejected at the demand of matter
 Does Spirit enter dust and lose therein the divine nature
5251 and omnipotence Does Mind God enter matter to be
 come there a mortal sinner animated by the breath of
5253 God In this narrative the validity of matter is opposed
 not the validity of Spirit or Spirits creations Man re
 flects God mankind represents the Adamic race and is
5256 a human not a divine creation

 Definitions of man

 The following are some of the equivalents of the term
 man in different languages In the Saxon mankind a
5259 woman any one in the Welsh that which rises
 up  the primary sense being image form in
 the Hebrew image similitude in the Icelandic mind
52512 The following translation is from the Icelandic 

 And God said Let us make man after our mind and
 our likeness and God shaped man after His mind after
52515 Gods mind shaped He Him and He shaped them male and
 female

 No baneful creation

 In the Gospel of John it is declared that all things were
52518 made through the Word of God and without Him the
 logos or word was not anything made that
 was made Everything good or worthy God
52521 made Whatever is valueless or baneful He did not
 make  hence its unreality In the Science of Genesis
 we read that He saw everything which He had made
52524 and behold it was very good The corporeal senses
 declare otherwise and if we give the same heed to the
 history of error as to the records of truth the Scriptural
52527 record of sin and death favors the false conclusion of the
 material senses Sin sickness and death must be deemed
 as devoid of reality as they are of good God

52530 Genesis ii 9 And out of the ground made the Lord God
 Jehovah to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight
5261 and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the
 garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil

 Contradicting first creation

5263 The previous and more scientific record of creation
 declares that God made every plant of the field be
 fore it was in the earth This opposite
5266 declaration this statement that life issues
 from matter contradicts the teaching of the first chap
 ter  namely that all Life is God Belief is less than
5269 understanding Belief involves theories of material hear
 ing sight touch taste and smell termed the five senses
 The appetites and passions sin sickness and death
52612 follow in the train of this error of a belief in intelligent
 matter

 Record of error

 The first mention of evil is in the legendary Scriptural
52615 text in the second chapter of Genesis God pronounced
 good all that He created and the Scriptures
 declare that He created all The tree of
52618 life stands for the idea of Truth and the sword which
 guards it is the type of divine Science The tree of
 knowledge stands for the erroneous doctrine that the
52621 knowledge of evil is as real hence as Godbestowed as
 the knowledge of good Was evil instituted through God
 Love Did He create this fruitbearer of sin in contra
52624 diction of the first creation This second biblical account
 is a picture of error throughout

 Genesis ii 15 And the Lord God Jehovah took the
52627 man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and
 to keep it

 Garden of Eden

 The name Eden according to Cruden means pleasure
52630 delight In this text Eden stands for the mortal mate
5271 rial body God could not put Mind into matter nor in
 finite Spirit into finite form to dress it and
5273 keep it  to make it beautiful or to cause it
 to live and grow Man is Gods reflection needing no
 cultivation but ever beautiful and complete

5276 Genesis ii 16 17 And the Lord God Jehovah com
 manded the man saying Of every tree of the garden thou
 mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good
5279 and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou
 eatest thereof thou shalt surely die

 No temptation from God

 Here the metaphor represents God Love as tempting
52712 man but the Apostle James says God cannot be
 tempted with evil neither tempteth He any
 man It is true that a knowledge of evil would
52715 make man mortal It is plain also that mate
 rial perception gathered from the corporeal senses consti
 tutes evil and mortal knowledge But is it true that God
52718 good made the tree of life to be the tree of death to His
 own creation Has evil the reality of good Evil is un
 real because it is a lie  false in every statement

52721 Genesis ii 19 And out of the ground the Lord God
 Jehovah formed every beast of the field and every fowl
 of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he
52724 would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living
 creature that was the name thereof

 Creations counterfeit

 Here the lie represents God as repeating creation but
52727 doing so materially not spiritually and ask
 ing a prospective sinner to help Him Is the
 Supreme Being retrograding and is man giving up his
52730 dignity Was it requisite for the formation of man
5281 that dust should become sentient when all being is the
 reflection of the eternal Mind and the record declares
5283 that God has already created man both male and
 female That Adam gave the name and nature of
 animals is solely mythological and material It can
5286 not be true that man was ordered to create man anew
 in partnership with God this supposition was a dream
 a myth

5289 Genesis ii 21 22 And the Lord God Jehovah Yawah
 caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
 He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead
52812 thereof and the rib which the Lord God Jehovah had
 taken from man made He a woman and brought her unto
 the man

 Hypnotic surgery

52815 Here falsity error credits Truth God with inducing
 a sleep or hypnotic state in Adam in order to perform a
 surgical operation on him and thereby create
52818 woman This is the first record of magnet
 ism Beginning creation with darkness instead of light
  materially rather than spiritually  error now simu
52821 lates the work of Truth mocking Love and declar
 ing what great things error has done Beholding the
 creations of his own dream and calling them real and
52824 Godgiven Adam  alias error  gives them names
 Afterwards he is supposed to become the basis of the
 creation of woman and of his own kind calling them
52827 mankind  that is a kind of man

 Mental midwifery

 But according to this narrative surgery was first per
 formed mentally and without instruments
52830 and this may be a useful hint to the medical
 faculty Later in human history when the forbidden
5291 fruit was bringing forth fruit of its own kind there
 came a suggestion of change in the modus operandi 
5293 that man should be born of woman not woman again
 taken from man It came about also that instruments
 were needed to assist the birth of mortals The first
5296 system of suggestive obstetrics has changed Another
 change will come as to the nature and origin of man
 and this revelation will destroy the dream of existence
5299 reinstate reality usher in Science and the glorious fact
 of creation that both man and woman proceed from
 God and are His eternal children belonging to no lesser
52912 parent

 Genesis iii 13 Now the serpent was more subtle than
 any beast of the field which the Lord God Jehovah had
52915 made And he said unto the woman Yea hath God said
 Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden And the
 woman said unto the serpent We may eat of the fruit of
52918 the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is
 in the midst of the garden God hath said Ye shall not eat
 of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die

 Mythical serpent

52921 Whence comes a talking lying serpent to tempt the
 children of divine Love The serpent enters into the
 metaphor only as evil We have nothing in the
52924 animal kingdom which represents the species
 described  a talking serpent  and should rejoice that
 evil by whatever figure presented contradicts itself and
52927 has neither origin nor support in Truth and good Seeing
 this we should have faith to fight all claims of evil be
 cause we know that they are worthless and unreal

 Error or Adam

52930 Adam the synonym for error stands for a belief of
 material mind He begins his reign over man some
5301 what mildly but he increases in falsehood and his days
 become shorter In this development the im
5303 mortal spiritual law of Truth is made manifest
 as forever opposed to mortal material sense

 Divine providence

 In divine Science man is sustained by God the divine
5306 Principle of being The earth at Gods command brings
 forth food for mans use Knowing this Jesus
 once said Take no thought for your life
5309 what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink  presuming
 not on the prerogative of his creator but recognizing God
 the Father and Mother of all as able to feed and clothe
53012 man as He doth the lilies

 Genesis iii 4 5 And the serpent said unto the woman
 Ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day
53015 ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall
 be as gods knowing good and evil

 Errors assumption

 This myth represents error as always asserting its su
53018 periority over truth giving the lie to divine Science and
 saying through the material senses I can
 open your eyes I can do what God has not
53021 done for you Bow down to me and have another god
 Only admit that I am real that sin and sense are more
 pleasant to the eyes than spiritual Life more to be de
53024 sired than Truth and I shall know you and you will be
 mine Thus Spirit and flesh war

 Scriptural allegory

 The history of error is a dreamnarrative The dream
53027 has no reality no intelligence no mind therefore the
 dreamer and dream are one for neither is
 true nor real First this narrative supposes
53030 that something springs from nothing that matter pre
 cedes mind Second it supposes that mind enters matter
5311 and matter becomes living substantial and intelligent
 The order of this allegory  the belief that everything
5313 springs from dust instead of from Deity  has been main
 tained in all the subsequent forms of belief This is the
 error  that mortal man starts materially that non
5316 intelligence becomes intelligence that mind and soul are
 both right and wrong

 Higher hope

 It is well that the upper portions of the brain represent
5319 the higher moral sentiments as if hope were ever prophe
 sying thus The human mind will sometime
 rise above all material and physical sense ex
53112 changing it for spiritual perception and exchanging hu
 man concepts for the divine consciousness Then man
 will recognize his Godgiven dominion and being

 Biological inventions

53115 If in the beginning mans body originated in non
 intelligent dust and mind was afterwards put into body
 by the creator why is not this divine order
53118 still maintained by God in perpetuating the
 species Who will say that minerals vegetables and
 animals have a propagating property of their own
53121 Who dares to say either that God is in matter or that
 matter exists without God Has man sought out other
 creative inventions and so changed the method of his
53124 Maker

 Which institutes Life  matter or Mind Does Life
 begin with Mind or with matter Is Life sustained by
53127 matter or by Spirit Certainly not by both since flesh
 wars against Spirit and the corporeal senses can take no
 cognizance of Spirit The mythologic theory of mate
53130 rial life at no point resembles the scientifically Christian
 record of man as created by Mind in the image and like
 ness of God and having dominion over all the earth Did
5321 God at first create one man unaided  that is Adam 
 but afterwards require the union of the two sexes in order
5323 to create the rest of the human family No God makes
 and governs all

 Progeny cursed

 All human knowledge and material sense must be
5326 gained from the five corporeal senses Is this knowledge
 safe when eating its first fruits brought death
 In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
5329 surely die was the prediction in the story under consid
 eration Adam and his progeny were cursed not blessed
 and this indicates that the divine Spirit or Father con
53212 demns material man and remands him to dust

 Genesis iii 9 10 And the Lord God Jehovah called
 unto Adam and said unto him Where art thou And he
53215 said I heard Thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
 because I was naked and I hid myself

 Shame the effect of sin

 Knowledge and pleasure evolved through material
53218 sense produced the immediate fruits of fear and shame
 Ashamed before Truth error shrank abashed
 from the divine voice calling out to the cor
53221 poreal senses Its summons may be thus paraphrased
 Where art thou man Is Mind in matter Is Mind
 capable of error as well as of truth of evil as well as of
53224 good when God is All and He is Mind and there is but
 one God hence one Mind

 Fear comes of error

 Fear was the first manifestation of the error of mate
53227 rial sense Thus error began and will end the dream of
 matter In the allegory the body had been
 naked and Adam knew it not but now error
53230 demands that mind shall see and feel through matter the
 five senses The first impression material man had of
5331 himself was one of nakedness and shame Had he lost
 mans rich inheritance and Gods behest dominion over
5333 all the earth No This had never been bestowed on
 Adam

 Genesis iii 11 12 And He said Who told thee that
5336 thou wast naked Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I
 commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat And the man
 said The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me she gave
5339 me of the tree and I did eat

 The beguiling first lie

 Here there is an attempt to trace all human errors
 directly or indirectly to God or good as if He were the
53312 creator of evil The allegory shows that the
 snaketalker utters the first voluble lie which
 beguiles the woman and demoralizes the man Adam
53315 alias mortal error charges God and woman with his own
 dereliction saying The woman whom Thou gavest
 me is responsible According to this belief the rib taken
53318 from Adams side has grown into an evil mind named
 woman who aids man to make sinners more rapidly than
 he can alone Is this an help meet for man

53321 Materiality so obnoxious to God is already found in the
 rapid deterioration of the bone and flesh which came from
 Adam to form Eve The belief in material life and in
53324 telligence is growing worse at every step but error has its
 suppositional day and multiplies until the end thereof

 False womanhood

 Truth crossquestioning man as to His knowledge of
53327 error finds woman the first to confess her fault She
 says  The serpent beguiled me and I did
 eat as much as to say in meek penitence
53330 Neither man nor God shall father my fault She has
 already learned that corporeal sense is the serpent Hence
5341 she is first to abandon the belief in the material origin of
 man and to discern spiritual creation This hereafter
5343 enabled woman to be the mother of Jesus and to behold
 at the sepulchre the risen Saviour who was soon to mani
 fest the deathless man of Gods creating This enabled
5346 woman to be first to interpret the Scriptures in their true
 sense which reveals the spiritual origin of man

 Genesis iii 14 15 And the Lord God Jehovah said
5349 unto the serpent    I will put enmity between thee and
 the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall
 bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel

 Spirit and flesh

53412 This prophecy has been fulfilled The Son of the Virgin
 mother unfolded the remedy for Adam or error and the
 Apostle Paul explains this warfare between the
53415 idea of divine power which Jesus presented
 and mythological material intelligence called energy and
 opposed to Spirit

53418 Paul says in his epistle to the Romans The carnal
 mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the
 law of God neither indeed can be So then they that
53421 are in the flesh cannot please God But ye are not in the
 flesh but in the Spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell
 in you

 Bruising sins head

53424 There will be greater mental opposition to the spirit
 ual scientific meaning of the Scriptures than there has
 ever been since the Christian era began The
53427 serpent material sense will bite the heel of
 the woman  will struggle to destroy the spiritual idea
 of Love and the woman this idea will bruise the head
53430 of lust The spiritual idea has given the understanding
5351 a foothold in Christian Science The seed of Truth and
 the seed of error of belief and of understanding  yea
5353 the seed of Spirit and the seed of matter  are the wheat
 and tares which time will separate the one to be burned
 the other to be garnered into heavenly places

5356 Genesis iii 16 Unto the woman He said I will greatly
 multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou
 shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy
5359 husband and he shall rule over thee

 Judgment on error

 Divine Science deals its chief blow at the supposed ma
 terial foundations of life and intelligence It dooms idol
53512 atry A belief in other gods other creators
 and other creations must go down before Chris
 tian Science It unveils the results of sin as shown in
53515 sickness and death When will man pass through the
 open gate of Christian Science into the heaven of Soul
 into the heritage of the first born among men Truth is
53518 indeed  the way

 Genesis iii 1719 And unto Adam He said Because
 thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast
53521 eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou
 shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in
 sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns
53524 also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt
 eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou
 eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it
53527 wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt
 thou return

 New earth and no more sea

 In the first chapter of Genesis we read And God
53530 called the dry land Earth and the gathering together
5361 of the waters called He Seas In the Apocalypse it is
 written And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for
5363 the first heaven and the first earth were passed
 away and there was no more sea In St
 Johns vision heaven and earth stand for spir
5366 itual ideas and the sea as a symbol of tempesttossed
 human concepts advancing and receding is represented
 as having passed away The divine understanding reigns
5369 is all and there is no other consciousness

 The fall of error

 The way of error is awful to contemplate The illu
 sion of sin is without hope or God If mans spiritual
53612 gravitation and attraction to one Father in
 whom we  live and move and have our be
 ing should be lost and if man should be governed by
53615 corporeality instead of divine Principle by body instead
 of by Soul man would be annihilated Created by flesh
 instead of by Spirit starting from matter instead of from
53618 God mortal man would be governed by himself The
 blind leading the blind both would fall

 True attainment

 Passions and appetites must end in pain They are
53621 of few days and full of trouble Their supposed joys
 are cheats Their narrow limits belittle their gratifica
 tions and hedge about their achievements with thorns
53624 Mortal mind accepts the erroneous material concep
 tion of life and joy but the true idea is gained from the
 immortal side Through toil struggle and sor
53627 row what do mortals attain They give up
 their belief in perishable life and happiness the mortal
 and material return to dust and the immortal is reached

53630 Genesis iii 2224 And the Lord God Jehovah said
 Behold the man is become as one of us to know good
5371 and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take
 also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore
5373 the Lord God Jehovah sent him forth from the garden
 of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
 So He drove out the man and He placed at the east
5376 of the garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword
 which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of
 life

 Justice and recompense

5379 A knowledge of evil was never the essence of divin
 ity or manhood In the first chapter of Genesis evil
 has no local habitation nor name Crea
53712 tion is there represented as spiritual entire
 and good Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he
 also reap Error excludes itself from harmony Sin
53715 is its own punishment Truth guards the gateway
 to harmony Error tills its own barren soil and buries
 itself in the ground since ground and dust stand for
53718 nothingness

 Inspired interpretation

 No one can reasonably doubt that the purpose of this
 allegory  this second account in Genesis  is to depict
53721 the falsity of error and the effects of error
 Subsequent Bible revelation is coordinate
 with the Science of creation recorded in the
53724 first chapter of Genesis Inspired writers interpret the
 Word spiritually while the ordinary historian interprets
 it literally Literally taken the text is made to appear
53727 contradictory in some places and divine Love which
 blessed the earth and gave it to man for a possession is
 represented as changeable The literal meaning would
53730 imply that God withheld from man the opportunity to
 reform lest man should improve it and become better
 but this is not the nature of God who is Love always 
5381 Love infinitely wise and altogether lovely who seeketh
 not her own

 Spiritual gateway

5383 Truth should and does drive error out of all selfhood
 Truth is a twoedged sword guarding and guiding
 Truth places the cherub wisdom at the gate
5386 of understanding to note the proper guests
 Radiant with mercy and justice the sword of Truth
 gleams afar and indicates the infinite distance between
5389 Truth and error between the material and spiritual 
 the unreal and the real

 Contrasted testimony

 The sun giving light and heat to the earth is a figure
53812 of divine Life and Love enlightening and sustaining the
 universe The tree of life is significant of
 eternal reality or being The tree of knowl
53815 edge typifies unreality The testimony of the serpent is
 significant of the illusion of error of the false claims that
 misrepresent God good Sin sickness and death have
53818 no record in the Elohistic introduction of Genesis in which
 God creates the heavens earth and man Until that
 which contradicts the truth of being enters into the arena
53821 evil has no history and evil is brought into view only as
 the unreal in contradistinction to the real and eternal

 Genesis iv 1 And Adam knew Eve his wife and she
53824 conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man
 from the Lord Jehovah

 Erroneous conception

 This account is given not of immortal man but of mor
53827 tal man and of sin which is temporal As both mortal
 man and sin have a beginning they must
 consequently have an end while the sinless
53830 real man is eternal Eves declaration I have gotten
 a man from the Lord supposes God to be the author
5391 of sin and sins progeny This false sense of existence
 is fratricidal In the words of Jesus it evil devil is
5393 a murderer from the beginning Error begins by
 reckoning life as separate from Spirit thus sapping the
 foundations of immortality as if life and immortality
5396 were something which matter can both give and take
 away

 Only one standard

 What can be the standard of good of Spirit of Life
5399 or of Truth if they produce their opposites such as evil
 matter error and death God could never
 impart an element of evil and man possesses
53912 nothing which he has not derived from God How then
 has man a basis for wrongdoing Whence does he
 obtain the propensity or power to do evil Has Spirit
53915 resigned to matter the government of the universe

 A type of falsehood

 The Scriptures declare that God condemned this lie as
 to mans origin and character by condemning its symbol
53918 the serpent to grovel beneath all the beasts
 of the field It is false to say that Truth and
 error commingle in creation In parable and argument
53921 this falsity is exposed by our Master as selfevidently
 wrong Disputing these points with the Pharisees and
 arguing for the Science of creation Jesus said Do men
53924 gather grapes of thorns Paul asked What com
 munion hath light with darkness And what concord
 hath Christ with Belial

 Scientific offspring

53927 The divine origin of Jesus gave him more than human
 power to expound the facts of creation and demonstrate
 the one Mind which makes and governs man
53930 and the universe The Science of creation
 so conspicuous in the birth of Jesus inspired his wisest
 and leastunderstood sayings and was the basis of his
5401 marvellous demonstrations Christ is the offspring of
 Spirit and spiritual existence shows that Spirit creates
5403 neither a wicked nor a mortal man lapsing into sin sick
 ness and death

 Cleansing upheaval

 In Isaiah we read I make peace and create evil I
5406 the Lord do all these things but the prophet referred to
 divine law as stirring up the belief in evil to its
 utmost when bringing it to the surface and re
5409 ducing it to its common denominator nothingness The
 muddy riverbed must be stirred in order to purify the
 stream In moral chemicalization when the symptoms
54012 of evil illusion are aggravated we may think in our igno
 rance that the Lord hath wrought an evil but we ought
 to know that Gods law uncovers socalled sin and its
54015 effects only that Truth may annihilate all sense of evil
 and all power to sin

 Allegiance to Spirit

 Science renders unto Caesar the things which are
54018 Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods It
 saith to the human sense of sin sickness and
 death God never made you and you are a
54021 false sense which hath no knowledge of God The pur
 pose of the Hebrew allegory representing error as assum
 ing a divine character is to teach mortals never to believe
54024 a lie

 Genesis iv 3 4 Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
 an offering unto the Lord Jehovah And Abel he also
54027 brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof

 Spiritual and material

 Cain is the type of mortal and material man conceived
 in sin and shapen in iniquity he is not the
54030 type of Truth and Love Material in origin
 and sense he brings a material offering to God Abel
5411 takes his offering from the firstlings of the flock A lamb
 is a more animate form of existence and more nearly re
5413 sembles a mindoffering than does Cains fruit Jealous
 of his brothers gift Cain seeks Abels life instead of mak
 ing his own gift a higher tribute to the Most High

5416 Genesis iv 4 5 And the Lord Jehovah had respect
 unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his
 offering He had not respect

5419 Had God more respect for the homage bestowed through
 a gentle animal than for the worship expressed by Cains
 fruit No but the lamb was a more spiritual type of
54112 even the human concept of Love than the herbs of the
 ground could be

 Genesis iv 8 Cain rose up against Abel his brother and
54115 slew him

 The erroneous belief that life substance and intelli
 gence can be material ruptures the life and brotherhood
54118 of man at the very outset

 Genesis iv 9 And the Lord Jehovah said unto Cain
 Where is Abel thy brother And he said I know not Am
54121 I my brothers keeper

 Brotherhood repudiated

 Here the serpentine lie invents new forms At first it
 usurps divine power It is supposed to say
54124 in the first instance Ye shall be as gods
 Now it repudiates even the human duty of man towards
 his brother

54127 Genesis iv 10 11 And He Jehovah said    The
 voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto Me from the ground
 And now art thou cursed from the earth

 Murder brings its curse

5421 The belief of life in matter sins at every step It in
 curs divine displeasure and it would kill Jesus that it
5423 might be rid of troublesome Truth Material
 beliefs would slay the spiritual idea when
 ever and wherever it appears Though error hides
5426 behind a lie and excuses guilt error cannot forever be
 concealed Truth through her eternal laws unveils
 error Truth causes sin to betray itself and sets upon
5429 error the mark of the beast Even the disposition to
 excuse guilt or to conceal it is punished The avoidance
 of justice and the denial of truth tend to perpetuate sin
54212 invoke crime jeopardize selfcontrol and mock divine
 mercy

 Genesis iv 15 And the Lord Jehovah said unto him
54215 Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken
 on him sevenfold And the Lord Jehovah set a mark
 upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him

 Retribution and remorse

54218 They that take the sword shall perish with the
 sword Let Truth uncover and destroy error in Gods
 own way and let human justice pattern the
54221 divine Sin will receive its full penalty both
 for what it is and for what it does Justice marks
 the sinner and teaches mortals not to remove the
54224 waymarks of God To envys own hell justice con
 signs the lie which to advance itself breaks Gods
 commandments

54227 Genesis iv 16 And Cain went out from the presence of
 the Lord Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod

 Climax of suffering

 The sinful misconception of Life as something less
5431 than God having no truth to support it falls back upon
 itself This error after reaching the climax of suffering
5433 yields to Truth and returns to dust but it
 is only mortal man and not the real man
 who dies The image of Spirit cannot be effaced since it
5436 is the idea of Truth and changes not but becomes more
 beautifully apparent at errors demise

 Dwelling in dreamland

 In divine Science the material man is shut out from
5439 the presence of God The five corporeal senses cannot
 take cognizance of Spirit They cannot come
 into His presence and must dwell in dream
54312 land until mortals arrive at the understanding that ma
 terial life with all its sin sickness and death is an illu
 sion against which divine Science is engaged in a warfare
54315 of extermination The great verities of existence are
 never excluded by falsity

 Man springs from Mind

 All error proceeds from the evidence before the mate
54318 rial senses If man is material and originates in an
 egg who shall say that he is not primarily
 dust May not Darwin be right in think
54321 ing that apehood preceded mortal manhood Minerals
 and vegetables are found according to divine Science
 to be the creations of erroneous thought not of matter
54324 Did man whom God created with a word originate
 in an egg When Spirit made all did it leave aught
 for matter to create Ideas of Truth alone are reflected
54327 in the myriad manifestations of Life and thus it is
 seen that man springs solely from Mind The belief
 that matter supports life would make Life or God
54330 mortal

 Material inception

 The text In the day that the Lord God Jehovah
 God made the earth and the heavens introduces the
5441 record of a material creation which followed the spiritual
  a creation so wholly apart from Gods that Spirit
5443 had no participation in it In Gods creation
 ideas became productive obedient to Mind
 There was no rain and not a man to till the ground
5446 Mind instead of matter being the producer Life was
 selfsustained Birth decay and death arise from the
 material sense of things not from the spiritual for in
5449 the latter Life consisteth not of the things which a man
 eateth Matter cannot change the eternal fact that
 man exists because God exists Nothing is new to the
54412 infinite Mind

 First evil suggestion

 In Science Mind neither produces matter nor does
 matter produce mind No mortal mind has the might
54415 or right or wisdom to create or to destroy
 All is under the control of the one Mind
 even God The first statement about evil  the first
54418 suggestion of more than the one Mind  is in the fable
 of the serpent The facts of creation as previously re
 corded include nothing of the kind

 Material personality

54421 The serpent is supposed to say Ye shall be as gods
 but these gods must be evolved from materiality and be
 the very antipodes of immortal and spiritual
54424 being Man is the likeness of Spirit but a
 material personality is not this likeness Therefore man
 in this allegory is neither a lesser god nor the image and
54427 likeness of the one God

 Material erroneous belief reverses understanding and
 truth It declares mind to be in and of matter socalled
54430 mortal life to be Life infinity to enter mans nostrils
 so that matter becomes spiritual Error begins with
 corporeality as the producer instead of divine Prin
5451 ciple and explains Deity through mortal and finite con
 ceptions

5453 Behold the man is become as one of us This could
 not be the utterance of Truth or Science for according
 to the record material man was fast degenerating and
5456 never had been divinely conceived

 Mental tillage

 The condemnation of mortals to till the ground means
 this  that mortals should so improve material belief
5459 by thought tending spiritually upward as to
 destroy materiality Man created by God
 was given dominion over the whole earth The notion
54512 of a material universe is utterly opposed to the theory
 of man as evolved from Mind Such fundamental errors
 send falsity into all human doctrines and conclusions
54515 and do not accord infinity to Deity Error tills the
 whole ground in this material theory which is entirely a
 false view destructive to existence and happiness Out
54518 side of Christian Science all is vague and hypothetical the
 opposite of Truth yet this opposite in its false view of
 God and man impudently demands a blessing

 Erroneous standpoint

54521 The translators of this record of scientific creation
 entertained a false sense of being They believed in
 the existence of matter its propagation and
54524 power From that standpoint of error they
 could not apprehend the nature and operation of Spirit
 Hence the seeming contradiction in that Scripture which
54527 is so glorious in its spiritual signification Truth has
 but one reply to all error  to sin sickness and death
 Dust nothingness thou art and unto dust nothingness
54530 shalt thou return

 Mortality mythical

 As in Adam error all die even so in Christ Truth
 shall all be made alive The mortality of man is a
5461 myth for man is immortal The false belief that spirit is
 now submerged in matter at some future time to be eman
5463 cipated from it  this belief alone is mortal
 Spirit God never germinates but is the same
 yesterday and today and forever If Mind God cre
5466 ates error that error must exist in the divine Mind and
 this assumption of error would dethrone the perfection
 of Deity

 No truth from a material basis

5469 Is Christian Science contradictory Is the divine
 Principle of creation misstated Has God no Science to
 declare Mind while matter is governed by un
54612 erring intelligence There went up a mist
 from the earth This represents error as
 starting from an idea of good on a material basis It
54615 supposes God and man to be manifested only through
 the corporeal senses although the material senses can
 take no cognizance of Spirit or the spiritual idea
54618 Genesis and the Apocalypse seem more obscure than
 other portions of the Scripture because they cannot
 possibly be interpreted from a material standpoint To
54621 the author they are transparent for they contain the deep
 divinity of the Bible

 Dawning of spiritual facts

 Christian Science is dawning upon a material age
54624 The great spiritual facts of being like rays of light shine
 in the darkness though the darkness com
 prehending them not may deny their reality
54627 The proof that the system stated in this book is Chris
 tianly scientific resides in the good this system accom
 plishes for it cures on a divine demonstrable Principle
54630 which all may understand

 Proof given in healing

 If mathematics should present a thousand different
 examples of one rule the proving of one example would
5471 authenticate all the others A simple statement of Chris
 tian Science if demonstrated by healing contains the
5473 proof of all here said of Christian Science If
 one of the statements in this book is true every
 one must be true for not one departs from the stated sys
5476 tem and rule You can prove for yourself dear reader
 the Science of healing and so ascertain if the author has
 given you the correct interpretation of Scripture

 Embryonic evolution

5479 The late Louis Agassiz by his microscopic examination
 of a vultures ovum strengthens the thinkers conclusions
 as to the scientific theory of creation Agassiz
54712 was able to see in the egg the earths atmos
 phere the gathering clouds the moon and stars while the
 germinating speck of socalled embryonic life seemed a
54715 small sun In its history of mortality Darwins theory
 of evolution from a material basis is more consistent than
 most theories Briefly this is Darwins theory  that
54718 Mind produces its opposite matter and endues matter
 with power to recreate the universe including man Ma
 terial evolution implies that the great First Cause must
54721 become material and afterwards must either return to
 Mind or go down into dust and nothingness

 True theory of the universe

 The Scriptures are very sacred Our aim must be to
54724 have them understood spiritually for only by this under
 standing can truth be gained The true the
 ory of the universe including man is not in
54727 material history but in spiritual development
 Inspired thought relinquishes a material sensual and
 mortal theory of the universe and adopts the spiritual and
54730 immortal

 Scriptural perception

 It is this spiritual perception of Scripture which lifts
 humanity out of disease and death and inspires faith
5481 The Spirit and the bride say Come    and whoso
 ever will let him take the water of life freely Christian
5483 Science separates error from truth and breathes
 through the sacred pages the spiritual sense of
 life substance and intelligence In this Science we dis
5486 cover man in the image and likeness of God We see that
 man has never lost his spiritual estate and his eternal
 harmony

 The clouds dissolving

5489 How little light or heat reach our earth when clouds
 cover the suns face So Christian Science can be seen
 only as the clouds of corporeal sense roll away
54812 Earth has little light or joy for mortals before
 Life is spiritually learned Every agony of mortal error
 helps error to destroy error and so aids the apprehension
54815 of immortal Truth This is the new birth going on
 hourly by which men may entertain angels the true
 ideas of God the spiritual sense of being

 Prediction of a naturalist

54818 Speaking of the origin of mortals a famous naturalist
 says It is very possible that many general statements
 now current about birth and generation will
54821 be changed with the progress of information
 Had the naturalist through his tireless researches gained
 the diviner side in Christian Science  so far apart from
54824 his material sense of animal growth and organization 
 he would have blessed the human race more abundantly

 Methods of reproduction

 Natural history is richly endowed by the labors and
54827 genius of great men Modern discoveries have brought
 to light important facts in regard to socalled
 embryonic life Agassiz declares Methods
54830 of Study in Natural History Certain ani
 mals besides the ordinary process of generation also
 increase their numbers naturally and constantly by self
5491 division This discovery is corroborative of the Science
 of Mind for this discovery shows that the multiplication
5493 of certain animals takes place apart from sexual condi
 tions The supposition that life germinates in eggs and
 must decay after it has grown to maturity if not before
5496 is shown by divine metaphysics to be a mistake  a
 blunder which will finally give place to higher theories
 and demonstrations

 The three processes

5499 Creatures of lower forms of organism are supposed
 to have as classes three different methods of reproduc
 tion and to multiply their species sometimes
54912 through eggs sometimes through buds and
 sometimes through selfdivision According to recent
 lore successive generations do not begin with the birth of
54915 new individuals or personalities but with the formation
 of the nucleus or egg from which one or more individu
 alities subsequently emerge and we must therefore look
54918 upon the simple ovum as the germ the startingpoint of
 the most complicated corporeal structures including those
 which we call human Here these material researches
54921 culminate in such vague hypotheses as must necessarily
 attend false systems which rely upon physics and are de
 void of metaphysics

 Deference to material law

54924 In one instance a celebrated naturalist Agassiz dis
 covers the pathway leading to divine Science and beards
 the lion of materialism in its den At that
54927 point however even this great observer mis
 takes nature forsakes Spirit as the divine origin of
 creative Truth and allows matter and material law to
54930 usurp the prerogatives of omnipotence He absolutely
 drops from his summit coming down to a belief in the
 material origin of man for he virtually affirms that
5501 the germ of humanity is in a circumscribed and non
 intelligent egg

 Deepreaching interrogations

5503 If this be so whence cometh Life or Mind to the
 human race Matter surely does not possess Mind
 God is the Life or intelligence which forms
5506 and preserves the individuality and identity
 of animals as well as of men God cannot
 become finite and be limited within material bounds
5509 Spirit cannot become matter nor can Spirit be developed
 through its opposite Of what avail is it to investigate
 what is miscalled material life which ends even as it be
55012 gins in nameless nothingness The true sense of being
 and its eternal perfection should appear now even as it
 will hereafter

 Stages of existence

55015 Error of thought is reflected in error of action The
 continual contemplation of existence as material and cor
 poreal  as beginning and ending and with
55018 birth decay and dissolution as its component
 stages  hides the true and spiritual Life and causes
 our standard to trail in the dust If Life has any starting
55021 point whatsoever then the great I AM is a myth If Life
 is God as the Scriptures imply then Life is not embry
 onic it is infinite An egg is an impossible enclosure for
55024 Deity

 Embryology supplies no instance of one species pro
 ducing its opposite A serpent never begets a bird nor
55027 does a lion bring forth a lamb Amalgamation is deemed
 monstrous and is seldom fruitful but it is not so hideous
 and absurd as the supposition that Spirit  the pure and
55030 holy the immutable and immortal  can originate the
 impure and mortal and dwell in it As Christian Science
 repudiates selfevident impossibilities the material senses
5511 must father these absurdities for both the material senses
 and their reports are unnatural impossible and unreal

 The real producer

5513 Either Mind produces or it is produced If Mind is
 first it cannot produce its opposite in quality and quantity
 called matter If matter is first it cannot pro
5516 duce Mind Like produces like In natural
 history the bird is not the product of a beast In spiritual
 history matter is not the progenitor of Mind

 The ascent of species

5519 One distinguished naturalist argues that mortals spring
 from eggs and in races Mr Darwin admits this but he
 adds that mankind has ascended through all
55112 the lower grades of existence Evolution de
 scribes the gradations of human belief but it does not
 acknowledge the method of divine Mind nor see that ma
55115 terial methods are impossible in divine Science and that
 all Science is of God not of man

 Transmitted peculiarities

 Naturalists ask What can there be of a material
55118 nature transmitted through these bodies called eggs 
 themselves composed of the simplest material
 elements  by which all peculiarities of an
55121 cestry belonging to either sex are brought down from
 generation to generation The question of the natu
 ralist amounts to this How can matter originate or trans
55124 mit mind We answer that it cannot Darkness and
 doubt encompass thought so long as it bases creation on
 materiality From a material standpoint Canst thou
55127 by searching find out God All must be Mind or
 else all must be matter Neither can produce the other
 Mind is immortal but error declares that the material
55130 seed must decay in order to propagate its species and
 the resulting germ is doomed to the same routine

 Causation not in matter

 The ancient and hypothetical question Which is first
5521 the egg or the bird is answered if the egg produces the
 parent But we cannot stop here Another question
5523 follows Who or what produces the parent of
 the egg That the earth was hatched from the
 egg of night was once an accepted theory Heathen
5526 philosophy modern geology and all other material hy
 potheses deal with causation as contingent on matter
 and as necessarily apparent to the corporeal senses even
5529 where the proof requisite to sustain this assumption is un
 discovered Mortal theories make friends of sin sickness
 and death whereas the spiritual scientific facts of exist
55212 ence include no member of this dolorous and fatal triad

 Emergence of mortals

 Human experience in mortal life which starts from an
 egg corresponds with that of Job when he says Man
55215 that is born of a woman is of few days and
 full of trouble Mortals must emerge from
 this notion of material life as allinall They must peck
55218 open their shells with Christian Science and look outward
 and upward But thought loosened from a material
 basis but not yet instructed by Science may become wild
55221 with freedom and so be selfcontradictory

 Persistence of species

 From a material source flows no remedy for sorrow
 sin and death for the redeeming power from the ills
55224 they occasion is not in egg nor in dust The
 blending tints of leaf and flower show the
 order of matter to be the order of mortal mind The
55227 intermixture of different species urged to its utmost
 limits results in a return to the original species Thus
 it is learned that matter is a manifestation of mortal
55230 mind and that matter always surrenders its claims when
 the perfect and eternal Mind is understood

 Better basis than embryology

 Naturalists describe the origin of mortal and material
5531 existence in the various forms of embryology and ac
 company their descriptions with important observations
5533 which should awaken thought to a higher and
 purer contemplation of mans origin This
 clearer consciousness must precede an under
5536 standing of the harmony of being Mortal thought must
 obtain a better basis get nearer the truth of being or
 health will never be universal and harmony will never
5539 become the standard of man

 One of our ablest naturalists has said We have no
 right to assume that individuals have grown or been
55312 formed under circumstances which made material con
 ditions essential to their maintenance and reproduction
 or important to their origin and first introduction
55315 Why then is the naturalists basis so materialistic
 and why are his deductions generally material

 All nativity in thought

 Adam was created before Eve In this instance it is
55318 seen that the maternal egg never brought forth Adam
 Eve was formed from Adams rib not from a
 foetal ovum Whatever theory may be adopted
55321 by general mortal thought to account for human origin
 that theory is sure to become the signal for the appear
 ance of its method in finite forms and operations If con
55324 sentaneous human belief agrees upon an ovum as the
 point of emergence for the human race this potent belief
 will immediately supersede the more ancient supersti
55327 tion about the creation from dust or from the rib of our
 primeval father

 Being is immortal

 You may say that mortals are formed before they
55330 think or know aught of their origin and you
 may also ask how belief can affect a result
 which precedes the development of that belief It can
5541 only be replied that Christian Science reveals what eye
 hath not seen  even the cause of all that exists  for
5543 the universe inclusive of man is as eternal as God who
 is its divine immortal Principle There is no such thing
 as mortality nor are there properly any mortal beings
5546 because being is immortal like Deity  or rather being
 and Deity are inseparable

 Our conscious development

 Error is always error It is no thing Any statement
5549 of life following from a misconception of life is errone
 ous because it is destitute of any knowledge
 of the socalled selfhood of life destitute of
55412 any knowledge of its origin or existence The mortal
 is unconscious of his foetal and infantile existence but
 as he grows up into another false claim that of selfcon
55415 scious matter he learns to say I am somebody but
 who made me Error replies God made you The
 first effort of error has been and is to impute to God the
55418 creation of whatever is sinful and mortal but infinite
 Mind sets at naught such a mistaken belief

 Mendacity of error

 Jesus defined this opposite of God and His creation
55421 better than we can when he said He is a liar and the
 father of it Jesus also said Have not I
 chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil
55424 This he said of Judas one of Adams race Jesus never
 intimated that God made a devil but he did say Ye
 are of your father the devil All these sayings were to
55427 show that mind in matter is the author of itself and is
 simply a falsity and illusion

 Ailments of animals

 It is the general belief that the lower animals are less
55430 sickly than those possessing higher organiza
 tions especially those of the human form
 This would indicate that there is less disease in propor
5551 tion as the force of mortal mind is less pungent or sensi
 tive and that health attends the absence of mortal mind
5553 A fair conclusion from this might be that it is the human
 belief and not the divine arbitrament which brings the
 physical organism under the yoke of disease

 Ignorance the sign of error

5556 An inquirer once said to the discoverer of Christian
 Science I like your explanations of truth but I do
 not comprehend what you say about error
5559 This is the nature of error The mark of igno
 rance is on its forehead for it neither understands nor
 can be understood Error would have itself received as
55512 mind as if it were as real and Godcreated as truth but
 Christian Science attributes to error neither entity nor
 power because error is neither mind nor the outcome of
55515 Mind

 The origin of divinity

 Searching for the origin of man who is the reflection
 of God is like inquiring into the origin of God the self
55518 existent and eternal Only impotent error
 would seek to unite Spirit with matter good
 with evil immortality with mortality and call this
55521 sham unity man as if man were the offspring of both
 Mind and matter of both Deity and humanity Crea
 tion rests on a spiritual basis We lose our standard of
55524 perfection and set aside the proper conception of Deity
 when we admit that the perfect is the author of aught
 that can become imperfect that God bestows the power
55527 to sin or that Truth confers the ability to err Our
 great example Jesus could restore the individualized
 manifestation of existence which seemed to vanish in
55530 death Knowing that God was the Life of man Jesus
 was able to present himself unchanged after the cruci
 fixion Truth fosters the idea of Truth and not the be
5561 lief in illusion or error That which is real is sustained
 by Spirit

 Genera classified

5563 Vertebrata articulata mollusca and radiata are mor
 tal and material concepts classified and are supposed to
 possess life and mind These false beliefs
5566 will disappear when the radiation of Spirit
 destroys forever all belief in intelligent matter Then
 will the new heaven and new earth appear for the for
5569 mer things will have passed away

 The Christians privilege

 Mortal belief infolds the conditions of sin Mortal
 belief dies to live again in renewed forms only to go out
55612 at last forever for life everlasting is not to be
 gained by dying Christian Science may ab
 sorb the attention of sage and philosopher but
55615 the Christian alone can fathom it It is made known
 most fully to him who understands best the divine Life
 Did the origin and the enlightenment of the race come
55618 from the deep sleep which fell upon Adam Sleep is
 darkness but Gods creative mandate was Let there be
 light In sleep cause and effect are mere illusions
55621 They seem to be something but are not Oblivion and
 dreams not realities come with sleep Even so goes on
 the Adambelief of which mortal and material life is the
55624 dream

 Ontology versus physiology

 Ontology receives less attention than physiology Why
 Because mortal mind must waken to spiritual
55627 life before it cares to solve the problem of
 being hence the authors experience but when
 that awakening comes existence will be on a new stand
55630 point

 It is related that a father plunged his infant babe only
 a few hours old into the water for several minutes and
5571 repeated this operation daily until the child could remain
 under water twenty minutes moving and playing with
5573 out harm like a fish Parents should remember this
 and learn how to develop their children properly on dry
 land

 The curse removed

5576 Mind controls the birththroes in the lower realms of
 nature where parturition is without suffering Vege
 tables minerals and many animals suffer no
5579 pain in multiplying but human propagation
 has its suffering because it is a false belief Christian Sci
 ence reveals harmony as proportionately increasing as the
55712 line of creation rises towards spiritual man  towards
 enlarged understanding and intelligence but in the line
 of the corporeal senses the less a mortal knows of sin
55715 disease and mortality the better for him  the less pain
 and sorrow are his When the mist of mortal mind evap
 orates the curse will be removed which says to woman
55718 In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children Divine
 Science rolls back the clouds of error with the light of
 Truth and lifts the curtain on man as never born and as
55721 never dying but as coexistent with his creator

 Popular theology takes up the history of man as if he
 began materially right but immediately fell into mental
55724 sin whereas revealed religion proclaims the Science of
 Mind and its formations as being in accordance with
 the first chapter of the Old Testament when God Mind
55727 spake and it was done




 CHAPTER XVI  THE APOCALYPSE

 Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of
 this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein
 for the time is at hand  REVELATION

 Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of
 our God in the mountain of His holiness  PSALMS

5581 ST JOHN writes in the tenth chapter of his book of
 Revelation 

5583 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven
 clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and
 his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of
5586 fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he
 set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the
 earth

 The new Evangel

5589 This angel or message which comes from God clothed
 with a cloud prefigures divine Science To mortal sense
 Science seems at first obscure abstract and
55812 dark but a bright promise crowns its brow
 When understood it is Truths prism and praise When
 you look it fairly in the face you can heal by its means
55815 and it has for you a light above the sun for God is the
 light thereof Its feet are pillars of fire foundations
 of Truth and Love It brings the baptism of the Holy
55818 Ghost whose flames of Truth were prophetically de
 scribed by John the Baptist as consuming error

 Truths volume

5591 This angel had in his hand a little book open for
 all to read and understand Did this same book contain
5593 the revelation of divine Science the right
 foot or dominant power of which was upon
 the sea  upon elementary latent error the source of
5596 all errors visible forms The angels left foot was upon
 the earth that is a secondary power was exercised upon
 visible error and audible sin The still small voice
5599 of scientific thought reaches over continent and ocean
 to the globes remotest bound The inaudible voice of
 Truth is to the human mind as when a lion roareth
55912 It is heard in the desert and in dark places of fear It
 arouses the seven thunders of evil and stirs their latent
 forces to utter the full diapason of secret tones Then is
55915 the power of Truth demonstrated  made manifest in
 the destruction of error Then will a voice from harmony
 cry Go and take the little book    Take it and eat
55918 it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
 thy mouth sweet as honey Mortals obey the heavenly
 evangel Take divine Science Read this book from
55921 beginning to end Study it ponder it It will be indeed
 sweet at its first taste when it heals you but murmur not
 over Truth if you find its digestion bitter When you
55924 approach nearer and nearer to this divine Principle when
 you eat the divine body of this Principle  thus partak
 ing of the nature or primal elements of Truth and Love
55927  do not be surprised nor discontented because you must
 share the hemlock cup and eat the bitter herbs for the
 Israelites of old at the Paschal meal thus prefigured this
55930 perilous passage out of bondage into the El Dorado of faith
 and hope

 Todays lesson

 The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse or Revela
5601 tion of St John has a special suggestiveness in connec
 tion with the nineteenth century In the opening of the
5603 sixth seal typical of six thousand years since
 Adam the distinctive feature has reference
 to the present age

5606 Revelation xii 1 And there appeared a great wonder in
 heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon
 under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve
5609 stars

 True estimate of Gods messenger

 Heaven represents harmony and divine Science inter
 prets the Principle of heavenly harmony The great
56012 miracle to human sense is divine Love and
 the grand necessity of existence is to gain the
 true idea of what constitutes the kingdom of
56015 heaven in man This goal is never reached while we
 hate our neighbor or entertain a false estimate of any
 one whom God has appointed to voice His Word Again
56018 without a correct sense of its highest visible idea we can
 never understand the divine Principle The botanist must
 know the genus and species of a plant in order to classify
56021 it correctly As it is with things so is it with persons

 Persecution harmful

 Abuse of the motives and religion of St Paul hid from
 view the apostles character which made him equal to
56024 his great mission Persecution of all who have
 spoken something new and better of God has
 not only obscured the light of the ages but has been fatal
56027 to the persecutors Why Because it has hid from
 them the true idea which has been presented To mis
 understand Paul was to be ignorant of the divine idea he
56030 taught Ignorance of the divine idea betrays at once a
 greater ignorance of the divine Principle of the idea  igno
5611 rance of Truth and Love The understanding of Truth
 and Love the Principle which works out the ends of eternal
5613 good and destroys both faith in evil and the practice of
 evil leads to the discernment of the divine idea

 Espousals supernal

 Agassiz through his microscope saw the sun in an
5616 egg at a point of socalled embryonic life Because of
 his more spiritual vision St John saw an
 angel standing in the sun The Revelator
5619 beheld the spiritual idea from the mount of vision
 Purity was the symbol of Life and Love The Revelator
 saw also the spiritual ideal as a woman clothed in light a
56112 bride coming down from heaven wedded to the Lamb
 of Love To John the bride and the Lamb repre
 sented the correlation of divine Principle and spiritual idea
56115 God and His Christ bringing harmony to earth

 Divinity and humanity

 John saw the human and divine coincidence shown in
 the man Jesus as divinity embracing humanity in Life
56118 and its demonstration  reducing to human
 perception and understanding the Life which
 is God In divine revelation material and corporeal self
56121 hood disappear and the spiritual idea is understood

 Spiritual sunlight

 The woman in the Apocalypse symbolizes generic man
 the spiritual idea of God she illustrates the coincidence
56124 of God and man as the divine Principle and
 divine idea The Revelator symbolizes Spirit
 by the sun The spiritual idea is clad with the radiance
56127 of spiritual Truth and matter is put under her feet The
 light portrayed is really neither solar nor lunar but spirit
 ual Life which is the light of men In the first chapter
56130 of the Fourth Gospel it is written There was a man sent
 from God    to bear witness of that Light

 Spiritual idea revealed

 John the Baptist prophesied the coming of the im
5621 maculate Jesus and John saw in those days the spiritual
 idea as the Messiah who would baptize with the Holy
5623 Ghost divine Science As Elias presented
 the idea of the fatherhood of God which Jesus
 afterwards manifested so the Revelator completed this
5626 figure with woman typifying the spiritual idea of Gods
 motherhood The moon is under her feet This idea
 reveals the universe as secondary and tributary to Spirit
5629 from which the universe borrows its reflected light sub
 stance life and intelligence

 Spiritual idea crowned

 The spiritual idea is crowned with twelve stars The
56212 twelve tribes of Israel with all mortals  separated by
 belief from mans divine origin and the true
 idea  will through much tribulation yield to
56215 the activities of the divine Principle of man in the har
 mony of Science These are the stars in the crown of
 rejoicing They are the lamps in the spiritual heavens
56218 of the age which show the workings of the spiritual idea
 by healing the sick and the sinning and by manifesting
 the light which shines unto the perfect day as the night
56221 of materialism wanes

 Revelation xii 2 And she being with child cried travail
 ing in birth and pained to be delivered

 Travail and joy

56224 Also the spiritual idea is typified by a woman in tra
 vail waiting to be delivered of her sweet promise but re
 membering no more her sorrow for joy that
56227 the birth goes on for great is the idea and the
 travail portentous

 Revelation xii 3 And there appeared another wonder in
56230 heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads
 and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads

 The dragon as a type

5631 Human sense may well marvel at discord while to a
 diviner sense harmony is the real and discord the unreal
5633 We may well be astonished at sin sickness and
 death We may well be perplexed at human
 fear and still more astounded at hatred which lifts
5636 its hydra head showing its horns in the many inventions
 of evil But why should we stand aghast at nothingness
 The great red dragon symbolizes a lie  the belief
5639 that substance life and intelligence can be material
 This dragon stands for the sum total of human error
 The ten horns of the dragon typify the belief that mat
56312 ter has power of its own and that by means of an
 evil mind in matter the Ten Commandments can be
 broken

 The sting of the serpent

56315 The Revelator lifts the veil from this embodiment of
 all evil and beholds its awful character but he also
 sees the nothingness of evil and the allness of
56318 God The Revelator sees that old serpent
 whose name is devil or evil holding untiring watch that
 he may bite the heel of truth and seemingly impede the
56321 offspring of the spiritual idea which is prolific in health
 holiness and immortality

 Revelation xii 4 And his tail drew the third part of the
56324 stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the
 dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be
 delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born

 Animal tendency

56327 The serpentine form stands for subtlety winding its
 way amidst all evil but doing this in the name of good
 Its sting is spoken of by Paul when he refers
56330 to spiritual wickedness in high places It
 is the animal instinct in mortals which would impel
5641 them to devour each other and cast out devils through
 Beelzebub

5643 As of old evil still charges the spiritual idea with errors
 own nature and methods This malicious animal in
 stinct of which the dragon is the type incites mortals to
5646 kill morally and physically even their fellowmortals and
 worse still to charge the innocent with the crime This
 last infirmity of sin will sink its perpetrator into a night
5649 without a star

 Malicious barbarity

 The author is convinced that the accusations against
 Jesus of Nazareth and even his crucifixion were instigated
56412 by the criminal instinct here described The
 Revelator speaks of Jesus as the Lamb of God
 and of the dragon as warring against innocence Since Jesus
56415 must have been tempted in all points he the immaculate
 met and conquered sin in every form The brutal bar
 barity of his foes could emanate from no source except the
56418 highest degree of human depravity Jesus opened not
 his mouth Until the majesty of Truth should be demon
 strated in divine Science the spiritual idea was arraigned
56421 before the tribunal of socalled mortal mind which was
 unloosed in order that the false claim of mind in matter
 might uncover its own crime of defying immortal Mind

 Doom of the dragon

56424 From Genesis to the Apocalypse sin sickness and
 death envy hatred and revenge  all evil  are typi
 fied by a serpent or animal subtlety Jesus
56427 said quoting a line from the Psalms They
 hated me without a cause The serpent is perpetually
 close upon the heel of harmony From the beginning
56430 to the end the serpent pursues with hatred the spiritual
 idea In Genesis this allegorical talking serpent typi
 fies mortal mind more subtle than any beast of the
5651 field In the Apocalypse when nearing its doom this
 evil increases and becomes the great red dragon swollen
5653 with sin inflamed with war against spirituality and ripe
 for destruction It is full of lust and hate loathing the
 brightness of divine glory

5656 Revelation xii 5 And she brought forth a man child
 who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her
 child was caught up unto God and to His throne

 The conflict with purity

5659 Led on by the grossest element of mortal mind Herod
 decreed the death of every male child in order that the
 man Jesus the masculine representative of the
56512 spiritual idea might never hold sway and de
 prive Herod of his crown The impersonation of the
 spiritual idea had a brief history in the earthly life of our
56515 Master but of his kingdom there shall be no end
 for Christ Gods idea will eventually rule all nations
 and peoples  imperatively absolutely finally  with di
56518 vine Science This immaculate idea represented first
 by man and according to the Revelator last by woman
 will baptize with fire and the fiery baptism will burn up
56521 the chaff of error with the fervent heat of Truth and Love
 melting and purifying even the gold of human character
 After the stars sang together and all was primeval har
56524 mony the material lie made war upon the spiritual idea
 but this only impelled the idea to rise to the zenith of
 demonstration destroying sin sickness and death and
56527 to be caught up unto God  to be found in its divine
 Principle

 Revelation xii 6 And the woman fled into the wilder
56530 ness where she hath a place prepared of God

 Spiritual guidance

5661 As the children of Israel were guided triumphantly
 through the Red Sea the dark ebbing and flowing tides
5663 of human fear  as they were led through the
 wilderness walking wearily through the great
 desert of human hopes and anticipating the promised
5666 joy  so shall the spiritual idea guide all right desires
 in their passage from sense to Soul from a material sense
 of existence to the spiritual up to the glory prepared for
5669 them who love God Stately Science pauses not but
 moves before them a pillar of cloud by day and of fire
 by night leading to divine heights

56612 If we remember the beautiful description which Sir
 Walter Scott puts into the mouth of Rebecca the Jewess
 in the story of Ivanhoe 
56615 When Israel of the Lord beloved
 Out of the land of bondage came
 Her fathers God before her moved
56618 An awful guide in smoke and flame 

 we may also offer the prayer which concludes the same
 hymn 
56621 And oh when stoops on Judahs path
 In shade and storm the frequent night
 Be Thou longsuffering slow to wrath
56624 A burning and a shining light

 Revelation xii 7 8 And there was war in heaven
 Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the
56627 dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither
 was their place found any more in heaven

 Angelic offices

 The Old Testament assigns to the angels Gods divine
56630 messages different offices Michaels charac
 teristic is spiritual strength He leads the
 hosts of heaven against the power of sin Satan and
5671 fights the holy wars Gabriel has the more quiet task
 of imparting a sense of the everpresence of ministering
5673 Love These angels deliver us from the depths Truth
 and Love come nearer in the hour of woe when strong
 faith or spiritual strength wrestles and prevails through
5676 the understanding of God The Gabriel of His presence
 has no contests To infinite everpresent Love all is
 Love and there is no error no sin sickness nor death
5679 Against Love the dragon warreth not long for he is
 killed by the divine Principle Truth and Love prevail
 against the dragon because the dragon cannot war with
56712 them Thus endeth the conflict between the flesh and
 Spirit

 Revelation xii 9 And the great dragon was cast out
56715 that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiv
 eth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his
 angels were cast out with him

 Dragon cast down to earth

56718 That false claim  that ancient belief that old serpent
 whose name is devil evil claiming that there is intelli
 gence in matter either to benefit or to injure
56721 men  is pure delusion the red dragon and
 it is cast out by Christ Truth the spiritual
 idea and so proved to be powerless The words cast
56724 unto the earth show the dragon to be nothingness dust
 to dust and therefore in his pretence of being a talker
 he must be a lie from the beginning His angels or mes
56727 sages are cast out with their author The beast and the
 false prophets are lust and hypocrisy These wolves in
 sheeps clothing are detected and killed by innocence the
56730 Lamb of Love

 Warfare with error

 Divine Science shows how the Lamb slays the wolf
5681 Innocence and Truth overcome guilt and error Ever
 since the foundation of the world ever since error would
5683 establish material belief evil has tried to slay
 the Lamb but Science is able to destroy this
 lie called evil The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse
5686 typifies the divine method of warfare in Science and the
 glorious results of this warfare The following chapters
 depict the fatal effects of trying to meet error with error
5689 The narrative follows the order used in Genesis In
 Genesis first the true method of creation is set forth and
 then the false Here also the Revelator first exhibits
56812 the true warfare and then the false

 Revelation xii 10  12 And I heard a loud voice saying
 in heaven Now is come salvation and strength and the
56815 kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the
 accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them
 before our God day and night And they overcame him by
56818 the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony
 and they loved not their lives unto the death Therefore
 rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them Woe to the
56821 inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is
 come down unto you having great wrath because he
 knoweth that he hath but a short time

 Paean of jubilee

56824 For victory over a single sin we give thanks and mag
 nify the Lord of Hosts What shall we say of the mighty
 conquest over all sin A louder song sweeter
56827 than has ever before reached high heaven
 now rises clearer and nearer to the great heart of Christ
 for the accuser is not there and Love sends forth her
56830 primal and everlasting strain Selfabnegation by which
 we lay down all for Truth or Christ in our warfare against
 error is a rule in Christian Science This rule clearly
5691 interprets God as divine Principle  as Life represented
 by the Father as Truth represented by the Son as Love
5693 represented by the Mother Every mortal at some period
 here or hereafter must grapple with and overcome the
 mortal belief in a power opposed to God

 The robe of Science

5696 The Scripture Thou hast been faithful over a few
 things I will make thee ruler over many is literally ful
 filled when we are conscious of the supremacy
5699 of Truth by which the nothingness of error
 is seen and we know that the nothingness of error is in
 proportion to its wickedness He that touches the hem
56912 of Christs robe and masters his mortal beliefs animality
 and hate rejoices in the proof of healing  in a sweet
 and certain sense that God is Love Alas for those who
56915 break faith with divine Science and fail to strangle the
 serpent of sin as well as of sickness They are dwellers
 still in the deep darkness of belief They are in the surg
56918 ing sea of error not struggling to lift their heads above the
 drowning wave

 Expiation by suffering

 What must the end be They must eventually expi
56921 ate their sin through suffering The sin which one has
 made his bosom companion comes back to him
 at last with accelerated force for the devil
56924 knoweth his time is short Here the Scriptures declare
 that evil is temporal not eternal The dragon is at last
 stung to death by his own malice but how many periods
56927 of torture it may take to remove all sin must depend upon
 sins obduracy

 Revelation xii 13 And when the dragon saw that he
56930 was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which
 brought forth the man child

 Apathy to occultism

5701 The march of mind and of honest investigation will
 bring the hour when the people will chain with fetters of
5703 some sort the growing occultism of this period
 The present apathy as to the tendency of
 certain active yet unseen mental agencies will finally be
5706 shocked into another extreme mortal mood  into human
 indignation for one extreme follows another

 Revelation xii 15 16 And the serpent cast out of his
5709 mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might
 cause her to be carried away of the flood And the earth
 helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and
57012 swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his
 mouth

 Receptive hearts

 Millions of unprejudiced minds  simple seekers for
57015 Truth weary wanderers athirst in the desert  are wait
 ing and watching for rest and drink Give
 them a cup of cold water in Christs name
57018 and never fear the consequences What if the old dragon
 should send forth a new flood to drown the Christidea
 He can neither drown your voice with its roar nor again
57021 sink the world into the deep waters of chaos and old night
 In this age the earth will help the woman the spiritual
 idea will be understood Those ready for the blessing
57024 you impart will give thanks The waters will be paci
 fied and Christ will command the wave

 Hidden ways of iniquity

 When God heals the sick or the sinning they should
57027 know the great benefit which Mind has wrought They
 should also know the great delusion of mor
 tal mind when it makes them sick or sinful
57030 Many are willing to open the eyes of the people to the
 power of good resident in divine Mind but they are
5711 not so willing to point out the evil in human thought
 and expose evils hidden mental ways of accomplishing
5713 iniquity

 Christly warning

 Why this backwardness since exposure is necessary
 to ensure the avoidance of the evil Because people like
5716 you better when you tell them their virtues
 than when you tell them their vices It re
 quires the spirit of our blessed Master to tell a man his
5719 faults and so risk human displeasure for the sake of doing
 right and benefiting our race Who is telling mankind
 of the foe in ambush Is the informer one who sees the
57112 foe If so listen and be wise Escape from evil and
 designate those as unfaithful stewards who have seen the
 danger and yet have given no warning

 The armor of divinity

57115 At all times and under all circumstances overcome
 evil with good Know thyself and God will supply
 the wisdom and the occasion for a victory
57118 over evil Clad in the panoply of Love
 human hatred cannot reach you The cement of a
 higher humanity will unite all interests in the one
57121 divinity

 Pure religion enthroned


 Through trope and metaphor the Revelator immortal
 scribe of Spirit and of a true idealism furnishes the
57124 mirror in which mortals may see their own
 image In significant figures he depicts the
 thoughts which he beholds in mortal mind Thus he
57127 rebukes the conceit of sin and foreshadows its doom
 With his spiritual strength he has opened wide the gates
 of glory and illumined the night of paganism with the
57130 sublime grandeur of divine Science outshining sin sorcery
 lust and hypocrisy He takes away mitre and sceptre
 He enthrones pure and undefiled religion and lifts on
5721 high only those who have washed their robes white in
 obedience and suffering

 Native nothingness of sin

5723 Thus we see in both the first and last books of the
 Bible  in Genesis and in the Apocalypse  that sin
 is to be Christianly and scientifically reduced
5726 to its native nothingness Love one an
 other I John iii 23 is the most simple and profound
 counsel of the inspired writer In Science we are chil
5729 dren of God but whatever is of material sense or mor
 tal belongs not to His children for materiality is the
 inverted image of spirituality

 Fulfilment of the Law

57212 Love fulfils the law of Christian Science and nothing
 short of this divine Principle understood and demon
 strated can ever furnish the vision of the
57215 Apocalypse open the seven seals of error with
 Truth or uncover the myriad illusions of sin sickness
 and death Under the supremacy of Spirit it will be seen
57218 and acknowledged that matter must disappear

 In Revelation xxi 1 we read 

 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first
57221 heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was
 no more sea

 Mans present possibilities

 The Revelator had not yet passed the transitional
57224 stage in human experience called death but he already
 saw a new heaven and a new earth Through
 what sense came this vision to St John Not
57227 through the material visual organs for seeing for optics
 are inadequate to take in so wonderful a scene Were this
 new heaven and new earth terrestrial or celestial mate
5731 rial or spiritual They could not be the former for the
 human sense of space is unable to grasp such a view
5733 The Revelator was on our plane of existence while yet
 beholding what the eye cannot see  that which is in
 visible to the uninspired thought This testimony of Holy
5736 Writ sustains the fact in Science that the heavens and
 earth to one human consciousness that consciousness
 which God bestows are spiritual while to another the
5739 unillumined human mind the vision is material This
 shows unmistakably that what the human mind terms
 matter and spirit indicates states and stages of con
57312 sciousness

 Nearness of Deity

 Accompanying this scientific consciousness was an
 other revelation even the declaration from heaven su
57315 preme harmony that God the divine Principle
 of harmony is ever with men and they are
 His people Thus man was no longer regarded as a mis
57318 erable sinner but as the blessed child of God Why
 Because St Johns corporeal sense of the heavens and
 earth had vanished and in place of this false sense was
57321 the spiritual sense the subjective state by which he could
 see the new heaven and new earth which involve the
 spiritual idea and consciousness of reality This is Scrip
57324 tural authority for concluding that such a recognition of
 being is and has been possible to men in this present
 state of existence  that we can become conscious
57327 here and now of a cessation of death sorrow and pain
 This is indeed a foretaste of absolute Christian Science
 Take heart dear sufferer for this reality of being will
57330 surely appear sometime and in some way There will
 be no more pain and all tears will be wiped away When
 you read this remember Jesus words The kingdom of
5741 God is within you This spiritual consciousness is
 therefore a present possibility

5743 The Revelator also takes in another view adapted to
 console the weary pilgrim journeying  uphill all the way

 He writes in Revelation xxi 9 

5746 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which
 had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked
 with me saying Come hither I will show thee the bride
5749 the Lambs wife

 Vials of wrath and consolation

 This ministry of Truth this message from divine Love
 carried John away in spirit It exalted him till he be
57412 came conscious of the spiritual facts of being
 and the New Jerusalem coming down from
 God out of heaven  the spiritual outpour
57415 ing of bliss and glory which he describes as the city
 which lieth foursquare The beauty of this text is
 that the sum total of human misery represented by
57418 the seven angelic vials full of seven plagues has full
 compensation in the law of Love Note this  that the
 very message or swiftwinged thought which poured
57421 forth hatred and torment brought also the experience
 which at last lifted the seer to behold the great city the
 four equal sides of which were heavenbestowed and
57424 heavenbestowing

 Spiritual wedlock

 Think of this dear reader for it will lift the sack
 cloth from your eyes and you will behold the soft
57427 winged dove descending upon you The very
 circumstance which your suffering sense
 deems wrathful and afflictive Love can make an angel
57430 entertained unawares Then thought gently whispers
5751 Come hither Arise from your false consciousness
 into the true sense of Love and behold the Lambs
5753 wife  Love wedded to its own spiritual idea Then
 cometh the marriage feast for this revelation will de
 stroy forever the physical plagues imposed by material
5756 sense

 The city foursquare

 This sacred city described in the Apocalypse xxi 16
 as one that lieth foursquare and cometh down from
5759 God out of heaven represents the light and
 glory of divine Science The builder and
 maker of this New Jerusalem is God as we read in the
57512 book of Hebrews and it is a city which hath founda
 tions The description is metaphoric Spiritual teach
 ing must always be by symbols Did not Jesus illustrate
57515 the truths he taught by the mustardseed and the prodi
 gal Taken in its allegorical sense the description of
 the city as foursquare has a profound meaning The
57518 four sides of our city are the Word Christ Christianity
 and divine Science and the gates of it shall not be shut
 at all by day for there shall be no night there This
57521 city is wholly spiritual as its four sides indicate

 The royally divine gates

 As the Psalmist saith Beautiful for situation the
 joy of the whole earth is mount Zion on the sides of
57524 the north the city of the great King It is
 indeed a city of the Spirit fair royal and
 square Northward its gates open to the North Star
57527 the Word the polar magnet of Revelation eastward
 to the star seen by the Wisemen of the Orient who fol
 lowed it to the manger of Jesus southward to the
57530 genial tropics with the Southern Cross in the skies
  the Cross of Calvary which binds human society
 into solemn union westward to the grand realization
5761 of the Golden Shore of Love and the Peaceful Sea of
 Harmony

 Revelations pure zenith

5763 This heavenly city lighted by the Sun of Righteous
 ness  this New Jerusalem this infinite All which to
 us seems hidden in the mist of remoteness 
5766 reached St Johns vision while yet he taber
 nacled with mortals

 In Revelation xxi 22 further describing this holy city
5769 the beloved Disciple writes 

 And I saw no temple therein for the Lord God Almighty
 and the Lamb are the temple of it

 The shrine celestial

57612 There was no temple  that is no material structure
 in which to worship God for He must be worshipped
 in spirit and in love The word temple also
57615 means body The Revelator was familiar
 with Jesus use of this word as when Jesus spoke of his
 material body as the temple to be temporarily rebuilt
57618 John ii 21 What further indication need we of the
 real mans incorporeality than this that John saw
 heaven and earth with no temple body therein
57621 This kingdom of God is within you  is within
 reach of mans consciousness here and the spiritual
 idea reveals it In divine Science man possesses this
57624 recognition of harmony consciously in proportion to his
 understanding of God

 Divine sense of Deity

 The term Lord as used in our version of the Old
57627 Testament is often synonymous with Jehovah and ex
 presses the Jewish concept not yet elevated
 to deific apprehension through spiritual trans
57630 figuration Yet the word gradually approaches a higher
 meaning This human sense of Deity yields to the divine
5771 sense even as the material sense of personality yields
 to the incorporeal sense of God and man as the infinite
5773 Principle and infinite idea  as one Father with His uni
 versal family held in the gospel of Love The Lambs
 wife presents the unity of male and female as no longer
5776 two wedded individuals but as two individual natures
 in one and this compounded spiritual individuality re
 flects God as FatherMother not as a corporeal being
5779 In this divinely united spiritual consciousness there is no
 impediment to eternal bliss  to the perfectibility of
 Gods creation

 The city of our God

57712 This spiritual holy habitation has no boundary
 nor limit but its four cardinal points are first the
 Word of Life Truth and Love second
57715 the Christ the spiritual idea of God third
 Christianity which is the outcome of the divine Prin
 ciple of the Christidea in Christian history fourth
57718 Christian Science which today and forever interprets
 this great example and the great Exemplar This city
 of our God has no need of sun or satellite for Love
57721 is the light of it and divine Mind is its own interpreter
 All who are saved must walk in this light Mighty
 potentates and dynasties will lay down their honors
57724 within the heavenly city Its gates open towards light
 and glory both within and without for all is good and
 nothing can enter that city which defileth    or
57727 maketh a lie

 The writers present feeble sense of Christian Science
 closes with St Johns Revelation as recorded by the
57730 great apostle for his vision is the acme of this Science
 as the Bible reveals it

 In the following Psalm one word shows though faintly
5781 the light which Christian Science throws on the Scriptures
 by substituting for the corporeal sense the incorporeal
5783 or spiritual sense of Deity 

 PSALM XXIII

 DIVINE LOVE is my shepherd I shall not want

5786 LOVE maketh me to lie down in green pastures
 LOVE leadeth me beside the still waters

 LOVE restoreth my soul spiritual sense Love lead
5789 eth me in the paths of righteousness for His names sake

 Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
 death I will fear no evil for LOVE is with me LOVEs
57812 rod and LOVES staff they comfort me

 LOVE prepareth a table before me in the presence of
 mine enemies LOVE anointeth my head with oil my cup
57815 runneth over

 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
 my life and I will dwell in the house the consciousness
57818 of LOVE for ever

  REVELATION

5791 In Christian Science we learn that the substitution of
 the spiritual for the material definition of a Scrip
5793 tural word often elucidates the meaning of the inspired
 writer On this account this chapter is added It con
 tains the metaphysical interpretation of Bible terms
5796 giving their spiritual sense which is also their original
 meaning

 ABEL Watchfulness selfoffering surrendering to
5799 the creator the early fruits of experience

 death the opposite of Love called hate the usurper
58018 of Spirits creation called selfcreative matter immor
 talitys opposite mortality that of which wisdom saith
 Thou shalt surely die

58021 The name Adam represents the false supposition that
 Life is not eternal but has beginning and end that the
 infinite enters the finite that intelligence passes into non
58024 intelligence and that Soul dwells in material sense that
 immortal Mind results in matter and matter in mortal
 mind that the one God and creator entered what He cre
58027 ated and then disappeared in the atheism of matter

 ADVERSARY An adversary is one who opposes denies
 disputes not one who constructs and sustains reality and

 CHRIST The divine manifestation of God which comes
 to the flesh to destroy incarnate error
58312 CHURCH The structure of Truth and Love what
 ever rests upon and proceeds from divine Principle

 The Church is that institution which affords proof of
58315 its utility and is found elevating the race rousing the
 dormant understanding from material beliefs to the ap
 prehension of spiritual ideas and the demonstration of
58318 divine Science thereby casting out devils or error and
 healing the sick

5849 DEATH An illusion the lie of life in matter the un
 real and untrue the opposite of Life

 Matter has no life hence it has no real existence Mind
58412 is immortal The flesh warring against Spirit that

 false for it contradicts the spiritual facts of being

 DEVIL Evil a lie error neither corporeality nor

SOLOMONS SONG

THOUSANDS of letters could be presented in testimony of the healing
efficacy of Christian Science and particularly concerning the vast
number of people who have been reformed and healed through the perusal
or study of this book

For the assurance and encouragement of the reader a few of these
letters are here republished from THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE JOURNAL and
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE SENTINEL The originals are in the possession of the
Editor who can authenticate the testimonials which follow

RHEUMATISM HEALED

I was a great sufferer from a serious form of rheumatic trouble my
hands being affected to such an extent that it was impossible for me
even to dress without assistance The trouble finally reached the knees
and I became very lame and had to be assisted in and out of bed I went
to the different health resorts for the benefit I hoped to derive from
the baths and waters that were prescribed by physicians but found no
permanent relief I was placed under an Xray examination and was told
that the joints were becoming ossified I then consulted a celebrated
specialist who after a thorough examination said my condition would
continue to grow worse and that I would become completely helpless

At that time a copy of Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures
by Mrs Eddy was loaned me I read it more from curiosity than with the
thought of any physical benefit As the truth was unfolded to me I
realized that the mental condition was what needed correcting and that
the Spirit of truth which inspired this book was my physician My
healing is complete and the liberation in thought is manifest in a life
of active usefulness rather than the bondage of helpless invalidism and
suffering I owe to our beloved Leader Mrs Eddy gratitude which words
cannot express Her revelation of the practical rather than the merely
theoretical application of Jesus words Ye shall know the truth and
the truth shall make you free proved to be my redeemer I did not even
have to apply to a practitioner but am most grateful for the helpful
words of loving friends  E B B Pasadena Cal

ASTIGMATISM AND HERNIA HEALED

It is nearly five years since I bought my first copy of Science and
Health the reading of which cured me of chronic constipation nervous
headache astigmatism and hernia in less than four months

Where would I be now had not this blessed truth been brought to me by
much persuasion of a very dear friend

I certainly should have been deep in the slough of despond if not in
the grave Am I truly thankful for all the good that has come to me and
mine I try to let my works testify of that but to those whom I do not
meet in person I can truly say Yes I am indeed more thankful than
words can express for the glorious healing that has come to me both
physical mental and moral and I also convey herein my song of
gratitude to the dear Leader who has through her fidelity to Truth
enabled me to touch at least the hem of Christs garment  B S J

SUBSTANCE OF LUNGS RESTORED

It was about fifteen years ago that Christian Science first
came to my notice At that time I had been a chronic invalid for a good
many years I had acute bowel trouble bronchitis and a number of other
troubles One physician had told me that my lungs were like wet paper ready
to tear at any time and I was filled with fear as my mother two brothers
and a sister had been victims of consumption I tried many physicians and
every material remedy that promised help but no help came until I found
a copy of Mrs Eddys book Science and Health The book was placed in my
hands by one who did not then appreciate it and I was told that it would
be hard for me to understand it I commenced reading it with this thought
but I caught beautiful glimpses of Truth which took away my fear and healed
me of all those diseases and they have never returned

I would also like to tell how I was healed of a sprained ankle The
accident occurred in the morning and all that day and during the night
I gave myself Christian Science treatment as best I could The next
morning it seemed to be no better being very sore badly swollen and
much discolored Feeling that I had done all I could I decided to stop
thinking about it I took my copy of Science and Health and began
reading Very soon I became so absorbed in the book that I forgot all
about my ankle it went entirely out of my thought for I had a glimpse
of all Gods creation as spiritual and for the time being lost sight of
my material selfhood After two hours I laid the book down and walked
into another room When next I thought of my ankle I found it was not
hurting me The swelling had gone down the black and blue appearance
had nearly vanished and it was perfectly well It was healed while I
was absent from the body and present with the Lord This experience
was worth a great deal to me for it showed me how the healing is done

FIBROID TUMOR HEALED IN A FEW DAYS

My gratitude for Christian Science is boundless I was afflicted with a
fibroid tumor which weighed not less than fifty pounds attended by a
continuous hemorrhage for eleven years The tumor was a growth of
eighteen years

I lived in Fort Worth Tex and I had never heard of Christian Science
before leaving there for Chicago in the year 1887 I had tried to live
near to God and I feel sure He guided me in all my steps to this
healing and saving truth After being there several weeks I received
letters from a Texas lady who had herself been healed and who wrote
urging me to try Christian Science

Changing my boardingplace I met a
lady who owned a copy of Science and Health and in speaking to her of
having seen the book she informed me she had one and she got it and
told me I could read it The revelation was marvelous and brought a
great spiritual awakening This awakened sense never left me and one
day when walking alone it came to me very suddenly that I was healed
and I walked the faster declaring every step that I was healed When I
reached my boardingplace I found my hostess and told her I was healed
She looked the picture of amazement The tumor began to disappear at
once the hemorrhage ceased and perfect strength was manifest

There was no joy ever greater than mine for this Christcure for I was
very weary and heavy laden I thought very little of either sleeping or
eating and my heart was filled with gratitude since I knew I had
touched the hem of his garment

I must add that the reading of Science and Health and that alone
healed me and it was the second copy I ever saw  S L Fort Worth
Tex

INSANITY AND EPILEPSY HEALED

While an inmate of the State asylum for the insane at Middletown Conn
an epileptic and at times confined to my bed with bilious attacks
pronounced incurable by the doctors at least six in number the book
Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mrs Eddy was
placed in my hands After reading a few pages I became very much
impressed with the truth therein stated and although I was surrounded
with opposition I knew that underneath are the everlasting arms
Since that time  past the middle of the year 1899  I have kept
pressing on until I have been healed by reading Science and Health At
times I was beset by what seemed unconquerable opposition until the
first week in October 1904 when upon going to my home in Darien for a
visit I was given my liberty and I am now earning my living in this
city After having been subject to epileptic attacks since 1892 and at
one time pronounced dying by the doctor in charge I am now well I have
had no fit or symptoms of any since the first week in May 1904

I trust that this testimony to the healing power of Truth realized by
reading Science and Health for I had no treatment may reach the eye
of some to whom the battle seems long and inspire them with fresh
courage and a realization of the worth of the victory I am filled with
inexpressible gratitude and love to God and to Mrs Eddy  Mrs B B
C Stamford Conn

A CASE OF MENTAL SURGERY

I have felt for some time I should give my experience in mental surgery
In May 1902 going home for lunch on a bicycle and while riding down
a hill at a rapid gait I was thrown from the wheel and falling on my
left side with my arm under my head the bone was broken about halfway
between the shoulder and elbow While the pain was intense I lay still
in the dust declaring the truth and denying that there could be a break
or accident in the realm of divine Love until a gentleman came to
assist me saying he thought I had been stunned I was only two and a
half blocks from home so I mounted my wheel again and managed to reach
it On arriving there I lay down and asked my little boy to bring me our
textbook He immediately brought Science and Health which I read for
about ten minutes when all pain left

I said nothing to my family of the accident but attended to some duties
and was about half an hour late in returning to the office this being
my only loss of time from work My friends claimed that the arm had not
been broken as it would have been impossible for me to continue my work
without having it set and carrying it in a sling until the bone knit
together Their insistence almost persuaded me that I might have been
mistaken until one of my friends invited me to visit a physicians
office where they were experimenting with an Xray machine The
physician was asked to examine my left arm to see if it differed from
the ordinary On looking through it he said Yes it has been broken
but whoever set it made a perfect job of it and you will never have any
further trouble from that break My friend then asked the doctor to
show how he could tell where the break had been The doctor pointed out
the place as being slightly thicker at that part like a piece of steel
that had been welded This was the first of several cases of mental
surgery that have come under my notice and it made a deep impression on
me

For the benefit of others who may have something similar to meet I will
say that I have overcome almost constant attacks of sick headaches
extending back to my earliest recollection  L C S Salt Lake City

CATARACT QUICKLY CURED

I wish to add my testimony to those of others and hope that it may be
the means of bringing some poor sufferer to health to happiness and to
God I was healed through simply reading this wonderful book Science
and Health I had been troubled periodically for many years with sore
eyes and had been to many doctors who called the disease iritis and
cataract They told me that my eyes would always give me trouble and
that I would eventually lose my sight if I remained in an office and
advised me to go under an operation Later on I had to wear glasses at
my work also out of doors as I could not bear the winds and my eyes
were gradually becoming worse I could not read for longer than a few
minutes at a time otherwise they would smart severely I had to rest my
eyes each evening to enable me to use them the next day in fact
gaslight was getting unbearable because of the pain and I made home
miserable A dear brother told me about Christian Science and said that
if I would read Science and Health it would help me He procured for me
the loan of the book The first night I read it it so interested me I
quite forgot all about my eyes until my wife remarked that it was eleven
oclock I found that I had been reading this book for nearly four
hours and I remarked immediately after I believe my eyes are cured
which was really the case The next day on looking at my eyes my wife
noticed that the cataract had disappeared I put away my outdoor
glasses which I have not required since and through the understanding
gained by studying Christian Science I have been able to do away with my
indoor glasses also and have had no return of pain in my eyes since

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE HEALED

Fourteen years ago my heart awoke to gratitude to God and the dear
Leader at the same time After a patient and persistent effort of three
months duration to procure a copy of Science and Health during which
time I had visited every bookstore and many of the secondhand
bookstores in the city of St Paul and had failed to find it I at
last remembered that the stranger who told me I might be healed had
mentioned a name and McVickers Theatre Building in Chicago as being in
some way connected with the work I sent there for information regarding
a book called Health and Science and the return mail brought me the
book Science and Health and in it I at once found sure promise of
deliverance from valvular heart disease with all the accompaniments
such as extreme nervousness weakness dyspepsia and insomnia I had
suffered from these all my life finding no permanent relief even in
material remedies and no hope of cure at any time Only those who have
been healed in such bondage and have been liberated by the same means
can know the eager joy of the first perusal of that wonderful book

Half a days reading convinced me that I had found the way to holiness
and health I read on thinking only of the spiritual enlightenment
content to wait until I should be led to some person who would heal me
but old things had passed away and all things had become new I was
completely healed before I had met a Scientist or one who knew anything
about Christian Science and before I had read a line of any other
Christian Science literature except one leaf of a tract so it is
absolutely certain that the healing was entirely impersonal as was also
the teaching which enabled me to begin at once demonstrating the power
of Truth to destroy all forms of error  E J W North Yakima Wash

THE TRUE PHYSICIAN FOUND

It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I send the particulars of my
healing through Christian Science While visiting friends in the
southwestern part of Ontario about three years ago my attention was
called to Christian Science and the wonderful healing it was doing I
had lived in New York for twentyfive years but had never heard of
Christian Science before to my recollection

Up to that time for seventeen years I had suffered with indigestion
and gastritis in the worst form often being overcome from a seeming
pressure against the heart I had asthma for four years also had worn
glasses for four years It seemed to me that I had swallowed every known
medicine to relieve my indigestion but they only gave me temporary
benefit I purchased a copy of Science and Health and simply from the
reading of that grand book I was completely healed of all my physical
ailments in two weeks time I have used no medicine from that day to
this and with Gods help and the wonderful light revealed to me
through the reading of Mrs Eddys book I never expect to again I used
to smoke eight or ten cigars a day and also took an occasional drink
but the desire for these has gone  I feel forever I travel on the
road and am constantly being invited to indulge but it is no effort to
abstain and in many instances I find that my refusal helps others

While I fully appreciate the release from my physical troubles this
pales into insignificance in comparison with the spiritual uplifting
Christian Science has brought me I had not been inside a church for
more than ten years to attend regular services until I entered a
Christian Science church What I saw and realized there seemed so
genuine that I loved Christian Science from the very start I have never
taken a treatment  every inch of the way has been through study and
practical demonstration and I know that all can do the same thing if
they will try

Since I have been in Science I have overcome a case of ulcerated tooth
in one night through the reading of Science and Health also a severe
attack of grip in thirtysix hours by obeying the Scripture saying
Physician heal thyself  B H N New York N Y

CANCER AND CONSUMPTION HEALED

I was a great sufferer for many years from internal cancer and
consumption I was treated by the best of physicians in New York
Minneapolis and Duluth and was finally given up as incurable when I
heard of Christian Science A neighbor who had been healed of
consumption kindly loaned me Science and Health by Mrs Eddy which I
read and became interested in In three months time I was healed the
truth conveyed to me by this book being the healer and not only of
these diseases but I was made whole mentally as well I have not been
in bed one day since or rather in eleven years I have had many good
demonstrations during this time have passed through many a fiery
trial but this blessed truth has caused me to stand at times
seemingly alone and God was with me

I will mention a demonstration of painless childbirth which I have had
since coming to Idaho Perhaps it may help some sister who is looking
through the Journal for a demonstration of this kind as I was before
my baby came Good help being scarce here I did my housework up to the
time I was confined and was in perfect health I awoke my husband one
morning at five oclock and at half past five baby was born no one
being present but my husband and myself It was quite a surprise to the
rest of the family to see me sitting by the fire with a new baby on my
lap My son got the breakfast of which I ate heartily at noon I joined
the family in the diningroom I was out on the porch the second day
around the yard the third day and have been perfectly well ever since
which has been now over three years To one who had previously passed
through agony untold with a physician in attendance this seemed
wonderful I hope this will interest some one who is seeking the truth
and I wish to express my sincere love for our beloved Leader who has
given us the  Key to the Scriptures  E C C Lewiston Idaho

A REMARKABLE CASE

Nine years ago my only child was hovering between life and death Some
of the best physicians in Boston had pronounced his case incurable
saying that if he lived he would always be an invalid and a cripple One
of the diseases was gastric catarrh He was allowed to eat but very few
things and even after taking every precaution he suffered to the
extent that he would lie in spasms for half a day He also had rickets
physicians saying that there was not a natural bone in his body

It was while he was in what seemed to be his greatest agony and when I
was in the darkest despair that I first heard of Christian Science The
bearer of the joyful tidings could only tell me to come and hear of the
wonderful things that Christian Science was doing I accepted the
invitation for I was willing to try anything to save my child and the
following Friday evening I attended my first meeting which was in The
Mother Church of Christ Scientist Long before the service began every
seat was filled which was amazing to me being an ordinary weekly
meeting and that night I realized from the testimonies given that
Christian Science was the religion for which I had been searching for
years The next day I went to find a practitioner but was unable to get
the one who had been recommended he being too busy On my way home I
thought of some of the testimonies which I had heard the night before 
of people being healed by simply reading Science and Health I resolved at
once to borrow a copy and not dreaming of the sacrifice that my friend
would make by conferring such a favor I went and asked her for a loan of
Science and Health I never saw any one part so reluctantly with a book
as my friend did with her copy of the textbook

I read it silently and audibly day and night in my home and although
I could not seem to understand it yet the healing commenced to take
place at once The little mouth which had been twisted by spasms grew
natural and the child was soon able to be up playing and romping about
the house as any child should About this time we decided to move to the
far West

I was young in Science at the time and my husband greatly feared that
the journey would cause a relapse for the child but instead he
continued to improve I constantly read the Bible Science and Health
and Miscellaneous Writings the two weeks we traveled and we were the
only ones in our car who throughout the journey did not get train
sick The childs limbs grew perfectly straight he ate anything he
wanted and for years he has been a natural healthy child in every way
He has passed through some of the worst forms of contagion untouched and
unharmed

I had been reading Science and Health several months before I gave any
thought to myself and my numerous complaints I had never been very
strong and some of my ailments were supposed to be hereditary and
chronic hence I dragged through many tedious years with a belief in
medical laws and hereditary laws resting upon me

Just before I commenced reading Science and Health I spent a half day in
having my eyes examined by one of the leading oculists in Boston His
verdict was that my eyes were in a dreadful condition and that I would
always need to wear glasses In the meantime I commenced to read Science
and Health and when I thought of my eyes I had no need for glasses
The years that I have been in Science I have used my eyes incessantly
night as well as day doing all kinds of trying work and without
requiring the aid of glasses I was healed of all my complaints whilst
seeking the truth for my child and many of them have never returned
Those that appeared simply came to the surface to be destroyed Teeth
have been restored and facial blemishes removed unconsciously simply
by reading Science and Health All of this is however nothing to
compare with the spiritual uplifting which I have received and I have
everything to be thankful for  M T W Los Angeles Cal

INTENSE SUFFERING OVERCOME

For about five years I was afflicted with sciatic rheumatism in such a
severe form that my body was drawn out of shape When able to be around
I walked with the assistance of a cane The attacks were periodical
recurring every few months any exposure to rain or dampness would bring
one At one time I was in bed eleven weeks suffering intensely all the
time except when relieved by hypodermic injections When I had these
attacks my regular physician was always in attendance My daughter
consulted another physician who said there would have to be an
operation which would include the exposing and scraping of the sciatic
nerve There was also another physician who knowing of the case
examined my heart and claimed that it was weak and that I was liable to
pass on at any time from heart trouble

After suffering three years I heard of Christian Science but did not
avail myself of it for two years when I decided to give up all other
means and rely wholly upon it It was not convenient to call a
practitioner so I took Science and Health and applied its teachings as
best I could In three days the trouble completely left me and there has
never been the slightest return My health has been good ever since and
I am at present in perfect physical health I have been benefited in
every way by Christian Science physically mentally and spiritually
and would not be without my understanding of it for anything  Mrs E
A K Billings Mont

HEALED OF RHEUMATISM AND BRIGHTS DISEASE

I am very thankful to God for what He has done for me I was suddenly
left alone with many troubles and trials and I took up the study of
the Bible I was trying to understand it prior to joining some church
as it seemed to me this would be expected I had attended all sorts of
churches from my childhood up but never could find any that met my
need As time passed on my condition became very alarming Sciatic
rheumatism that had troubled me for some years became so severe I
could scarcely do anything

Then there appeared some complications so distressing that I was unable
to walk far and had to sit down frequently by the way I thought I had
Brights disease  such excruciating pains no tongue could tell my
sufferings With all these things upon me death seemed very near I had
never joined any church and I thought it now too late as I would have
to wait six months on probation and I would be dead before that

About this time I made some inquiries of my sister in reference to
Christian Science as she had already turned to that faith and I soon
found that it was just what I had been looking for I saw at once that
it declared the truth and nothing but the truth I commenced reading
Science and Health also the New Testament I wanted to find out what
Jesus said as I did not expect then to live long I did not go to the
meetings nor did I read Science and Health to be cured  not thinking
of that  but to be saved from an everlasting hell hereafter My sister
urged me to have a practitioner but I kept on reading and praying to
God in silence and what happened Where had the diseases gone I
persisted in reading Science and Health together with the Bible with
the knowledge that God as revealed by Christ Jesus can do everything
that He made everything that was made that He can and does heal the
afflicted He has healed me thanks to His most holy name  G J H

GRATEFUL FOR MANY BLESSINGS

In the year 1901 Christian Science found me a hopeless invalid I had
suffered for seven years previous with a very painful back the result
of an operation I could get no rest or sleep at night as I could not
lie down but had to sit propped in a chair with pillows around me Only
those who have suffered as I did can know the full misery of it I had
come to the end of material means and never hoped to get well One day
however while out walking it was my good fortune to come to a
Christian Scientists house and there the teaching was explained to me
I was advised to buy Science and Health which I did and the study of
this book has healed my back entirely Christian Science has also cured
me of longstanding catarrh of the throat and neuralgia with which I
had been afflicted from childhood Before coming into Science I had
doctored with three of the best physicians in Seattle but none could
give me relief

I am no longer a sufferer but rejoice exceedingly in Christian Science
Gods promise has been fulfilled to me  But unto you that fear my name
shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings  E

FREED FROM NEURASTHENIC AND OTHER TROUBLES

Christian Science found in me a ministers son who had failed to profit
by continuous teaching in the old thought Some years ago I was
pronounced by a professor of materia medica whose works are in
general use a neurasthenic I had been in this condition more or less
for eight years and up to two years ago when Christian Science was
first brought to my attention thanks to Almighty God through a kind
friend I was almost constantly taking medicine and had in all eleven
physicians who undoubtedly did their best but without avail not
withstanding almost all known drugs were prescribed and further I had
tried very many patent medicines I was also put through forms of
hygienic treatment and other things that offered inducements At the
time of coming into Science I was taking three times daily forty minims
of codliver oil and three of creosote also three drops of Fowlers
solution of arsenic and on the month or so previous had bought eighteen
dollars worth of patent medicine I was restricted to the simplest
means of diet  all stews fries sweets berries and tomatoes I had
not touched for two years

I started to read Science and Health and before I had half finished the
book once I was eating everything that any one does I read the book
eleven times straight ahead and many times skipping about The book has
done the work and I am a well man  C E M Philadelphia Pa

MANY ILLS OVERCOME

I have received much help spiritually and physically through Christian
Science I had what the doctors diagnosed as muscular rheumatism
dropsy and constipation of thirty years standing A dear friend whom I
had known as an invalid had been healed by Christian Science and advised
me to read Science and Health I did so having a desire to know the
truth One of my troubles was that I could not sleep I began reading
the Bible and the Christian Science textbook and troubles of every kind
disappeared before I had read Science and Health through The thought
came What about the old remedies but truth prevailed and I took all
the material remedies I had and threw them away That was seven years
ago and I have not had any use for them since My husband was healed of
the tobacco habit of fifty years standing also of kidney trouble by
reading Science and Health I have not words to express the gratitude I
feel today for the many blessings that have come to our home  Mrs M

A HELPFUL HEALING

I became interested in Christian Science about eleven years ago and was
healed of neuralgia of the stomach from which I had suffered from a
child As I grew older the spells became more frequent and more severe
the only relief physicians could give me was by hypodermic injections of
morphine Finally after each spell I would be prostrated for a day or
two with the aftereffect of the morphine I was entirely healed of this
trouble through the study of Science and Health I think I never
realized what fear meant until I began to try and put into practice my
understanding of Christian Science for my children I have proved
however many times that fear can neither help nor hinder in our
demonstration of truth The first time I realized this was in the
overcoming of a severe case of croup for my little boy I was awakened
one night by the sound that seems to bring terror to every mothers
heart and found the little fellow sitting up in bed gasping for
breath I got up took him in my arms and went into the next room My
first thought was O if only there was another Christian Scientist in
town But there was not and the work must be done and done quickly I
tried to treat him but was so frightened I could not think so I picked
up Science and Health which lay on the table beside me and began
reading aloud I had read but a few lines when these words came to me as
though a voice spoke The word of God is quick and powerful and
sharper than any twoedged sword Almost immediately after the little
one said Mamma sing Shepherd   our Leaders hymn that both the
big and the little children love I began singing and commencing with
the second line the little voice joined me I shall never forget the
feeling of joy and peace that came over me when I realized how quickly
Gods word through Science and Health and the beautiful hymn had
accomplished the healing work This is only one of many instances in
which the power of Gods word to heal has been demonstrated in our home

RELIEF FROM MANY ILLS

Paul said Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind In my own
case deafness has been overcome by an enlarged understanding of Gods
word as explained by Mrs Eddy in Science and Health Many times I have
been enabled to turn to God to know it was His will to help in trouble
and obtained the needed benefit Catarrh has disappeared tonsilitis
which very frequently laid me aside from duties in the schoolroom and
home is no longer manifest When temptation comes for Christian
Science is both preventive and curative I turn to that wonderful book
Science and Health and my precious Bible grown dearer since read in
the new light of spiritual understanding until I know that my mind is
renewed because the action is changed and the inflammation has abated

Thus in my experience in Christian Science I have seen the
transformation begun and Truth is able to perfect that which is begun
in me so gloriously  Mrs CA McL Brooklyn Nova Scotia

HEALTH AND PEACE ATTAINED

For fifteen years I was a great sufferer physically and mentally
Eminent physicians treated me for hereditary consumption torpid liver
and many other diseases I sought relief at famous springs the ozone of
Florida and the pure air of Colorado but in vain My life was one
ceaseless torture

During all this time however I was an earnest seeker after Truth I
examined every religious teaching with a calm and unprejudiced
attention From an orthodox Protestant I became a skeptic and a
follower of Voltaire Tom Paine and Ingersoll yet all the while I
retained faith in a supreme intelligent Being who made all Sick weary
doubting and despairing I accidentally went into a Christian Science
church in New York City on a Wednesday evening not knowing what kind
of a place it was Seeing a large number of people going into the
building I followed supposing that a marriage ceremony had attracted
the crowd Being informed it was their regular Wednesday evening
service I inquired as to the denomination I concluded that it was
another new fad but after investigation I procured a copy of Science
and Health promising I would read it carefully I began reading the
book on Tuesday and finished on Friday of the same week I was still in
the dark I laid the book down involuntarily closed my eyes and
silently prayed to God

I remained in that attitude a few moments when I felt like the mariner
who had been tossed for days upon a boisterous sea the clouds bending
low the billows rolling high all nature wrapped in darkness in his
despair he kneels and commits his soul to God when he suddenly beholds
the North Star breaking through the clouds enabling him to guide his
ship to the shores of safety Many things were made plain to me I saw
that there is one Fatherhood of God and one brotherhood of man that
though once I was blind now I see that there was no more pain nor
aches no fear nor indigestion I slept that night like a babe and
awoke next morning refreshed There are now no traces whatever of my
former complaint and I feel like a new being  L P New York N Y

HEALTH AND PEACE GAINED

About nine years ago I was drawn to Christian Science by a relative
whose many afflictions had given place to health and harmony and whose
loving gratitude was reflected in every word and deed The thought came
to me God indeed healeth all our diseases

My first reading of Science and Health was without understanding I was
full of darkness and gloom and it was laid aside for a time The good
seed had been sown however and erelong the reading was resumed
and with such interest that my afflictions disappeared like mist before
the morning sun Asthma thought to be hereditary neuralgia in an
aggravated form and besides these the tobacco and liquor habit of many
years standing left me Bless the Lord He sent his word and healed
me  for the reading of Science and Health brought to my consciousness
the truth that makes free  S Shellman Ga

CONSUMPTION QUICKLY CURED

I became interested in Christian Science nearly five years ago through
the healing of my wife of what the doctors called consumption in its
last stages I had tried everything that I could get in the way of
materia medica and every doctor would tell me nearly the same story
about the case At last they recommended for her only a higher drier
climate and when she would be at her worst to give her something to
quiet her

I tried different climates but she was no better indeed worse At last
she struggled along until the first of March 1899 She had taken to her
bed again For two days and nights she suffered and I called a
physician He came and diagnosed the case and said that he could do
nothing for her but give her some morphine tablets to make her rest I
gave her two of them according to direction and just before the time to
give her the third she called me to her bedside and said  Dont give
me any more of that stuff for it does me more harm than good so I
turned and placed them in the fire though I did not then know anything
about Christian Science We had heard of it but that was all I gave
her the last tablet at eight oclock that night and about nine oclock
the next day a lady who had been healed in Christian Science visited
her and introduced her to this great truth She accepted it and thought
she would try it The lady loaned her Science and Health She got the
book about ten oclock that day and read it until dinner was called She
ate a hearty dinner the first in about three days and that same
evening she dressed herself walked into the diningroom ate a hearty
supper and enjoyed it She slept well that night She borrowed this
ladys copy of Science and Health two hours each day for eight days and
was healed The first day that she read Science and Health she weighed
about ninetyfive pounds Three months later she weighed one hundred and
thirtyfive pounds  A J D Houston Tex

A PROFITABLE STUDY

It may help others to know that some one was really healed of severe
illness through Christian Science It is over nine years since we first
became interested in the Science and it would be hard to find a
healthier person than I am now I can go all day from morning till
night upheld by the thought that they that wait upon the Lord shall
renew their strength I can truly say that I scarcely know what
physical weariness is any more Before I came into Science the
physicians said that one lung was gone and that the other was affected
with tuberculosis so from their standpoint there was little left for
me to hope for We had tried every remedy that they had suggested I had
gone to the mountains but could not stay there on account of the
altitude and when they did not know what else to do they said we would
better go to England  that the ocean air would be beneficial So we
spent three months in the British Isles and when I came back I seemed
much better but this only lasted a short time In little more than a
month I was worse than ever and my mother was told that I had but a few
weeks or at most months to live

At that time a lady a stranger to us suggested that we try Christian
Science There was no prejudice against it as we did not even know what
it was We knew of no Scientists in the Western town where we were
living and when we were told that we could send to Kansas City for
absent treatment we thought it was absurd We were then told that many
people had been healed through the reading of the Christian Science
textbook Science and Health and to us this seemed a little worse than
the absent treatment but as we had tried everything we had heard of up
to that time my mother sent for the book

It came in the middle of October and we began to read it together It
seemed to me from the first that it was something I had always believed
but did not know how to express  it seemed such a natural thing My
improvement was very gradual but I felt I was recovering After the
Christmas holidays I started in at school and went the whole term
without missing a day  something I had never done before I finished
my school course without missing a day  in fact I have not spent a day
in bed since that time I feel absolutely certain that I have two sound
healthy lungs now The hollows in my chest have filled out and I
breathe perfectly on both sides rarely have a cold to meet and have
not a sign of a cough

People sometimes say Oh well maybe you never had consumption Well
I had all the symptoms and they are every one gone through the reading
of Science and Health  E L B Chicago Ill

HEALED OF INFIDELITY AND MANY PHYSICAL ILLS

I feel compelled to write my testimony and hope that I may be accepted
as one more witness to the Truth as contained in Science and Health with
Key to the Scriptures

In the year 1883 I first heard of Christian Science I was sitting in a
saloon in Leadville Col reading a daily paper of that place My eyes
lighted upon an article which spoke of some peculiar people in Boston
who claimed to have discovered how to heal as Jesus healed I do not
remember much of the article but those words stayed with me

I had drifted out to Colorado from New York City my home where I had
been under the treatment of many leading physicians The last one who
was too honest to take my money knowing that he could not cure me
advised me to keep away from doctors and quit taking medicine as
nothing but death could cure me My trouble was pronounced by some to be
Brights disease by others gravel on the kidneys with very acute
inflammation of the bladder and prostate gland

In the spring of 1888 my wife and myself were spending the evening at
the house of a gentleman whose wife had been healed in the East by
Christian Science The gentleman took a book from its bookcase saying
Here is a work on Christian Science It proved to be Science and
Health I knew as soon as I had read the titlepage that this was the
very book we wanted We immediately sent for the book and when it
arrived we obeyed the angel and feasted on it I was very much
prejudiced against the Bible and my first demonstration over self was
to consent to read the four Gospels My wife bought me a New Testament
and I began to read it What a change came over me All my prejudice was
gone in an instant When I read the Masters words I caught his meaning
and the lesson he tried to convey It was not difficult for me to accept
the whole Bible for I could not help myself I was just captured The
disease with which I had been troubled for years tormented me worse than
ever for about six months as if trying to turn me aside but I lost all
fear of it

I kept up my study of Science and Health and the disease disappeared I
can honestly say that Science and Health was my only healer and it has
been my only teacher  R A C Los Angeles Cal

DISEASED EYES CURED

Christian Science came to me when I was a wreck my body being
completely covered with sores My eyes were very bad so that I sat in a
darkened room for weeks together most of the time in bed under opiates
The home doctor and a specialist said the disease of the eyes could not
be cured though they might help me for a while I had one operation
and the doctor said if I took cold I would become totally blind My
suffering was beyond telling

A clergyman called almost every day and sat by my bed and wept and my
good kind doctor shed tears many times Finally after a year of this
terrible suffering I was sent to Indiana to a sister who had been
healed of lung trouble by Christian Science The first day I was there
she read to me from the Bible and from Science and Health with Key to
the Scriptures by Mrs Eddy and I was healed I knew that God was no
respecter of persons and when I saw what had been done for my sister
who was changed from being a mere frame to a strong robust healthy
rosycheeked woman the cough all gone I said God has as much for me
if I will accept it I was healed instantaneously by Christian Science
and am thankful to God for giving us this understanding through Mrs
Eddy our beloved Leader I am now in perfect health  Mrs F S
Laurel Miss

THE TEXTBOOK HEALED ME

For twelve years previous to the fall of 1897 I had been under the care
of a physician much of the time Different opinions were given by them
as to the nature of the trouble some diagnosing it as an abnormal
growth etc I was healed through reading Science and Health with Key
to the Scriptures by Mrs Eddy It was a clear case of transformation
of the body by the renewal of the mind I am perfectly well at the
present time  J M H Omaha Neb

OBSTINATE STOMACH TROUBLE HEALED

There is no doubt that by far the greater number come to Christian
Science by the way of physical healing but there are those to whom
this does not particularly appeal In the hope
that it may be of benefit to some such and in gratitude for help
received I submit my own experience Three years ago I knew nothing of
Christian Science aside from the knowledge gathered from the daily
papers and current literature When I thought of the subject at all it
was to class Christian Science with various human theories with which I
could not be in sympathy for they seemed to rely upon both good and
evil I had never known of a case of healing had never read the
textbook or heard of the Journal or Sentinel but I would sometimes
see people going into the Christian Science church I was tired of
trying to find anything satisfactory in religious belief for it seemed
as if God either could not or would not bring into harmony the terrible
conditions existing in human society I had quit using any form of
prayer except the Lords Prayer and even then omitted the words lead
us not into temptation How I longed to know just a little of the
why and wherefore of it all

Here is where Christian Science found me I was thrown in contact with a
dear friend of whom I had seen very little for a year or more a
thoroughly educated woman and a thinker She told me she had taken some
treatments in Christian Science for a physical trouble and had become
very much interested in the study of Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures by Mrs Eddy She asked me if I would like to look at the
book and I said I would be glad to do so The first chapter Prayer
appealed to me from the first and when I came to Mrs Eddys spiritual
sense of the Lords Prayer Science and Health p 17 my interest was
fully aroused I knew that in a dim way I was learning what it means to
pray without ceasing Very soon I bought a book of my own and with
the help of our LessonSermons as given in the Quarterly I began in
earnest the study of Science and Health in connection with the Bible

I stood very much in need of physical healing at this time having
suffered for several years from an obstinate form of stomach trouble So
far as I know I gave no thought to the benefits I might derive
physically from the study but I did believe this Science held the truth
of things and I was so absorbed in getting an understanding of the
Principle that I thought very little of myself After about three or
four months study I realized that the stomach trouble was gone and
with it went other physical troubles which have never returned This
healing was brought about by the earnest conscientious seeking for the
truth as contained in the Bible and interpreted by our Leader in our
textbook Science and Health I have since learned more of the Science
of healing and have been able in a small way to help others in need I
have also learned that in living and loving is healing realized and in
reflecting divine Love I have the signs following

When we think of the pure loving unselfish life Mrs Eddy must have
lived in order to become conscious of this truth and give it to us
words are a poor medium through which to express the gratitude which her
followers feel for her It is best expressed by obediently following
her even as she is following Christ  H T Omaha Neb

DYSPEPSIA QUICKLY HEALED

It has occurred to me that I have had ample time to meditate on the many
blessings which I have received through Christian Science as it is now
more than six years since I was entirely healed of dyspepsia as well as
constipation in its worst form by the reading of Science and Health So
aggravated were the conditions that for three years or more I was unable
to drink a glass of cold water Everything that I drank had to be hot and
my only means of relief from the bowel trouble was hot water injections
for a period of more than three years

I can truthfully say that I was permanently and I might say instantly
healed of those two ailments by reading Science and Health as before
stated and in fact I do not think I had read more than thirty pages of
this book when I ignored entirely the most rigid kind of diet I ate and
drank everything I wished without a single harmful effect from that time
to this date and there has not been a drop of medicine in our home for
more than six years in a family of five

I have also seen the power of Truth manifested in our home by having our
youngest child relieved of the most excruciating pain and changed to
his most playful mood immediately upon notifying one of the faithful
practitioners of this city For all this I am endeavoring to be thankful
to God and to our faithful Leader Mrs Eddy whose pure and undefiled
life enabled her to discover this precious truth for the benefit of all
mankind  M C McK Denver Col

AFTER TWENTY YEARS SUFFERING

From early girlhood I was considered an invalid having been injured by
a hard fall while playing The pain was intense for some time and for
several hours I was unable to walk or stand alone Later a growing
weakness of the back accompanied with sharp pains alarmed my parents
who called a physician and he pronounced it spinal trouble Then
followed nearly twenty years of increased suffering at times very
severe As years went by and I became a wife and mother my suffering
increased Everything that medical skill could do was done but finding
no lasting benefit from anything I lost hope of recovery

When Christian Science found me I was under the doctors sentence that
if I lived the week through I would become entirely helpless not able
to move hand or foot My husband was a travelling man and being
urgently called home he met an old friend on the train who asked why we
did not try Christian Science The reply We know nothing of it was
followed by a brief explanation of its healing power and the benefit his
family had received This inspired my husband with new hope and on his
arrival at home he called on a practitioner who recommended our getting
Science and Health which we did but ignorance and the prejudice of old
education produced such fear that I hid the book under the covers of the
bed whenever the children came into the room fearing that it was not of
God and would injure them Gods dear love was however more potent
than these foolish fears and the first day I read from its sacred pages
I was convinced its teachings were the same truths as Jesus Christ had
taught centuries ago When I had read a few pages I reached out and
threw my medicine from the open window at the head of my bed I then
turned back to the book and began reading again when lo the
Christidea dawned upon me and I was healed instantaneously

I first noticed the spot in my back cooling and soon I got out of bed
I continued to read eagerly I felt as if I wanted to devour the healing
truth and drank it in as a thirsty plant does the gentle rain When
dinner was prepared I walked out and ate a hearty meal with the family
to the amazement of all We shall never forget what a joyful meal this
was How we did thank God for Christian Science

As year after year has gone by till twenty years have passed and the
healing has remained perfect I have grown to thank God with deeper
sincerity that one brave woman was found pure enough to bring forth this
Christhealing again to remain forever among men and to save suffering
humanity from all disease and sin  Mrs P L H Fairmont Minn

FROM DESPAIR TO HOPE AND JOY

I have often had a desire to make public what Christian Science has done
for me but I never could tell of all my blessings they are so many
From childhood I was always sick never knew one hour of rest and was
under the doctors care most of the time I was living in the East at
that time and was advised to try change of climate which I did I came
West with my family in the spring of the year but instead of growing
better I grew steadily worse until at last I was obliged to keep my bed
for nearly three years  a great sufferer My ailments were it seemed
all that flesh is heir to and were called incurable by the doctors
viz Brights disease and many others  in the last stages My case
was known among physicians many of whom were prominent specialists as
a most extreme one Many upon looking at me would turn away with a
wise shake of the head and say What keeps her alive My physicians
who were exceedingly kind and did all that lay within their power for
me gave me up and the death sentence was pronounced on me by all who
attended me

It was then I realized that mans extremity is Gods opportunity The
little book was handed me at this hour of great need I read it not
thinking it would heal me but like a drowning man I grasped at it I
read it read it again and soon found myself growing stronger then I
kept on reading and was perfectly healed of all the supposedly incurable
diseases  L B Austin Minn

TRUTH MAKES FREE

As the son of a physician a graduate in pharmacy and an exdruggist I
had a perfect contempt for what I thought Christian Science to be About
six and a half years ago however having exhausted all material means
at my command  materia medica electricity gymnastics cycling and
so on  and being in a hopeless state the study of Christian Science
was taken up I had been a sufferer from catarrh and sore throat for
over thirty years and in the last five were added several others
including dyspepsia and bronchitis and a loss in flesh of sixty
pounds I was completely healed and regained health strength and
flesh through the spiritual understanding of Christian Science the
result of about six weeks study This good and perfect gift came to me
through the careful and prayerful study of Christian Science as
revealed to the world today through Science and Health The promise of
Christ Jesus the truth shall make you free was fulfilled and the
past six years of health and harmony have been spent in striving to
hold fast that which is good

While most grateful for the physical
healing my gratitude for the mental and spiritual regeneration is
beyond expression When I learned that Jesus mission of healing
sickness as well as sin did not end with his short stay upon earth but
is practical in all ages my joy was unbounded Having spent thousands
in the old way it seemed wonderful to be healed at such small cost as
the price of the little book and a few weeks study Every thought of
prejudice immediately vanished before the proofs that Christian Science
is indeed the elucidation and practical application of Jesus teachings
which are demonstrable truth The same yesterday and today and
forever  C N C Memphis Tenn

DEAF EARS UNSTOPPED

As a mother of a family my heart goes out in love and gratitude to that
good woman we are privileged to call our Leader for all she has done
through her book for me and mine

Ten years ago I was healed of hereditary deafness and catarrh of the
head simply through reading the book Science and Health For years
previous I had consulted and taken treatment from some of the best
specialists for the ear and throat both in England and America but
grew worse all the time I was then urged by a lady who had been healed
through Christian Science to buy this book and study it I did so very
reluctantly but had not read fifty pages before I felt I had indeed
found the truth which makes free and can truly say from that time I
have never had a return of the ailment

That for which I am however most grateful is the daily help it is to
me in my household of young children I am sure if mothers only knew
what Christian Science truly means they would give all they possess to
know it We have seen croup measles fever and various other
childrens complaints socalled disappear like dew before the morning
sun through the application of Christian Science  the understanding
of God as everpresent and omnipotent It has been proven to me without
a doubt that God is a very present help in trouble and what a blessed
help this wonderful truth is in the training of our children and how
quickly the child grasps it

Some time ago my little girl then three years old dislocated her
shoulder I was alone in the house at the time The pain was so intense
that she became faint I treated her the best I knew how but kept
holding the thought that just as soon as some one came I would run for
help She seemed to grow worse and cried very much I undressed her and
tried to twist the arm into place but it caused such suffering that I
began to get afraid Then like a flash came the thought What would you
do if you were out of the reach of a practitioner Now is your time to
prove Gods power and presence With these thoughts came such a sense of
calm and trustfulness that I lost all fear I then asked the child if I
should read to her she said Yes mamma read the truthbook I began
reading aloud to her from Science and Health In about half an hour I
noticed she tried to lift the arm but screamed and became very pale I
continued to read aloud and again she made an effort to put some candy
into her mouth This time I noticed with joy that she almost reached her
mouth before she felt the pain I kept reading aloud to her until my
sister and two boys came in when she jumped off her bed so delighted
to see her brothers that she forgot her arm She then began to tell her
aunt that she had broken her arm and mamma treated it with the
truthbook When this happened it was about 1030 A M and by 3 P M
she was playing out doors as though nothing had ever happened  Mrs M

SAVED FROM INSANITY AND SUICIDE

A few years ago while under a sense of darkness and despair caused by
ill health and an unhappy home Science and Health was loaned me with a
request that I should read it

At that time my daughter was given up by materia medica to die of
lingering consumption supposed to have been inherited My own condition
seemed even more alarming as insanity was being manifested and rather
than go to an insane asylum it seemed to me the only thing to do was to
commit suicide Heart trouble kidney complaint and continual headaches
caused from female trouble were some of the many ailments I had to
contend with My doctor tried to persuade me to undergo an operation as
a means of relief but I had submitted to a severe operation ten years
previous and found only additional suffering as a result so I would
not consent

When I began with Science and Health I read the chapter on Prayer
first and at that time did not suppose it possible for me to remember
anything I read but felt a sweet sense of Gods protection and power
and a hope that I should at last find Him to be what I so much needed 
a present help in time of trouble Before that chapter on Prayer was
finished my daughter was downstairs eating three meals a day and daily
growing stronger Before I had finished reading the textbook she was
well but never having heard that the reading of Science and Health
healed any one it was several months before I gave God the glory

One by one my many ailments left me all but the headaches they were
less frequent until at the end of three years the fear of them was
entirely overcome

Neither myself nor my daughter have ever received treatments but the
study of the Bible and Science and Health the Christian Science
textbook by Mrs Eddy has healed us and keeps us well

While Christian Science was very new to me I attended an experience
meeting in First Church of Christ Scientist Chicago A gentleman told
of an unhappy woman who was about to separate from her husband This
gentleman had asked her if she did not love her husband She replied
No when I married him I did but not now He told her God made man in
His image and likeness and that He is perfect He said to her Go home
and see only Gods perfect man you dont need to love a sinful mortal
such as you have been looking upon The lady followed his advice as he
told her there is no separation in divine Mind In a short time peace
and harmony were in her home and both husband and wife became members
of a Christian Science church

This testimony was like a message from heaven to me I had received many
benefits from the study of Science and Health but it had never dawned
upon my darkened consciousness till then how wonderful our God is I
knew what had taken place in that home could take place in my unhappy
home where there was neither rest nor peace

I hopefully took up my cross and step by step my burden grew lighter
as I journeyed along realizing the presence of the Christ Truth that
indeed makes us free Not all at once did any outward change appear but
at the end of three years all was peace all the members of the family
attending church together and realizing that there is but one Mind  E

STOMACH TROUBLE HEALED

I was healed of stomach trouble of many years standing by reading
Science and Health My condition had reached the stage in which I had
periodical attacks that came on with greater frequency I was a
travelling salesman and it was a common occurrence for me to have to
call a physician to my hotel to administer morphine for an acute form of
this disease This became a regular thing at certain places and these
attacks always left me worse than before As a result of the last one I
lost a great deal in weight I had tried many physicians and most of the
usual remedies during these years of suffering without any good result
Finally as a last resort I decided to try Christian Science and I was
healed by reading Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by
Mrs Eddy

My health has been of the best since I was healed now six years ago In
the family we have depended entirely on Christian Science for our
healing and have ever found it efficacious We consider the physical
healing however only incidental to the understanding of God and His
goodness This together with our increased love for the Bible is
proving most valuable to us We are humbly trying to live the lives that
will prove our gratitude to God and to our beloved Leader Mrs Eddy

FREED FROM MANY YEARS OF SUFFERING

In the spring of 1880 I was taken down with a severe attack of stomach
trouble was bedfast for three months and not able to drive out for
nearly six months During this time I had three good doctors treating
me I gained a little in strength but had very little relief from the
stomach trouble I was recommended to try mineral springs and did so
but with the same disappointment I went to a sanitarium but yet the
stomach trouble prevailed I had some friends who recommended patent
medicines but no healing came

I worried along in this way for several years Finally I read medicine
nearly two years with a good doctor friend especially for my own
benefit and during this time I had a severe attack of bladder trouble
and for fifteen years I suffered so severely at times that I thought
life was not really worth living In connection with these
troubles I suffered every winter with rheumatism and the grip I also
had a growth coming on both eyes called cataract which caused my eyes
to be inflamed nearly all the time and this growth had made such
progress that it was causing my vision to be very dim when reading
Corns were not forgotten as I was reminded of them very frequently and
for all these troubles I had tried every remedy I heard of that I was
able to get specialists included without relief

Thanks to a friend who took me in this hopeless discouraged condition
and led me to the light that never knows darkness I got a copy of
Science and Health by Mrs Eddy and was healed in a short time by
reading this work  D W L Anderson Ind

RELIEF FROM INTENSE SUFFERING

I became interested in Christian Science in 1901 For four or five years
I had suffered with severe attacks which nothing but an opiate seemed to
relieve After one which I think was the worst I ever had I consulted
our family physician who diagnosed my case as a dangerous kidney
disease and said that no medicine could help me but that I must undergo
a surgical operation I continued to grow worse and went to see the
physician again and he advised me to consult a doctor who was connected
with the city hospital of Augusta This doctor made an examination and
diagnosed the difficulty as something different but quite as serious
Meanwhile a friend offered me a copy of Science and Health I said I did
not care to read the book but she was so urgent that I finally promised
to do so I received the book on Saturday and on Sunday morning I sat
down to read it When I reached the place where Mrs Eddy says she found
this truth in the Bible I began comparing the two books I read
passages which looked very reasonable to me and said to myself This is
nearer to the truth than anything I have ever seen I continued to read
all day stopping only long enough to eat my dinner As I read on
everything became clearer to me and I felt that I was healed During
the evening a neighbor came in and I said I am healed and that book
has healed me I read on and was certainly healed Eight days after my
healing I did my own washing This occurred in February 1901 About six
weeks after I was called to care for my mother who was under the care
of my former physician I again let him examine my side as he wished to
see if the trouble was still there He said It is certainly gone I
said to him Doctor you told me I would never be a well woman unless I
was operated upon what has healed me He replied God has healed
you  S H L North Pittston Me

GRATEFUL FOR MANY BLESSINGS

It is with sincere gratitude for the many blessings Christian Science
has brought me that I give this testimony I first heard of Christian
Science about fifteen years ago A friend of mine was taking treatment
for physical troubles and was reading the textbook of Christian
Science Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures The title of the
book appealed to me very strongly I said to my friend If that is a
Key to the Scriptures I must have it

I had long been a member of a Bible class in an orthodox Sabbath school
but I never felt satisfied with that which was taught there was
something lacking I did not understand then what it was I purchased a
copy of Science and Health and began to study it I wish I could express
in words what that book brought me It illumined the Bible with a
glorious light and I began to understand some of the Masters sayings
and tried to apply them

I had had a longing to live a better Christian life for many years and
often wondered why I failed so utterly to understand the Bible Now I
knew it was lack of spiritual apprehension

I did not know at first that people were healed of disease and sin by
simply reading Science and Health but found after a while that such was
the case At that time I had many physical troubles and one after
another of these ills simply disappeared and I found that I had no
disease  I was perfectly free The spiritual uplifting was glorious
too and as I go on in the study of this blessed Science I find I am
gaining surely an understanding that helps me to overcome both sin and
disease in myself and in others My faith in good is increased and I
know I am losing my belief in evil as a power equal to good The pathway
is not wearisome because each victory over self gives stronger faith
and a more earnest desire to press on  E J R Toledo Ohio

GRATEFUL FOR MORAL AND SPIRITUAL AWAKENING

About four years ago after I had tried different ways and means to be
relieved from bodily suffering a faithful friend called my attention to
the teaching of Christian Science After some opposition I decided to
investigate it with the thoughtthat if this teaching would be helpful
it was meant for me as well as for others if it did not afford any help I
could put it aside again but that I would find out and be convinced

After I had read Mrs Eddys work Science and Health a few days I
found that my ailments had disappeared and a rest had come to me which
I had never before known I had smoked almost incessantly although I
had often determined to use my will power and never smoke again but had
always failed This desire as well as the desire for drink simply
disappeared and I wish to say here that I received all these benefits
before I had gained much understanding of what I was reading Like a
prisoner who had been in chains for years I was suddenly set free I
did not then know how the chain had been removed but I had to
acknowledge that it came through the reading of this book I then felt
an ardent desire to read more and to know what this power was that had
freed me in a few days of that which I had been trying for years to
shake off and had failed It then became clear to me that this was the
truth which Jesus Christ taught and preached to free humanity almost two
thousand years ago It did not however occur to me to apply it in my
business affairs on the contrary I first thought that if I continued
in my study I would have to retire from business

This did not happen however for I gradually found that the little
understanding of this wonderful teaching which I had acquired became a
great help to me in my business I became more friendly more honest
more loving to my fellowmen and I also acquired better judgment and
was able to do the right thing at the right time As a natural result my
business improved Before I knew anything of Christian Science my
business had often been a burden to me fear and worry deprived me of my
rest How different it is now Through the study of the Bible which now
possesses unmeasurable treasures for me and for our textbook Science
and Health and the other works of our Leader I receive peace and
confidence in God and that insight into character which is necessary for
the correct management of any business  W H H Bloomfield Neb

HEREDITARY DISEASE OF THE LUNGS CURED

For a long time I have been impelled to contribute a testimony of the
healing power of Truth As I read other testimonies and rejoice in them
some one may rejoice in mine I was healed by reading Science and
Health By applying it I found it to be the truth that Jesus taught 
the truth that sets free

From childhood I had never known a well day I was healed of lung
trouble of long standing Consumption was hereditary in our family my
mother and three brothers having passed on with it The law of materia
medica said that in a short time I must follow them I also had severe
stomach trouble of over eight years standing during which time I
always retired without supper as the fear of suffering from my food was
so great that I denied myself food when hungry For over twenty years I
had ovarian trouble which was almost unbearable at times It dated from
the birth of my first child and at one time necessitated an operation
I suffered with about all the ills that flesh is heir to I had trouble
with my eyes from a child wore glasses for fourteen years several
oculists saying I would go blind one declaring I would be blind in less
than a year if I did not submit to an operation which I refused to do

But thanks be to God whose Truth reached me through the study of our
textbook Words fail to express what Christian Science has done for me
in various ways for my children my home my all The physical healing
is but a small part the spiritual unfolding and uplifting is the pearl
of great price the half that has never been told  Mrs J P M

TEXTBOOK APPRECIATED

It has been my privilege to have interviews with representatives of more
than sixty per cent of the nations of this earth under their own vine
and figtree I had never heard a principle understandingly advanced
that would enable mankind to obey the apostolic command prove all
things until Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures was placed
in my hands I believe that the honest study of this book in connection
with the Bible will enable one to prove all things

I make this unqualified statement because of what my eyes have seen and
my ears heard from my fellowmen of unquestioned integrity and the
positive proofs I have gained by the study of these books Many supposed
material laws that had been rooted and grounded in my mentality from
youth have been overcome It required some time for me to wake up to our
Leaders words in Miscellaneous Writings p 206 The advancing stages
of Christian Science are gained through growth not accretion I had
many disappointments and falls before I was willing to do the scientific
work required to prove this statement yet notwithstanding the cost to
ourselves I am convinced that we cannot do much credit to the cause we
profess to love until we place ourselves in a position to prove God as
He really is to us individually and our relation to Him by scientific
work

I wish to express loving gratitude to our Leader for the new edition of
Science and Health In studying this new edition one cannot help seeing
the wisdom love and careful and prayerful thought expressed in the
revision Often the changing of a single word in a sentence makes the
scientific thought not only more lucid to him who is familiar with the
book but also to those just coming into the blessed light All honor to
that Godloving Godfearing woman Mary Baker G Eddy whose only work
is the work of love in the helping of mankind to help themselves who
has placed before her fellowmen understandingly what mans divine
rights are and what God really is  H W B Hartford Conn

RUPTURE AND OTHER SERIOUS ILLS HEALED

When I took up the study of Christian Science nearly three years ago I
was suffering from a very bad rupture of thirtytwo years standing
Sometimes the pain was so severe that it seemed as if I could not endure
it These spells would last four or five hours and while everything was
done for me that could be done no permanent relief came to me until I
commenced reading Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures After I
had once looked into it I wanted to read all the time I was so absorbed
in the study of the little book that I hardly realized when the
healing came but I was healed not only of the rupture but also of
other troubles  inflammatory rheumatism catarrh corns and bunions

I would never part with the book if I could not get another I am
seventyseven years old and am enjoying very good health  Mrs M E
P St Johnsbury Vt

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER HEALED

When Christian Science came to me I had been taking medicine every day
for twenty years on account of constipation I had been treated by
doctors and specialists had taken magnetic treatments and osteopathy
had tried change of climate had an operation in a hospital and when I
came out was worse than before I was so discouraged after I had tried
everything I ever heard of and was no better but rather grew worse
that it seemed as though I must give up trying to get well when a
friend suggested that I try Christian Science I had heard that
Christian Scientists healed by prayer and I thought this must be the
way Jesus had healed I felt that this was all there was left for me to
try I sent for the book Science and Health and commenced to read it
out of curiosity not thinking or knowing that I could be helped by the
reading but thinking I must still take medicine and that I must also
have treatment by a Scientist I however dropped my medicine and read
for three days then a light began to shine in the darkness I was
healed of the trouble and have never had to take medicine since I have
studied Science and Health faithfully ever since and other ailments
have disappeared My little daughter has also been healed and has
learned to use this knowledge in her school work  Mrs O R
Leadville Col

LIVER COMPLAINT HEALED

As my thoughts go back to the time when I believed I had nothing to live
for and when each mornings awaking from sleep brought a sense of
disappointment to find myself still among the living for I had hoped
each night that I closed my eyes in sleep that it would be the last
time my heart overflows with love and gratitude to God for our dear
Leader who discovered this blessed truth and to the dear ones who have
helped me so lovingly and patiently over many rough places

Twelve years ago I consulted a physician because I had noticed some
oddlooking spots on one of my arms He said they were liver spots but
that it was not worth while prescribing for those few that I should
wait until I was covered with them About three months later with the
exception of my face and hands I was covered with them Then I became
alarmed and called on another physician who prescribed for me but be
finally said he could do no more for me Other physicians were consulted
with no better results Six years ago friends advised me to see their
family physician and when I called on him he said he was positive he
could cure me so I asked him to prescribe for me At the end of two
years after prescribing steadily he said I was so full of medicine
that he was afraid to have me take any more and advised a rest After
having paid out a small fortune I was no better and very much
discouraged

Two years ago having failed in business I applied to one of my patrons
for a furnished room where I could meet the few I still had left This
lady who is a Christian Scientist loaned me Science and Health and
because she asked me so often how I was getting on with the book I
began reading it I also attended the Wednesday evening meetings which I
found very interesting After hearing the testimonies at the meetings I
decided to speak to some practitioner about these spots but not until I
had at least a hundred dollars on hand because I thought I would
require that amount for treatments as I had been accustomed to paying
high prices I had not inquired about prices and in fact did not speak
to any one about my intentions because I felt sensitive on this
subject When I had read about half of Science and Health I missed the
spots and upon searching could find no trace of them They had entirely
disappeared without treatment In a few weeks the reading of that book
had accomplished what materia medica had failed to accomplish in ten
years It is impossible to express the feeling of relief and happiness
which came over me then  C K Astoria N Y

A CONVINCING INVESTIGATION

While I have testified to those around me and in many localities of my
healing in Christian Science I feel that it is high time I put the
candle in the candlestick where all who will may see My earliest
recollection was a day of suffering  a physical inheritance from my
mother which gave simple interest for a time until years advanced and
compound interest was added My father was a physician and material
remedies were used for my mother without avail consequently his
confidence in them for me was shaken  in fact he often told me it was
better to suffer without medicine than become a chronic doser without
pain

I began teaching in early life and continued for more than twenty years
and during that time not a day passed without pain or fear of pain and
only for my innate love of life it would have become an intolerable
burden For five years oatmeal was my chief food and I became almost as
attached to it as Kaspar Hauser to his crust I was early taught to have
faith in God and many times was relieved of pain only to have it appear
again in an aggravated form

At last my heart cried out for the living God and the answer came by
one of His messengers who told me of Christian Science I replied that
I believed God could heal but that I had no faith in the healing of
Christian Science but would like to investigate its theology as it
might aid in giving me some clue to the meaning of life For three years
I had searched the works of the most scientific writers to find the
origin of life many times I would think I had traced it to the
beginning but it would elude my grasp every time One day in talking
with my friend she said she would like to loan me the textbook Science
and Health which I very willingly accepted Not long afterward I felt a
severe attack of suffering I opened the book for the first time and
found a paragraph near the middle which attracted my attention I read
the same paragraph over and over for nearly two hours When the tea bell
rang I closed the book and I shall never forget my perception of the new
heaven and the new earth  everything in nature that I could see seemed
to have been washed and made clean The flowers that I have always loved
so much and that from childhood had told me such sweet stories now
spoke to me of the Allinall the hearts of my friends seemed kinder 
I had touched the hem of the garment of healing

I ate my supper that evening forgetful of the preparations I had made
for suffering and when the next day began I was more zealous of good
work than ever before Since closing Science and Health at my first
reading I have never been able to find the paragraph which I had read so
many times over the words seemed to have slipped away from me but my
joy knew no bounds at having found the pearl of great price By the
continued reading of the book I was entirely healed and for fourteen
years I have not seen a day of physical suffering  Miss L M Rome
N Y

DEAFNESS AND DROPSY HEALED

I had been deaf from childhood I suffered intensely after eating and
dropsy was another of my complaints This with consumption caused one
doctor to say  It puzzles me I have never seen such a case before as
yours

I met a friend who had been cured in Christian
Science and she said Try Christian Science I got a copy of Science
and Health and in three weeks I was entirely cured I felt uplifted It
seemed as if Gods arms were around and about me I felt as if heaven
had come down to earth for me After five years of suffering can any one
wonder at my unspeakable gratitude  A B Pittsburg Pa

GRATEFUL FOR MANY BLESSINGS

In 1894 I began the study of Christian Science At that time I was
greatly in need of its healing truth For a number of years previous I
had been a semiinvalid with no hope of ever being well and strong
again Several years before this time I had undergone an operation which
resulted in peritonitis For three years previous to my study of Science
and Health by Mrs Eddy I was scarcely ever free from headache caused
by the weakened and diseased condition of the internal organs At the
time I began the study of Christian Science I was taking five kinds of
medicine

I began to read Science and Health and did not take treatment for I
thought If this is truth I shall be healed if it is not I shall be
able to detect it and will have nothing to do with it I became a
devoted student and gradually my bodily diseases left me  I was free
and since that time nearly ten years ago neither my two children nor
myself have taken any medicine and our understanding of truth has been
able to meet and overcome any suggestion of illness

I was a devoted member of an orthodox church but as I grew older I
began to question my beliefs and to my questions I could find no
satisfactory answer I became dissatisfied and finally ceased attending
church I could not accept the idea of God taught there and at last my
friends looked sadly upon me as an atheist There I stood until I
learned to know God as revealed in Science and Health and then all my
questionings were answered In my girlhood I had always prayed to the
God I held in mind and when the shadows of sickness pain and death
came to my family I prayed as only those can who know that if He helps
not there is none but my prayers were unanswered Then I closed my
Bible saying There is a mistake somewhere perhaps some time I may
know

Only those who know the attitude of mind that I was in can understand
the joy that came to me as I began to learn of God in Christian Science
and of my relation to Him

Many proofs of the healing power of Truth and of His protecting care
throng my thoughts Seven years ago when we were in a far distant
country where Christian Science was then unknown my little daughter
came in one morning from her school saying Mother I have measles
twenty of the girls are sick in bed and I am afraid they will put me
there also Her face hands and chest were covered with a deep red
rash throat sore and eyes inflamed We began immediately to do our
work in Science and at night when I left her at the door of the
college her face was clear her eyes bright and all fear destroyed
That was the end of the disease  F M P Boston Mass

A JOYFUL EXPERIENCE

In love and gratitude to God and to Mrs Eddy the interpreter of
Jesus beautiful teachings I wish to tell of some of the benefits which
I have received from Christian Science It is a little over a year since
Science found me in a deplorable condition physically as well as
mentally I had ailments of many years standing  chronic stomach
trouble severe eye trouble made almost unbearable from the constant
fear of losing any sight a fate which had befallen my mother also a
painful rupture of twentyfive years standing These ailments combined
with unhappy conditions in my home made me very despondent I had
entirely lost my belief in an allmerciful God and I did not know where
to turn for help At that time Christian Science was brought to my
notice and I shall never forget the sublime moment when I perceived
that an allloving Father is always with me Forgotten was all sorrow
and worry and after four weeks reading in Science and Health all my
ailments had disappeared I am today a healthy contented woman

All this has come to pass in one short year and my earnest desire is to
be more and more worthy to be called a child of God This is in loving
gratitude for an understanding of this glorious truth  Mrs R J
Chicago Ill

AN EVERPRESENT HELP

It is a year since I began to read Science and Health and I will now
try to outline what a knowledge of its teachings has done for me

My condition was then very trying my eyes which had caused me much
trouble since childhood were very painful For these I had been treated
by some of the best specialists in my native land and after coming to
the United States I had been doctored much and had worn glasses for four
years I also had catarrh for which I had taken much medicine without
being relieved In addition to this I was an excessive smoker using
tobacco in some form almost constantly I had contracted a smokers
heart and used liquors freely

The one who brought to me that which I now prize so highly was a book
agent I told him that I should be forced to leave my trade on account
of my eyes He then told me of having been healed of a cancer through
Christian Science treatment He showed me a copy of Science and Health
which had the signs of much use and after being assured that if I did
my part I would be healed of all my diseases I sent for a copy of the
book

My recovery was very rapid for after reading the book only three weeks
I was completely healed of the tobacco habit I will say in regard to
this healing that it did not require even as much as a resolution on my
part I was smoking a cigar while reading Science and Health when all
the desire to continue smoking left me and I have never had a desire to
use tobacco in any form since then My eyes were the next to manifest
the influence of the new knowledge gained and had soon so far recovered
that I could go about my work with ease and I have had no more use for
glasses Today my heart is normal the catarrh has totally disappeared
and I am not addicted to the use of liquor

Christian Science has proved to be an everpresent help not only in
overcoming physical ailments but in business and daily life It has
also overcome a great sense of fear The Bible which I regarded with
suspicion has become my guide and Christianity has become a sweet
reality because the Christian Science textbook has indeed been a Key
to the Scriptures and has breathed through the Gospel pages a sweet
sense of harmony  A F Sioux City Iowa

SEVERE EYE TROUBLE OVERCOME

After hearing Christian Science lightly spoken of from a Christian
pulpit I decided to go to one of the services and hear for myself From
infancy I had been devoted to my church and as soon as I was old enough
I was ever active in the work Feeling it to be my duty to attend every
service held in my own church I took advantage of the Wednesday evening
meetings My first visit was not my last I am thankful to say for I
saw immediately that these people not only preached Christianity but
practised and lived it At that time I was wearing glasses and had worn
them for sixteen years At times I suffered the most intense pain and
for this phase of the trouble one specialist after another had been
consulted All gave me very much the same advice each one urged extreme
carefulness and gave me glasses that seemed to relieve for a time None
of them held out any hope that my sight would ever be restored saying
that the defect had existed since infancy and that in time I should be
blind

The thought of blindness was very distressing to me but I tried to bear
it with Christian resignation since I thought that God had seen fit to
afflict me but since I have learned that He is a loving Father who
gives only good I regret that I ever charged Him with my affliction I
had no treatment but I read Science and Health and my eyes were healed
and glasses laid aside I can never find words to express my thanks to
our dear Leader through whose teachings my sight has been regained I
can truthfully say that whereas I was blind now I see  through an
understanding of Truth I have found my sight perfect as God gave it

A TESTIMONY FROM IRELAND

It is with a heart full of love and gratitude to God and to our dear
Leader that I send this testimony to the Field I had never been a
strong girl had always been subject to colds and chills and suffered
all my life from a delicate throat Seven years ago I had a very severe
attack of rheumatic fever and subsequently two less severe ones These
left all sorts of evils behind them  debility chronic constipation
and several others so that with these ills my life was often a burden
to me and I used to think I never should receive relief or health I had
also lost all love for God and faith in Him I could not accept a God
who as I then believed visited sickness and sorrow upon His children
as a means for drawing them to Him

I was in this state of mind and body when Christian Science found me A
dear friend seeing my suffering presented the truth to me and though
at first I did not believe that there could be healing for me the
Christian Scientists God seemed to be the one I had been looking for
all my life I began to read Science and Health and shall never forget
my joy at finding that I could love and trust God I took to studying
the Bible and read nothing but Science and Health and other Christian
Science literature for a year After studying the little book for
about six weeks I one day realized that I was a well woman that I had
taken no medicine for three weeks and that my body was perfectly
harmonious The reading of Science and Health had healed me The
wonderful joy and spiritual uplifting which came to me then no words of
mine can describe I had also suffered from astigmatism and had for
several years been obliged to use special glasses when reading or
working and could never use my eyes for more than half an hour but
from the first reading of Science and Health I found that I could read
in any light and for any length of time without the slightest
discomfort I am not only grateful for the physical healing but for the
mental regeneration I rejoice that I am now able to help others who are
sick and sorrowing  E E L Curragh Camp County Kildare Ireland

THE TEXTBOOK MAKES OPERATION UNNECESSARY

In the early part of the year 1895 my physician said I must undergo a
surgical operation in order ever to be well

While in great fear and dreading the operation a kind neighbor called
and after telling me of Christian Science gave me a copy of Science and
Health She said I must put aside all medicine and by reading
faithfully she knew I could be healed The book became my constant
companion and in a short time I was healed Besides the relief from an
operation I was completely healed of severe headaches and stomach
trouble Physicians could give me no help for either of these ailments
For ten years I have not used medicine of any kind and have not missed
a Christian Science service on account of sickness during this period I
am perfectly well To say that I am grateful to God for all this does
not express my feelings The physical healing was wonderful but the
understanding given me of God and the ability to help others outweigh
all else I also love our dear Leader  Mrs V I B Concord N H

KIDNEY DISEASE AND EYE TROUBLE HEALED

Early in 1904 I was teaching in a private boardingschool I was a very
unhappy discontented woman I had kidney disease besides sore eyes
and my general health was very bad The doctor said that the climate did
not suit me and that I certainly should have a change The best thing
he said was to go back to France my own country but I did not like
to leave the school so I struggled on until July when we went
travelling for a month but I came home worse than ever I had a lot of
worry one disappointment after another and I often thought that life
was not worth living In September 1904 we heard for the first time of
Christian Science through a girl who was attending our boardingschool
and who was healed through Christian Science treatment We bought the
textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mrs Eddy
and what a revelation it was and is to us it is indeed the fountain of
Truth I had read Science and Health but a very short time when I took
off my glasses began to sleep well and soon found myself well in mind
and body Besides this it has brought harmony into our school where
there had been discord and everything is changed for the better I
cannot describe the happiness that has come to me through Christian
Science I can only exclaim with the psalmist Bless the Lord O my
soul and may God bless Mrs Eddy

My one aim now is to live Christian Science not in words only but in
deeds loving God more and my neighbor as myself and following meekly
and obediently all our Leaders teachings Words cannot express my
gratitude to Mrs Eddy for Christian Science  S A K Vancouver B

DISEASE OF BOWELS HEALED

When I first heard of Christian Science I had been afflicted for nine
years with a very painful disease of the bowels which four physicians
failed even to diagnose all giving different causes for the dreadful
sufferings I endured The last physician advised me to take no more
medicine for these attacks as drugs would not reach the cause or do
any good About this time I heard of Christian Science and had the
opportunity of reading Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures
by Mrs Eddy a few minutes every day for about a week and I
was thereby healed In looking back I found I had not suffered in the
least from the time I began reading this book It has been nearly
seventeen years since this wonderful healing and I have had no return
of the disease My gratitude is endless and can be best expressed by
striving mightily to walk in the path our Leader has so lovingly shown
us in Science and Health  Mrs J W C Scranton Pa

HEALED BY READING THE TEXTBOOK

After doctoring about a year I was obliged to give up school and was
under medical care for two years but grew worse instead of better I
was then taken to specialists who pronounced my case incurable saying
I was in the last stages of kidney disease and could live only a short
time Shortly afterward my uncle gave me a copy of Science and Health
with Key to the Scriptures and asked me to study it After studying a
short time I was able to walk a distance of several miles which I had
not been able to do for three years I also laid aside glasses which I
had worn seven years having been told I would become blind if my eyes
did not receive proper care It is over a year since I received Gods
blessing and I am now enjoying perfect health and happiness I have
never had my glasses on since I first began reading Science and Health
and I have not used any medicine  L R Spring Valley Minn

A TESTIMONY FROM SCOTLAND

I came to Christian Science purely for physical healing I was very ill
and unhappy very cynical and disbelieving in regard to what I heard of
God and religion

I tried to live my life in my own way and put religion aside I was a
great believer in fate and in willpower and thought to put them in the
place of God with the consequence that I was led to do many rash and
foolish things I am now thankful to say that my outlook on life is
entirely changed I have proved Gods wisdom and goodness so often that
I am willing and thankful to know my future is in His hands and that all
things must work out for the best I have found a God whom I can love
and worship with my whole heart and I now read my Bible with interest
and understanding

I was healed of very bad rheumatism simply by reading Science and
Health I had tried many medicines also massage with no result and
the doctors told me that I would always suffer from this disease as it
was inherited and also because I had rheumatic fever when a child I
suffered day and night and nothing relieved me until Science proved to
me the falseness of this belief by removing it I gave up all the
medicines I was taking and have never touched any since and that is
more than two years ago Before this I had often tried to do without a
medicine that I had taken every day for ten years but was always ill
and had to return to it until I found out that one Mind is the only
medicine and then I was freed from the suffering

I had also suffered constantly from bilious attacks colds and a weak
chest and had been warned not to be out in wet weather etc but now
I am glad to say I am quite free from all those material laws and go
out in all sorts of weather  R D F Edinburgh Scotland

CURING BETTER THAN ENDURING

For eight years I was a great sufferer from weak lungs and after being
treated by ten different physicians in the States of Illinois
Missouri and Colorado I was told there was no hope of my recovery from
what they pronounced tuberculosis which was hereditary my father
having been afflicted with it I was greatly emaciated and hardly able
to be about My general condition was aggravated by what the doctors
said was paralysis of the bowels Three physicians so diagnosed it at
different times and assured my husband that I could never get more than
temporary relief This indeed I found difficult to obtain in spite of
my almost frantic efforts At times I was nearly insane from suffering
and after eight years of doctoring I found myself steadily growing
worse For four years I did not have a normal action of the bowels and
it was only by extreme effort and by resort to powerful drugs or
mechanical means with resultant suffering that any action whatever
could be brought about

I had heard nothing of the curative power of Christian Science and only
to oblige a friend I went one night about three years ago to one of
their midweek testimonial meetings in Boulder Colorado I was much
impressed by what I heard there and determined at once to investigate
this strange religion in the hope that it might have something good for
me I bought the textbook Science and Health and from the first I
found myself growing stronger and better both physically and mentally
as I acquired a better understanding and endeavored to put into practice
what I learned In one week I was able to get along better without drugs
than I had for years with them and before three months had passed I was
better than I had been any time in my life for I had always suffered
more or less from bowel trouble Since that time I have taken no
medicine whatever and rely wholly upon Christian Science My lungs are
now sound my bowels normally active my general health excellent and I
am able to endure without fatigue tasks that before would have
prostrated me The study of our textbook was the sole means of my
healing  L M St C Matachin Canal Zone Panama

SEVERE ECZEMA DESTROYED

It is only two years since I came from darkness into the light of
Christian Science and to me the spiritual uplifting has been wonderful
to say nothing of the physical healing Words cannot express my
gratitude for benefits I have received in that time For five years I
suffered with that dreaded disease eczema all over my body Five
doctors said there was no help for me The suffering seemed as terrible
as the hell fire that I had been taught to believe in When Christian
Science came to me two years ago through a dear friend she gave me a
copy of Science and Health and asked me to read it I told her that I
would for I was like a drowning man grasping at a straw I had been a
Bible student for twentyeight years but when I commenced reading
Science and Health with the Bible I was healed in less than a week I
never had a treatment A case of measles was also destroyed in
twentyfour hours after it appeared  Mrs M B G Vermilion Ohio

SCIENCE AND HEALTH A PRICELESS BOON

I am a willing witness to the healing power of Christian Science having
had a lifetimes battle with disease and medical experiments Various
doctors finally admitted that they had exhausted their resources and
could only offer me palliatives saying that a cure was impossible I
had paralysis of the bowels frequent sick headaches with unutterable
agony and my mortal career was nearly brought to an end by a malignant
type of yellow fever Many were the attending evils of this physical
inharmony but God confounds the wisdom of men for while studying
Science and Health two years ago the veil of ignorance was lifted and
perfect health was shown to me to be my real condition and to such
there is no relapse The constant use of glasses which were apparently
a necessity to me for years was proven needless and they were laid
aside Mrs Eddy has made Scripture reading a neverfailing well of
comfort to me By her interpretation the way of the Lord is made
straight to me and mine It aids us in our daily overcoming of the
tyranny of the flesh and its rebellion against the blessed leading of
Christ Truth The daily study of the Bible and our textbook is bringing
more and more into our consciousness the power of God unto salvation

A CRITIC CONVINCED

With gratitude to God I acknowledge my lifelong debt to Christian
Science In 1895 I attended my first Christian Science meeting and was
deeply impressed with the earnestness of the people and the love
reflected but as for the spiritual healing of the physical body I did
not believe such a thing to be possible I bought Science and Health and
studied it to be able to dispute intelligently with the supposedly
deluded followers of Christian Science I pursued the study carefully
and thoroughly and I have had abundant reason since to be glad that I
did for through this study and the resultant understanding of my
relation to God I was healed of a disease with which I had been
afflicted since childhood and for which there was no known remedy
Surely my experience has been the fulfilling in part of the Scripture
He sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from their
destructions I believe that Science and Health reveals the Word
referred to by David  C A B B Kansas City Mo

BORN AGAIN

It was in April 1904 that I first heard the still small voice of
the Christ and received healing through Christian Science and the
blessings have been so many since that it would take too much space to
name them Reared from childhood in an intellectual atmosphere my
paternal grandfather having been an orthodox minister of the old school
for forty years and my father a deep student ever seeking for the
truth of all things I began early to ponder and to study into the
meaning of life and came to the conclusion before I was twenty that
though God probably existed in some remote place still it was
impossible to connect Him with my present living My highest creed
therefore became Do right because it is right and not for fear of
being punished Then began the suffering Sorrow after sorrow followed
each other in rapid succession for ten long years there was no rest
the road was indeed long and hard and had no turning until finally the
one thing that had stood by me all through the trials namely my
health gave way and with that went my last hope But the last hour of
the night had come the dawn of day was at hand a dear friend left
Science and Health upon my piano one day saying that I would gain much
good by reading it

Glad to get away from my own poor thoughts I opened the little book
and began to read I had read only a short time when such a wonderful
transformation took place I was renewed born again Mere words cannot
tell the story of the mighty uplifting that carried me to the very
gates of heaven When I began to read the book life was a burden but
before I had finished reading it the first time I was doing all my
housework and doing it easily and since that glorious day I have been a
well woman My health is splendid and I am striving to let my light so
shine that others may be led to the truth There have been some mighty
struggles with error and I have learned that we cannot reach heaven
with one long stride or easily drift inside the gate but that the
asking and the seeking and the knocking must be earnest and
persistent

For a long time I was always looking back to see if
the error had gone until one day when I realized that to catch a
glimpse of what spiritual sense means I must put corporeal sense behind
me I then set to work in earnest to find the true way I opened Science
and Health and these words were before me If God were understood
instead of being merely believed this understanding would establish
health p 203 I saw that I must get the right understanding of God
I closed the book and with head bowed in prayer I waited with longing
intensity for some answer How long I waited I do not know but
suddenly like a wonderful burst of sunlight after a storm came clearly
this thought Be still and know that I am God I held my breath 
deep into my hungering thought sank the infinite meaning of that I
All selfconceit egotism selfishness everything that constitutes the
mortal I sank abashed out of sight I trod as it were on holy
ground Words are inadequate to convey the fullness of that spiritual
uplifting but others who have had similar experiences will understand

From that hour I have had an intelligent consciousness of the
everpresence of an infinite God who is only good  C B G Hudson
Mass

A RESTLESS SENSE OF EXISTENCE DESTROYED

Through reading Science and Health and the illumination which followed
I was healed of ulceration of the stomach and kindred troubles a
restless sense of existence agnosticism etc The torture I endured
with the stomach trouble I will not attempt to describe The attending
physician declared that I could live but a short time and I felt there
would be a limit to my endurance of the torture but the disease was
dissipated into nothingness through Christian Science which brought me
peace

Like many others I had been seemingly lost in the sea of error without
a compass yet earnestly and honestly seeking a haven I had
investigated all kinds of religions and philosophies that came under my
notice with the exception of Christian Science which was not then
deemed worthy of inquiry and yet it held the very truth I was searching
for  the light which shineth in the darkness and the darkness
comprehended it not Three years of stubborn resistance to Truth with
increasing suffering followed  then the light came and with it a new
experience Now after nine years of Christian Science experience under
severe tests it can be truthfully said that it has not failed me in any
hour of need  J F J Cincinnati Ohio

MORALLY AND PHYSICALLY HEALED

I did not accept Christian Science on account of any healing of my own
but after seeing my mother who was fast drifting toward helplessness
with rheumatism restored to perfect health with only a few treatments
in Christian Science I thought surely this must be the truth as Jesus
taught and practised it and if so it was what I had been longing for

This was about ten years ago and was the first I had ever heard of
Christian Science We soon got a copy of Science and Health and I began
in the right way to see if Christian Science were the truth I had no
thought of studying it for bodily healing in fact I did not think I
needed it for that but my soul cried out for something I had not yet
found This book was indeed a key to the Scriptures

It was not long after I began reading before I discovered that my eyes
were good and strong I could read as much as I wished and at any time
which was something I could not do before as my eyes had always been
weak The doctors said they never would be very strong and that if I
did not wear glasses I might lose my sight altogether I never gave up
to wearing glasses and now thanks to Christian Science I do not need
them my work for the past two years as a railway mail clerk being a
good test At the same time my eyes were healed I also noticed that I
was entirely healed of another ailment which had been with me all my
life and which was believed to be inherited Since that time my growth
has seemed to me slow yet when I look back and view myself as I was
before Christian Science found me and compare it with my life as it now
is I can only close my eyes to the picture and rejoice that I have been
born again and that I have daily been putting off the old man with
his deeds and putting on the new man

Some of the many things that have been overcome through the study of
Science and Health and through realizing and practising the truth it
teaches are profanity the use of tobacco a very quick temper which
made both myself and those around me at times very miserable and such
thoughts as malice revenge etc  O L R Fort Worth Tex

HEALTH AND UNDERSTANDING GAINED

Most of my boyhood days were spent in the hands of physicians From
birth I was considered a very weakly child but my mother was brave and
being much devoted to me did everything within her knowledge and power
for my comfort Sickness and medicine were continually before me and by
the time I reached my teens I thought I knew a material remedy for every
ill I continued in my delusion because I was never told the real cause
of my trouble Besides being under a leading specialist for two years I
was also an outdoor patient at a noted hospital but I was not healed
It is wonderful how the little ones are cared for in the face of all
these seeming difficulties I always used the prayers that I had been
taught and as I grew older I began to ask for wisdom Little by little
I gained a desire for freedom and my prayers finally led me to the
truth The first week that I heard of Christian Science I visited the
home of dear Christian Science friends and was at once refreshed by
their purity of thought and example I bought a copy of Science and
Health and after studying it a little while with the Bible I saw that
if the Bible was true Science and Health must also be true I began to
demonstrate over my physical and mental condition and as soon as the
fear and pain began to leave me I felt encouraged to go on I was
healed and stopped complaining I kept on studying our textbook and
when I got an understanding in a small degree of the Science of Mind my
first thought was to help others I was guided where I could pro
gress in Science and was no longer carried about with every wind of
doctrine but held to Principle as closely as possible From the time
the healing came into my consciousness the desire for material remedies
left me because Christian Science at once pointed out the way to get at
the cause of discord and disease All that I had to give up were the
false beliefs of mortal mind Christian Science then taught me to love
the church and to appreciate what it had already done for mankind I
often thought of the old adage Charity begins at home and after
three years preparation I felt able to take Christian Science to my
home where it found in due time ready acceptance and willing
disciples This gave me even greater joy than my own healing The more
good I saw accomplished the more love I had for the truth Christian
Science changed my course from the first and gave me a nobler aim and
purpose in life I was not so easily influenced by other peoples
shortcomings when I learned that evil has neither personality nor
place I was not so ready to take offence when I found out the way to
work unselfishly for the upbuilding of the Cause  A E J Toledo
Ohio

AN EVERPRESENT HELP FOUND

On the 23rd of March 1900 I received from one of my daughters a copy
of Science and Health on my seventyfirst birthday Although a constant
reader of all kinds of papers and books I had never heard anything of
Christian Science except a short notice that spring in a San Francisco
newspaper from an orthodox clergyman referring to the Christian
Science people in not very complimentary style

In Mrs Eddys book I came across a great deal of thought that was not
readily understood at the first reading but by continued and careful
study and a good deal of help from my knowledge of chemistry and
natural philosophy I soon shook off the belief of sensation in matter
 the socalled elementary substance One afternoon I put the belt on my
circular saw to cut blocks of firewood and also to split a small stick
of frame timber In doing this the stick closed and pinched the saw I
picked up a small wooden wedge and tried to drive it into the saw kerf
but a bit of ice let the stick on to the back of the saw and instantly
it flew with heavy force into my face and bouncing off my left cheek
fell about twenty feet off on the snow The blood spattered on the snow
next the saw table and on feeling with my hand there were two wounds
one on the lock of the jaw and another forward as big as a dollar on
the cheek bone Now I thought to myself there is a case of surgery
for you and without further ceremony I began to treat the case to the
best of my knowledge with the result that the bleeding stopped almost
instantly and so did a thumping pain which had commenced I paid no
more attention to the matter but finished my work and then went to
supper When I washed my face I felt a big lump on the jawbone where
the block of wood struck but after my usual reading I went to bed and
slept all night until near daylight when a pain on the right side awoke
me On feeling with my hand there was another big lump on the right
side but I treated it and went to sleep again I never lost an hour
from the hurt although I found out that my jaw was broken There is no
scar only a little red spot on the cheek and the lumps on the bone
have long since disappeared

In summing up the benefits I have received from the reading of Science
and Health I can but refer to a condition of sickness dating back to
the war 1862 when chronic and malignant diarrhea came near making an
end of my material existence My hearing also was seriously impaired
from the effect of cannon firing at Shiloh but it has come back to me
and where I formerly dared not eat an orange or grapes I can now eat
anything without being hurt My peace of mind is giving me a rest which
I never experienced before during my life and I have ceased to look
away off for the divine presence that was always near though I did not
know it  L B Baldy N M

MANY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL TROUBLES OVERCOME

Less than a year ago when nothing but trouble seemed to encompass me I
was led to Christian Science My mothers copy of Science and Health was
always lying on the table but I scarcely ever read it One day
however the mental conflict was so great I commenced reading in the
hope of obtaining peace Every day since then my companions have been
the Bible and Science and Health At that time I had a very serious
eruption on my face which had been there two years We had consulted
several physicians and used every remedy suggested to eradicate it but
they proved useless I had given up all hopes of its ever being healed
as the physician we last consulted pronounced it tuberculosis of the
skin and incurable A few weeks after I commenced reading I was amazed
to see it almost healed over and today my cheek is perfectly smooth
while the scar is disappearing

In April my baby was born with only the practitioner and a woman friend
present I suffered little pain and the third day I went downstairs I
am able to nurse him  a privilege of which I was deprived with my
first child He is a picture of health having never been sick a day
since he was born  K E W L Mt Dora Fla

A NEW LIFE GAINED

Leaving home when a young man I carried with me a protection against
the temptation of a great city  a mothers prayers and a small Bible
For a time I read the Bible and prayed but without understanding This
did not suffice and evil seemed to gain the victory I soon omitted to
read my Bible forgot to go to God in prayer for guidance and help and
looked to the world for that which it never has and never can give 
health peace and joy

Thus years later when Christian Science came into my home it found me
prayerless churchless godless a home discordant and with no thought
or knowledge of spiritual things Up to this time my wife had for years
been seeking health through the physicians but without success and as
a last resort had been sent to Christian Science The help received was
so wonderful that I commenced the study of Science and Health The first
effect which I realized from the reading of our textbook was a great
love for the Bible and a desire to read it something which I had not
done for years I went in silent prayer to God that I might see the
light and truth which would enable me to become a better man Ye must
be born again Thus again and as a child was I taught to pray the
effectual fervent prayer which availeth much In a few weeks study
of Science and Health together with the Bible and without other help I
was healed of a desire for liquor of years standing and of the use of
tobacco Ten years have passed and these appetites have never returned
I have never used either liquor or tobacco in any form from that time to
the present Surely this Scripture is fulfilled in our home Old things
are passed away behold all things are become new How can we estimate
the value of a book the study of which brings such transformation and
regeneration Only as we endeavor to live and strive to practise what
it teaches can we begin to pay our debt to God and to her whom He has
sent to make plain to human understanding the life and teaching of
Christ Jesus  W H P Boston Mass

A VOICE FROM ENGLAND

For a number of years I was a weary woman not ill enough in health to
be called an invalid but suffering more than could be told with fatigue
and weakness Feeling that this was Gods will I did not ask to be
healed although I was constantly doctoring I suffered with dyspepsia
congestion of the liver and many other things including weak eyesight
With all the medicine and with different changes for rest I never
regained health and thought I never should so I prayed for grace to
bear my cross patiently for others sake One day while lying on my
couch exhausted which had become a frequent experience the words came
to me Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
I rose knelt down and said O God make me well I was telling a friend
this and she kindly gave me a Sentinel Imagine my joy when I saw the
testimonies of healing I believed them remembering our Lords words
Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed I obtained
a copy of Science and Health and before a week had passed I realized
that if God was my all I needed no glasses My eyes were healed in a few
days and since then I have never thought of glasses I was also cured
of dyspepsia and nothing that I have eaten has hurt me since then The
belief in health laws was next destroyed by knowing that our heavenly
Father did not make them and from this has come the beautiful
experience of the overcoming of fatigue

For this alone I can never be thankful enough True indeed are the
words They shall run and not be weary This was more than a year
ago and I can say that not once have I felt inclined to lie on the
couch nor have I had a headache although I am doing more work than
ever before Fear has also been overcome in many ways  A L
Chelmsford England

DEPRAVED APPETITES OVERCOME

When Christian Science first came to me or rather when I first came to
Christian Science I did not have a very bad opinion of myself I
thought I was a pretty good fellow I had no religious views I seemed
to be getting along as well as if not better than some who
professed Christianity So I drifted along until I was led to
investigate Christian Science

As I progressed in the understanding as gained from the study of both
Science and Health and the Bible and commenced to know myself I found
that a great change had been wrought in me For fifteen years I had used
tobacco both chewing and smoking for ten years I had been a victim of
the drink habit sometimes to excess I was also addicted to profanity
Christian Science removed these appetites A stomach trouble and other
lesser ills such as headache a bad temper an inordinate love of
money etc disappeared under the same benign influence Those things
that seemed to be pleasure do not give me pleasure now They were not
real pleasure I have lost nothing I have sacrificed nothing but I
have gained everything and not yet the whole for I can see plenty yet
to be done

The condition of mind before investigating and after is as different as
black and white As Mrs Eddy says Not matter but Mind satisfieth 
G B P Henry S D

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH HEALED

I should like to express my gratitude for the many benefits I have
received through Christian Science and to mention the great joy brought
to me in the thought that man is not the helpless victim of sin
disease and death Through its teachings I have been able to overcome
many errors

When Christian Science found me one year ago last April in Chicago I
was suffering from catarrh of the stomach which had been very
persistent and I had been a slave to the cigarette habit for eighteen
years Pain and weakness had robbed me of all that one holds dear The
first symptoms of the disease appeared about five years ago in the form
of severe cramps of the stomach which finally developed into other
symptoms of that painful disease I doctored continually my diet daily
becoming more rigid until three slices of toast became my daily
allowance of food

In this condition I left the East for my home in Chicago hoping that a
change of climate might benefit me After spending six weeks there and
finding no relief I concluded to return East The Sunday morning before
leaving I picked up a Sunday paper and glancing through the religious
items my eyes fell on the notices of Christian Science church services
Curiosity led me to a service and I shall never forget that morning or
the surprise and joy it gave me to find that beautiful church and to
know that so great a number actually believed that God does heal the
sick today This brought a first ray of hope The evening service found
me there again Among the notices read was that of a reading room
giving the location and time of opening Monday morning found me there
promptly and the first book I picked up was Science and Health which
opened a new world to me

I had dieted so long and suffered so much that I had a morbid fear of
food When I had reached and read of neither food nor the stomach
without the consent of mortal mind can make one suffer Science and
Health p 221 I left the reading room for something to eat I found a
bakery near by and bought a bag of cakes which I ate and shortly after
I had a hearty dinner without the least complaint from my stomach

From that time until now I have eaten anything that I wished and the
craving for cigarettes which I had for many years has entirely
vanished The understanding of Truth which entirely relieved the
diseased stomach healed also the morbid appetite for smoking After
coming back East I bought a copy of Science and Health which I have
read daily and find it a continual help in all the affairs of life

In my home and at work I find this Science a comfort and source of
strength I have had many difficulties in the way but it has helped me
out of them all  W E B New Britain Conn

SPINAL DISEASE HEALED

When I first heard of Christian Science seven years ago I supposed
that it was some old fad under a new name In the little Texas town
where we then lived there were two or three Christian Scientists who met
at the home of one of their number to read the LessonSermon Meeting
one of them one day I asked if unbelievers could come to their
meetings She said that they could if they wanted to I went expecting
them to do something that I could laugh at when telling my friends about
it How surprised I was to find out that they didnt do anything but
read the Bible and another book which they called Science and Health I
still thought it all foolishness but resolved to go to their meetings
until I found out all they believed I continued to go until I began to
understand a little of what they knew not what they believed and
instead of spending my time telling others what a silly thing Christian
Science is I am now trying to find words to tell what a great and
wonderful thing it is I have been healed of socalled incurable spinal
disease of ten years standing by studying the Bible and Science and
Health Science and Health has been my only teacher and I wish to send
my thanks to our dear Leader

There are no other Scientists near where we now live but I have the
Quarterly and study the lessons by myself I have five small children
and Christian Science is invaluable to me in controlling them and in
overcoming their common ills They often help themselves and each other
to destroy their little hurts and fears  Mrs M H Oleta Okla

MANY TROUBLES OVERCOME

In the second chapter of First Peter ninth verse I read that ye
should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness
into his marvellous light The periodicals so wisely established by our
Leader give us one means of showing forth the praises of Truth

From the darkness of physical pain and weariness into the light of
wholeness and joyousness in work and living  from the darkness of a
clouded sight into the light of clearer vision  from the darkness of
doubt and discord into the marvellous light of the reality of good 
this is what a reading of the Christian Science textbook has done for
me

At the time the book was lent to me I was teach
ing in the public schools of Chicago and absences from my work on
account of illness were of frequent occurrence For five weeks I had
been under the care of a specialist for an organic trouble and he said
I would have to come as many more months before a cure could be
effected At this time Science and Health was brought to my notice I
never thought of such a thing as being healed by the reading of the
book but my thought was so changed that I was healed not only of the
organic trouble but of blurred eyesight fatigue and a train of other
discordant manifestations I did not go back to the physician until four
months later to pay my bill which by the way was more than five times
the price of the Science and Health I had purchased From the time I
read the book I taught steadily without losing time from my work I was
helped too with my work in many other ways

Through reading the textbook I learned that God has given us strength to
do all we have to do and that it is the things we do not have to do
the envying strife emulating vainglorying and so on that leave in
their wake fatigue and discord

Gratitude to our beloved Leader Mrs Eddy and to her faithful
students with whom I afterwards became associated can be expressed
only by daily efforts to put into practice what has been taught  T H

PREJUDICE OVERCOME

I became interested in Christian Science somewhat over three years ago
when in much need of help I had never been strong and as I grew older
I grew weaker and at last became so ill that life was a burden to me
Science and Health by Mrs Eddy was sent to me in answer to prayer as
I thought I was a little afraid of all these new fads as I thought
them but I had not read far before I felt that I had found the truth
which makes us free I was healed of stomach trouble inward weakness
and bilious attacks

One physician said I might have to undergo an operation before I could
get well but thanks to this Truth I have found that the only
operation needed was the regeneration of this socalled human mind by
learning to know God In many cases I have been able to help myself and
others

Words cannot express my thanks to Mrs Eddy and to all who are bringing
these great truths to the help of the whole world  E E M

A CONVINCING TESTIMONY

I became interested in Christian Science some five years ago the
practical nature of its statements appealing to me and I must say at
the outset that with my little experience I have found it all and more
than I ever dreamt of realizing on this plane of existence I am
satisfied that I have found Truth God is indeed to me an everpresent
help

My little girl some ten months old was afflicted with constipation It
was so severe I dreaded to go out anywhere with her as I knew not when
she would be taken with a convulsion I had tried all the usual remedies
in such cases but it seemed to grow more obstinate There was a
Christian Scientist living in the same house with us a Scientist who
let her light shine and while she said little I felt the reflection of
Love I had no knowledge of the teachings of Christian Science save
that God was the physician at all times In my own way I believed He was
allpowerful and I said to my husband one day I am through with
medicine for baby I am just going to leave her in Gods care and see
what He will do I have done all I can I did as I said laid my burden
at Gods feet and did not pick it up again In two days the child was
perfectly natural and has since been free from the trouble She is now
six years of age Some months later a second test came She woke up at
nine oclock at night crying and holding her ear There was to sense a
gathering I was alone I took up my Science and Health and Bible but
the more I worked the louder she screamed Error kept suggesting
material remedies but I said firmly No I shall not go back to error
God will help me Just then I thought of my own fear how excessive it
was and a conversation I had with the Scientist who first voiced the
truth to me came to mind She said she always found it helpful to treat
herself and cast out her own fear before treating a patient I put baby
down and again took up my Science and Health and these were the words I
read 

Every trial of our faith in God makes us stronger The more difficult
seems the material condition to be overcome by Spirit the stronger
should be our faith and the purer our love The Apostle John says
There is no fear in Love but perfect Love casteth out fear  Science
and Health p 410 I looked up the crying had ceased the child was
smiling and in a few minutes asked to be put to bed There has been no
further trouble of that kind

I have since seen the power of Truth overcome error of many forms
including croup whoopingcough tonsilitis etc I am thankful for all
these proofs but far more grateful am I for the spiritual teaching to
love to forgive to curb my tongue and cease my criticism  M A H
Brockton Mass

HEALED PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY

I had been taking medicine continually for many years Finally I was
taken suddenly ill and could not leave my room for about two months
then I went away for three months thinking that I should come back and
be able to continue my work I improved very much but the fear of quick
consumption was with my doctor and my family and friends and I was
warned about the coming winter Only too soon the fear manifested
itself I had worked just three weeks when all the pains and aches
returned and I had to go to bed as soon as I got home so there was no
pleasure in living My employer advised me to see my physician and said
perhaps I should not work that winter I then and there turned to
Christian Science I could not afford to give up work and live away from
home neither did I want to depend on doctors and medicine any longer I
took the book and read it on my way to work and at noon I lay down on a
couch instead of going out for luncheon and fell asleep When I awoke I
was a different person all pains and aches had gone and I was free I
was so happy I could hardly contain myself to material sense it was
wonderful As I walked I kept saying Wonderful wonderful wonderful
and tried to understand the scientific statement of being by repeating
portions at a time then pondering over them I read the book four times
in succession and every time I found more and more to aid in the
understanding

This healing was in October l901 with no other help than Science and
Health and soon I was relieved of other chronic ailments In February I
was able to put away eyeglasses which I had worn ten years and a half
for astigmatism Oculists told me I would always have to wear them A
month later my father asked me to help him as he was suffering so much
from constipation dyspepsia and neuralgia He had been subsisting on
bran nearly starving himself until be was most miserable and his limbs
seemed so cold that they were kept wrapped in blankets I felt very
humble as he asked me and told him I would have a practitioner help
him as I had never treated any one but he would not consent to have
any one but myself and I finally told him I would try but that he must
not hold Science responsible if he were not benefited for my lack of
understanding and not Science would be at fault At my request he read
Science and Health ate whatever he wanted and used no medicine in any
form After two treatments I received word from him that he was healed
of that bondage of thirty years standing In view of all these signs
which followed my acceptance of Christian Science I knew it must be

I was delicate from childhood and my parents did not think it was
possible for me to live more than a few years I lived however
although there was not much improvement in my health Travel and change
of climate brought only temporary relief and the physicians gave me no
hope that I would ever be well

As a last resort I began the study of Science and Health and before I
had finished reading the book I realized that its author was divinely
commissioned to bring this spiritual message to a waiting world Through
this reading my health was restored and I was healed of one disease
that has been called incurable by all physicians

For this together with the greater and higher blessing of having the
spiritual fact of being unfolded to me I am most grateful

What shall be rendered for such benefits received and made possible by
the consecrated life of our revered Leader Only by following the
teachings of our textbook and by loving obedience to her gentle and
timely admonitions can we show our true sense of gratitude  F H D

HEALED AFTER MUCH SUFFERING

A testimony given in the Journal led me to investigate Christian
Science and I hope in return to be the means of leading some one else
to see the beauty of this saving truth and to learn to know God aright
and mans relationship to Him I know from experience that it is
prejudice and misapprehension of what Christian Science is that keeps
many from enjoying the blessings it bestows

I had been taking patent medicines for several years and had been to
one of the best sanitariums in this country but was not healed
although I received some benefit for which I shall always feel
grateful for I know the physicians did all they could for me I
sometimes thought I had exhausted all remedies but did not give up for
I felt there must be something to heal me if I could find it

When in this state of mind Christian Science came to my notice and
after reading several Journals I purchased a copy of Science and
Health I read for several days at odd times I commenced to improve
and in about a week I was healed of most of my ills among which were
dyspepsia and nervous debility

Although I had heard about Christian Science before I had never heard
that the reading of the Christian Science textbook had ever effected the
healing of anybody I commenced reading to find out what Christian
Science was but was surprised to find myself improving and was soon
assured that it was the theology of Science and Health that healed me
just as it was the theology of Jesus that healed the sick

It has also proved to me that there can be no Christian Science Church
that does not heal the sick and sinful for healing follows as the
natural result of the teaching of Christian Science The Bible has
become a new revelation to me and I can read it much more
understandingly by the light received through the reading of Science and
Health  A F M Fairmont Minn

THROUGH GREAT TRIBULATIONS

When I attempt to make plain what Christian Science has done for me
words fail me For twenty years I was a constant sufferer my spine
having been injured when I was very young As a little child I suffered
so much that I would look up to the stars and beg God who I thought
might be up there somewhere to take me away from the earth  I was so
tired A great wall of pain seemed to separate me from the pleasures
enjoyed by others and I could not explain how I felt because no one
could understand Years passed and I saw my earthly happiness swept
away my heart was broken and I did not know what to do I cried for
help day after day and night after night although I was not sure what
God was nor where He was I only knew that I suffered and was in need
of help and that there was no earthly help for either mind or body I
loved purity truth and right always and this made evil seem a most
terrible reality I was unable to cope with it and so found myself in
despair This was my condition when I commenced reading Science and
Health I was ready for its message and in about ten days there came a
wonderful insight into the truth which heals the sick and binds up the
brokenhearted All pain left me I had a glimpse of the new heavens and
the new earth and was beginning to be fed by Love divine

I had suffered for years with insomnia That night I rested like a
child and awoke the next morning well and happy A flood of light daily
illumined the pages of the little book and the revelation it holds
for all came to my waiting heart The peace which passeth all
understanding rested upon me and joy too deep for words transformed
my life My prayers were answered for I had found God in Christian
Science

The Bible which I knew very little about became my constant study my
joy and my guide The copy which I bought at the time of my healing is
marked from Genesis to Revelation It was so constantly in my hands for
three years that the cover became worn and the leaves loose so it has
been laid away for a new one Two and three oclock in the morning often
found me poring over its pages which grew more and more sacred to me
every day and the help I received therefrom was wonderful for which I
can find no words to express iny gratitude  I L Los Angeles Cal

A HELPFUL TESTIMONY

Words cannot express my gratitude to God for Christian Science When I
first read Science and Health I had tried every remedy I had ever heard
of I felt no change in mind or body that I was conscious of until I
read page 16 of the chapter on  Prayer in Science and Health The
first words of the spiritual sense of the Lords Prayer telling of
our FatherMother God gave me a glimpse of heavenly light I stopped
and reasoned and remembered the teachings of Jesus The truth of mans
spiritual being dawned on my consciousness I realized I was not subject
to mortal laws as I had been taught all my life I could not explain
how I knew this but I knew it Through Christian Science Mrs Eddy had
given me what I had longed for all my life  a Mother a perfect
FatherMother God I had known there was a great lack and at that
time I believe the orthodox world had but half of the truth which Jesus
came to establish When I read Give us this day our daily bread and
its spiritual interpretation my tears began to flow all the years of
bitterness hate and fear melted away I knew then as I know now that
nothing satisfies but Love That day began the outward and inward
conscious healing  mental and physical There never came a doubt I
absolutely knew that Christian Science was and is the truth Money
friends materiality are nothing beside the conscious knowledge of God
man and the universe

I did not need treatment from any one  Science and Health was so clear
and beautiful I could not understand the Bible before but I found it
illumined now that I had a little understanding of Christian Science
For ten years I have not had to lie down in the daytime from any
sickness I am now and have been all these years the picture of
perfect health When I first read Science and Health I weighed one
hundred and four pounds I now weigh over one hundred and sixty This
physical health is not to be compared to my happiness  my harmony that
nothing can take away  because it is the gift of God Nothing has
shown me the perversity of the human mind more than in its conclusions
in regard to my healing Even when I felt and knew that I was healed
people constantly said because I was thin and delicate looking  You
are not well any one could look at you and know it Now that I am
fleshy they say You dont look as if you ever had a pain in all your
life You could not have had consumption

When I think what my life was before I had Christian Science of the six
years of colds suffering and coughing not to mention the unhappiness
I want to work watch and pray  for the Mind of Christ that I may
work rightly in Gods vineyard and to know that in truth what belongs
to one belongs to all  that one God one Life Truth and Love is all

DESIRE FOR LIQUOR AND TOBACCO DISAPPEARED

I first heard of Christian Science four years ago At that time drinking
and smoking were my comforters I had no other companionship I had
lived almost constantly from childhood in an evil atmosphere Though I
was far from being satisfied with my condition I failed to see how to
better it until I read Science and Health I used occasionally to listen
to a sermon but sermons did not give me any more comfort than I derived
from my pipe hence I concluded that churchgoing could not satisfy me
and I preferred drinking and smoking When I began to read Science and
Health I saw it offered something substantial After a few months
study all desire for drinking and smoking disappeared I did not give
them up I made no sacrifices I simply found something better I might
mention that I had smoked ever since I can remember I used to smoke
years before I left school and like most Englishmen loved my pipe
and would almost prefer to miss a meal rather than to go without my
smoke I used to think it gave me comfort

During my four years study of Christian Science I have not spent a cent
for doctors or medicine neither have I lost a day from my work on
account of sickness which compares wonderfully with the previous four
years I take a great interest and pleasure in reading the Bible and
studying the lessons in the Quarterly The Bible used to be a most
mysterious book to me but Science and Health makes it a most precious
book making its meaning clearer plainer and simpler

I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mrs Eddy and to the
friend who invited me to attend the service held in the Auditorium years
ago I also wish to acknowledge the benefit I have had from the Journal
and the Sentinel They have helped me wonderfully If the value of
Science and Health and these publications were measured as business men
value things by the results or benefits they bring they certainly
would be priceless to me It would be impossible to measure their value
as I have got something from Science and Health that all the money in
the world could not buy  H P H Chicago Ill

AN EXPRESSION OF LOVING GRATITUDE

In the spring of 1893 while studying for the ministry Science and
Health was placed in my hands and the truth contained therein at once
became to me the pearl of great price I literally devoured the book
reading it about eighteen hours a day Its originality was startling
upsetting my preconceived opinions of God man and creation Two
sentences especially appealed to me The foundation of mortal discord
is a false sense of mans origin p 262 and For right
reasoning there should be but one fact before the thought namely
spiritual existence  p 492 I had found the keynote to the Science
of being as taught in this marvellous book and persevered until a
glimpse of the new heavens and new earth came for the old were passing
away With this spiritual uplifting came also physical health

All my life had been spent in semiinvalidism and I seemed destined to
a life of suffering In three weeks after beginning Science and Health
to my joyful surprise I found myself a well man sound physically and
uplifted spiritually Life was being lived from a new basis the old
things of personal sense were passing away and all things becoming new
I learned that the infinite good is the one Friend upon whom we can call
at all times an allpowerful everpresent help in every time of
trouble that His children are really governed in peace and harmony by
spiritual law and as the right understanding of it is gained the other
things soon follow bringing a peace the human concept can never know

For the last twelve years my whole time has been devoted to Christian
Science practice and I have seen nearly every socalled incurable
disease healed by its beneficent influence God bless our dear Leader
She has set before us an open door which no man can shut and it is but
a question of time when the world will know her better and love her

HEALED OF BRIGHTS DISEASE

August 18 1902 I was taken down with what three doctors pronounced
Brights disease and they stated that I would not live a year or if I
did succeed in living longer I would be mentally unbalanced On
December 6 1902 my wife presented me with Science and Health as a
birthday gift and it was indeed the best present I ever received Since
that time I have been reading it and attending the Second Church here I
have not used any medicine since nor has any one in our home I am in
the finest of health and have lost all my bad habits This truth has
brought a great spiritual uplifting to all of us and words cannot
express my gratitude to Mrs Eddy and to all who have helped me to the
same  T V Chicago Ill

FIBROID TUMOR DESTROYED

When quite young I was impressed that the Bible was not properly
interpreted by the preachers for I could not conceive of a God of wrath
who was unjust enough to allow His little ones to suffer pain misery
and death I had hope however that some day the truth would be
revealed to an awakening world but little did I dream that even then
there was one of Gods noble women who reflected sufficient purity and
holiness to entertain the angel of his presence and commune with the
true God

I was believed to be predisposed to scrofula so that I was not a strong
or attractive child and my girlhood and womanhood were scarcely ever
free from dread of the laws of matter and lack of strength The climax
was reached when a physician informed me after weeks of treatment that
I had a fibroid tumor which required an operation The conditions were
most trying and I was heartsick and discouraged when in January 1893 I
heard of Christian Science through a letter from a dear sister who had been
greatly benefited thereby and I resolved to go at once to a
practitioner for I believed it to be the longlost truth that would
make me free It meant a great effort and sacrifice for me to go to
Chicago at that time but divine Love opened the way and I reached there
in March I had been in my sisters home but a few days reading Science
and Health almost constantly when I asked her if I had not better have
treatment for the tumor which had given me so much trouble She said to
me You feel well do you not I assured her that I never had felt so
well as I had since reaching there Well she said with decision
your tumor is gone for God never made it and her statements were
true for it has never been heard of from that day Since then I have
been healed of chronic sore throat hay fever and other troubles and I
know that Christian Science is the truth  B W S Coldwater Mich

LIGHT OUT OF DARKNESS

I have received so much benefit from the testimonies in the Sentinel
and Journal that I send mine hoping it may cheer some struggling
heart I was reared by kind and loving Christian parents and was a
member of an orthodox church for over twenty years but I was never
satisfied I was filled with fear and bound down by the false gods of
this world  sin disease and poverty consequently every way I
turned and in everything I attempted to do I was met with
disappointment and failure but God was leading me into a different
life

My interest was first awakened to Christian Science about thirteen years
ago and I have been a willing disciple ever since Through the reading
of Science and Health I was healed of chronic catarrh and laryngitis
and it also enabled me to lay off my glasses Christian Science has not
only helped me mentally morally and physically but the greatest
blessing of all is the spiritual uplifting which enabled me to know that
God is both able and willing to care for His children if we are but
willing to do our part and bear the cross which though it seems heavy
at times always brings a sure reward Christian Science has not only
helped me but it has enabled me to help others

The Bible is a new book to me I now see what Jesus meant when he said
Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give
you rest

My heart goes out in gratitude to Mrs Eddy for the work she has done
and is still doing for the world and to God I am most grateful that He
has guided me into the truth that I may have life and have it more
abundantly  Mrs M M Chicago Ill

A PRICELESS BOON

I have long desired to express my gratitude for what Christian Science
has done through reading Science and Health for me and my family I
was healed of profanity the tobacco habit and a bad temper through
the understanding that man is the image and likeness of God I was also
healed of kidney disease and rheumatism What surprised me most
however was this I had had one finger thrown out of place some fifteen
years before It was crooked but it became straight and useful A bone
in my foot had also been broken leaving a bunch which disappeared
after I studied Christian Science and received class instruction I am
an entirely well man and for this I am very grateful I am also glad
that I have learned enough of Truth and love to be able to heal others
I wish to express my thankful appreciation of our Leader also of the
Sentinel and the Journal  N R F Salina Kans

HEALED OF CONSUMPTION AND ASTHMA

It is a pleasure to acknowledge the great benefits which have come to me
through Christian Science It is nearly ten years since I began the
investigation of the subject by borrowing a copy of Science and Health
I had become a hopeless sufferer from asthma  the disease being so
aggravated at times as to make breathing almost impossible I was also a
victim of that dread disease consumption It was hereditary nearly all
my family on both sides having passed away with it I took up Christian
Science very much as a drowning man catches at a straw However I was
much interested as soon as I began to understand it and having read the
book nearly all my waking hours for a few weeks I became so much better
and so convinced of its truth that myself and wife destroyed all the
medicines in the home and have never since used any remedy except
Christian Science I continued to study and to put into practice the
teaching as best I knew and was restored to health in a few months

Prior to my investigation of Christian Science I had been from boyhood
an outspoken infidel had read that class of literature extensively and
had no desire for anything of a religious nature  the orthodox
teaching never having appealed to me as a rational exposition of an
allwise God I now have no more doubt of the truth of the teaching of
the great Wayshower Jesus of Nazareth than I doubt the correctness of
the basic law of mathematics or music I have no doubt whatever that
Christian Science saved me from the grave and thus proved a most
practicable and efficient help in time of greatest need However great
my physical suffering has been I can but feel glad that through it the
door of consciousness was opened to let in the light of Truth Thus I
have progressed a little way in the knowledge of God good as revealed
in Christian Science  C B Webb City Mo

A GRATEFUL TESTIMONY

Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path 

This has been proven to me in every way When Christian Science came to
me I was a wreck physically mentally and financially but since the
reading of Science and Health turned my thought toward the light I have
found that as far as I am willing to receive the word and live it all
comforts are supplied me I am especially grateful for the spiritual
help I know that things which I did and thought last year I would not
do or think this year and am satisfied Through the careful and
prayerful study of Science and Health I have been lifted from sickness
to health from sorrow to peace from lack to plenty and the most
beautiful of all from darkness to light  Mrs H S C Seattle Wash
