YOU NEVER CAN TELL

By George Bernard Shaw




ACT I

In a dentists operating room on a fine August morning in 1896 Not the
usual tiny London den but the best sitting room of a furnished lodging
in a terrace on the sea front at a fashionable watering place The
operating chair with a gas pump and cylinder beside it is half way
between the centre of the room and one of the corners If you look into
the room through the window which lights it you will see the fireplace
in the middle of the wall opposite you with the door beside it to your
left an MRCS diploma in a frame hung on the chimneypiece an easy
chair covered in black leather on the hearth a neat stool and bench
with vice tools and a mortar and pestle in the corner to the right
Near this bench stands a slender machine like a whip provided with a
stand a pedal and an exaggerated winch Recognising this as a dental
drill you shudder and look away to your left where you can see another
window underneath which stands a writing table with a blotter and a
diary on it and a chair Next the writing table towards the door is
a leather covered sofa The opposite wall close on your right is
occupied mostly by a bookcase The operating chair is under your nose
facing you with the cabinet of instruments handy to it on your left
You observe that the professional furniture and apparatus are new
and that the wall paper designed with the taste of an undertaker
in festoons and urns the carpet with its symmetrical plans of rich
cabbagy nosegays the glass gasalier with lustres the ornamental gilt
rimmed blue candlesticks on the ends of the mantelshelf also glass
draped with lustres and the ormolu clock under a glasscover in the
middle between them its uselessness emphasized by a cheap American
clock disrespectfully placed beside it and now indicating 12 oclock
noon all combine with the black marble which gives the fireplace the
air of a miniature family vault to suggest early Victorian commercial
respectability belief in money Bible fetichism fear of hell always at
war with fear of poverty instinctive horror of the passionate character
of art love and Roman Catholic religion and all the first fruits of
plutocracy in the early generations of the industrial revolution

There is no shadow of this on the two persons who are occupying the room
just now One of them a very pretty woman in miniature her tiny figure
dressed with the daintiest gaiety is of a later generation being
hardly eighteen yet This darling little creature clearly does not
belong to the room or even to the country for her complexion though
very delicate has been burnt biscuit color by some warmer sun than
Englands and yet there is for a very subtle observer a link between
them For she has a glass of water in her hand and a rapidly clearing
cloud of Spartan obstinacy on her tiny firm set mouth and quaintly
squared eyebrows If the least line of conscience could be traced
between those eyebrows an Evangelical might cherish some faint hope
of finding her a sheep in wolfs clothingfor her frock is recklessly
prettybut as the cloud vanishes it leaves her frontal sinus as
smoothly free from conviction of sin as a kittens

The dentist contemplating her with the selfsatisfaction of a
successful operator is a young man of thirty or thereabouts He does
not give the impression of being much of a workman his professional
manner evidently strikes him as being a joke and is underlain by a
thoughtless pleasantry which betrays the young gentleman still unsettled
and in search of amusing adventures behind the newly setup dentist
in search of patients He is not without gravity of demeanor but the
strained nostrils stamp it as the gravity of the humorist His eyes are
clear alert of sceptically moderate size and yet a little rash his
forehead is an excellent one with plenty of room behind it his nose
and chin cavalierly handsome On the whole an attractive noticeable
beginner of whose prospects a man of business might form a tolerably
favorable estimate

THE YOUNG LADY handing him the glass Thank you In spite of the
biscuit complexion she has not the slightest foreign accent

THE DENTIST putting it down on the ledge of his cabinet of
instruments That was my first tooth

THE YOUNG LADY aghast Your first Do you mean to say that you began
practising on me

THE DENTIST Every dentist has to begin on somebody

THE YOUNG LADY Yes somebody in a hospital not people who pay

THE DENTIST laughing Oh the hospital doesnt count I only meant my
first tooth in private practice Why didnt you let me give you gas

THE YOUNG LADY Because you said it would be five shillings extra

THE DENTIST shocked Oh dont say that It makes me feel as if I had
hurt you for the sake of five shillings

THE YOUNG LADY with cool insolence Well so you have She gets up
Why shouldnt you its your business to hurt people It amuses him to
be treated in this fashion he chuckles secretly as he proceeds to clean
and replace his instruments She shakes her dress into order looks
inquisitively about her and goes to the window You have a good view
of the sea from these rooms Are they expensive

THE DENTIST Yes

THE YOUNG LADY You dont own the whole house do you

THE DENTIST No

THE YOUNG LADY taking the chair which stands at the writingtable
and looking critically at it as she spins it round on one leg Your
furniture isnt quite the latest thing is it

THE DENTIST Its my landlords

THE YOUNG LADY Does he own that nice comfortable Bath chair pointing
to the operating chair

THE DENTIST No I have that on the hirepurchase system

THE YOUNG LADY disparagingly I thought so Looking about her again
in search of further conclusions I suppose you havent been here long

THE DENTIST Six weeks Is there anything else you would like to know

THE YOUNG LADY the hint quite lost on her Any family

THE DENTIST I am not married

THE YOUNG LADY Of course not anybody can see that I meant sisters and
mother and that sort of thing

THE DENTIST Not on the premises

THE YOUNG LADY Hm If youve been here six weeks and mine was your
first tooth the practice cant be very large can it

THE DENTIST Not as yet He shuts the cabinet having tidied up
everything

THE YOUNG LADY Well good luck She takes our her purse Five
shillings you said it would be

THE DENTIST Five shillings

THE YOUNG LADY producing a crown piece Do you charge five shillings
for everything

THE DENTIST Yes

THE YOUNG LADY Why

THE DENTIST Its my system Im whats called a five shilling dentist

THE YOUNG LADY How nice Well here holding up the crown piece a
nice new five shilling piece your first fee Make a hole in it with the
thing you drill peoples teeth with and wear it on your watchchain

THE DENTIST Thank you

THE PARLOR MAID appearing at the door The young ladys brother sir

A handsome man in miniature obviously the young ladys twin comes
in eagerly He wears a suit of terracotta cashmere the elegantly cut
frock coat lined in brown silk and carries in his hand a brown tall
hat and tan gloves to match He has his sisters delicate biscuit
complexion and is built on the same small scale but he is elastic
and strong in muscle decisive in movement unexpectedly deeptoned and
trenchant in speech and with perfect manners and a finished personal
style which might be envied by a man twice his age Suavity and
selfpossession are points of honor with him and though this rightly
considered is only the modern mode of boyish selfconsciousness
its effect is none the less staggering to his elders and would be
insufferable in a less prepossessing youth He is promptitude itself
and has a question ready the moment he enters

THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN Am I on time

THE YOUNG LADY No its all over

THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN Did you howl

THE YOUNG LADY Oh something awful Mr Valentine this is my brother
Phil Phil this is Mr Valentine our new dentist Valentine and Phil
bow to one another She proceeds all in one breath Hes only been
here six weeks and hes a bachelor The house isnt his and the
furniture is the landlords but the professional plant is hired He
got my tooth out beautifully at the first go and he and I are great
friends

PHILIP Been asking a lot of questions

THE YOUNG LADY as if incapable of doing such a thing Oh no

PHILIP Glad to hear it To Valentine So good of you not to mind us
Mr Valentine The fact is weve never been in England before and our
mother tells us that the people here simply wont stand us Come and
lunch with us Valentine bewildered by the leaps and bounds with which
their acquaintanceship is proceeding gasps but he has no opportunity
of speaking as the conversation of the twins is swift and continuous

THE YOUNG LADY Oh do Mr Valentine

PHILIP At the Marine Hotelhalf past one

THE YOUNG LADY We shall be able to tell mamma that a respectable
Englishman has promised to lunch with us

PHILIP Say no more Mr Valentine youll come

VALENTINE Say no more I havent said anything May I ask whom I have
the pleasure of entertaining Its really quite impossible for me to
lunch at the Marine Hotel with two perfect strangers

THE YOUNG LADY flippantly Ooooh what bosh One patient in six weeks
What difference does it make to you

PHILIP maturely No Dolly my knowledge of human nature confirms
Mr Valentines judgment He is right Let me introduce Miss Dorothy
Clandon commonly called Dolly Valentine bows to Dolly She nods to
him Im Philip Clandon Were from Madeira but perfectly respectable
so far

VALENTINE Clandon Are you related to

DOLLY unexpectedly crying out in despair Yes we are

VALENTINE astonished I beg your pardon

DOLLY Oh we are we are Its all over Phil they know all about us
in England To Valentine Oh you cant think how maddening it is to
be related to a celebrated person and never be valued anywhere for our
own sakes

VALENTINE But excuse me the gentleman I was thinking of is not
celebrated

DOLLY staring at him Gentleman Phil is also puzzled

VALENTINE Yes I was going to ask whether you were by any chance a
daughter of Mr Densmore Clandon of Newbury Hall

DOLLY vacantly No

PHILIP Well come Dolly how do you know youre not

DOLLY cheered Oh I forgot Of course Perhaps I am

VALENTINE Dont you know

PHILIP Not in the least

DOLLY Its a wise child

PHILIP cutting her short Sh Valentine starts nervously for the
sound made by Philip though but momentary is like cutting a sheet of
silk in two with a flash of lightning It is the result of long practice
in checking Dollys indiscretions The fact is Mr Valentine we are
the children of the celebrated Mrs Lanfrey Clandon an authoress of
great reputein Madeira No household is complete without her works
We came to England to get away from them The are called the Twentieth
Century Treatises

DOLLY Twentieth Century Cooking

PHILIP Twentieth Century Creeds

DOLLY Twentieth Century Clothing

PHILIP Twentieth Century Conduct

DOLLY Twentieth Century Children

PHILIP Twentieth Century Parents

DOLLY Cloth limp half a dollar

PHILIP Or mounted on linen for hard family use two dollars No family
should be without them Read them Mr Valentine theyll improve your
mind

DOLLY But not till weve gone please

PHILIP Quite so we prefer people with unimproved minds Our own minds
are in that fresh and unspoiled condition

VALENTINE dubiously Hm

DOLLY echoing him inquiringly Hm Phil he prefers people whose minds
are improved

PHILIP In that case we shall have to introduce him to the other member
of the family the Woman of the Twentieth Century our sister Gloria

DOLLY dithyrambically Natures masterpiece

PHILIP Learnings daughter

DOLLY Madeiras pride

PHILIP Beautys paragon

DOLLY suddenly descending to prose Bosh No complexion

VALENTINE desperately May I have a word

PHILIP politely Excuse us Go ahead

DOLLY very nicely So sorry

VALENTINE attempting to take them paternally I really must give a
hint to you young people

DOLLY breaking out again Oh come I like that How old are you

PHILIP Over thirty

DOLLY Hes not

PHILIP confidently He is

DOLLY emphatically Twentyseven

PHILIP imperturbably Thirtythree

DOLLY Stuff

PHILIP to Valentine I appeal to you Mr Valentine

VALENTINE remonstrating Well reallyresigning himself
Thirtyone

PHILIP to Dolly You were wrong

DOLLY So were you

PHILIP suddenly conscientious Were forgetting our manners Dolly

DOLLY remorseful Yes so we are

PHILIP apologetic We interrupted you Mr Valentine

DOLLY You were going to improve our minds I think

VALENTINE The fact is your

PHILIP anticipating him Our appearance

DOLLY Our manners

VALENTINE ad misericordiam Oh do let me speak

DOLLY The old story We talk too much

PHILIP We do Shut up both He seats himself on the arm of the
opposing chair

DOLLY Mum She sits down in the writingtable chair and closes her
lips tight with the tips of her fingers

VALENTINE Thank you He brings the stool from the bench in the corner
places it between them and sits down with a judicial air They attend
to him with extreme gravity He addresses himself first to Dolly
Now may I ask to begin with have you ever been in an English seaside
resort before She shakes her head slowly and solemnly He turns to
Phil who shakes his head quickly and expressively I thought so Well
Mr Clandon our acquaintance has been short but it has been voluble
and I have gathered enough to convince me that you are neither of you
capable of conceiving what life in an English seaside resort is Believe
me its not a question of manners and appearance In those respects we
enjoy a freedom unknown in Madeira Dolly shakes her head
vehemently Oh yes I assure you Lord de Crescis sister bicycles in
knickerbockers and the rectors wife advocates dress reform and wears
hygienic boots Dolly furtively looks at her own shoe Valentine
catches her in the act and deftly adds No thats not the sort of boot
I mean Dollys shoe vanishes We dont bother much about dress and
manners in England because as a nation we dont dress well and weve
no manners Butand now will you excuse my frankness They nod Thank
you Well in a seaside resort theres one thing you must have before
anybody can afford to be seen going about with you and thats a father
alive or dead He looks at them alternately with emphasis They
meet his gaze like martyrs Am I to infer that you have omitted that
indispensable part of your social equipment They confirm him by
melancholy nods Them Im sorry to say that if you are going to stay
here for any length of time it will be impossible for me to accept
your kind invitation to lunch He rises with an air of finality and
replaces the stool by the bench

PHILIP rising with grave politeness Come Dolly He gives her his
arm

DOLLY Good morning They go together to the door with perfect
dignity

VALENTINE overwhelmed with remorse Oh stop stop They halt and
turn arm in arm You make me feel a perfect beast

DOLLY Thats your conscience not us

VALENTINE energetically throwing off all pretence of a professional
manner My conscience My conscience has been my ruin Listen to me
Twice before I have set up as a respectable medical practitioner in
various parts of England On both occasions I acted conscientiously and
told my patients the brute truth instead of what they wanted to be told
Result ruin Now Ive set up as a dentist a five shilling dentist and
Ive done with conscience forever This is my last chance I spent my
last sovereign on moving in and I havent paid a shilling of rent yet
Im eating and drinking on credit my landlord is as rich as a Jew and
as hard as nails and Ive made five shillings in six weeks If I
swerve by a hairs breadth from the straight line of the most rigid
respectability Im done for Under such a circumstance is it fair to
ask me to lunch with you when you dont know your own father

DOLLY After all our grandfather is a canon of Lincoln Cathedral

VALENTINE like a castaway mariner who sees a sail on the horizon
What Have you a grandfather

DOLLY Only one

VALENTINE My dear good young friends why on earth didnt you tell me
that before A cannon of Lincoln That makes it all right of course
Just excuse me while I change my coat He reaches the door in a bound
and vanishes Dolly and Phil stare after him and then stare at one
another Missing their audience they droop and become commonplace at
once

PHILIP throwing away Dollys arm and coming illhumoredly towards
the operating chair That wretched bankrupt ivory snatcher makes a
compliment of allowing us to stand him a lunchprobably the first
square meal he has had for months He gives the chair a kick as if it
were Valentine

DOLLY Its too beastly I wont stand it any longer Phil Here in
England everybody asks whether you have a father the very first thing

PHILIP I wont stand it either Mamma must tell us who he was

DOLLY Or who he is He may be alive

PHILIP I hope not No man alive shall father me

DOLLY He might have a lot of money though

PHILIP I doubt it My knowledge of human nature leads me to believe
that if he had a lot of money he wouldnt have got rid of his
affectionate family so easily Anyhow lets look at the bright side of
things Depend on it hes dead He goes to the hearth and stands with
his back to the fireplace spreading himself The parlor maid appears
The twins under observation instantly shine out again with their
former brilliancy

THE PARLOR MAID Two ladies for you miss Your mother and sister miss
I think

Mrs Clandon and Gloria come in Mrs Clandon is between forty and
fifty with a slight tendency to soft sedentary fat and a fair
remainder of good looks none the worse preserved because she has
evidently followed the old tribal matronly fashion of making no
pretension in that direction after her marriage and might almost be
suspected of wearing a cap at home She carries herself artificially
well as women were taught to do as a part of good manners by dancing
masters and reclining boards before these were superseded by the modern
artistic cult of beauty and health Her hair a flaxen hazel fading into
white is crimped and parted in the middle with the ends plaited and
made into a knot from which observant people of a certain age infer
that Mrs Clandon had sufficient individuality and good taste to stand
out resolutely against the now forgotten chignon in her girlhood In
short she is distinctly old fashioned for her age in dress and manners
But she belongs to the forefront of her own period say 186080 in a
jealously assertive attitude of character and intellect and in being
a woman of cultivated interests rather than passionately developed
personal affections Her voice and ways are entirely kindly and humane
and she lends herself conscientiously to the occasional demonstrations
of fondness by which her children mark their esteem for her but
displays of personal sentiment secretly embarrass her passion in her
is humanitarian rather than human she feels strongly about social
questions and principles not about persons Only one observes that
this reasonableness and intense personal privacy which leaves her
relations with Gloria and Phil much as they might be between her and the
children of any other woman breaks down in the case of Dolly Though
almost every word she addresses to her is necessarily in the nature of a
remonstrance for some breach of decorum the tenderness in her voice is
unmistakable and it is not surprising that years of such remonstrance
have left Dolly hopelessly spoiled

Gloria who is hardly past twenty is a much more formidable person than
her mother She is the incarnation of haughty highmindedness raging
with the impatience of an impetuous dominative character paralyzed by
the impotence of her youth and unwillingly disciplined by the constant
danger of ridicule from her lighterhanded juniors Unlike her mother
she is all passion and the conflict of her passion with her obstinate
pride and intense fastidiousness results in a freezing coldness of
manner In an ugly woman all this would be repulsive but Gloria is
an attractive woman Her deep chestnut hair olive brown skin long
eyelashes shaded grey eyes that often flash like stars delicately
turned full lips and compact and supple but muscularly plump figure
appeal with disdainful frankness to the senses and imagination A very
dangerous girl one would say if the moral passions were not also
marked and even nobly marked in a fine brow Her tailormade
skirtandjacket dress of saffron brown cloth seems conventional when
her back is turned but it displays in front a blouse of seagreen silk
which upsets its conventionality with one stroke and sets her apart as
effectually as the twins from the ordinary run of fashionable seaside
humanity

Mrs Clandon comes a little way into the room looking round to see
who is present Gloria who studiously avoids encouraging the twins by
betraying any interest in them wanders to the window and looks out with
her thoughts far away The parlor maid instead of withdrawing shuts
the door and waits at it

MRS CLANDON Well children How is the toothache Dolly

DOLLY Cured thank Heaven Ive had it out She sits down on the step
of the operating chair Mrs Clandon takes the writingtable chair

PHILIP striking in gravely from the hearth And the dentist a
firstrate professional man of the highest standing is coming to lunch
with us

MRS CLANDON looking round apprehensively at the servant Phil

THE PARLOR MAID Beg pardon maam Im waiting for Mr Valentine I
have a message for him

DOLLY Who from

MRS CLANDON shocked Dolly Dolly catches her lips with her finger
tips suppressing a little splutter of mirth

THE PARLOR MAID Only the landlord maam

Valentine in a blue serge suit with a straw hat in his hand comes
back in high spirits out of breath with the haste he has made Gloria
turns from the window and studies him with freezing attention

PHILIP Let me introduce you Mr Valentine My mother Mrs Lanfrey
Clandon Mrs Clandon bows Valentine bows selfpossessed and quite
equal to the occasion My sister Gloria Gloria bows with cold dignity
and sits down on the sofa Valentine falls in love at first sight and
is miserably confused He fingers his hat nervously and makes her a
sneaking bow

MRS CLANDON I understand that we are to have the pleasure of seeing
you at luncheon today Mr Valentine

VALENTINE Thank youerif you dont mindI mean if you will be so
kindto the parlor maid testily What is it

THE PARLOR MAID The landlord sir wishes to speak to you before you go
out

VALENTINE Oh tell him I have four patients here The Clandons look
surprised except Phil who is imperturbable If he wouldnt mind
waiting just two minutes IIll slip down and see him for a moment
Throwing himself confidentially on her sense of the position Say Im
busy but that I want to see him

THE PARLOR MAID reassuringly Yes sir She goes

MRS CLANDON on the point of rising We are detaining you I am
afraid

VALENTINE Not at all not at all Your presence here will be the
greatest help to me The fact is I owe six weeks rent and Ive had
no patients until today My interview with my landlord will be
considerably smoothed by the apparent boom in my business

DOLLY vexed Oh how tiresome of you to let it all out And weve
just been pretending that you were a respectable professional man in a
firstrate position

MRS CLANDON horrified Oh Dolly Dolly My dearest how can you be
so rude To Valentine Will you excuse these barbarian children of
mine Mr Valentine

VALENTINE Thank you Im used to them Would it be too much to ask you
to wait five minutes while I get rid of my landlord downstairs

DOLLY Dont be long Were hungry

MRS CLANDON again remonstrating Dolly dear

VALENTINE to Dolly All right To Mrs Clandon Thank you I shant
be long He steals a look at Gloria as he turns to go She is looking
gravely at him He falls into confusion Iereryesthank you
he succeeds at last in blundering himself out of the room but the
exhibition is a pitiful one

PHILIP Did you observe Pointing to Gloria Love at first sight You
can add his scalp to your collection Gloria

MRS CLANDON Shsh pray Phil He may have heard you

PHILIP Not he Bracing himself for a scene And now look here mamma
He takes the stool from the bench and seats himself majestically in
the middle of the room taking a leaf out of Valentines book Dolly
feeling that her position on the step of the operating chair is unworthy
of the dignity of the occasion rises looking important and determined
crosses to the window and stands with her back to the end of the
writingtable her hands behind her and on the table Mrs Clandon looks
at them wondering what is coming Gloria becomes attentive Philip
straightens his back places his knuckles symmetrically on his knees
and opens his case Dolly and I have been talking over things a good
deal lately and I dont think judging from my knowledge of human
naturewe dont think that you speaking very staccato with the words
detached quite appreciate the fact

DOLLY seating herself on the end of the table with a spring That
weve grown up

MRS CLANDON Indeed In what way have I given you any reason to
complain

PHILIP Well there are certain matters upon which we are beginning to
feel that you might take us a little more into your confidence

MRS CLANDON rising with all the placidity of her age suddenly broken
up and a curious hard excitement dignified but dogged ladylike
but implacablethe manner of the Old Guard of the Womens Rights
movementcoming upon her Phil take care Remember what I have
always taught you There are two sorts of family life Phil and
your experience of human nature only extends so far to one of them
Rhetorically The sort you know is based on mutual respect
on recognition of the right of every member of the household to
independence and privacy her emphasis on privacy is intense in their
personal concerns And because you have always enjoyed that it seems
such a matter of course to you that you dont value it But with biting
acrimony there is another sort of family life a life in which husbands
open their wives letters and call on them to account for every
farthing of their expenditure and every moment of their time in which
women do the same to their children in which no room is private and
no hour sacred in which duty obedience affection home morality
and religion are detestable tyrannies and life is a vulgar round of
punishments and lies coercion and rebellion jealousy suspicion
recriminationOh I cannot describe it to you fortunately for you you
know nothing about it She sits down panting Gloria has listened to
her with flashing eyes sharing all her indignation

DOLLY inaccessible to rhetoric See Twentieth Century Parents chapter
on Liberty passim

MRS CLANDON touching her shoulder affectionately soothed even by a
gibe from her My dear Dolly if you only knew how glad I am that it is
nothing but a joke to you though it is such bitter earnest to me More
resolutely turning to Philip Phil I never ask you questions about
your private concerns You are not going to question me are you

PHILIP I think it due to ourselves to say that the question we wanted
to ask is as much our business as yours

DOLLY Besides it cant be good to keep a lot of questions bottled up
inside you You did it mamma but see how awfully its broken out again
in me

MRS CLANDON I see you want to ask your question Ask it

DOLLY AND PHILIP beginning simultaneously Who They stop

PHILIP Now look here Dolly am I going to conduct this business or are
you

DOLLY You

PHILIP Then hold your mouth Dolly does so literally The question is
a simple one When the ivory snatcher

MRS CLANDON remonstrating Phil

PHILIP Dentist is an ugly word The man of ivory and gold asked us
whether we were the children of Mr Densmore Clandon of Newbury Hall In
pursuance of the precepts in your treatise on Twentieth Century Conduct
and your repeated personal exhortations to us to curtail the number of
unnecessary lies we tell we replied truthfully the we didnt know

DOLLY Neither did we

PHILIP Sh The result was that the gum architect made considerable
difficulties about accepting our invitation to lunch although I doubt
if he has had anything but tea and bread and butter for a fortnight
past Now my knowledge of human nature leads me to believe that we had a
father and that you probably know who he was

MRS CLANDON her agitation returning Stop Phil Your father is
nothing to you nor to me vehemently That is enough The twins are
silenced but not satisfied Their faces fall But Gloria who has been
following the altercation attentively suddenly intervenes

GLORIA advancing Mother we have a right to know

MRS CLANDON rising and facing her Gloria We Who is we

GLORIA steadfastly We three Her tone is unmistakable she is
pitting her strength against her mother for the first time The twins
instantly go over to the enemy

MRS CLANDON wounded In your mouth we used to mean you and I
Gloria

PHILIP rising decisively and putting away the stool Were hurting
you lets drop it We didnt think youd mind I dont want to know

DOLLY coming off the table Im sure I dont Oh dont look like
that mamma She looks angrily at Gloria

MRS CLANDON touching her eyes hastily with her handkerchief and
sitting down again Thank you my dear Thanks Phil

GLORIA inexorably We have a right to know mother

MRS CLANDON indignantly Ah You insist

GLORIA Do you intend that we shall never know

DOLLY Oh Gloria dont Its barbarous

GLORIA with quiet scorn What is the use of being weak You see
what has happened with this gentleman here mother The same thing has
happened to me

MRS CLANDON  all  What do you mean

DOLLY  together  Oh tell us

PHILIP   What happened to you

GLORIA Oh nothing of any consequence She turns away from them and
goes up to the easy chair at the fireplace where she sits down almost
with her back to them As they wait expectantly she adds over her
shoulder with studied indifference On board the steamer the first
officer did me the honor to propose to me

DOLLY No it was to me

MRS CLANDON The first officer Are you serious Gloria What did you
say to him correcting herself Excuse me I have no right to ask that

GLORIA The answer is pretty obvious A woman who does not know who her
father was cannot accept such an offer

MRS CLANDON Surely you did not want to accept it

GLORIA turning a little and raising her voice No but suppose I had
wanted to

PHILIP Did that difficulty strike you Dolly

DOLLY No I accepted him

GLORIA  all crying  Accepted him

MRS CLANDON  out  Dolly

PHILIP  together  Oh I say

DOLLY naively He did look such a fool

MRS CLANDON But why did you do such a thing Dolly

DOLLY For fun I suppose He had to measure my finger for a ring Youd
have done the same thing yourself

MRS CLANDON No Dolly I would not As a matter of fact the first
officer did propose to me and I told him to keep that sort of thing for
women were young enough to be amused by it He appears to have acted on
my advice She rises and goes to the hearth Gloria I am sorry you
think me weak but I cannot tell you what you want You are all too
young

PHILIP This is rather a startling departure from Twentieth Century
principles

DOLLY quoting Answer all your childrens questions and answer them
truthfully as soon as they are old enough to ask them See Twentieth
Century Motherhood

PHILIP Page one

DOLLY Chapter one

PHILIP Sentence one

MRS CLANDON My dears I did not say that you were too young to know
I said you were too young to be taken into my confidence You are very
bright children all of you but I am glad for your sakes that you are
still very inexperienced and consequently very unsympathetic There are
some experiences of mine that I cannot bear to speak of except to those
who have gone through what I have gone through I hope you will never
be qualified for such confidences But I will take care that you shall
learn all you want to know Will that satisfy you

PHILIP Another grievance Dolly

DOLLY Were not sympathetic

GLORIA leaning forward in her chair and looking earnestly up at her
mother Mother I did not mean to be unsympathetic

MRS CLANDON affectionately Of course not dear Do you think I dont
understand

GLORIA rising But mother

MRS CLANDON drawing back a little Yes

GLORIA obstinately It is nonsense to tell us that our father is
nothing to us

MRS CLANDON provoked to sudden resolution Do you remember your
father

GLORIA meditatively as if the recollection were a tender one I am
not quite sure I think so

MRS CLANDON grimly You are not sure

GLORIA No

MRS CLANDON with quiet force Gloria if I had ever struck you
Gloria recoils Philip and Dolly are disagreeably shocked all
three start at her revolted as she continuesstruck you purposely
deliberately with the intention of hurting you with a whip bought for
the purpose Would you remember that do you think Gloria utters an
exclamation of indignant repulsion That would have been your last
recollection of your father Gloria if I had not taken you away from
him I have kept him out of your life keep him now out of mine by never
mentioning him to me again Gloria with a shudder covers her face
with her hands until hearing someone at the door she turns away and
pretends to occupy herself looking at the names of the books in the
bookcase Mrs Clandon sits down on the sofa Valentine returns

VALENTINE I hope Ive not kept you waiting That landlord of mine is
really an extraordinary old character

DOLLY eagerly Oh tell us How long has he given you to pay

MRS CLANDON distracted by her childs bad manners Dolly Dolly
Dolly dear You must not ask questions

DOLLY demurely So sorry Youll tell us wont you Mr Valentine

VALENTINE He doesnt want his rent at all Hes broken his tooth on
a Brazil nut and he wants me to look at it and to lunch with him
afterwards

DOLLY Then have him up and pull his tooth out at once and well bring
him to lunch too Tell the maid to fetch him along She runs to the
bell and rings it vigorously Then with a sudden doubt she turns to
Valentine and adds I suppose hes respectablereally respectable

VALENTINE Perfectly Not like me

DOLLY Honest Injun Mrs Clandon gasps faintly but her powers of
remonstrance are exhausted

VALENTINE Honest Injun

DOLLY Then off with you and bring him up

VALENTINE looking dubiously at Mrs Clandon I daresay hed be
delighted ifer

MRS CLANDON rising and looking at her watch I shall be happy to see
your friend at lunch if you can persuade him to come but I cant wait
to see him now I have an appointment at the hotel at a quarter to one
with an old friend whom I have not seen since I left England eighteen
years ago Will you excuse me

VALENTINE Certainly Mrs Clandon

GLORIA Shall I come

MRS CLANDON No dear I want to be alone She goes out evidently
still a good deal troubled Valentine opens the door for her and follows
her out

PHILIP significantlyto Dolly Hmhm

DOLLY significantly to Philip Ahah The parlor maid answers the
bell

DOLLY Show the old gentleman up

THE PARLOR MAID puzzled Madam

DOLLY The old gentleman with the toothache

PHILIP The landlord

THE PARLOR MAID Mr Crampton Sir

PHILIP Is his name Crampton

DOLLY to Philip Sounds rheumaticky doesnt it

PHILIP Chalkstones probably

DOLLY over her shoulder to the parlor maid Show Mr Crampstones up
Goes R to writingtable chair

THE PARLOR MAID correcting her Mr Crampton miss She goes

DOLLY repeating it to herself like a lesson Crampton Crampton
Crampton Crampton Crampton She sits down studiously at the
writingtable I must get that name right or Heaven knows what I shall
call him

GLORIA Phil can you believe such a horrible thing as that about our
fatherwhat mother said just now

PHILIP Oh there are lots of people of that kind Old Chalice used to
thrash his wife and daughters with a cartwhip

DOLLY contemptuously Yes a Portuguese

PHILIP When you come to men who are brutes there is much in common
between the Portuguese and the English variety Doll Trust my knowledge
of human nature He resumes his position on the hearthrug with an
elderly and responsible air

GLORIA with angered remorse I dont think we shall ever play again at
our old game of guessing what our father was to be like Dolly are you
sorry for your fatherthe father with lots of money

DOLLY Oh come What about your fatherthe lonely old man with the
tender aching heart Hes pretty well burst up I think

PHILIP There can be no doubt that the governor is an exploded
superstition Valentine is heard talking to somebody outside the door
But hark he comes

GLORIA nervously Who

DOLLY Chalkstones

PHILIP Sh Attention They put on their best manners Philip adds in
a lower voice to Gloria If hes good enough for the lunch Ill nod to
Dolly and if she nods to you invite him straight away

Valentine comes back with his landlord Mr Fergus Crampton is a man of
about sixty tall hard and stringy with an atrociously obstinate ill
tempered grasping mouth and a querulously dogmatic voice Withal he
is highly nervous and sensitive judging by his thin transparent skin
marked with multitudinous lines and his slender fingers His consequent
capacity for suffering acutely from all the dislike that his temper and
obstinacy can bring upon him is proved by his wistful wounded eyes
by a plaintive note in his voice a painful want of confidence in his
welcome and a constant but indifferently successful effort to correct
his natural incivility of manner and proneness to take offence By his
keen brows and forehead he is clearly a shrewd man and there is no
sign of straitened means or commercial diffidence about him he is
well dressed and would be classed at a guess as a prosperous master
manufacturer in a business inherited from an old family in the
aristocracy of trade His navy blue coat is not of the usual fashionable
pattern It is not exactly a pilots coat but it is cut that way
double breasted and with stout buttons and broad lapels a coat for
a shipyard rather than a counting house He has taken a fancy to
Valentine who cares nothing for his crossness of grain and treats
him with a sort of disrespectful humanity for which he is secretly
grateful

VALENTINE May I introducethis is Mr CramptonMiss Dorothy Clandon
Mr Philip Clandon Miss Clandon Crampton stands nervously bowing
They all bow Sit down Mr Crampton

DOLLY pointing to the operating chair That is the most comfortable
chair Mr Chcrampton

CRAMPTON Thank you but wont this young ladyindicating Gloria who
is close to the chair

GLORIA Thank you Mr Crampton we are just going

VALENTINE bustling him across to the chair with goodhumored
peremptoriness Sit down sit down Youre tired

CRAMPTON Well perhaps as I am considerably the oldest person present
I He finishes the sentence by sitting down a little rheumatically in
the operating chair Meanwhile Philip having studied him critically
during his passage across the room nods to Dolly and Dolly nods to
Gloria

GLORIA Mr Crampton we understand that we are preventing Mr Valentine
from lunching with you by taking him away ourselves My mother would be
very glad indeed if you would come too

CRAMPTON gratefully after looking at her earnestly for a moment
Thank you I will come with pleasure

GLORIA  politely  Thank you very mucher

DOLLY  murmuring So glader

PHILIP   Delighted Im sureer

The conversation drops Gloria and Dolly look at one another then at
Valentine and Philip Valentine and Philip unequal to the occasion
look away from them at one another and are instantly so disconcerted by
catching one anothers eye that they look back again and catch the eyes
of Gloria and Dolly Thus catching one another all round they all look
at nothing and are quite at a loss Crampton looks about him waiting
for them to begin The silence becomes unbearable

DOLLY suddenly to keep things going How old are you Mr Crampton

GLORIA hastily I am afraid we must be going Mr Valentine It is
understood then that we meet at half past one She makes for the
door Philip goes with her Valentine retreats to the bell

VALENTINE Half past one He rings the bell Many thanks He follows
Gloria and Philip to the door and goes out with them

DOLLY who has meanwhile stolen across to Crampton Make him give you
gas Its five shillings extra but its worth it

CRAMPTON amused Very well Looking more earnestly at her So you
want to know my age do you Im fiftyseven

DOLLY with conviction You look it

CRAMPTON grimly I dare say I do

DOLLY What are you looking at me so hard for Anything wrong She
feels whether her hat is right

CRAMPTON Youre like somebody

DOLLY Who

CRAMPTON Well you have a curious look of my mother

DOLLY incredulously Your mother Quite sure you dont mean your
daughter

CRAMPTON suddenly blackening with hate Yes Im quite sure I dont
mean my daughter

DOLLY sympathetically Tooth bad

CRAMPTON No no nothing A twinge of memory Miss Clandon not of
toothache

DOLLY Have it out Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow with gas
five shillings extra

CRAMPTON vindictively No not a sorrow An injury that was done me
once thats all I dont forget injuries and I dont want to forget
them His features settle into an implacable frown

reenter Philip to look for Dolly He comes down behind her
unobserved

DOLLY looking critically at Cramptons expression I dont think we
shall like you when you are brooding over your sorrows

PHILIP who has entered the room unobserved and stolen behind her
My sister means well Mr Crampton but she is indiscreet Now Dolly
outside He takes her towards the door

DOLLY in a perfectly audible undertone He says hes only fiftyseven
and he thinks me the image of his mother and he hates his daughter
and She is interrupted by the return of Valentine

VALENTINE Miss Clandon has gone on

PHILIP Dont forget half past one

DOLLY Mind you leave Mr Crampton with enough teeth to eat with They
go out Valentine comes down to his cabinet and opens it

CRAMPTON Thats a spoiled child Mr Valentine Thats one of your
modern products When I was her age I had many a good hiding fresh in
my memory to teach me manners

VALENTINE taking up his dental mirror and probe from the shelf in front
of the cabinet What did you think of her sister

CRAMPTON You liked her better eh

VALENTINE rhapsodically She struck me as being He checks himself
and adds prosaically However thats not business He places himself
behind Cramptons right shoulder and assumes his professional tone
Open please Crampton opens his mouth Valentine puts the mirror in
and examines his teeth Hm You have broken that one What a pity to
spoil such a splendid set of teeth Why do you crack nuts with them He
withdraws the mirror and comes forward to converse with Crampton

CRAMPTON Ive always cracked nuts with them what else are they for
Dogmatically The proper way to keep teeth good is to give them plenty
of use on bones and nuts and wash them every day with soap plain
yellow soap

VALENTINE Soap Why soap

CRAMPTON I began using it as a boy because I was made to and Ive used
it ever since And I never had toothache in my life

VALENTINE Dont you find it rather nasty

CRAMPTON I found that most things that were good for me were nasty But
I was taught to put up with them and made to put up with them Im used
to it now in fact I like the taste when the soap is really good

VALENTINE making a wry face in spite of himself You seem to have been
very carefully educated Mr Crampton

CRAMPTON grimly I wasnt spoiled at all events

VALENTINE smiling a little to himself Are you quite sure

CRAMPTON What dy mean

VALENTINE Well your teeth are good I admit But Ive seen just as
good in very selfindulgent mouths He goes to the ledge of cabinet and
changes the probe for another one

CRAMPTON Its not the effect on the teeth its the effect on the
character

VALENTINE placably Oh the character I see He recommences
operations A little wider please Hm That one will have to come out
its past saving He withdraws the probe and again comes to the side of
the chair to converse Dont be alarmed you shant feel anything Ill
give you gas

CRAMPTON Rubbish man I want none of your gas Out with it People
were taught to bear necessary pain in my day

VALENTINE Oh if you like being hurt all right Ill hurt you as much
as you like without any extra charge for the beneficial effect on your
character

CRAMPTON rising and glaring at him Young man you owe me six weeks
rent

VALENTINE I do

CRAMPTON Can you pay me

VALENTINE No

CRAMPTON satisfied with his advantage I thought not How soon dy
think youll be able to pay me if you have no better manners than to
make game of your patients He sits down again

VALENTINE My good sir my patients havent all formed their characters
on kitchen soap

CRAMPTON suddenly gripping him by the arm as he turns away again to the
cabinet So much the worse for them I tell you you dont understand my
character If I could spare all my teeth Id make you pull them all
out one after another to shew you what a properly hardened man can go
through with when hes made up his mind to do it He nods at him to
enforce the effect of this declaration and releases him

VALENTINE his careless pleasantry quite unruffled And you want to be
more hardened do you

CRAMPTON Yes

VALENTINE strolling away to the bell Well youre quite hard enough
for me alreadyas a landlord Crampton receives this with a growl of
grim humor Valentine rings the bell and remarks in a cheerful casual
way whilst waiting for it to be answered Why did you never get
married Mr Crampton A wife and children would have taken some of the
hardness out of you

CRAMPTON with unexpected ferocity What the devil is that to you The
parlor maid appears at the door

VALENTINE politely Some warm water please She retires and
Valentine comes back to the cabinet not at all put out by Cramptons
rudeness and carries on the conversation whilst he selects a forceps
and places it ready to his hand with a gag and a drinking glass You
were asking me what the devil that was to me Well I have an idea of
getting married myself

CRAMPTON with grumbling irony Naturally sir naturally When a young
man has come to his last farthing and is within twentyfour hours of
having his furniture distrained upon by his landlord he marries Ive
noticed that before Well marry and be miserable

VALENTINE Oh come what do you know about it

CRAMPTON Im not a bachelor

VALENTINE Then there is a Mrs Crampton

CRAMPTON wincing with a pang of resentment Yesdamn her

VALENTINE unperturbed Hm A father too perhaps as well as a
husband Mr Crampton

CRAMPTON Three children

VALENTINE politely Damn themeh

CRAMPTON jealously No sir the children are as much mine as hers
The parlor maid brings in a jug of hot water

VALENTINE Thank you He takes the jug from her and brings it to the
cabinet continuing in the same idle strain I really should like to
know your family Mr Crampton The parlor maid goes out and he pours
some hot water into the drinking glass

CRAMPTON Sorry I cant introduce you sir Im happy to say that I
dont know where they are and dont care so long as they keep out of
my way Valentine with a hitch of his eyebrows and shoulders drops
the forceps with a clink into the glass of hot water You neednt warm
that thing to use on me Im not afraid of the cold steel Valentine
stoops to arrange the gas pump and cylinder beside the chair Whats
that heavy thing

VALENTINE Oh never mind Something to put my foot on to get the
necessary purchase for a good pull Crampton looks alarmed in spite of
himself Valentine stands upright and places the glass with the forceps
in it ready to his hand chatting on with provoking indifference And
so you advise me not to get married Mr Crampton He stoops to fit the
handle on the apparatus by which the chair is raised and lowered

CRAMPTON irritably I advise you to get my tooth out and have done
reminding me of my wife Come along man He grips the arms of the
chair and braces himself

VALENTINE pausing with his hand on the lever to look up at him and
say What do you bet that I dont get that tooth out without your
feeling it

CRAMPTON Your six weeks rent young man Dont you gammon me

VALENTINE jumping at the bet and winding him aloft vigorously Done
Are you ready Crampton who has lost his grip of the chair in his
alarm at its sudden ascent folds his arms sits stiffly upright and
prepares for the worst Valentine lets down the back of the chair to an
obtuse angle

CRAMPTON clutching at the arms of the chair as he falls back Take
care man Im quite helpless in this po

VALENTINE deftly stopping him with the gag and snatching up the
mouthpiece of the gas machine Youll be more helpless presently He
presses the mouthpiece over Cramptons mouth and nose leaning over
his chest so as to hold his head and shoulders well down on the chair
Crampton makes an inarticulate sound in the mouthpiece and tries to
lay hands on Valentine whom he supposes to be in front of him After
a moment his arms wave aimlessly then subside and drop He is quite
insensible Valentine with an exclamation of somewhat preoccupied
triumph throws aside the mouthpiece quickly picks up the forceps
adroitly from the glass andthe curtain falls

END OF ACT I




ACT II


On the terrace at the Marine Hotel It is a square flagged platform
with a parapet of heavy oil jar pilasters supporting a broad stone
coping on the outer edge which stands up over the sea like a cliff
The head waiter of the establishment busy laying napkins on a luncheon
table with his back to the sea has the hotel on his right and on his
left in the corner nearest the sea the flight of steps leading down to
the beach

When he looks down the terrace in front of him he sees a little to his
left a solitary guest a middleaged gentleman sitting on a chair of
iron laths at a little iron table with a bowl of lump sugar and three
wasps on it reading the Standard with his umbrella up to defend him
from the sun which in August and at less than an hour after noon is
toasting his protended insteps Just opposite him at the hotel side of
the terrace there is a garden seat of the ordinary esplanade pattern
Access to the hotel for visitors is by an entrance in the middle of
its facade reached by a couple of steps on a broad square of raised
pavement Nearer the parapet there lurks a way to the kitchen masked by
a little trellis porch The table at which the waiter is occupied is a
long one set across the terrace with covers and chairs for five two at
each side and one at the end next the hotel Against the parapet another
table is prepared as a buffet to serve from

The waiter is a remarkable person in his way A silky old man
whitehaired and delicate looking but so cheerful and contented that
in his encouraging presence ambition stands rebuked as vulgarity and
imagination as treason to the abounding sufficiency and interest of
the actual He has a certain expression peculiar to men who have been
extraordinarily successful in their calling and who whilst aware of
the vanity of success are untouched by envy

The gentleman at the iron table is not dressed for the seaside He wears
his London frock coat and gloves and his tall silk hat is on the table
beside the sugar bowl The excellent condition and quality of these
garments the goldrimmed folding spectacles through which he is reading
the Standard and the Times at his elbow overlaying the local paper
all testify to his respectability He is about fifty clean shaven and
closecropped with the corners of his mouth turned down purposely as
if he suspected them of wanting to turn up and was determined not to
let them have their way He has large expansive ears cod colored eyes
and a brow kept resolutely wide open as if again he had resolved in
his youth to be truthful magnanimous and incorruptible but had never
succeeded in making that habit of mind automatic and unconscious Still
he is by no means to be laughed at There is no sign of stupidity or
infirmity of will about him on the contrary he would pass anywhere
at sight as a man of more than average professional capacity and
responsibility Just at present he is enjoying the weather and the sea
too much to be out of patience but he has exhausted all the news in his
papers and is at present reduced to the advertisements which are not
sufficiently succulent to induce him to persevere with them


THE GENTLEMAN yawning and giving up the paper as a bad job Waiter

WAITER Sir coming down C

THE GENTLEMAN Are you quite sure Mrs Clandon is coming back before
lunch

WAITER Quite sure sir She expects you at a quarter to one sir The
gentleman soothed at once by the waiters voice looks at him with a
lazy smile It is a quiet voice with a gentle melody in it that gives
sympathetic interest to his most commonplace remark and he speaks with
the sweetest propriety neither dropping his aitches nor misplacing
them nor committing any other vulgarism He looks at his watch as he
continues Not that yet sir is it 1243 sir Only two minutes more
to wait sir Nice morning sir

THE GENTLEMAN Yes very fresh after London

WAITER Yes sir so all our visitors say sir Very nice family Mrs
Clandons sir

THE GENTLEMAN You like them do you

WAITER Yes sir They have a free way with them that is very taking
sir very taking indeed sir especially the young lady and gentleman

THE GENTLEMAN Miss Dorothea and Mr Philip I suppose

WAITER Yes sir The young lady in giving an order or the like
of that will say Remember William we came to this hotel on
your account having heard what a perfect waiter you are The young
gentleman will tell me that I remind him strongly of his father the
gentleman starts at this and that he expects me to act by him as such
Soothing sunny cadence Oh very pleasant sir very affable and
pleasant indeed

THE GENTLEMAN You like his father He laughs at the notion

WAITER Oh we must not take what they say too seriously sir Of
course sir if it were true the young lady would have seen the
resemblance too sir

THE GENTLEMAN Did she

WAITER No sir She thought me like the bust of Shakespear in Stratford
Church sir That is why she calls me William sir My real name is
Walter sir He turns to go back to the table and sees Mrs Clandon
coming up to the terrace from the beach by the steps Here is Mrs
Clandon sir To Mrs Clandon in an unobtrusively confidential tone
Gentleman for you maam

MRS CLANDON We shall have two more gentlemen at lunch William

WAITER Right maam Thank you maam He withdraws into the hotel
Mrs Clandon comes forward looking round for her visitor but passes
over the gentleman without any sign of recognition

THE GENTLEMAN peering at her quaintly from under the umbrella Dont
you know me

MRS CLANDON incredulously looking hard at him Are you Finch McComas

McCOMAS Cant you guess He shuts the umbrella puts it aside and
jocularly plants himself with his hands on his hips to be inspected

MRS CLANDON I believe you are She gives him her hand The shake that
ensues is that of old friends after a long separation Wheres your
beard

McCOMAS with humorous solemnity Would you employ a solicitor with a
beard

MRS CLANDON pointing to the silk hat on the table Is that your hat

McCOMAS Would you employ a solicitor with a sombrero

MRS CLANDON I have thought of you all these eighteen years with the
beard and the sombrero She sits down on the garden seat McComas takes
his chair again Do you go to the meetings of the Dialectical Society
still

McCOMAS gravely I do not frequent meetings now

MRS CLANDON Finch I see what has happened You have become
respectable

McCOMAS Havent you

MRS CLANDON Not a bit

McCOMAS You hold to your old opinions still

MRS CLANDON As firmly as ever

McCOMAS Bless me And you are still ready to make speeches in public
in spite of your sex Mrs Clandon nods to insist on a married
womans right to her own separate property she nods again to champion
Darwins view of the origin of species and John Stuart Mills essay on
Liberty nod to read Huxley Tyndall and George Eliot three nods
and to demand University degrees the opening of the professions and
the parliamentary franchise for women as well as men

MRS CLANDON resolutely Yes I have not gone back one inch and I
have educated Gloria to take up my work where I left it That is what
has brought me back to England I felt that I had no right to bury her
alive in Madeiramy St Helena Finch I suppose she will be howled at
as I was but she is prepared for that

McCOMAS Howled at My dear good lady there is nothing in any of those
views nowadays to prevent her from marrying a bishop You reproached
me just now for having become respectable You were wrong I hold to
our old opinions as strongly as ever I dont go to church and I dont
pretend I do I call myself what I am a Philosophic Radical standing
for liberty and the rights of the individual as I learnt to do from
my master Herbert Spencer Am I howled at No Im indulged as an old
fogey Im out of everything because Ive refused to bow the knee to
Socialism

MRS CLANDON shocked Socialism

McCOMAS Yes Socialism Thats what Miss Gloria will be up to her ears
in before the end of the month if you let her loose here

MRS CLANDON emphatically But I can prove to her that Socialism is a
fallacy

McCOMAS touchingly It is by proving that Mrs Clandon that I have
lost all my young disciples Be careful what you do let her go her own
way With some bitterness Were oldfashioned the world thinks it
has left us behind There is only one place in all England where your
opinions would still pass as advanced

MRS CLANDON scornfully unconvinced The Church perhaps

McCOMAS No the theatre And now to business Why have you made me come
down here

MRS CLANDON Well partly because I wanted to see you

McCOMAS with goodhumored irony Thanks

MRS CLANDON and partly because I want you to explain everything
to the children They know nothing and now that we have come back
to England it is impossible to leave them in ignorance any longer
Agitated Finch I cannot bring myself to tell them I She is
interrupted by the twins and Gloria Dolly comes tearing up the steps
racing Philip who combines a terrific speed with unhurried propriety of
bearing which however costs him the race as Dolly reaches her mother
first and almost upsets the garden seat by the precipitancy of her
arrival

DOLLY breathless Its all right mamma The dentist is coming and
hes bringing his old man

MRS CLANDON Dolly dear dont you see Mr McComas Mr McComas
rises smilingly

DOLLY her face falling with the most disparagingly obvious
disappointment This Where are the flowing locks

PHILIP seconding her warmly Where the beardthe cloakthe poetic
exterior

DOLLY Oh Mr McComas youve gone and spoiled yourself Why didnt you
wait till wed seen you

McCOMAS taken aback but rallying his humor to meet the emergency
Because eighteen years is too long for a solicitor to go without having
his hair cut

GLORIA at the other side of McComas How do you do Mr McComas He
turns and she takes his hand and presses it with a frank straight look
into his eyes We are glad to meet you at last

McCOMAS Miss Gloria I presume Gloria smiles assent and releases his
hand after a final pressure She then retires behind the garden seat
leaning over the back beside Mrs Clandon And this young gentleman

PHILIP I was christened in a comparatively prosaic mood My name is

DOLLY completing his sentence for him declamatorily Norval On the
Grampian hills

PHILIP declaiming gravely My father feeds his flock a frugal
swain

MRS CLANDON remonstrating Dear dear children dont be silly
Everything is so new to them here Finch that they are in the wildest
spirits They think every Englishman they meet is a joke

DOLLY Well so he is its not our fault

PHILIP My knowledge of human nature is fairly extensive Mr McComas
but I find it impossible to take the inhabitants of this island
seriously

McCOMAS I presume sir you are Master Philip offering his hand

PHILIP taking McComass hand and looking solemnly at him I was Master
Philipwas so for many years just as you were once Master Finch He
gives his hand a single shake and drops it then turns away exclaiming
meditatively How strange it is to look back on our boyhood McComas
stares after him not at all pleased

DOLLY to Mrs Clandon Has Finch had a drink

MRS CLANDON remonstrating Dearest Mr McComas will lunch with us

DOLLY Have you ordered for seven Dont forget the old gentleman

MRS CLANDON I have not forgotten him dear What is his name

DOLLY Chalkstones Hell be here at half past one To McComas Are we
like what you expected

MRS CLANDON changing her tone to a more earnest one Dolly Mr
McComas has something more serious than that to tell you Children I
have asked my old friend to answer the question you asked this morning
He is your fathers friend as well as mine and he will tell you the
story more fairly than I could Turning her head from them to Gloria
Gloria are you satisfied

GLORIA gravely attentive Mr McComas is very kind

McCOMAS nervously Not at all my dear young lady not at all At the
same time this is rather sudden I was hardly prepareder

DOLLY suspiciously Oh we dont want anything prepared

PHILIP exhorting him Tell us the truth

DOLLY emphatically Bald headed

McCOMAS nettled I hope you intend to take what I have to say
seriously

PHILIP with profound mock gravity I hope it will deserve it Mr
McComas My knowledge of human nature teaches me not to expect too much

MRS CLANDON remonstrating Phil

PHILIP Yes mother all right I beg your pardon Mr McComas dont
mind us

DOLLY in conciliation We mean well

PHILIP Shut up both

Dolly holds her lips McComas takes a chair from the luncheon table
places it between the little table and the garden seat with Dolly on his
right and Philip on his left and settles himself in it with the air
of a man about to begin a long communication The Clandons match him
expectantly

McCOMAS Ahem Your father

DOLLY interrupting How old is he

PHILIP Sh

MRS CLANDON softly Dear Dolly dont let us interrupt Mr McComas

McCOMAS emphatically Thank you Mrs Clandon Thank you To Dolly
Your father is fiftyseven

DOLLY with a bound startled and excited Fiftyseven Where does he
live

MRS CLANDON remonstrating Dolly Dolly

McCOMAS stopping her Let me answer that Mrs Clandon The answer
will surprise you considerably He lives in this town Mrs
Clandon rises She and Gloria look at one another in the greatest
consternation

DOLLY with conviction I knew it Phil Chalkstones is our father

McCOMAS Chalkstones

DOLLY Oh Crampstones or whatever it is He said I was like his
mother I knew he must mean his daughter

PHILIP very seriously Mr McComas I desire to consider your feelings
in every possible way but I warn you that if you stretch the long arm
of coincidence to the length of telling me that Mr Crampton of this
town is my father I shall decline to entertain the information for a
moment

McCOMAS And pray why

PHILIP Because I have seen the gentleman and he is entirely unfit
to be my father or Dollys father or Glorias father or my mothers
husband

McCOMAS Oh indeed Well sir let me tell you that whether you like it
or not he is your father and your sister father and Mrs Clandons
husband Now What have you to say to that

DOLLY whimpering You neednt be so cross Crampton isnt your father

PHILIP Mr McComas your conduct is heartless Here you find a family
enjoying the unspeakable peace and freedom of being orphans We have
never seen the face of a relativenever known a claim except the claim
of freely chosen friendship And now you wish to thrust into the most
intimate relationship with us a man whom we dont know

DOLLY vehemently An awful old man reproachfully And you began as
if you had quite a nice father for us

McCOMAS angrily How do you know that he is not nice And what right
have you to choose your own father raising his voice Let me tell
you Miss Clandon that you are too young to

DOLLY interrupting him suddenly and eagerly Stop I forgot Has he
any money

McCOMAS He has a great deal of money

DOLLY delighted Oh what did I always say Phil

PHILIP Dolly we have perhaps been condemning the old man too hastily
Proceed Mr McComas

McCOMAS I shall not proceed sir I am too hurt too shocked to
proceed

MRS CLANDON urgently Finch do you realize what is happening Do you
understand that my children have invited that man to lunch and that he
will be here in a few moments

McCOMAS completely upset What do you meanam I to understandis
it

PHILIP impressively Steady Finch Think it out slowly and carefully
Hes comingcoming to lunch

GLORIA Which of us is to tell him the truth Have you thought of that

MRS CLANDON Finch you must tell him

DOLLY Oh Finch is no good at telling things Look at the mess he has
made of telling us

McCOMAS I have not been allowed to speak I protest against this

DOLLY taking his arm coaxingly Dear Finch dont be cross

MRS CLANDON Gloria let us go in He may arrive at any moment

GLORIA proudly Do not stir mother I shall not stir We must not run
away

MRS CLANDON delicately rebuking her My dear we cannot sit down to
lunch just as we are We shall come back again We must have no bravado
Gloria winces and goes into the hotel without a word Come Dolly
As she goes into the hotel door the waiter comes out with plates
etc for two additional covers on a tray

WAITER Gentlemen come yet maam

MRS CLANDON Two more to come yet thank you They will be here
immediately She goes into the hotel The waiter takes his tray to the
service table

PHILIP I have an idea Mr McComas this communication should be made
should it not by a man of infinite tact

McCOMAS It will require tact certainly

PHILIP Good Dolly whose tact were you noticing only this morning

DOLLY seizing the idea with rapture Oh yes I declare William

PHILIP The very man Calling William

WAITER Coming sir

McCOMAS horrified The waiter Stop stop I will not permit this I

WAITER presenting himself between Philip and McComas Yes sir
McComass complexion fades into stone grey and all movement and
expression desert his eyes He sits down stupefied

PHILIP William you remember my request to you to regard me as your
son

WAITER with respectful indulgence Yes sir Anything you please sir

PHILIP William at the very outset of your career as my father a rival
has appeared on the scene

WAITER Your real father sir Well that was to be expected sooner or
later sir wasnt it Turning with a happy smile to McComas Is it
you sir

McCOMAS renerved by indignation Certainly not My children know how
to behave themselves

PHILIP No William this gentleman was very nearly my father he wooed
my mother but wooed her in vain

McCOMAS outraged Well of all the

PHILIP Sh Consequently he is only our solicitor Do you know one
Crampton of this town

WAITER Cockeyed Crampton sir of the Crooked Billet is it

PHILIP I dont know Finch does he keep a public house

McCOMAS rising scandalized No no no Your father sir is a
wellknown yacht builder an eminent man here

WAITER impressed Oh beg pardon sir Im sure A son of Mr
Cramptons Dear me

PHILIP Mr Crampton is coming to lunch with us

WAITER puzzled Yes sir Diplomatically Dont usually lunch with
his family perhaps sir

PHILIP impressively William he does not know that we are his family
He has not seen us for eighteen years He wont know us To emphasize
the communication he seats himself on the iron table with a spring and
looks at the waiter with his lips compressed and his legs swinging

DOLLY We want you to break the news to him William

WAITER But I should think hed guess when he sees your mother miss
Philips legs become motionless at this elucidation He contemplates
the waiter raptly

DOLLY dazzled I never thought of that

PHILIP Nor I Coming off the table and turning reproachfully on
McComas Nor you

DOLLY And you a solicitor

PHILIP Finch Your professional incompetence is appalling William
your sagacity puts us all to shame

DOLLY You really are like Shakespear William

WAITER Not at all sir Dont mention it miss Most happy Im
sure sir Goes back modestly to the luncheon table and lays the two
additional covers one at the end next the steps and the other so as to
make a third on the side furthest from the balustrade

PHILIP abruptly Finch come and wash your hands Seizes his arm and
leads him toward the hotel

McCOMAS I am thoroughly vexed and hurt Mr Clandon

PHILIP interrupting him You will get used to us Come Dolly
McComas shakes him off and marches into the hotel Philip follows with
unruffled composure

DOLLY turning for a moment on the steps as she follows them Keep your
wits about you William There will be fireworks

WAITER Right miss You may depend on me miss She goes into the
hotel

Valentine comes lightly up the steps from the beach followed doggedly
by Crampton Valentine carries a walking stick Crampton either
because he is old and chilly or with some idea of extenuating the
unfashionableness of his reefer jacket wears a light overcoat He stops
at the chair left by McComas in the middle of the terrace and steadies
himself for a moment by placing his hand on the back of it

CRAMPTON Those steps make me giddy He passes his hand over his
forehead I have not got over that infernal gas yet

He goes to the iron chair so that he can lean his elbows on the little
table to prop his head as he sits He soon recovers and begins to
unbutton his overcoat Meanwhile Valentine interviews the waiter

VALENTINE Waiter

WAITER coming forward between them Yes sir

VALENTINE Mrs Lanfrey Clandon

WAITER with a sweet smile of welcome Yes sir Were expecting you
sir That is your table sir Mrs Clandon will be down presently sir
The young lady and young gentleman were just talking about your friend
sir

VALENTINE Indeed

WAITER smoothly melodious Yes sire Great flow of spirits sir A
vein of pleasantry as you might say sir Quickly to Crampton who
has risen to get the overcoat off Beg pardon sir but if youll allow
me helping him to get the overcoat off and taking it from him Thank
you sir Crampton sits down again and the waiter resumes the broken
melody The young gentlemans latest is that youre his father sir

CRAMPTON What

WAITER Only his joke sir his favourite joke Yesterday I was to be
his father Today as soon as he knew you were coming sir he tried to
put it up on me that you were his father his long lost fathernot seen
you for eighteen years he said

CRAMPTON startled Eighteen years

WAITER Yes sir With gentle archness But I was up to his tricks
sir I saw the idea coming into his head as he stood there thinking
what new joke hed have with me Yes sir thats the sort he is very
pleasant very off hand and affable indeed sir Again changing his
tempo to say to Valentine who is putting his stick down against the
corner of the garden seat If youll allow me sir Taking Valentines
stick Thank you sir Valentine strolls up to the luncheon table and
looks at the menu The waiter turns to Crampton and resumes his lay
Even the solicitor took up the joke although he was in a manner of
speaking in my confidence about the young gentleman sir Yes sir I
assure you sir You would never imagine what respectable professional
gentlemen from London will do on an outing when the sea air takes them
sir

CRAMPTON Oh theres a solicitor with them is there

WAITER The family solicitor siryes sir Name of McComas sir He
goes towards hotel entrance with coat and stick happily unconscious of
the bomblike effect the name has produced on Crampton

CRAMPTON rising in angry alarm McComas Calls to Valentine
Valentine Again fiercely Valentine Valentine turns This is a
plant a conspiracy This is my familymy childrenmy infernal wife

VALENTINE coolly On indeed Interesting meeting He resumes his
study of the menu

CRAMPTON Meeting Not for me Let me out of this Calling to the
waiter Give me that coat

WAITER Yes sir He comes back puts Valentines stick carefully down
against the luncheon table and delicately shakes the coat out and holds
it for Crampton to put on I seem to have done the young gentleman an
injustice sir havent I sir

CRAMPTON Rrrh He stops on the point of putting his arms into the
sleeves and turns to Valentine with sudden suspicion Valentine you
are in this You made this plot You

VALENTINE decisively Bosh He throws the menu down and goes round
the table to look out unconcernedly over the parapet

CRAMPTON angrily What dye McComas followed by Philip and Dolly
comes out He vacillates for a moment on seeing Crampton

WAITER softlyinterrupting Crampton Steady sir Here they come
sir He takes up the stick and makes for the hotel throwing the coat
across his arm McComas turns the corners of his mouth resolutely down
and crosses to Crampton who draws back and glares with his hands
behind him McComas with his brow opener than ever confronts him in
the majesty of a spotless conscience

WAITER aside as he passes Philip on his way out Ive broke it to
him sir

PHILIP Invaluable William He passes on to the table

DOLLY aside to the waiter How did he take it

WAITER aside to her Startled at first miss but resignedvery
resigned indeed miss He takes the stick and coat into the hotel

McCOMAS having stared Crampton out of countenance So here you are
Mr Crampton

CRAMPTON Yes herecaught in a trapa mean trap Are those my
children

PHILIP with deadly politeness Is this our father Mr McComas

McCOMAS Yeser He loses countenance himself and stops

DOLLY conventionally Pleased to meet you again She wanders
idly round the table exchanging a smile and a word of greeting with
Valentine on the way

PHILIP Allow me to discharge my first duty as host by ordering your
wine He takes the wine list from the table His polite attention and
Dollys unconcerned indifference leave Crampton on the footing of
the casual acquaintance picked up that morning at the dentists The
consciousness of it goes through the father with so keen a pang that
he trembles all over his brow becomes wet and he stares dumbly at
his son who just conscious enough of his own callousness to intensely
enjoy the humor and adroitness of it proceeds pleasantly Finch some
crusted old port for you as a respectable family solicitor eh

McCOMAS firmly Apollinaris only I prefer to take nothing heating
He walks away to the side of the terrace like a man putting temptation
behind him

PHILIP Valentine

VALENTINE Would Lager be considered vulgar

PHILIP Probably Well order some Dolly takes it Turning to Crampton
with cheerful politeness And now Mr Crampton what can we do for
you

CRAMPTON What dye mean boy

PHILIP Boy Very solemnly Whose fault is it that I am a boy

Crampton snatches the wine list rudely from him and irresolutely
pretends to read it Philip abandons it to him with perfect politeness

DOLLY looking over Cramptons right shoulder The whiskys on the last
page but one

CRAMPTON Let me alone child

DOLLY Child No no you may call me Dolly if you like but you mustnt
call me child She slips her arm through Philips and the two stand
looking at Crampton as if he were some eccentric stranger

CRAMPTON mopping his brow in rage and agony and yet relieved even by
their playing with him McComas we arehagoing to have a pleasant
meal

McCOMAS pusillanimously There is no reason why it should not be
pleasant He looks abjectly gloomy

PHILIP Finchs face is a feast in itself Mrs Clandon and Gloria come
from the hotel Mrs Clandon advances with courageous selfpossession
and marked dignity of manner She stops at the foot of the steps to
address Valentine who is in her path Gloria also stops looking at
Crampton with a certain repulsion

MRS CLANDON Glad to see you again Mr Valentine He smiles She
passes on and confronts Crampton intending to address him with perfect
composure but his aspect shakes her She stops suddenly and says
anxiously with a touch of remorse Fergus you are greatly changed

CRAMPTON grimly I daresay A man does change in eighteen years

MRS CLANDON troubled II did not mean that I hope your health is
good

CRAMPTON Thank you No its not my health Its my happiness thats
the change you meant I think Breaking out suddenly Look at her
McComas Look at her and look at me He utters a half laugh half
sob

PHILIP Sh Pointing to the hotel entrance where the waiter has just
appeared Order before William

DOLLY touching Cramptons arm warningly with her finger Ahem The
waiter goes to the service table and beckons to the kitchen entrance
whence issue a young waiter with soup plates and a cook in white apron
and cap with the soup tureen The young waiter remains and serves the
cook goes out and reappears from time to time bringing in the courses
He carves but does not serve The waiter comes to the end of the
luncheon table next the steps

MRS CLANDON as they all assemble about the table I think you have
all met one another already today Oh no excuse me Introducing Mr
Valentine Mr McComas She goes to the end of the table nearest the
hotel Fergus will you take the head of the table please

CRAMPTON Ha Bitterly The head of the table

WAITER holding the chair for him with inoffensive encouragement This

MRS CLANDON Mr Valentine will you take that side indicating the
side nearest the parapet with Gloria Valentine and Gloria take their
places Gloria next Crampton and Valentine next Mrs Clandon Finch

yourself as best you can The three take the remaining side of the
table Dolly next her mother Phil next his father and McComas between

WAITER to Crampton Thick or clear sir

CRAMPTON to Mrs Clandon Does nobody ask a blessing in this
household

PHILIP interposing smartly Let us first settle what we are about to

WAITER Yes sir He glides swiftly round the table to Phils left
elbow On his way he whispers to the young waiter Thick

PHILIP Two small Lagers for the children as usual William and one
large for this gentleman indicating Valentine Large Apollinaris for

WAITER striking in mellifluously All right sir We know what Mr
Crampton likes here sir He goes into the hotel

PHILIP looking gravely at his father You frequent bars Bad habit
The cook accompanied by a waiter with a supply of hot plates brings
in the fish from the kitchen to the service table and begins slicing
it

CRAMPTON You have learnt your lesson from your mother I see

MRS CLANDON Phil will you please remember that your jokes are apt to
irritate people who are not accustomed to us and that your father is
our guest today

CRAMPTON bitterly Yes a guest at the head of my own table The soup
plates are removed

DOLLY sympathetically Yes its embarrassing isnt it Its just as
bad for us you know

Mr McComas

McCOMAS disconcerted No no I only said after all to round off the
sentence Iererer

WAITER tactfully Turbot sir

smart waiter

WAITER Cant be learnt sir Its in the character sir

for the lady sir yes sir He serves bread to Gloria and resumes at
his former pitch Very few are born to it sir

PHILIP You dont happen to have such a thing as a son yourself have

GLORIA No thank you The fish plates are removed

DOLLY Is your son a waiter too William

softened by time No sir the other baryour profession sir A QC

McCOMAS embarrassed Im sure I beg your pardon

WAITER Not at all sir Very natural mistake Im sure sir Ive often
wished he was a potman sir Would have been off my hands ever so much

Scholarships sir Cambridge Local sir Sidney Sussex College sir
Dolly plucks his sleeve and whispers as he bends down Stone ginger
miss Right miss To McComas Very good thing for him sir he never
had any turn for real work sir He goes into the hotel leaving the
company somewhat overwhelmed by his sons eminence

VALENTINE Which of us dare give that man an order again

DOLLY I hope he wont mind my sending him for gingerbeer

CRAMPTON doggedly While hes a waiter its his business to wait If
you had treated him as a waiter ought to be treated hed have held his
tongue

DOLLY What a loss that would have been Perhaps hell give us an
introduction to his son and get us into London society The waiter
reappears with the gingerbeer

CRAMPTON growling contemptuously London society London society
Youre not fit for any society child

DOLLY losing her temper Now look here Mr Crampton If you think

WAITER softly at her elbow Stone ginger miss

DOLLY taken aback recovers her good humor after a long breath and says
sweetly Thank you dear William You were just in time She drinks

McCOMAS making a fresh effort to lead the conversation into
dispassionate regions If I may be allowed to change the subject Miss
Clandon what is the established religion in Madeira

GLORIA I suppose the Portuguese religion I never inquired

DOLLY The servants come in Lent and kneel down before you and confess
all the things theyve done and you have to pretend to forgive them Do
they do that in England William

WAITER Not usually miss They may in some parts but it has not come
under my notice miss Catching Mrs Clandons eye as the young waiter
offers her the salad bowl You like it without dressing maam yes
maam I have some for you To his young colleague motioning him to
serve Gloria This side Jo He takes a special portion of salad from
the service table and puts it beside Mrs Clandons plate In doing so
he observes that Dolly is making a wry face Only a bit of watercress
miss got in by mistake He takes her salad away Thank you miss
To the young waiter admonishing him to serve Dolly afresh Jo
Resuming Mostly members of the Church of England miss

DOLLY Members of the Church of England Whats the subscription

CRAMPTON rising violently amid general consternation You see how my
children have been brought up McComas You see it you hear it I call
all of you to witness He becomes inarticulate and is about to strike
his fist recklessly on the table when the waiter considerately takes
away his plate

MRS CLANDON firmly Sit down Fergus There is no occasion at all
for this outburst You must remember that Dolly is just like a foreigner
here Pray sit down

CRAMPTON subsiding unwillingly I doubt whether I ought to sit here
and countenance all this I doubt it

WAITER Cheese sir or would you like a cold sweet

CRAMPTON take aback What Ohcheese cheese

DOLLY Bring a box of cigarettes William

WAITER All ready miss He takes a box of cigarettes from the service
table and places them before Dolly who selects one and prepares to
smoke He then returns to his table for a box of vestas

CRAMPTON staring aghast at Dolly Does she smoke

DOLLY out of patience Really Mr Crampton Im afraid Im spoiling
your lunch Ill go and have my cigarette on the beach She leaves
the table with petulant suddenness and goes down the steps The waiter
attempts to give her the matches but she is gone before he can reach
her

CRAMPTON furiously Margaret call that girl back Call her back I
say

McCOMAS trying to make peace Come Crampton never mind Shes her
fathers daughter thats all

MRS CLANDON with deep resentment I hope not Finch She rises they
all rise a little Mr Valentine will you excuse me I am afraid Dolly
is hurt and put out by what has passed I must go to her

CRAMPTON To take her part against me you mean

MRS CLANDON ignoring him Gloria will you take my place whilst I am
away dear She crosses to the steps Cramptons eyes follow her with
bitter hatred The rest watch her in embarrassed silence feeling the
incident to be a very painful one

WAITER intercepting her at the top of the steps and offering her a box
of vestas Young lady forgot the matches maam If you would be so
good maam

MRS CLANDON surprised into grateful politeness by the witchery of his
sweet and cheerful tones Thank you very much She takes the matches
and goes down to the beach The waiter shepherds his assistant along
with him into the hotel by the kitchen entrance leaving the luncheon
party to themselves

CRAMPTON throwing himself back in his chair Theres a mother for you
McComas Theres a mother for you

GLORIA steadfastly Yes a good mother

CRAMPTON And a bad father Thats what you mean eh

VALENTINE rising indignantly and addressing Gloria Miss Clandon I

CRAMPTON turning on him That girls name is Crampton Mr Valentine
not Clandon Do you wish to join them in insulting me

VALENTINE ignoring him Im overwhelmed Miss Clandon Its all my
fault I brought him here Im responsible for him And Im ashamed of
him

CRAMPTON What dy mean

GLORIA rising coldly No harm has been done Mr Valentine We have
all been a little childish I am afraid Our party has been a failure
let us break it up and have done with it She puts her chair aside
and turns to the steps adding with slighting composure as she passes
Crampton Goodbye father

She descends the steps with cold disgusted indifference They all look
after her and so do not notice the return of the waiter from the hotel
laden with Cramptons coat Valentines stick a couple of shawls and
parasols a white canvas umbrella and some camp stools

CRAMPTON to himself staring after Gloria with a ghastly expression
Father Father He strikes his fist violently on the table Now

WAITER offering the coat This is yours sir I think sir Crampton
glares at him then snatches it rudely and comes down the terrace
towards the garden seat struggling with the coat in his angry efforts
to put it on McComas rises and goes to his assistance then takes
his hat and umbrella from the little iron table and turns towards the
steps Meanwhile the waiter after thanking Crampton with unruffled
sweetness for taking the coat offers some of his burden to Phil The
ladies sunshades sir Nasty glare off the sea today sir very trying
to the complexion sir I shall carry down the camp stools myself sir

PHILIP You are old Father William but you are the most considerate of
men No keep the sunshades and give me the camp stools taking them

WAITER with flattering gratitude Thank you sir

PHILIP Finch share with me giving him a couple Come along They go
down the steps together

VALENTINE to the waiter Leave me something to bring downone of
these Offering to take a sunshade

WAITER discreetly Thats the younger ladys sir Valentine lets
it go Thank you sir If youll allow me sir I think you had better
have this He puts down the sunshades on Cramptons chair and
produces from the tail pocket of his dress coat a book with a ladys
handkerchief between the leaves marking the page The eldest young
lady is reading it at present Valentine takes it eagerly Thank you
sir Schopenhauer sir you see He takes up the sunshades again Very
interesting author sir especially on the subject of ladies sir He
goes down the steps Valentine about to follow him recollects Crampton
and changes his mind

VALENTINE coming rather excitedly to Crampton Now look here
Crampton are you at all ashamed of yourself

CRAMPTON pugnaciously Ashamed of myself What for

VALENTINE For behaving like a bear What will your daughter think of me
for having brought you here

CRAMPTON I was not thinking of what my daughter was thinking of you

VALENTINE No you were thinking of yourself Youre a perfect maniac

CRAMPTON heartrent She told you what I ama fathera father robbed
of his children What are the hearts of this generation like Am I to
come here after all these yearsto see what my children are for
the first time to hear their voicesand carry it all off like a
fashionable visitor drop in to lunch be Mr CramptonM i s t e
r Crampton What right have they to talk to me like that Im their
father do they deny that Im a man with the feelings of our common
humanity have I no rights no claims In all these years who have I
had round me Servants clerks business acquaintances Ive had respect
from themaye kindness Would one of them have spoken to me as that
girl spokewould one of them have laughed at me as that boy was
laughing at me all the time Frantically My own children M i s t e r
Crampton My

VALENTINE Come come theyre only children The only one of them
thats worth anything called you father

CRAMPTON wildly Yes goodbye father Oh yes she got at my
feelingswith a stab

VALENTINE taking this in very bad part Now look here Crampton you
just let her alone shes treated you very well I had a much worse time
of it at lunch than you

CRAMPTON You

VALENTINE with growing impetuosity Yes I I sat next to her and
I never said a single thing to her the whole timecouldnt think of a
blessed word And not a word did she say to me

CRAMPTON Well

VALENTINE Well Well Tackling him very seriously and talking
faster and faster Crampton do you know whats been the matter with me
today You dont suppose do you that Im in the habit of playing such
tricks on my patients as I played on you

CRAMPTON I hope not

VALENTINE The explanation is that Im stark mad or rather that Ive
never been in my real senses before Im capable of anything Ive grown
up at last Im a Man and its your daughter thats made a man of me

CRAMPTON incredulously Are you in love with my daughter

VALENTINE his words now coming in a perfect torrent Love Nonsense
its something far above and beyond that Its life its faith its
strength certainty paradise

CRAMPTON interrupting him with acrid contempt Rubbish man What have
you to keep a wife on You cant marry her

VALENTINE Who wants to marry her Ill kiss her hands Ill kneel at
her feet Ill live for her Ill die for her and thatll be enough for
me Look at her book See He kisses the handkerchief If you offered
me all your money for this excuse for going down to the beach and
speaking to her again Id only laugh at you He rushes buoyantly off
to the steps where he bounces right into the arms of the waiter who
is coming up form the beach The two save themselves from falling by
clutching one another tightly round the waist and whirling one another
around

WAITER delicately Steady sir steady

VALENTINE shocked at his own violence I beg your pardon

WAITER Not at all sir not at all Very natural sir Im sure sir
at your age The lady has sent me for her book sir Might I take the
liberty of asking you to let her have it at once sir

VALENTINE With pleasure And if you will allow me to present you with a
professional mans earnings for six weeks offering him Dollys crown
piece

WAITER as if the sum were beyond his utmost expectations Thank you
sir much obliged Valentine dashes down the steps Very highspirited
young gentleman sir very manly and straight set up

CRAMPTON in grumbling disparagement And making his fortune in a
hurry no doubt I know what his six weeks earnings come to He
crosses the terrace to the iron table and sits down

WAITER philosophically Well sir you never can tell Thats a
principle in life with me sir if youll excuse my having such a thing
sir Delicately sinking the philosopher in the waiter for a moment
Perhaps you havent noticed that you hadnt touched that seltzer and
Irish sir when the party broke up He takes the tumbler from the
luncheon table and sets if before Crampton Yes sir you never can
tell There was my son sir who ever thought that he would rise to wear
a silk gown sir And yet today sir nothing less than fifty guineas
sir What a lesson sir

CRAMPTON Well I hope he is grateful to you and recognizes what he
owes you

WAITER We get on together very well very well indeed sir considering
the difference in our stations With another of his irresistible
transitions A small lump of sugar sir will take the flatness out of
the seltzer without noticeably sweetening the drink sir Allow me
sir He drops a lump of sugar into the tumbler But as I say to him
wheres the difference after all If I must put on a dress coat to show
what I am sir he must put on a wig and gown to show what he is If
my income is mostly tips and theres a pretence that I dont get them
why his income is mostly fees sir and I understand theres a pretence
that he dont get them If he likes society and his profession brings
him into contact with all ranks so does mine too sir If its a
little against a barrister to have a waiter for his father sir its
a little against a waiter to have a barrister for a son many people
consider it a great liberty sir I assure you sir Can I get you
anything else sir

CRAMPTON No thank you With bitter humility I suppose thats no
objection to my sitting here for a while I cant disturb the party on
the beach here

WAITER with emotion Very kind of you sir to put it as if it was not
a compliment and an honour to us Mr Crampton very kind indeed The
more you are at home here sir the better for us

CRAMPTON in poignant irony Home

WAITER reflectively Well yes sir thats a way of looking at it
too sir I have always said that the great advantage of a hotel is that
its a refuge from home life sir

CRAMPTON I missed that advantage today I think

WAITER You did sir you did Dear me Its the unexpected that always
happens isnt it Shaking his head You never can tell sir you
never can tell He goes into the hotel

CRAMPTON his eyes shining hardly as he props his drawn miserable face
on his hands Home Home He drops his arms on the table and bows his
head on them but presently hears someone approaching and hastily sits
bolt upright It is Gloria who has come up the steps alone with her
sunshade and her book in her hands He looks defiantly at her with
the brutal obstinacy of his mouth and the wistfulness of his eyes
contradicting each other pathetically She comes to the corner of the
garden seat and stands with her back to it leaning against the end of
it and looking down at him as if wondering at his weakness too curious
about him to be cold but supremely indifferent to their kinship Well

GLORIA I want to speak with you for a moment

CRAMPTON looking steadily at her Indeed Thats surprising You meet
your father after eighteen years and you actually want to speak to
him for a moment Thats touching isnt it He rests his head on his
hands and looks down and away from her in gloomy reflection

GLORIA All that is what seems to me so nonsensical so uncalled for
What do you expect us to feel for youto do for you What is it you
want Why are you less civil to us than other people are You are
evidently not very fond of uswhy should you be But surely we can meet
without quarrelling

CRAMPTON a dreadful grey shade passing over his face Do you realize
that I am your father

GLORIA Perfectly

CRAMPTON Do you know what is due to me as your father

GLORIA For instance

CRAMPTON rising as if to combat a monster For instance For
instance For instance duty affection respect obedience

GLORIA quitting her careless leaning attitude and confronting him
promptly and proudly I obey nothing but my sense of what is right
I respect nothing that is not noble That is my duty She adds less
firmly As to affection it is not within my control I am not sure
that I quite know what affection means She turns away with an evident
distaste for that part of the subject and goes to the luncheon table
for a comfortable chair putting down her book and sunshade

CRAMPTON following her with his eyes Do you really mean what you are
saying

GLORIA turning on him quickly and severely Excuse me that is an
uncivil question I am speaking seriously to you and I expect you to
take me seriously She takes one of the luncheon chairs turns it away
from the table and sits down a little wearily saying Can you not
discuss this matter coolly and rationally

CRAMPTON Coolly and rationally No I cant Do you understand that I
cant

GLORIA emphatically No That I c a n n o t understand I have no
sympathy with

CRAMPTON shrinking nervously Stop Dont say anything more yet you
dont know what youre doing Do you want to drive me mad She frowns
finding such petulance intolerable He adds hastily No Im not angry
indeed Im not Wait wait give me a little time to think He
stands for a moment screwing and clinching his brows and hands in his
perplexity then takes the end chair from the luncheon table and
sits down beside her saying with a touching effort to be gentle and
patient Now I think I have it At least Ill try

GLORIA firmly You see Everything comes right if we only think it
resolutely out

CRAMPTON in sudden dread No dont think I want you to feel thats
the only thing that can help us Listen Do youbut firstI forgot
Whats your name I mean you pet name They cant very well call you
Sophronia

GLORIA with astonished disgust Sophronia My name is Gloria I am
always called by it

CRAMPTON his temper rising again Your name is Sophronia girl you
were called after your aunt Sophronia my sister she gave you your
first Bible with your name written in it

GLORIA Then my mother gave me a new name

CRAMPTON angrily She had no right to do it I will not allow this

GLORIA You had no right to give me your sisters name I dont know
her

CRAMPTON Youre talking nonsense There are bounds to what I will put
up with I will not have it Do you hear that

GLORIA rising warningly Are you resolved to quarrel

CRAMPTON terrified pleading No no sit down Sit down wont you
She looks at him keeping him in suspense He forces himself to utter
the obnoxious name Gloria She marks her satisfaction with a slight
tightening of the lips and sits down There You see I only want to
shew you that I am your father mymy dear child The endearment is
so plaintively inept that she smiles in spite of herself and resigns
herself to indulge him a little Listen now What I want to ask you is
this Dont you remember me at all You were only a tiny child when you
were taken away from me but you took plenty of notice of things Cant
you remember someone whom you loved or shyly at least liked in a
childish way Come someone who let you stay in his study and look at
his toy boats as you thought them He looks anxiously into her face
for some response and continues less hopefully and more urgently
Someone who let you do as you liked there and never said a word to you
except to tell you that you must sit still and not speak Someone who
was something that no one else was to youwho was your father

GLORIA unmoved If you describe things to me no doubt I shall
presently imagine that I remember them But I really remember nothing

CRAMPTON wistfully Has your mother never told you anything about me

GLORIA She has never mentioned your name to me He groans
involuntarily She looks at him rather contemptuously and continues
Except once and then she did remind me of something I had forgotten

CRAMPTON looking up hopefully What was that

GLORIA mercilessly The whip you bought to beat me with

CRAMPTON gnashing his teeth Oh To bring that up against me To turn
from me When you need never have known Under a grinding agonized
breath Curse her

GLORIA springing up You wretch With intense emphasis You wretch
You dare curse my mother

CRAMPTON Stop or youll be sorry afterwards Im your father

GLORIA How I hate the name How I love the name of mother You had
better go

CRAMPTON IIm choking You want to kill me SomeI His voice
stifles he is almost in a fit

GLORIA going up to the balustrade with cool quick resourcefulness and
calling over to the beach Mr Valentine

VALENTINE answering from below Yes

GLORIA Come here a moment please Mr Crampton wants you She returns
to the table and pours out a glass of water

CRAMPTON recovering his speech No let me alone I dont want him
Im all right I tell you I need neither his help nor yours He rises
and pulls himself together As you say I had better go He puts on
his hat Is that your last word

GLORIA I hope so He looks stubbornly at her for a moment nods
grimly as if he agreed to that and goes into the hotel She looks at
him with equal steadiness until he disappears when she makes a gesture
of relief and turns to speak to Valentine who comes running up the
steps

VALENTINE panting Whats the matter Looking round Wheres
Crampton

GLORIA Gone Valentines face lights up with sudden joy dread
and mischief He has just realized that he is alone with Gloria She
continues indifferently I thought he was ill but he recovered himself
He wouldnt wait for you I am sorry She goes for her book and
parasol

VALENTINE So much the better He gets on my nerves after a while
Pretending to forget himself How could that man have so beautiful a
daughter

GLORIA taken aback for a moment then answering him with polite but
intentional contempt That seems to be an attempt at what is called a
pretty speech Let me say at once Mr Valentine that pretty speeches
make very sickly conversation Pray let us be friends if we are to be
friends in a sensible and wholesome way I have no intention of getting
married and unless you are content to accept that state of things we
had much better not cultivate each others acquaintance

VALENTINE cautiously I see May I ask just this one question Is
your objection an objection to marriage as an institution or merely an
objection to marrying me personally

GLORIA I do not know you well enough Mr Valentine to have any
opinion on the subject of your personal merits She turns away from him
with infinite indifference and sits down with her book on the garden
seat I do not think the conditions of marriage at present are such as
any selfrespecting woman can accept

VALENTINE instantly changing his tone for one of cordial sincerity as
if he frankly accepted her terms and was delighted and reassured by her
principles Oh then thats a point of sympathy between us already I
quite agree with you the conditions are most unfair He takes off his
hat and throws it gaily on the iron table No what I want is to get
rid of all that nonsense He sits down beside her so naturally that
she does not think of objecting and proceeds with enthusiasm Dont
you think it a horrible thing that a man and a woman can hardly know one
another without being supposed to have designs of that kind As if there
were no other interestsno other subjects of conversationas if women
were capable of nothing better

GLORIA interested Ah now you are beginning to talk humanly and
sensibly Mr Valentine

VALENTINE with a gleam in his eye at the success of his hunters
guile Of coursetwo intelligent people like us Isnt it pleasant
in this stupid conventionridden world to meet with someone on the
same planesomeone with an unprejudiced enlightened mind

GLORIA earnestly I hope to meet many such people in England

VALENTINE dubiously Hm There are a good many people here nearly
forty millions Theyre not all consumptive members of the highly
educated classes like the people in Madeira

GLORIA now full of her subject Oh everybody is stupid and prejudiced
in Madeiraweak sentimental creatures I hate weakness and I hate
sentiment

VALENTINE Thats what makes you so inspiring

GLORIA with a slight laugh Am I inspiring

VALENTINE Yes Strengths infectious

GLORIA Weakness is I know

VALENTINE with conviction Y o ure strong Do you know that you
changed the world for me this morning I was in the dumps thinking of
my unpaid rent frightened about the future When you came in I was
dazzled Her brow clouds a little He goes on quickly That was silly
of course but really and truly something happened to me Explain it
how you will my blood got he hesitates trying to think of a
sufficiently unimpassioned word oxygenated my muscles braced my
mind cleared my courage rose Thats odd isnt it considering that I
am not at all a sentimental man

GLORIA uneasily rising Let us go back to the beach

VALENTINE darklylooking up at her What you feel it too

GLORIA Feel what

VALENTINE Dread

GLORIA Dread

VALENTINE As if something were going to happen It came over me
suddenly just before you proposed that we should run away to the others

GLORIA amazed Thats strangevery strange I had the same
presentiment

VALENTINE How extraordinary Rising Well shall we run away

GLORIA Run away Oh no that would be childish She sits down
again He resumes his seat beside her and watches her with a gravely
sympathetic air She is thoughtful and a little troubled as she adds I
wonder what is the scientific explanation of those fancies that cross us
occasionally

VALENTINE Ah I wonder Its a curiously helpless sensation isnt it

GLORIA rebelling against the word Helpless

VALENTINE Yes As if Nature after allowing us to belong to ourselves
and do what we judged right and reasonable for all these years were
suddenly lifting her great hand to take usher two little childrenby
the scruffs of our little necks and use us in spite of ourselves for
her own purposes in her own way

GLORIA Isnt that rather fanciful

VALENTINE with a new and startling transition to a tone of utter
recklessness I dont know I dont care Bursting out reproachfully
Oh Miss Clandon Miss Clandon how could you

GLORIA What have I done

VALENTINE Thrown this enchantment on me Im honestly trying to be
sensiblescientificeverything that you wish me to be Butbut oh
dont you see what you have set to work in my imagination

GLORIA with indignant scornful sternness I hope you are not going to
be so foolishso vulgaras to say love

VALENTINE with ironical haste to disclaim such a weakness No no no
Not love we know better than that Lets call it chemistry You cant
deny that there is such a thing as chemical action chemical affinity
chemical combinationthe most irresistible of all natural forces Well
youre attracting me irresistiblychemically

GLORIA contemptuously Nonsense

VALENTINE Of course its nonsense you stupid girl Gloria recoils
in outraged surprise Yes stupid girl t h a ts a scientific fact
anyhow Youre a priga feminine prig thats what you are Rising
Now I suppose youve done with me for ever He goes to the iron table
and takes up his hat

GLORIA with elaborate calm sitting up like a Highschoolmistress
posing to be photographed That shows how very little you understand my
real character I am not in the least offended He pauses and puts his
hat down again I am always willing to be told of my own defects Mr
Valentine by my friends even when they are as absurdly mistaken about
me as you are I have many faultsvery serious faultsof character and
temper but if there is one thing that I am not it is what you call a
prig She closes her lips trimly and looks steadily and challengingly
at him as she sits more collectedly than ever

VALENTINE returning to the end of the garden seat to confront her more
emphatically Oh yes you are My reason tells me so my knowledge
tells me so my experience tells me so

GLORIA Excuse my reminding you that your reason and your knowledge and
your experience are not infallible At least I hope not

VALENTINE I must believe them Unless you wish me to believe my eyes
my heart my instincts my imagination which are all telling me the
most monstrous lies about you

GLORIA the collectedness beginning to relax Lies

VALENTINE obstinately Yes lies He sits down again beside her Do
you expect me to believe that you are the most beautiful woman in the
world

GLORIA That is ridiculous and rather personal

VALENTINE Of course its ridiculous Well thats what my eyes tell
me Gloria makes a movement of contemptuous protest No Im not
flattering I tell you I dont believe it She is ashamed to find that
this does not quite please her either Do you think that if you were
to turn away in disgust from my weakness I should sit down here and cry
like a child

GLORIA beginning to find that she must speak shortly and pointedly to
keep her voice steady Why should you pray

VALENTINE with a stir of feeling beginning to agitate his voice
Of course not Im not such an idiot And yet my heart tells me I
shouldmy fool of a heart But Ill argue with my heart and bring it to
reason If I loved you a thousand times Ill force myself to look the
truth steadily in the face After all its easy to be sensible the
facts are the facts Whats this place its not heaven its the Marine
Hotel Whats the time its not eternity its about half past one in
the afternoon What am I a dentista five shilling dentist

GLORIA And I am a feminine prig

VALENTINE passionately No no I cant face that I must have one
illusion leftthe illusion about you I love you He turns towards her
as if the impulse to touch her were ungovernable she rises and stands
on her guard wrathfully He springs up impatiently and retreats a step
Oh what a fool I aman idiot You dont understand I might as well
talk to the stones on the beach He turns away discouraged

GLORIA reassured by his withdrawal and a little remorseful I am
sorry I do not mean to be unsympathetic Mr Valentine but what can I
say

VALENTINE returning to her with all his recklessness of manner replaced
by an engaging and chivalrous respect You can say nothing Miss
Clandon I beg your pardon it was my own fault or rather my own bad
luck You see it all depended on your naturally liking me She is
about to speak he stops her deprecatingly Oh I know you mustnt tell
me whether you like me or not but

GLORIA her principles up in arms at once Must not Why not I am a
free woman why should I not tell you

VALENTINE pleading in terror and retreating Dont Im afraid to
hear

GLORIA no longer scornful You need not be afraid I think you are
sentimental and a little foolish but I like you

VALENTINE dropping into the iron chair as if crushed Then its all
over He becomes the picture of despair

GLORIA puzzled approaching him But why

VALENTINE Because liking is not enough Now that I think down into it
seriously I dont know whether I like you or not

GLORIA looking down at him with wondering concern Im sorry

VALENTINE in an agony of restrained passion Oh dont pity me Your
voice is tearing my heart to pieces Let me alone Gloria You go down
into the very depths of me troubling and stirring meI cant struggle
with itI cant tell you

GLORIA breaking down suddenly Oh stop telling me what you feel I
cant bear it

VALENTINE springing up triumphantly the agonized voice now solid
ringing and jubilant Ah its come at lastmy moment of courage He
seizes her hands she looks at him in terror Our moment of courage
He draws her to him kisses her with impetuous strength and laughs
boyishly Now youve done it Gloria Its all over were in love with
one another She can only gasp at him But what a dragon you were And
how hideously afraid I was

PHILIPS VOICE calling from the beach Valentine

DOLLYS VOICE Mr Valentine

VALENTINE Goodbye Forgive me He rapidly kisses her hands and runs
away to the steps where he meets Mrs Clandon ascending Gloria quite
lost can only start after him

MRS CLANDON The children want you Mr Valentine She looks anxiously
around Is he gone

VALENTINE puzzled He Recollecting Oh Crampton Gone this long
time Mrs Clandon He runs off buoyantly down the steps

GLORIA sinking upon the seat Mother

MRS CLANDON hurrying to her in alarm What is it dear

GLORIA with heartfelt appealing reproach Why didnt you educate me
properly

MRS CLANDON amazed My child I did my best

GLORIA Oh you taught me nothingnothing

MRS CLANDON What is the matter with you

GLORIA with the most intense expression Only shameshame shame
Blushing unendurably she covers her face with her hands and turns away
from her mother

ACT III


The Clandons sitting room in the hotel An expensive apartment on the
ground floor with a French window leading to the gardens In the centre
of the room is a substantial table surrounded by chairs and draped
with a maroon cloth on which opulently bound hotel and railway guides
are displayed A visitor entering through the window and coming down to
this central table would have the fireplace on his left and a writing
table against the wall on his right next the door which is further
down He would if his taste lay that way admire the wall decoration
of Lincrusta Walton in plum color and bronze lacquer with dado and
cornice the ormolu consoles in the corners the vases on pillar
pedestals of veined marble with bases of polished black wood one on
each side of the window the ornamental cabinet next the vase on the
side nearest the fireplace its centre compartment closed by an inlaid
door and its corners rounded off with curved panes of glass protecting
shelves of cheap blue and white pottery the bamboo tea table with
folding shelves in the corresponding space on the other side of
the window the pictures of ocean steamers and Landseers dogs the
saddlebag ottoman in line with the door but on the other side of the
room the two comfortable seats of the same pattern on the hearthrug
and finally on turning round and looking up the massive brass
pole above the window sustaining a pair of maroon rep curtains with
decorated borders of staid green Altogether a room well arranged
to flatter the occupants sense of importance and reconcile him to a
charge of a pound a day for its use

Mrs Clandon sits at the writing table correcting proofs Gloria is
standing at the window looking out in a tormented revery

The clock on the mantelpiece strikes five with a sickly clink the bell
being unable to bear up against the black marble cenotaph in which it is
immured

MRS CLANDON Five I dont think we need wait any longer for the
children The are sure to get tea somewhere

GLORIA wearily Shall I ring

MRS CLANDON Do my dear Gloria goes to the hearth and rings I have
finished these proofs at last thank goodness

GLORIA strolling listlessly across the room and coming behind her
mothers chair What proofs

MRS CLANDON The new edition of Twentieth Century Women

GLORIA with a bitter smile Theres a chapter missing

MRS CLANDON beginning to hunt among her proofs Is there Surely not

GLORIA I mean an unwritten one Perhaps I shall write it for youwhen
I know the end of it She goes back to the window

MRS CLANDON Gloria More enigmas

GLORIA Oh no The same enigma

MRS CLANDON puzzled and rather troubled after watching her for a
moment My dear

GLORIA returning Yes

MRS CLANDON You know I never ask questions

GLORIA kneeling beside her chair I know I know She suddenly throws
her arms about her mother and embraces her almost passionately

MRS CLANDON gently smiling but embarrassed My dear you are
getting quite sentimental

GLORIA recoiling Ah no no Oh dont say that Oh She rises and
turns away with a gesture as if tearing herself

MRS CLANDON mildly My dear what is the matter What The waiter
enters with the tea tray

WAITER balmily This was what you rang for maam I hope

MRS CLANDON Thank you yes She turns her chair away from the writing
table and sits down again Gloria crosses to the hearth and sits
crouching there with her face averted

WAITER placing the tray temporarily on the centre table I thought so
maam Curious how the nerves seem to give out in the afternoon without
a cup of tea He fetches the tea table and places it in front of Mrs
Cladon conversing meanwhile the young lady and gentleman have just
come back maam they have been out in a boat maam Very pleasant on
a fine afternoon like thisvery pleasant and invigorating indeed He
takes the tray from the centre table and puts it on the tea table
Mr McComas will not come to tea maam he has gone to call upon Mr
Crampton He takes a couple of chairs and sets one at each end of the
tea table

GLORIA looking round with an impulse of terror And the other
gentleman

WAITER reassuringly as he unconsciously drops for a moment into
the measure of Ive been roaming which he sang as a boy Oh hes
coming miss hes coming He has been rowing the boat miss and has
just run down the road to the chemists for something to put on the
blisters But he will be here directly missdirectly Gloria in
ungovernable apprehension rises and hurries towards the door

MRS CLANDON half rising Glo Gloria goes out Mrs Clandon looks
perplexedly at the waiter whose composure is unruffled

WAITER cheerfully Anything more maam

MRS CLANDON Nothing thank you

WAITER Thank you maam As he withdraws Phil and Dolly in the
highest spirits come tearing in He holds the door open for them then
goes out and closes it

DOLLY ravenously Oh give me some tea Mrs Clandon pours out a cup
for her Weve been out in a boat Valentine will be here presently

PHILIP He is unaccustomed to navigation Wheres Gloria

MRS CLANDON anxiously as she pours out his tea Phil there is
something the matter with Gloria Has anything happened Phil and Dolly
look at one another and stifle a laugh What is it

PHILIP sitting down on her left Romeo

DOLLY sitting down on her right and Juliet

PHILIP taking his cup of tea from Mrs Clandon Yes my dear mother
the old old story Dolly dont take all the milk He deftly takes the
jug from her Yes in the spring

DOLLY a young mans fancy

PHILIP lightly turns tothank you to Mrs Clandon who has passed
the biscuits thoughts of love It also occurs in the autumn The
young man in this case is

DOLLY Valentine

PHILIP And his fancy has turned to Gloria to the extent of

DOLLY kissing her

PHILIP on the terrace

DOLLY correcting him on the lips before everybody

MRS CLANDON incredulously Phil Dolly Are you joking They shake
their heads Did she allow it

PHILIP We waited to see him struck to earth by the lightning of her
scorn

DOLLY but he wasnt

PHILIP She appeared to like it

DOLLY As far as we could judge Stopping Phil who is about to pour
out another cup No youve sworn off two cups

MRS CLANDON much troubled Children you must not be here when Mr
Valentine comes I must speak very seriously to him about this

PHILIP To ask him his intentions What a violation of Twentieth Century
principles

DOLLY Quite right mamma bring him to book Make the most of the
nineteenth century while it lasts

PHILIP Sh Here he is Valentine comes in

VALENTINE Very sorry to be late for tea Mrs Clandon She takes up the
teapot No thank you I never take any No doubt Miss Dolly and Phil
have explained what happened to me

PHILIP momentously rising Yes Valentine we have explained

DOLLY significantly also rising We have explained very thoroughly

PHILIP It was our duty Very seriously Come Dolly He offers Dolly
his arm which she takes They look sadly at him and go out gravely
arm in arm Valentine stares after them puzzled then looks at Mrs
Clandon for an explanation

MRS CLANDON rising and leaving the tea table Will you sit down
Mr Valentine I want to speak to you a little if you will allow me
Valentine sits down slowly on the ottoman his conscience presaging
a bad quarter of an hour Mrs Clandon takes Phils chair and seats
herself deliberately at a convenient distance from him I must begin by
throwing myself somewhat at your consideration I am going to speak of a
subject of which I know very littleperhaps nothing I mean love

VALENTINE Love

MRS CLANDON Yes love Oh you need not look so alarmed as that Mr
Valentine I am not in love with you

VALENTINE overwhelmed Oh really Mrs Recovering himself I
should be only too proud if you were

MRS CLANDON Thank you Mr Valentine But I am too old to begin

VALENTINE Begin Have you never

MRS CLANDON Never My case is a very common one Mr Valentine I
married before I was old enough to know what I was doing As you have
seen for yourself the result was a bitter disappointment for both my
husband and myself So you see though I am a married woman I have
never been in love I have never had a love affair and to be quite
frank with you Mr Valentine what I have seen of the love affairs of
other people has not led me to regret that deficiency in my experience
Valentine looking very glum glances sceptically at her and says
nothing Her color rises a little and she adds with restrained anger
You do not believe me

VALENTINE confused at having his thought read Oh why not Why not

MRS CLANDON Let me tell you Mr Valentine that a life devoted to
the Cause of Humanity has enthusiasms and passions to offer which far
transcend the selfish personal infatuations and sentimentalities
of romance Those are not your enthusiasms and passions I take it
Valentine quite aware that she despises him for it answers in the
negative with a melancholy shake of the head I thought not Well I am
equally at a disadvantage in discussing those socalled affairs of the
heart in which you appear to be an expert

VALENTINE restlessly What are you driving at Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON I think you know

VALENTINE Gloria

MRS CLANDON Yes Gloria

VALENTINE surrendering Well yes Im in love with Gloria
Interposing as she is about to speak I know what youre going to say
Ive no money

MRS CLANDON I care very little about money Mr Valentine

VALENTINE Then youre very different to all the other mothers who have
interviewed me

MRS CLANDON Ah now we are coming to it Mr Valentine You are an old
hand at this He opens his mouth to protest she cuts him short with
some indignation Oh do you think little as I understand these
matters that I have not common sense enough to know that a man
who could make as much way in one interview with such a woman as my
daughter can hardly be a novice

VALENTINE I assure you

MRS CLANDON stopping him I am not blaming you Mr Valentine It is
Glorias business to take care of herself and you have a right to amuse
yourself as you please But

VALENTINE protesting Amuse myself Oh Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON relentlessly On your honor Mr Valentine are you in
earnest

VALENTINE desperately On my honor I am in earnest She looks
searchingly at him His sense of humor gets the better of him and he
adds quaintly Only I always have been in earnest and yethere I am
you see

MRS CLANDON This is just what I suspected Severely Mr Valentine
you are one of those men who play with womens affections

VALENTINE Well why not if the Cause of Humanity is the only thing
worth being serious about However I understand Rising and taking his
hat with formal politeness You wish me to discontinue my visits

MRS CLANDON No I am sensible enough to be well aware that Glorias
best chance of escape from you now is to become better acquainted with
you

VALENTINE unaffectedly alarmed Oh dont say that Mrs Clandon You
dont think that do you

MRS CLANDON I have great faith Mr Valentine in the sound training
Glorias mind has had since she was a child

VALENTINE amazingly relieved Ooh Oh thats all right He sits
down again and throws his hat flippantly aside with the air of a man who
has no longer anything to fear

MRS CLANDON indignant at his assurance What do you mean

VALENTINE turning confidentially to her Come shall I teach you
something Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON stiffly I am always willing to learn

VALENTINE Have you ever studied the subject of
gunneryartillerycannons and warships and so on

MRS CLANDON Has gunnery anything to do with Gloria

VALENTINE A great dealby way of illustration During this whole
century my dear Mrs Clandon the progress of artillery has been a duel
between the maker of cannons and the maker of armor plates to keep the
cannon balls out You build a ship proof against the best gun known
somebody makes a better gun and sinks your ship You build a heavier
ship proof against that gun somebody makes a heavier gun and sinks you
again And so on Well the duel of sex is just like that

MRS CLANDON The duel of sex

VALENTINE Yes youve heard of the duel of sex havent you Oh I
forgot youve been in Madeira the expression has come up since your
time Need I explain it

MRS CLANDON contemptuously No

VALENTINE Of course not Now what happens in the duel of sex The old
fashioned mother received an old fashioned education to protect her
against the wiles of man Well you know the result the old fashioned
man got round her The old fashioned woman resolved to protect her
daughter more effectuallyto find some armor too strong for the old
fashioned man So she gave her daughter a scientific educationyour
plan That was a corker for the old fashioned man he said it wasnt
fairunwomanly and all the rest of it But that didnt do him any good
So he had to give up his old fashioned plan of attackyou knowgoing
down on his knees and swearing to love honor and obey and so on

MRS CLANDON Excuse me that was what the woman swore

VALENTINE Was it Ah perhaps youre rightyes of course it was
Well what did the man do Just what the artillery man does went one
better than the womaneducated himself scientifically and beat her at
that game just as he had beaten her at the old game I learnt how to
circumvent the Womens Rights woman before I was twenty three its all
been found out long ago You see my methods are thoroughly modern

MRS CLANDON with quiet disgust No doubt

VALENTINE But for that very reason theres one sort of girl against
whom they are of no use

MRS CLANDON Pray which sort

VALENTINE The thoroughly old fashioned girl If you had brought up
Gloria in the old way it would have taken me eighteen months to get
to the point I got to this afternoon in eighteen minutes Yes Mrs
Clandon the Higher Education of Women delivered Gloria into my hands
and it was you who taught her to believe in the Higher Education of
Women

MRS CLANDON rising Mr Valentine you are very clever

VALENTINE rising also Oh Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON And you have taught me n o t h i n g Goodbye

VALENTINE horrified Goodbye Oh maynt I see her before I go

MRS CLANDON I am afraid she will not return until you have gone Mr
Valentine She left the room expressly to avoid you

VALENTINE thoughtfully Thats a good sign Goodbye He bows and
makes for the door apparently well satisfied

MRS CLANDON alarmed Why do you think it a good sign

VALENTINE turning near the door Because I am mortally afraid of her
and it looks as if she were mortally afraid of me He turns to go and
finds himself face to face with Gloria who has just entered She looks
steadfastly at him He stares helplessly at her then round at Mrs
Clandon then at Gloria again completely at a loss

GLORIA white and controlling herself with difficulty Mother is what
Dolly told me true

MRS CLANDON What did she tell you dear

GLORIA That you have been speaking about me to this gentleman

VALENTINE murmuring This gentleman Oh

MRS CLANDON sharply Mr Valentine can you hold your tongue for a
moment He looks piteously at them then with a despairing shrug goes
back to the ottoman and throws his hat on it

GLORIA confronting her mother with deep reproach Mother what right
had you to do it

MRS CLANDON I dont think I have said anything I have no right to say
Gloria

VALENTINE confirming her officiously Nothing Nothing whatever
Gloria looks at him with unspeakable indignation I beg your pardon
He sits down ignominiously on the ottoman

GLORIA I cannot believe that any one has any right even to think about
things that concern me only She turns away from them to conceal a
painful struggle with her emotion

MRS CLANDON My dear if I have wounded your pride

GLORIA turning on them for a moment My p r i d e My pride Oh its
gone I have learnt now that I have no strength to be proud of Turning
away again But if a woman cannot protect herself no one can protect
her No one has any right to trynot even her mother I know I have
lost your confidence just as I have lost this mans respect She
stops to master a sob

VALENTINE under his breath This man Murmuring again Oh

MRS CLANDON in an undertone Pray be silent sir

GLORIA continuing but I have at least the right to be left alone in
my disgrace I am one of those weak creatures born to be mastered by the
first man whose eye is caught by them and I must fulfill my destiny
I suppose At least spare me the humiliation of trying to save me She
sits down with her handkerchief to her eyes at the farther end of the
table

VALENTINE jumping up Look here

MRS CLANDON Mr Va

VALENTINE recklessly No I will speak Ive been silent for nearly
thirty seconds He goes up to Gloria Miss Clandon

GLORIA bitterly Oh not Miss Clandon you have found that it is quite
safe to call me Gloria

VALENTINE No I wont youll throw it in my teeth afterwards and
accuse me of disrespect I say its a heartbreaking falsehood that I
dont respect you Its true that I didnt respect your old pride why
should I It was nothing but cowardice I didnt respect your intellect
Ive a better one myself its a masculine specialty But when the
depths stirredwhen my moment camewhen you made me braveah
then then t h e n

GLORIA Then you respected me I suppose

VALENTINE No I didnt I adored you She rises quickly and turns her
back on him And you can never take that moment away from me So now I
dont care what happens He comes down the room addressing a cheerful
explanation to nobody in particular Im perfectly aware that Im
talking nonsense I cant help it To Mrs Clandon I love Gloria and
theres an end of it

MRS CLANDON emphatically Mr Valentine you are a most dangerous
man Gloria come here Gloria wondering a little at the command
obeys and stands with drooping head on her mothers right hand
Valentine being on the opposite side Mrs Clandon then begins with
intense scorn Ask this man whom you have inspired and made brave how
many women have inspired him before Gloria looks up suddenly with a
flash of jealous anger and amazement how many times he has laid the
trap in which he has caught you how often he has baited it with the
same speeches how much practice it has taken to make him perfect in his
chosen part in life as the Duellist of Sex

VALENTINE This isnt fair Youre abusing my confidence Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON Ask him Gloria

GLORIA in a flush of rage going over to him with her fists clenched
Is that true

VALENTINE Dont be angry

GLORIA interrupting him implacably Is it true Did you ever say that
before Did you ever feel that beforefor another woman

VALENTINE bluntly Yes Gloria raises her clenched hands

MRS CLANDON horrified springing to her side and catching her uplifted
arm Gloria My dear Youre forgetting yourself Gloria with a deep
expiration slowly relaxes her threatening attitude

VALENTINE Remember a mans power of love and admiration is like any
other of his powers he has to throw it away many times before he learns
what is really worthy of it

MRS CLANDON Another of the old speeches Gloria Take care

VALENTINE remonstrating Oh

GLORIA to Mrs Clandon with contemptuous selfpossession Do you
think I need to be warned now To Valentine You have tried to make me
love you

VALENTINE I have

GLORIA Well you have succeeded in making me hate you passionately

VALENTINE philosophically Its surprising how little difference
there is between the two Gloria turns indignantly away from him He
continues to Mrs Clandon I know men whose wives love them and they
go on exactly like that

MRS CLANDON Excuse me Mr Valentine but had you not better go

GLORIA You need not send him away on my account mother He is nothing
to me now and he will amuse Dolly and Phil She sits down with
slighting indifference at the end of the table nearest the window

VALENTINE gaily Of course thats the sensible way of looking at it
Come Mrs Clandon you cant quarrel with a mere butterfly like me

MRS CLANDON I very greatly mistrust you Mr Valentine But I do
not like to think that your unfortunate levity of disposition is mere
shamelessness and worthlessness

GLORIA to herself but aloud It is shameless and it is worthless

MRS CLANDON so perhaps we had better send for Phil and Dolly and
allow you to end your visit in the ordinary way

VALENTINE as if she had paid him the highest compliment You overwhelm
me Mrs Clandon Thank you The waiter enters

WAITER Mr McComas maam

MRS CLANDON Oh certainly Bring him in

WAITER He wishes to see you in the receptionroom maam

MRS CLANDON Why not here

WAITER Well if you will excuse my mentioning it maam I think Mr
McComas feels that he would get fairer play if he could speak to you
away from the younger members of your family maam

MRS CLANDON Tell him they are not here

WAITER They are within sight of the door maam and very watchful for
some reason or other

MRS CLANDON going Oh very well Ill go to him

WAITER holding the door open for her Thank you maam She goes out
He comes back into the room and meets the eye of Valentine who wants
him to go All right sir Only the teathings sir Taking the tray
Excuse me sir Thank you sir He goes out

VALENTINE to Gloria Look here You will forgive me sooner or later
Forgive me now

GLORIA rising to level the declaration more intensely at him Never
While grass grows or water runs never never never

VALENTINE unabashed Well I dont care I cant be unhappy about
anything I shall never be unhappy again never never never while
grass grows or water runs The thought of you will always make me wild
with joy Some quick taunt is on her lips he interposes swiftly No
I never said that before thats new

GLORIA It will not be new when you say it to the next woman

VALENTINE Oh dont Gloria dont He kneels at her feet

GLORIA Get up Get up How dare you Phil and Dolly racing as usual
for first place burst into the room They check themselves on seeing
what is passing Valentine springs up

PHILIP discreetly I beg your pardon Come Dolly He turns to go

GLORIA annoyed Mother will be back in a moment Phil Severely
Please wait here for her She turns away to the window where she
stands looking out with her back to them

PHILIP significantly Oh indeed Hmhm

DOLLY Ahah

PHILIP You seem in excellent spirits Valentine

VALENTINE I am Comes between them Now look here You both know
whats going on dont you Gloria turns quickly as if anticipating
some fresh outrage

DOLLY Perfectly

VALENTINE Well its all over Ive been refusedscorned Im only
here on sufferance You understand its all over Your sister is in no
sense entertaining my addresses or condescending to interest herself
in me in any way Gloria satisfied turns back contemptuously to the
window Is that clear

DOLLY Serve you right You were in too great a hurry

PHILIP patting him on the shoulder Never mind youd never have been
able to call your soul your own if shed married you You can now begin
a new chapter in your life

DOLLY Chapter seventeen or thereabouts I should imagine

VALENTINE much put out by this pleasantry No dont say things like
that Thats just the sort of thoughtless remark that makes a lot of
mischief

DOLLY Oh indeed Hmhm

PHILIP Ahah He goes to the hearth and plants himself there in his
best headofthefamily attitude

McComas looking very serious comes in quickly with Mrs Clandon whose
first anxiety is about Gloria She looks round to see where she is and
is going to join her at the window when Gloria comes down to meet her
with a marked air of trust and affection Finally Mrs Clandon takes
her former seat and Gloria posts herself behind it McComas on his way
to the ottoman is hailed by Dolly

DOLLY What cheer Finch

McCOMAS sternly Very serious news from your father Miss Clandon
Very serious news indeed He crosses to the ottoman and sits down
Dolly looking deeply impressed follows him and sits beside him on his
right

VALENTINE Perhaps I had better go

McCOMAS By no means Mr Valentine You are deeply concerned in this
Valentine takes a chair from the table and sits astride of it leaning
over the back near the ottoman Mrs Clandon your husband demands the
custody of his two younger children who are not of age Mrs Clandon
in quick alarm looks instinctively to see if Dolly is safe

DOLLY touched Oh how nice of him He likes us mamma

McCOMAS I am sorry to have to disabuse you of any such idea Miss
Dorothea

DOLLY cooing ecstatically Dorotheeeeeea Nestling against his
shoulder quite overcome Oh Finch

McCOMAS nervously moving away No no no no

MRS CLANDON remonstrating D e a r e s t Dolly To McComas The
deed of separation gives me the custody of the children

McCOMAS It also contains a covenant that you are not to approach or
molest him in any way

MRS CLANDON Well have I done so

McCOMAS Whether the behavior of your younger children amounts to legal
molestation is a question on which it may be necessary to take counsels
opinion At all events Mr Crampton not only claims to have been
molested but he believes that he was brought here by a plot in which
Mr Valentine acted as your agent

VALENTINE Whats that Eh

McCOMAS He alleges that you drugged him Mr Valentine

VALENTINE So I did They are astonished

McCOMAS But what did you do that for

DOLLY Five shillings extra

McCOMAS to Dolly shorttemperedly I must really ask you Miss
Clandon not to interrupt this very serious conversation with irrelevant
interjections Vehemently I insist on having earnest matters
earnestly and reverently discussed This outburst produces an
apologetic silence and puts McComas himself out of countenance He
coughs and starts afresh addressing himself to Gloria Miss Clandon
it is my duty to tell you that your father has also persuaded himself
that Mr Valentine wishes to marry you

VALENTINE interposing adroitly I do

McCOMAS offended In that case sir you must not be surprised to find
yourself regarded by the young ladys father as a fortune hunter

VALENTINE So I am Do you expect my wife to live on what I earn
tenpence a week

McCOMAS revolted I have nothing more to say sir I shall return and
tell Mr Crampton that this family is no place for a father He makes
for the door

MRS CLANDON with quiet authority Finch He halts If Mr Valentine
cannot be serious you can Sit down McComas after a brief struggle
between his dignity and his friendship succumbs seating himself this
time midway between Dolly and Mrs Clandon You know that all this is
a made up casethat Fergus does not believe in it any more than you do
Now give me your real adviceyour sincere friendly advice you know
I have always trusted your judgment I promise you the children will be
quiet

McCOMAS resigning himself Well well What I want to say is this In
the old arrangement with your husband Mrs Clandon you had him at a
terrible disadvantage

MRS CLANDON How so pray

McCOMAS Well you were an advanced woman accustomed to defy public
opinion and with no regard for what the world might say of you

MRS CLANDON proud of it Yes that is true Gloria behind the
chair stoops and kisses her mothers hair a demonstration which
disconcerts her extremely

McCOMAS On the other hand Mrs Clandon your husband had a great
horror of anything getting into the papers There was his business to be
considered as well as the prejudices of an oldfashioned family

MRS CLANDON Not to mention his own prejudices

McCOMAS Now no doubt he behaved badly Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON scornfully No doubt

McCOMAS But was it altogether his fault

MRS CLANDON Was it mine

McCOMAS hastily No Of course not

GLORIA observing him attentively You do not mean that Mr McComas

McCOMAS My dear young lady you pick me up very sharply But let me
just put this to you When a man makes an unsuitable marriage nobodys
fault you know but purely accidental incompatibility of tastes when
he is deprived by that misfortune of the domestic sympathy which I take
it is what a man marries for when in short his wife is rather worse
than no wife at all through no fault of his own of course is it to
be wondered at if he makes matters worse at first by blaming her
and even in his desperation by occasionally drinking himself into a
violent condition or seeking sympathy elsewhere

MRS CLANDON I did not blame him I simply rescued myself and the
children from him

McCOMAS Yes but you made hard terms Mrs Clandon You had him at
your mercy you brought him to his knees when you threatened to make
the matter public by applying to the Courts for a judicial separation
Suppose he had had that power over you and used it to take your
children away from you and bring them up in ignorance of your very
name how would you feel what would you do Well wont you make some
allowance for his feelingsin common humanity

MRS CLANDON I never discovered his feelings I discovered his temper
and his she shivers the rest of his common humanity

McCOMAS wistfully Women can be very hard Mrs Clandon

VALENTINE Thats true

GLORIA angrily Be silent He subsides

McCOMAS rallying all his forces Let me make one last appeal Mrs
Clandon believe me there are men who have a good deal of feeling and
kind feeling too which they are not able to express What you miss
in Crampton is that mere veneer of civilization the art of shewing
worthless attentions and paying insincere compliments in a kindly
charming way If you lived in London where the whole system is one of
false goodfellowship and you may know a man for twenty years without
finding out that he hates you like poison you would soon have your eyes
opened There we do unkind things in a kind way we say bitter things in
a sweet voice we always give our friends chloroform when we tear them
to pieces But think of the other side of it Think of the people who
do kind things in an unkind waypeople whose touch hurts whose voices
jar whose tempers play them false who wound and worry the people they
love in the very act of trying to conciliate them and yet who need
affection as much as the rest of us Crampton has an abominable temper
I admit He has no manners no tact no grace Hell never be able
to gain anyones affection unless they will take his desire for it on
trust Is he to have nonenot even pityfrom his own flesh and blood

DOLLY quite melted Oh how beautiful Finch How nice of you

PHILIP with conviction Finch this is eloquencepositive eloquence

DOLLY Oh mamma let us give him another chance Let us have him to
dinner

MRS CLANDON unmoved No Dolly I hardly got any lunch My dear
Finch there is not the least use in talking to me about Fergus You
have never been married to him I have

McCOMAS to Gloria Miss Clandon I have hitherto refrained from
appealing to you because if what Mr Crampton told me to be true you
have been more merciless even than your mother

GLORIA defiantly You appeal from her strength to my weakness

McCOMAS Not your weakness Miss Clandon I appeal from her intellect to
your heart

GLORIA I have learnt to mistrust my heart With an angry glance at
Valentine I would tear my heart and throw it away if I could My
answer to you is my mothers answer She goes to Mrs Clandon and
stands with her arm about her but Mrs Clandon unable to endure this
sort of demonstrativeness disengages herself as soon as she can without
hurting Glorias feelings

McCOMAS defeated Well I am very sorryvery sorry I have done my
best He rises and prepares to go deeply dissatisfied

MRS CLANDON But what did you expect Finch What do you want us to do

McCOMAS The first step for both you and Crampton is to obtain counsels
opinion as to whether he is bound by the deed of separation or not Now
why not obtain this opinion at once and have a friendly meeting
her face hardensor shall we say a neutral meetingto settle the
difficultyherein this hoteltonight What do you say

MRS CLANDON But where is the counsels opinion to come from

McCOMAS It has dropped down on us out of the clouds On my way back
here from Cramptons I met a most eminent QC a man whom I briefed in
the case that made his name for him He has come down here from Saturday
to Monday for the sea air and to visit a relative of his who lives
here He has been good enough to say that if I can arrange a meeting
of the parties he will come and help us with his opinion Now do let us
seize this chance of a quiet friendly family adjustment Let me bring my
friend here and try to persuade Crampton to come too Come consent

MRS CLANDON rather ominously after a moments consideration Finch
I dont want counsels opinion because I intend to be guided by my own
opinion I dont want to meet Fergus again because I dont like him
and dont believe the meeting will do any good However rising you
have persuaded the children that he is not quite hopeless Do as you
please

McCOMAS taking her hand and shaking it Thank you Mrs Clandon Will
nine oclock suit you

MRS CLANDON Perfectly Phil will you ring please Phil rings the
bell But if I am to be accused of conspiring with Mr Valentine I
think he had better be present

VALENTINE rising I quite agree with you I think its most important

McCOMAS There can be no objection to that I think I have the greatest
hopes of a happy settlement Goodbye for the present He goes out
meeting the waiter who holds the door for him to pass through

MRS CLANDON We expect some visitors at nine William Can we have
dinner at seven instead of halfpast

WAITER at the door Seven maam Certainly maam It will be a
convenience to us this busy evening maam There will be the band and
the arranging of the fairy lights and one thing or another maam

DOLLY The fairy lights

PHILIP The band William what mean you

WAITER The fancy ball miss

DOLLY and PHILIP simultaneously rushing to him Fancy ball

WAITER Oh yes sir Given by the regatta committee for the benefit
of the Lifeboat sir To Mrs Clandon We often have them maam
Chinese lanterns in the garden maam very bright and pleasant very
gay and innocent indeed To Phil Tickets downstairs at the office
sir five shillings ladies half price if accompanied by a gentleman

PHILIP seizing his arm to drag him off To the office William

DOLLY breathlessly seizing his other arm Quick before theyre all
sold They rush him out of the room between them

MRS CLANDON What on earth are they going to do Going out I really
must go and stop this She follows them speaking as she disappears
Gloria stares coolly at Valentine and then deliberately looks at her
watch

VALENTINE I understand Ive stayed too long Im going

GLORIA with disdainful punctiliousness I owe you some apology Mr
Valentine I am conscious of having spoken somewhat sharply perhaps
rudelyto you

VALENTINE Not at all

GLORIA My only excuse is that it is very difficult to give
consideration and respect when there is no dignity of character on the
other side to command it

VALENTINE prosaically How is a man to look dignified when hes
infatuated

GLORIA effectually unstilted Dont say those things to me I forbid
you They are insults

VALENTINE No theyre only follies I cant help them

GLORIA If you were really in love it would not make you foolish it
would give you dignityearnestnesseven beauty

VALENTINE Do you really think it would make me beautiful She turns
her back on him with the coldest contempt Ah you see youre not in
earnest Love cant give any man new gifts It can only heighten the
gifts he was born with

GLORIA sweeping round at him again What gifts were you born with
pray

VALENTINE Lightness of heart

GLORIA And lightness of head and lightness of faith and lightness of
everything that makes a man

VALENTINE Yes the whole world is like a feather dancing in the light
now and Gloria is the sun She rears her head angrily I beg your
pardon Im off Back at nine Goodbye He runs off gaily leaving her
standing in the middle of the room staring after him

END OF ACT III




ACT IV


The same room Nine oclock Nobody present The lamps are lighted but
the curtains are not drawn The window stands wide open and strings of
Chinese lanterns are glowing among the trees outside with the starry
sky beyond The band is playing dancemusic in the garden drowning the
sound of the sea

The waiter enters shewing in Crampton and McComas Crampton looks cowed
and anxious He sits down wearily and timidly on the ottoman

WAITER The ladies have gone for a turn through the grounds to see the
fancy dresses sir If you will be so good as to take seats gentlemen
I shall tell them He is about to go into the garden through the window
when McComas stops him

McCOMAS One moment If another gentleman comes shew him in without any
delay we are expecting him

WAITER Right sir What name sir

McCOMAS Boon Mr Boon He is a stranger to Mrs Clandon so he may
give you a card If so the name is spelt BOHUN You will not
forget

WAITER smiling You may depend on me for that sir My own name is
Boon sir though I am best known down here as Balmy Walters sir By
rights I should spell it with the aitch you sir but I think it best
not to take that liberty sir There is Norman blood in it sir and
Norman blood is not a recommendation to a waiter

McCOMAS Well well True hearts are more than coronets and simple
faith than Norman blood

WAITER That depends a good deal on ones station in life sir If you
were a waiter sir youd find that simple faith would leave you just
as short as Norman blood I find it best to spell myself B doubleON
and to keep my wits pretty sharp about me But Im taking up your time
sir Youll excuse me sir your own fault for being so affable sir
Ill tell the ladies youre here sir He goes out into the garden
through the window

McCOMAS Crampton I can depend on you cant I

CRAMPTON Yes yes Ill be quiet Ill be patient Ill do my best

McCOMAS Remember Ive not given you away Ive told them it was all
their fault

CRAMPTON You told me that it was all my fault

McCOMAS I told you the truth

CRAMPTON plaintively If they will only be fair to me

McCOMAS My dear Crampton they wont be fair to you its not to be
expected from them at their age If youre going to make impossible
conditions of this kind we may as well go back home at once

CRAMPTON But surely I have a right

McCOMAS intolerantly You wont get your rights Now once for all
Crampton did your promises of good behavior only mean that you wont
complain if theres nothing to complain of Because if so He moves
as if to go

CRAMPTON miserably No no let me alone cant you Ive been bullied
enough Ive been tormented enough I tell you Ill do my best But if
that girl begins to talk to me like that and to look at me like He
breaks off and buries his head in his hands

McCOMAS relenting There there itll be all right if you will only
bear and forbear Come pull yourself together theres someone coming
Crampton too dejected to care much hardly changes his attitude
Gloria enters from the garden McComas goes to meet her at the window
so that he can speak to her without being heard by Crampton There he
is Miss Clandon Be kind to him Ill leave you with him for a moment
He goes into the garden Gloria comes in and strolls coolly down the
middle of the room

CRAMPTON looking round in alarm Wheres McComas

GLORIA listlessly but not unsympathetically Gone outto leave us
together Delicacy on his part I suppose She stops beside him and
looks quaintly down at him Well father

CRAMPTON a quaint jocosity breaking through his forlornness Well
daughter They look at one another for a moment with a melancholy
sense of humor

GLORIA Shake hands They shake hands

CRAMPTON holding her hand My dear Im afraid I spoke very improperly
of your mother this afternoon

GLORIA Oh dont apologize I was very high and mighty myself but Ive
come down since oh yes Ive been brought down She sits on the floor
beside his chair

CRAMPTON What has happened to you my child

GLORIA Oh never mind I was playing the part of my mothers daughter
then but Im not Im my fathers daughter Looking at him funnily
Thats a come down isnt it

CRAMPTON angry What Her odd expression does not alter He
surrenders Well yes my dear I suppose it is I suppose it is She
nods sympathetically Im afraid Im sometimes a little irritable but
I know whats right and reasonable all the time even when I dont act
on it Can you believe that

GLORIA Believe it Why thats myselfmyself all over I know whats
right and dignified and strong and noble just as well as she does but
oh the things I do the things I do the things I let other people do

CRAMPTON a little grudgingly in spite of himself As well as she does
You mean your mother

GLORIA quickly Yes mother She turns to him on her knees and seizes
his hands Now listen No treason to her no word no thought against
her She is our superioryours and minehigh heavens above us Is that
agreed

CRAMPTON Yes yes Just as you please my dear

GLORIA not satisfied letting go his hands and drawing back from him
You dont like her

CRAMPTON My child you havent been married to her I have She raises
herself slowly to her feet looking at him with growing coldness She
did me a great wrong in marrying me without really caring for me But
after that the wrong was all on my side I dare say He offers her his
hand again

GLORIA taking it firmly and warningly Take care Thats a dangerous
subject My feelingsmy miserable cowardly womanly feelingsmay be
on your side but my conscience is on hers

CRAMPTON Im very well content with that division my dear Thank you
Valentine arrives Gloria immediately becomes deliberately haughty

VALENTINE Excuse me but its impossible to find a servant to announce
one even the never failing William seems to be at the ball I should
have gone myself only I havent five shillings to buy a ticket How are
you getting on Crampton Better eh

CRAMPTON I am myself again Mr Valentine no thanks to you

VALENTINE Look at this ungrateful parent of yours Miss Clandon I
saved him from an excruciating pang and he reviles me

GLORIA coldly I am sorry my mother is not here to receive you Mr
Valentine It is not quite nine oclock and the gentleman of whom Mr
McComas spoke the lawyer is not yet come

VALENTINE Oh yes he is Ive met him and talked to him With gay
malice Youll like him Miss Clandon hes the very incarnation of
intellect You can hear his mind working

GLORIA ignoring the jibe Where is he

VALENTINE Bought a false nose and gone into the fancy ball

CRAMPTON crustily looking at his watch It seems that everybody has
gone to this fancy ball instead of keeping to our appointment here

VALENTINE Oh hell come all right enough that was half an hour ago
I didnt like to borrow five shillings from him and go in with him so
I joined the mob and looked through the railings until Miss Clandon
disappeared into the hotel through the window

GLORIA So it has come to this that you follow me about in public to
stare at me

VALENTINE Yes somebody ought to chain me up

Gloria turns her back on him and goes to the fireplace He takes the
snub very philosophically and goes to the opposite side of the room
The waiter appears at the window ushering in Mrs Clandon and McComas

MRS CLANDON hurrying in I am so sorry to have kept you waiting

A grotesquely majestic stranger in a domino and false nose with
goggles appears at the window

WAITER to the stranger Beg pardon sir but this is a private
apartment sir If you will allow me sir I will shew you to the
American bar and supper rooms sir This way sir

He goes into the gardens leading the way under the impression that the
stranger is following him The majestic one however comes straight
into the room to the end of the table where with impressive
deliberation he takes off the false nose and then the domino rolling
up the nose into the domino and throwing the bundle on the table like a
champion throwing down his glove He is now seen to be a stout tall
man between forty and fifty clean shaven with a midnight oil pallor
emphasized by stiff black hair cropped short and oiled and eyebrows
like early Victorian horsehair upholstery Physically and spiritually
a coarsened man in cunning and logic a ruthlessly sharpened one His
bearing as he enters is sufficiently imposing and disquieting but
when he speaks his powerful menacing voice impressively articulated
speech strong inexorable manner and a terrifying power of intensely
critical listening raise the impression produced by him to absolute
tremendousness

THE STRANGER My name is Bohun General awe Have I the honor of
addressing Mrs Clandon Mrs Clandon bows Bohun bows Miss Clandon
Gloria bows Bohun bows Mr Clandon

CRAMPTON insisting on his rightful name as angrily as he dares My
name is Crampton sir

BOHUN Oh indeed Passing him over without further notice and turning
to Valentine Are you Mr Clandon

VALENTINE making it a point of honor not to be impressed by him Do I
look like it My name is Valentine I did the drugging

BOHUN Ah quite so Then Mr Clandon has not yet arrived

WAITER entering anxiously through the window Beg pardon maam but
can you tell me what became of that He recognizes Bohun and loses
all his selfpossession Bohun waits rigidly for him to pull himself
together After a pathetic exhibition of confusion he recovers himself
sufficiently to address Bohun weakly but coherently Beg pardon sir
Im sure sir Waswas it you sir

BOHUN ruthlessly It was I

WAITER brokenly Yes sir Unable to restrain his tears You in a
false nose Walter He sinks faintly into a chair at the table I beg
pardon maam Im sure A little giddiness

BOHUN commandingly You will excuse him Mrs Clandon when I inform
you that he is my father

WAITER heartbroken Oh no no Walter A waiter for your father on
the top of a false nose What will they think of you

MRS CLANDON going to the waiters chair in her kindest manner I
am delighted to hear it Mr Bohun Your father has been an excellent
friend to us since we came here Bohun bows gravely

WAITER shaking his head Oh no maam Its very kind of you
very ladylike and affable indeed maam but I should feel at a
great disadvantage off my own proper footing Never mind my being the
gentlemans father maam it is only the accident of birth after all
maam He gets up feebly Youll all excuse me Im sure having
interrupted your business He begins to make his way along the table
supporting himself from chair to chair with his eye on the door

BOHUN One moment The waiter stops with a sinking heart My father
was a witness of what passed today was he not Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON Yes most of it I think

BOHUN In that case we shall want him

WAITER pleading I hope it may not be necessary sir Busy evening for
me sir with that ball very busy evening indeed sir

BOHUN inexorably We shall want you

MRS CLANDON politely Sit down wont you

WAITER earnestly Oh if you please maam I really must draw the
line at sitting down I couldnt let myself be seen doing such a thing
maam thank you I am sure all the same He looks round from face to
face wretchedly with an expression that would melt a heart of stone

GLORIA Dont let us waste time William only wants to go on taking care
of us I should like a cup of coffee

WAITER brightening perceptibly Coffee miss He gives a little gasp
of hope Certainly miss Thank you miss very timely miss very
thoughtful and considerate indeed To Mrs Clandon timidly but
expectantly Anything for you maam

MRS CLANDON Eroh yes its so hot I think we might have a jug of
claret cup

WAITER beaming Claret cup maam Certainly maam

GLORIA Oh well Ill have a claret cup instead of coffee Put some
cucumber in it

WAITER delighted Cucumber miss yes miss To Bohun Anything
special for you sir You dont like cucumber sir

BOHUN If Mrs Clandon will allow mesyphonScotch

WAITER Right sir To Crampton Irish for you sir I think
sir Crampton assents with a grunt The waiter looks enquiringly at
Valentine

VALENTINE I like the cucumber

WAITER Right sir Summing up Claret cup syphon one Scotch and one
Irish

MRS CLANDON I think thats right

WAITER perfectly happy Right maam Directly maam Thank you He
ambles off through the window having sounded the whole gamut of human
happiness from the bottom to the top in a little over two minutes

McCOMAS We can begin now I suppose

BOHUN We had better wait until Mrs Clandons husband arrives

CRAMPTON What dy mean Im her husband

BOHUN instantly pouncing on the inconsistency between this and his
previous statement You said just now your name was Crampton

CRAMPTON So it is

MRS CLANDON  all four  I

GLORIA  speaking  My

McCOMAS  simul  Mrs

VALENTINE  taneously  You

BOHUN drowning them in two thunderous words One moment Dead
silence Pray allow me Sit down everybody They obey humbly Gloria
takes the saddlebag chair on the hearth Valentine slips around to her
side of the room and sits on the ottoman facing the window so that
he can look at her Crampton sits on the ottoman with his back to
Valentines Mrs Clandon who has all along kept at the opposite side
of the room in order to avoid Crampton as much as possible sits near
the door with McComas beside her on her left Bohun places himself
magisterially in the centre of the group near the corner of the table
on Mrs Clandons side When they are settled he fixes Crampton with
his eye and begins In this family it appears the husbands name is
Crampton the wifes Clandon Thus we have on the very threshold of the
case an element of confusion

VALENTINE getting up and speaking across to him with one knee on the
ottoman But its perfectly simple

BOHUN annihilating him with a vocal thunderbolt It is Mrs Clandon
has adopted another name That is the obvious explanation which you
feared I could not find out for myself You mistrust my intelligence
Mr Valentine Stopping him as he is about to protest No I dont
want you to answer that I want you to think over it when you feel your
next impulse to interrupt me

VALENTINE dazed This is simply breaking a butterfly on a wheel What
does it matter He sits down again

BOHUN I will tell you what it matters sir It matters that if this
family difference is to be smoothed over as we all hope it may be Mrs
Clandon as a matter of social convenience and decency will have to
resume her husbands name Mrs Clandon assumes an expression of the
most determined obstinacy Or else Mr Crampton will have to call
himself Mr Clandon Crampton looks indomitably resolved to do nothing
of the sort No doubt you think that an easy matter Mr Valentine He
looks pointedly at Mrs Clandon then at Crampton I differ from you
He throws himself back in his chair frowning heavily

McCOMAS timidly I think Bohun we had perhaps better dispose of the
important questions first

BOHUN McComas there will be no difficulty about the important
questions There never is It is the trifles that will wreck you at the
harbor mouth McComas looks as if he considered this a paradox You
dont agree with me eh

McCOMAS flatteringly If I did

BOHUN interrupting him If you did you would be me instead of being
what you are

McCOMAS fawning on him Of course Bohun your specialty

BOHUN again interrupting him My specialty is being right when other
people are wrong If you agreed with me I should be of no use here He
nods at him to drive the point home then turns suddenly and forcibly on
Crampton Now you Mr Crampton what point in this business have you
most at heart

CRAMPTON beginning slowly I wish to put all considerations of self
aside in this matter

BOHUN interrupting him So do we all Mr Crampton To Mrs Clandon
Y o u wish to put self aside Mrs Clandon

MRS CLANDON Yes I am not consulting my own feelings in being here

BOHUN So do you Miss Clandon

GLORIA Yes

BOHUN I thought so We all do

VALENTINE Except me My aims are selfish

BOHUN Thats because you think an impression of sincerity will produce
a better effect on Miss Clandon than an impression of disinterestedness
Valentine utterly dismantled and destroyed by this just remark takes
refuge in a feeble speechless smile Bohun satisfied at having now
effectually crushed all rebellion throws himself back in his chair
with an air of being prepared to listen tolerantly to their grievances
Now Mr Crampton go on Its understood that self is put aside Human
nature always begins by saying that

CRAMPTON But I mean it sir

BOHUN Quite so Now for your point

CRAMPTON Every reasonable person will admit that its an unselfish
onethe children

BOHUN Well What about the children

CRAMPTON with emotion They have

BOHUN pouncing forward again Stop Youre going to tell me about your
feelings Mr Crampton Dont I sympathize with them but theyre not
my business Tell us exactly what you want thats what we have to get
at

CRAMPTON uneasily Its a very difficult question to answer Mr
Bohun

BOHUN Come Ill help you out What do you object to in the present
circumstances of the children

CRAMPTON I object to the way they have been brought up

BOHUN How do you propose to alter that now

CRAMPTON I think they ought to dress more quietly

VALENTINE Nonsense

BOHUN instantly flinging himself back in his chair outraged by the
interruption When you are done Mr Valentinewhen you are quite
done

VALENTINE Whats wrong with Miss Clandons dress

CRAMPTON hotly to Valentine My opinion is as good as yours

GLORIA warningly Father

CRAMPTON subsiding piteously I didnt mean you my dear Pleading
earnestly to Bohun But the two younger ones you have not seen them
Mr Bohun and indeed I think you would agree with me that there is
something very noticeable something almost gay and frivolous in their
style of dressing

MRS CLANDON impatiently Do you suppose I choose their clothes for
them Really this is childish

CRAMPTON furious rising Childish Mrs Clandon rises indignantly

McCOMAS  all ris  Crampton you promised

VALENTINE  ing and  Ridiculous They dress

  speaking  charmingly

GLORIA  together  Pray let us behave reasonably

Tumult Suddenly they hear a chime of glasses in the room behind them
They turn in silent surprise and find that the waiter has just come back
from the bar in the garden and is jingling his tray warningly as he
comes softly to the table with it

WAITER to Crampton setting a tumbler apart on the table Irish for
you sir Crampton sits down a little shamefacedly The waiter sets
another tumbler and a syphon apart saying to Bohun Scotch and syphon
for you sir Bohun waves his hand impatiently The waiter places a
large glass jug in the middle And claret cup All subside into their
seats Peace reigns

MRS CLANDON humbly to Bohun I am afraid we interrupted you Mr
Bohun

BOHUN calmly You did To the waiter who is going out Just wait a
bit

WAITER Yes sir Certainly sir He takes his stand behind Bohuns
chair

MRS CLANDON to the waiter You dont mind our detaining you I hope
Mr Bohun wishes it

WAITER now quite at his ease Oh no maam not at all maam It
is a pleasure to me to watch the working of his trained and powerful
mindvery stimulating very entertaining and instructive indeed maam

BOHUN resuming command of the proceedings Now Mr Crampton we are
waiting for you Do you give up your objection to the dressing or do
you stick to it

CRAMPTON pleading Mr Bohun consider my position for a moment I
havent got myself alone to consider theres my sister Sophronia and
my brotherinlaw and all their circle They have a great horror of
anything that is at allat allwell

BOHUN Out with it Fast Loud Gay

CRAMPTON Not in any unprincipled sense of course butbut blurting
it out desperately those two children would shock them Theyre not fit
to mix with their own people Thats what I complain of

MRS CLANDON with suppressed impatience Mr Valentine do you think
there is anything fast or loud about Phil and Dolly

VALENTINE Certainly not Its utter bosh Nothing can be in better
taste

CRAMPTON Oh yes of course you say so

MRS CLANDON William you see a great deal of good English society Are
my children overdressed

WAITER reassuringly Oh dear no maam Persuasively Oh no
sir not at all A little pretty and tasty no doubt but very choice
and classyvery genteel and high toned indeed Might be the son and
daughter of a Dean sir I assure you sir You have only to look at
them sir to At this moment a harlequin and columbine dancing to
the music of the band in the garden which has just reached the coda of
a waltz whirl one another into the room The harlequins dress is
made of lozenges an inch square of turquoise blue silk and gold
alternately His hat is gilt and his mask turned up The columbines
petticoats are the epitome of a harvest field golden orange and poppy
crimson with a tiny velvet jacket for the poppy stamens They pass an
exquisite and dazzling apparition between McComas and Bohun and then
back in a circle to the end of the table where as the final chord of
the waltz is struck they make a tableau in the middle of the company
the harlequin down on his left knee and the columbine standing on his
right knee with her arms curved over her head Unlike their dancing
which is charmingly graceful their attitudinizing is hardly a success
and threatens to end in a catastrophe

THE COLUMBINE screaming Lift me down somebody Im going to fall
Papa lift me down

CRAMPTON anxiously running to her and taking her hands My child

DOLLY jumping down with his help Thanks so nice of you Phil
putting his hat into his belt sits on the side of the table and pours
out some claret cup Crampton returns to his place on the ottoman in
great perplexity Oh what fun Oh dear She seats herself with a
vault on the front edge of the table panting Oh claret cup She
drinks

BOHUN in powerful tones This is the younger lady is it

DOLLY slipping down off the table in alarm at his formidable voice and
manner Yes sir Please who are you

MRS CLANDON This is Mr Bohun Dolly who has very kindly come to help
us this evening

DOLLY Oh then he comes as a boon and a blessing

PHILIP Sh

CRAMPTON Mr BohunMcComas I appeal to you Is this right Would you
blame my sisters family for objecting to this

DOLLY flushing ominously Have you begun again

CRAMPTON propitiating her No no Its perhaps natural at your age

DOLLY obstinately Never mind my age Is it pretty

CRAMPTON Yes dear yes He sits down in token of submission

DOLLY following him insistently Do you like it

CRAMPTON My child how can you expect me to like it or to approve of
it

DOLLY determined not to let him off How can you think it pretty and
not like it

McCOMAS rising angry and scandalized Really I must say Bohun
who has listened to Dolly with the highest approval is down on him
instantly

BOHUN No dont interrupt McComas The young ladys method is right
To Dolly with tremendous emphasis Press your questions Miss
Clandon press your questions

DOLLY rising Oh dear you are a regular overwhelmer Do you always
go on like this

BOHUN rising Yes Dont you try to put me out of countenance young
lady youre too young to do it He takes McComass chair from
beside Mrs Clandons and sets it beside his own Sit down Dolly
fascinated obeys and Bohun sits down again McComas robbed of
his seat takes a chair on the other side between the table and the
ottoman Now Mr Crampton the facts are before youboth of them You
think youd like to have your two youngest children to live with you
Well you wouldnt Crampton tries to protest but Bohun will not
have it on any terms No you wouldnt you think you would but I know
better than you Youd want this young lady here to give up dressing
like a stage columbine in the evening and like a fashionable columbine
in the morning Well she wontnever She thinks she will but

DOLLY interrupting him No I dont Resolutely Ill n e v e r give
up dressing prettily Never As Gloria said to that man in Madeira
never never never while grass grows or water runs

VALENTINE rising in the wildest agitation What What Beginning to
speak very fast When did she say that Who did she say that to

BOHUN throwing himself back with massive pitying remonstrance Mr
Valentine

VALENTINE pepperily Dont you interrupt me sir this is something
really serious I i n s i s t on knowing who Miss Clandon said that to

DOLLY Perhaps Phil remembers Which was it Phil number three or
number five

VALENTINE Number five

PHILIP Courage Valentine It wasnt number five it was only a tame
naval lieutenant that was always on handthe most patient and harmless
of mortals

GLORIA coldly What are we discussing now pray

VALENTINE very red Excuse me I am sorry I interrupted I shall
intrude no further Mrs Clandon He bows to Mrs Clandon and marches
away into the garden boiling with suppressed rage

DOLLY Hmhm

PHILIP Ahah

GLORIA Please go on Mr Bohun

DOLLY striking in as Bohun frowning formidably collects himself for a
fresh grapple with the case Youre going to bully us Mr Bohun

BOHUN I

DOLLY interrupting him Oh yes you are you think youre not but
you are I know by your eyebrows

BOHUN capitulating Mrs Clandon these are clever children clear
headed well brought up children I make that admission deliberately
Can you in return point out to me any way of inducting them to hold
their tongues

MRS CLANDON Dolly dearest

PHILIP Our old failing Dolly Silence Dolly holds her mouth

MRS CLANDON Now Mr Bohun before they begin again

WAITER softer Be quick sir be quick

DOLLY beaming at him Dear William

PHILIP Sh

BOHUN unexpectedly beginning by hurling a question straight at Dolly
Have you any intention of getting married

DOLLY I Well Finch calls me by my Christian name

McCOMAS I will not have this Mr Bohun I use the young ladys
Christian name naturally as an old friend of her mothers

DOLLY Yes you call me Dolly as an old friend of my mothers But what
about Dorotheeeea McComas rises indignantly

CRAMPTON anxiously rising to restrain him Keep your temper McComas
Dont let us quarrel Be patient

McCOMAS I will not be patient You are shewing the most wretched
weakness of character Crampton I say this is monstrous

DOLLY Mr Bohun please bully Finch for us

BOHUN I will McComas youre making yourself ridiculous Sit down

McCOMAS I

BOHUN waving him down imperiously No sit down sit down McComas
sits down sulkily and Crampton much relieved follows his example

DOLLY to Bohun meekly Thank you

BOHUN Now listen to me all of you I give no opinion McComas as
to how far you may or may not have committed yourself in the direction
indicated by this young lady McComas is about to protest No dont
interrupt me if she doesnt marry you she will marry somebody else
That is the solution of the difficulty as to her not bearing her
fathers name The other lady intends to get married

GLORIA flushing Mr Bohun

BOHUN Oh yes you do you dont know it but you do

GLORIA rising Stop I warn you Mr Bohun not to answer for my
intentions

BOHUN rising Its no use Miss Clandon you cant put me down I tell
you your name will soon be neither Clandon nor Crampton and I could
tell you what it will be if I chose He goes to the other end of the
table where he unrolls his domino and puts the false nose on the
table When he moves they all rise and Phil goes to the window Bohun
with a gesture summons the waiter to help him in robing Mr Crampton
your notion of going to law is all nonsense your children will be of
age before you could get the point decided Allowing the waiter to put
the domino on his shoulders You can do nothing but make a friendly
arrangement If you want your family more than they want you youll get
the worse of the arrangement if they want you more than you want them
youll get the better of it He shakes the domino into becoming
folds and takes up the false nose Dolly gazes admiringly at him The
strength of their position lies in their being very agreeable people
personally The strength of your position lies in your income He claps
on the false nose and is again grotesquely transfigured

DOLLY running to him Oh now you look quite like a human being
Maynt I have just one dance with you C a n you dance Phil resuming
his part of harlequin waves his hat as if casting a spell on them

BOHUN thunderously Yes you think I cant but I can Come along He
seizes her and dances off with her through the window in a most powerful
manner but with studied propriety and grace The waiter is meanwhile
busy putting the chairs back in their customary places

PHILIP On with the dance let joy be unconfined William

WAITER Yes sir

PHILIP Can you procure a couple of dominos and false noses for my
father and Mr McComas

McCOMAS Most certainly not I protest

CRAMPTON No no What harm will it do just for once McComas Dont
let us be spoilsports

McCOMAS Crampton you are not the man I took you for Pointedly
Bullies are always cowards He goes disgustedly towards the window

CRAMPTON following him Well never mind We must indulge them a
little Can you get us something to wear waiter

WAITER Certainly sir He precedes them to the window and stands
aside there to let them pass out before him This way sir Dominos and
noses sir

McCOMAS angrily on his way out I shall wear my own nose

WAITER suavely Oh dear yes sir the false one will fit over it
quite easily sir plenty of room sir plenty of room He goes out
after McComas

CRAMPTON turning at the window to Phil with an attempt at genial
fatherliness Come along my boy come along He goes

PHILIP cheerily following him Coming dad coming On the window
threshold he stops looking after Crampton then turns fantastically
with his bat bent into a halo round his head and says with a lowered
voice to Mrs Clandon and Gloria Did you feel the pathos of that He
vanishes

MRS CLANDON left alone with Gloria Why did Mr Valentine go away so
suddenly I wonder

GLORIA petulantly I dont know Yes I d o know Let us go and see
the dancing They go towards the window and are met by Valentine who
comes in from the garden walking quickly with his face set and sulky

VALENTINE stiffly Excuse me I thought the party had quite broken up

GLORIA nagging Then why did you come back

VALENTINE I came back because I am penniless I cant get out that way
without a five shilling ticket

MRS CLANDON Has anything annoyed you Mr Valentine

GLORIA Never mind him mother This is a fresh insult to me that is
all

MRS CLANDON hardly able to realize that Gloria is deliberately
provoking an altercation Gloria

VALENTINE Mrs Clandon have I said anything insulting Have I done
anything insulting

GLORIA you have implied that my past has been like yours That is the
worst of insults

VALENTINE I imply nothing of the sort I declare that my past has been
blameless in comparison with yours

MRS CLANDON most indignantly Mr Valentine

VALENTINE Well what am I to think when I learn that Miss Clandon
has made exactly the same speeches to other men that she has made
to mewhen I hear of at least five former lovers with a tame naval
lieutenant thrown in Oh its too bad

MRS CLANDON But you surely do not believe that these affairs mere
jokes of the childrenswere serious Mr Valentine

VALENTINE Not to younot to her perhaps But I know what the men
felt With ludicrously genuine earnestness Have you ever thought
of the wrecked lives the marriages contracted in the recklessness of
despair the suicides thethethe

GLORIA interrupting him contemptuously Mother this man is a
sentimental idiot She sweeps away to the fireplace

MRS CLANDON shocked Oh my d e a r e s t Gloria Mr Valentine will
think that rude

VALENTINE I am not a sentimental idiot I am cured of sentiment for
ever He sits down in dudgeon

MRS CLANDON Mr Valentine you must excuse us all Women have to
unlearn the false good manners of their slavery before they acquire the
genuine good manners of their freedom Dont think Gloria vulgar Gloria
turns astonished she is not really so

GLORIA Mother You apologize for me to h i m

MRS CLANDON My dear you have some of the faults of youth as well as
its qualities and Mr Valentine seems rather too old fashioned in his
ideas about his own sex to like being called an idiot And now had we
not better go and see what Dolly is doing She goes towards the window
Valentine rises

GLORIA Do you go mother I wish to speak to Mr Valentine alone

MRS CLANDON startled into a remonstrance My dear Recollecting
herself I beg your pardon Gloria Certainly if you wish She bows
to Valentine and goes out

VALENTINE Oh if your mother were only a widow Shes worth six of you

GLORIA That is the first thing I have heard you say that does you
honor

VALENTINE Stuff Come say what you want to say and let me go

GLORIA I have only this to say You dragged me down to your level for
a moment this afternoon Do you think if that had ever happened before
that I should not have been on my guardthat I should not have known
what was coming and known my own miserable weakness

VALENTINE scolding at her passionately Dont talk of it in that way
What do I care for anything in you but your weakness as you call it
You thought yourself very safe didnt you behind your advanced ideas
I amused myself by upsetting t h e m pretty easily

GLORIA insolently feeling that now she can do as she likes with him
Indeed

VALENTINE But why did I do it Because I was being tempted to awaken
your heartto stir the depths in you Why was I tempted Because Nature
was in deadly earnest with me when I was in jest with her When the
great moment came who was awakened who was stirred in whom did the
depths break up In myselfm y s e l f I was transported you were
only offendedshocked You were only an ordinary young lady too
ordinary to allow tame lieutenants to go as far as I went Thats all
I shall not trouble you with conventional apologies Goodbye He makes
resolutely for the door

GLORIA Stop He hesitates Oh will you understand if I tell you the
truth that I am not making an advance to you

VALENTINE Pooh I know what youre going to say You think youre not
ordinarythat I was rightthat you really have those depths in your
nature It flatters you to believe it She recoils Well I grant that
you are not ordinary in some ways you are a clever girl Gloria stifles
an exclamation of rage and takes a threatening step towards him but
youve not been awakened yet You didnt care you dont care It was
my tragedy not yours Goodbye He turns to the door She watches him
appalled to see him slipping from her grasp As he turns the handle he
pauses then turns again to her offering his hand Let us part kindly

GLORIA enormously relieved and immediately turning her back on him
deliberately Goodbye I trust you will soon recover from the wound

VALENTINE brightening up as it flashes on him that he is master of the
situation after all I shall recover such wounds heal more than they
harm After all I still have my own Gloria

GLORIA facing him quickly What do you mean

VALENTINE The Gloria of my imagination

GLORIA proudly Keep your own Gloriathe Gloria of your imagination
Her emotion begins to break through her pride The real Gloriathe
Gloria who was shocked offended horrifiedoh yes quite trulywho
was driven almost mad with shame by the feeling that all her power over
herself had been broken down at her first real encounter withwith
The color rushes over her face again She covers it with her left hand
and puts her right on his left arm to support herself

VALENTINE Take care Im losing my senses again Summoning all her
courage she takes away her hand from her face and puts it on his right
shoulder turning him towards her and looking him straight in the eyes
He begins to protest agitatedly Gloria be sensible its no use I
havent a penny in the world

GLORIA Cant you earn one Other people do

VALENTINE half delighted half frightened I never couldyoud
be unhappy My dearest love I should be the merest fortunehunting
adventurer if Her grip on his arms tightens and she kisses him
Oh Lord Breathless Oh I He gasps I dont know anything about
women twelve years experience is not enough In a gust of jealousy
she throws him away from her and he reels her back into the chair like
a leaf before the wind as Dolly dances in waltzing with the waiter
followed by Mrs Clandon and Finch also waltzing and Phil pirouetting
by himself

DOLLY sinking on the chair at the writingtable Oh Im out of
breath How beautifully you waltz William

MRS CLANDON sinking on the saddlebag seat on the hearth Oh how
could you make me do such a silly thing Finch I havent danced since
the soiree at South Place twenty years ago

GLORIA peremptorily at Valentine Get up Valentine gets up
abjectly Now let us have no false delicacy Tell my mother that we
have agreed to marry one another A silence of stupefaction ensues
Valentine dumb with panic looks at them with an obvious impulse to run
away

DOLLY breaking the silence Number Six

PHILIP Sh

DOLLY tumultuously Oh my feelings I want to kiss somebody and we
bar it in the family Wheres Finch

McCOMAS starting violently No positively Crampton appears in the
window

DOLLY running to Crampton Oh youre just in time She kisses him
Now leading him forward bless them

GLORIA No I will have no such thing even in jest When I need a
blessing I shall ask my mothers

CRAMPTON to Gloria with deep disappointment Am I to understand that
you have engaged yourself to this young gentleman

GLORIA resolutely Yes Do you intend to be our friend or

DOLLY interposing or our father

CRAMPTON I should like to be both my child But surely Mr
Valentine I appeal to your sense of honor

VALENTINE Youre quite right Its perfect madness If we go out to
dance together I shall have to borrow five shillings from her for a
ticket Gloria dont be rash youre throwing yourself away Id much
better clear straight out of this and never see any of you again I
shant commit suicide I shant even be unhappy Itll be a relief to
me IIm frightened Im positively frightened and thats the plain
truth

GLORIA determinedly You shall not go

VALENTINE quailing No dearest of course not Butoh will somebody
only talk sense for a moment and bring us all to reason I cant
Wheres Bohun Bohuns the man Phil go and summon Bohun

PHILIP From the vastly deep I go He makes his bat quiver in the air
and darts away through the window

WAITER harmoniously to Valentine If you will excuse my putting in a
word sir do not let a matter of five shillings stand between you and
your happiness sir We shall be only too pleased to put the ticket down
to you and you can settle at your convenience Very glad to meet you in
any way very happy and pleased indeed sir

PHILIP reappearing He comes He waves his bat over the window
Bohun comes in taking off his false nose and throwing it on the table
in passing as he comes between Gloria and Valentine

VALENTINE The point is Mr Bohun

McCOMAS interrupting from the hearthrug Excuse me sir the point
must be put to him by a solicitor The question is one of an engagement
between these two young people The lady has some property and looking
at Crampton will probably have a good deal more

CRAMPTON Possibly I hope so

VALENTINE And the gentleman hasnt a rap

BOHUN nailing Valentine to the point instantly Then insist on a
settlement That shocks your delicacy most sensible precautions do But
you ask my advice and I give it to you Have a settlement

GLORIA proudly He shall have a settlement

VALENTINE My good sir I dont want advice for myself Give h e r some
advice

BOHUN She wont take it When youre married she wont take yours
either turning suddenly on Gloria oh no you wont you think you
will but you wont Hell set to work and earn his living turning
suddenly to Valentine oh yes you will you think you wont but you
will Shell make you

CRAMPTON only half persuaded Then Mr Bohun you dont think this
match an unwise one

BOHUN Yes I do all matches are unwise Its unwise to be born its
unwise to be married its unwise to live and its unwise to die

WAITER insinuating himself between Crampton and Valentine Then if
I may respectfully put in a word in sir so much the worse for
wisdom To Valentine benignly Cheer up sir cheer up every man is
frightened of marriage when it comes to the point but it often turns
out very comfortable very enjoyable and happy indeed sirfrom time
to time I never was master in my own house sir my wife was like your
young lady she was of a commanding and masterful disposition which my
son has inherited But if I had my life to live twice over Id do it
again Id do it again I assure you You never can tell sir you never
can tell

PHILIP Allow me to remark that if Gloria has made up her mind

DOLLY The matters settled and Valentines done for And were missing
all the dances

VALENTINE to Gloria gallantly making the best of it May I have a
dance

BOHUN interposing in his grandest diapason Excuse me I claim that
privilege as counsels fee May I have the honorthank you He dances
away with Gloria and disappears among the lanterns leaving Valentine
gasping

VALENTINE recovering his breath Dolly may I offering himself as
her partner

DOLLY Nonsense Eluding him and running round the table to the
fireplace Finchmy Finch She pounces on McComas and makes him
dance

McCOMAS protesting Pray restrainreallyHe is borne off dancing
through the window

VALENTINE making a last effort Mrs Clandon may I

PHILIP forestalling him Come mother He seizes his mother and
whirls her away

MRS CLANDON remonstrating Phil Phil She shares McComass fate

CRAMPTON following them with senile glee Ho ho He he he He goes
into the garden chuckling at the fun

VALENTINE collapsing on the ottoman and staring at the waiter I might
as well be a married man already The waiter contemplates the captured
Duellist of Sex with affectionate commiseration shaking his head
slowly

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
