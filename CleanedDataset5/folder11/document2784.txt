COLONEL STARBOTTLES CLIENT


CHAPTER I


It may be remembered that it was the habit of that gallant warhorse
of the Calaveras democracy Colonel Starbottle at the close of a
political campaign to return to his original profession of the
Law Perhaps it could not be called a peaceful retirement The same
fierytongued eloquence and fullbreasted chivalry which had in turns
thrilled and overawed freemen at the polls were no less fervid and
embattled before a jury Yet the Colonel was counsel for two or three
pastoral Ditch companies and certain bucolic corporations and although
he managed to import into the simplest question of contract more or less
abuse of opposing counsel and occasionally mingled precedents of law
with antecedents of his adversary his legal victories were seldom
complicated by bloodshed He was only once shot at by a freehanded
judge and twice assaulted by an oversensitive litigant Nevertheless
it was thought merely prudent while preparing the papers in the well
known case of The Arcadian Shepherds Association of Tuolumne versus
the Kedron Vine and Fig Tree Growers of Calaveras that the Colonel
should seek with a shotgun the seclusion of his partners law office
in the sylvan outskirts of Rough and Ready for that complete rest and
serious preoccupation which Marysville could not afford

It was an exceptionally hot day The painted shingles of the plain
wooden onestoried building in which the Colonel sat were warped and
blistering in the direct rays of the fierce untempered sun The tin
sign bearing the dazzling legend Starbottle and Bungstarter Attorneys
and Counselors glowed with an insufferable light the two pinetrees
still left in the clearing around the house ineffective as shade
seemed only to have absorbed the daylong heat through every scorched
and crisp twig and fibre to radiate it again with the pungent smell of
a slowly smouldering fire the air was motionless yet vibrating in the
sunlight on distant shallows the halfdried river was flashing and
intolerable

Seated in a wooden armchair before a table covered with books and
papers yet with that apparently haughty attitude towards it affected
by gentlemen of abdominal fullness Colonel Starbottle supported himself
with one hand grasping the arm of his chair and the other vigorously
plying a huge palmleaf fan He was perspiring freely He had taken off
his characteristic blue frockcoat waistcoat cravat and collar and
stripped only to his ruffled shirt and white drill trousers presented
the appearance from the opposite side of the table of having hastily
risen to work in his nightgown A glass with a thin sediment of sugar
and lemonpeel remaining in it stood near his elbow Suddenly a black
shadow fell on the staring uncarpeted hall It was that of a stranger
who had just entered from the noiseless dust of the deserted road The
Colonel cast a rapid glance at his swordcane which lay on the table

But the stranger although sallow and moroselooking was evidently
of pacific intent He paused on the threshold in a kind of surly
embarrassment

I reckon this is Colonel Starbottle he said at last glancing
gloomily round him as if the interview was not entirely of his own
seeking Well Ive seen you often enough though you dont know me My
names Jo Corbin I guess he added still discontentedly I have to
consult you about something

Corbin repeated the Colonel in his jauntiest manner Ah Any
relation to old Maje Corbin of Nashville sir

No said the stranger briefly Im from Shelbyville

The Major continued the Colonel half closing his eyes as if to
follow the Major into the dreamy past the old Major sir a matter
of five or six years ago was one of my most intimate political
friendsin fact sir my most intimate friend Take a chyar

But the stranger had already taken one and during the Colonels
reminiscence had leaned forward with his eyes on the ground
discontentedly swinging his soft hat between his legs Did you know Tom
Frisbee of Yolo he asked abruptly

Erno

Nor even heard anything about Frisbee nor what happened to him
continued the man with aggrieved melancholy

In point of fact the Colonel did not think that he had

Nor anything about his being killed over at Fresno said the stranger
with a desponding implication that the interview after all was a
failure

Iferif you couldergive me a hint or two suggested the Colonel
blandly

There wasnt much said the stranger if you dont remember He
paused then rising he gloomily dragged his chair slowly beside
the table and taking up a paperweight examined it with heavy
dissatisfaction You see he went on slowly I killed himit was a
quoll He was my pardner but I reckon he must have drove me hard Yes
sir he added with aggrieved reflection I reckon he drove me hard

The Colonel smiled courteously slightly expanding his chest under the
homicidal relation as if having taken it in and made it a part of
himself he was ready if necessary to become personally responsible
for it Then lifting his empty glass to the light he looked at it with
half closed eyes in polite imitation of his companions examination
of the paperweight and set it down again A casual spectator from
the window might have imagined that the two were engaged in an amicable
inventory of the furniture

And theeractual circumstances asked the Colonel

Oh it was fair enough fight THEYLL tell you that And so would HE
I reckonif he could He was ugly and bedevlin but I didnt care to
quoll and give him the goby all the time He kept on followed me out
of the shanty drew and fired twice Ihe stopped and regarded his
hat a moment as if it was a corroborating witnessII closed with
himI had toit was my only chance and that ended itand with his
own revolver I never drew mine

I see said the Colonel nodding clearly justifiable and honorable
as regards the code And you wish me to defend you

The strangers gloomy expression of astonishment now turned to blank
hopelessness

I knew you didnt understand he said despairingly Why all THAT
was TWO YEARS AGO Its all settled and done and gone The jury found
for me at the inquest It aint THAT I want to see you about Its
something arising out of it

Ah said the Colonel affably a vendetta perhaps Some friend or
relation of his taken up the quarrel

The stranger looked abstractedly at Starbottle You think a relation
might or would feel in that sort of way

Why blank it all sir said the Colonel nothing is more common
Why in 52 one of my oldest friends Doctor Byrne of St Jo the
seventh in a line from old General Byrne of St Louis was killed
sir by Pinkey Riggs seventh in a line from Senator Riggs of Kentucky
Original cause sir something about a dd roasting ear or a blank
persimmon in 1832 fortyseven men wiped out in twenty years Fact
sir

It aint that said the stranger moving hesitatingly in his chair
If it was anything of that sort I wouldnt mindit might bring
matters to a windup and I shouldnt have to come here and have this
cursed talk with you

It was so evident that this frank and unaffected expression of some
obscure disgust with his own present position had no other implication
that the Colonel did not except to it Yet the man did not go on He
stopped and seemed lost in sombre contemplation of his hat

The Colonel leaned back in his chair fanned himself elegantly wiped
his forehead with a large pongee handkerchief and looking at his
companion whose shadowed abstraction seemed to render him impervious to
the heat said

My dear Mr Corbin I perfectly understand you Blank it all sir
the temperature in this infernal hole is quite enough to render any
confidential conversation between gentlemen upon delicate matters
utterly impossible Its almost as near Hades sir as they make
itas I trust you and I Mr Corbin will ever experience I propose
continued the Colonel with airy geniality some light change and
refreshment The barkeeper of the Magnolia iserI may say sir
facile princeps in the concoction of mint juleps and there is a back
room where I have occasionally conferred with political leaders at
election time It is but a step sirin fact on Main Streetround the
corner

The stranger looked up and then rose mechanically as the Colonel resumed
his coat and waistcoat but not his collar and cravat which lay limp
and dejected among his papers Then sheltering himself beneath a
largebrimmed Panama hat and hooking his cane on his arm he led the
way fan in hand into the road tiptoeing in his tight polished boots
through the red impalpable dust with his usual jaunty manner yet
not without a profane suggestion of burning ploughshares The stranger
strode in silence by his side in the burning sun impenetrable in his
own morose shadow

But the Magnolia was fragrant like its namesake with mint and herbal
odors cool with sprinkled floors and sparkling with broken ice on
its counters like dewdrops on white unfolded petalsand slightly
soporific with the subdued murmur of droning loungers who were heavy
with its sweets The gallant Colonel nodded with confidential affability
to the spotlessshirted barkeeper and then taking Corbin by the arm
fraternally conducted him into a small apartment in the rear of the
barroom It was evidently used as the office of the proprietor and
contained a plain desk table and chairs At the rear window Nature
not entirely evicted looked in with a few straggling buckeyes and a
dusty myrtle over the body of a latelyfelled pinetree that flaunted
from an upflung branch a still green spray as if it were a drooping
banner lifted by a dead but rigid arm From the adjoining room the
faint monotonous click of billiard balls languidly played came at
intervals like the dry notes of cicale in the bushes

The barkeeper brought two glasses crowned with mint and diademed with
broken ice The Colonel took a long pull at his portion and leaned
back in his chair with a bland gulp of satisfaction and dreamily patient
eyes The stranger mechanically sipped the contents of his glass and
then without having altered his reluctant expression drew from his
breastpocket a number of old letters Holding them displayed in his
fingers like a difficult hand of cards and with something of the air of
a dispirited player he began

You see about six months after this yer trouble I got this letter He
picked out a well worn badly written missive and put it into Colonel
Starbottles hands rising at the same time and leaning over him as he
read You see she that writ it says as how she hadnt heard from her
son for a long time but owing to his having spoken once about ME she
was emboldened to write and ask me if I knew what had gone of him He
was pointing his finger at each line of the letter as he read it or
rather seemed to translate it from memory with a sad familiarity Now
he continued in parenthesis you see this kind o got me I knew he had
got relatives in Kentucky I knew that all this trouble had been put in
the paper with his name and mine but this here name of Martha Jeffcourt
at the bottom didnt seem to jibe with it Then I remembered that he had
left a lot of letters in his trunk in the shanty and I looked em over
And I found that his name WAS Tom Jeffcourt and that hed been passin
under the name of Frisbee all this time

Perfectly natural and a frequent occurrence interposed the Colonel
cheerfully Only last year I met an old friend whom well call Stidger
of New Orleans at the Union Club Frisco How are you Stidger I
said I havent seen you since we used to meetdriving over the Shell
Road in 53 Excuse me sir said he my name is not Stidger its
Brown I looked him in the eye sir and saw him quiver Then I must
apologize to Stidger I said for supposing him capable of changing
his name He came to me an hour after all in a tremble For Gods
sake Star he saidalways called me Stardont go back on me
but you know family affairsanother woman beautiful creature etc
etcyes sir perfectly common but a blank mistake When a man once
funks his own name hell turn tail on anything Sorry for this man
Friezecoat or Turncoat or whatevers his dd name but its so

The suggestion did not however seem to raise the strangers spirits
or alter his manner His name was Jeffcourt and this here was his
mother he went on drearily and you see here she sayspointing
to the letter againshes been expecting money from him and it dont
come and shes mighty hard up And that gave me an idea I dont know
he went on regarding the Colonel with gloomy doubt as youll think it
was much I dont know as you wouldnt call it a dd fool idea but I
got it all the same He stopped hesitated and went on You see this
man Frisbee or Jeffcourt was my pardner We were good friends up to
the killing and then he drove me hard I think I told you he drove me
harddidnt I Well he did But the idea I got was this Considerin
I killed him after all and so to speak disappointed them I reckoned
Id take upon myself the care of that family and send em money every
month

The Colonel slightly straitened his cleanshaven mouth A kind of
expiation or amercement by fine known to the Mosaic Roman and old
English law Gad sir the Jews might have made you MARRY his widow
or sister An old custom and I think supersededsir properly
supersededby the alternative of ordeal by battle in the mediaeval
times I dont myself fancy these pecuniary fashions of settling
wrongsbut go on

I wrote her continued Corbin that her son was dead but that he and
me had some interests together in a claim and that I was very glad to
know where to send her what would be his share every month I thought it
no use to tell her I killed himmay be she might refuse to take it I
sent her a hundred dollars every month since Sometimes its been pretty
hard sleddin to do it for I aint rich sometimes Ive had to borrow
the money but I reckoned that I was only paying for my share in this
here business of his bein dead and I did it

And I understand you that this Jeffcourt really had no interest in your
claim

Corbin looked at him in dull astonishment Not a cent of course I
thought I told you that But that werent his fault for he never
had anything and owed me money In fact he added gloomily it
was because I hadnt any more to give himhavin sold my watch
for grubthat he quolled with me that day and up and called me a
sneakin Yankee hound I told you he drove me hard

The Colonel coughed slightly and resumed his jaunty manner And
theermother was of course grateful and satisfied

Well nonot exactly He stopped again and took up his letters once
more sorted and arranged them as if to play out his unfinished but
hopeless hand and drawing out another laid it before the Colonel You
see this Mrs Jeffcourt after a time reckoned she ought to have MORE
money than I sent her and wrote saying that she had always understood
from her son he that never wrote but once a year remember that this
claim of ours that she never knew of you know was paying much more
than I sent herand she wanted a return of accounts and papers or
shed write to some lawyer mighty quick Well I reckoned that all
this was naturally in the line of my trouble and I DID manage to scrape
together fifty dollars more for two months and sent it But that didnt
seem to satisfy heras you see He dealt Colonel Starbottle another
letter from his baleful hand with an unchanged face When I got
thatwell I just up and told her the whole thing I sent her the
account of the fight from the newspapers and told her as how her son
was the Frisbee that was my pardner and how he never had a cent in the
worldbut how Id got that idea to help her and was willing to carry
it out as long as I could

Did you keep a copy of that letter asked the Colonel straitening his
masklike mouth

No said Corbin moodily What was the good I knowd shed got the
letterand she didfor that is what she wrote back He laid another
letter before the Colonel who hastily read a few lines and then brought
his fat white hand violently on the desk

Why dn it all sir this is BLACKMAIL As infamous a case of
threatening and chantage as I ever heard of

Well said Corbin dejectedly I dont know You see she allows that
I murdered Frisbee to get hold of his claim and that Im trying to buy
her off and that if I dont come down with twenty thousand dollars on
the nail and notes for the rest shell prosecute me Well mebbe the
thing looks to her like thatmebbe you know Ive got to shoulder that
too Perhaps its all in the same line

Colonel Starbottle for a moment regarded Corbin critically In spite of
his chivalrous attitude towards the homicidal faculty the Colonel
was not optimistic in regard to the baser pecuniary interests of his
fellowman It was quite on the cards that his companion might have
murdered his partner to get possession of the claim It was true that
Corbin had voluntarily assumed an unrecorded and hitherto unknown
responsibility that had never been even suspected and was virtually
selfimposed But that might have been the usual one unerring blunder of
criminal sagacity and forethought It was equally true that he did not
look or act like a mean murderer but that was nothing However there
was no evidence of these reflections in the Colonels face Rather he
suddenly beamed with an excess of politeness Would youermind Mr
Corbin whilst I am going over those letters again toerstep across
to my officeanderbring me the copy of Woods Digest that lies on
my table It will save some time

The stranger rose as if the service was part of his selfimposed
trouble and as equally hopeless with the rest and taking his hat
departed to execute the commission As soon as he had left the building
Colonel Starbottle opened the door and mysteriously beckoned the
barkeeper within

Do you remember anything of the killing of a man named Frisbee over in
Fresno three years ago

The barkeeper whistled meditatively Three years
agoFrisbeeFresnono Yesbut that was only one of his names He
was Jack Walker over here Yesand by Jove that feller that was here
with you killed him Darn my skin but I thought I recognized him

Yes yes I know all that said the Colonel impatiently But did
Frisbee have any PROPERTY Did he have any means of his own

Property echoed the barkeeper with scornful incredulity Property
Means The only property and means he ever had was the free lunches or
drinks he took in at somebody elses expense Why the only chance he
ever had of earning a square meal was when that fellow that was with you
just now took him up and made him his partner And the only way HE could
get rid of him was to kill him And I didnt think he had it in him
Rather a queer kind o chapgood deal of hayseed about him Showed up
at the inquest so glum and orkerd that if the boys hadnt made up their
minds this yer Frisbee ORTER BEEN killedit might have gone hard with
him

Mr Corbin said Colonel Starbottle with a pained but unmistakable
hauteur and a singular elevation of his shirt frill as if it had become
of its own accord erectile Mr Corbinereris the distant relative
of old Major Corbin of Nashvilleerone of my oldest political
friends When Mr Corbinerreturns you can conduct him to me And
if you please replenish the glasses

When the barkeeper respectfully showed Mr Corbin and Woods Digest
into the room again the Colonel was still beaming and apologetic

A thousand thanks sir but except to SHOW you the law if you require
ithardly necessary I haveerglanced over the womans letters
again it would be better perhaps if you had kept copies of your
ownbut still these tell the whole story and YOUR OWN The claim
is preposterous You have simply to drop the whole thing Stop your
remittances stop your correspondencepay no heed to any further
letters and wait results You need fear nothing further sir I stake my
professional reputation on it

The gloom of the stranger seemed only to increase as the Colonel reached
his triumphant conclusion

I reckoned youd say that he said slowly but it wont do I shall
go on paying as far as I can Its my trouble and Ill see it through

But my dear sir consider gasped the Colonel You are in the hands
of an infamous harpy who is using her sons blood to extract money
from you You have already paid a dozen times more than the life of
that dd sneak was worth and more than thatthe longer you keep on
paying you are helping to give color to their claim and estopping your
own defense And Gad sir youre making a precedent for this sort of
thing you are offering a premium to widows and orphans A gentleman
wont be able to exchange shots with another without making himself
liable for damages I am willing to admit that your feelingsthough in
my opinionerexaggerateddo you credit but I am satisfied that they
are utterly misunderstoodsir

Not by all of them said Corbin darkly

Eh returned the Colonel quickly

There was another letter here which I didnt particularly point out
to you said Corbin taking up the letters again for I reckoned
it wasnt evidence so to speak being from HIS COUSIN a girland
calculated youd read it when I was out

The Colonel coughed hastily I was in facterjust about to glance
over it when you came in

It was written continued Corbin selecting a letter more bethumbed
than the others after the old woman had threatened me This here young
woman allows that she is sorry that her aunt has to take money of me on
account of her cousin being killed and she is still sorrier that she is
so bitter against me She says she hadnt seen her cousin since he was
a boy and used to play with her and that she finds it hard to believe
that he should ever grow up to change his name and act so as to provoke
anybody to lift a hand against him She says she supposed it must be
something in that dreadful California that alters people and makes
everybody so reckless I reckon her heads level there aint it

There was such a sudden and unexpected lightening of the mans face as
he said it such a momentary relief to his persistent gloom that the
Colonel albeit inwardly dissenting from both letter and comment smiled
condescendingly

Shes no slouch of a scribe neither continued Corbin animatedly
Read that

He handed his companion the letter pointing to a passage with his
finger The Colonel took it with I fear a somewhat lowered opinion of
his client and a new theory of the case It was evident that this weak
submission to the aunts conspiracy was only the result of a greater
weakness for the niece Colonel Starbottle had a wholesome distrust of
the sex as a business or political factor He began to look over the
letter but was evidently slurring it with superficial politeness when
Corbin said

Read it out loud

The Colonel slightly lifted his shoulders fortified himself with
another sip of the julep and leaning back oratorically began to
readthe stranger leaning over him and following line by line with
shining eyes


When I say I am sorry for you it is because I think it must be
dreadful for you to be going round with the blood of a fellowcreature
on your hands It must be awful for you in the stillness of the night
season to hear the voice of the Lord saying Cain where is thy
brother and you saying Lord I have slayed him dead It must be
awful for you when the pride of your wrath was surfitted and his
dum senseless corps was before you not to know that it is written
Vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord    It was no use
for you to say I never heard that before remembering your teacher
and parents Yet verily I say unto you Though your sins be as scarlet
they shall be washed whiter than snow saith the LordIsaiah i 18
and Heart hath no sorrow that Heaven cannot healMy hymn book 1st
Presbyterian Church page 79 Mr Corbin I pity your feelins at the
grave of my pore dear cousin knowing he is before his Maker and you
cant bring him back Umpherervery goodvery good indeed said
the Colonel hastily refolding the letter Very well meaning ander

Go on said Corbin over his shoulder you havent read all

Ah true I perceive I overlooked something Umum May God forgive
you Mr Corbin as I do and make aunty think better of you for it was
good what you tried to do for her and the fammely and Ive always said
it when she was raging round and wanting money of you I dont believe
you meant to do it anyway owin to your kindness of heart to the
ophanless and the widow since you did it Anser this letter and
dont mind what aunty says So no more at present fromYours very
respectfully SALLY DOWS

P STheres been some troubel in our township and some fitin May
the Lord change ther hearts and make them as a little child for if you
are still young you may grow up different I have writ a short prayer
for you to say every night You can coppy it out and put it at the head
of your bed It is this O Lord make me sorry for having killed Sarah
Dows cousin Give me O Lord that peace that the world cannot give
and which fadeth not away for my yoke is heavy and my burden is harder
than I can bear


The Colonels deliberate voice stopped There was a silence in the
room and the air seemed stifling The click of the billiard balls came
distinctly through the partition from the other room Then there was
another click a stamp on the floor and a voice crying coarsely Curse
it allmissed again

To the strangers astonishment the Colonel was on his feet in an
instant gasping with inarticulate rage Flinging the door open he
confronted the startled barkeeper empurpled and stertorous

Blank it all sir do you call this a saloon for gentlemen or a corral
for swearing cattle Or do you mean to say that the conversation of two
gentlemen upon delicate professionalanderdomestic affairsis
to be broken upon by the blank profanity of lowbred hounds over their
picayune gambling Take them my kyard sir choked the Colonel who was
always Southern and dialectic in his excited as in his softest moments
and tell them that Colonel Starbottle will nevah dyarken these doahs
again

Before the astonished barkeeper could reply the Colonel had dashed
back into the room clapped his hat on his head and seized his book
letters and cane Mr Corbin he said with gasping dignity I will
take these papahs and consult them again in my own officewhere if
you will do me the honor sir to call at ten oclock tomorrow I
will give you my opinion He strode out of the saloon beside the half
awestricken halfamused yet all discreetly silent loungers followed
by his wondering but gloomy client At the door they partedthe
Colonel tiptoeing towards his office as if dancing with rage the
stranger darkly plodding through the stifling dust in the opposite
direction with what might have been a faint suggestion to his
counselor that the paths of the homicide did not lie beside the still
cool waters


CHAPTER II


The house of Captain Masterton Dows at Pineville Kentucky was a fine
specimen of Southern classical architecture being an exact copy of
Major Fauquiers house in Virginia which was in turn only a slight
variation from a wellknown statesmans historical villa in Alabama
that everybody knew was designed from a famous Greek temple on the
Piraeus Not but that it shared this resemblance with the County Court
House and the Odd Fellows Hall but the addition of training jessamine
and Cherokee rose to the columns of the portico and over the colonnade
leading to its offices showed a certain domestic distinction And the
sky line of its incongruously high roof was pleasantly broken against
adjacent green pines butternut and darker cypress

A nearer approach showed the stuccoed gatepostswhose red brick
core was revealed through the dropping plasteropening in a wall of
halfrough stone halfwooden palisade equally covered with shining
moss and parasitical vines which hid a tangled garden left to its own
unkempt luxuriance Yet there was a reminiscence of past formality
and even pretentiousness in a wide boxbordered terrace and one or two
stuccoed vases prematurely worn and timestained while several rare
exotics had however thriven so unwisely and well in that stimulating
soil as to lose their exclusive refinement and acquire a certain
temporary vulgarity A few with the not uncommon enthusiasm of aliens
had adopted certain native peculiarities with a zeal that far exceeded
any indigenous performance But dominant through all was the continual
suggestion of precocious fruition and premature decay that lingered like
a sad perfume in the garden but made itself persistent if less poetical
in the house

Here the fluted wooden columns of the portico and colonnade seemed to
have taken upon themselves a sodden and unwholesome age unknown to stone
and mortar Moss and creeper clung to paint that time had neither dried
nor mellowed but left still glairy in its white consistency There were
rusty red blotches around inflamed nailholes in the swollen wood as of
punctures in living flesh along the entablature and cornices and in the
dank gutters decay had taken the form of a mild deliquescence and the
pillars were spotted as if Nature had dropped over the too early ruin
a few unclean tears The house itself was lifted upon a broad wooden
foundation painted to imitate marble with such hopeless mendacity that
the architect at the last moment had added a green border and the owner
permitted a fallen board to remain off so as to allow a few privileged
fowls to openly explore the interior When Miss Sally Dows played the
piano in the drawingroom she was at times accompanied by the uplifted
voice of the sympathetic hounds who sought its quiet retreat in
illhealth or low spirits and from whom she was separated only by
an imperfectly carpeted floor of yawning seams The infant progeny
of Mammy Judy an old nurse made this a hidingplace from domestic
justice where they were eventually betrayed by subterranean giggling
that had once or twice brought bashful confusion to the hearts of Miss
Sallys admirers and mischievous security to that finished coquette
herself

It was a pleasant September afternoon on possibly one of these
occasions that Miss Sally sitting before the piano alternately
striking a few notes with three pink fingers and glancing at her
reflection in the polished rosewood surface of the lifted keyboard case
was heard to utter this languid protest

Quit that kind of talk Chet unless you just admire to have every word
of it repeated all over the county Those little niggers of Mammy Judys
are lying round somewhere and are mighty cute and sassy I tell you
Its nothin to ME sure but Miss Hilda mightnt like to hear of it So
soon after your particular attention to her at last nights pawty too

Here a freshlooking young fellow of sixandtwenty leaning uneasily
over the piano from the opposite side was heard to murmur that he
didnt care what Miss Hilda heard nor the whole world for the matter
of that But he added with a faint smile folks allow that you know
how to PLAY UP sometimes and put on the loud pedal when you dont want
Mammys niggers to hear

Indeed said the young lady demurely Like this

She put out a distracting little foot clothed in the white stocking and
cool black prunella slipper then de rigueur in the State and pressing
it on the pedal began to drum vigorously on the keys In vain the
amorous Chet protested in a voice which the instrument drowned
Perceiving which the artful young lady opened her blue eyes mildly and
said

I reckon it IS so it DOES kind of prevent you hearing what you dont
want to hear

You know well enough what I mean said the youth gloomily And that
aint all that folks say They allow that youre doin a heap too much
correspondence with that Californian rough that killed Tom Jeffcourt
over there

Do they said the young lady with a slight curl of her pretty lip
Then perhaps they allow that if it wasnt for me he wouldnt be sending
a hundred dollars a month to Aunt Martha

Yes said the fatuous youth but they allow he killed Tom for his
money And they do say its mighty queer doins in yo writin religious
letters to him and Tom your own cousin

Oh they tell those lies HERE do they But do they say anything about
how when the same lies were told over in California the lawyer theyve
got over there called Colonel Starbottlea Southern man toogot up
and just wrote to Aunt Martha that shed better quit that afore she got
prosecuted They didnt tell you that did they Mister Chester Brooks

But here the unfortunate Brooks after the fashion of all jealous
lovers deserted his allies for his fair enemy I dont cotton to what
THEY say Sally but you DO write to him and I dont see what youve
got to write aboutyou and him Jule Jeffcourt says that when you got
religion at Louisville during the revival you felt you had a call to
write and save sinners and you did that as your trial and probation
but that since you backslided and are worldly again and go to parties
you just keep it up for foolin and flirtin SHE aint goin to weaken
on the man that shot her brother just because hes got a gold mine
anda mustache

She takes his MONEY all the same said Miss Sally

SHE donther mother does SHE says if she was a man shed have blood
for blood

My said Miss Sally in affected consternation Its a wonder she
dont apply to you to act for her

If it was MY brother he killed Id challenge him quick enough said
Chet flushing through his thin pink skin and light hair

Marry her then and thatll make you one of the family I reckon Miss
Hilda can bear it rejoined the young lady pertly

Look here Miss Sally said the young fellow with a boyish despair
that was not without a certain pathos in its implied inferiority I
aint gifted like youI aint on yo level no how I cant pass yo on
the road and so I reckon I must take yo dust as yo make it But there
is one thing Miss Sally I want to tell you You know whats going on
in this country youve heard your father say what the opinion of the
best men is and whats likely to happen if the Yanks force that nigger
worshiper Lincoln on the South You know that were drawing the line
closer every day and spottin the men that aint sound Take care Miss
Sally you aint sellin us cheap to some Northern Abolitionist
whod like to set Marm Judys little niggers to something worse
than eavesdropping down there and mebbe teach em to kindle a fire
underneath yo own flo

He had become quite dialectic in his appeal as if youthfully reverting
to some accent of the nursery or as if he were exhorting her in some
recognized shibboleth of a section Miss Sally rose and shut down the
piano Then leaning over it on her elbows her rounded little chin
slightly elevated with languid impertinence and one saucy foot kicked
backwards beyond the hem of her white cotton frock she said And let
me tell you Mister Chester Brooks that its just such Godforsaken
infant phenomenons as you who want to run the whole country that make
all this fuss when you aint no more fit to be trusted with matches
than Judys children What do YOU know of Mr Jo Corbin when you dont
even know that hes from Shelbyville and as good a Suthner as you and
if he hasnt got niggers its because they dont use them in his parts
Yor for all the world like one o Mrs Johnsons fancy bantams that
aint quit of the shell afore they square off at their own mother My
goodness Sho Shooo And suiting the action to the word the young
lady still indolently even in her simulation swirled around caught
her skirts at the side with each hand and lazily shaking them before
her in the accepted feminine method of frightening chickens as she
retreated backwards dropped them suddenly in a profound curtsey and
swept out of the parlor

Nevertheless as she entered the sittingroom she paused to listen
then going to the window peeped through the slits of the Venetian
blind and saw her youthful admirer more dejected in the consciousness
of his wasted efforts and useless attire mount his showy young horse
as aimlessly spirited as himself and ride away Miss Sally did not
regret this neither had she been entirely sincere in her defense of her
mysterious correspondent But like many of her sex she was trying to
keep up by the active stimulus of opposition an interest that she had
begun to think if left to itself might wane She was conscious that
her cousin Julia although impertinent and illogical was right in
considering her first epistolary advances to Corbin as a youthful
converts religious zeal But now that her girlish enthusiasm was spent
and the revival itself had proved as fleeting an excitement as the old
Tournament of Love and Beauty which it had supplanted she preferred
to believe that she enjoyed the fascinating impropriety because it was
the actual result of her religious freedom Perhaps she had a vague idea
that Corbins conversion would expiate her present preference for dress
and dancing She had certainly never flirted with him they had never
exchanged photographs there was not a passage in his letters that might
not have been perused by her parentswhich I fear was probably one
reason why she had never shown her correspondence and beyond the fact
that this letterwriting gave her a certain importance in her own
eyes and those of her companions it might really be stopped She even
thought of writing at once to him that her parents objected to its
further continuance but remembering that his usual monthly letter was
now nearly due she concluded to wait until it came

It is to be feared that Miss Sally had little help in the way of family
advice and that the moral administration of the Dows household was as
prematurely developed and as precociously exhausted as the estate and
mansion themselves Captain Dows marriage with Josephine Jeffcourt
the daughter of a poor white had been considered a mesalliance by his
family and his own sister Miranda Dows had abandoned her brothers
roof and refused to associate with the Jeffcourts only returning to
the house and an armed neutrality at the death of Mrs Dows a few years
later She had taken charge of Miss Sally sending her to school at
Nashville until she was recalled by her father two years ago It may be
imagined that Miss Sallys correspondence with Jeffcourts murderer had
afforded her a mixed satisfaction it was at first asserted that Miss
Sallys forgiveness was really prompted by Miss Mirandy as a subtle
sarcasm upon the family When however that forgiveness seemed to
become a source of revenue to the impoverished Jeffcourts her Christian
interference had declined

For this reason possibly the young girl did not seek her aunt in
the bedroom the diningroom or the businessroom where Miss
Miranda frequently assisted Captain Dows in the fatuous and prejudiced
mismanagement of the house and property nor in any of the vacant
guestrooms which in their early wreck of latterday mahogany and
rosewood seemed to have been unoccupied for ages but went directly to
her own room This was in the L a lately added wing that had escaped
the gloomy architectural tyranny of the main building and gave Miss
Sally light ventilation the freshness and spice of new pine boards and
clean paper and a separate entrance and windows on a cool veranda all
to herself Intended as a concession to the young ladys traveled taste
it was really a reversion to the finer simplicity of the pioneer

New as the apartment appeared to be it was old enough to contain
the brief little records of her maidenhood the childish samplers and
pictures the sporting epoch with its foxheads opossum and wildcat
skins ridingwhip and the goshawk in a cage which Miss Sally believed
could be trained as a falcon the religious interval of illustrated
texts Rock of Ages cardboard crosses and the certificate of her
membership with The Daughters of Sion at the head of her little bed
down to the last decadence of frivolity shown in the beribboned guitar
in the corner and the dance cards favors and rosettes military
buttons dried bouquets and other love gages on the mantelpiece

The young girl opened a drawer of her table and took out a small packet
of letters tied up with a green ribbon As she did so she heard the
sound of hoofs in the rear courtyard This was presently followed by
a step on the veranda and she opened the door to her father with the
letters still in her hand There was neither the least embarrassment nor
selfconsciousness in her manner

Captain Dows superficially remarkable only for a certain odd
combination of high military stock and turnedover planters collar was
slightly exalted by a sympathetic mingling of politics and mint julep
at Pineville Court House I was passing by the postoffice at the Cross
Roads last week dear he began cheerfully and I thought of you and
reckoned it was about time that my Pussy got one of her letters from her
rich Californian friendand sure enough there was one I clean forgot
to give it to you then and only remembered it passing there today I
didnt get to see if there was any golddust in it he continued with
great archness and a fatherly pinch of her cheek though I suspect
that isnt the kind of currency he sends to you

It IS from Mr Corbin said Miss Sally taking it with a languid kind
of doubt and only now paw I was just thinking that Id sort of drop
writing any more it makes a good deal of buzzing amongst the neighbors
and I dont see much honey nor comb in it

Eh said the Captain apparently more astonished than delighted at
his daughters prudence Well child suit yourself Its mighty mean
though for I was just thinking of telling you that Judge Read is an
old friend of this Colonel Starbottle who is your friends friend and
lawyer and he says that Colonel Starbottle is WITH US and working
for the cause out there and has got a list of all the Sothern men
in California that are sound and solid for the South Read says he
shouldnt wonder if hed make California wheel into line too

I dont see what thats got to do with Mr Corbin said the young
girl impatiently flicking the still unopened letter against the packet
in her hand

Well said the Captain with cheerful vagueness I thought it might
interest youthats all and lounged judicially away

Paw thinks said Miss Sally still standing in the doorway
ostentatiously addressing her pet goshawk but with one eye following
her retreating parent Paw thinks that everybody is as keen bent on
politics as he is Theres where paw slips up Jim

Reentering the room scratching her little nose thoughtfully with the
edge of Mr Corbins letter she went to the mantelpiece and picked up a
small ivoryhandled dagger the gift of Joyce Masterton aged eighteen
presented with certain verses addressed to a Daughter of the South
and cut open the envelope The first glance was at her own name and
then at the signature There was no change in the formality it was
Dear Miss Sarah and Yours respectfully Jo Corbin as usual She
was still secure But her pretty brows contracted slightly as she read
as follows


Ive always allowed I should feel easier in my mind if I could ever get
to see Mrs Jeffcourt and that may be she might feel easier in hers if
I stood before her face to face Even if she didnt forgive me at once
it might do her good to get off what she had on her mind against me But
as there wasnt any chance of her coming to me and it was out of the
question my coming to her and still keeping up enough work in the mines
to send her the regular money it couldnt be done But at last Ive got
a partner to run the machine when Im away I shall be at Shelbyville by
the time this reaches you where I shall stay a day or two to give you
time to break the news to Mrs Jeffcourt and then come on You will do
this for me in your Christian kindness Miss Dowswont you and if
you could soften her mind so as to make it less hard for me I shall be
grateful

P SI forgot to say I have had HIM exhumedyou know who I meanand
am bringing him with me in a patent metallic burial casketthe best
that could be got in Frisco and will see that he is properly buried
in your own graveyard It seemed to me that it would be the best thing
I could do and might work upon her feelingsas it has on mine Dont
you

J C


Miss Sally felt the tendrils of her fair hair stir with consternation
The letter had arrived a week ago perhaps he was in Pineville at that
very moment She must go at once to the Jeffcourtsit was only a mile
distant Perhaps she might be still in time but even then it was a
terribly short notice for such a meeting Yet she stopped to select her
newest hat from the closet and to tie it with the largest of bows under
her pretty chin and then skipped from the veranda into a green lane
that ran beside the garden boundary There hidden by a hedge she
dropped into a long swinging trot that even in her haste still kept
the languid deliberation characteristic of her people until she had
reached the road Two or three hounds in the garden started joyously
to follow her but she drove them back with a portentous frown and an
illaimed stone and a suppressed voice Yet in that backward glance she
could see that her little EumenidesMammy Judys childrenwere peering
at her from below the wooden floor of the portico which they were
grasping with outstretched arms and bowed shoulders as if they were
black caryatides supportingas indeed their race had done for many a
yearthe predoomed and decaying mansion of their master


CHAPTER III


Happily Miss Sally thought more of her present mission than of the
past errors of her people The faster she walked the more vividly she
pictured the possible complications of this meeting She knew the dull
mean nature of her aunt and the utter hopelessness of all appeal to
anything but her selfish cupidity and saw in this fatuous essay of
Corbin only an aggravation of her worst instincts Even the dead body
of her son would not only whet her appetite for pecuniary vengeance
but give it plausibility in the eyes of their emotional but ignorant
neighbors She had still less to hope from Julia Jeffcourts more honest
and human indignation but equally bigoted and prejudiced intelligence
It is true they were only women and she ought to have no fear of that
physical revenge which Julia had spoken of but she reflected that Miss
Jeffcourts unmistakable beauty and what was believed to be a truly
Southern spirit had gained her many admirers who might easily take
her wrongs upon their shoulders If her father had only given her that
letter before she might have stopped Corbins coming at all she might
even have met him in time to hurry him and her cousins provocative
remains out of the country In the midst of these reflections she had
to pass the little hillside cemetery It was a spot of great natural
beauty cypressshadowed and luxuriant It was justly celebrated in
Pineville and but for its pretentious tombstones might have been
peaceful and suggestive Here she recognized a figure just turning from
its gate It was Julia Jeffcourt

Her first instinctthat she was too late and that her cousin had come
to the cemetery to make some arrangements for the impending burialwas
however quickly dissipated by the young girls manner

Well Sally Dows YOU here whod have thought of seeing you today
Why Chet Brooks allowed that you danced every set last night and
didnt get home till daylight And youyou that are going to show up
at another party tonight too Well I reckon I havent got that much
ambition these times And out with your new bonnet too

There was a slight curl of her handsome lip as she looked at her cousin
She was certainly a more beautiful girl than Miss Sally very tall dark
and luminous of eye with a brunette pallor of complexion suggesting
it was said that remote mixture of blood which was one of the unproven
counts of Miss Mirandas indictment against her family Miss Sally
smiled sweetly behind her big bow If you reckon to tie to everything
that Chet Brooks says youll want lots of string and you wont be safe
then You ought to have heard him run on about this one and that one
and that other one not an hour ago in our parlor I had to pack him
off saying he was even making Judys niggers tired She stopped and
added with polite languor I suppose theres no news up at yo house
either Everythings going on as usualandyou get yo California
draft regularly

A good deal of the white of Julias beautiful eyes showed as she turned
indignantly on the speaker I wish cousin Sally youd just let up
talking to me about that money You know as well as I do that I allowed
to maw I wouldnt take a cent of it from the first I might have had all
the gowns and bonnetswith a look at Miss Sallys bowsI wanted from
her she even offered to take me to St Louis for a rigoutif Id been
willing to take blood money But Id rather stick to this old sleazy
mounin for Tomshe gave a dramatic pluck at her faded black
skirtthan flaunt round in white muslins and China silks at ten
dollars a yard paid for by his murderer

You know blacks yo color alwaystaking in your height and
complexion Jule said Miss Sally demurely yet not without a feminine
consciousness that it really did set off her cousins graceful figure to
perfection But you cant keep up this gait always You know some day
you might come upon this Mr Corbin

Hed better not cross my path she said passionately

Ive heard girls talk like that about a man and then get just green
and yellow after him said Miss Sally critically But goodness me
speaking of meeting people reminds me I clean forgot to stop at the
stage office and see about bringing over the new overseer Lucky I met
you Jule Goodby dear Come in tonight and well all go to the
party together And with a little nod she ran off before her
indignant cousin could frame a suitably crushing reply to her Parthian
insinuation

But at the stage office Miss Sally only wrote a few lines on a card put
it in an envelope which she addressed to Mr Joseph Corbin and then
seating herself with easy carelessness on a long packingbox languidly
summoned the proprietor

Youre always on hand yourself at Kirby station when the kyars come in
to bring passengers to Pineville Mr Sledge

Yes Miss

Yo havent brought any strangers over lately

Well last week Squire Farnham of Green Ridgeif he kin be called a
strangeras used to live in the very house yo father

Yes I know said Miss Sally impatiently but if an ENTIRE stranger
comes to take a seat for Pineville you ask him if thats his name
handing the letter and give it to him if it is AndMr Sledgeits
nobodys business butyours and mine

I understand Miss Sally with a slow paternal tolerating wink
Hell get it and nobody else sure

Thank you I hope Mrs Sledge is getting round again

Powfully Miss Sally

Having thus as she hoped stopped the arrival of the unhappy Corbin
Miss Sally returned home to consider the best means of finally disposing
of him She had insisted upon his stopping at Kirby and holding no
communication with the Jeffcourts until he heard from her and had
strongly pointed out the hopeless infelicity of his plan She dare
not tell her Aunt Miranda knowing that she would be too happy to
precipitate an interview that would terminate disastrously to both
the Jeffcourts and Corbin She might have to take her father into her
confidencea dreadful contingency

She was dressed for the evening party which was provincially early
indeed it was scarcely past nine oclock when she had finished her
toilet when there came a rap at her door It was one of Mammy Judys
children

Dey is a gemplum Miss Sally

Yes yes said Miss Sally impatiently thinking only of her escort
Ill be there in a minute Run away He can wait

And he said I was to guv yo dis yer continued the little negro with
portentous gravity presenting a card

Miss Sally took it with a smile It was a plain card on which was
written with a pencil in a hand she hurriedly recognized Joseph
Corbin

Miss Sallys smile became hysterically rigid and pushing the boy aside
with a little cry she darted along the veranda and entered the parlor
from a side door and vestibule To her momentary relief she saw that her
friends had not yet arrived a single figurea strangersrose as she
entered

Even in her consternation she had time to feel the added shock of
disappointment She had always present in her mind an ideal picture of
this man whom she had never seen or even heard described Joseph
Corbin had been tall dark with flowing hair and long mustache He
had flashing fiery eyes which were capable of being subdued by a
single glance of gentlenessher own He was tempestuous quick and
passionate but in quarrel would be led by a smile He was a combination
of an Italian brigand and a poker player whom she had once met on a
Mississippi steamboat He would wear a broadbrimmed soft hat a red
shirt showing his massive throat and neckand high boots Alas the
man before her was of medium height with light closecut hair hollow
cheeks that seemed to have been lately scraped with a razor and
light gray troubled eyes A suit of cheap black ill fitting hastily
acquired and provincial even for Pineville painfully set off these
imperfections to which a white cravat in a hopelessly tied bow
was superadded A terrible idea that this combination of a country
undertaker and an illpaid circuit preacher on probation was his best
holiday tribute to her and not a funeral offering to Mr Jeffcourt
took possession of her And when with feminine quickness she saw his
eyes wander over her own fine clothes and festal figure and sink again
upon the floor in a kind of hopeless disappointment equal to her
own she felt ready to cry But the more terrible sound of laughter
approaching the house from the garden recalled her Her friends were
coming

For Heavens sake she broke out desperately didnt you get my note
at the station telling you not to come

His face grew darker and then took up its look of hopeless resignation
as if this last misfortune was only an accepted part of his greater
trouble as he sat down again and to Miss Sallys horror listlessly
swung his hat to and fro under his chair

No he said gloomily I didnt go to no station I walked here all
the way from Shelbyville I thought it might seem more like the square
thing to her for me to do I sent HIM by express ahead in the box Its
been at the stage office all day

With a sickening conviction that she had been sitting on her cousins
body while she wrote that illfated card the young girl managed to gasp
out impatiently But you must goyesgo now at once Dont talk now
but go

I didnt come here he said rising with a kind of slow dignity to
interfere with things I didnt kalkilate to see glancing again at her
dress as the voices came nearer and that I aint in touch withbut
to know if you think Id better bring himor

He did not finish the sentence for the door had opened suddenly and
a halfdozen laughing girls and their escorts burst into the room
But among them a little haughty and still irritated from her last
interview was her cousin Julia Jeffcourt erect and beautiful in a
sombre silk

Go repeated Miss Sally in an agonized whisper You must not be
known here

But the attention of Julia had been arrested by her cousins agitation
and her eye fell on Corbin where it was fixed with some fatal
fascination that seemed in turn to enthrall and possess him also To
Miss Sallys infinite dismay the others fell back and allowed these two
black figures to stand out then to move towards each other with the
same terrible magnetism They were so near she could not repeat her
warning to him without the others hearing it And all hope died when
Corbin turning deliberately towards her with a grave gesture in the
direction of Julia said quietly

Interduce me

Miss Sally hesitated and then gasped hastily Miss Jeffcourt

Yer dont say MY name Tell her Im Joseph Corbin of Frisco
California who killed her brother He stopped and turned towards her
I came here to try and fix things againand Ive brought HIM

In the wondering silence that ensued the others smiled vacantly
breathlessly and expectantly until Corbin advanced and held out his
hand when Julia Jeffcourt drawing hers back to her bosom with the
palms outward uttered an inarticulate cry andand spat in his face

With that act she found tonguereviling him the house that harbored
him the insolence that presented him the insult that had been put upon
her Are you men she added passionately who stand here with the
man before you that killed my brother and see him offer me his filthy
villainous handand dare not strike him down

And they dared not Violently blindly stupidly moved though all their
instincts though they gathered hysterically around him there was
something in his dull selfcontainment that was unassailable and awful
For he wiped his face and breast with his handkerchief without a tremor
and turned to them with even a suggestion of relief

Shes right gentlemen he said gravely Shes right It might have
been otherwise I might have allowed that it might be otherwisebut
shes right Im a Sothn man myself gentlemen and I reckon to
understand what she has done I killed the only man that had a right to
stand up for her and she has now to stand up for herself But if she
wantsand you see she allows she wantsto pass that on to some of you
or all of you Im willing As many as you like and in what way
you likeI waive any chyce of weaponIm ready gentlemen I came
herewith HIMfor that purpose

Perhaps it may have been his fateful resignation perhaps it may have
been his exceeding readinessbut there was no response He sat down
again and again swung his hat slowly and gloomily to and fro under his
chair

Ive got him in a box at the stage office he went on apparently to
the carpet I had him dug up that I might bring him here and mebbe
bury some of the trouble and difference along with his friends It
might be he added with a slightly glowering upward glance as to an
overruling but occasionally misdirecting Providenceit might be
from the way things are piling up on me that some one might have rung in
another corpse instead o HIM but so far as I can judge allowin for
the space of time and natral wear and tearits HIM

He rose slowly and moved towards the door in a silence that was as much
the result of some conviction that any violent demonstration against him
would be as grotesque and monstrous as the situation as of anything
he had said Even the flashing indignation of Julia Jeffcourt seemed
to become suddenly as unnatural and incongruous as her brothers chief
mourner himself and although she shrank from his passing figure she
uttered no word Chester Brookss youthful emotions following the
expression of Miss Sallys face lost themselves in a vague hysteric
smile and the other gentlemen looked sheepish Joseph Corbin halted at
the door

Whatever he said turning to the company ye make up your mind to
do about me I reckon yed better do it AFTER the funeral IM always
ready But HE what with being in a box and changing climate had better
go FIRST He paused and with a suggestion of delicacy in the momentary
dropping of his eyelids addedfor REASONS

He passed out through the door on to the portico and thence into the
garden It was noticed at the time that the halfdozen hounds lingering
there rushed after him with their usual noisy demonstrations but that
they as suddenly stopped retreated violently to the security of the
basement and there gave relief to their feelings in a succession of
prolonged howls


CHAPTER IV


It must not be supposed that Miss Sally did not feel some contrition
over the ineffective part she had played in this last episode
But Joseph Corbin had committed the unpardonable sin to a woman of
destroying her own illogical ideas of him which was worse than if he
had affronted the preconceived ideas of others in which case she might
still defend him Then too she was no longer religious and had no
call to act as peacemaker Nevertheless she resented Julia Jeffcourts
insinuations bitterly and the cousins quarrelednot the first time in
their intercourseand it was reserved for the latter to break the news
of Corbins arrival with the body to Mrs Jeffcourt

How this was done and what occurred at that interview has not been
recorded But it was known the next day that while Mrs Jeffcourt
accepted the body at Corbins handsand it is presumed the funeral
expenses alsohe was positively forbidden to appear either at the
services at the house or at the church There had been some wild talk
among the younger and many of the lower members of the community
notably the poor nonslaveholding whites of tarring and feathering
Joseph Corbin and riding him on a rail out of the town on the day
of the funeral as a propitiatory sacrifice to the manes of Thomas
Jeffcourt but it being pointed out by the undertaker that it might
involve some uncertainty in the settlement of his bill together with
some reasonable doubt of the thorough resignation of Corbin whose
previous momentary aberration in that respect they were celebrating the
project was postponed until AFTER THE FUNERAL And here an unlookedfor
incident occurred

There was to be a political meeting at Kirby on that day when certain
distinguished Southern leaders had gathered from the remoter Southern
States At the instigation of Captain Dows it was adjourned at the hour
of the funeral to enable members to attend and it was even rumored
to the great delight of Pineville that a distinguished speaker or two
might come over to improve the occasion with some slight allusion to
the engrossing topic of Southern Rights This combined appeal to
the domestic and political emotions of Pineville was irresistible The
Second Baptist Church was crowded After the religious service there
was a pause and Judge Reed stepping forward amid a breathless silence
said that they were peculiarly honored by the unexpected presence in
their midst of that famous son of the South Colonel Starbottle
who had lately returned to his native soil from his adopted home in
California Every eye was fixed on the distinguished stranger as he
rose

Jaunty and gallant as ever femininely smoothfaced yet polished and
high colored as a youthful mask pectorally expansive and unfolding the
white petals of his waistcoat through the swollen lapels of his coat
like a bursting magnolia bud Colonel Starbottle began The present
associations were he might say singularly hallowed to him not only
was Pinevillea Southern centrethe recognized nursery of Southern
chivalry Southern beauty a stately inclination to the pew in which
Miss Sally and Julia Jeffcourt sat Southern intelligence and Southern
independence but it was the home of the lamented dead who had been
like himself and another he should refer to later an adopted citizen of
the Golden State a seeker of the Golden Fleece a companion of Jason
It was the home fellowcitizens and friends of the sorrowing sister of
the deceased a young lady whom he the speaker had as yet known only
through the chivalrous blazon of her virtues and graces by her attendant
knights a courteous wave towards the gallery where Joyce Masterton
Chester Brooks Calhoun Bungstarter and the embattled youth generally
of Pineville became empurpled and idiotic it was the home of the
afflicted widowed mother also personally unknown to him but with whom
he might say he had hadererprofessional correspondence But it
was not this alone that hallowed the occasion it was a sentiment that
should speak in trumpetlike tones throughout the South in this uprising
of an united section It was the forgetfulness of petty strife of
family feud of personal wrongs in the claims of party It might not be
known that he the speaker was professionally cognizant of one of
these regrettableshould he say accidentsarising from the chivalrous
challenge and equally chivalrous response of two fiery Southern spirits
to which they primarily owe their coming here that day And he should
take it as his duty his solemn duty in that sacred edifice to proclaim
to the world that in his knowledge as a professional manas a man of
honor as a Southerner as a gentleman that theercircumstances
which three years ago led to the early demise of our lamented friend
and brother reflected only the highest credit equally on both of the
parties He said this on his own responsibilityin or out of this
sacred edificeand in or out of that sacred edifice he was personally
responsible and prepared to give the fullest satisfaction for it He
was also aware that it might not be knownor understoodthat since
that boyish episode the survivor had taken the place of the departed
in the bereaved family and ministered to their needs with counsel
andererpecuniary aid and had followed the body afoot across the
continent that it might rest with its kindred dust He was aware that
an unchristianhe would say but for that sacred edificea DASTARDLY
attempt had been made to impugn the survivors motivesto suggest an
unseemly discord between him and the family but he the speaker would
never forget the letter breathing with Christian forgiveness and replete
with angelic simplicity sent by a member of that family to his client
which came under his professional eye here the professional eye for a
moment lingered on the hysteric face of Miss Sally he did not envy the
head or heart of a man who could peruse these linesof which the mere
recollectionererchoked the utterance of even a professional
man likeerhimselfwithout emotion And what my friends and
fellowcitizens suddenly continued the Colonel replacing his white
handkerchief in his coattail was the reason why my client Mr
Joseph Corbinwhose delicacy keeps him from appearing among these
mournerscomes here to bury all differences all animosities all petty
passions Because he is a son of the South because as a son of the
South as the representative and a distant connection I believe of
my old political friend Major Corbin of Nashville he wishes here
and everywhere at this momentous crisis to sink everything in the one
allpervading allabsorbing one and indivisible UNITY of the South in
its resistance to the Northern Usurper That my friends is the great
the solemn the Christian lesson of this most remarkable occasion in my
professional political and social experience

Whatever might have been the calmer opinion there was no doubt that
the gallant Colonel had changed the prevailing illogical emotion of
Pineville by the substitution of another equally illogical and Miss
Sally was not surprised when her father touched by the Colonels
allusion to his daughters epistolary powers insisted upon bringing
Joseph Corbin home with him and offering him the hospitality of the
Dows mansion Although the stranger seemed to yield rather from the fact
that the Dows were relations of the Jeffcourts than from any personal
preference when he was fairly installed in one of the appropriately
gloomy guest chambers Miss Sally set about the delayed work of
reconciliationtheoretically accepted by her father and cynically
tolerated by her Aunt Miranda But here a difficulty arose which she had
not foreseen Although Corbin had evidently forgiven her defection on
that memorable evening he had not apparently got over the revelation of
her giddy worldliness and was resignedly apathetic and distrustful of
her endeavors She was at first amused and then angry And her patience
was exhausted when she discovered that he actually seemed more anxious
to conciliate Julia Jeffcourt than her mother

But she spat in your face she said indignantly

Thats so he replied gloomily but I reckoned you said something in
one of your letters about turning the other cheek when you were smitten
Of course as you dont believe it now he added with his upward
glance I suppose THATS been played on me too

But here Miss Sallys spirit lazily rebelled

Look here Mr Joseph JEREMIAH Corbin she returned with languid
impertinence if instead of cavortin round on yo knees trying to
conciliate an old woman who never had a stroke of luck till you killed
her son and a young girl who wont be above letting on afore you think
it that your conciliatin her means SPARKIN her if instead of that
foolishness youd turn your hand to trying to conciliate the folks here
and keep em from going into that fools act of breaking up these United
States if instead of digging up secondhand corpses thats already been
put out of sight once youd set to work to try and prevent the folks
about here from digging up their old cranks and their old whims and
their old women fancies youd be doing something like a Christian and
a man Whats yo bloodguiltinessId like to knowalongside of the
bloodguiltiness of those fools who are just wild to rush into it led
by such turkeycocks as yo friend Colonel Starbottle And youve been
five years in Californiaa free Stateand thats all yo ve toted out
of ita dead body There now dont sit there and swing yo hat under
that chyar but rouse out and come along with me to the pawty if you can
shake a foot and show Miss Pinkney and the gyrls yo fit for something
mo than to skirmish round as a black japanned spittoon for Julia
Jeffcourt It is not recorded that Corbin accepted this cheerful
invitation but for a few days afterwards he was more darkly observant
of and respectful to Miss Sally Strange indeed if he had not
noticedalthough always in his resigned fashionthe dull green
stagnation of the life around him or when not accepting it as part
of his trouble he had not chafed at the arrested youth and senile
childishness of the people Stranger still if he had not at times been
startled to hear the outgrown superstitions and follies of his youth
voiced again by grownup men and perhaps strangest of all if he had not
vaguely accepted it all as the hereditary curse of that barbarism under
which he himself had survived and suffered

The reconciliation between himself and Mrs Jeffcourt was superficially
effected so far as a daily visit by him to the house indicated it to
the community but it was also known that Julia was invariably absent
on these occasions What happened at those interviews did not transpire
but it may be surmised that Mrs Jeffcourt perhaps recognizing the fact
that Corbin was really giving her all that he had to give or possibly
having some lurking fear of Colonel Starbottle was so far placated as
to exhibit only the average ingratitude of her species towards a regular
benefactor She consented to the erection of a small obelisk over her
sons grave and permitted Corbin to plant a few flowering shrubs
which he daily visited and took care of It is said that on one of these
pilgrimages he encountered Miss Julia apparently on the same errand
who haughtily retired It was further alleged on the authority of one
of Mammy Judys little niggers that those two black mourning figures
had been seen at nightfall sitting opposite to each other at the head
and foot of the grave and glowerin at one another like two hants
But when it was asserted on the same authority that their voices had
been later overheard uplifted in some vehement discussion over the grave
of the impassive dead great curiosity was aroused Being pressed by
the eager Miss Sally to repeat some words or any words he had heard them
say the little witness glibly replied Marse Linkum Lincoln and
The Souf and so for the time shipwrecked his testimony But it was
recalled six months afterwards It was then that a pleasant spring day
brought madness and enthusiasm to a majority of Pineville and bated
breath and awe to a few and it was known with the tidings that the
South had appealed to arms that among those who had first responded to
the call was Joseph Corbin an alleged Union man who had however
volunteered to take that place in her ranks which might HAVE BEEN FILLED
BY THE MAN HE HAD KILLED And then people forgot all about him



A year passed It was the same place the old familiar outlines of home
and garden and landscape But seen now in the choking breathlessness of
haste in the fitful changing flashes of life and motion around it
in intervals of sharp suspense or dazed bewilderment it seemed to be
recognized no longer Men who had known it all their lives hurrying to
the front in compact masses scurrying to the rear in straggling line
or opening their ranks to let artillery gallop by stared at it vaguely
and clattered or scrambled on again The smoke of a masked battery
in the woods struggled and writhed to free itself from the clinging
treetops behind it and sank back into a gray encompassing cloud The
dust thrown up by a column of passing horse poured over the wall in one
long wave and whitened the garden with its ashes Throughout the
dim empty house one no longer heard the sound of cannon only a dull
intermittent concussion was felt silently bringing flakes of plaster
from the walls or sliding fragments of glass from the shattered
windows A shell lifted from the ominous distance hung uncertain in
the air and then descended swiftly through the roof the whole house
dilated with flame for an instant smoke rolled slowly from the windows
and even the desolate chimneys started into a hideous mockery of life
and then all was still again At such awful intervals the sun shone out
brightly touched the green of the still sleeping woods and the red and
white of a flower in the garden and something in a gray uniform writhed
out of the dust of the road staggered to the wall and died

A mile down this road growing more and more obscure with those rising
and falling apparitions or the shapeless and rugged heaps terrible in
their helpless inertia by hedge and fence arose the cemetery hill
Taken and retaken thrice that afternoon the dead above it far
outnumbered the dead below and when at last the tide of battle swept
around its base into the dull reverberating woods and it emerged from
the smoke silenced and abandoned only a few stragglers remained One
of them leaning on his musket was still gloomily facing the woods

Joseph Corbin said a low hurried voice

He started and glanced quickly at the tombs around him Perhaps it was
because he had been thinking of the deadbut the voice sounded like
HIS Yet it was only the SISTER who had glided pale and haggard from
the thicket

They are coming through the woods she said quickly Run or youll
be taken Why do you linger

You know why he said gloomily

Yes but you have done yo duty You have done his work The task is
finished now and yo free

He did not reply but remained gazing at the woods

Joseph she said more gently laying her trembling hand on his arm
Joseph flyandtake me with you For I was wrong and I want you to
forgive me I knew your heart was not in this and I ought not to have
asked you Josephlisten I never wanted to avenge myself nor HIM when
I spat on your face I wanted to avenge myself on HER I hated her
because I thought she wanted to work upon you and use you for herself

Your mother he said looking at her

No she said with widely opened eyes you know who I meanMiss
Sally

He looked at her wonderingly for a moment but quickly bent his
head again in the direction of the road They are coming he said
starting YOU must go This is no place for you Stop its too
late you cannot go now until they have passed Come herecrouch down
hereover this graveso

He almost forced herkneeling downupon the mound below the level of
the shrubs and then ran quickly himself a few paces lower down the
hill to a more exposed position She understood it He wished to attract
attention to himself He was successfula few hurried shots followed
from the road but struck above him

He clambered back quickly to where she was still crouching

They were the vedettes he said but they have fallen back on the
main skirmish line and will be here in force in a moment Gowhile you
can She had not moved He tried to raise herher hat fell offhe
saw blood oozing from where the vedettes bullet that had missed him had
pierced her brain

And yet he saw in that pale dead face only the other face which he
remembered now had been turned like this towards his own It was very
strange And this was the end and this was his expiation He raised his
own face humbly blindly despairingly to the inscrutable sky it looked
back upon him from above as coldly as the dead face had from below

Yet out of this he struck a faint idea that he voiced aloud in nearly
the same words which he had used to Colonel Starbottle only three years
ago It was with his own pistol too he said and took up his musket

He walked deliberately down the hill occasionally trying the stock of
his musket in the loose earth and at last suddenly remained motionless
in the attitude of leaning over it At the same moment there was a
distant shout two thin parallel streams of blue and steel came issuing
through the woods like a river appeared to join tumultuously in the
open before the hill and out of the tumult a mounted officer called
upon him to surrender

He did not reply

Come down from there Johnny Reb I want to speak to you called a
young corporal

He did not move

Its time to go home Johnny

No response

The officer who had been holding down his men with an unsworded but
masterful hand raised it suddenly A dozen shots followed The men
leaped forward and dashing Corbin contemptuously aside streamed up the
hill past him

But he had neither heard nor cared For they found he had already
deliberately transfixed himself through the heart on his own bayonet




THE POSTMISTRESS OF LAUREL RUN


CHAPTER I


The mail stage had just passed Laurel Runso rapidly that the whirling
cloud of dust dragged with it down the steep grade from the summit hung
over the level long after the stage had vanished and then drifting
away slowly sifted a red precipitate over the hot platform of the
Laurel Run postoffice

Out of this cloud presently emerged the neat figure of the postmistress
with the mailbag which had been dexterously flung at her feet from the
top of the passing vehicle A dozen loungers eagerly stretched out their
hands to assist her but the warning Its agin the rules boys for
any but her to touch it from a bystander and a coquettish shake of
the head from the postmistress herselfmuch more effective than any
official interdictwithheld them The bag was not heavyLaurel Run
was too recent a settlement to have attracted much correspondenceand
the young woman having pounced upon her prey with a certain feline
instinct dragged it not without difficulty behind the partitioned
inclosure in the office and locked the door Her pretty face
momentarily visible through the window was slightly flushed with the
exertion and the loose ends of her fair hair wet with perspiration
curled themselves over her forehead into tantalizing little rings But
the window shutter was quickly closed and this momentary but charming
vision withdrawn from the waiting public

Guvment oughter have more sense than to make a woman pick mailbags
outer the road said Jo Simmons sympathetically Taint in her days
work anyhow Guvmont oughter hand em over to her like a lady its
rich enough and ugly enough

Taint Guvment its that stage companys airs and graces
interrupted a newcomer They think it mighty fine to go beltin by
makin everybody take their dust just because STOPPIN aint in their
contract Why if that expressman who chucked down the bag had any
feelins for a ladybut he stopped here at the amused faces of his
auditors

Guess you dont know much o that expressmans feelins stranger
said Simmons grimly Why you oughter see him just nussin that bag
like a baby as he comes tearin down the grade and then rise up and
sorter heave it to Mrs Baker ez if it was a fivedollar bokay His
feelins for her Why hes give himself so dead away to her that were
looking for him to forget what hes doin next and just come sailin
down hisself at her feet

Meanwhile on the other side of the partition Mrs Baker had brushed
the red dust from the padlocked bag and removed what seemed to be a
supplementary package attached to it by a wire Opening it she found
a handsome scentbottle evidently a superadded gift from the devoted
expressman This she put aside with a slight smile and the murmured
word Foolishness But when she had unlocked the bag even its
sacred interior was also profaned by a covert parcel from the adjacent
postmaster at Burnt Ridge containing a gold specimen brooch and some
circus tickets It was laid aside with the other This also was vanity
andpresumablyvexation of spirit

There were seventeen letters in all of which five were for herselfand
yet the proportion was small that morning Two of them were marked
Official Business and were promptly put by with feminine discernment
but in another compartment than that holding the presents Then the
shutter was opened and the task of delivery commenced

It was accompanied with a social peculiarity that had in time become a
habit of Laurel Run As the young woman delivered the letters in turn
to the men who were patiently drawn up in Indian file she made that
simple act a medium of privileged but limited conversation on special or
general topicsgay or serious as the case might be or the temperament
of the man suggested That it was almost always of a complimentary
character on their part may be readily imagined but it was invariably
characterized by an element of refined restraint and whether from some
implied understanding or individual sense of honour it never passed the
bounds of conventionality or a certain delicacy of respect The
delivery was consequently more or less protracted but when each man
had exchanged his three or four minutes conversation with the fair
postmistressa conversation at times impeded by bashfulness or
timidity on his part solely or restricted often to vague smilinghe
resignedly made way for the next It was a formal levee mitigated by
the informality of rustic tact great goodhumor and infinite patience
and would have been amusing had it not always been terribly in earnest
and at times touching For it was peculiar to the place and the epoch
and indeed implied the whole history of Mrs Baker

She was the wife of John Baker foreman of The Last Chance now for
a year lying dead under half a mile of crushed and beatenin tunnel at
Burnt Ridge There had been a sudden outcry from the depths at high
hot noontide one day and John had rushed from his cabinhis young
foolish flirting wife clinging to himto answer that despairing cry of
his imprisoned men There was one exit that he alone knew which might be
yet held open among falling walls and tottering timbers long enough to
set them free For one moment only the strong man hesitated between her
entreating arms and his brothers despairing cry But she rose suddenly
with a pale face and said Go John I will wait for you here He
went the men were freedbut she had waited for him ever since

Yet in the shock of the calamity and in the after struggles of that
poverty which had come to the ruined camp she had scarcely changed But
the men had Although she was to all appearances the same giddy pretty
Betsy Baker who had been so disturbing to the younger members they
seemed to be no longer disturbed by her A certain subdued awe and
respect as if the martyred spirit of John Baker still held his arm
around her appeared to have come upon them all They held their breath
as this pretty woman whose brief mourning had not seemed to affect her
cheerfulness or even playfulness of spirit passed before them But she
stood by her cabin and the campthe only woman in a settlement of forty
menduring the darkest hours of their fortune Helping them to wash and
cook and ministering to their domestic needs the sanctity of her cabin
was however always kept as inviolable as if it had been HIS tomb No
one exactly knew why for it was only a tacit instinct but even one or
two who had not scrupled to pay court to Betsy Baker during John Bakers
life shrank from even a suggestion of familiarity towards the woman who
had said that she would wait for him there

When brighter days came and the settlement had increased by one or two
families and laggard capital had been hurried up to relieve the still
beleaguered and lockedup wealth of Burnt Ridge the needs of the
community and the claims of the widow of John Baker were so well told
in political quarters that the postoffice of Laurel Run was created
expressly for her Every man participated in the building of the pretty
yet substantial edificethe only public building of Laurel Runthat
stood in the dust of the great highway half a mile from the settlement
There she was installed for certain hours of the day for she could not
be prevailed upon to abandon Johns cabin and here with all the added
respect due to a public functionary she was secure in her privacy

But the blind devotion of Laurel Run to John Bakers relict did not stop
here In its zeal to assure the Government authorities of the necessity
for a postoffice and to secure a permanent competency to the
postmistress there was much embarrassing extravagance During the first
week the sale of stamps at Laurel Run postoffice was unprecedented
in the annals of the Department Fancy prices were given for the first
issue then they were bought wildly recklessly unprofitably and
on all occasions Complimentary congratulation at the little window
invariably ended with and a dollars worth of stamps Mrs Baker It
was felt to be supremely delicate to buy only the highest priced stamps
without reference to their adequacy then mere QUANTITY was sought then
outgoing letters were all overpaid and stamped in outrageous proportion
to their weight and even size The imbecility of this and its probable
effect on the reputation of Laurel Run at the General Postoffice being
pointed out by Mrs Baker stamps were adopted as local currency
and even for decorative purposes on mirrors and the walls of cabins
Everybody wrote letters with the result however that those SENT were
ludicrously and suspiciously in excess of those received To obviate
this select parties made forced journeys to Hickory Hill the next
postoffice with letters and circulars addressed to themselves at
Laurel Run How long the extravagance would have continued is not
known but it was not until it was rumored that in consequence of
this excessive flow of business the Department had concluded that a
postMASTER would be better fitted for the place that it abated and a
compromise was effected with the General Office by a permanent salary to
the postmistress

Such was the history of Mrs Baker who had just finished her afternoon
levee nodded a smiling goodby to her last customer and closed her
shutter again Then she took up her own letters but before reading
them glanced with a pretty impatience at the two official envelopes
addressed to herself which she had shelved They were generally a lot
of new rules or notifications or absurd questions which had nothing
to do with Laurel Run and only bothered her and made her head ache
and she had usually referred them to her admiring neighbor at Hickory
Hill for explanation who had generally returned them to her with the
brief indorsement Purp stuff dont bother or Hog wash let it
slide She remembered now that he had not returned the last two With
knitted brows and a slight pout she put aside her private correspondence
and tore open the first one It referred with official curtness to an
unanswered communication of the previous week and was compelled to
remind her of rule 47 Again those horrid rules She opened the other
the frown deepened on her brow and became fixed

It was a summary of certain valuable money letters that had miscarried
on the route and of which they had given her previous information
For a moment her cheeks blazed How dare they what did they mean Her
waybills and register were always right she knew the names of every
man woman and child in her district no such names as those borne by
the missing letters had ever existed at Laurel Run no such addresses
had ever been sent from Laurel Run postoffice It was a mean
insinuation She would send in her resignation at once She would get
the boys to write an insulting letter to Senator SlocumbMrs
Baker had the feminine idea of Government as a purely personal
institutionand she would find out who it was that had put them up to
this prying crawling impudence It was probably that walleyed old
wife of the postmaster at Heavy Tree Crossing who was jealous of her
Remind her of their previous unanswered communication indeed Where
was that communication anyway She remembered she had sent it to her
admirer at Hickory Hill Odd that he hadnt answered it Of course he
knew about this meannesscould he too have dared to suspect her The
thought turned her crimson again He Stanton Green was an old Laurel
Runner a friend of Johns a little triflin and presoomin but
still an old loyal pioneer of the camp Why hadnt he spoke up

There was the soft muffled fall of a horses hoof in the thick dust of
the highway the jingle of dismounting spurs and a firm tread on the
platform No doubt one of the boys returning for a few supplemental
remarks under the feeble pretense of forgotten stamps It had been done
before and she had resented it as cayotin round but now she was
eager to pour out her wrongs to the first comer She had her hand
impulsively on the door of the partition when she stopped with a new
sense of her impaired dignity Could she confess this to her worshipers
But here the door opened in her very face and a stranger entered

He was a man of fifty compactly and strongly built A squarelycut
goatee slightly streaked with gray fell straight from his thinlipped
but handsome mouth his eyes were dark humorous yet searching But the
distinctive quality that struck Mrs Baker was the blending of urban ease
with frontier frankness He was evidently a man who had seen cities and
knew countries as well And while he was dressed with the comfortable
simplicity of a Californian mounted traveler her inexperienced
but feminine eye detected the keynote of his respectability in the
carefullytied bow of his cravat The Sierrean throat was apt to be
open free and unfettered

Goodmorning Mrs Baker he said pleasantly with his hat already in
his hand Im Harry Home of San Francisco As he spoke his eye
swept approvingly over the neat inclosure the primlytied papers and
wellkept pigeonholes the pot of flowers on her desk her chinasilk
mantle and killing little chip hat and ribbons hanging against the
wall thence to her own pink flushed face bright blue eyes tendriled
clinging hair and thenfell upon the leathern mailbag still lying
across the table Here it became fixed on the unfortunate wire of the
amorous expressman that yet remained hanging from the brass wards of the
lock and he reached his hand toward it

But little Mrs Baker was before him and had seized it in her arms She
had been too preoccupied and bewildered to resent his first intrusion
behind the partition but this last familiarity with her sacred official
propertyalbeit emptycapped the climax of her wrongs

How dare you touch it she said indignantly How dare you come in
here Who are you anyway Go outside at once

The stranger fell back with an amused deprecatory gesture and a
long silent laugh Im afraid you dont know me after all he said
pleasantly Im Harry Home the Department Agent from the San Francisco
office My note of advice No 201 with my name on the envelope seems
to have miscarried too

Even in her fright and astonishment it flashed upon Mrs Baker that she
had sent that notice too to Hickory Hill But with it all the feminine
secretive instinct within her was now thoroughly aroused and she kept
silent

I ought to have explained he went on smilingly but you are quite
right Mrs Baker he added nodding towards the bag As far as you
knew I had no business to go near it Glad to see you know how to
defend Uncle Sams property so well I was only a bit puzzled to
know pointing to the wire if that thing was on the bag when it was
delivered to you

Mrs Baker saw no reason to conceal the truth After all this official
was a man like the others and it was just as well that he should
understand her power Its only the expressmans foolishness she
said with a slightly coquettish toss of her head He thinks it smart
to tie some nonsense on that bag with the wire when he flings it down

Mr Home with his eyes on her pretty face seemed to think it a not
inhuman or unpardonable folly As long as he doesnt meddle with
the inside of the bag I suppose you must put up with it he said
laughingly A dreadful recollection that the Hickory Hill postmaster
had used the inside of the bag to convey HIS foolishness came across
her It would never do to confess it now Her face must have shown
some agitation for the official resumed with a halfpaternal
halfreassuring air But enough of this Now Mrs Baker to come to
my business here Briefly then it doesnt concern you in the least
except so far as it may relieve you and some others whom the Department
knows equally well from a certain responsibility and perhaps
anxiety We are pretty well posted down there in all that concerns
Laurel Run and I think with a slight bow weve known all about you
and John Baker My only business here is to take your place tonight
in receiving the Omnibus Way Bag that you know arrives here at 930
doesnt it

Yes sir said Mrs Baker hurriedly but it never has anything for
us exceptshe caught herself up quickly with a stammer as
she remembered the sighing Greens occasional offerings except a
notification from Hickory Hill postoffice It leaves there she went
on with an affectation of precision at half past eight exactly and
its about an hours runseven miles by road

Exactly said Mr Home Well I will receive the bag open it and
dispatch it again You can if you choose take a holiday

But said Mrs Baker as she remembered that Laurel Run always made a
point of attending her evening levee on account of the superior leisure
it offered there are the people who come for letters you know

I thought you said there were no letters at that time said Mr Home
quickly

Nobutbutwith a slight hysterical stammer the boys come all
the same

Oh said Mr Home dryly

AndO LordBut here the spectacle of the possible discomfiture of
Laurel Run at meeting the bearded face of Mr Home instead of her own
smooth cheeks at the window combined with her nervous excitement
overcame her so that throwing her little frilled apron over her head
she gave way to a paroxym of hysterical laughter Mr Home waited with
amused toleration for it to stop and when she had recovered resumed
Now I should like to refer an instant to my first communication to
you Have you got it handy

Mrs Bakers face fell No I sent it over to Mr Green of Hickory
Hill for information

What

Terrified at the sudden seriousness of the mans voice she managed to
gasp out however that after her usual habit she had not opened the
official letters but had sent them to her more experienced colleague
for advice and information that she never could understand them
herselfthey made her head ache and interfered with her other
dutiesbut HE understood them and sent her word what to do
Remembering also his usual style of indorsement she grew red again

And what did he say

Nothing he didnt return them

Naturally said Mr Home with a peculiar expression After a few
moments silent stroking of his beard he suddenly faced the frightened
woman

You oblige me Mrs Baker to speak more frankly to you than I had
intended You haveunwittingly I believegiven information to a man
whom the Government suspects of peculation You have without knowing
it warned the postmaster at Hickory Hill that he is suspected and
as you might have frustrated our plans for tracing a series of
embezzlements to their proper source you will see that you might have
also done great wrong to yourself as his only neighbor and the next
responsible person In plain words we have traced the disappearance of
money letters to a point when it lies between these two offices Now
I have not the least hesitation in telling you that we do not suspect
Laurel Run and never have suspected it Even the result of your
thoughtless act although it warned him confirms our suspicion of his
guilt As to the warning it has failed or he has grown reckless for
another letter has been missed since Tonight however will settle all
doubt in the matter When I open that bag in this office tonight and
do not find a certain decoy letter in it which was last checked at
Heavy Tree Crossing I shall know that it remains in Greens possession
at Hickory Hill

She was sitting back in her chair white and breathless He glanced at
her kindly and then took up his hat Come Mrs Baker dont let this
worry you As I told you at first YOU have nothing to fear Even your
thoughtlessness and ignorance of rules have contributed to show your own
innocence Nobody will ever be the wiser for this we do not advertise
our affairs in the Department Not a soul but yourself knows the real
cause of my visit here I will leave you here alone for a while so as
to divert any suspicion You will come as usual this evening and be
seen by your friends I will only be here when the bag arrives to open
it Goodby Mrs Baker its a nasty bit of business but its all in
the days work Ive seen worse and thank God youre out of it

She heard his footsteps retreat into the outer office and die out of the
platform the jingle of his spurs and the hollow beat of his horses
hoofs that seemed to find a dull echo in her own heart and she was
alone

The room was very hot and very quiet she could hear the warping
and creaking of the shingles under the relaxing of the nearly level
sunbeams The office clock struck seven In the breathless silence that
followed a woodpecker took up his interrupted work on the roof
and seemed to beat out monotonously on her ear the last words of the
stranger Stanton Greena thief Stanton Green one of the boys John
had helped out of the falling tunnel Stanton Green whose old mother in
the States still wrote letters to him at Laurel Run in a few hours
to be a disgraced and ruined man forever She remembered now as a
thoughtless woman remembers tales of his extravagance and fast living
of which she had taken no heed and with a sense of shame of presents
sent her that she now clearly saw must have been far beyond his means
What would the boys say What would John have said Ah what would John
have DONE

She started suddenly to her feet white and cold as on that day that
she had parted from John Baker before the tunnel She put on her hat
and mantle and going to that little iron safe that stood in the corner
unlocked it and took out its entire contents of gold and silver She had
reached the door when another idea seized her and opening her desk she
collected her stamps to the last sheet and hurriedly rolled them up
under her cape Then with a glance at the clock and a rapid survey
of the road from the platform she slipped from it and seemed to be
swallowed up in the waiting woods beyond


CHAPTER II


Once within the friendly shadows of the long belt of pines Mrs Baker
kept them until she had left the limited settlement of Laurel Run far to
the right and came upon an open slope of Burnt Ridge where she knew
Jo Simmons mustang Blue Lightning would be quietly feeding She had
often ridden him before and when she had detached the fiftyfoot reata
from his headstall he permitted her the further recognized familiarity
of twining her fingers in his bluish mane and climbing on his back The
toolshed of Burnt Ridge Tunnel where Jos saddle and bridle always
hung was but a canter farther on She reached it unperceived
andanother trick of the old daysquickly extemporized a sidesaddle
from Simmons Mexican tree with its high cantle and horn bow and the
aid of a blanket Then leaping to her seat she rapidly threw off her
mantle tied it by its sleeves around her waist tucked it under
one knee and let it fall over her horses flanks By this time Blue
Lightning was also struck with a flash of equine recollection and
pricked up his ears Mrs Baker uttered a little chirping cry which he
remembered and the next moment they were both careering over the Ridge

The trail that she had taken though precipitate difficult and
dangerous in places was a clear gain of two miles on the stage road
There was less chance of her being followed or meeting any one The
greater canyons were already in shadow the pines on the farther ridges
were separating their masses and showing individual silhouettes against
the sky but the air was still warm and the cool breath of night as
she well knew it had not yet begun to flow down the mountain The lower
range of Burnt Ridge was still uneclipsed by the creeping shadow of
the mountain ahead of her Without a watch but with this familiar
and slowly changing dial spread out before her she knew the time to a
minute Heavy Tree Hill a lesser height in the distance was already
wiped out by that shadowy index fingerhalf past seven The stage would
be at Hickory Hill just before half past eight she ought to anticipate
it if possibleit would stay ten minutes to change horsesshe MUST
arrive before it left

There was a good twomile level before the rise of the next range Now
Blue Lightning all you know And that was muchfor with the little
chip hat and fluttering ribbons well bent down over the bluish mane and
the streaming gauze of her mantle almost level with the horses back
she swept down across the long tableland like a skimming bluejay A few
more birdlike dips up and down the undulations and then came the long
cruel ascent of the Divide

Acrid with perspiration caking with dust slithering in the slippery
impalpable powder of the road groggily staggering in a red dusty dream
coughing snorting headtossing becoming suddenly dejected with
slouching haunch and limp legs on easy slopes or wildly spasmodic
and agile on sharp acclivities Blue Lightning began to have ideas and
recollections Ah she was a devil for a larkthis lightlyclinging
caressing blarneying cooing creatureup there He remembered her now
Ha very well then Hoopla And suddenly leaping out like a rabbit
bucking trotting hard ambling lightly loping on three legs and
recreating himselfas only a California mustang couldthe invincible
Blue Lightning at last stood triumphantly upon the summit The evening
star had just pricked itself through the golden mist of the horizon
lineeight oclock She could do it now But here suddenly her first
hesitation seized her She knew her horse she knew the trail she knew
herselfbut did she know THE MAN to whom she was riding A cold chill
crept over her and then she shivered in a sudden blast it was Night at
last swooping down from the now invisible Sierras and possessing all it
touched But it was only one long descent to Hickory Hill now and she
swept down securely on its wings Halfpast eight The lights of the
settlement were just ahead of herbut so too were the two lamps of
the waiting stage before the postoffice and hotel

Happily the lounging crowd were gathered around the hotel and she
slipped into the postoffice from the rear unperceived As she stepped
behind the partition its only occupanta goodlooking young fellow
with a reddish mustacheturned towards her with a flush of delighted
surprise But it changed at the sight of the white determined face
and the brilliant eyes that had never looked once towards him but were
fixed upon a large bag whose yawning mouth was still open and propped
up beside his desk

Where is the through money letter that came in that bag she said
quickly

Whatdoyoumean he stammered with a face that had suddenly grown
whiter than her own

I mean that its a DECOY checked at Heavy Tree Crossing and that Mr
Home of San Francisco is now waiting at my office to know if you have
taken it

The laugh and lie that he had at first tried to summon to mouth and lips
never reached them For under the spell of her rigid truthful face he
turned almost mechanically to his desk and took out a package

Good God youve opened it already she cried pointing to the broken
seal

The expression on her face more than anything she had said convinced
him that she knew all He stammered under the new alarm that her
despairing tone suggested YesI was owing some billsthe collector
was waiting here for the money and I took something from the packet
But I was going to make it up by next mailI swear it

How much have you taken

Only a trifle I

How much

A hundred dollars

She dragged the money she had brought from Laurel Run from her pocket
and counting out the sum replaced it in the open package He ran
quickly to get the sealing wax but she motioned him away as she dropped
the package back into the mailbag No as long as the money is found
in the bag the package may have been broken ACCIDENTALLY Now burst open
one or two of those other packages a littleso she took out a packet
of letters and bruised their official wrappings under her little foot
until the tape fastening was loosened Now give me something heavy
She caught up a brass twopound weight and in the same feverish
but collected haste wrapped it in paper sealed it stamped it and
addressing it in a large printed hand to herself at Laurel Hill dropped
it in the bag Then she closed it and locked it he would have assisted
her but she again waved him away Send for the expressman and keep
yourself out of the way for a moment she said curtly

An attitude of weak admiration and foolish passion had taken the place
of his former tremulous fear He obeyed excitedly but without a word
Mrs Baker wiped her moist forehead and parched lips and shook out
her skirt Well might the young expressman start at the unexpected
revelation of those sparkling eyes and that demurely smiling mouth at
the little window

Mrs Baker

She put her finger quickly to her lips and threw a world of unutterable
and enigmatical meaning into her mischievous face

Theres a big San Francisco swell takin my place at Laurel tonight
Charley

Yes maam

And its a pity that the Omnibus Way Bag happened to get such a shaking
up and banging round already coming here

Eh

I say continued Mrs Baker with great gravity and dancing eyes
that it would be just AWFUL if that keerful city clerk found things
kinder mixed up inside when he comes to open it I wouldnt give him
trouble for the world Charley

No maam it aint like you

So youll be particularly careful on MY account

Mrs Baker said Charley with infinite gravity if that bag SHOULD
TUMBLE OFF A DOZEN TIMES between this and Laurel Hill Ill hop down and
pick it up myself

Thank you shake

They shook hands gravely across the windowledge

And you aint going down with us Mrs Baker

Of course not it wouldnt dofor I AINT HEREdont you see

Of course

She handed him the bag through the door He took it carefully but in
spite of his great precaution fell over it twice on his way to the
road where from certain exclamations and shouts it seemed that a like
miserable mischance attended its elevation to the boot Then Mrs Baker
came back into the office and as the wheels rolled away threw herself
into a chair and inconsistently gave way for the first time to an
outburst of tears Then her hand was grasped suddenly and she found
Green on his knees before her She started to her feet

Dont move he said with weak hysteric passion but listen to me
for Gods sake I am ruined I know even though you have just saved me
from detection and disgrace I have been mada fool to do what I have
done I know but you do not know allyou do not know why I did ityou
cannot think of the temptation that has driven me to it Listen Mrs
Baker I have been striving to get money honestly dishonestlyany
way to look well in YOUR eyesto make myself worthy of youto make
myself rich and to be able to offer you a home and take you away from
Laurel Run It was all for YOU it was all for love of YOU Betsy my
darling Listen to me

In the fury outraged sensibility indignation and infinite disgust
that filled her little body at that moment she should have been large
imperious goddesslike and commanding But God is at times ironical
with suffering womanhood She could only writhe her hand from his grasp
with childish contortions she could only glare at him with eyes that
were prettily and piquantly brilliant she could only slap at his
detaining hand with a plump and velvety palm and when she found her
voice it was high falsetto And all she could say was Leave me be
looney or Ill scream

He rose with a weak confused laugh half of miserable affectation and
half of real anger and shame

What did you come riding over here for then What did you take all
this risk for Why did you rush over here to share my disgracefor YOU
are as much mixed up with this now as I amif you didnt calculate to
share EVERYTHING ELSE with me What did you come here for then if not
for ME

What did I come here for said Mrs Baker with every drop of red
blood gone from her cheek and trembling lip WhatdidIcome here
for WellI came here for JOHN BAKERS sake John Baker who stood
between you and death at Burnt Ridge as I stand between you and
damnation at Laurel Run Mr Green Yes John Baker lying under half of
Burnt Ridge but more to me this day than any living man crawling over
itininoh fatal climaxin a month o Sundays What did I come
here for I came here as John Bakers livin wife to carry on dead John
Bakers work Yes dirty work this time may be Mr Green but his work
and for HIM onlyprecious Thats what I came here for thats what
I LIVE for thats what Im waiting forto be up to HIM and his work
always Thats meBetsy Baker

She walked up and down rapidly tying her chip hat under her chin again
Then she stopped and taking her chamois purse from her pocket laid it
sharply on the desk

Stanton Green dont be a fool Rise up out of this and be a man
again Take enough out o that bag to pay what you owe Govment send
in your resignation and keep the rest to start you in an honest life
elsewhere But light out o Hickory Hill afore this time tomorrow

She pulled her mantle from the wall and opened the door

You are going he said bitterly

Yes Either she could not hold seriousness long in her capricious
little fancy or with feminine tact she sought to make the parting
less difficult for him for she broke into a dazzling smile Yes Im
goin to run Blue Lightning agin Charley and that way bag back to Laurel
Run and break the record



It is said that she did Perhaps owing to the fact that the grade of the
return journey to Laurel Run was in her favor and that she could avoid
the long circuitous ascent to the summit taken by the stage or that
owing to the extraordinary difficulties in the carriage of the way
bagwhich had to be twice rescued from under the wheels of the
stageshe entered the Laurel Run postoffice as the coach leaders came
trotting up the hill Mr Home was already on the platform

Youll have to ballast your next way bag boss said Charley gravely
as it escaped his clutches once more in the dust of the road or youll
have to make a new contract with the company Weve lost ten minutes in
five miles over that bucking thing

Home did not reply but quickly dragged his prize into the office
scarcely noticing Mrs Baker who stood beside him pale and breathless
As the bolt of the bag was drawn revealing its chaotic interior Mrs
Baker gave a little sigh Home glanced quickly at her emptied the bag
upon the floor and picked up the broken and halffilled money parcel
Then he collected the scattered coins and counted them Its all right
Mrs Baker he said gravely HES safe this time

Im so glad said little Mrs Baker with a hypocritical gasp

So am I returned Home with increasing gravity as he took the coin
for from all I have gathered this afternoon it seems he was an old
pioneer of Laurel Run a friend of your husbands and I think more
fool than knave He was silent for a moment clicking the coins against
each other then he said carelessly Did he get quite away Mrs
Baker

Im sure I dont know what youre talking about said Mrs Baker with
a lofty air of dignity but a somewhat debasing color I dont see why
I should know anything about it or why he should go away at all

Well said Mr Home laying his hand gently on the widows shoulder
well you see it might have occurred to his friends that the COINS
WERE MARKED That is no doubt the reason why he would take their good
advice and go But as I said before Mrs Baker YOURE all right
whatever happensthe Government stands by YOU




A NIGHT AT HAYS


CHAPTER I


It was difficult to say if Hays farmhouse or Hays as it was
familiarly called looked any more bleak and cheerless that winter
afternoon than it usually did in the strong summer sunshine Painted
a cold merciless white with scant projections for shadows a roof of
whitepine shingles bleached lighter through sun and wind and covered
with low whitecapped chimneys it looked even more stark and chilly
than the drifts which had climbed its low roadside fence and yet seemed
hopeless of gaining a foothold on the glancing walls or slippery
windswept roof The storm which had already heaped the hollows of
the road with snow hurled its finelygranulated flakes against the
building but they were whirled along the gutters and ridges and
disappeared in smokelike puffs across the icy roof The granite outcrop
in the hilly field beyond had long ago whitened and vanished the dwarf
firs and larches which had at first taken uncouth shapes in the drift
blended vaguely together and then merged into an unbroken formless
wave But the gaunt angles and rigid outlines of the building remained
sharp and unchanged It would seem as if the rigors of winter had only
accented their hardness as the fierceness of summer had previously made
them intolerable

It was believed that some of this unyielding grimness attached to Hays
himself Certain it is that neither hardship nor prosperity had touched
his character Years ago his emigrant team had broken down in this wild
but wooded defile of the Sierras and he had been forced to a winter
encampment with only a rude logcabin for shelter on the very verge of
the promised land Unable to enter it himself he was nevertheless able
to assist the betterequipped teams that followed him with wood and
water and a coarse forage gathered from a sheltered slope of wild oats
This was the beginning of a rude supply station which afterwards
became so profitable that when spring came and Hays team were
sufficiently recruited to follow the flood of immigrating goldseekers
to the placers and valleys there seemed no occasion for it His fortune
had been already found in the belt of arable slope behind the wooded
defile and in the miraculously located coign of vantage on what was now
the great highway of travel and the only oasis and first relief of the
weary journey the breaking down of his own team at that spot had
not only been the salvation of those who found at Hays the means of
prosecuting the last part of their pilgrimage but later provided the
equipment of returning teams

The first two years of this experience had not been without hardship and
danger He had been raided by Indians and besieged for three days in his
stockaded cabin he had been invested by wintry drifts of twenty feet of
snow cut off equally from incoming teams from the pass and the
valley below During the second year his wife had joined him with four
children but whether the enforced separation had dulled her conjugal
affection or whether she was tempted by a natural feminine longing for
the land of promise beyond she sought it one morning with a fascinating
teamster leaving her two sons and two daughters behind her two years
later the elder of the daughters followed the mothers example with
such maidenly discretion however as to forbear compromising herself by
any previous matrimonial formality whatever From that day Hays had no
further personal intercourse with the valley below He put up a hotel
a mile away from the farmhouse that he might not have to dispense
hospitality to his customers nor accept their near companionship
Always a severe Presbyterian and an uncompromising deacon of a
farscattered and scanty community who occasionally held their service
in one of his barns he grew more rigid sectarian and narrow day
by day He was feared and although neither respected nor loved his
domination and endurance were accepted A grim landlord hard creditor
closefisted patron and a smileless neighbor who neither gambled nor
drank Old Hays as he was called while yet scarce fifty had few
acquaintances and fewer friends There were those who believed that his
domestic infelicities were the result of his unsympathetic nature it
never occurred to any one but himself probably that they might have
been the cause In those Sierran altitudes as elsewhere the belief
in original sinpopularly known as pure cussednessdominated and
overbore any consideration of passive impelling circumstances or
temptation unless they had been actively demonstrated with a revolver
The passive expression of harshness suspicion distrust and moroseness
was looked upon as inherent wickedness

The storm raged violently as Hays emerged from the last of a long range
of outbuildings and sheds and crossed the open space between him and
the farmhouse Before he had reached the porch with its scant shelter
he had floundered through a snowdrift and faced the full fury of the
storm But the snow seemed to have glanced from his hard angular figure
as it had from his roofridge for when he entered the narrow hallway
his pilot jacket was unmarked except where a narrow line of powdered
flakes outlined the seams as if worn To the right was an apartment
half office half sittingroom furnished with a dark and chilly iron
safe a sofa and chairs covered with black and coldly shining horsehair
Here Hays not only removed his upper coat but his under one also and
drawing a chair before the fire sat down in his shirtsleeves It was
his usual rustic pioneer habit and might have been some lingering
reminiscence of certain remote ancestors to whom clothes were an
impediment He was warming his hands and placidly ignoring his gaunt
arms in their thinlyclad hickory sleeves when a young girl of
eighteen sauntered half perfunctorily half inquisitively into
the room It was his only remaining daughter Already elected by
circumstances to a dry household virginity her somewhat large features
sallow complexion and tasteless unattractive dress did not obviously
suggest a sacrifice Since her sisters departure she had taken sole
charge of her fathers domestic affairs and the few rude servants
he employed with a certain inherited following of his own moods and
methods To the neighbors she was known as Miss Haysa dubious
respect that in a community of familiar Sallies Mamies Pussies
was grimly prophetic Yet she rejoiced in the Oriental appellation
of Zuleika To this it is needless to add that it was impossible to
conceive any one who looked more decidedly Western

Ye kin put some things in my carpet bag agin the time the sled comes
round said her father meditatively without looking up

Then youre not coming back tonight asked the girl curiously Whats
goin on at the summit father

I am he said grimly You dont reckon I kalkilate to stop thar
Im going on as far as Horseleys to close up that contract afore the
weather changes

I kinder allowed it was funny youd go to the hotel tonight Theres
a dance there those two Wetherbee girls and Mamie Harris passed up the
road an hour ago on a woodsled nigh blown to pieces and sittin up in
the snow like skeert white rabbits

Hays brow darkened heavily

Let em go he said in a hard voice that the fire did not seem to
have softened Let em go for all the good their foolparents will ever
get outer them or the herd of wayside cattle theyve let them loose
among

I reckon they havent much to do at home or are hard put for company
to travel six miles in the snow to show off their prinkin to a lot of
idle louts shiny with bears grease and scented up with doctors stuff
added the girl shrugging her shoulders with a touch of her fathers
mood and manner

Perhaps it struck Hays at that moment that her attitude was somewhat
monstrous and unnatural for one still young and presumably like other
girls for after glancing at her under his heavy brows he said in a
gentler tone

Never YOU mind Zuly When your brother Jack comes home hell know
whats what and have all the proper New York ways and style Its nigh
on three years now that hes had the best training Dr Dawsons Academy
could givesayin nothing of the powful Christian example of one
of the best preachers in the States They maynt have worldly ungodly
fandangoes where he is and riotous livin and scarlet abominations
but Ive been told that theyve tea circles and assemblies and
harmony concerts of young folksand dancinyes fine square dancin
under control No I aint stinted him in anythin You kin remember
that Zuleika when you hear any more gossip and backbitin about your
fathers meanness I aint spared no money for him

I reckon not said the girl a little sharply Why theres that
draft fur two hundred and fifty dollars that kem only last week from the
Doctors fur extras

Yes replied Hays with a slight knitting of the brows the Doctor
mout hev writ more particklers but parsons aint allus business men
I reckon these here extrys were to push Jack along in the term as the
Doctor knew I wanted him back here in the spring now that his brother
has got to be too stiffnecked and selfopinionated to do his fathers
work It seemed from this that there had been a quarrel between Hays
and his eldest son who conducted his branch business at Sacramento and
who had in a passion threatened to set up a rival establishment to his
fathers And it was also evident from the manner of the girl that she
was by no means a strong partisan of her father in the quarrel

Youd better find out first how all the schoolin and trainin of
Jacks is goin to jibe with the Ranch and if he aint been eddicated
out of all knowledge of station business or keer for it New York aint
Hays Ranch and these yer assemblies and harmony doins and their
airs and graces may put him out of conceit with our plain ways I reckon
ye didnt take that to mind when youve been hustlin round payin two
hundred and fifty dollar drafts for Jack and quollin with Bijah I
aint sayin nothin father only mebbe if Bijah had had drafts and
extrys flourished around him a little more mebbe hed have been more
polite and not so rough spoken Mebbe she continued with a little
laugh even ID be a little more in the style to suit Master Jack when
he comes ef I had three hundred dollars worth of convent schoolin like
Mamie Harris

Yes and youd have only made yourself fair game for evry schemin
lazy sport or counterjumper along the road from this to Sacramento
responded Hays savagely

Zuleika laughed again constrainedly but in a way that might have
suggested that this dreadful contingency was still one that it was
possible to contemplate without entire consternation As she moved
slowly towards the door she stopped with her hand on the lock and said
tentatively I reckon you wont be wantin any supper before you go
Youre almost sure to be offered suthin up at Horseleys while if I
have to cook you up suthin now and still have the mens regular supper
to get at seven it makes all the expense of an extra meal

Hays hesitated He would have preferred his supper now and had his
daughter pressed him would have accepted it But economy which was
one of Zuleikas inherited instincts vaguely appearing to him to be a
virtue interchangeable with chastity and abstemiousness was certainly
to be encouraged in a young girl It hardly seems possible that with an
eye single to the integrity of the larder she could ever look kindly on
the blandishments of his sex or indeed be exposed to them He said
simply Dont cook for me and resumed his attitude before the fire as
the girl left the room

As he sat there grim and immovable as one of the battered firedogs
before him the wind in the chimney seemed to carry on a deepthroated
dejected and confidential conversation with him but really had very
little to reveal There were no haunting reminiscences of his married
life in this room which he had always occupied in preference to the
company or sittingroom beyond There were no familiar shadows of the
past lurking in its corners to pervade his reverie When he did reflect
which was seldom there was always in his mind a vague idea of a central
injustice to which he had been subjected that was to be avoided by
circuitous movement to be hidden by work but never to be surmounted
And tonight he was going out in the storm which he could understand
and fight as he had often done before and he was going to drive a
bargain with a man like himself and get the better of him if he could
as he had done before and another day would be gone and that central
injustice which he could not understand would be circumvented and he
would still be holding his own in the world And the God of Israel
whom he believed in and who was a hard but conscientious Providence
something like himself would assist him perhaps some day to the
understanding of this same vague injustice which He was for some
strange reason permitting But never more unrelenting and unsparing of
others than when under conviction of Sin himself and never more harsh
and unforgiving than when fresh from the contemplation of the Divine
Mercy he still sat there grimly holding his hand to a warmth that never
seemed to get nearer his heart than that when his daughter reentered
the room with his carpetbag

To rise put on his coat and overcoat secure a fur cap on his head by a
woolen comforter covering his ears and twined round his throat and to
rigidly offer a square and weatherbeaten cheek to his daughters dusty
kiss did not apparently suggest any lingering or hesitation The sled
was at the door which for a tumultuous moment opened on the storm and
the white vision of a horse kneedeep in a drift and then closed behind
him Zuleika shot the bolt brushed some flakes of the invading snow
from the mat and after frugally raking down the fire on the hearth her
father had just quitted retired through the long passage to the kitchen
and her domestic supervision

It was a few hours later supper had long past the hands had one by
one returned to their quarters under the roof or in the adjacent lofts
and Zuleika and the two maids had at last abandoned the kitchen for
their bedrooms beyond Zuleika herself by the light of a solitary
candle had entered the office and had dropped meditatively into a
chair as she slowly raked the warm ashes over the still smouldering
fire The barking of dogs had momentarily attracted her attention but
it had suddenly ceased It was followed however by a more startling
incidenta slight movement outside and an attempt to raise the
window

She was not frightened perhaps there was little for her to fear it was
known that Hays kept no money in the house the safe was only used for
securities and contracts and there were half a dozen men within call
It was therefore only her usual active burning curiosity for novel
incident that made her run to the window and peer out but it was with a
spontaneous cry of astonishment she turned and darted to the front door
and opened it to the muffled figure of a young man

Jack Saints alive Why of all things she gasped incoherently

He stopped her with an impatient gesture and a hand that prevented her
from closing the door again

Dad aint here he asked quickly

No

Whenll he be back

Not tonight

Good he said turning to the door again She could see a motionless
horse and sleigh in the road with a woman holding the reins

He beckoned to the woman who drove to the door and jumped out Tall
handsome and audacious she looked at Zuleika with a quick laugh of
confidence as at some recognized absurdity

Go in there said the young man opening the door of the office Ill
come back in a minute

As she entered still smiling as if taking part in some humorous but
risky situation he turned quickly to Zuleika and said in a low voice
Where can we talk

The girl held out her hand and glided hurriedly through the passage
until she reached a door which she opened By the light of a dying fire
he could see it was her bedroom Lighting a candle on the mantel she
looked eagerly in his face as he threw aside his muffler and opened his
coat It disclosed a spare youthful figure and a thin weak face
that a budding mustache only seemed to make still more immature For
an instant brother and sister gazed at each other Astonishment on her
part nervous impatience on his apparently repressed any demonstration
of family affection Yet when she was about to speak he stopped her
roughly

There now dont talk I know what youre goin to saycould say it
myself if I wanted toand its no use Well then here I am You saw
HER Well shes MY WIFEweve been married three months Yes my WIFE
married three months ago Im here because I ran away from schoolthat
is I HAVENT BEEN THERE for the last three months I came out with
her last steamer we went up to the Summit Hotel last nightwhere they
didnt know meuntil we could see how the land lay before popping down
on dad I happened to learn that he was out tonight and I brought
her down here to have a talk We can go back again before he comes you
know unless

But interrupted the girl with sudden practicality you say you
aint been at Doctor Dawsons for three months Why only last week he
drew on dad for two hundred and fifty dollars for your extras

He glanced around him and then arranged his necktie in the glass above
the mantel with a nervous laugh

OH THAT I fixed that up and got the money for it in New York to pay
our passage with Its all right you know


CHAPTER II


The girl stood looking at the ingenious forger with an odd breathless
smile It was difficult to determine however if gratified curiosity
were not its most dominant expression

And youve got a wifeand THATS her she resumed

Yes

Where did you first meet her Who is she

Shes an actressmighty popular in FriscoI mean New York Lot o
chaps tried to get herI cut em out For all dads trying to keep me
at DawsonsI aint such a fool eh

Nevertheless as he stood there stroking his fair mustache his
astuteness did not seem to impress his sister to enthusiastic assent
Yet she did not relax her breathless inquisitive smile as she went
on

And what are you going to do about dad

He turned upon her querulously

Well thats what I want to talk about

Youll catch it she said impressively But here her brothers
nervousness broke out into a weak impotent fury It was evident too
that in spite of its apparent spontaneous irritation its intent was
studied Catch it Would he Oh yes Well shed see WHOD catch it
Not him No hed had enough of this meanness and wanted it ended He
wasnt a woman to be treated like his sisterlike their motherlike
their brother if it came to that for he knew how he was to be brought
back to take Bijahs place in the spring hed heard the whole story
No he was going to stand up for his rightshe was going to be treated
as the son of a man who was worth half a million ought to be treated He
wasnt going to be skimped while his father was wallowing in money that
he didnt know what to do withmoney that by rights ought to have
been given to their mother and their sister Why even the law wouldnt
permit such meannessif he was dead No hed come back with Lottie
his wife to show his father that there was one of the family that
couldnt be fooled and bullied and wouldnt put up with it any longer
There was going to be a fair division of the property and his sister
Annies property and hersZuleikastoo if shed have the pluck to
speak up for herself All this and much more he said Yet even while
his small fury was genuine and characteristic there was such an evident
incongruity between himself and his speech that it seemed to fit
him loosely and in a measure flapped in his gestures like anothers
garment Zuleika who had exhibited neither disgust nor sympathy with
his rebellion but had rather appeared to enjoy it as a novel domestic
performance the morality of which devolved solely upon the performer
retained her curious smile And then a knock at the door startled them

It was the strangerslightly apologetic and still humorous but firm
and selfconfident withal She was sorry to interrupt their family
council but the fire was going out where she sat and she would like
a cup of tea or some refreshment She did not look at Jack but
completely ignoring him addressed herself to Zuleika with what seemed
to be a direct challenge in that feminine eyegrapple there was a
quick instinctive and final struggle between the two women The
stranger triumphed Zuleikas vacant smile changed to one of submission
and then equally ignoring her brother in this double defeat she
hastened to the kitchen to do the visitors bidding The woman closed
the door behind her and took Zuleikas place before the fire

Well she said in a halfcontemptuous toleration

Well said Jack in an equally illdisguised discontent but an
evident desire to placate the woman before him Its all right you
know Ive had my say Itll come right Lottie youll see

The woman smiled again and glanced around the bare walls of the room

And I suppose she said drily when it comes right Im to take the
place of your sister in the charge of this workhouse and succeed to the
keys of that safe in the other room

Itll come all right I tell you you can fix things up here any way
youll like when we get the old man straight said Jack with the
iteration of feebleness And as to that safe Ive seen it chock full
of securities

Itll hold one less tonight she said looking at the fire

What are you talking about he asked in querulous suspicion

She drew a paper from her pocket

Its that draft of yours that you were crazy enough to sign Dawsons
name to It was lying out there on the desk I reckon it isnt a thing
you care to have kept as evidence even by your father

She held it in the flames until it was consumed

By Jove your head is level Lottie he said with an admiration that
was not however without a weak reserve of suspicion

No it isnt or I wouldnt be here she said curtly Then she added
as if dismissing the subject Well what did you tell her

Oh I said I met you in New York You see I thought she might think it
queer if she knew I only met you in San Francisco three weeks ago Of
course I said we were married

She looked at him with weary astonishment

And of course whether things go right or not shell find out that
Ive got a husband living that I never met you in New York but on the
steamer and that youve lied I dont see the USE of it You said
you were going to tell the whole thing squarely and say the truth and
thats why I came to help you

Yes but dont you see hang it all he stammered in the irritation
of weak confusion I had to tell her SOMETHING Father wont dare to
tell her the truth no more than he will the neighbors Hell hush it
up you bet and when we get this thing fixed youll go and get your
divorce you know and well be married privately on the square

He looked so vague so immature yet so fatuously selfconfident that
the woman extended her hand with a laugh and tapped him on the back as
she might have patted a dog Then she disappeared to follow Zuleika in
the kitchen

When the two women returned together they were evidently on the best
of terms So much so that the man with the easy reaction of a shallow
nature became sanguine and exalted even to an ostentatious exhibition
of those New York graces on which the paternal Hays had set such store
He complacently explained the methods by which he had deceived Dr
Dawson how he had himself written a letter from his father commanding
him to return to take his brothers place and how he had shown it to
the Doctor and been three months in San Francisco looking for work and
assisting Lottie at the theatre until a conviction of the righteousness
of his cause perhaps combined with the fact that they were also short
of money and she had no engagement impelled him to his present heroic
step All of which Zuleika listened to with childish interest but
superior appreciation of his companion The fact that this woman was an
actress an abomination vaguely alluded to by her father as being even
more mysteriously wicked than her sister and mother and correspondingly
exciting as offering a possible permanent relief to the monotony of her
home life seemed to excuse her brothers weakness She was almost ready
to become his partisanAFTER she had seen her father

They had talked largely of their plans they had settled small details
of the future and the arrangement of the property they had agreed that
Zuleika should be relieved of her household drudgery and sent to
a fashionable school in San Francisco with a music teacher and a
dressmaker They had discussed everything but the precise manner in
which the revelation should be conveyed to Hays There was still plenty
of time for that for he would not return until tomorrow at noon
and it was already tacitly understood that the vehicle of transmission
should be a letter from the Summit Hotel The possible contingency of
a sudden outburst of human passion not entirely controlled by religious
feeling was to be guarded against

They were sitting comfortably before the replenished fire the wind was
still moaning in the chimney when suddenly in a lull of the storm
the sound of sleighbells seemed to fill the room It was followed by a
voice from without and with a hysterical cry Zuleika started to her
feet The same breathless smile with which she had greeted her brother
an hour ago was upon her lips as she gasped

Lord save usbut its dad come back

I grieve to say that here the doughty redresser of domestic wrongs and
retriever of the family honor lapsed whitefaced in his chair idealess
and tremulous It was his frailer companion who rose to the occasion
and even partly dragged him with her Go back to the hotel she said
quickly and take the sled with youyou are not fit to face him now
But he does not know ME and I will stay To the staring Zuleika I am
a stranger stopped by a broken sleigh on my way to the hotel Leave the
rest to me Now clear out both of you Ill let him in

She looked so confident selfcontained and superior that the thought
of opposition never entered their minds and as an impatient rapping
rose from the door they let her with a halfimpatient halflaughing
gesture drive them before her from the room When they had disappeared
in the distance she turned to the front door unbolted and opened it
Hays blundered in out of the snow with a muttered exclamation and then
as the light from the open office door revealed a stranger started and
fell back

Miss Hays is busy said the woman quietly I am afraid on my
account But my sleigh broke down on the way to the hotel and I was
forced to get out here I suppose this is Mr Hays

A strange womanby her dress and appearance a very worldlingand even
braver in looks and apparel than many he had seen in the citiesseemed
in spite of all his precautions to have fallen short of the hotel
and been precipitated upon him Yet under the influence of some odd
abstraction he was affected by it less than he could have believed He
even achieved a rude bow as he bolted the door and ushered her into
the office More than that he found himself explaining to the fair
trespasser the reasons of his return to his own home For like a direct
man he had a consciousness of some inconsistency in his returnor
in the circumstances that induced a change of plans which might
conscientiously require an explanation

You see maam a rather singular thing happened to me after I passed
the summit Three times I lost the track got off it somehow and found
myself traveling in a circle The third time when I struck my own
tracks again I concluded Id just follow them back here I suppose
I might have got the road again by tryin and fightin the snowbut
thers some things not worth the fightin This was a matter of
business and after all maam business aint everythin is it

He was evidently in some unusual mood the mood that with certain
reticent natures often compels them to make their brief confidences to
utter strangers rather than impart them to those intimate friends who
might remind them of their weakness She agreed with him pleasantly but
not so obviously as to excite suspicion And you preferred to let your
business go and come back to the comfort of your own home and family

The comfort of my home and family he repeated in a dry deliberate
voice Well I reckon I aint been tempted much by THAT That isnt
what I meant But he went back to the phrase repeating it grimly as
if it were some mandatory text The comfort of my OWN HOME AND FAMILY
Well Satan hasnt set THAT trap for my feet yet maam No ye saw my
daughter well thats all my family ye see this room thats all my
home My wife ran away from me my daughter cleared out too my eldest
son as was with me here has quolled with me and reckons to set up
a rival business agin me No he said still more meditatively and
deliberately it wasnt to come back to the comforts of my own home and
family that I faced round on Heavy Tree Hill I reckon

As the woman for certain reasons had no desire to check this
auspicious and unlooked for confidence she waited patiently Hays
remained silent for an instant warming his hands before the fire and
then looked up interrogatively

A professor of religion maam or under conviction

Not exactly said the lady smiling

Excuse me but in spite of your fine clothes I reckoned you had a
serious look just now A reader of Scripture may be

I know the Bible

You remember when the angel with the flamin sword appeared unto Saul
on the road to Damascus

Yes

It mout hev been suthin in that style that stopped me he said slowly
and tentatively Though natrally I didnt SEE anything and only had
the queer feelin It might hev been THAT shied my mare off the track

But Saul was up to some wickedness wasnt he said the lady
smilingly while YOU were simply going somewhere on business

Yes said Hays thoughtfully but my BUSINESS might hev seemed like
persecution I dont mind tellin you what it was if youd care to
listen But mebbe youre tired Mebbe you want to retire You know he
went on with a sudden hospitable outburst you neednt be in any
hurry to go we kin take care of you here tonight and itll cost you
nothin And Ill send you on with my sleigh in the mornin Peraps
youd like suthin to eata cup of teaorIll call Zuleika and he
rose with an expression of awkward courtesy

But the lady albeit with a selfsatisfied sparkle in her dark
eyes here carelessly assured him that Zuleika had already given her
refreshment and indeed was at that moment preparing her own room for
her She begged he would not interrupt his interesting story

Hays looked relieved

Well I reckon I wont call her for what I was goin to say aint
exackly the sort o thin for an innocent simple sort o thing like her
to hearI mean he interrupted himself hastilythat folks of more
experience of the world like you and me dont mind speakin ofIm
sorter takin it for granted that youre a married woman maam

The lady who had regarded him with a sudden rigidity here relaxed her
expression and nodded

Well continued Hays resuming his place by the fire you see this
yer man I was goin to see lives about four miles beyond the summit on
a ranch that furnishes most of the hay for the stock that side of the
Divide Hes bin holdin off his next years contracts with me hopin
to make better terms from the prospects of a late spring and higher
prices He held his head mighty high and talked big of waitin his own
time I happened to know he couldnt do it

He put his hands on his knees and stared at the fire and then went
on

Ye see this man had had crosses and family trials He had a wife that
left him to jine a lot of bally dancers and painted women in the Frisco
playhouses when he was livin in the southern country Youll say that
was like MY own caseand mebbe that was why it came to him to tell
me about itbut the difference betwixt HIM and ME was that instead
of restin unto the Lord and findin Him and pluckin out the eye
that offended him cordin to Scripter as I did HE followed after HER
tryin to get her back until findin that wasnt no use he took a
big disgust and came up here to hide hisself where there wasnt no
playhouse nor playactors and no wimmen but Injin squaws He preempted
the land and natrally there bein no one ez cared to live there but
himself he had it all his own way made it pay and as I was sayin
before held his head high for prices Wellyou aint gettin tired
maam

No said the lady resting her cheek on her hand and gazing on the
fire its all very interesting and so odd that you two men with
nearly the same experiences should be neighbors

Say buyer and seller maam not neighborsat least Scriptoorilynor
friends Wellnow this is where the Speshal Providence comes inonly
this afternoon Jim Briggs hearin me speak of Horseleys offishness

WHOSE offishness asked the lady

Horseleys offishnessHorseleys the name of the man Im talkin
about Well hearin that he says You hold on Hays and hell
climb down That wife of his has left the stagegot sick of itand is
driftin round in Frisco with some fellow When Horseley gets to hear
that you cant keep him herehell settle up sell out and realize
on everything hes got to go after her aginyou bet Thats what
Briggs said Well thats what sent me up to Horseleys tonightto get
there drop the news and then pin him down to that contract

It looked like a good stroke of business and a fair one said the lady
in an odd voice It was so odd that Hays looked up But she had somewhat
altered her position and was gazing at the ceiling and with her hand
to her face seemed to have just recovered from a slight yawn at which
he hesitated with a new and timid sense of politeness

Youre gettin tired maam

Oh dear no she said in the same voice but clearing her throat with
a little cough And why didnt you see this Mr Horseley after all Oh
I forgotyou said you changed your mind from something youd heard

He had turned his eyes to the fire again but without noticing as he
did so that she slowly moved her face still half hidden by her hand
towards him and was watching him intently

No he said slowly nothin I heard somethin I felt It mout hev
been that that set me off the track It kem to me all of a sudden that
he might be sittin thar calm and peaceful like ez I might be here
hevin forgot all about her and his trouble and here was me goin to
drop down upon him and start it all fresh agin It looked a little like
persecutionyes like persecution I got rid of it sayin to myself
it was business But Id got off the road meantime and had to find
it again and whenever I got back to the track and was pointed for his
house it all seemed to come back on me and set me off agin When that
had happened three times I turned round and started for home

And do you mean to say said the lady with a discordant laugh that
you believe because YOU didnt go there and break the news that nobody
else will That he wont hear of it from the first man he meets

He dont meet any one up where he lives and only Briggs and myself
know it and Ill see that Briggs dont tell But it was mighty queer
this whole thing comin upon me suddenlywasnt it

Very queer replied the lady forwith the same metallic
laughyou dont seem to be given to this kind of weakness with your
own family

If there was any doubt as to the sarcastic suggestion of her voice
there certainly could be none in the wicked glitter of her eyes fixed
upon his face under her shading hand But haply he seemed unconscious of
both and even accepted her statement without an ulterior significance

Yes he said communingly to the glaring embers of the hearth it
must have been a special revelation

There was something so fatuous and oneidead in his attitude and
expression so monstrously inconsistent and inadequate to what was going
on around him and so hopelessly stupidif a mere simulationthat the
angry suspicion that he was acting a part slowly faded from her eyes
and a hysterical smile began to twitch her set lips She still gazed
at him The wind howled drearily in the chimney all that was economic
grim and cheerless in the room seemed to gather as flitting shadows
around that central figure Suddenly she arose with such a quick
rustling of her skirts that he lifted his eyes with a start for she
was standing immediately before him her hands behind her her handsome
audacious face bent smilingly forward and her bold brilliant eyes
within a foot of his own

Now Mr Hays do you want to know what this warning or special
revelation of yours REALLY meant Well it had nothing whatever to do
with that man on the summit No The whole interest gist and meaning
of it was simply this that you should turn round and come straight
back here andshe drew back and made him an exaggerated theatrical
curtseyhave the supreme pleasure of making MY acquaintance That was
all And now as youve HAD IT in five minutes I must be off Youve
offered me already your horse and sleigh to go to the summit I accept
it and go Goodby

He knew nothing of a womans coquettish humor he knew still less of
that mimic stage from which her present voice gesture and expression
were borrowed he had no knowledge of the burlesque emotions which that
voice gesture and expression were supposed to portray and finally and
fatally he was unable to detect the feminine hysteric jar and discord
that underlay it all He thought it was strong characteristic and
real and accepted it literally He rose

Ef you allow you cant stay why Ill go and get the horse I reckon he
aint bin put up yet

Do please

He grimly resumed his coat and hat and disappeared through the passage
into the kitchen whence a moment later Zuleika came flying

Well what has happened she said eagerly

Its all right said the woman quickly though he knows nothing yet
But Ive got things fixed generally so that hell be quite ready to
have it broken to him by this time tomorrow But dont you say anything
till Ive seen Jack and you hear from HIM Remember

She spoke rapidly her cheeks were quite glowing from some sudden
energy so were Zuleikas with the excitement of curiosity Presently
the sound of sleighbells again filled the room It was Hays leading the
horse and sleigh to the door beneath a sky now starlit and crisp
under a northeast wind The fair stranger cast a significant glance at
Zuleika and whispered hurriedly You know he must not come with me
You must keep him here

She ran to the door muffled and hooded leaped into the sleigh and
gathered up the reins

But you cannot go alone said Hays with awkward courtesy I was
kalkilatin

Youre too tired to go out again dad broke in Zuleikas voice
quickly You aint fit youre all gray and krinkly now like as when
you had one of your last spells Shell send the sleigh back tomorrow

I can find my way said the lady briskly theres only one turn off
I believe and that

Leads to the stage station three miles west You neednt be afraid of
gettin off on that for youll likely see the down stage crossin your
road ez soon ez you get clear of the ranch

Goodnight said the lady An arc of white spray sprang before the
forward runner and the sleigh vanished in the road

Father and daughter returned to the office

You didnt get to know her dad did ye queried Zuleika

No responded Hays gravely except to see she wasnt no backwoods or
mountaineering sort Now theres the kind of woman Zuly as knows her
own mind and yours too that a man like your brother Jack oughter pick
out when he marries

Zuleikas face beamed behind her father You aint goin to sit up any
longer dad she said as she noticed him resume his seat by the fire
Its gettin late and you look mighty tuckered out with your nights
work

Do you know what she said Zuly returned her father after a pause
which turned out to have been a long silent laugh

No

She said he repeated slowly that she reckoned I came back here
tonight to have the pleasure of her acquaintance He brought his
two hands heavily down upon his knees rubbing them down deliberately
towards his ankles and leaning forward with his face to the fire and a
longsustained smile of complete though tardy appreciation

He was still in this attitude when Zuleika left him The wind crooned
over him confidentially but he still sat there given up apparently to
some posthumous enjoyment of his visitors departing witticism

It was scarcely daylight when Zuleika while dressing heard a quick
tapping upon her shutter She opened it to the scared and bewildered
face of her brother

What happened with her and father last night he said hoarsely

Nothingwhy

Read that It was brought to me half an hour ago by a man in dads
sleigh from the stage station

He handed her a crumpled note with trembling fingers She took it and
read

The games up and Im out of it Take my advice and clear out of it
too until you can come back in better shape Dont be such a fool as
to try and follow me Your father isnt one and thats where youve
slipped up

He shall pay for it whatever hes done said her brother with an
access of wild passion Where is he

Why Jack you wouldnt dare to see him now

Wouldnt I He turned and ran convulsed with passion before the
windows towards the front of the house Zuleika slipped out of her
bedroom and ran to her fathers room He was not there Already she
could hear her brother hammering frantically against the locked front
door

The door of the office was partly open Her father was still there
Asleep Yes for he had apparently sunk forward before the cold hearth
But the hands that he had always been trying to warm were colder than
the hearth or ashes and he himself never again spoke nor stirred



It was deemed providential by the neighbors that his youngest and
favorite son alarmed by news of his fathers failing health had
arrived from the Atlantic States just at the last moment But it was
thought singular that after the division of the property he entirely
abandoned the Ranch and that even pending the division his beautiful
but fastidious Eastern bride declined to visit it with her husband




JOHNSONS OLD WOMAN


It was growing dark and the Sonora trail was becoming more indistinct
before me at every step The difficulty had increased over the grassy
slope where the overflow from some smaller watercourse above had worn a
number of diverging gullies so like the trail as to be undistinguishable
from it Unable to determine which was the right one I threw the reins
over the mules neck and resolved to trust to that superior animals
sagacity of which I had heard so much But I had not taken into account
the equally wellknown weaknesses of sex and species and Chu Chu had
already shown uncontrollable signs of wanting her own way Without a
moments hesitation feeling the relaxed bridle she lay down and rolled
over

In this perplexity the sound of horses hoofs ringing out of the rocky
canyon beyond was a relief even if momentarily embarrassing An instant
afterwards a horse and rider appeared cantering round the hill on what
was evidently the lost trail and pulled up as I succeeded in forcing
Chu Chu to her legs again

Is that the trail from Sonora I asked

Yes but with a critical glance at the mule I reckon you aint going
thar tonight

Why not

Its a matter of eighteen miles and most of it a blind trail through
the woods after you take the valley

Is it worse than this

Whats the matter with this trail Ye aint expecting a racecourse or a
shell road over the foothillsare ye

No Is there any hotel where I can stop

Nary

Nor any house

No

Thank you Goodnight

He had already passed on when he halted again and turned in his saddle
Look yer Just a spell over yon canyon yell find a patch o buckeyes
turn to the right and yell see a trail Thatll take ye to a shanty
You ask if its Johnsons

Whos Johnson

I am You aint lookin for Vanderbilt or God Almighty up here are
you Well then you hark to me will you You say to my old woman to
give you supper and a shakedown somewhar tonight Say I sent you So
long

He was gone before I could accept or decline An extraordinary noise
proceeded from Chu Chu not unlike a suppressed chuckle I looked
sharply at her she coughed affectedly and with her head and neck
stretched to their greatest length appeared to contemplate her neat
little off fore shoe with admiring abstraction But as soon as I had
mounted she set off abruptly crossed the rocky canyon apparently
sighted the patch of buckeyes of her own volition and without the
slightest hesitation found the trail to the right and in half an hour
stood before the shanty

It was a log cabin with an additional leanto of the same material
roofed with bark and on the other side a larger and more ambitious
extension built of rough unplaned and unpainted redwood boards
lightly shingled The leanto was evidently used as a kitchen and
the central cabin as a livingroom The barking of a dog as I approached
called four children of different sizes to the open door where already
an enterprising baby was feebly essaying to crawl over a bar of wood
laid across the threshold to restrain it

Is this Johnsons house

My remark was really addressed to the eldest a boy of apparently nine
or ten but I felt that my attention was unduly fascinated by the baby
who at that moment had toppled over the bar and was calmly eyeing
me upside down while silently and heroically suffocating in its
petticoats The boy disappeared without replying but presently returned
with a taller girl of fourteen or fifteen I was struck with the way
that as she reached the door she passed her hands rapidly over the
heads of the others as if counting them picked up the baby reversed
it shook out its clothes and returned it to the inside without even
looking at it The act was evidently automatic and habitual

I repeated my question timidly

Yes it WAS Johnsons but he had just gone to Kings Mills I replied
hurriedly that I knew itthat I had met him beyond the canyon As I
had lost my way and couldnt get to Sonora tonight he had been good
enough to say that I might stay there until morning My voice was
slightly raised for the benefit of Mr Johnsons old woman who I had
no doubt was inspecting me furtively from some corner

The girl drew the children away except the boy To him she said
simply Show the stranger whar to stake out his mule Dolphus and
disappeared in the extension without another word I followed my
little guide who was perhaps more actively curious but equally
unresponsive To my various questions he simply returned a smile of
exasperating vacuity But he never took his eager eyes from me and I
was satisfied that not a detail of my appearance escaped him Leading
the way behind the house to a little wood whose only clearing
had been effected by decay or storm he stood silently apart while
I picketed Chu Chu neither offering to assist me nor opposing any
interruption to my survey of the locality There was no trace of human
cultivation in the surroundings of the cabin the wilderness still trod
sharply on the heels of the pioneers fresh footprints and even seemed
to obliterate them For a few yards around the actual dwelling there
was an unsavory fringe of civilization in the shape of castoff clothes
empty bottles and tin cans and the adjacent thorn and elder bushes
blossomed unwholesomely with bits of torn white paper and bleaching
dishcloths This hideous circle never widened Nature always appeared
to roll back the intruding debris no bird nor beast carried it away no
animal ever forced the uncleanly barrier civilization remained grimly
trenched in its own exuvia The old terrifying girdle of fire around the
hunters camp was not more deterring to curious night prowlers than this
coarse and accidental outwork

When I regained the cabin I found it empty the doors of the leanto and
extension closed but there was a stool set before a rude table upon
which smoked a tin cup of coffee a tin dish of hot saleratus biscuit
and a plate of fried beef There was something odd and depressing in
this silent exclusion of my presence Had Johnsons old woman from
some dark post of observation taken a dislike to my appearance or was
this churlish withdrawal a peculiarity of Sierran hospitality Or was
Mrs Johnson young and pretty and hidden under the restricting ban of
Johnsons jealousy or was she a deformed cripple or even a bedridden
crone From the extension at times came a murmur of voices but never
the accents of adult womanhood The gathering darkness relieved only by
a dull glow from the smouldering logs in the adobe chimney added to my
loneliness In the circumstances I knew I ought to have put aside the
repast and given myself up to gloomy and pessimistic reflection but
Nature is often inconsistent and in that keen mountain air I grieve
to say my physical and moral condition was not in that perfect accord
always indicated by romancers I had an appetite and I gratified it
dyspepsia and ethical reflections might come later I ate the saleratus
biscuit cheerfully and was meditatively finishing my coffee when a
gurgling sound from the rafters above attracted my attention I looked
up under the overhang of the bark roof three pairs of round eyes were
fixed upon me They belonged to the children I had previously seen
who in the attitude of Raphaels cherubs had evidently been deeply
interested spectators of my repast As our eyes met an inarticulate
giggle escaped the lips of the youngest

I never could understand why the shy amusement of children over their
elders is not accepted as philosophically by its object as when it
proceeds from an equal We fondly believe that when Jones or Brown
laughs at us it is from malice ignorance or a desire to show his
superiority but there is always a haunting suspicion in our minds that
these little critics REALLY see something in us to laugh at I however
smiled affably in return ignoring any possible grotesqueness in my
manner of eating in private

Come here Johnny I said blandly

The two elder ones a girl and a boy disappeared instantly as if the
crowning joke of this remark was too much for them From a scraping and
kicking against the log wall I judged that they had quickly dropped to
the ground outside The younger one the giggler remained fascinated
but ready to fly at a moments warning

Come here Johnny boy I repeated gently I want you to go to your
mother please and tell her

But here the child who had been working its face convulsively suddenly
uttered a lugubrious howl and disappeared also I ran to the front door
and looked out in time to see the tallest girl who had received me
walking away with it under her arm pushing the boy ahead of her
and looking back over her shoulder not unlike a youthful shebear
conducting her cubs from danger She disappeared at the end of the
extension where there was evidently another door

It was very extraordinary It was not strange that I turned back to
the cabin with a chagrin and mortification which for a moment made me
entertain the wild idea of saddling Chu Chu and shaking the dust of
that taciturn house from my feet But the ridiculousness of such an act
to say nothing of its ingratitude as quickly presented itself to me
Johnson had offered me only food and shelter I could have claimed no
more from the inn I had asked him to direct me to I did not reenter
the house but lighting my last cigar began to walk gloomily up and
down the trail With the outcoming of the stars it had grown lighter
through a wind opening in the trees I could see the heavy bulk of the
opposite mountain and beyond it a superior crest defined by a red line
of forest fire which however cast no reflection on the surrounding
earth or sky Faint woodland currents of air still warm from the
afternoon sun stirred the leaves around me with longdrawn aromatic
breaths But these in time gave way to the steady Sierran night wind
sweeping down from the higher summits and rocking the tops of the
tallest pines yet leaving the tranquillity of the dark lower aisles
unshaken It was very quiet there was no cry nor call of beast or bird
in the darkness the long rustle of the treetops sounded as faint as
the faroff wash of distant seas Nor did the resemblance cease there
the closeset files of the pines and cedars stretching in illimitable
ranks to the horizon were filled with the immeasurable loneliness of
an ocean shore In this vast silence I began to think I understood the
taciturnity of the dwellers in the solitary cabin

When I returned however I was surprised to find the tallest girl
standing by the door As I approached she retreated before me and
pointing to the corner where a common cot bed had been evidently just
put up said Ye can turn in thar only yell have to rouse out early
when Dolphus does the chores and was turning towards the extension
again when I stopped her almost appealingly

One moment please Can I see your mother

She stopped and looked at me with a singular expression Then she said
sharply

You know fust rate shes dead

She was turning away again but I think she must have seen my concern
in my face for she hesitated But I said quickly I certainly
understood your father that is Mr Johnson I added interrogatively
to say thatthat I was to speak toI didnt like to repeat the exact
phrasehis WIFE

I dont know what he was playin ye for she said shortly Mar has
been dead morn a year

But I persisted is there no grownup woman here

No

Then who takes care of you and the children

I do

Yourself and your fathereh

Dad aint here two days running and then ony to sleep

And you take the entire charge of the house

Yes and the log tallies

The log tallies

Yes keep count and measure the logs that go by the slide

It flashed upon me that I had passed the slide or declivity on the
hillside where logs were slipped down into the valley and I inferred
that Johnsons business was cutting timber for the mill

But youre rather young for all this work I suggested

Im goin on sixteen she said gravely

Indeed for the matter of that she might have been any age Her face
on which sunburn took the place of complexion was already hard and set
But on a nearer view I was struck with the fact that her eyes which
were not large were almost indistinguishable from the presence of the
most singular eyelashes I had ever seen Intensely black intensely
thick and even tangled in their profusion they bristled rather than
fringed her eyelids obliterating everything but the shining black
pupils beneath which were like certain lustrous hairy mountain berries
It was this woodland suggestion that seemed to uncannily connect her
with the locality I went on playfully

Thats not VERY oldbut tell medoes your father or DID your father
ever speak of you as his old woman

She nodded Then you thought I was mar she said smiling

It was such a relief to see her worn face relax its expression of
pathetic gravityalthough this operation quite buried her eyes in their
black thickest hedge againthat I continued cheerfully It wasnt much
of a mistake considering all you do for the house and family

Then you didnt tell Billy to go and be dead in the ground with mar
as he lows you did she said half suspiciously yet trembling on the
edge of a smile

No I had not but I admitted that my asking him to go to his mother
might have been open to this dismal construction by a sensitive infant
mind She seemed mollified and again turned to go

Goodnight Missyou know your father didnt tell me your real name
I said

Karline

Goodnight Miss Karline

I held out my hand

She looked at it and then at me through her intricate eyelashes Then
she struck it aside briskly but not unkindly said Quit foolin now
as she might have said to one of the children and disappeared through
the inner door Not knowing whether to be amused or indignant I
remained silent a moment Then I took a turn outside in the increasing
darkness listened to the now hurrying wind over the treetops
reentered the cabin closed the door and went to bed

But not to sleep Perhaps the responsibility towards these solitary
children which Johnson had so lightly shaken off devolved upon me as
I lay there for I found myself imagining a dozen emergencies of their
unprotected state with which the elder girl could scarcely grapple
There was little to fear from depredatory man or beastdesperadoes of
the mountain trail never stooped to ignoble burglary bear or panther
seldom approached a cabinbut there was the chance of sudden illness
fire the accidents that beset childhood to say nothing of the
narrowing moral and mental effect of their isolation at that tender age
It was scandalous in Johnson to leave them alone

In the silence I found I could hear quite distinctly the sound of their
voices in the extension and it was evident that Caroline was putting
them to bed Suddenly a voice was upliftedher own She began to sing
and the others to join her It was the repetition of a single verse of
a wellknown lugubrious negro melody All the world am sad and
dreary wailed Caroline in a high headnote everywhere I roam Oh
darkieth lisped the younger girl in response how my heart growth
weary far from the old folkth at hoome This was repeated two or
three times before the others seemed to get the full swing of it and
then the lines rose and fell sadly and monotonously in the darkness I
dont know why but I at once got the impression that those motherless
little creatures were under a vague belief that their performance was
devotional and was really filling the place of an evening hymn A brief
and indistinct kind of recitation followed by a dead silence broken
only by the slow creaking of new timber as if the house were stretching
itself to sleep too confirmed my impression Then all became quiet
again

But I was more wide awake than before Finally I rose dressed myself
and dragging my stool to the fire took a book from my knapsack and by
the light of a guttering candle which I discovered in a bottle in the
corner of the hearth began to read Presently I fell into a doze
How long I slept I could not tell for it seemed to me that a dreamy
consciousness of a dog barking at last forced itself upon me so strongly
that I awoke The barking appeared to come from behind the cabin in the
direction of the clearing where I had tethered Chu Chu I opened the
door hurriedly ran round the cabin towards the hollow and was almost
at once met by the bulk of the frightened Chu Chu plunging out of the
darkness towards me kept only in check by her reata in the hand of a
blanketed shape slowly advancing with a gun over its shoulder out of the
hollow Before I had time to recover from my astonishment I was thrown
into greater confusion by recognizing the shape as none other than
Caroline

Without the least embarrassment or even selfconsciousness of her
appearance she tossed the end of the reata to me with the curtest
explanation as she passed by Some prowling bear or catamount had
frightened the mule I had better tether it before the cabin away from
the wind

But I thought wild beasts never came so near I said quickly

Mule meats mighty temptin said the girl sententiously and passed
on I wanted to thank her I wanted to say how sorry I was that she
had been disturbed I wanted to compliment her on her quiet midnight
courage and yet warn her against recklessness I wanted to know whether
she had been accustomed to such alarms and if the gun she carried was
really a necessity But I could only respect her reticence and I was
turning away when I was struck by a more inexplicable spectacle As she
neared the end of the extension I distinctly saw the tall figure of
a man moving with a certain diffidence and hesitation that did not
however suggest any intention of concealment among the trees the girl
apparently saw him at the same moment and slightly slackened her pace
Not more than a dozen feet separated them He said something that was
inaudible to my earsbut whether from his hesitation or the distance
I could not determine There was no such uncertainty in her reply
however which was given in her usual curt fashion All right You can
trapse along home now and turn in

She turned the corner of the extension and disappeared The tall figure
of the man wavered hesitatingly for a moment and then vanished also
But I was too much excited by curiosity to accept this unsatisfactory
conclusion and hastily picketing Chu Chu a few rods from the front
door I ran after him with an instinctive feeling that he had not gone
far I was right A few paces distant he had halted in the same dubious
lingering way Hallo I said

He turned towards me in the like awkward fashion but with neither
astonishment nor concern

Come up and take a drink with me before you go I said if youre not
in a hurry Im alone here and since I HAVE turned out I dont see why
we mightnt have a smoke and a talk together

I dursnt

I looked up at the six feet of strength before me and repeated
wonderingly Dare not

SHE wouldnt like it He made a movement with his right shoulder
towards the extension

Who

Miss Karline

Nonsense I said She isnt in the cabinyou wont see HER Come
along He hesitated although from what I could discern of his bearded
face it was weakly smiling

Come

He obeyed following me not unlike Chu Chu I fancied with the same
sense of superior size and strength and a slight whitening of the eye
as if ready to shy at any moment At the door he backed Then he
entered sideways I noticed that he cleared the doorway at the top and
the sides only by a hairs breadth

By the light of the fire I could see that in spite of his full first
growth of beard he was youngeven younger than myselfand that he
was by no means badlooking As he still showed signs of retreating at
any moment I took my flask and tobacco from my saddlebags handed them
to him pointed to the stool and sat down myself upon the bed

You live near here

Yes he said a little abstractedly as if listening for some
interruption at Ten Mile Crossing

Why thats two miles away

I reckon

Then you dont live hereon the clearing

No I blong to the mill at Ten Mile

You were on your way home

No he hesitated looking at his pipe I kinder meander round here at
this time when Johnsons away to see if everythings goin straight

I seeyoure a friend of the family

Deed no He stopped laughed looked confused and added apparently
to his pipe That is a sorter friend Not much SHEhe lowered his
voice as if that potential personality filled the whole cabinwouldnt
like it

Then at night when Johnsons away you do sentry duty round the
house

Yes sentry dooty thats ithe seemed impressed with the
suggestionthats it Sentry dooty Youve struck it pardner

And how often is Johnson away

Bout two or three times a week on an average

But Miss Caroline appears to be able to take care of herself She has
no fear

Fear Fear wasnt hangin round when SHE was born He paused No
sir Did ye ever look into them eyes

I hadnt on account of the lashes But I didnt care to say this and
only nodded

There aint the created thing livin or dead that she cant stand
straight up to and look at

I wondered if he had fancied she experienced any difficulty in standing
up before that innocently goodhumored face but I could not resist
saying

Then I dont see the use of your walking four miles to look after her

I was sorry for it the next minute for he seemed to have awkwardly
broken his pipe and had to bend down for a long time afterwards to
laboriously pick up the smallest fragments of it At last he said
cautiously

Ye noticed them bits o flannin round the chillerns throats

I remembered that I had but was uncertain whether it was intended as a
preventive of cold or a childs idea of decoration I nodded

Thats their trouble One night when old Johnson had been off for
three days to Coulterville I was prowling round here and I didnt git
to see no one though there was a light burnin in the shanty all night
The next night I was here againthe same light twinklin but no one
about I reckoned that was mighty queer and I jess crep up to the
house an listened I heard suthin like a little cough oncet in a
while and at times suthin like a little moan I didnt durst to sing
out for I knew SHE wouldnt like it but whistled keerless like to let
the chillern know I was there But it didnt seem to take I was jess
goin off whendarn my skinif I didnt come across the bucket of
water Id fetched up from the spring THAT MORNIN standin there full
and NEVER TAKEN IN When I saw that I reckoned Id jess wade in anyhow
and I knocked Pooty soon the door was half opened and I saw her eyes
blazin at me like them coals Then SHE lowed Id better git up and
git and shet the door to Then I lowed she might tell me what was
upthrough the door Then she said through the door as how the
chillern lay all sick with that hossdistemper diphthery Then she
lowed shed use a doctor ef Id fetch him Then she lowed again Id
better take the baby that hadnt ketched it yet along with me and leave
it where it was safe Then she passed out the baby through the door all
wrapped up in a blankit like a papoose and you bet I made tracks with
it I knowed thar wasnt no good going to the mill so I let out for
Whites four miles beyond whar there was Whites old mother I told
her how things were pointin and she lent me a hoss and I jess rounded
on Doctor Green at Mountain Jims and had him back here afore sunup
And then I heard she wiltedregularly played out you seefor she
had it all along wuss than the lot and never let on or whimpered

It was well you persisted in seeing her that night I said watching
the rapt expression of his face He looked up quickly became conscious
of my scrutiny and dropped his eyes again smiled feebly and drawing a
circle in the ashes with the broken pipestem said

But SHE didnt like it though

I suggested a little warmly that if she allowed her father to leave
her alone at night with delicate children she had no right to choose
WHO should assist her in an emergency It struck me afterwards that this
was not very complimentary to him and I added hastily that I wondered
if she expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at
midnight But this reminded me of Johnsons style of argument and I
stopped

Yes he said meekly and ef she didnt keer enough for herself and
her brothers and sisters she orter remember them Beazeley chillern

Beazeley children I repeated wonderingly

Yes them two little ones the size of Mirandy theyre Beazeleys

Who is Beazeley and what are his children doing here

Beazeley up and died at the mill and she bedevilled her father to let
her take his two young uns here

You dont mean to say that with her other work shes taking care of
other peoples children too

Yes and eddicatin them

Educating them

Yes teachin them to read and write and do sums One of our loggers
ketched her at it when she was keepin tally

We were both silent for some moments

I suppose you know Johnson I said finally

Not much

But you call here at other times than when youre helping her

Never been in the house before

He looked slowly around him as he spoke raising his eyes to the bare
rafters above and drawing a few long breaths as if he were inhaling
the aura of some unseen presence He appeared so perfectly gratified and
contented and I was so impressed with this humble and silent absorption
of the sacred interior that I felt vaguely conscious that any
interruption of it was a profanation and I sat still gazing at the
dying fire Presently he arose stretched out his hand shook mine
warmly said I reckon Ill meander along took another long breath
this time secretly as if conscious of my eyes and then slouched
sideways out of the house into the darkness again where he seemed
suddenly to attain his full height and so looming disappeared I shut
the door went to bed and slept soundly

So soundly that when I awoke the sun was streaming on my bed from the
open door On the table before me my breakfast was already laid When I
had dressed and eaten it struck by the silence I went to the door and
looked out Dolphus was holding Chu Chu by the reata a few paces from
the cabin

Wheres Caroline I asked

He pointed to the woods and said Over yon keeping tally

Did she leave any message

Said I was to git your mule for you

Anything else

Yes said you was to go

I went but not until I had scrawled a few words of thanks on a leaf of
my notebook which I wrapped about my last Spanish dollar addressed it
to Miss Johnson and laid it upon the table



It was more than a year later that in the barroom of the Mariposa Hotel
a hand was laid upon my sleeve I looked up It was Johnson

He drew from his pocket a Spanish dollar I reckoned he said
cheerfully Id run again ye somewhar some time My old woman told me
to give ye that when I did and say that she didnt keep no hotel
But she allowed shed keep the letter and has spelled it out to the
chillern

Here was the opportunity I had longed for to touch Johnsons pride and
affection in the brave but unprotected girl I want to talk to you
about Miss Johnson I said eagerly

I reckon so he said with an exasperating smile Most fellers do
But she aint Miss Johnson no more Shes married

Not to that big chap over from Ten Mile Mills I said breathlessly

Whats the matter with HIM said Johnson Ye didnt expect her to
marry a nobleman did ye

I said I didnt see why she shouldntand believed that she HAD




THE NEW ASSISTANT AT PINE CLEARING SCHOOL


CHAPTER I


The schoolmistress of Pine Clearing was taking a last look around her
schoolroom before leaving it for the day She might have done so with
pride for the schoolroom was considered a marvel of architectural
elegance by the citizens and even to the ordinary observer was a
pretty villalike structure with an open cupola and overhanging roof
of diamondshaped shingles and a deep Elizabethan porch But it was
the monument of a fierce struggle between a newer civilization and a
barbarism of the old days which had resulted in the clearing away of
the pinesand a few other things as incongruous to the new life and far
less innocent though no less sincere It had cost the community fifteen
thousand dollars and the lives of two of its citizens

Happily there was no stain of this on the clean white walls the
beautifullywritten gilt texts or the shining blackboard that had
offered no record which could not be daily wiped away And certainly
the last person in the world to suggest any reminiscences of its
belligerent foundation was the person of the schoolmistress Mature
thin precisenot pretty enough to have excited Homeric feuds nor yet
so plain as to preclude certain soothing gracesshe was the widow of
a poor Congregational minister and had been expressly imported from
San Francisco to squarely mark the issue between the regenerate and
unregenerate life Lowvoiced gentlewomanly with the pallor of
illhealth perhaps unduly accented by her mourning which was still cut
modishly enough to show off her spare but good figure she was
supposed to represent the model of pious scholastic refinement The
Oppositionsullen in ditches and at the doors of saloons or in the
fields truculent as their own cattlenevertheless had lowered their
crests and buttoned their coats over their revolutionary red shirts when
SHE went by

As she was stepping from the threshold she was suddenly confronted by
a brisk businesslooking man who was about to enter Just in time to
catch you Mrs Martin he said hurriedly then quickly correcting his
manifest familiarity he added I mean I took the liberty of running
in here on my way to the stage office That matter you spoke of is
all arranged I talked it over with the other trustees wrote to Sam
Barstow and hes agreeable and has sent somebody up and he rapidly
consulted his watch he ought to be here now and Im on my way to meet
him with the other trustees

Mrs Martin who at once recognized her visitor as the Chairman of
the School Board received the abrupt information with the slight
tremulousness faint increase of color and hurried breathing of a
nervous woman

But she said it was only a SUGGESTION of mine Mr Sperry I really
have no right to askI had no idea

Its all right maamnever you mind We put the case square to
Barstow We allowed that the school was getting too large for you to
tackleI mean you know to superintend singlehanded and that these
Pike County boys theyre running in on us are a little too big and
sassy for a lady like you to lasso and throw downI mean to sorter
controldont you see But bless you Sam Barstow saw it all in a
minit He just jumped at it Ive got his letter herehold onhe
hastily produced a letter from his pocket glanced ever it suddenly
closed it again with embarrassed quickness yet not so quickly but that
the womans quicker eyes were caught and nervously fascinated by the
expression Im dd in a large business handand said in awkward
haste No matter about reading it nowkeep you too longbut hes
agreed all right you know Must go nowtheyll be waiting Only I
thought Id drop in apassin to keep you posted and taking off his
hat he began to back from the porch

Isisthis gentleman who is to assist meaa mature professional
manor agraduate hesitated Mrs Martin with a faint smile

Dont really knowI reckon SamMr Barstowfixed that all right
Must really go now and still holding his hat in his hand as a polite
compromise for his undignified haste he fairly ran off

Arrived at the stage office he found the two other trustees awaiting
him and the still more tardy stagecoach One a large smoothfaced
portly man was the Presbyterian minister the other of thinner and
more serious aspect was a large millowner

I presume said the Rev Mr Peaseley slowly that as our good
brother Barstow in the urgency of the occasion has to some
extent anticipated OUR functions in engaging this assistant he
isaasatisfied with his capacity

Sam knows what hes about said the millowner cheerfully and as
hes regularly buckled down to the work here and will go his bottom
dollar on it you can safely leave things to him

He certainly has exhibited great zeal said the reverend gentleman
patronizingly

Zeal echoed Sperry enthusiastically zeal Why he runs Pine
Clearing as he runs his bank and his express company in Sacramento and
hes as well posted as if he were here all the time Why look here
he nudged the millowner secretly and as the ministers back was
momentarily turned pulled out the letter he had avoided reading to Mrs
Martin and pointed to a paragraph Ill be dd said the writer
but Ill have peace and quietness at Pine Clearing if I have to wipe
out or make over the whole Pike County gang Draw on me for a piano if
you think Mrs Martin can work it But dont say anything to Peaseley
first or hell want it changed for a harmonium and that lets us in
for psalmsinging till you cant rest Mind I dont object to Church
influenceits a good holdbut you must run IT with other things
equal and not let it run YOU Ive got the schoolhouse insured for
thirty thousand dollarsspecial rates too

The millowner smiled Sams head is level But he added he dont
say much about the new assistant hes sending

Only here he says I reckon the man I send will do all round for
Pike County has its claims as well as Boston

What does that mean asked the millowner

I reckon he means he dont want Pine Clearing to get too hightoned
any more than he wants it too low down Hes mighty square in his
averagesis Sam

Here speculation was stopped by the rapid oncoming of the stagecoach
in all the impotent fury of a belated arrival Had to go round by
Montezuma to let off Jack Hill curtly explained the driver as he
swung himself from the box and entered the hotel barroom in company
with the new expressman who had evidently taken Hills place on the
boxseat Autocratically indifferent to further inquiry he called out
cheerfully Come along boys and hear this yer last new yarn about Sam
Barstowits the biggest thing out And in another moment the waiting
crowd with glasses in their hands were eagerly listening to the
repetition of the yarn from the new expressman to the apparent
exclusion of other matters mundane and practical

Thus debarred from information the three trustees could only watch
the passengers as they descended and try to identify their expected
stranger But in vain the bulk of the passengers they already knew the
others were ordinary miners and laborers there was no indication of the
new assistant among them Pending further inquiry they were obliged
to wait the conclusion of the expressmans humorous recital This was
evidently a performance of some artistic merit depending upon a capital
imitation of an Irishman a German Jew and another voice which was
universally recognized and applauded as being Sams style all over
But for the presence of the minister Sperry and the millowner would
have joined the enthusiastic auditors and inwardly regretted the
respectable obligations of their official position

When the storyteller had concluded amidst a general call for more
drinks Sperry approached the driver The latter recognizing him turned
to his companion carelessly said Heres one of em and was going
away when Sperry stopped him

We were expecting a young man

Yes said the driver impatiently and there he is I reckon

We dont mean the new expressman said the minister smiling blandly
but a young man who

THAT aint no new expressman returned the driver in scornful
deprecation of his interlocutors ignorance He only took Hills
place from Montezuma Hes the new kid reviver and polisher for that
University youre runnin here I sayyou fellers oughter get him to
tell you that story of Sam Barstow and the Chinaman Itd limber you
fellers up to hear it

I fear theres some extraordinary mistake here said Mr Peaseley
with a chilling Christian smile

Not a bit of it Hes got a letter from Sam for one of ye Yere
Charleywhats your name Com yere Yeres all yer three bosses waiting
for ye

And the supposed expressman and late narrator of amusing stories came
forward and presented his credentials as the assistant teacher of Pine
Clearing


CHAPTER II


Even the practical Mr Sperry was taken aback The young man before him
was squarely built with broad shoulders and a certain air of muscular
activity But his face although goodhumored was remarkable for
offering not the slightest indication of studious preoccupation or
mental training A large mouth light blue eyes a square jaw the other
features being indistinctivewere immobile as a maskexcept that
unlike a mask they seemed to actually reflect the vacuity of the mood
within instead of concealing it But as he saluted the trustees they
each had the same feeling that even this expression was imported and not
instinctive His face was cleanshaven and his hair cut so short as to
suggest that a wig of some kind was necessary to give it characteristic
or even ordinary human semblance His manner selfassured yet lacking
reality and his dress of respectable cut and material yet worn as if
it did not belong to him completed a picture as unlike a student or
schoolmaster as could be possibly conceived

Yet there was the letter in Mr Peaseleys hands from Barstow
introducing Mr Charles Twing as the first assistant teacher in the Pine
Clearing Free Academy

The three men looked hopelessly at each other An air of fatigued
righteousness and a desire to be spiritually at rest from other trials
pervaded Mr Peaseley Whether or not the young man felt the evident
objection he had raised he assumed a careless position with his back
and elbows against the bar but even the attitude was clearly not his
own

Are you personally known to Mr Barstow asked Sperry with a slight
business asperity

Yes

That isyou are quite well acquainted with him

If youd heard me gag his style a minute ago so that everybody here
knew who it was youd say so

Mr Peaseleys eyes sought the ceiling and rested on the hanging lamp
as if nothing short of direct providential interference could meet the
occasion Yet as the eyes of his brother trustees were bent on him
expectantly he nerved himself to say something

I suppose MrMr Twing you have properly understood the greatI
may say very grave intellectual and moral responsibilities of the
work you seek to undertakeand the necessity of supporting it by
EXAMPLE by practice by personal influence both in the school and OUT
OF IT Sir I presume sir you feel that you are fully competent to
undertake this

I reckon HE does

WHO does

Sam Barstow or he wouldnt have selected me I presume with the
slightest possible and almost instinctive imitation of the reverend
gentlemans manner his head is considered level

Mr Peaseley withdrew his eyes from the ceiling I have he said to
his companions with a pained smile an important choir meeting to
attend this afternoon I fear I must be excused As he moved towards
the door the others formally following him until out of the strangers
hearing he added I wash my hands of this After so wanton and
unseemly an exhibition of utter incompetency and even of understanding
of the trust imposed upon himupon USMY conscience forbids me to
interfere further But the real arbiter in this matter will bethank
Heaventhe mistress herself You have only to confront her at once
with this man HER decision will be speedy and final For even Mr
Barstow will not dare to force so outrageous a character upon a
delicate refined woman in a familiar and confidential capacity

Thats so said Sperry eagerly shell settle it And of course
added the millowner that will leave us out of any difficulty with
Sam

The two men returned to the hapless stranger relieved yet constrained
by the sacrifice to which they felt they were leading him It would be
necessary they said to introduce him to his principal Mrs Martin
at once They might still find her at the schoolhouse distant but a few
steps They said little else the stranger keeping up an ostentatious
whistling and becoming more and more incongruous they thought as they
neared the pretty schoolhouse Here they DID find Mrs Martin who had
naturally lingered after the interview with Sperry

She came forward to meet them with the nervous shyness and slightly
fastidious hesitation that was her nature They saw or fancied
they saw the same surprise and disappointment they had themselves
experienced pass over her sensitive face as she looked at him they
felt that their vulgar charge appeared still more outrageous by contrast
with this delicate woman and her pretty refined surroundings but they
saw that HE enjoyed it and was evenif such a word could be applied to
so selfconscious a manmore at ease in her presence

I reckon you and me will pull together very well maam he said
confidently

They looked to see her turn her back upon him faint or burst out
crying but she did neither and only gazed at him quietly

Its a mighty pretty place youve got hereand I like it and if WE
cant run it I dont know who can Only just let me know WHAT you want
maam and you can count on me every time

To their profound consternation Mrs Martin smiled faintly

It rests with YOU only Mrs Martin said Sperry quickly and
significantly Its YOUR say you know youre the only one to be
considered or consulted here

Only just say what you want me to do continued Twing apparently
ignoring the trustees pick out the style of job give me a hint or
two how to work it or what youd think would be the proper gag to fetch
em and Im there maam It may be new at first but Ill get at the
business of it quick enough

Mrs Martin smiledthis time quite perceptiblywith the least
little color in her cheeks and eyes Then youve had no experience in
teaching she said

Well no

You are not a graduate of any college

Not much

The two trustees looked at each other Even Mr Peaseley had not
conceived such a damning revelation

Well said Mrs Martin slowly perhaps Mr Twing had better COME
EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AND BEGIN

Begin gasped Mr Sperry in breathless astonishment

Certainly said Mrs Martin in timid explanation If he is new to the
work the sooner the better

Mr Sperry could only gaze blankly at his brother official Had they
heard aright Was this the recklessness of nervous excitement in a woman
of delicate health or had the impostor cast some glamour upon her Or
was she frightened of Sam Barstow and afraid to reject his candidate
The last thought was an inspiration He drew her quickly aside One
moment Mrs Martin You said to me an hour ago that you didnt intend
to have asked Mr Barstow to send you an assistant I hope that merely
because he HAS done so you dont feel obliged to accept this man
against your better judgment

Oh no said Mrs Martin quietly

The case seemed hopeless And Sperry had the miserable conviction that
by having insisted upon Mrs Martins judgment being final they had
estopped their own right to object But how could they have foreseen her
extraordinary taste He however roused himself for a last appeal

Mrs Martin he said in a lower voice I ought to tell you that the
Reverend Mr Peaseley strongly doubts the competency of that young man

Didnt Mr Barstow make a selection at your request asked Mrs
Martin with a faint little nervous cough

Yesbut

Then his competency only concerns MEand I dont see what Mr Peaseley
has to say about it

Could he believe his senses There was a decided flush in the womans
pale face and the first note of independence and asperity in her voice

That night in the privacy of his conjugal chamber Mr Sperry relieved
his mind to another of the enigmatical sexthe stout Southwestern
partner of his joys and troubles But the result was equally
unsatisfactory Well Abner said the lady I never could see for
all your mens praises of Mrs Martin what that feller can see in HER
to like


CHAPTER III


Mrs Martin was early at the schoolhouse the next morning yet not so
early but that she discovered that the new assistant had been there
before her This was shown in some rearrangement of the school seats and
benches They were placed so as to form a horseshoe before her desk and
at the further extremity of this semicircle was a chair evidently for
himself She was a little nettled at his premature action although
admitting the utility of the change but she was still more annoyed
at his absence at such a moment It was nearly the school hour when
he appeared to her surprise marshaling a file of some of the smaller
children whom he had evidently picked up en route and who were to her
greater surprise apparently on the best of terms with him Thought
Id better rake em in introduce myself to em and get em to know me
before school begins Excuse me he went on hastily but Ive a lot
more coming up and Id better make myself square with them OUTSIDE
But Mrs Martin had apparently developed a certain degree of stiffness
since their evenings interview

It seems to me quite as important Mr Twing she said drily that
you should first learn some of your own duties which I came here early
to teach you

Not at all he said cheerfully Today I take my seat as Ive
arranged it you see over there with them and watch em go through the
motions One rehearsals enough for ME At the same time I can chip in
if necessary And before she could reply he was out of the schoolhouse
again hailing the newcomers This was done with apparently such
delight to the children and with some evidently imported expression into
his smooth masklike face that Mrs Martin had to content herself with
watching him with equal curiosity She was turning away with a sudden
sense of forgotten dignity when a shout of joyous childish laughter
attracted her attention to the window The new assistant with half a
dozen small children on his square shoulders walking with bent back and
every simulation of advanced senility was evidently personating
with the assistance of astonishingly distorted features the ogre of a
Christmas pantomime As his eye caught hers the expression vanished the
masklike face returned he set the children down and moved away And
when school began although he marshaled them triumphantly to the very
doorwith what contortion of face or simulation of character she was
unable to guessafter he had entered the schoolroom and taken his seat
every vestige of his previous facial aberration was gone and only his
usual stolidity remained In vain as Mrs Martin expected the hundred
delighted little eyes before her dwelt at first eagerly and hopefully
upon his face but as she HAD NOT expected recognizing from the
blankness of his demeanor that the previous performance was intended for
them exclusively the same eager eyes were presently dropped again upon
their books in simple imitation as if he were one of themselves Mrs
Martin breathed freely and lessons began

Yet she was nervously conscious meanwhile of a more illomened
occurrence This was the nonarrival of several of her oldest pupils
notably the refractory and incorrigible Pike County contingent to whom
Sperry had alluded For the past few days they had hovered on the verge
of active insubordination and had indulged in vague mutterings which
she had resolutely determined not to hear It was therefore with some
inward trepidations not entirely relieved by Twings presence that she
saw the three Mackinnons and the two Hardees slouch into the school
a full hour after the lessons had begun They did not even excuse
themselves but were proceeding with a surly and ostentatious defiance
to their seats when Mrs Martin was obliged to look up andas the
eldest Hardee filed before herto demand an explanation The culprit
addresseda dull heavylooking youth of nineteenhesitated with an
air of mingled doggedness and sheepishness and then without replying
nudged his companion It was evidently a preconcerted signal of
rebellion for the boy nudged stopped and turning a more intelligent
but equally dissatisfied face upon the schoolmistress began
determinedly

Wots our excuse for coming an hour late Well we aint got none WE
dont call it an hour lateWE dont We call it the right time We call
it the right time for OUR lessons for we dont allow to come here to
sing hymns with babbies We dont want to know where oh where are the
Hebrew children They aint nothin to us Americans And we dont want
any more Daniels in the Lions Den played off on us We have enough of
em in Sundayschool We aint hankerin much for grammar and dictionary
hogwash and we dont want no Boston parts o speech rung in on us the
first thing in the monin We aint Bostonwere Pike CountyWE are
We reckon to do our sums and our figgerin and our sale and barter
and our interest tables and weights and measures when the time comes
and our geograffy when its on and our readin and writin and the
American Constitution in reglar hours and then we calkilate to git
up and git afore the potry and the Boston airs and graces come round
Thats our rights and what our fathers pay school taxes for and we want
em

He stopped looking less towards the schoolmistress than to his
companions for whom perhaps after the schoolboy fashion this attitude
was taken Mrs Martin sat quite white and selfcontained with her
eyes fixed on the frayed rim of the rebels straw hat which he still
kept on his head Then she said quietly

Take off your hat sir

The boy did not move

He cant said a voice cheerfully

It was the new assistant The whole school faced rapidly towards him
The rebel leader and his followers who had not noticed him before
stared at the interrupter who did not however seem to exhibit any of
the authority of office but rather the comment and criticism of one of
themselves Wot you mean asked the boy indignantly

I mean you cant take off your hat because youve got some things
stowed away in it you dont want seen said Twing with an immovable
face

Wot things exclaimed the boy angrily Then suddenly recollecting
himself he added Go along You cant fool me Think youll make me
take off my hatdont you

Well said Twing advancing to the side of the rebel look here
then With a dexterous movement and a slight struggle from the boy he
lifted the hat A halfdozen apples a birds nest two birds eggs
and a fluttering halffledged bird fell from it A wave of delight
and astonishment ran along the benches a blank look of hopeless
bewilderment settled upon the boys face and the gravity of the
situation disappeared forever in the irrepressible burst of laughter
in which even his brother rebels joined The smallest child who had been
halffrightened halffascinated by the bold bad heroic attitude of
the mutineer was quick to see the ridiculousness of that figure crowned
with cheap schoolboy plunder The eloquent protest of his wrongs was
lost in the ludicrous appearance of the protester Even Mrs Martin felt
that nothing she could say at that moment could lift the rebellion into
seriousness again But Twing was evidently not satisfied

Beg Mrs Martins pardon and say you were foolin with the boys he
said in a low voice

The discomfited rebel hesitated

Say it or Ill SHOW WHAT YOUVE GOT IN YOUR POCKETS said Twing in a
terribly significant aside

The boy mumbled an apology to Mrs Martin scrambled in a blank
hopeless way to his seat and the brief rebellion ignominiously ended
But two things struck Mrs Martin as peculiar She overheard the culprit
say with bated breath and evident sincerity to his comrades Hadnt
nothing in my hat anyway and one of the infant class was heard to
complain in a deeplyinjured way that the birds nest was HIS and had
been stoled from his desk And there still remained the fact for which
Twings undoubted fascination over the children had somewhat prepared
herthat at recess the malcontentsone and allseemed to have
forgiven the man who had overcome them and gathered round him with
unmistakable interest All this however did not blind her to the
serious intent of the rebellion or of Twings unaccountable assumption
of her prerogative While he was still romping with the children she
called him in

I must remind you she said with a slight nervous asperity that
this outrageous conduct of Tom Hardee was evidently deliberated and
prepared by the others and cannot end in this way

He looked at her with a face so exasperatingly expressionless that
she could have slapped it as if it had belonged to one of the older
scholars and saidBut it HAS ended Its a dead frost

I dont know what you mean and I must remind you also that in this
school we neither teach nor learn slang

His immobile face changed for an instant to a look of such decided
admiration that she felt her color rise but he wiped his expression
away with his hand as if it had been some artificial makeup and said
awkwardly but earnestly

Excuse mewont you But look here Mrs Martin I found out early
this morning when I was squaring myself with the other children that
there was this row hangin onin fact that there was a sort of idea
that Pike County wasnt having a fair showexcuse mein the running of
the school and that Peaseley and Barstow were a little too much on in
every scene In fact you see it was just what Tom said

This is insufferable said Mrs Martin her eyes growing darker as
her cheeks grew red They shall go home to their parents and tell them
from me

That theyre all mistakenexcuse mebut thats just what THEYRE
GOIN TO DO I tell you Mrs Martin their little games bustedI beg
pardonbut its all over Youll have no more trouble with them

And you think that just because you found Tom had something in his hat
and exposed him said Mrs Martin scornfully

Tom HADNT anything in his hat said Twing wiping his mouth slowly

Nothing repeated Mrs Martin

No

But I SAW you take the things out

That was only a TRICK He had nothing except what I had up my sleeve
and forced on him He knew it and that frightened him and made him
look like a fool and so bursted up his conspiracy Theres nothin
boys are more afraid of than ridicule or the man or boy that make em
ridiculous

I wont ask you if you call this FAIR to the boy Mr Twing said Mrs
Martin hotly but is this your idea of discipline

I call it fair because Tom knew it was some kind of a trick and
wasnt deceived I call it discipline if it made him do what was right
afterwards and makes him afraid or unwilling to do anything to offend
me or you again He likes me none the worse for giving him a chance of
being laughed out of a thing instead of being DRIVEN out of it And he
added with awkward earnestness if youll just leave all this to
ME and only consider me here to take this sort of work which aint
a ladysoff your hands well just strike our own line between the
Peaseleys and Pike Countyand run this school in spite of both

A little mollified a good deal puzzled and perhaps more influenced by
the mans manner than she had imagined Mrs Martin said nothing but
let the day pass without dismissing the offenders And on returning home
that evening she was considerably surprised to receive her landladys
extravagant congratulations on the advent of her new assistant And
they do say Mrs Martin continued that lady enthusiastically that
your just setting your foot down square on that Peaseley and that
Barstow BOTH OF EMand choosing your own assistant yourselfa plain
young fellow with no frills and fancies but one that you could set
about making all the changes you like was just the biggest thing you
ever did for Pine Clearing

Andtheyconsider him quitecompetent said Mrs Martin with timid
color and hesitating audacity

Competent You ask my Johnny

Nevertheless Mrs Martin was somewhat formally early at the schoolhouse
the next morning Perhaps she said with an odd mixture of dignity
and timidity wed better before school commences go over the lessons
for the day

I HAVE he said quickly I told you ONE rehearsal was enough for me

You mean you have looked over them

Got em by heart Letter perfect Want to hear me Listen

She did He had actually committed to memory and without a lapse the
entire text of rules questions answers and examples of the lessons
for the day


CHAPTER IV


Before a month had passed Mr Twings success was secure and
established So were a few of the changes he had quietly instituted
The devotional singing and Scripture reading which had excited the
discontent of the Pike County children and their parents was not
discontinued but half an hour before recess was given up to some
secular choruses patriotic or topical in which the little ones under
Twings really wonderful practical tuition exhibited such quick and
pleasing proficiency that a certain negro minstrel campmeeting
song attained sufficient popularity to be lifted by general accord to
promotion to the devotional exercises where it eventually ousted the
objectionable Hebrew children on the question of melody alone Grammar
was still taught at Pine Clearing School in spite of the Hardees and
Mackinnons but Twing had managed to import into the cognate exercises
of recitation a wonderful degree of enthusiasm and excellence
Dialectical Pike County that had refused to recognize the governing
powers of the nominative case nevertheless came out strong in classical
elocution and Tom Hardee who had delivered his ungrammatical protest
on behalf of Pike County was no less strong if more elegant in his
impeachment of Warren Hastings as Edmund Burke with the equal sanction
of his parents The trustees Sperry and Jackson had marveled but
were glad enough to accept the popular verdictonly Mr Peaseley still
retained an attitude of martyrlike forbearance and fatigued toleration
towards the new assistant and his changes As to Mrs Martin she seemed
to accept the work of Mr Twing after his own definition of itas of a
masculine quality illsuited to a ladys tastes and inclinations but it
was noticeable that while she had at first repelled any criticism of him
whatever she had lately been given to explaining his position to her
friends and had spoken of him with somewhat labored and ostentatious
patronage Yet when they were alone together she frankly found him very
amusing and his presumption and vulgarity so clearly unintentional that
it no longer offended her They were good friends without having any
confidences beyond the duties of the school she had asked no further
explanation of the fact that he had been selected by Mr Barstow
without reference to any special antecedent training What his actual
antecedents were she had never cared to know nor he apparently to
reveal that he had been engaged in some other occupations of superior
or inferior quality would not have been remarkable in a community where
the principal lawyer had been a soldier and the miller a doctor The
fact that he admired her was plain enough to HER that it pleased her
but carried with it no ulterior thought or responsibility might have
been equally clear to others Perhaps it was so to HIM

Howbeit this easy mutual intercourse was one day interrupted by what
seemed a trifling incident The piano which Mr Barstow had promised
duly made its appearance in the schoolhouse to the delight of the
scholars and the gentle satisfaction of Mrs Martin who in addition to
the rudimentary musical instruction of the younger girls occasionally
played upon it herself in a prim refined and conscientious fashion
To this when she was alone after school hours she sometimes added a
faint colorless voice of limited range and gentlewomanly expression It
was on one of these occasions that Twing becoming an accidental auditor
of this chaste sad piping was not only permitted to remain to hear the
end of a love song of strictly guarded passion in the subjunctive
mood but at the close was invited to try his handa quick if not a
cultivated oneat the instrument He did so Like her he added his
voice Like hers it was a love song But there the similitude ended
Negro in dialect illiterate in construction idiotic in passion and
presumably addressed to the Rose of Alabama in the very extravagance
of its childish infatuation it might have been a mockery of the
schoolmistresss song but for one tremendous fact In unrestrained
feeling pathetic yearning and exquisite tenderness of expression it
was unmistakably and appallingly personal and sincere It was true the
lips spoken of were lubly the eyes alluded to were like lightenin
bugs but from the voice and gestures of the singer Mrs Martin
confusedly felt that they were intended for HERS and even the refrain
that she dressed so neat and looked so sweet was glaringly allusive
to her own modish mourning Alternately flushing and paling with a
hysteric smile hovering round her small reserved mouth the unfortunate
gentlewoman was fain to turn to the window to keep her countenance until
it was concluded She did not ask him to repeat it nor did she again
subject herself to this palpable serenade but a few days afterwards as
she was idly striking the keys in the interval of a music lesson one
of her little pupils broke out Why Mrs Martin if yo aint a pickin
out that powful pretty tune that Mr Twing sings

Nevertheless when Twing a week or two later suggested that he might
sing the same song as a solo at a certain performance to be given by the
school children in aid of a local charity she drily intimated that it
was hardly of a character to suit the entertainment But she added
more gently you recite so well why not give a recitation

He looked at her with questioning and troubled eyesthe one expression
he seemed to have lately acquired But that would be IN PUBLIC
Therell be a lot of people there he said doubtfully

A little amused at this first apparent sign of a want of confidence in
himself she said with a reassuring smile So much the betteryou do
it really too well to have it thrown away entirely on children

Do YOU wish it he said suddenly

Somewhat confused but more irritated by his abruptness she replied
Why not But when the day came and before a crowded audience in
which there was a fair sprinkling of strangers she regretted her rash
suggestion For when the pupils had gone through certain calisthenic
exercisesadmirably taught and arranged by himand spoken their
pieces he arose and fixing his eyes on her began Othellos defense
before the Duke and Council Here as on the previous occasion she felt
herself personally alluded to in his account of his wooing
Desdemona for some occult reason vicariously appeared for her in the
unwarrantable picture of his passion and to this was added the absurd
consciousness which she could not put aside that the audience following
with enthusiasm his really strong declamation was also following his
suggestion and adopting it Yet she was also conscious and as she
thought as inconsistently of being pleased and even proud of his
success At the conclusion the applause was general and a voice added
with husky admiration and familiarity

Brayvo Johnny Walker

Twings face became suddenly white as a Pierrot mask There was a dead
silence in which the voice continued Give us Sugar in the Gourd
Johnny

A few hisses and cries of Hush Put him out followed Mrs Martin
raised her eyes quickly to where her assistant had stood bowing his
thanks a moment before He was gone

More concerned than she cared to confess vaguely fearful that she was
in some way connected with his abrupt withdrawal and perhaps a little
remorseful that she had allowed her personal feelings to interfere with
her frank recognition of his triumph she turned back to the schoolroom
after the little performers and their audience had departed in the hope
that he might return It was getting late the nearly level rays of the
sun were lying on the empty benches at the lower end of the room but
the desk where she sat with its lid raised was in deep shadow
Suddenly she heard his voice in a rear hall but it was accompanied by
anothersthe same voice which had interrupted the applause Before
she could either withdraw or make herself known the two men had
entered the room and were passing slowly through it She understood at
once that Twing had slipped out into a janitors room in the rear
where he had evidently forced an interview and explanation from his
interrupter and now had been waiting for the audience to disperse
before emerging by the front door They had evidently overlooked her in
the shadow

But said the stranger as if following an aggrieved line of apology
if Barstow knew who you were and what youd done and still thought
you good enough to rastle round here and square up them Pike County
fellers and them kidswhat in thunder do you care if the others DO find
you out as long as Barstow sticks to you

Ive told you why Dick returned Twing gloomily

Oh the schoolmaam

Yes shes a saint an angel More than thatshes a lady Dick
to the tip of her fingers who knows nothing of the world outside a
parsons study She took me on trustwithout a wordwhen the trustees
hung back and stared Shes never asked me about myself and now when
she knows who and what I have beenshell loathe me

But look here Jim said the stranger anxiously Ill say its all a
lie Ill come here and apologize to you afore HER and say I took you
for somebody else Ill

Its too late said Twing moodily

And whatll you do

Leave here

They had reached the door together To Mrs Martins terror as the
stranger passed out Twing instead of following him as she expected
said Goodnight and gloomily reentered the schoolroom Here he
paused a moment and then throwing himself on one of the benches
dropped his head upon a desk with his face buried in his handslike a
very schoolboy

What passed through Mrs Martins mind I know not For a moment she sat
erect and rigid at her desk Then she slipped quietly down and softly
as one of the last shadows cast by the dying sun glided across the
floor to where he sat

Mrs Martin he said starting to his feet

I have heard all she said faintly I couldnt help it I was here
when you came in But I want to tell you that I am content to know you
only as you seem to beas I have always found you herestrong and
loyal to a duty laid upon you by those who had a full knowledge of all
you had been

Did you Do you know what I have been

Mrs Martin looked frightened trembled a moment and recovering
herself with an effort said gently I know nothing of your past

Nothing he repeated with a mirthless attempt at laughter and a
quick breath Not that Ive been aamountebank a variety actora
clown you know for the amusement of the lowest at twentyfive cents a
ticket That Im Johnny Walker the song and dance manthe allround
manselected by Mr Barstow to teach these boors a lesson as to what
they wanted

She looked at him a momenttimidly yet thoughtfully Then you are an
actora person who simulates what he does not feel

Yes

And all the time you have been here you have been acting the
schoolmasterplaying a partforfor Mr Barstow

Yes

Always

Yes

The color came softly to her face again and her voice was very low
And when you sang to me that day and when you looked at meas
you didan hour or two agowhile you were entertainingyou
wereonlyacting

Mr Twings answer was not known but it must have been a full and
complete one for it was quite dark when he left the schoolroomNOT for
the last timewith its mistress on his arm




IN A PIONEER RESTAURANT


CHAPTER I


There was probably no earthly reason why the Poco Mas o Menos Club
of San Francisco should have ever existed or why its five harmless
indistinctive members should not have met and dined together as ordinary
individuals Still less was there any justification for the gratuitous
opinion which obtained that it was bold bad and brilliant Looking
back upon it over a quarter of a century and half a globe I confess I
cannot recall a single witticism audacity or humorous characteristic
that belonged to it Yet there was no doubt that we were thought to be
extremely critical and satirical and I am inclined to think we
honestly believed it To take our seats on Wednesdays and Saturdays at
a specially reserved table at the restaurant we patronized to be
conscious of being observed by the other guests and of our waiter
confidentially imparting our fame to strangers behind the shakenout
folds of a napkin and of knowing that the faintest indication of
merriment from our table thrilled the other guests with anticipatory
smiles was I am firmly convinced all that we ever did to justify our
reputations Nor strictly speaking were we remarkable as individuals
an assistant editor a lawyer a young army quartermaster a bank clerk
and a mining secretarywe could not separately challenge any special
social or literary distinction Yet I am satisfied that the very name
of our Cluba common Spanish colloquialism literally meaning a little
more or less and adopted in Californian slang to express an unknown
quantitywas supposed to be replete with deep and convulsing humor

My impression is that our extravagant reputation and indeed our
continued existence as a Club was due solely to the proprietor of the
restaurant and two of his waiters and that we were actually run
by them When the suggestion of our meeting regularly there was first
broached to the proprietora German of slow but deep emotionshe
received it with a So of such impressive satisfaction that it might
have been the beginning of our vainglory From that moment he became at
once our patron and our devoted slave To linger near our table once or
twice during dinner with an air of respectful vacuityas of one who
knew himself too well to be guilty of the presumption of attempting
to understand our brilliancyto wear a certain parental pride and
unconsciousness in our fame and yet to never go further in seeming to
comprehend it than to obligingly translate the name of the Club as a
leedle more and nod quide so muchwas to him sufficient happiness
That he ever experienced any business profit from the custom of the
Club or its advertisement may be greatly doubted on the contrary
that a few plain customers nettled at our selfsatisfaction might
have resented his favoritism seemed more probable Equally vague
disinterested and loyal was the attachment of the two waitersone
an Italian faintly reminiscent of better days and possibly superior
extraction the other a rough but kindly Western man who might have
taken this menial position from temporary stress of circumstances yet
who continued in it from sheer dominance of habit and some feebleness of
will They both vied with each other to please us It may have been they
considered their attendance upon a reputed intellectual company less
degrading than ministering to the purely animal and silent wants of
the average customers It may have been that they were attracted by
our general youthfulness Indeed I am inclined to think that they
themselves were much more distinctive and interesting than any members
of the Club and it is to introduce THEM that I venture to recall so
much of its history

A few months after our advent at the restaurant one evening Joe
Tallant the mining secretary one of our liveliest members was
observed to be awkward and distrait during dinner forgetting even to
offer the usual gratuity to the Italian waiter who handed him his hat
although he stared at him with an imbecile smile As we chanced to leave
the restaurant together I was rallying him upon his abstraction when
to my surprise he said gravely Look here one of two things has got to
happen either we must change our restaurant or Im going to resign

Why

Well to make matters clear Im obliged to tell you something that
in our business we usually keep a secret About three weeks ago I had
a notice to transfer twenty feet of Gold Hill to a fellow named
Tournelli Well Tournelli happened to call for it himself and who
the devil do you suppose Tournelli was Why our Italian waiter I was
regularly startled and so was he But business is business so I passed
him over the stock and said nothingnor did heneither there nor here
Day before yesterday he had thirty feet more transferred to him and
sold out

Well I said impatiently

Well repeated Tallant indignantly Gold Hills worth six hundred
dollars a foot Thats eighteen thousand dollars cash And a man whos
good enough for that much money is too good to wait upon me Fancy a man
who could pay my whole years salary with five feet of stock slinging
hash to ME Fancy YOU tipping him with a quarter

But if HE dont mind itand prefers to continue a waiterwhy should
YOU care And WERE not supposed to know

Thats just it groaned Tallant Thats just where the sell comes in
Think how he must chuckle over us No sir Theres nothing aristocratic
about me but by thunder if I cant eat my dinner and feel I am as
good as the man who waits on me Ill resign from the Club

After endeavoring to point out to him the folly of such a proceeding I
finally suggested that we should take the other members of our Club into
our confidence and abide by their decision to which he agreed But to
his chagrin the others far from participating in his delicacy seemed
to enjoy Tournellis unexpected wealth with a vicarious satisfaction
and increase of dignity as if we were personally responsible for
it Although it had been unanimously agreed that we should make no
allusions jocose or serious to him nor betray any knowledge of it
before him I am afraid our attitude at the next dinner was singularly
artificial A nervous expectancy when he approached us and a certain
restraint during his presence a disposition to check any discussion
of shares or strikes in mining lest he should think it personal an
avoidance of unnecessary or trifling orders and a singular patience
in awaiting their execution when given a vague hovering between
sympathetic respect and the other extreme of indifferent bluntness in
our requests tended I think to make that meal far from exhilarating
Indeed the unusual depression affected the unfortunate cause of it
who added to our confusion by increased solicitude of service andas if
fearful of some fault or having incurred our disfavorby a deprecatory
and exaggerated humility that in our sensitive state seemed like the
keenest irony At last evidently interpreting our constraint before him
into a desire to be alone he retired to the door of a distant pantry
whence he surveyed us with dark and sorrowful Southern eyes Tallant
who in this general embarrassment had been imperfectly served and had
eaten nothing here felt his grievance reach its climax and in a sudden
outbreak of recklessness he roared out Hi waiteryou Tournelli He
may he added turning darkly to us buy up enough stock to control
the board and dismiss ME but by thunder if it costs me my place Im
going to have some more chicken

It was probably this sensitiveness that kept us from questioning him
even indirectly and perhaps led us into the wildest surmises He was
acting secretly for a brotherhood or society of waiters he was a silent
partner of his German employer he was a disguised Italian stockbroker
gaining points from the unguarded conversation of operating
customers he was a political refugee with capital he was a fugitive
Sicilian bandit investing his illgotten gains in California he was
a dissipated young nobleman following some amorous intrigue across the
ocean and acting as his own Figaro or Leporello I think a majority of
us favored the latter hypothesis possibly because we were young and
his appearance gave it color His thin black mustaches and dark eyes
we felt were Tuscan and aristocratic at least they were like the
baritone who played those parts and HE ought to know Yet nothing could
be more exemplary and fastidious than his conduct towards the few lady
frequenters of the Poodle Dog restaurant who I regret to say were
not puritanically reserved or conventual in manner

But an unexpected circumstance presently changed and divided our
interest It was alleged by Clay the assistant editor that entering
the restaurant one evening he saw the back and tails of a coat that
seemed familiar to him halffilling a doorway leading to the restaurant
kitchen It was unmistakably the figure of one of our Club membersthe
young lawyerJack Manners But what was he doing there While the
Editor was still gazing after him he suddenly disappeared as if some
one had warned him that he was observed As he did not reappear when
Tournelli entered from the kitchen a few moments later the Editor
called him and asked for his fellowmember To his surprise the Italian
answered with every appearance of truthfulness that he had not seen
Mr Manners at all The Editor was staggered but as he chanced some
hours later to meet Manners he playfully rallied him on his mysterious
conference with the Italian Manners replied briefly that he had had no
interview whatever with Tournelli and changed the subject quickly The
mysteryas we persisted in believing itwas heightened when another
member deposed that he had seen Tom the Western waiter coming from
Mannerss office As Manners had volunteered no information of this we
felt that we could not without indelicacy ask him if Tom was a client
or a messenger from Tournelli The only result was that our Club dinner
was even more constrained than before Not only was Tom now invested
with a dark importance but it was evident that the harmony of the Club
was destroyed by these singular secret relations of two of its members
with their employes

It chanced that one morning arriving from a delayed journey I dropped
into the restaurant It was that slack hour between the lingering
breakfast and coming luncheon when the tables are partly stripped and
unknown doors opened for ventilation reveal the distant kitchen and a
mingled flavor of cold coffeegrounds and lukewarm soups hangs heavy
on the air To this cheerlessness was added a gusty rain without that
filmed the panes of the windows and doors and veiled from the passerby
the usual tempting display of snowy cloths and china

As I seemed to be the only customer at that hour I selected a table by
the window for distraction Tom had taken my order the other waiters
including Tournelli were absent with the exception of a solitary
German who in the interlude of perfunctory trifling with the casters
gazed at me with that abstracted irresponsibility which one waiter
assumes towards anothers customer Even the proprietor had deserted his
desk at the counter It seemed to be a favorable opportunity to get some
information from Tom

But he anticipated me When he had dealt a certain number of dishes
around me as if they were cards and he was telling my fortune he
leaned over the table and said with interrogating confidence

I reckon you call that Mr Manners of yours a good lawyer

We were very loyal to each other in the Club and I replied with
youthful enthusiasm that he was considered one of the most promising at
the bar And remembering Tournelli I added confidently that whoever
engaged him to look after their property interests had secured a
treasure

But is he good in criminal casesbefore a police court for instance
continued Tom

I believedI dont know on what groundsthat Manners was good in
insurance and admiralty law and that he looked upon criminal practice
as low but I answered brisklythough a trifle startledthat as a
criminal lawyer he was perfect

He could advise a man who had a row hanging on how to steer clear of
being up for murdereh

I trusted with a desperate attempt at jocosity that neither he nor
Tournelli had been doing anything to require Mannerss services in that
way

It would be too late THEN said Tom coolly and ANYBODY could tell
a man what he ought to have done or how to make the best of what he
had done but the smart thing in a lawyer would be to give a chap points
BEFOREHAND and sorter tell him how far he could go and yet keep
inside the law How he might goad a fellow to draw on him and then plug
himeh

I looked up quickly There was nothing in his ordinary goodhumored
but not very strong face to suggest that he himself was the subject of
this hypothetical case If he were speaking for Tournelli the Italian
certainly was not to be congratulated on his ambassadors prudence and
above all Manners was to be warned of the interpretation which might be
put upon his counsels and disseminated thus publicly As I was thinking
what to say he moved away but suddenly returned again

What made you think Tournelli had been up to anything he asked
sharply

Nothing I answered I only thought you and he being friends

You mean were both waiters in the same restaurant Well I dont know
him any better than I know that chap over there pointing to the other
waiter Hes a Greaser or an Italian and I reckon goes with his
kind

Why had we not thought of this before Nothing would be more natural
than that the rich and imperious Tournelli should be exclusive and have
no confidences with his enforced associates And it was evident that Tom
had noticed it and was jealous

I suppose hes rather a swell isnt he I suggested tentatively

A faint smile passed over Toms face It was partly cynical and partly
suggestive of that amused toleration of our youthful credulity which
seemed to be a part of that discomposing patronage that everybody
extended to the Club As he said nothing I continued encouragingly

Because a mans a waiter it doesnt follow that hes always been one
or always will be

No said Tom abstractedly but its about as good as anything else
to lie low and wait on But here two customers entered and he
turned to them leaving me in doubt whether to accept this as a verbal
pleasantry or an admission Only one thing seemed plain I had certainly
gained no information and only added a darker mystery to his conference
with Manners which I determined I should ask Manners to explain

I finished my meal in solitude The rain was still beating drearily
against the windows with an occasional accession of impulse that seemed
like human impatience Vague figures under dripping umbrellas that
hid their faces as if in premeditated disguise hurried from the main
thoroughfare A woman in a hooded waterproof like a domino a Mexican
in a black serape might have been stage conspirators hastening to a
rendezvous The cavernous chill and odor which I had before noted as
coming from some sarcophagus of larder or oven where funeral baked
meats might have been kept in stock began to oppress me The hollow
and fictitious domesticity of this common board had never before seemed
so hopelessly displayed And Tom the waiter his napkin twisted in
his hand and his face turned with a sudden dark abstraction towards the
window appeared to be really lying low and waiting for something
outside his avocation


CHAPTER II


The fact that Tom did not happen to be on duty at the next Club dinner
gave me an opportunity to repeat his mysterious remark to Manners and
to jokingly warn that rising young lawyer against the indiscretion of
vague counsel Manners however only shrugged his shoulders I dont
know what he meant he said carelessly but since he chooses to talk
of his own affairs publicly I dont mind saying that they are neither
very weighty nor very dangerous Its only the old story the usual
matrimonial infidelities that are mixed up with the Californian
emigration He leaves the regular wife behindfairly or unfairly I
cant say She gets tired waiting after the usual style and elopes
with somebody else The Western Penelope isnt built for waiting But
she seems to have converted some of his property into cash when she
skipped from St Louis and thats where his chief concern comes in
Thats what he wanted to see me for thats why he inveigled me into
that infernal pantry of his one day to show me a plan of his property
as if that was any good

He paused disgustedly We all felt I think that Tom was some kind of
an impostor claiming the sympathies of the Club on false pretenses
Nevertheless the Quartermaster said Then you didnt do anything for
himgive him any advice eh

No for the propertys as much hers as his and he hasnt got a
divorce and as its doubtful whether he didnt desert her first he
cant get one He was surprised he added with a grim smile when I
told him that he was obliged to support her and was even liable for
her debts But people who are always talking of invoking the law know
nothing about it We were surprised too although Manners was always
convincing us in some cheerful but discomposing way that we were all
daily and hourly in our simplest acts making ourself responsible
for all sorts of liabilities and actions and even generally preparing
ourselves for arrest and imprisonment The Quartermaster continued
lazily

Then you didnt give him any points about shooting

No he doesnt even know the man she went off with It was eighteen
months ago and I dont believe hed even know her again if he met
her But if he isnt much of a client we shall miss him tonight as
a waiter for the place is getting full and there are not enough to
serve

The restaurant was indeed unusually crowded that evening the more so
that the private rooms above being early occupied some dinner parties
and exclusive couples had been obliged to content themselves with the
public dining saloon A small table nearest us usually left vacant to
insure a certain seclusion to the Club was arranged with a deprecatory
apology from the proprietor for one of those couples a man and
woman The man was a wellknown speculatorcool yet reckless and
pleasureloving the woman goodlooking picturesquely attractive
selfconscious and selfpossessed Our propinquity was evidently
neither novel nor discomposing As she settled her skirts in her place
her bright dark eyes swept our table with a frank almost childish
familiarity The younger members of the Club quite unconsciously pulled
up their collars and settled their neckties the elders as unconsciously
raised their voices slightly and somewhat arranged their sentences
Alas the simplicity and unaffectedness of the Club were again invaded

Suddenly there was a crash the breaking of glass and an exclamation
Tournelli no doubt disorganized by the unusual hurry on his way to our
table had dropped his tray impartially distributed a plate of
asparagus over an adjoining table and flushed and nervous yet with
an affectation of studied calmness was pouring the sauce into the young
Quartermasters plate in spite of his languid protests At any other
time we would have laughed but there was something in the exaggerated
agitation of the Italian that checked our mirth Why should he be so
upset by a trifling accident He could afford to pay for the breakage
he would laugh at dismissal Was it the sensitiveness of a refined
nature orhe was young and goodlookingwas he disconcerted by the
fact that our handsome neighbor had witnessed his awkwardness But she
was not laughing and as far as I could see was intently regarding the
bill of fare

Waiter called her companion hailing Tournelli Here The Italian
with a face now distinctly white leaned over the table adjusting the
glasses but did not reply

Waiter repeated the stranger sharply Tournellis face twitched
then became set as a mask but he did not move The stranger leaned
forward and pulled his apron from behind Tournelli started with
flashing eyes and turned swiftly round But the Quartermasters hand
had closed on his wrist

Thats my knife Tournelli

The knife dropped from the Italians fingers

Better see WHAT he wants It may not be THAT said the young officer
coolly but kindly

Tournelli turned impatiently towards the stranger We alone had
witnessed this incident and were watching him breathlessly Yet what
bade fair a moment ago to be a tragedy seemed now to halt grotesquely
For Tournelli throwing open his linen jacket with a melodramatic
gesture tapped his breast and with flashing eyes and suppressed
accents said Sare you wantah me LookI am herre

The speculator leaned back in his chair in goodhumored astonishment
The ladys black eyes without looking at Tournelli glanced backward
round the room and slipped along our table with halfdefiant
unconcern and then she uttered a short hysterical laugh

Ah ze ladymadameze signoraehshe wantah me continued
Tournelli leaning on the table with compressed fingers and glaring at
her Perhaps SHE wantah Tournellieh

Well you might bring some with the soup blandly replied her escort
who seemed to enjoy the Italians excitement as a national eccentricity
but hurry up and set the table will you

Then followed on the authority of the Editor who understood Italian a
singular scene Secure apparently in his belief that his language was
generally uncomprehended Tournelli brought a decanter and setting
it on the table said Traitress in an intense whisper This
was followed by the cruets which he put down with the exclamation
Perjured fiend Two glasses placed on either side of her carried the
word Apostate to her ear and three knives and forks rattling
more than was necessary and laid crosswise before her plate were
accompanied with Tremble wanton Then as he pulled the tablecloth
straight and ostentatiously concealed a winestain with a clean napkin
scarcely whiter than his lips he articulated under his breath Let
him beware he goes not hence alive I will slice his craven
heartthusand thou shalt see it He turned quickly to a side table
and brought back a spoon And THIS is why I have not found you
another spoon For THIS you have disappeared a purely perfunctory
polishing of her fork For HIM bah an equally unnecessary wiping
of her glass Blood of Godmore wipingIt will end Yesgeneral
wiping and a final flourish over the whole table with a napkinI go
but at the door I shall await you both

She had not spoken yet nor even lifted her eyes When she did
so however she raised them level with his showed all her white
teeththey were small and cruellookingand said smilingly in his own
dialect

Thief

Tournelli halted rigid

Youre talking his lingo eh said her escort goodhumoredly

Yes

Welltell him to bustle around and be a little livelier with the
dinner wont you This is only skirmishing

You hear she continued to Tournelli in a perfectly even voice or
shall it be a policeman and a charge of stealing

Stealing gasped Tournelli YOU say stealing

Yesten thousand dollars You are well disguised here my little
fellow it is a good businessyours Keep it while you can

I think he would have sprung upon her there and then but that the
Quartermaster who was nearest him and had been intently watching his
face made a scarcely perceptible movement as if ready to anticipate
him He caught the officers eye caught I think in ours the
revelation that he had been understood drew back with a sidelong
sinuous movement and disappeared in the passage to the kitchen

I believe we all breathed more freely although the situation was still
full enough of impending possibilities to prevent peaceful enjoyment
of our dinner As the Editor finished his hurried translation it was
suggested that we ought to warn the unsuspecting escort of Tournellis
threats But it was pointed out that this would be betraying the woman
and that Jo Hays her companion was fully able to take care of himself
Besides said the Editor aggrievedly you fellows only think of
YOURSELVES and you dont understand the first principles of journalism
Do you suppose Im going to do anything to spoil a halfcolumn of leaded
brevier copyfrom an eyewitness too No its a square enough fight
as it stands We must look out for the woman and not let Tournelli get
an unfair drop on Hays That is if the whole thing isnt a bluff

But the Italian did not return Whether he had incontinently fled or
was nursing his wrath in the kitchen or already fulfilling his threat
of waiting on the pavement outside the restaurant we could not guess
Another waiter appeared with the dinners they had ordered A momentary
thrill of excitement passed over us at the possibility that Tournelli
had poisoned their soup but it presently lapsed as we saw the couple
partaking of it comfortably and chatting with apparent unconcern Was
the scene we had just witnessed only a piece of Southern exaggeration
Was the woman a creature devoid of nerves or feeling of any kind or was
she simply a consummate actress Yet she was clearly not acting for
in the intervals of conversation and even while talking her dark eyes
wandered carelessly around the room with the easy selfconfidence of
a pretty woman We were beginning to talk of something else when the
Editor said suddenly in a suppressed voice

Hullo Whats the matter now

The woman had risen and was hurriedly throwing her cloak over her
shoulders But it was HER face that was now ashen and agitated and we
could see that her hands were trembling Her escort was assisting her
but was evidently as astonished as ourselves Perhaps he suggested
hopefully if you wait a minute it will pass off

No no she gasped still hurriedly wrestling with her cloak Dont
you see Im suffocating hereI want air You can follow She began
to move off her face turned fixedly in the direction of the door We
instinctively looked thereperhaps for Tournelli There was no one
Nevertheless the Editor and Quartermaster had halfrisen from their
seats

Helloo said Manners suddenly Theres Tom just come in Call him

Tom evidently recalled from his brief furlough by the proprietor on
account of the press of custom had just made his appearance from the
kitchen

Tom wheres Tournelli asked the Lawyer hurriedly but following the
retreating woman with his eyes

Skipped they say Somebody insulted him said Tom curtly

You didnt see him hanging round outside eh Swearing vengeance
asked the Editor

No said Tom scornfully

The woman had reached the door and darted out of it as her escort
paused a moment at the counter to throw down a coin Yet in that moment
she had hurried before him through the passage into the street I
turned breathlessly to the window For an instant her face white as a
phantoms appeared pressed rigidly against the heavy plateglass her
eyes staring with a horrible fascination back into the roomI even
imagined at us Perhaps as it was evident that Tournelli was not with
her she fancied he was still here perhaps she had mistaken Tom for
him However her escort quickly rejoined her their shadows passed the
window togetherthey were gone

Then a pistolshot broke the quiet of the street

The Editor and Quartermaster rose and ran to the door Manners rose
also but lingered long enough to whisper to me Dont lose sight of
Tom and followed them But to my momentary surprise no one else
moved I had forgotten in the previous excitement that in those days
a pistolshot was not unusual enough to attract attention A few raised
their heads at the sound of running feet on the pavement and the
flitting of black shadows past the windows Tom had not stirred but
napkin in hand and eyes fixed on vacancy was standing as I had seen
him once before in an attitude of listless expectation

In a few minutes Manners returned I thought he glanced oddly at Tom
who was still lingering in attendance and I even fancied he talked to
us ostentatiously for his benefit Yes it was a row of Tournellis He
was waiting at the corner had rushed at Hays with a knife but had been
met with a derringershot through his hat The lady who it seems was
only a chance steamer acquaintance of Hays thought the attack must
have been meant for HER as she had recognized in the Italian a man who
had stolen from her divorced husband in the States two years ago and
was a fugitive from justice At least that was the explanation given by
Hays for the woman had fainted and been driven off to her hotel by
the Quartermaster and Tournelli had escaped But the Editor was on his
track You didnt notice that lady Tom did you

Tom came out of an abstracted study and said No she had her back to
me all the time

Manners regarded him steadily for a moment without speaking but in a
way that I could not help thinking was much more embarrassing to the
bystanders than to him When we rose to leave as he placed his usual
gratuity into Toms hand he said carelessly You might drop into my
office tomorrow if you have anything to tell ME

I havent said Tom quietly

Then I may have something to tell YOU

Tom nodded and turned away to his duties The Mining Secretary and
myself could scarcely wait to reach the street before we turned eagerly
on Manners

Well

Well the woman you saw was Toms runaway wife and Tournelli the man
she ran away with

And Tom knew it

Cant say

And you mean to say that all this while Tom never suspected HIM and
even did not recognize HER just now

Manners lifted his hat and passed his fingers through his hair
meditatively Ask me something easier gentlemen




A TREASURE OF THE GALLEON


Her fathers house was nearly a mile from the sea but the breath of
it was always strong at the windows and doors in the early morning and
when there were heavy southwesters blowing in the winter the wind
brought the sharp sting of sand to her cheek and the rain an odd taste
of salt to her lips On this particular December afternoon however as
she stood in the doorway it seemed to be singularly calm the southwest
trades blew but faintly and scarcely broke the crests of the long
Pacific swell that lazily rose and fell on the beach which only
a slanting copse of scruboak and willow hid from the cottage
Nevertheless she knew this leaguelong strip of shining sand much
better it is to be feared than the scanty flowergarden arid and
stunted by its contiguity It had been her playground when she first
came there a motherless girl of twelve and she had helped her father
gather its scattered driftwoodas the fortunes of the Millers were not
above accepting these occasional offerings of their lordly neighbor

I wouldnt go far today Jenny said her father as the girl stepped
from the threshold I dont trust the weather at this season and
besides you had better be looking over your wardrobe for the Christmas
Eve party at Sol Catlins

Why father you dont intend to go to that mans said the girl
looking up with a troubled face

Lawyer Miller as he was called by his few neighbors looked slightly
embarrassed Why not he asked in a faintly irritated tone

Why not Why father you know how vulgar and conceited he ishow
everybody here truckles to him

Very likely hes a very superior man of his kinda kind they
understand here tooa great trapper hunter and pioneer

But I dont believe in his trapping hunting and pioneering said
the girl petulantly I believe its all as hollow and boisterous as
himself Its no more real or what one thinks it should be than he
is And he dares to patronize youyou father an educated man and a
gentleman

Say rather an unsuccessful lawyer who was fool enough to believe that
buying a ranch could make him a farmer returned her father but half
jestingly I only wish I was as good at my trade as he is

But you never liked himyou always used to ignore him youve
changed fatherShe stopped suddenly for her recollection of her
fathers quiet superiority and easy independence when he first came
there was in such marked contrast to his late careless and weak
concession to the rude life around them that she felt a pang of vague
degradation which she feared her voice might betray

Very well Do as you like he replied with affected carelessness
only I thought as we cannot afford to go elsewhere this Christmas it
might be well for us to take what we could find here

Take what we could find here It was so unlike himhe who had always
been so strong in preserving their little domestic refinements in their
rude surroundings that their poverty had never seemed mean nor their
seclusion ignoble She turned away to conceal her indignant color She
could share the household work with a squaw and Chinaman she could
fetch wood and water Catlin had patronizingly seen her doing it but to
dance to his vulgar pipingnever

She was not long in reaching the sands that now lay before her
warm sweetscented from short beach grass stretching to a dim rocky
promontory and absolutely untrod by any foot but her own It was this
virginity of seclusion that had been charming to her girlhood fenced
in between the impenetrable hedge of scruboaks on the one side and the
lifting green walls of breakers tipped with chevaux de frise of white
foam on the other she had known a perfect security for her sports
and fancies that had captivated her townbred instincts and native
fastidiousness A few whitewinged seabirds as proud reserved and
maidenlike as herself had been her only companions And it was now
the custodian of her secreta secret as innocent and childlike as her
previous youthful fanciesbut still a secret known only to herself

One day she had come upon the rotting ribs of a wreck on the beach Its
distance from the tide line its position and its deep imbedding of
sand showed that it was of ancient origin An omnivorous reader of all
that pertained to the history of California Jenny had in fancy often
sailed the seas in one of those mysterious treasureships that had
skirted the coast in bygone days and she at once settled in her mind
that her discovery was none other than a castaway Philippine galleon
Partly from her reserve and partly from a suddenly conceived plan
she determined to keep its existence unknown to her father as careful
inquiry on her part had found it was equally unknown to the neighbors
For this shy imaginative young girl of eighteen had convinced herself
that it might still contain a part of its old treasure She would dig
for it herself without telling anybody If she failed no one would
know it if she were successful she would surprise her father and
perhaps retrieve their fortune by less vulgar means than their present
toil Thanks to the secluded locality and the fact that she was known
to spend her leisure moments in wandering there she could work without
suspicion Secretly conveying a shovel and a few tools to the spot the
next day she set about her prodigious task As the upper works were
gone and the galleon not large in three weeks working an hour or two
each day she had made a deep excavation in the stern She had found
many curious thingsthe flotsam and jetsam of previous stormsbut as
yet it is perhaps needless to say not the treasure

Today she was filled with the vague hope of making her discovery before
Christmas Day To have been able to take her father something on that
dayif only a few old coinsthe fruit of her own unsuspected labor and
intuitionnot the result of vulgar barter or menial wagewould have
been complete happiness It was perhaps a somewhat visionary expectation
for an educated girl of eighteen but I am writing of a young
Californian girl who had lived in the fierce glamour of
treasurehunting and in whose sensitive individuality some of its
subtle poison had been instilled Howbeit today she found nothing
She was sadly hiding her pick and shovel as was her custom when she
discovered the fresh track of an alien foot in the sand Robinson Crusoe
was not more astounded at the savage footprint than Jenny Miller at this
damning proof of the invasion of her sacred territory The footprints
came from and returned to the copse of shrubs Some one might have seen
her at work

But a singular change in the weather overlooked in her excitement here
forced itself upon her A light film over sea and sky lifted only by
fitful gusts of wind seemed to have suddenly thickened until it became
an opaque vault narrowing in circumference as the wind increased The
promontory behind her disappeared as if swallowed up the distance
before her seemed to contract the ocean at her side the color of
dull pewter vanished in a sheet of slanting rain and by the time she
reached the house half running half carried along by the quartering
force of the wind a full gale was blowing

It blew all the evening reaching a climax and fury at past midnight
that was remembered for many years along that coast In the midst of it
they heard the booming of cannon and then the voices of neighbors in
the road There was said the voices a big steamer ashore just afore
the house They dressed quickly and ran out

Hugging the edge of the copse to breathe and evade the fury of the wind
they struggled to the sands At first looking out to sea the girl saw
nothing but foam But following the direction of a neighbors arm for
in that wild tumult man alone seemed speechless she saw directly before
her so close upon her that she could have thrown a pebble on board the
high bows of a ship Indeed its very nearness gave her the feeling that
it was already saved and its occasional heavy roll to leeward drunken
helpless ludicrous but never awful brought a hysteric laugh to her
lips But when a livid blue light lit in the swinging top showed a
number of black objects clinging to bulwarks and rigging and the sea
with languid heavy cruelty pushing rather than beating them away one
by one she knew that Death was there

The neighbors her father with the others had been running hopelessly
to and fro or cowering in groups against the copse when suddenly they
uttered a crytheir firstof joyful welcome And with that shout
the man she most despised and hated Sol Catlin mounted on a calico
mustang as outrageous and bizarre as himself dashed among them

In another moment what had been fear bewilderment and hesitation
was changed to courage confidence and action The men pressed eagerly
around him and as eagerly dispersed under his quick command Galloping
at his heels was a team with the whaleboat brought from the river
miles away He was here there and everywhere catching the line thrown
by the rocket from the ship marshaling the men to haul it in answering
the hail from those on board above the tempest pervading everything
and everybody with the fury of the storm loud imperious domineering
selfasserting allsufficient and successful And when the boat was
launched the last mighty impulse came from his shoulder He rode at the
helm into the first hanging wall of foam erect and triumphant Dazzled
bewildered crying and laughing she hated him more than ever

The boat made three trips bringing off with the aid of the hawser
all but the sailors she had seen perish before her own eyes The
passengersthey were fewthe captain and officers found refuge in
her fathers house and were loud in their praises of Sol Catlin But
in that grateful chorus a single gloomy voice arose the voice of a
wealthy and troubled passenger I will give he said five thousand
dollars to the man who brings me a box of securities I left in my
stateroom Every eye turned instinctively to Sol he answered only
those of Jennys Say ten thousand and if the dodblasted hulk holds
together two hours longer Ill do it dn me You hear me My names
Sol Catlin and when I say a thing by Gd I do it Jennys disgust
here reached its climax The hero of a night of undoubted energy and
courage had blotted it out in a single moment of native vanity and
vulgar avarice

He was gone not only two hours but daylight had come and they
were eagerly seeking him when he returned among them dripping
andemptyhanded He had reached the ship he said with another found
the box and trusted himself alone with it to the sea But in the surf
he had to abandon it to save himself It had perhaps drifted ashore and
might be found for himself he abandoned his claim to the reward Had
he looked abashed or mortified Jenny felt that she might have relented
but the braggart was as allsatisfied as confident and boastful as
ever Nevertheless as his eye seemed to seek hers she was constrained
in mere politeness to add her own to her fathers condolences I
suppose she hesitated in passing him that this is a mere nothing
to you after all that you did last night that was really great and
unselfish

Were you never disappointed Miss he said with exasperating
abruptness

A quick consciousness of her own thankless labor on the galleon and
a terrible idea that he might have some suspicion of and perhaps the
least suggestion that she might have been disappointed in him brought a
faint color to her cheek But she replied with dignity

I really couldnt say But certainly she added with a newfound
pertness you dont look it

Nor do you Miss was his idiotic answer

A few hours later alarmed at what she had heard of the inroads of the
sea which had risen higher than ever known to the oldest settler and
perhaps mindful of yesterdays footprints she sought her old secluded
haunt The wreck was still there but the sea had reached it The
excavation between its gaunt ribs was filled with drift and the seaweed
carried there by the surges and entrapped in its meshes And there too
caught as in a net lay the wooden box of securities Sol Catlin had
abandoned to the sea

This is the story as it was told to me The singularity of coincidences
has challenged some speculation Jenny insisted at the time upon sharing
the full reward with Catlin but local critics have pointed out that
from subsequent events this proved nothing For she had married him




OUT OF A PIONEERS TRUNK


It was a slightly cynical but fairly goodhumored crowd that had
gathered before a warehouse on Long Wharf in San Francisco one afternoon
in the summer of 51 Although the occasion was an auction the bidders
chances more than usually hazardous and the season and locality famous
for reckless speculation there was scarcely any excitement among the
bystanders and a lazy halfhumorous curiosity seemed to have taken the
place of any zeal for gain

It was an auction of unclaimed trunks and boxesthe personal luggage of
early emigrantswhich had been left on storage in hulk or warehouse at
San Francisco while the owner was seeking his fortune in the mines The
difficulty and expense of transport often obliging the goldseeker
to make part of his journey on foot restricted him to the smallest
impedimenta and that of a kind not often found in the luggage of
ordinary civilization As a consequence during the emigration of
49 he was apt on landing to avail himself of the invitation usually
displayed on some of the doors of the rude hostelries on the shore
Rest for the Weary and Storage for Trunks In a majority of cases
he never returned to claim his stored property Enforced absence
protracted equally by good or evil fortune accumulated the high storage
charges until they usually far exceeded the actual value of the goods
sickness further emigration or death also reduced the number of
possible claimants and that more wonderful human frailtyabsolute
forgetfulness of deposited possessionscombined together to leave
the bulk of the property in the custodians hands Under an understood
agreement they were always sold at public auction after a given time
Although the contents of some of the trunks were exposed it was found
more in keeping with the public sentiment to sell the trunks LOCKED and
UNOPENED The element of curiosity was kept up from time to time by the
incautious disclosures of the lucky or unlucky purchaser and general
bidding thus encouragedexcept when the speculator with the true
gambling instinct gave no indication in his face of what was drawn in
this lottery Generally however some suggestion in the exterior of
the trunk a label or initials some conjectural knowledge of its former
owner or the idea that he might be secretly present in the hope of
getting his property back for less than the accumulated dues kept up
the bidding and interest

A modestlooking wellworn portmanteau had been just put up at a
small opening bid when Harry Flint joined the crowd The young man had
arrived a week before at San Francisco friendless and penniless and had
been forced to part with his own effects to procure necessary food
and lodging while looking for an employment In the irony of fate that
morning the proprietors of a drygoods store struck with his good looks
and manners had offered him a situation if he could make himself
more presentable to their fair clients Harry Flint was gazing half
abstractedly half hopelessly at the portmanteau without noticing the
auctioneers persuasive challenge In his abstraction he was not aware
that the auctioneers assistant was also looking at him curiously and
that possibly his dejected and halfclad appearance had excited the
attention of one of the cynical bystanders who was exchanging a few
words with the assistant He was however recalled to himself a moment
later when the portmanteau was knocked down at fifteen dollars and
considerably startled when the assistant placed it at his feet with a
grim smile Thats your property Fowler and I reckon you look as if
you wanted it back bad

Buttheres some mistake stammered Flint I didnt bid

No but Tom Flynn did for you You see I spotted you from the first
and told Flynn I reckoned you were one of those chaps who came back from
the mines dead broke And he up and bought your things for youlike a
square man Thats Flynns style if he is a gambler

But persisted Flint this never was my property My name isnt
Fowler and I never left anything here

The assistant looked at him with a grim halfcredulous halfscornful
smile Have it your own way he said but I oughter tell ye old
man that Im the warehouse clerk and I remember YOU Im here for that
purpose But as that thar valise is bought and paid for by somebody else
and given to you its nothing more to me Take it or leave it

The ridiculousness of quarreling over the mere form of his good fortune
here struck Flint and as his abrupt benefactor had as abruptly
disappeared he hurried off with his prize Reaching his cheap
lodginghouse he examined its contents As he had surmised it
contained a full suit of clothing of the better sort and suitable to
his urban needs There were a few articles of jewelry which he put
religiously aside There were some letters which seemed to be of a
purely business character There were a few daguerreotypes of pretty
faces one of which was singularly fascinating to him But there
was another of a young man which startled him with its marvelous
resemblance to HIMSELF In a flash of intelligence he understood it all
now It was the likeness of the former owner of the trunk for whom
the assistant had actually mistaken him He glanced hurriedly at the
envelopes of the letters They were addressed to Shelby Fowler the name
by which the assistant had just called him The mystery was plain now
And for the present he could fairly accept his good luck and trust to
later fortune to justify himself

Transformed in his new garb he left his lodgings to present himself
once more to his possible employer His way led past one of the large
gambling saloons It was yet too early to find the drygoods trader
disengaged perhaps the consciousness of more decent civilized garb
emboldened him to mingle more freely with strangers and he entered the
saloon He was scarcely abreast of one of the faro tables when a man
suddenly leaped up with an oath and discharged a revolver full in his
face The shot missed Before his unknown assailant could fire again
the astonished Flint had closed with him and instinctively clutched
the weapon A brief but violent struggle ensued Flint felt his strength
failing him when suddenly a look of astonishment came into the furious
eyes of his adversary and the mans grasp mechanically relaxed The
halffreed pistol thrown upwards by this movement was accidentally
discharged point blank into his temples and he fell dead No one in the
crowd had stirred or interfered

Youve done for Australian Pete this time Mr Fowler said a voice
at his elbow He turned gaspingly and recognized his strange benefactor
Flynn I call you all to witness gentlemen continued the gambler
turning dictatorially to the crowd that this man was FIRST attacked
and was UNARMED He lifted Flints limp and empty hands and then
pointed to the dead man who was still grasping the weapon Come He
caught the halfparalyzed arm of Flint and dragged him into the street

But stammered the horrified Flint as he was borne along what does
it all mean What made that man attack me

I reckon it was a case of shooting on sight Mr Fowler but he missed
it by not waiting to see if you were armed It wasnt the square thing
and youre all right with the crowd now whatever he might have had
agin you

But protested the unhappy Flint I never laid eyes on the man
before and my name isnt Fowler

Flynn halted and dragged him in a door way Who the devil are you he
asked roughly

Briefly passionately almost hysterically Flint told him his scant
story An odd expression came over the gamblers face

Look here he said abruptly I have passed my word to the crowd
yonder that you are a deadbroke miner called Fowler I allowed that you
might have had some row with that Sydney duck Australian Pete in the
mines That satisfied them If I go back now and say its a lie that
your name aint Fowler and you never knew who Pete was theyll jest
pass you over to the police to deal with you and wash their hands of it
altogether You may prove to the police who you are and how that d
clerk mistook you but it will give you trouble And who is there here
who knows who you really are

No one said Flint with sudden hopelessness

And you say youre an orphan and aint got any relations livin that
youre beholden to

No one

Then take my advice and BE Fowler and stick to it Be Fowler until
Fowler turns up and thanks you for it for youve saved Fowlers life
as Pete would never have funked and lost his grit over Fowler as he did
with you and youve a right to his name

He stopped and the same odd superstitious look came into his dark
eyes

Dont you see what all that means Well Ill tell you Youre in the
biggest streak of luck a man ever had Youve got the cards in your own
hand They spell Fowler Play Fowler first last and all the time
Goodnight and good luck MR FOWLER

The next mornings journal contained an account of the justifiable
killing of the notorious desperado and exconvict Australian Pete by
a courageous young miner by the name of Fowler An act of firmness
and daring said the Pioneer which will go far to counteract the
terrorism produced by those lawless ruffians

In his new suit of clothes and with this paper in his hand Flint
sought the drygoods proprietorthe latter was satisfied and convinced
That morning Harry Flint began his career as salesman and as Shelby
Fowler


From that day Shelby Fowlers career was one of uninterrupted
prosperity Within the year he became a partner The same miraculous
fortune followed other ventures later He was mill owner mine owner
bank directora millionaire He was popular the reputation of his
brief achievement over the desperado kept him secure from the attack of
envy and rivalry He never was confronted by the real Fowler There was
no danger of exposure by othersthe one custodian of his secret Tom
Flynn died in Nevada the year following He had quite forgotten his
youthful past and even the more recent lucky portmanteau remembered
nothing perhaps but the pretty face of the daguerreotype that had
fascinated him There seemed to be no reason why he should not live and
die as Shelby Fowler

His business a year later took him to Europe He was entering a train
at one of the great railway stations of London when the porter who
had just deposited his portmanteau in a compartment reappeared at the
window followed by a young lady in mourning

Beg pardon sir but I handed you the wrong portmanteau That belongs
to this young lady This is yours

Flint glanced at the portmanteau on the seat before him It certainly
was not his although it bore the initials S F He was mechanically
handing it back to the porter when his eyes fell on the young ladys
face For an instant he stood petrified It was the face of the
daguerreotype I beg pardon he stammered but are these your
initials She hesitated perhaps it was the abruptness of the question
but he saw she looked confused

No A friends

She disappeared into another carriage but from that moment Harry Flint
knew that he had no other aim in life but to follow this clue and the
beautiful girl who had dropped it He bribed the guard at the next
station and discovered that she was going to York On their arrival
he was ready on the platform to respectfully assist her A few words
disclosed the fact that she was a fellowcountrywoman although residing
in England and at present on her way to join some friends at Harrogate
Her name was West At the mention of his he again fancied she looked
disturbed

They met again and again the informality of his introduction was
overlooked by her friends as his assumed name was already respectably
and responsibly known beyond California He thought no more of his
future He was in love He even dared to think it might be returned but
he felt he had no right to seek that knowledge until he had told her his
real name and how he came to assume anothers He did so alonescarcely
a month after their first meeting To his alarm she burst into a flood
of tears and showed an agitation that seemed far beyond any apparent
cause When she had partly recovered she said in a low frightened
voice

You are bearing MY BROTHERS name But it was a name that the unhappy
boy had so shamefully disgraced in Australia that he abandoned it and
as he lay upon his deathbed the last act of his wasted life was
to write an imploring letter begging me to change mine too For the
infamous companion of his crime who had first tempted then betrayed
him had possession of all his papers and letters many of them from ME
and was threatening to bring them to our Virginia home and expose him
to our neighbors Maddened by desperation the miserable boy twice
attempted the life of the scoundrel and might have added that blood
guiltiness to his other sins had he lived I DID change my name to my
mothers maiden one left the country and have lived here to escape the
revelations of that desperado should he fulfill his threat

In a flash of recollection Flint remembered the startled look that had
come into his assailants eye after they had clinched It was the same
man who had too late realized that his antagonist was not Fowler Thank
God you are forever safe from any exposure from that man he said
gravely and the name of Fowler has never been known in San Francisco
save in all respect and honor It is for you to take backfearlessly
and alone

She didbut not alone for she shared it with her husband




THE GHOSTS OF STUKELEY CASTLE


There should have been snow on the ground to make the picture seasonable
and complete but the Western Barbarian had lived long enough in England
to know that except in the pages of a holiday supplement this was
rarely the accompaniment of a Christmas landscape and he cheerfully
accepted on the 24th of December the background of a low brooding
sky on which the delicate tracery of leafless sprays and blacker
chevaux de frise of pine was faintly etched as a consistent setting
to the turrets and peacefully stacked chimneys of Stukeley Castle Yet
even in this disastrous eclipse of color and distance the harmonious
outlines of the long gray irregular pile seemed to him as wonderful
as ever It still dominated the whole landscape and as he had often
fancied carried this subjection even to the human beings who had
created it lived in it but which it seemed to have in some dull
senile way dozed over and forgotten He vividly recalled the previous
sunshine of an autumnal house party within its walls where some
descendants of its old castellans encountered in long galleries or at
the very door of their bedrooms looked as alien to the house as the
Barbarian himself

For the rest it may be found described in the local guidebooks with a
view of its South Front West Front and Great Quadrangle It
was alleged to be based on an encampment of the Romansthat highly
apocryphal race who seemed to have spent their time in getting up
picnics on tessellated pavements where after hilariously emptying
their pockets of their loose coin and throwing round their dishes they
instantly built a road to escape by leaving no other record of their
existence Stow and Dugdale had recorded the date when a Norman favorite
obtained the royal license to embattle it it had done duty on
Christmas cards with the questionable snow already referred to laid
on thickly in crystal it had been lovingly portrayed by a fair
countrywomanthe vivacious correspondent of the East Machias
Sentinelin a combination of the most delightful feminine disregard
of facts with the highest feminine respect for titles It was rich in a
real and spiritual estate of tapestries paintings armor legends and
ghosts Everything the poet could wish for and indeed some things that
decent prose might have possibly wished out of it were there

Yet from the day that it had been forcibly seized by a Parliamentary
General until more recently when it had passed by the no less
desperate conveyance of marriage into the hands of a Friendly Nobleman
known to the Western Barbarian it had been supposed to suggest
something or other more remarkable than itself Few spectators said
the guidebook even the most unimpassioned can stand in the courtyard
and gaze upon those historic walls without feeling a thrill of awe
etc The Western Barbarian had stood there gazed and felt no thrill
The privileged guest said the grave historian passing in review the
lineaments of the illustrious owners of Stukeley as he slowly paces the
sombre gallery must be conscious of emotions of no ordinary character
etc etc The Barbarian had been conscious of no such emotions And
it was for this reason and believing he MIGHT experience them if left
there in solitude with no distracting or extraneous humanity around
him it had been agreed between him and the Friendly Nobleman who had
fine Barbarian instincts that as hethe Friendly Noblemanand his
family were to spend their holidays abroad the Barbarian should be
allowed on the eve and day of Christmas to stay at Stukeley alone
But added his host youll find it beastly lonely and although Ive
told the housekeeper to look after youyoud better go over to dine at
Audley Friars where theres a big party and they know you and it will
be a deuced deal more amusing AnderI sayyou knowyoure really
NOT looking out for ghosts and that sort of thing are you You know
you fellows dont believe in themover there And the Barbarian
assuring him that this was a part of his deficient emotions it was
settled then and there that he should come And that was why on the
24th of December the Barbarian found himself gazing hopefully on the
landscape with his portmanteau at his feet as he drove up the avenue

The ravens did NOT croak ominously from the battlements as he entered
And the housekeeper although neither stately nor tall nor full
of reminiscences of his late lordship the present Earls father was
very sensible and practical The Barbarian could of course have his
choice of roomsbutshe had thoughtremembering his tastes the last
time that the long blue room Exactly The long lowarched room
with the faded blue tapestry looking upon the gallerycapital He
had always liked that room From purely negative evidence he had every
reason to believe that it was the one formidablelooking room in England
that Queen Elizabeth had not slept in

When the footman had laid out his clothes and his step grew fainter
along the passage until it was suddenly swallowed up with the
closing of a red baize door in the turret staircase like a trap in an
oubliette the whole building seemed to sink back into repose Quiet it
certainly was but not more so he remembered than when the chambers on
either side were filled with guests and floating voices in the corridor
were lost in those allabsorbing walls So far certainly this was no
new experience It was past four He waited for the shadows to gather
Light thickened beyond his windows gradually the outflanking wall and
part of a projecting terrace crumbled away in the darkness as if Night
were slowly reducing the castle The figures on the tapestry in his room
stood out faintly The gallery seen through his open door barred
with black spaces between the mullioned windows presently became
obliterated as if invaded by a dull smoke from without But nothing
moved nothing glimmered Really this might become in time very stupid

He was startled however while dressing to see from his windows that
the great banqueting hall was illuminated but on coming down was amused
to find his dinner served on a small table in its oaken solitude lit
by the large electric chandelierfor Stukeley Castle under its present
lord had all the modern improvementsshining on the tattered banners
and glancing mail above him It was evidently the housekeepers reading
of some written suggestion of her noble master The Barbarian in a
flash of instinct imagined the passage

Humor him as a harmless lunatic the plate is quite safe

Declining the further offer of an illumination of the picture gallery
grand drawingroom ballroom and chapel a few hours later he found
himself wandering in the corridor with a single candle and a growing
conviction of the hopelessness of his experiment The castle had as yet
yielded to him nothing that he had not seen before in the distraction of
company and the garishness of day It was becoming a trifle monotonous
Yet fineexceedingly and now that a change of wind had lifted the
fog and the full moon shone on the lower half of the pictures of the
gallery starting into the most artificial simulation of life a number
of Van Dyke legs farthingales and fingers that would have deceived
nobody it seemed gracious gentle and innocent beyond expression
Wandering down the gallery conscious of being more like a ghost than
any of the painted figures and that they might reasonably object to
him he wished he could meet the original of one of those pictured
gallants and secretly compare his fingers with the copy He remembered
an embroidered pair of gloves in a cabinet and a suit of armor on the
wall that in measurement did not seem to bear out the delicacy of the
one nor the majesty of the other It occurred to him also to satisfy a
yearning he had once felt to try on a certain breastplate and steel cap
that hung over an oaken settle It will be perceived that he was getting
a good deal bored For thus caparisoned he listlessly and as will
be seen imprudently allowed himself to sink back into a very modern
chair and give way to a dreamy cogitation

What possible interest could the dead have in anything that was here
Admitting that they had any and that it was not the LIVING whom the
Barbarian had always found most inclined to haunt the past would not
a ghost of any decided convictions object to such a collection as his
descendant had gathered in this gallery Yonder idiot in silk and steel
had blunderingly and cruelly persecuted his kinsman in leather and steel
only a few panels distant Would they care to meet here And if their
human weaknesses had died with them what would bring them here at all
And if not THEMwho then He stopped short The door at the lower end
of the gallery had opened Not stealthily not noiselessly but in an
ordinary fashion and a number of figures dressed in the habiliments of
a bygone age came trooping in They did not glide in nor float in but
trampled in awkwardly clumsily and unfamiliarly gaping about them as
they walked At the head was apparently a steward in a kind of livery
who stopped once or twice and seemed to be pointing out and explaining
certain objects in the room A flash of indignant intelligence filled
the brain of the Barbarian It seemed absurdimpossiblebut it
was true It was a holiday excursion party of ghosts being shown over
Stukeley Castle by a ghostly Cicerone And as his measured monotonous
voice rose on the Christmas morning air it could be heard that he was
actually showing off not the antiquities of the Castle but the MODERN
IMPROVEMENTS

This ere gossipsthe Barbarian instantly detected the fallacy of
all the socalled mediaeval jargon he had readis the Helectric
Bell which does away with our hold hordinary orn blowin and the
hattendant waitin in the all for the usual Without there who waits
which all of us was accustomed to in mortal flesh You hobserve this
button I press it so and it instantly rings a bell in the kitchen
all and shows in fair letters the name of this ere galleryas we
will see later Will hany good dame or gaffer press the button Will

said the Cicerone severely which is a mere toy for infants and
holdfashioned And we have ere a much later invention I open this
little door I turn this andlecalled a switchand has you perceive
the gallery is hinstantly hilluminated

There was a hoarse cry of astonishment from the assemblage The
Barbarian felt an awful thrill as this searching insufferable light
of the nineteenth century streamed suddenly upon the upturned
vacanteyed and dull faces of those sightseers of the past But there
was no responsive gleam in their eyes

It be the sun gasped an old woman in a gray cloak

Toime to rouse out Myryan and make the foire said the mediaeval
Arry The custodian smiled with superior toleration

But what do ee want o my old lanthorne asked a yellowjerkined
stable boy pointing to an oldfashioned horned lantern tempus Edward

mortals worship what they call curios and the antique and is
lordship gave a matter of fifty pounds for that same lanthern Thats
what the modern folk come ere to seelike as ye

Oive an old threelegged stool in Whitechapel oill let his lordship
ave cheapfor five quid suggested the humorist

The prentice wight knows not that he speaks truly For ere is a
braver jest than is Good folks wilt please ye to examine yon coffer
pointing to an oaken chest

Tis but poor stuff marry said Maudlin

Tis a cofferthe same being made in Wardour Street last yearis
lordship gave one hundred pounds for it Look at these wouldbe
wormholesbut they were made with an AUGER Marry WE know what
wormholes are

A ghastly grin spread over the faces of the spectral assembly as they
gathered around the chest with silent laughter

Wilt walk ere and see the phonograph in the libry made by Hedison
an Hamerican which bottles up the voice and preserves it fresh for a
hundred years Tis a rare new fancy

Rot said Arry Then turning to the giggling Maudlin he whispered
Saw it las toime Is lordship got a piece o moy moind that oi
reeled off into it about this ere swindle Fawney that old bloke there
charging a tanner apiece to us for chaffin a bit of a barrel

Have you no last new braveries to show us of the gallants and their
mistresses as you were wont said Maudlin to the Cicerone Twas
a rare show last timethe modish silk gowns and farthingales in the
closets

But there be no company this Christmas said the custodian and is
lordship does not entertain unless it be the new fool is lordship sent
down ere today who has been mopin and moonin in the corridors as
is ever the way of these wittol creatures when they are not heeded He
was ere in a rare motley of his own choosing with which he thinks to
raise a laugh a moment ago Ye see him notnot avin the gift that
belongs by right to my dread office Tis a weird privilege I haveand
may not be imparted to otherssave

Save what good man steward Prithee speak said Marian earnestly

Tis ever a shillin extra

There was no response A few of the more bashful ghosts thrust their
hands in their pockets and looked awkwardly another way The Barbarian
felt a momentary relief followed by a slight pang of mortified vanity
He was a little afraid of them The price was an extortion certainly
but surely he was worth the extra shilling

He has brought but little braveries of attire into the Castle
continued the Cicerone but I ave something ere which was found on
the top of his portmanteau I wot ye know not the use of this To the
Barbarians intense indignation the Cicerone produced from under his
his the Barbarians own opera hat Marry what should be this Read
me this riddle To itand unyoke

A dozen vacant guesses were made as the showman held it aloft Then
with a conjurors gesture he suddenly placed his thumbs within the rim
released the spring and extended the hat The assembly laughed again
silently as before

Tis a hat said the Cicerone with a superior air

Nay said Maudlin give it here She took it curiously examined
it and then with a sudden coquettish movement lifted it towards her own
coifed head as if to try it on The Cicerone suddenly sprang forward
with a despairing gesture to prevent her And here the Barbarian was
conscious of a more startling revelation How and why he could not tell
but he KNEW that the putting on of that article of his own dress would
affect the young girl as the assumption of the steel cap and corselet
had evidently affected him and that he would instantly become as
visible to her as she and her companions had been to him He attempted
to rise but was too late she had evaded the Cicerone by ducking and
facing in the direction of the Barbarian clapped the hat on her head
He saw the swift light of consciousness of astonishment of sudden fear
spring into her eyes She shrieked he started struggled and awoke

But what was this He was alone in the moonlit gallery certainly the
ghastly figures in their outlandish garb were gone he was awake and
in his senses but in this first flash of real consciousness he could
have sworn that something remained Something terrorstricken and
retreating even then before himsomething of the world modernand
even as he gazed vanishing through the gallery door with the material
flash and rustle of silk

He walked quietly to the door It was open Ah No doubt he had
forgotten to shut it fast a current of air or a sudden draught had
opened it That noise had awakened him More than that remembering the
lightning flash of dream consciousness it had been the CAUSE of his
dream Yet for a few moments he listened attentively

What might have been the dull reverberation of a closing door in the
direction of the housekeepers room on the lower story was all he
heard He smiled for even that natural as it might be was less
distinct and real than his absurd vision

Nevertheless the next afternoon he concluded to walk over to Audley
Friars for his Christmas dinner Its hospitable master greeted him
cordially

But do you know my dear fellow he said when they were alone for
a moment if you hadnt come by yourself Id have sent over there for
you The fact is that A wrote to us that you were down at Stukeley
alone ghosthunting or something of that sort and Im afraid it leaked
out among the young people of our party Two of our girlsI shant tell
you whichstole over there last night to give you a start of some kind
They didnt see you at all but by Jove it seems they got the biggest
kind of a fright THEMSELVES for they declare that something dreadful in
armor you know was sitting in the gallery Awfully good joke wasnt
it Of course YOU didnt see anythingdid you

No said the Barbarian discreetly
