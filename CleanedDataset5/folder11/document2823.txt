GEORGE FITZBOODLE ESQUIRE TO OLIVER YORKE ESQUIRE


OMNIUM CLUB May 20 1842


DEAR SIRI have always been considered the thirdbest whistplayer in
Europe and though never betting more than five pounds have for many
years past added considerably to my yearly income by my skill in the
game until the commencement of the present season when a French
gentleman Monsieur Lalouette was admitted to the club where I usually
play His skill and reputation were so great that no men of the club
were inclined to play against us two of a side and the consequence has
been that we have been in a manner pitted against one another By a
strange turn of luck for I cannot admit the idea of his superiority
Fortune since the Frenchmans arrival has been almost constantly
against me and I have lost twoandthirty nights in the course of a
couple of score of nights play

  The FitzBoodle Papers first appeared in Frasers
 Magazine for the year 1842

Everybody knows that I am a poor man and so much has Lalouettes luck
drained my finances that only last week I was obliged to give him that
famous gray cob on which you have seen me riding in the Park I cant
afford a thoroughbred and hate a cocktailI was I say forced to
give him up my cob in exchange for four ponies which I owed him Thus
as I never walk being a heavy man whom nobody cares to mount my time
hangs heavily on my hands and as I hate home or that apology for
ita bachelors lodgingsand as I have nothing earthly to do now until
I can afford to purchase another horse I spend my time in sauntering
from one club to another passing many rather listless hours in them
before the men come in

You will say Why not take to backgammon or ecarte or amuse yourself
with a book Sir putting out of the question the fact that I do not
play upon credit I make a point never to play before candles are
lighted and as for books I must candidly confess to you I am not a
reading man

Twas but the other day that some one recommended me to your Magazine
after dinner saying it contained an exceedingly witty article uponI
forget what I give you my honor sir that I took up the work at six
meaning to amuse myself till seven when Lord Trumpingtons dinner was
to come off and egad in two minutes I fell asleep and never woke till
midnight Nobody ever thought of looking for me in the library where
nobody ever goes and so ravenously hungry was I that I was obliged to
walk off to Crockfords for supper

What is it that makes you literary persons so stupid I have met various
individuals in society who I was told were writers of books and that
sort of thing and expecting rather to be amused by their conversation
have invariably found them dull to a degree and as for information
without a particle of it Sir I actually asked one of these fellows
What was the nick to seven and he stared in my face and said he
didnt know He was hugely overdressed in satin rings chains and
so forth and at the beginning of dinner was disposed to be rather
talkative and pert but my little sally silenced HIM I promise you
and got up a good laugh at his expense too Leave George alone
said little Lord Cinqbars I warrant hell be a match for any of
you literary fellows Cinqbars is no great wiseacre but indeed it
requires no great wiseacre to know THAT

What is the simple deduction to be drawn from this truth Why
thisthat a man to be amusing and wellinformed has no need of
books at all and had much better go to the world and to men for his
knowledge There was Ulysses now the Greek fellow engaged in the
Trojan war as I dare say you know well he was the cleverest man
possible and how From having seen men and cities their manners noted
and their realms surveyed to be sure So have I I have been in every
capital and can order a dinner in every language in Europe

My notion then is this I have a great deal of spare time on my hands
and as I am told you pay a handsome sum to persons writing for you I
will furnish you occasionally with some of my views upon men and things
occasional histories of my acquaintance which I think may amuse you
personal narratives of my own essays and what not I am told that I do
not spell correctly This of course I dont know but you will remember
that Richelieu and Marlborough could not spell and egad I am an honest
man and desire to be no better than they I know that it is the matter
and not the manner which is of importance Have the goodness then to
let one of your understrappers correct the spelling and the grammar
of my papers and you can give him a few shillings in my name for his
trouble

Begging you to accept the assurance of my high consideration I am sir

Your obedient servant

GEORGE SAVAGE FITZBOODLE

PSBy the way I have said in my letter that I found ALL literary
persons vulgar and dull Permit me to contradict this with regard to
yourself I met you once at Blackwall I think it was and really did
not remark anything offensive in your accent or appearance


Before commencing the series of moral disquisitions c which I intend
the reader may as well know who I am and what my past course of life
has been To say that I am a FitzBoodle is to say at once that I am a
gentleman Our family has held the estate of Boodle ever since the
reign of Henry II and it is out of no ill will to my elder brother
or unnatural desire for his death but only because the estate is a
very good one that I wish heartily it was mine I would say as much of
Chatsworth or Eaton Hall

I am not in the first place what is called a ladies man having
contracted an irrepressible habit of smoking after dinner which has
obliged me to give up a great deal of the dear creatures society nor
can I go much to countryhouses for the same reason Say what they will
ladies do not like you to smoke in their bedrooms their silly little
noses scent out the odor upon the chintz weeks after you have left
them Sir John has been caught coming to bed particularly merry and
redolent of cigarsmoke young George from Eton was absolutely found
in the little greenhouse puffing an Havana and when discovered they
both lay the blame upon FitzBoodle It was Mr FitzBoodle mamma
says George who offered me the cigar and I did not like to refuse
him That rascal Fitz seduced us my dear says Sir John and kept
us laughing until past midnight Her ladyship instantly sets me down as
a person to be avoided George whispers she to her boy promise me
on your honor when you go to town not to know that man And when she
enters the breakfastroom for prayers the first greeting is a peculiar
expression of countenance and inhaling of breath by which my lady
indicates the presence of some exceedingly disagreeable odor in the
room She makes you the faintest of curtsies and regards you if not
with a flashing eye as in the novels at least with a distended
nostril During the whole of the service her heart is filled with the
blackest gall towards you and she is thinking about the best means of
getting you out of the house

What is this smoking that it should be considered a crime I believe in
my heart that women are jealous of it as of a rival They speak of it
as of some secret awful vice that seizes upon a man and makes him a
pariah from genteel society I would lay a guinea that many a lady who
has just been kind enough to rend the above lines lays down the book
after this confession of mine that I am a smoker and says Oh the
vulgar wretch and passes on to something else

The fact is that the cigar IS a rival to the ladies and their
conqueror too In the chief pipesmoking nations they are kept in
subjection While the chief Little White Belt smokes the women are
silent in his wigwam while Mahomet Ben Jawbrahim causes volumes of
odorous incense of Latakia to play round his beard the women of the
harem do not disturb his meditations but only add to the delight of
them by tinkling on a dulcimer and dancing before him When Professor
Strumpff of Gottingen takes down No 13 from the wall with a picture
of Beatrice Cenci upon it and which holds a pound of canaster the Frau
Professorin knows that for two hours Hermann is engaged and takes up
her stockings and knits in quiet The constitution of French society
has been quite changed within the last twelve years an ancient and
respectable dynasty has been overthrown an aristocracy which Napoleon
could never master has disappeared and from what cause I do not
hesitate to sayFROM THE HABIT OF SMOKING Ask any man whether five
years before the revolution of July if you wanted a cigar at Paris
they did not bring you a roll of tobacco with a straw in it Now the
whole city smokes society is changed and be sure of this ladies
a similar combat is going on in this country at present between
cigarsmoking and you Do you suppose you will conquer Look over the
wide world and see that your adversary has overcome it Germany has
been puffing for threescore years France smokes to a man Do you think
you can keep the enemy out of England Psha look at his progress Ask
the clubhouses Have they smokingrooms or not Are they not obliged to
yield to the general want of the age in spite of the resistance of the
old women on the committees I for my part do not despair to see a
bishop lolling out of the Athenaeum with a cheroot in his mouth or
at any rate a pipe stuck in his shovelhat

But as in all great causes and in promulgating new and illustrious
theories their first propounders and exponents are generally the
victims of their enthusiasm of course the first preachers of smoking
have been martyrs too and George FitzBoodle is one The first gasman
was ruined the inventor of steamengine printing became a pauper I
began to smoke in days when the task was one of some danger and paid
the penalty of my crime I was flogged most fiercely for my first cigar
for being asked to dine one Sunday evening with a halfpay colonel of
dragoons the gallant simple humorous Shortcutheaven bless himI
have had many a guinea from him who had so few he insisted upon my
smoking in his room at the Salopian and the consequence was that I
became so violently ill as to be reported intoxicated upon my return
to SlaughterHouse School where I was a boarder and I was whipped the
next morning for my peccadillo At Christ Church one of our tutors was
the celebrated lamented Otto Rose who would have been a bishop under
the present Government had not an immoderate indulgence in watergruel
cut short his elegant and useful career He was a good man a pretty
scholar and poet the episode upon the discovery of eaudeCologne
in his prizepoem on The Rhine was considered a masterpiece of art
though I am not much of a judge myself upon such matters and he was as
remarkable for his fondness for a tuft as for his nervous antipathy to
tobacco As illluck would have it my rooms in Tom Quad were exactly
under his and I was grown by this time to be a confirmed smoker I was
a baronets son we are of James the Firsts creation and I do believe
our tutor could have pardoned any crime in the world but this He had
seen me in a tandem and at that moment was seized with a violent fit
of sneezingsternutatory paroxysm he called itat the conclusion of
which I was a mile down the Woodstock Road He had seen me in pink as
we used to call it swaggering in the open sunshine across a grassplat
in the court but spied out opportunely a servitor one Todhunter by
name who was going to morning chapel with his shoestring untied
and forthwith sprung towards that unfortunate person to set him an
imposition Everything in fact but tobacco he could forgive Why
did cursed fortune bring him into the rooms over mine The odor of the
cigars made his gentle spirit quite furious and one luckless morning
when I was standing before my oak and chanced to puff a great bouffee
of Varinas into his face he forgot his respect for my family altogether
I was the second son and my brother a sickly creature THENhe is now
sixteen stone in weight and has a halfscore of children gave me a
severe lecture to which I replied rather hotly as was my wont And
then came demand for an apology refusal on my part appeal to the dean
convocation and rustication of George Savage FitzBoodle

My father had taken a second wife of the noble house of Flintskinner
and Lady FitzBoodle detested smoking as a woman of her high principles
should She had an entire mastery over the worthy old gentleman and
thought I was a sort of demon of wickedness The old man went to his
grave with some similar notionheaven help him and left me but
the wretched twelve thousand pounds secured to me on my poor mothers
property

In the army my luck was much the same I joined the th Lancers
LieutCol Lord Martingale in the year 1817 I only did duty with the
regiment for three months We were quartered at Cork where I found the
Irish doodheen and tobacco the pleasantest smoking possible and was
found by his lordship one day upon stable duty smoking the shortest
dearest little dumpy claypipe in the world

Cornet FitzBoodle said my lord in a towering passion from what
blackguard did you get that pipe

I omit the oaths which garnished invariably his lordships conversation

I got it my lord said I from one Terence Mullins a jingledriver
with a packet of his peculiar tobacco You sometimes smoke Turkish I
believe do try this Isnt it good And in the simplest way in the
world I puffed a volume into his face I see you like it said I so
coolly that the menand I do believe the horsesburst out laughing

He started backchoking almost and recovered himself only to vent such
a storm of oaths and curses that I was compelled to request Capt
Rawdon the captain on duty to take note of his lordships words and
unluckily could not help adding a question which settled my business
You were good enough I said to ask me my lord from what
blackguard I got my pipe might I ask from what blackguard you learned
your language

This was quite enough Had I said from what GENTLEMAN did your
lordship learn your language the point would have been quite as good
and my Lord Martingale would have suffered in my place as it was I
was so strongly recommended to sell out by his Royal Highness the
CommanderinChief that being of a goodnatured disposition never
knowing how to refuse a friend I at once threw up my hopes of military
distinction and retired into civil life

My lord was kind enough to meet me afterwards in a field in the Glanmire
Road where he put a ball into my leg This I returned to him some years
later with about twentythree othersblack oneswhen he came to be
balloted for at a club of which I have the honor to be a member

Thus by the indulgence of a simple and harmless propensityof a
propensity which can inflict an injury upon no person or thing except
the coat and the person of him who indulges in itof a custom honored
and observed in almost all the nations of the worldof a custom which
far from leading a man into any wickedness or dissipation to which
youth is subject on the contrary begets only benevolent silence and
thoughtful goodhumored observationI found at the age of twenty all
my prospects in life destroyed I cared not for woman in those days
the calm smoker has a sweet companion in his pipe I did not drink
immoderately of wine for though a friend to trifling potations to
excessively strong drinks tobacco is abhorrent I never thought of
gambling for the lover of the pipe has no need of such excitement but
I was considered a monster of dissipation in my family and bade fair to
come to ruin

Look at George my motherinlaw said to the genteel and correct young
Flintskinners He entered the world with every prospect in life and
see in what an abyss of degradation his fatal habits have plunged him
At school he was flogged and disgraced he was disgraced and rusticated
at the university he was disgraced and expelled from the army He
might have had the living of Boodle her ladyship gave it to one of
her nephews but he would not take his degree his papa would have
purchased him a troopnay a lieutenantcolonelcy some day but for his
fatal excesses And now as long as my dear husband will listen to the
voice of a wife who adores himnever never shall he spend a shilling
upon so worthless a young man He has a small income from his mother
I cannot but think that the first Lady FitzBoodle was a weak and
misguided person let him live upon his mean pittance as he can and I
heartily pray we may not hear of him in gaol

My brother after he came to the estate married the ninth daughter
of our neighbor Sir John Spreadeagle and Boodle Hall has seen a new
little FitzBoodle with every succeeding spring The dowager retired to
Scotland with a large jointure and a wondrous heap of savings Lady Fitz
is a good creature but she thinks me something diabolical trembles
when she sees me and gathers all her children about her rushes into
the nursery whenever I pay that little seminary a visit and actually
slapped poor little Franks ears one day when I was teaching him to ride
upon the back of a Newfoundland dog

George said my brother to me the last time I paid him a visit at the
old hall dont be angry my dear fellow but Maria is in ahumin
a delicate situation expecting herhumthe eleventhand do
you know you frighten her It was but yesterday you met her in the
rookeryyou were smoking that enormous German pipeand when she came
in she had an hysterical seizure and Drench says that in her situation
its dangerous And I say George if you go to town youll find a
couple of hundred at your bankers And with this the poor fellow shook
me by the hand and called for a fresh bottle of claret

Afterwards he told me with many hesitations that my room at Boodle
Hall had been made into a second nursery I see my sisterinlaw in
London twice or thrice in the season and the little people who have
almost forgotten to call me uncle George

Its hard too for I am a lonely man after all and my heart yearns to
them The other day I smuggled a couple of them into my chambers and
had a little feast of cream and strawberries to welcome them But it had
like to have cost the nurserymaid a Swiss girl that FitzBoodle hired
somewhere in his travels her place My stepmamma who happened to be
in town came flying down in her chariot pounced upon the poor thing
and the children in the midst of the entertainment and when I asked
her with rather a bad grace to be sure to take a chair and a share of
the feastMr FitzBoodle said she I am not accustomed to sit
down in a place that smells of tobacco like an alehousean alehouse
inhabited by a SERPENT sir A SERPENTdo you understand mewho
carries his poison into his brothers own house and purshues his
eenfamous designs before his brothers own children Put on Miss Marias
bonnet this instant Mamsell ontondyvoo Metty le bonny a mamsell And
I shall take care Mamsell that you return to Switzerland tomorrow
Ive no doubt you are a relation of Courvoisieroui oui courvoisier
vous comprennyand you shall certainly be sent back to your friends

With this speech and with the children and their maid sobbing before
her my lady retired but for once my sisterinlaw was on my side not
liking the meddlement of the elder lady

I know then that from indulging in that simple habit of smoking I
have gained among the ladies a dreadful reputation I see that they look
coolly upon me and darkly at their husbands when they arrive at home in
my company Men I observe in consequence ask me to dine much oftener
at the club or the Star and Garter at Richmond or at Lovegroves
than in their own houses and with this sort of arrangement I am fain to
acquiesce for as I said before I am of an easy temper and can at any
rate take my cigarcase out after dinner at Blackwall when my lady or
the duchess is not by I know of course the best MEN in town and
as for ladies society not having it for I will have none of your
pseudoladies such as sometimes honor bachelors partiesactresses
couturieres operadancers and so forthas for ladies society I
say I cry pish tis not worth the trouble of the complimenting and
the bother of pumps and black silk stockings

Let any man remember what ladies society was when he had an opportunity
of seeing them among themselves as Whatdyecallim does in the
ThesmophoriaI beg pardon I was on the verge of a classical allusion
which I abominateI mean at that period of his life when the intellect
is pretty acute though the body is smallnamely when a young
gentleman is about eleven years of age dining at his fathers
table during the holidays and is requested by his papa to quit the
dinnertable when the ladies retire from it

Corbleu I recollect their whole talk as well as if it had been
whispered but yesterday and can see after a long dinner the yellow
summer sun throwing long shadows over the lawn before the diningroom
windows and my poor mother and her company of ladies sailing away to
the musicroom in old Boodle Hall The Countess Dawdley was the great
lady in our county a portly lady who used to love crimson satin in
those days and birdsofparadise She was flaxenhaired and the Regent
once said she resembled one of King Charless beauties

When Sir John Todcaster used to begin his famous story of the exciseman
I shall not tell it here for very good reasons my poor mother
used to turn to Lady Dawdley and give that mystic signal at which all
females rise from their chairs Tufthunt the curate would spring
from his seat and be sure to be the first to open the door for the
retreating ladies and my brother Tom and I though remaining stoutly in
our places were speedily ejected from them by the governors invariable
remark Tom and George if you have had QUITE enough of wine you had
better go and join your mamma Yonder she marches heaven bless her
through the old oak hall how long the shadows of the antlers are on the
wainscot and the armor of Rollo FitzBoodle looks in the sunset as if
it were emblazoned with rubiesyonder she marches stately and tall
in her invariable pearlcolored tabbinet followed by Lady Dawdley
blazing like a flamingo next comes Lady Emily Tufthunt she was Lady
Emily Flintskinner who will not for all the world take precedence of
rich vulgar kind goodhumored Mrs COLONEL Grogwater as she would be
called with a yellow little husband from Madras who first taught me
to drink sangaree He was a new arrival in our county but paid nobly to
the hounds and occupied hospitably a house which was always famous
for its hospitalitySievely Hall poor Bob Cullender ran through seven
thousand a year before he was thirty years old Once when I was a
lad Colonel Grogwater gave me two gold mohurs out of his desk for
whistmarkers and Im sorry to say I ran up from Eton and sold them
both for seventythree shillings at a shop in Cornhill But to return
to the ladies who are all this while kept waiting in the hall and to
their usual conversation after dinner

Can any man forget how miserably flat it was Five matrons sit on sofas
and talk in a subdued voiceFirst Lady mysteriouslyMy dear Lady
Dawdley do tell me about poor Susan Tuckett

Second LadyAll three children are perfectly well and I assure you
as fine babies as I ever saw in my life I made her give them Daffys
Elixir the first day and it was the greatest mercy that I had some of
Fredericks babyclothes by me for you know I had provided Susan with
sets for one only and really

Third LadyOf course one couldnt and for my part I think your
ladyship is a great deal too kind to these people A little gardeners
boy dressed in Lord Dawdleys frocks indeed I recollect that one at his
christening had the sweetest lace in the world

Fourth LadyWhat do you think of this maamLady Emily I mean I
have just had it from Howell and Jamesguipure they call it Isnt
it an odd name for lace And they charge me upon my conscience four
guineas a yard

Third LadyMy mother when she came to Flintskinner had lace upon
her robe that cost sixty guineas a yard maam Twas sent from Malines
direct by our relation the Count dAraignay

Fourth Lady asideI thought she would not let the evening pass
without talking of her Malines lace and her Count dAraignay Odious
people they dont spare their backs but they pinch their

Here Tom upsets a coffeecup over his white jean trousers and another
young gentleman bursts into a laugh saying By Jove thats a good
un

George my dear says mamma had not you and your young friend better
go into the garden But mind no fruit or Dr Glauber must be called in
again immediately And we all go and in ten minutes I and my brother
are fighting in the stables

If instead of listening to the matrons and their discourse we had
taken the opportunity of attending to the conversation of the Misses we
should have heard matter not a whit more interesting

First MissThey were all three in blue crape you never saw anything
so odious And I know for a certainty that they wore those dresses at
Muddlebury at the archeryball and I dare say they had them in town

Second MissDont you think Jemima decidedly crooked And those
fair complexions they freckle so that really Miss Blanche ought to be
called Miss Brown

Third MissHe he he

Fourth MissDont you think Blanche is a pretty name

First MissLa do you think so dear Why its my second name

Second MissThen Im sure Captain Travers thinks it a BEAUTIFUL
name

Third MissHe he he

Fourth MissWhat was he telling you at dinner that seemed to interest
you so

First MissO law nothingthat is yes Charlesthat isCaptain
Travers is a sweet poet and was reciting to me some lines that he had
composed upon a faded violet

 The odor from the flower is gone
 That like thy

like thy something I forget what it was but his lines are sweet and
so original too I wish that horrid Sir John Todcaster had not begun his
story of the exciseman for Lady FitzBoodle always quits the table when
he begins

Third MissDo you like those tufts that gentlemen wear sometimes on
their chins

Second MissNonsense Mary

Third MissWell I only asked Jane Frank thinks you know that
he shall very soon have one and puts bearsgrease on his chin every
night

Second MissMary nonsense

Third MissWell only ask him You know he came to our dressingroom
last night and took the pomatum away and he says that when boys go to
Oxford they always

First MissO heavens have you heard the news about the Lancers
Charlesthat is Captain Travers told it me

Second MissLaw they wont go away before the ball I hope

First MissNo but on the 15th they are to shave their moustaches He
says that Lord Tufto is in a perfect fury about it

Second MissAnd poor George Beardmore too c

Here Tom upsets the coffee over his trousers and the conversations end
I can recollect a dozen such and ask any man of sense whether such talk
amuses him

Try again to speak to a young lady while you are dancingwhat we call
in this countrya quadrille What nonsense do you invariably give and
receive in return No I am a womanscorner and dont care to own it I
hate young ladies Have I not been in love with several and has any one
of them ever treated me decently I hate married women Do they not hate
me and simply because I smoke try to draw their husbands away from
my society I hate dowagers Have I not cause Does not every dowager in
London point to George FitzBoodle as to a dissolute wretch whom young
and old should avoid

And yet do not imagine that I have not loved I have and madly many
many times I am but eightandthirty not past the age of passion and
may very likely end by running off with an heiressor a cookmaid
for who knows what strange freaks Love may choose to play in his own
particular person and I hold a man to be a mean creature who calculates
about checking any such sacred impulse as lawful loveI say though
despising the sex in general for their conduct to me I know of
particular persons belonging to it who are worthy of all respect and
esteem and as such I beg leave to point out the particular young lady
who is perusing these lines Do not dear madam then imagine that if
I knew you I should be disposed to sneer at you Ah no FitzBoodles
bosom has tenderer sentiments than from his way of life you would fancy
and stern by rule is only too soft by practice Shall I whisper to you
the story of one or two of my attachments All terminating fatally
not in death but in disappointment which as it occurred I used
to imagine a thousand times more bitter than death but from which one
recovers somehow more readily than from the othernamed complaintall
I say terminating wretchedly to myself as if some fatality pursued my
desire to become a domestic character

  He is fiveandforty if he is a day oldO Y

My first loveno let us pass THAT over Sweet one thy name shall
profane no hireling page Sweet sweet memory Ah ladies those
delicate hearts of yours have too felt the throb And between the
last ob in the word throb and the words now written I have passed a
delicious period of perhaps an hour perhaps a minute I know not how
long thinking of that holy first love and of her who inspired it How
clearly every single incident of the passion is remembered by me
and yet twas long long since I was but a child thena child at
schooland if the truth must be told Lra Rggls I would not write
her whole name to be made one of the Marquess of Hertfords executors
was a woman full thirteen years older than myself at the period of
which I write she must have been at least fiveandtwenty She and her
mother used to sell tarts hardbake lollipops and other such simple
comestibles on Wednesdays and Saturdays halfholidays at a private
school where I received the first rudiments of a classical education
I used to go and sit before her tray for hours but I do not think the
poor girl ever supposed any motive led me so constantly to her little
stall beyond a vulgar longing for her tarts and her gingerbeer Yes
even at that early period my actions were misrepresented and the
fatality which has oppressed my whole life began to show itselfthe
purest passion was misinterpreted by her and my schoolfellows and
they thought I was actuated by simple gluttony They nicknamed me
Alicompayne

Well be it so Laugh at early passion ye who will a highborn boy madly
in love with a lowly gingerbeer girl She married afterwards took the
name of Latter and now keeps with her old husband a turnpike through
which I often ride but I can recollect her bright and rosy of a sunny
summer afternoon her red cheeks shaded by a battered straw bonnet her
tarts and gingerbeer upon a neat white cloth before her mending blue
worsted stockings until the young gentlemen should interrupt her by
coming to buy

Many persons will call this description low I do not envy them their
gentility and have always observed through life as to be sure every
other GENTLEMAN has observed as well as myself that it is your parvenu
who stickles most for what he calls the genteel and has the most
squeamish abhorrence for what is frank and natural Let us pass at once
however as all the world must be pleased to a recital of an affair
which occurred in the very best circles of society as they are called
viz my next unfortunate attachment

It did not occur for several years after that simple and platonic
passion just described for though they may talk of youth as the season
of romance it has always appeared to me that there are no beings in
the world so entirely unromantic and selfish as certain young English
gentlemen from the age of fifteen to twenty The oldest Lovelace about
town is scarcely more hardhearted and scornful than they they ape all
sorts of selfishness and rouerie they aim at excelling at cricket at
billiards at rowing and drinking and set more store by a red coat
and a neat pair of topboots than by any other glory A young fellow
staggers into college chapel of a morning and communicates to all his
friends that he was so CUT last night with the greatest possible
pride He makes a joke of having sisters and a kind mother at home who
loves him and if he speaks of his father it is with a knowing sneer to
say that he has a tailors and a horsedealers bill that will surprise
the old governor He would be ashamed of being in love I in common
with my kind had these affectations and my perpetual custom of smoking
added not a little to my reputation as an accomplished roue What came
of this custom in the army and at college the reader has already heard
Alas in life it went no better with me and many pretty chances I had
went off in that accursed smoke

After quitting the army in the abrupt manner stated I passed some
short time at home and was tolerated by my motherinlaw because I
had formed an attachment to a young lady of good connections and with a
considerable fortune which was really very nearly becoming mine Mary
MAlister was the only daughter of Colonel MAlister late of the Blues
and Lady Susan his wife Her ladyship was no more and indeed of no
family compared to ours which has refused a peerage any time these two
hundred years but being an earls daughter and a Scotchwoman Lady
Emily FitzBoodle did not fail to consider her highly Lady Susan was
daughter of the late Admiral Earl of Marlingspike and Baron Plumduff
The Colonel Miss MAlisters father had a good estate of which his
daughter was the heiress and as I fished her out of the water upon
a pleasureparty and swam with her to shore we became naturally
intimate and Colonel MAlister forgot on account of the service
rendered to him the dreadful reputation for profligacy which I enjoyed
in the county

Well to cut a long story short which is told here merely for the
moral at the end of it I should have been FitzBoodle MAlister at this
minute most probably and master of four thousand a year but for
the fatal cigarbox I bear Mary no malice in saying that she was a
highspirited little girl loving before all things her own way nay
perhaps I do not from long habit and indulgence in tobaccosmoking
appreciate the delicacy of female organizations which were oftentimes
most painfully affected by it She was a keensighted little person
and soon found that the world had belied poor George FitzBoodle who
instead of being the cunning monster people supposed him to be was a
simple reckless goodhumored honest fellow marvellously addicted to
smoking idleness and telling the truth She called me Orson and I
was happy enough on the 14th February in the year 18 its of no
consequence to send her such a pretty little copy of verses about
Orson and Valentine in which the rude habits of the savage man were
shown to be overcome by the polished graces of his kind and brilliant
conqueror that she was fairly overcome and said to me George
FitzBoodle if you give up smoking for a year I will marry you

I swore I would of course and went home and flung four pounds of
Hudsons cigars two meerschaum pipes that had cost me ten guineas
at the establishment of Mr Gattie at Oxford a tobaccobag that Lady
FitzBoodle had given me BEFORE her marriage with my father it was the
only present that I ever had from her or any member of the Flintskinner
family and some choice packets of Varinas and Syrian into the lake
in Boodle Park The weapon amongst them all which I most regretted
waswill it be believedthe little black doodheen which had been the
cause of the quarrel between Lord Martingale and me However it went
along with the others I would not allow my groom to have so much as a
cigar lest I should be tempted hereafter and the consequence was that
a few days after many fat carps and tenches in the lake I must confess
twas no bigger than a pond nibbled at the tobacco and came floating
on their backs on the top of the water quite intoxicated My conversion
made some noise in the county being emphasized as it were by this fact
of the fish I cant tell you with what pangs I kept my resolution but
keep it I did for some time

With so much beauty and wealth Mary MAlister had of course many
suitors and among them was the young Lord Dawdley whose mamma has
previously been described in her gown of red satin As I used to thrash
Dawdley at school I thrashed him in afterlife in love he put up with
his disappointment pretty well and came after a while and shook hands
with me telling me of the bets that there were in the county where the
whole story was known for and against me For the fact is as I must
own that Mary MAlister the queerest frankest of women made no
secret of the agreement or the cause of it

I did not care a penny for Orson she said but he would go on
writing me such dear pretty verses that at last I couldnt help saying
yes But if he breaks his promise to me I declare upon my honor Ill
break mine and nobodys heart will be broken either

This was the perfect fact as I must confess and I declare that it was
only because she amused me and delighted me and provoked me and made
me laugh very much and because no doubt she was very rich that I had
any attachment for her

For heavens sake George my father said to me as I quitted home to
follow my beloved to London remember that you are a younger brother
and have a lovely girl and four thousand a year within a years reach of
you Smoke as much as you like my boy after marriage added the old
gentleman knowingly as if HE honest soul after his second marriage
dared drink an extra pint of wine without my ladys permission but
eschew the tobaccoshops till then

I went to London resolving to act upon the paternal advice and oh how
I longed for the day when I should be married vowing in my secret soul
that I would light a cigar as I walked out of St Georges Hanover
Square

Well I came to London and so carefully avoided smoking that I would
not even go into Hudsons shop to pay his bill and as smoking was not
the fashion then among young men as thank heaven it is now I had
not many temptations from my friends examples in my clubs or elsewhere
only little Dawdley began to smoke as if to spite me He had never done
so before but confessedthe rascalthat he enjoyed a cigar now
if it were but to mortify me But I took to other and more dangerous
excitements and upon the nights when not in attendance upon Mary
MAlister might be found in very dangerous proximity to a polished
mahogany table round which claretbottles circulated a great deal
too often or worse still to a table covered with green cloth and
ornamented with a couple of waxcandles and a couple of packs of cards
and four gentlemen playing the enticing game of whist Likewise I
came to carry a snuffbox and to consume in secret huge quantities of
rappee

For ladies society I was even then disinclined hating and despising
smalltalk and dancing and hot routs and vulgar scrambles for
suppers I never could understand the pleasure of acting the part of
lackey to a dowager and standing behind her chair or bustling through
the crowd for her carriage I always found an opera too long by
two acts and have repeatedly fallen asleep in the presence of Mary
MAlister herself sitting at the back of the box shaded by the huge
beret of her old aunt Lady Betty Plumduff and many a time has Dawdley
with Miss MAlister on his arm wakened me up at the close of the
entertainment in time to offer my hand to Lady Betty and lead the
ladies to their carriage If I attended her occasionally to any ball
or party of pleasure I went it must be confessed with clumsy
illdisguised illhumor Good heavens have I often and often thought in
the midst of a song or the very thick of a ballroom can people prefer
this to a book and a sofa and a dear dear cigarbox from thy stores
O charming Mariana Woodville Deprived of my favorite plant I grew sick
in mind and body moody sarcastic and discontented

Such a state of things could not long continue nor could Miss MAlister
continue to have much attachment for such a sullen illconditioned
creature as I then was She used to make me wild with her wit and her
sarcasm nor have I ever possessed the readiness to parry or reply
to those fine points of womans wit and she treated me the more
mercilessly as she saw that I could not resist her

Well the polite reader must remember a great fete that was given at
B House some years back in honor of his Highness the Hereditary
Prince of KalbsbratenPumpernickel who was then in London on a visit to
his illustrious relatives It was a fancy ball and the poems of Scott
being at that time all the fashion Mary was to appear in the character
of the Lady of the Lake old MAlister making a very tall and
severelooking harper Dawdley a most insignificant Fitzjames and your
humble servant a stalwart manly Roderick Dhu We were to meet at B
House at twelve oclock and as I had no fancy to drive through the town
in my cab dressed in a kilt and philibeg I agreed to take a seat in
Dawdleys carriage and to dress at his house in May Fair At eleven
I left a very pleasant bachelors party growling to quit them and the
honest jovial claretbottle in order to scrape and cut capers like a
harlequin from the theatre When I arrived at Dawdleys I mounted to a
dressingroom and began to array myself in my cursed costume

The art of costuming was by no means so well understood in those days
as it has been since and mine was out of all correctness I was made
to sport an enormous plume of black ostrichfeathers such as never was
worn by any Highland chief and had a huge tigerskin sporran to dangle
like an apron before innumerable yards of plaid petticoat The tartan
cloak was outrageously hot and voluminous it was the dogdays and
all these things I was condemned to wear in the midst of a crowd of a
thousand people

Dawdley sent up word as I was dressing that his dress had not arrived
and he took my cab and drove off in a rage to his tailor

There was no hurry I thought to make a fool of myself so having put
on a pair of plaid trews and very neat pumps with shoebuckles my
courage failed me as to the rest of the dress and taking down one of
his dressinggowns I went down stairs to the study to wait until he
should arrive

The windows of the pretty room were open and a snug sofa with
innumerable cushions drawn towards one of them A great tranquil moon
was staring into the chamber in which stood amidst books and all
sorts of bachelors lumber a silver tray with a couple of tall Venice
glasses and a bottle of Maraschino bound with straw I can see now the
twinkle of the liquor in the moonshine as I poured it into the glass
and I swallowed two or three little cups of it for my spirits were
downcast Close to the tray of Maraschino stoodmust I say ita box
a mere box of cedar bound rudely together with pink paper branded with
the name of Hudson on the side and bearing on the cover the arms of
Spain I thought I would just take up the box and look in it

Ah heaven there they werea hundred and fifty of them in calm
comfortable rows lovingly side by side they lay with the great moon
shining down upon themthin at the tip full in the waist
elegantly round and full a little spot here and there shining upon
thembeautyspots upon the cheek of Sylvia The house was quite quiet
Dawdley always smoked in his roomI had not smoked for four months and
eleven days



When Lord Dawdley came into the study he did not make any remarks and
oh how easy my heart felt He was dressed in his green and boots after
Westalls picture correctly

Its time to be off George said he they told me you were dressed
long ago Come up my man and get ready

I rushed up into the dressingroom and madly dashed my head and arms
into a pool of eaudeCologne I drank I believe a tumberful of it I
called for my clothes and strange to say they were gone My servant
brought them however saying that he had put them awaymaking some
stupid excuse I put them on not heeding them much for I was half
tipsy with the excitement of the ci of the smo of what had taken
place in Dawdleys study and with the Maraschino and the eaudeCologue
I had drunk

What a fine odor of lavenderwater said Dawdley as we rode in the
carriage

I put my head out of the window and shrieked out a laugh but made no
other reply

Whats the joke George said Dawdley Did I say anything witty

No cried I yelling still more wildly nothing more witty than
usual

Dont be severe George said he with a mortified air and we drove
on to B House



There must have been something strange and wild in my appearance and
those awful black plumes as I passed through the crowd for I observed
people looking and making a strange nasal noise it is called sniffing
and I have no other more delicate term for it and making way as
I pushed on But I moved forward very fiercely for the wine the
Maraschino the eaudeCologne and thethe excitement had rendered me
almost wild and at length I arrived at the place where my lovely Lady
of the Lake and her Harper stood How beautiful she lookedall eyes
were upon her as she stood blushing When she saw me however her
countenance assumed an appearance of alarm Good heavens George she
said stretching her hand to me what makes you look so wild and pale
I advanced and was going to take her hand when she dropped it with a
scream

Ahahah she said Mr FitzBoodle youve been smoking

There was an immense laugh from four hundred people round about us and
the scoundrelly Dawdley joined in the yell I rushed furiously out
and as I passed hurtled over the fat Hereditary Prince of
KalbsbratenPumpernickel

Es riecht hier ungeheuer stark von Tabak I heard his Highness say as
I madly flung myself through the aidesdecamp

The next day Mary MAlister in a note full of the most odious good
sense and sarcasm reminded me of our agreement said that she was quite
convinced that we were not by any means fitted for one another and
begged me to consider myself henceforth quite free The little wretch
had the impertinence to send me a dozen boxes of cigars which she
said would console me for my lost love as she was perfectly certain
that I was not mercenary and that I loved tobacco better than any woman
in the world

I believe she was right though I have never to this day been able to
pardon the scoundrelly stratagem by which Dawdley robbed me of a wife
and won one himself As I was lying on his sofa looking at the moon and
lost in a thousand happy contemplations Lord Dawdley returning
from the tailors saw me smoking at my leisure On entering his
dressingroom a horrible treacherous thought struck him I must not
betray my friend said he but in love all is fair and he shall
betray himself There were my tartans my cursed feathers my
tigerskin sporran upon the sofa

He called up my groom he made the rascal put on all my clothes and
giving him a guinea and four cigars bade him lock himself into the
little pantry and smoke them WITHOUT TAKING THE CLOTHES OFF John did
so and was very ill in consequence and so when I came to B House
my clothes were redolent of tobacco and I lost lovely Mary MAlister

I am godfather to one of Lady Dawdleys boys and hers is the only house
where I am allowed to smoke unmolested but I have never been able to
admire Dawdley a sly sournois spiritless lilylivered fellow that
took his name off all his clubs the year he married




DOROTHEA


Beyond sparring and cricket I do not recollect I learned anything
useful at SlaughterHouse School where I was educated according to an
old family tradition which sends particular generations of gentlemen to
particular schools in the kingdom and such is the force of habit that
though I hate the place I shall send my own son thither too should
I marry any day I say I learned little that was useful at Slaughter
House and nothing that was ornamental I would as soon have thought
of learning to dance as of learning to climb chimneys Up to the age of
seventeen as I have shown I had a great contempt for the female race
and when age brought with it warmer and juster sentiments where was
II could no more dance nor prattle to a young girl than a young bear
could I have seen the ugliest little lowbred wretches carrying off
young and lovely creatures twirling with them in waltzes whispering
between their glossy curls in quadrilles simpering with perfect
equanimity and cutting pas in that abominable cavalier seul until my
soul grew sick with fury In a word I determined to learn to dance

But such things are hard to be acquired late in life when the bones and
the habits of a man are formed Look at a man in a huntingfield who has
not been taught to ride as a boy All the pluck and courage in the world
will not make the man of him that I am or as any man who has had the
advantages of early education in the field

In the same way with dancing Though I went to work with immense energy
both in Brewer Street Golden Square with an advertising fellow and
afterwards with old Coulon at Paris I never was able to be EASY in
dancing and though little Coulon instructed me in a smile it was a
cursed forced one that looked like the grin of a person in extreme
agony I once caught sight of it in a glass and have hardly ever smiled
since

Most young men about London have gone through that strange secret ordeal
of the dancingschool I am given to understand that young snobs from
attorneys offices banks shops and the like make not the least
mystery of their proceedings in the saltatory line but trip gayly with
pumps in hand to some dancingplace about Soho waltz and quadrille it
with Miss Greengrocer or Miss Butcher and fancy they have had rather
a pleasant evening There is one house in Dover Street where behind
a dirty curtain such figures may be seen hopping every night to a
perpetual fiddling and I have stood sometimes wondering in the street
with about six blackguard boys wondering too at the strange contortions
of the figures jumping up and down to the mysterious squeaking of the
kit Have they no shame ces gens are such degrading initiations to be
held in public No the snob may but the man of refined mind never can
submit to show himself in public laboring at the apprenticeship of this
most absurd art It is owing perhaps to this modesty and the fact
that I had no sisters at home that I have never thoroughly been able to
dance for though I always arrive at the end of a quadrille and
thank heaven for it too and though I believe I make no mistake in
particular yet I solemnly confess I have never been able thoroughly
to comprehend the mysteries of it or what I have been about from the
beginning to the end of the dance I always look at the lady opposite
and do as she does if SHE did not know how to dance par hasard it
would be all up But if they cant do anything else women can dance
let us give them that praise at least

In London then for a considerable time I used to get up at eight
oclock in the morning and pass an hour alone with Mr Wilkinson of
the Theatres Royal in Golden Squarean hour alone It was one two
three one two threenow jumpright foot more out Mr Smith and if
you COULD try and look a little more cheerful your partner sir would
like you hall the better Wilkinson called me Smith for the fact is
I did not tell him my real name nor thank heaven does he know it to
this day

I never breathed a word of my doings to any soul among my friends once
a pack of them met me in the strange neighborhood when I am ashamed to
say I muttered something about a little French milliner and walked
off looking as knowing as I could

In Paris two Cambridgemen and myself who happened to be staying at
a boardinghouse together agreed to go to Coulon a little creature of
four feet high with a pigtail His room was hung round with glasses He
made us take off our coats and dance each before a mirror Once he was
standing before us playing on his kit the sight of the little master
and the pupil was so supremely ridiculous that I burst into a yell of
laughter which so offended the old man that he walked away abruptly
and begged me not to repeat my visits Nor did I I was just getting
into waltzing then but determined to drop waltzing and content myself
with quadrilling for the rest of my days

This was all very well in France and England but in Germany what was
I to do What did Hercules do when Omphale captivated him What did
Rinaldo do when Armida fixed upon him her twinkling eyes Nay to cut
all historical instances short by going at once to the earliest what
did Adam do when Eve tempted him He yielded and became her slave and
so I do heartily trust every honest man will yield until the end of the
worldhe has no heart who will not When I was in Germany I say I
began to learn to WALTZ The reader from this will no doubt expect
that some new loveadventures befell menor will his gentle heart be
disappointed Two deep and tremendous incidents occurred which shall be
notified on the present occasion

The reader perhaps remembers the brief appearance of his Highness the
Duke of KalbsbratenPumpernickel at B House in the first part of
my Memoirs at that unlucky period of my life when the Duke was led
to remark the odor about my clothes which lost me the hand of Mary
MAlister I somehow found myself in his Highnesss territories of
which anybody may read a description in the Almanach de Gotha His
Highnesss father as is well known married Emilia Kunegunda Thomasina
Charleria Emanuela Louisa Georgina Princess of SaxePumpernickel and a
cousin of his Highness the Duke Thus the two principalities were united
under one happy sovereign in the person of Philibert Sigismund Emanuel
Maria the reigning Duke who has received from his country on
account of the celebrated pump which he erected in the marketplace
of Kalbsbraten the wellmerited appellation of the Magnificent The
allegory which the statues round about the pump represent is of a very
mysterious and complicated sort Minerva is observed leading up Ceres to
a rivergod who has his arms round the neck of Pomona while Mars in
a fullbottomed wig is driven away by Peace under whose mantle two
lovely children representing the Dukes two provinces repose The
celebrated Speck is as need scarcely be said the author of this
piece and of other magnificent edifices in the Residenz such as the
guardroom the skittlehall Grossherzoglich Kalbsbratenpumpernickelisch
Schkittelspielsaal c and the superb sentryboxes before the
GrandDucal Palace He is Knight Grand Cross of the Ancient Kartoffel
Order as indeed is almost every one else in his Highnesss dominions

The town of Kalbsbraten contains a population of two thousand
inhabitants and a palace which would accommodate about six times
that number The principality sends three and a half men to the
German Confederation who are commanded by a General Excellency two
MajorGenerals and sixtyfour officers of lower grades all noble all
knights of the Order and almost all chamberlains to his Highness the
Grand Duke An excellent band of eighty performers is the admiration of
the surrounding country and leads the GrandDucal troops to battle in
time of war Only three of the contingent of soldiers returned from the
Battle of Waterloo where they won much honor the remainder was cut to
pieces on that glorious day

There is a chamber of representatives which however nothing can
induce to sit home and foreign ministers residents from neighboring
courts law presidents town councils c all the adjuncts of a big
or little government The court has its chamberlains and marshals the
Grand Duchess her noble ladies in waiting and blushing maids of honor
Thou wert one Dorothea Dost remember the poor young Englander We
parted in anger but I thinkI think thou hast not forgotten him

The way in which I have Dorothea von Speck present to my mind is this
not as I first saw her in the gardenfor her hair was in bandeaux
then and a large Leghorn hat with a deep ribbon covered half her fair
facenot in a morningdress which by the way was none of the newest
nor the best madebut as I saw her afterwards at a ball at the pleasant
splendid little court where she moved the most beautiful of the
beauties of Kalbsbraten The grand saloon of the palace is lightedthe
Grand Duke and his officers the Duchess and her ladies have passed
through I in my uniform of the th and a number of young
fellows who are evidently admiring my legs and envying my distingue
appearance are waiting round the entrancedoor where a huge Heyduke
is standing and announcing the titles of the guests as they arrive

HERR OBERHOF UND BAUINSPEKTOR VON SPECK shouts the Heyduke and
the little Inspector comes in His lady is on his arm huge in towering
plumes and her favorite costume of light blue Fair women always dress
in light blue or light green and Frau von Speck is very fair and stout

But who comes behind her Lieber Himmel It is Dorothea Did earth
among all the flowers which have sprung from its bosom produce ever one
more beautiful She was none of your heavenly beauties I tell you She
had nothing ethereal about her No sir she was of the earth earthy
and must have weighed ten stone four or five if she weighed an ounce
She had none of your Chinese feet nor waspy unhealthy waists which
those may admire who will No Doras foot was a good stout one you
could see her ankle if her robe was short enough without the aid of
a microscope and that envious little sour skinny Amalia von
Mangelwurzel used to hold up her four fingers and say the two girls
were most intimate friends of course Dear Dorotheas vaist is so much
dicker as dis And so I have no doubt it was

But what then Goethe sings in one of his divine epigrams

Epicures vaunting their taste entitle me vulgar and savage Give them
their Brusselssprouts but I am contented with cabbage


I hate your little womenthat is when I am in love with a tall one
and who would not have loved Dorothea

Fancy her then if you please about five feet four inches highfancy
her in the family color of light blue a little scarf covering the most
brilliant shoulders in the world and a pair of gloves clinging close
round an arm that may perhaps be somewhat too large now but that
Juno might have envied then After the fashion of young ladies on the
continent she wears no jewels or gimcracks her only ornament is a
wreath of vineleaves in her hair with little clusters of artificial
grapes Down on her shoulders falls the brown hair in rich liberal
clusters all that health and goodhumor and beauty can do for her
face kind nature has done for hers Her eyes are frank sparkling and
kind As for her cheeks what paintbox or dictionary contains pigments
or words to describe their red They say she opens her mouth and smiles
always to show the dimples in her cheeks Psha she smiles because she
is happy and kind and goodhumored and not because her teeth are
little pearls

All the young fellows crowd up to ask her to dance and taking from her
waist a little motherofpearl remembrancer she notes them down Old
Schnabel for the polonaise Klingenspohr first waltz Haarbart second
waltz Count Hornpieper the Danish envoy third and so on I have
said why I could not ask her to waltz and I turned away with a pang
and played ecarte with Colonel Trumpenpack all night

In thus introducing this lovely creature in her ballcostume I have
been somewhat premature and had best go back to the beginning of the
history of my acquaintance with her

Dorothea then was the daughter of the celebrated Speck before
mentioned It is one of the oldest names in Germany where her fathers
and mothers houses those of Speck and Eyer are loved wherever they
are known Unlike his warlike progenitor Lorenzo von Speck Dorotheas
father had early shown himself a passionate admirer of art had
quitted home to study architecture in Italy and had become celebrated
throughout Europe and been appointed Oberhofarchitect and Kunst und
Bauinspektor of the united principalities They are but four miles
wide and his genius has consequently but little room to play What art
can do however he does The palace is frequently whitewashed under
his eyes the theatre painted occasionally the noble public buildings
erected of which I have already made mention

I had come to Kalbsbraten scarce knowing whither I went and having in
about ten minutes seen the curiosities of the place I did not care
to see the Kings palace for chairs and tables have no great charm for
me I had ordered horses and wanted to get on I cared not whither
when Fate threw Dorothea in my way I was yawning back to the hotel
through the palacegarden a valetdeplace at my side when I saw a
young lady seated under a tree reading a novel her mamma on the same
bench a fat woman in light blue knitting a stocking and two officers
choked in their stays with various orders on their spinachcolored
coats standing by in first attitudes the one was caressing the
fatladyinblues little dog the other was twirling his own moustache
which was already as nearly as possible curled into his own eye

I dont know how it is but I hate to see men evidently intimate with
nicelooking women and on good terms with themselves Theres something
annoying in their cursed complacencytheir evident sunshiny happiness
Ive no woman to make sunshine for ME and yet my heart tells me that
not one but several such suns would do good to my system

Who are those pertlooking officers says I peevishly to the guide
who are talking to those vulgarlooking women

The big one with the epaulets is Major von Schnabel the little one
with the pale face is Stiefel von Klingenspohr

And the big blue woman

The GrandDucal Pumpernickeliancourtarchitectress and
UpperPalaceandbuildinginspectress Von Speck born V Eyer replied
the guide Your wellborn honor has seen the pump in the marketplace
that is the work of the great Von Speck

And yonder young person

Mr Courtarchitects daughter the Fraulein Dorothea



Dorothea looked up from her novel here and turned her face towards
the stranger who was passing and then blushing turned it down again
Schnabel looked at me with a scowl Klingenspohr with a simper the dog
with a yelp the fat lady in blue just gave one glance and seemed I
thought rather well pleased Silence Lischen said she to the dog
Go on darling Dorothea she added to her daughter who continued her
novel

Her voice was a little tremulous but very low and rich For some reason
or other on getting back to the inn I countermanded the horses and
said I would stay for the night

I not only stayed that night but many many afterwards and as for the
manner in which I became acquainted with the Speck family why it was
a good joke against me at the time and I did not like then to have
it known but now it may as well come out at once Speck as everybody
knows lives in the marketplace opposite his grand work of art the
town pump or fountain I bought a large sheet of paper and having a
knack at drawing sat down with the greatest gravity before the pump
and sketched it for several hours I knew it would bring out old Speck
to see At first he contented himself by flattening his nose against the
windowglasses of his study and looking what the Englander was about
Then he put on his gray cap with the huge green shade and sauntered
to the door then he walked round me and formed one of a band of
streetidlers who were looking on then at last he could restrain
himself no more but pulling off his cap with a low bow began to
discourse upon arts and architecture in particular

It is curious says he that you have taken the same view of which a
print has been engraved

That IS extraordinary says I though it wasnt for I had traced my
drawing at a window off the very print in question I added that I was
like all the world immensely struck with the beauty of the edifice
heard of it at Rome where it was considered to be superior to any of
the celebrated fountains of that capital of the fine arts finally
that unless perhaps the celebrated fountain of Aldgate in London
might compare with it Kalbsbraten building EXCEPT in that case was
incomparable

This speech I addressed in French of which the worthy Hofarchitect
understood somewhat and continuing to reply in German our conversation
grew pretty close It is singular that I can talk to a man and pay him
compliments with the utmost gravity whereas to a woman I at once lose
all selfpossession and have never said a pretty thing in my life

My operations on old Speck were so conducted that in a quarter of an
hour I had elicited from him an invitation to go over the town with
him and see its architectural beauties So we walked through the huge
halffurnished chambers of the palace we panted up the copper pinnacle
of the churchtower we went to see the Museum and Gymnasium and coming
back into the marketplace again what could the Hofarchitect do but
offer me a glass of wine and a seat in his house He introduced me
to his Gattinn his Leocadia the fat woman in blue as a young
worldobserver and worthy artfriend a young scion of British Adel
who had come to refresh himself at the Urquellen of his race and see
his brethren of the great family of Hermann

I saw instantly that the old fellow was of a romantic turn from this
rodomontade to his lady nor was she a whit less so nor was Dorothea
less sentimental than her mamma She knew everything regarding the
literature of Albion as she was pleased to call it and asked me news
of all the famous writers there I told her that Miss Edgeworth was one
of the loveliest young beauties at our court I described to her Lady
Morgan herself as beautiful as the wild Irish girl she drew I promised
to give her a signature of Mrs Hemans which I wrote for her that very
evening and described a foxhunt at which I had seen Thomas Moore
and Samuel Rogers Esquires and a boxingmatch in which the athletic
author of Pelham was pitched against the hardy mountain bard
Wordsworth You see my education was not neglected for though I have
never read the works of the abovenamed ladies and gentlemen yet I knew
their names well enough

Time passed away I perhaps was never so brilliant in conversation as
when excited by the Asmanshauser and the brilliant eyes of Dorothea that
day She and her parents had dined at their usual heathen hour but I
was I dont care to own it so smitten that for the first time in my
life I did not even miss the meal and talked on until six oclock when
tea was served Madame Speck said they always drank it and so placing
a teaspoonful of bohea in a cauldron of water she placidly handed out
this decoction which we took with cakes and tartines I leave you to
imagine how disgusted Klingenspohr and Schnabel looked when they stepped
in as usual that evening to make their party of whist with the Speck
family Down they were obliged to sit and the lovely Dorothea for that
night declined to play altogether andsat on the sofa by me

What we talked about who shall tell I would not for my part break
the secret of one of those delicious conversations of which I and every
man in his time have held so many You begin very probably about the
weathertis a common subject but what sentiments the genius of Love
can fling into it I have often for my part said to the girl of my
heart for the time being Its a fine day or Its a rainy morning
in a way that has brought tears to her eyes Something beats in your
heart and twangle a corresponding string thrills and echoes in
hers You offer her anythingher knittingneedles a slice of
breadandbutterwhat causes the grateful blush with which she accepts
the one or the other Why she sees your heart handed over to her upon
the needles and the breadandbutter is to her a sandwich with love
inside it If you say to your grandmother Maam its a fine day
or what not she would find in the words no other meaning than their
outward and visible one but say so to the girl you love and she
understands a thousand mystic meanings in them Thus in a word though
Dorothea and I did not probably on the first night of our meeting
talk of anything more than the weather or trumps or some subjects
which to such listeners as Schnabel and Klingenspohr and others might
appear quite ordinary yet to US they had a different signification of
which Love alone held the key

Without further ado then after the occurrences of that evening I
determined on staying at Kalbsbraten and presenting my card the next
day to the HofMarshal requesting to have the honor of being presented
to his Highness the Prince at one of whose courtballs my Dorothea
appeared as I have described her

It was summer when I first arrived at Kalbsbraten The little court was
removed to Siegmundslust his Highnesss countryseat no balls were
taking place and in consequence I held my own with Dorothea pretty
well I treated her admirer Lieutenant Klingenspohr with perfect
scorn had a manifest advantage over Major Schnabel and used somehow
to meet the fair one every day walking in company with her mamma in
the palace garden or sitting under the acacias with Belotte in her
mothers lap and the favorite romance beside her Dear dear Dorothea
what a number of novels she must have read in her time She confesses to
me that she had been in love with Uncas with Saint Preux with Ivanhoe
and with hosts of German heroes of romance and when I asked her if
she whose heart was so tender towards imaginary youths had never had
a preference for any one of her living adorers she only looked and
blushed and sighed and said nothing

You see I had got on as well as man could do until the confounded court
season and the balls began and thenwhy then came my usual luck

Waltzing is a part of a German girls life With the best will in the
worldwhich I doubt not she entertains for me for I never put the
matter of marriage directly to herDorothea could not go to balls and
not waltz It was madness to me to see her whirling round the room
with officers attaches prim little chamberlains with gold keys and
embroidered coats her hair floating in the wind her hand reposing upon
the abominable little dancers epaulet her goodhumored face lighted up
with still greater satisfaction I saw that I must learn to waltz too
and took my measures accordingly

The leader of the ballet at the Kalbsbraten theatre in my time was
Springbock from Vienna He had been a regular zephyr once twas said
in his younger days and though he is now fifteen stone weight I can
helas recommend him conscientiously as a master and I determined to
take some lessons from him in the art which I had neglected so foolishly
in early life

It may be said without vanity that I was an apt pupil and in the
course of half a dozen lessons I had arrived at very considerable
agility in the waltzing line and could twirl round the room with him
at such a pace as made the old gentleman pant again and hardly left him
breath enough to puff out a compliment to his pupil I may say that in
a single week I became an expert waltzer but as I wished when I came
out publicly in that character to be quite sure of myself and as I had
hitherto practised not with a lady but with a very fat old man it was
agreed that he should bring a lady of his acquaintance to perfect me
and accordingly at my eighth lesson Madame Springbock herself came to
the dancingroom and the old zephyr performed on the violin

If any man ventures the least sneer with regard to this lady or dares
to insinuate anything disrespectful to her or myself I say at once that
he is an impudent calumniator Madame Springbock is old enough to be my
grandmother and as ugly a woman as I ever saw but though old she was
passionnee pour la danse and not having on account doubtless of her
age and unprepossessing appearance many opportunities of indulging in
her favorite pastime made up for lost time by immense activity
whenever she could get a partner In vain at the end of the hour would
Springbock exclaim Amalia my souls blessing the time is up Play
on dear Alphonso would the old lady exclaim whisking me round and
though I had not the least pleasure in such a homely partner yet for
the sake of perfecting myself I waltzed and waltzed with her until we
were both half dead with fatigue

At the end of three weeks I could waltz as well as any man in Germany

At the end of four weeks there was a grand ball at court in honor of H
H the Prince of Dummerland and his Princess and THEN I determined
I would come out in public I dressed myself with unusual care and
splendor My hair was curled and my moustache dyed to a nicety and
of the four hundred gentlemen present if the girls of Kalbsbraten DID
select one who wore an English hussar uniform why should I disguise the
fact In spite of my silence the news had somehow got abroad as news
will in such small townsHerr von FitzBoodle was coming out in a
waltz that evening His Highness the Duke even made an allusion to the
circumstance When on this eventful night I went as usual and made
him my bow in the presentation Vous monsieur said hevous qui
etes si jeune devez aimer la danse I blushed as red as my trousers
and bowing went away

I stepped up to Dorothea Heavens how beautiful she looked and how
archly she smiled as with a thumping heart I asked her hand for a
WALTZ She took out her little motherofpearl dancingbook she wrote
down my name with her pencil we were engaged for the fourth waltz and
till then I left her to other partners

Who says that his first waltz is not a nervous moment I vow I was
more excited than by any duel I ever fought I would not dance any
contredanse or galop I repeatedly went to the buffet and got glasses
of punch dear simple Germany tis with rumpunch and eggflip thy
children strengthen themselves for the dance I went into the ballroom
and lookedthe couples bounded before me the music clashed and rung
in my earsall was fiery feverish indistinct The gleaming white
columns the polished oaken floors in which the innumerable tapers were
reflectedall together swam before my eyes and I was in a pitch of
madness almost when the fourth waltz at length came WILL YOU DANCE
WITH YOUR SWORD ON said the sweetest voice in the world I blushed
and stammered and trembled as I laid down that weapon and my cap and
hark the music began

Oh how my hand trembled as I placed it round the waist of Dorothea
With my left hand I took her rightdid she squeeze it I think she
didto this day I think she did Away we went we tripped over the
polished oak floor like two young fairies Courage monsieur said
she with her sweet smile Then it was Tres bien monsieur Then I
heard the voices humming and buzzing about Il danse bien lAnglais
Ma foi oui says another On we went twirling and twisting and
turning and whirling couple after couple dropped panting off Little
Klingenspohr himself was obliged to give in All eyes were upon uswe
were going round ALONE Dorothea was almost exhausted when

    

I have been sitting for two hours since I marked the asterisks
thinkingthinking I have committed crimes in my lifewho hasnt But
talk of remorse what remorse is there like THAT which rushes up in a
flood to my brain sometimes when I am alone and causes me to blush when
Im abed in the dark

I fell sir on that infernal slippery floor Down we came like shot we
rolled over and over in the midst of the ballroom the music going
ten miles an hour 800 pairs of eyes fixed upon us a cursed shriek of
laughter bursting out from all sides Heavens how clear I heard it as
we went on rolling and rolling My child my Dorothea shrieked out
Madame Speck rushing forward and as soon as she had breath to do
so Dorothea of course screamed too then she fainted then she was
disentangled from out my spurs and borne off by a bevy of tittering
women Clumsy brute said Madame Speck turning her fat back upon me
I remained upon my seant wild ghastly looking about It was all up
with meI knew it was I wished I could have died there and I wish so
still

Klingenspohr married her that is the long and short but before that
event I placed a sabrecut across the young scoundrels nose which
destroyed HIS beauty for ever

O Dorothea you cant forgive meyou oughtnt to forgive me but I love
you madly still

My next flame was Ottilia but let us keep her for another number my
feelings overpower me at present




OTTILIA


CHAPTER I

THE ALBUMTHE MEDITERRANEAN HEATH


Travelling some little time back in a wild part of Connemara where
I had been for fishing and sealshooting I had the good luck to get
admission to the chateau of a hospitable Irish gentleman and to procure
some news of my once dear Ottilia

Yes of no other than Ottilia v Schlippenschlopp the Muse of
KalbsbratenPumpernickel the friendly little town far away in
Sachsenlandwhere old Speck built the town pump where Klingenspohr
was slashed across the nosewhere Dorothea rolled over and over in
that horrible waltz with FitzBooPshaaway with the recollection
but wasnt it strange to get news of Ottilia in the wildest corner of
Ireland where I never should have thought to hear her gentle name
Walking on that very Urrisbeg Mountain under whose shadow I heard
Ottilias name Mackay the learned author of the Flora Patlandica
discovered the Mediterranean heathsuch a flower as I have often
plucked on the sides of Vesuvius and as Proserpine no doubt amused
herself in gathering as she strayed in the fields of Enna Here it
isthe selfsame flower peering out at the Atlantic from Roundstone
Bay here too in this wild lonely place nestles the fragrant memory
of my Ottilia

In a word after a day on Ballylynch Lake where with a brown fly and
a single hair I killed fourteen salmon the smallest twentynine pounds
weight the largest somewhere about five stone ten my young friend
Blake Bodkin Lynch Browne a fine lad who has made his continental tour
and I adjourned after dinner to the young gentlemans private room
for the purpose of smoking a certain cigar which is never more pleasant
than after a hard days sport or a day spent indoors or after a good
dinner or a bad one or at night when you are tired or in the morning
when you are fresh or of a cold winters day or of a scorching
summers afternoon or at any other moment you choose to fix upon

What should I see in Blakes room but a rack of pipes such as are to
be found in almost all the bachelors rooms in Germany and amongst them
was a porcelain pipehead bearing the image of the Kalbsbraten pump
There it was the old spout the old familiar allegory of Mars Bacchus
Apollo virorum and the rest that I had so often looked at from
Hofarchitect Specks window as I sat there by the side of Dorothea
The old gentleman had given me one of these very pipes for he had
hundreds of them painted wherewith he used to gratify almost every
stranger who came into his native town

Any old place with which I have once been familiar as perhaps I have
before stated in these Confessionsbut never mind that is in some
sort dear to me and were I Lord Shootingcastle or Colonel Popland
I think after a residence of six months there I should love the Fleet
Prison As I saw the old familiar pipe I took it down and crammed it
with Cavendish tobacco and lay down on a sofa and puffed away for an
hour wellnigh thinking of old old times

Youre very entertaining tonight Fitz says young Blake who had
made several tumblers of punch for me which I had gulped down without
saying a word Dont ye think yed be more easy in bed than snorting
and sighing there on my sofa and groaning fit to make me go hang
myself

I am thinking Blake says I about Pumpernickel where old Speck
gave you this pipe

Deed he did replies the young man and did ye know the old Barn

I did said I My friend I have been by the banks of the Bendemeer
Tell me are the nightingales still singing there and do the roses
still bloom

The HWHAT cries Blake What the divvle Fitz are you growling
about Bendemeer Lakes in Westmoreland as I preshume and as for roses
and nightingales I give ye my word its Greek yere talking to me And
Greek it very possibly was for my young friend though as good across
country as any man in his county has not the fine feeling and tender
perception of beauty which may be found elsewhere dear madam

Tell me about Speck Blake and Kalbsbraten and Dorothea and
Klingenspohr her husband

He with the cut across the nose is it cries Blake I know him well
and his old wife

His old what sir cries FitzBoodle jumping up from his seat
Klingenspohrs wife oldis he married againIs Dorothea then
dddead

Deadno more dead than you are only I take her to be
fiveandthirty And when a woman has had nine children you know
she looks none the younger and I can tell ye that when she trod on my
corruns at a ball at the Grand Jukes I felt something heavier than a
feather on my foot

Madame de Klingenspohr then replied I hesitating somewhat has
grown ratherrather ststout I could hardly get out the OUT and
trembled I dont know why as I asked the question

Stout begadshe weighs fourteen stone saddle and bridle Thats
right down goes my pipe flop crash falls the tumbler into the fender
Break away my boy and remember whoever breaks a glass here pays a
dozen

The fact was that the announcement of Dorotheas changed condition
caused no small disturbance within me and I expressed it in the abrupt
manner mentioned by young Blake

Roused thus from my reverie I questioned the young fellow about his
residence at Kalbsbraten which has been always since the war a favorite
place for our young gentry and heard with some satisfaction that
Potzdorff was married to the Behrenstein Haabart had left the dragoons
the Crown Prince had broken with the  but mum of what interest are
all these details to the reader who has never been at friendly little
Kalbsbraten

Presently Lynch reaches me down one of the three books that formed his
library the Racing Calendar and a book of fishingflies making up
the remainder of the set And theres my album says he Youll
find plenty of hands in it that youll recognize as you are an old
Pumpernickelaner And so I did in truth it was a little book after
the fashion of German albums in which good simple little ledger every
friend or acquaintance of the owner inscribes a poem or stanza from some
favorite poet or philosopher with the transcribers own name as thus

To the true housefriend and beloved Irelandish youth

Sera nunquam est ad bonos mores via

WACKERBART Professor at the GrandDucal KalbsbratenPumpernickelisch
Gymnasium


Another writes

Wander on roses and forget me not

AMALIA v NACHTMUTZE

GEB v SHALAFROCK


with a flourish and the picture mayhap of a rose Let the reader
imagine some hundreds of these interesting inscriptions and he will
have an idea of the book

Turning over the leaves I came presently on DOROTHEAS hand There
it was the little neat pretty handwriting the dear old upanddown
strokes that I had not looked at for many a long yearthe
Mediterranean heath which grew on the sunniest banks of FitzBoodles
existence and here found dear dear little sprig in rude Galwagian
boglands

Look at the other side of the page says Lynch rather sarcastically
for I dont care to confess that I kissed the name of Dorothea v
Klingenspohr born v Speck written under an extremely feeble passage
of verse Look at the other side of the paper

I did and what do you think I saw

I saw the writing of five of the little Klingenspohrs who have all
sprung up since my time



Ha ha haw screamed the impertinent young Irishman and the story
was all over Connemara and Joyces Country in a day after




CHAPTER II

OTTILIA IN PARTICULAR


Some kind critic who peruses these writings will doubtless have the
goodness to point out that the simile of the Mediterranean heath is
applied to two personages in this chapterto Ottilia and Dorothea and
say Psha the fellow is but a poor unimaginative creature not to be
able to find a simile apiece at least for the girls how much better
would WE have done the business

Well it is a very pretty simile The girls were rivals were beautiful
I loved them bothwhich should have the sprig of heath Mr Cruikshank
who has taken to serious painting is getting ready for the exhibition
a fine piece representing FitzBoodle on the Urrisbeg Mountain county
Galway Ireland with a sprig of heath in his hand hesitating like
Paris on which of the beauties he should bestow it In the background
is a certain animal between two bundles of hay but that I take to
represent the critic puzzled to which of my young beauties to assign
the choice

If Dorothea had been as rich as Miss Coutts and had come to me the next
day after the accident at the ball and said George will you marry
me it must not be supposed I would have done any such thing THAT
dream had vanished for ever rage and pride took the place of love and
the only chance I had of recovering from my dreadful discomfiture was
by bearing it bravely and trying if possible to awaken a little
compassion in my favor I limped home arranging my scheme with great
presence of mind as I actually sat spinning there on the groundI
limped home sent for Pflastersticken the courtsurgeon and addressed
him to the following effect Pflastersticken says I there has been
an accident at court of which you will hear You will send in leeches
pills and the deuce knows what and you will say that I have dislocated
my leg for some days you will state that I am in considerable danger
You are a good fellow and a man of courage I know for which very reason
you can appreciate those qualities in another so mind if you breathe a
word of my secret either you or I must lose a life

Away went the surgeon and the next day all Kalbsbraten knew that I was
on the point of death I had been delirious all night had had eighty
leeches besides I dont know how much medicine but the Kalbsbrateners
knew to a scruple Whenever anybody was ill this little kind society
knew what medicines were prescribed Everybody in the town knew what
everybody had for dinner If Madame Rumpel had her satin dyed ever so
quietly the whole society was on the qui vive if Countess Pultuski
sent to Berlin for a new set of teeth not a person in Kalbsbraten but
what was ready to compliment her as she put them on if Potzdorff paid
his tailors bill or Muffinstein bought a piece of black wax for his
moustaches it was the talk of the little city And so of course was
my accident In their sorrow for my misfortune Dorotheas was quite
forgotten and those eighty leeches saved me I became interesting I
had cards left at my door and I kept my room for a fortnight during
which time I read every one of M Kotzebues plays

At the end of that period I was convalescent though still a little
lame I called at old Specks house and apologized for my clumsiness
with the most admirable coolness I appeared at court and stated calmly
that I did not intend to dance any more and when Klingenspohr grinned
I told that young gentleman such a piece of my mind as led to his
wearing a large stickingplaster patch on his nose which was split as
neatly down the middle as you would split an orange at dessert In a
word what man could do to repair my defeat I did

There is but one thing now of which I am ashamedof those killing
epigrams which I wrote mon Dieu must I own itbut even the fury of
my anger proves the extent of my love against the Speck family
They were handed about in confidence at court and made a frightful
sensation

 IS IT POSSIBLE

 There happened at Schloss Pmprnckel
 A strange mishap our sides to tickle
 And set the people in a roar
 A strange caprice of Fortune fickle
 I never thought at Pumpernickel
 To see a SPECK UPON THE FLOOR


 LA PERFIDE ALBION OR A CAUTION TO WALTZERS

 Come to the dance the Briton said
 And forward Drtha led
 Fair fresh and threeandtwenty
 Ah girls beware of Britons red
 What wonder that it TURNED HER HEAD
 SAT VERBUM SAPIENTI


 REASONS FOR NOT MARRYING

 The lovely Miss S
 Will surely say yes
 Youve only to ask and try
 That subject well quit
 Says Georgy the wit
 IVE A MUCH BETTER SPEC IN MY EYE

This last epigram especially was voted so killing that it flew
like wildfire and I know for a fact that our ChargedAffaires at
Kalbsbraten sent a courier express with it to the Foreign Office in
England whence through our amiable Foreign Secretary Lord Plmrston
it made its way into every fashionable circle nay I have reason to
believe caused a smile on the cheek of Rylty itself Now that Time has
taken away the sting of these epigrams there can be no harm in giving
them and twas well enough then to endeavor to hide under the lash of
wit the bitter pangs of humiliation but my heart bleeds now to think
that I should have ever brought a tear on the gentle cheek of Dorothea

Not content with thiswith humiliating her by satire and with wounding
her accepted lover across the noseI determined to carry my revenge
still farther and to fall in love with somebody else This person was
Ottilia v Schlippenschlopp

Otho Sigismund Freyherr von Schlippenschlopp Knight Grand Cross of
the Ducal Order of the TwoNecked Swan of Pumpernickel of the
PorcetSiflet of Kalbsbraten Commander of the George and BlueBoar of
Dummerland Excellency and High Chancellor of the United Duchies lived
in the second floor of a house in the Schwapsgasse where with his
private income and his revenues as Chancellor amounting together to
some 300L per annum he maintained such a state as very few other
officers of the GrandDucal Crown could exhibit The Baron is married to
Marie Antoinette a Countess of the house of Kartoffelstadt branches
of which have taken root all over Germany He has no sons and but one
daughter the Fraulein OTTILIA

The Chancellor is a worthy old gentleman too fat and wheezy to preside
at the Privy Council fond of his pipe his ease and his rubber His
lady is a very tall and pale Romannosed Countess who looks as gentle
as Mrs Robert Roy where in the novel she is for putting Baillie
Nicol Jarvie into the lake and who keeps the honest Chancellor in the
greatest order The Fraulein Ottilia had not arrived at Kalbsbraten when
the little affair between me and Dorothea was going on or rather had
only just come in for the conclusion of it being presented for the
first time that year at the ball where Iwhere I met with my accident

At the time when the Countess was young it was not the fashion in her
country to educate the young ladies so highly as since they have been
educated and provided they could waltz sew and make puddings they
were thought to be decently bred being seldom called upon for algebra
or Sanscrit in the discharge of the honest duties of their lives But
Fraulein Ottilia was of the modern school in this respect and came back
from the pension at Strasburg speaking all the languages dabbling in
all the sciences an historian a poeta blue of the ultramarinest
sort in a word What a difference there was for instance between
poor simple Dorotheas love of novel reading and the profound
encyclopaedic learning of Ottilia

Before the latter arrived from Strasburg where she had been under the
care of her aunt the canoness Countess Ottilia of Kartoffeldstadt to
whom I here beg to offer my humblest respects Dorothea had passed for
a bel esprit in the little court circle and her little simple stock
of accomplishments had amused us all very well She used to sing Herz
mein Herz and Ten souvienstu in a decent manner ONCE before
heaven I thought her singing better than Grisis and then she had a
little album in which she drew flowers and used to embroider slippers
wonderfully and was very merry at a game of loto or forfeits and had
a hundred small agremens de societe which rendered her an acceptable
member of it

But when Ottilia arrived poor Dollys reputation was crushed in a
month The former wrote poems both in French and German she painted
landscapes and portraits in real oil and she twanged off a rattling
piece of Listz or Kalkbrenner in such a brilliant way that Dora
scarcely dared to touch the instrument after her or ventured after
Ottilia had trilled and gurgled through Una voce or Di piacer
Rossini was in fashion then to lift up her little modest pipe in a
ballad What was the use of the poor thing going to sit in the park
where so many of the young officers used ever to gather round her Whir
Ottilia went by galloping on a chestnut mare with a groom after her and
presently all the young fellows who could buy or hire horseflesh were
prancing in her train

When they met Ottilia would bounce towards her souls darling and
put her hands round her waist and call her by a thousand affectionate
names and then talk of her as only ladies or authors can talk of one
another How tenderly she would hint at Doras little imperfections of
educationhow cleverly she would insinuate that the poor girl had no
wit and thank God no more she had The fact is that do what I will I
see Im in love with her still and would be if she had fifty children
but my passion blinded me THEN and every arrow that fiery Ottilia
discharged I marked with savage joy Dolly thank heaven didnt mind
the wit much she was too simple for that But still the recurrence of
it would leave in her heart a vague indefinite feeling of pain and
somehow she began to understand that her empire was passing away
and that her dear friend hated her like poison and so she married
Klingenspohr I have written myself almost into a reconciliation with
the silly fellow for the truth is he has been a good honest husband
to her and she has children and makes puddings and is happy

Ottilia was pale and delicate She wore her glistening black hair in
bands and dressed in vapory white muslin She sang her own words to
her harp and they commonly insinuated that she was alone in the
worldthat she suffered some inexpressible and mysterious heartpangs
the lot of all finer geniusesthat though she lived and moved in the
world she was not of it that she was of a consumptive tendency and
might look for a premature interment She even had fixed on the spot
where she should lie the violets grew there she said the river went
moaning by the gray willow whispered sadly over her head and her heart
pined to be at rest Mother she would say turning to her parent
promise mepromise me to lay me in that spot when the parting hour has
come At which Madame de Schlippenschlopp would shriek and grasp her
in her arms and at which I confess I would myself blubber like a
child She had six darling friends at school and every courier from
Kalbsbraten carried off whole reams of her letterpaper

In Kalbsbraten as in every other German town there are a vast number
of literary characters of whom our young friend quickly became the
chief They set up a literary journal which appeared once a week upon
lightblue or primrose paper and which in compliment to the lovely
Ottilias maternal name was called the Kartoffelnkranz Here are a
couple of her ballads extracted from the Kranz and by far the most
cheerful specimen of her style For in her songs she never would
willingly let off the heroines without a suicide or a consumption
She never would hear of such a thing as a happy marriage and had an
appetite for grief quite amazing in so young a person As for her dying
and desiring to be buried under the willowtree of which the first
ballad is the subject though I believed the story then I have at
present some doubts about it For since the publication of my Memoirs
I have been thrown much into the society of literary persons who admire
my style hugely and egad though some of them are dismal enough in
their works I find them in their persons the least sentimental class
that ever a gentleman fell in with

 THE WILLOWTREE


 Know ye the willowtree
 Whose gray leaves quiver
 Whispering gloomily
 To yon pale river
 Lady at eventide
 Wander not near it
 They say its branches hide
 A sad lost spirit

 Once to the willowtree
 A maid came fearful
 Pale seemed her cheek to be
 Her blue eye tearful
 Soon as she saw the tree
 Her step moved fleeter
 No one was thereah me
 No one to meet her

 Quick beat her heart to hear
 The far bells chime
 Toll from the chapeltower
 The trysting time
 But the red sun went down
 In golden flame
 And though she looked round
 Yet no one came

 Presently came the night
 Sadly to greet her
 Moon in her silver light
 Stars in their glitter
 Then sank the moon away
 Under the billow
 Still wept the maid alone
 There by the willow

 Through the long darkness
 By the stream rolling
 Hour after hour went on
 Tolling and tolling
 Long was the darkness
 Lonely and stilly
 Shrill came the nightwind
 Piercing and chilly

 Shrill blew the morning breeze
 Biting and cold
 Bleak peers the gray dawn
 Over the wold
 Bleak over moor and stream
 Looks the grey dawn
 Gray with dishevelled hair
 Still stands the willow there


 THE MAID IS GONE

 Domine Domine
 Sing we a litany
 Sing for poor maidenhearts broken and
 weary
 Domine Domine
 Sing we a litany
 Wail we and weep we a wild Miserere

One of the chief beauties of this ballad for the translation of which I
received some wellmerited compliments is the delicate way in which the
suicide of the poor young woman under the willowtree is hinted at for
that she threw herself into the water and became one among the lilies
of the stream is as clear as a pikestaff Her suicide is committed some
time in the darkness when the slow hours move on tolling and tolling
and is hinted at darkly as befits the time and the deed

But that unromantic brute Van Cutsem the Dutch ChargedAffaires sent
to the Kartoffelnkranz of the week after a conclusion of the ballad
which shows what a poor creature he must be His pretext for writing it
was he said because he could not bear such melancholy endings to poems
and young women and therefore he submitted the following lines

 I

 Long by the willowtrees
 Vainly they sought her
 Wild rang the mothers screams
 Oer the gray water
 Where is my lovely one
 Where is my daughter

 II

 Rouse thee sir constable
 Rouse thee and look
 Fisherman bring your net
 Boatman your hook
 Beat in the lilybeds
 Dive in the brook

 III

 Vainly the constable
 Shouted and called her
 Vainly the fisherman
 Beat the green alder
 Vainly he flung the net
 Never it hauled her

 IV

 Mother beside the fire
 Sat her nightcap in
 Father in easy chair
 Gloomily napping
 When at the windowsill
 Came a light tapping

 V

 And a pale countenance
 Looked through the casement
 Loud beat the mothers heart
 Sick with amazement
 And at the vision which
 Came to surprise her
 Shrieked in an agony
 Lor its Elizar

 VI

 Yes twas Elizabeth
 Yes twas their girl
 Pale was her cheek and her
 Hair out of curl
 Mother the loving one
 Blushing exclaimed
 Let not your innocent
 Lizzy be blamed

 VII

 Yesterday going to aunt
 Joness to tea
 Mother dear mother I
 FORGOT THE DOORKEY
 And as the night was cold
 And the way steep
 Mrs Jones kept me to
 Breakfast and sleep

 VIII

 Whether her Pa and Ma
 Fully believed her
 That we shall never know
 Stern they received her
 And for the work of that
 Cruel though short night
 Sent her to bed without
 Tea for a fortnight

 IX

 MORAL

 Hey diddle diddlety
 Cat and the Fiddlety
 Maidens of England take caution by she
 Let love and suicide
 Never tempt you aside
 And always remember to take the doorkey

Some people laughed at this parody and even preferred it to the
original but for myself I have no patience with the individual who
can turn the finest sentiments of our nature into ridicule and make
everything sacred a subject of scorn The next ballad is less gloomy
than that of the willowtree and in it the lovely writer expresses her
longing for what has charmed us all and as it were squeezes the whole
spirit of the fairy tale into a few stanzas

 FAIRY DAYS

 Beside the old hallfireupon my nurses knee
 Of happy fairy dayswhat tales were told to me
 I thought the world was onceall peopled with princesses
 And my heart would beat to heartheir loves and their distresses
 And many a quiet nightin slumber sweet and deep
 The pretty fairy peoplewould visit me in sleep

 I saw them in my dreamscome flying east and west
 With wondrous fairy giftsthe newborn babe they blessd
 One has brought a jeweland one a crown of gold
 And one has brought a cursebut she is wrinkled and old
 The gentle queen turns paleto hear those words of sin
 But the king he only laughsand bids the dance begin

 The babe has grown to bethe fairest of the land
 And rides the forest greena hawk upon her hand
 An ambling palfrey whitea golden robe and crown
 Ive seen her in my dreamsriding up and down
 And heard the ogre laughas she fell into his snare
 At the little tender creaturewho wept and tore her hair

 But ever when it seemedher need was at the sorest
 A prince in shining mailcomes prancing through the forest
 A waving ostrichplumea buckler burnished bright
 Ive seen him in my dreamsgood sooth a gallant knight
 His lips are coral redbeneath a dark moustache
 See how he waves his handand how his blue eyes flash

 Come forth thou Paynim knighthe shouts in accents clear
 The giant and the maidboth tremble his voice to hear
 Saint Mary guard him wellhe draws his falchion keen
 The giant and the knightare fighting on the green
 I see them in my dreamshis blade gives stroke on stroke
 The giant pants and reelsand tumbles like an oak

 With what a blushing gracehe falls upon his knee
 And takes the ladys handand whispers You are free
 Ah happy childish talesof knight and faerie
 I waken from my dreamsbut theres neer a knight for me
 I waken from my dreamsand wish that I could be
 A child by the old hallfireupon my nurses knee

Indeed Ottilia looked like a fairy herself pale small slim and
airy You could not see her face as it were for her eyes which were
so wild and so tender and shone so that they would have dazzled an
eagle much more a poor goose of a FitzBoodle In the theatre when she
sat on the opposite side of the house those big eyes used to pursue me
as I sat pretending to listen to the Zauberflote or to Don Carlos
or Egmont and at the tender passages especially they would have
such a winning weeping imploring look with them as flesh and blood
could not bear

Shall I tell how I became a poet for the dear girls sake Tis surely
unnecessary after the reader has perused the above versions of her
poems Shall I tell what wild follies I committed in prose as well as
in verse how I used to watch under her window of icy evenings and with
chilblainy fingers sing serenades to her on the guitar Shall I tell
how in a sledgingparty I had the happiness to drive her and of
the delightful privilege which is on these occasions accorded to the
driver

Any reader who has spent a winter in Germany perhaps knows it A large
party of a score or more of sledges is formed Away they go to some
pleasurehouse that has been previously fixed upon where a ball and
collation are prepared and where each man as his partner descends has
the delicious privilege of saluting her O heavens and earth I may grow
to be a thousand years old but I can never forget the rapture of that
salute

The keen air has given me an appetite said the dear angel as we
entered the supperroom and to say the truth fairy as she was she
made a remarkably good mealconsuming a couple of basins of white
soup several kinds of German sausages some Westphalia ham some white
puddings an anchovysalad made with cornichons and onions sweets
innumerable and a considerable quantity of old Steinwein and rumpunch
afterwards Then she got up and danced as brisk as a fairy in which
operation I of course did not follow her but had the honor at the
close of the evenings amusement once more to have her by my side in
the sledge as we swept in the moonlight over the snow

Kalbsbraten is a very hospitable place as far as teaparties are
concerned but I never was in one where dinners were so scarce At the
palace they occurred twice or thrice in a month but on these occasions
spinsters were not invited and I seldom had the opportunity of seeing
my Ottilia except at eveningparties

Nor are these if the truth must be told very much to my taste Dancing
I have forsworn whist is too severe a study for me and I do not like
to play ecarte with old ladies who are sure to cheat you in the course
of an evenings play

But to have an occasional glance at Ottilia was enough and many and
many a napoleon did I lose to her mamma Madame de Schlippenschlopp for
the blest privilege of looking at her daughter Many is the teaparty
I went to shivering into cold clothes after dinner which is my
abomination in order to have one little look at the lady of my soul

At these parties there were generally refreshments of a nature more
substantial than mere tea punch both milk and rum hot wine consomme
and a peculiar and exceedingly disagreeable sandwich made of a mixture
of cold white puddings and garlic of which I have forgotten the name
and always detested the savor

Gradually a conviction came upon me that Ottilia ATE A GREAT DEAL

I do not dislike to see a woman eat comfortably I even think that an
agreeable woman ought to be friande and should love certain little
dishes and knickknacks I know that though at dinner they commonly take
nothing they have had roastmutton with the children at two and laugh
at their pretensions to starvation

No a woman who eats a grain of rice like Amina in the Arabian
Nights is absurd and unnatural but there is a modus in rebus there
is no reason why she should be a ghoul a monster an ogress a horrid
gormandizeressfaugh

It was then with a rage amounting almost to agony that I found
Ottilia ate too much at every meal She was always eating and always
eating too much If I went there in the morning there was the horrid
familiar odor of those oniony sandwiches if in the afternoon dinner
had been just removed and I was choked by reeking reminiscences of
roastmeat Tea we have spoken of She gobbled up more cakes than any
six people present then came the supper and the sandwiches again and
the eggflip and the horrible rumpunch

She was as thin as everpaler if possible than everbut by heavens
HER NOSE BEGAN TO GROW RED

Mon Dieu how I used to watch and watch it Some days it was purple
some days had more of the vermilionI could take an affidavit that
after a heavy nights supper it was more swollen more red than before

I recollect one night when we were playing a round game I had been
looking at her nose very eagerly and sadly for some time she of
herself brought up the conversation about eating and confessed that she
had five meals a day

THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT says I flinging down the cards and springing
up and rushing like a madman out of the room I rushed away into the
night and wrestled with my passion What Marry said I a woman who
eats meat twentyone times in a week besides breakfast and tea Marry a
sarcophagus a cannibal a butchers shopAway I strove and strove
I drank I groaned I wrestled and fought with my lovebut it overcame
me one look of those eyes brought me to her feet again I yielded
myself up like a slave I fawned and whined for her I thought her nose
was not so VERY red

Things came to this pitch that I sounded his Highnesss Minister to know
whether he would give me service in the Duchy I thought of purchasing
an estate there I was given to understand that I should get a
chamberlains key and some post of honor did I choose to remain and
I even wrote home to my brother Tom in England hinting a change in my
condition

At this juncture the town of Hamburg sent his Highness the Grand Duke
apropos of a commercial union which was pending between the two States
a singular present no less than a certain number of barrels of oysters
which are considered extreme luxuries in Germany especially in the
inland parts of the country where they are almost unknown

In honor of the oysters and the new commercial treaty which arrived
in fourgons despatched for the purpose his Highness announced a grand
supper and ball and invited all the quality of all the principalities
round about It was a splendid affair the grand saloon brilliant with
hundreds of uniforms and brilliant toilettesnot the least beautiful
among them I need not say was Ottilia

At midnight the supperrooms were thrown open and we formed into little
parties of six each having a table nobly served with plate a lackey
in attendance and a gratifying icepail or two of champagne to egayer
the supper It was no small cost to serve five hundred people on silver
and the repast was certainly a princely and magnificent one

I had of course arranged with Mademoiselle de Schlippenschlopp
Captains Frumpel and Fridelberger of the Dukes Guard Mesdames de
Butterbrod and Bopp formed our little party

The first course of course consisted of THE OYSTERS Ottilias eyes
gleamed with double brilliancy as the lackey opened them There were
nine apiece for ushow well I recollect the number

I never was much of an oystereater nor can I relish them in
naturalibus as some do but require a quantity of sauces lemons
cayenne peppers bread and butter and so forth to render them
palatable

By the time I had made my preparations Ottilia the Captains and the
two ladies had wellnigh finished theirs Indeed Ottilia had gobbled up
all hers and there were only my nine in the dish

I took oneIT WAS BAD The scent of it was enoughthey were all bad
Ottilia had eaten nine bad oysters

I put down the horrid shell Her eyes glistened more and more she could
not take them off the tray

Dear Herr George she said WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR OYSTERS



She had them all downbeforeI could sayJackRobinson

I left Kalbsbraten that night and have never been there since





FITZBOODLES PROFESSIONS

BEING APPEALS TO THE UNEMPLOYED YOUNGER SONS OF THE NOBILITY




FIRST PROFESSION


The fair and honest proposition in which I offered to communicate
privately with parents and guardians relative to two new and lucrative
professions which I had discovered has I find from the publisher
elicited not one single inquiry from those personages who I cant but
think are very little careful of their childrens welfare to allow
such a chance to be thrown away It is not for myself I speak as my
conscience proudly tells me for though I actually gave up Ascot in
order to be in the way should any father of a family be inclined to
treat with me regarding my discoveries yet I am grieved not on my own
account but on theirs and for the wretched pennywise policy that has
held them back

That they must feel an interest in my announcement is unquestionable
Look at the way in which the public prints of all parties have noticed
my appearance in the character of a literary man Putting aside my
personal narrative look at the offer I made to the nationa choice
of no less than two new professions Suppose I had invented as many new
kinds of butchers meat does any one pretend that the world tired as
it is of the perpetual recurrence of beef mutton veal cold beef cold
veal cold mutton hashed ditto would not have jumped eagerly at the
delightful intelligence that their old stale stupid meals were about
to be varied at last

Of course people would have come forward I should have had deputations
from Mr Gibletts and the fashionable butchers of this world petitions
would have poured in from Whitechapel salesmen the speculators panting
to know the discovery the cautious with stock in hand eager to bribe me
to silence and prevent the certain depreciation of the goods which
they already possessed I should have dealt with them not greedily or
rapaciously but on honest principles of fair barter Gentlemen I
should have said or rather Gentswhich affectionate diminutive
is I am given to understand at present much in use among commercial
personsGents my researches my genius or my good fortune have
brought me to the valuable discovery about which you are come to treat
Will you purchase it outright or will you give the discoverer an honest
share of the profits resulting from your speculation My position in the
world puts ME out of the power of executing the vast plan I have formed
but twill be a certain fortune to him who engages in it and why should
not I too participate in that fortune

Such would have been my manner of dealing with the world too with
regard to my discovery of the new professions Does not the world want
new professions Are there not thousands of welleducated men panting
struggling pushing starving in the old ones Grim tenants of
chambers looking out for attorneys who never comewretched physicians
practising the stale joke of being called out of church until people no
longer think fit even to laugh or to pity Are there not hoaryheaded
midshipmen antique ensigns growing mouldy upon fifty years halfpay
Nay are there not men who would pay anything to be employed rather
than remain idle But such is the glut of professionals the horrible
cutthroat competition among them that there is no chance for one in a
thousand be he ever so willing or brave or clever in the great ocean
of life he makes a few strokes and puffs and sputters and sinks and
the innumerable waves overwhelm him and he is heard of no more

Walking to my bankers tother dayand I pledge my sacred honor this
story is trueI met a young fellow whom I had known attache to an
embassy abroad a young man of tolerable parts unwearied patience with
some fortune too and moreover allied to a noble Whig family whose
interest had procured him his appointment to the legation at Krahwinkel
where I knew him He remained for ten years a diplomatic character
he was the workingman of the legation he sent over the most diffuse
translations of the German papers for the use of the Foreign Secretary
he signed passports with most astonishing ardor he exiled himself
for ten long years in a wretched German town dancing attendance at
courtballs and paying no end of money for uniforms And what for At
the end of the ten yearsduring which period of labor he never received
a single shilling from the Government which employed him rascally
spendthrift of a Government vahe was offered the paid attacheship
to the court of H M the King of the Mosquito Islands and refused that
appointment a week before the Whig Ministry retired Then he knew that
there was no further chance for him and incontinently quitted the
diplomatic service for ever and I have no doubt will sell his uniform
a bargain The Government had HIM a bargain certainly nor is he by any
means the first person who has been sold at that price

Well my worthy friend met me in the street and informed me of these
facts with a smiling countenancewhich I thought a masterpiece of
diplomacy Fortune had been belaboring and kicking him for ten whole
years and here he was grinning in my face could Monsieur de Talleyrand
have acted better I have given up diplomacy said Protocol quite
simply and goodhumoredly for between you and me my good fellow its
a very slow profession sure perhaps but slow But though I gained
no actual pecuniary remuneration in the service I have learned all
the languages in Europe which will be invaluable to me in my new
professionthe mercantile onein which directly I looked out for a
post I found one

What and a good pay said I

Why no thats absurd you know No young men strangers to business
are paid much to speak of Besides I dont look to a paltry clerks
pay Some day when thoroughly acquainted with the business I shall
learn it in about seven years I shall go into a good house with my
capital and become junior partner

And meanwhile

Meanwhile I conduct the foreign correspondence of the eminent house of
Jam Ram and Johnson and very heavy it is I can tell you From nine
till six every day except foreign post days and then from nine till
eleven Dirty dark court to sit in snobs to talk togreat change as
you may fancy

And you do all this for nothing

I do it to learn the business And so saying Protocol gave me a
knowing nod and went his way

Good heavens I thought and is this a true story Are there hundreds
of young men in a similar situation at the present day giving away the
best years of their youth for the sake of a mere windy hope of something
in old age and dying before they come to the goal In seven years he
hopes to have a business and then to have the pleasure of risking his
money He will be admitted into some great house as a particular favor
and three months after the house will fail Has it not happened to a
thousand of our acquaintance I thought I would run after him and tell
him about the new professions that I have invented

Oh ay those you wrote about in Frasers Magazine Egad George
Necessity makes strange fellows of us all Who would ever have thought
of you SPELLING much more writing

Never mind that Will you if I tell you of a new profession that with
a little cleverness and instruction from me you may bring to a most
successful endwill you I say make me a fair return

My dear creature replied young Protocol what nonsense you talk
I saw that very humbug in the Magazine You say you have made a great
discoveryvery good you puff your discoveryvery right you ask money
for itnothing can be more reasonable and then you say that you intend
to make your discovery public in the next number of the Magazine Do you
think I will be such a fool as to give you money for a thing which I can
have next month for nothing Goodby George my boy the NEXT discovery
you make Ill tell you how to get a better price for it And with this
the fellow walked off looking supremely knowing and clever

This tale of the person I have called Protocol is not told without a
purpose you may be sure In the first place it shows what are the
reasons that nobody has made application to me concerning the new
professions namely because I have passed my word to make them known
in this Magazine which persons may have for the purchasing stealing
borrowing or hiring and therefore they will never think of applying
personally to me And secondly his story proves also my assertion
viz that all professions are most cruelly crowded at present and that
men will make the most absurd outlay and sacrifices for the smallest
chance of success at some future period Well then I will be a
benefactor to my race if I cannot be to one single member of it whom
I love better than most men What I have discovered I will make known
there shall be no shillyshallying work here no circumlocution no
bottleconjuring business But oh I wish for all our sakes that I had
had an opportunity to impart the secret to one or two persons only for
after all but one or two can live in the manner I would suggest And
when the discovery is made known I am sure ten thousand will try The
rascals I can see their brassplates gleaming over scores of doors
Competition will ruin my professions as it has all others

It must be premised that the two professions are intended for gentlemen
and gentlemen onlymen of birth and education No others could support
the parts which they will be called upon to play

And likewise it must be honestly confessed that these professions
have to a certain degree been exercised before Do not cry out at this
and say it is no discovery I say it IS a discovery It is a discovery
if I show youa gentlemana profession which you may exercise without
derogation or loss of standing with certain profit nay possibly with
honor and of which until the reading of this present page you never
thought but as of a calling beneath your rank and quite below your
reach Sir I do not mean to say that I create a profession I cannot
create gold but if when discovered I find the means of putting it in
your pocket do I or do I not deserve credit

I see you sneer contemptuously when I mention to you the word
AUCTIONEER Is this all you say that this fellow brags and
prates about An auctioneer forsooth he might as well have invented
chimneysweeping

No such thing A little boy of seven be he ever so low of birth can do
this as well as you Do you suppose that little stolen Master
Montague made a better sweeper than the lowestbred chummy that yearly
commemorates his release No sir And he might have been ever so much
a genius or gentleman and not have been able to make his trade
respectable

But all such trades as can be rendered decent the aristocracy has
adopted one by one At first they followed the profession of arms
flouting all others as unworthy and thinking it ungentlemanlike to
know how to read or write They did not go into the church in very early
days till the money to be got from the church was strong enough to
tempt them It is but of later years that they have condescended to
go to the bar and since the same time only that we see some of them
following trades I know an English lords son who is or was a
winemerchant he may have been a bankrupt for what I know As for
bankers several partners in bankinghouses have four balls to their
coronets and I have no doubt that another sort of banking viz that
practised by gentlemen who lend small sums of money upon deposited
securities will be one day followed by the noble order so that they
may have four balls on their coronets and carriages and three in front
of their shops

Yes the nobles come peoplewards as the people on the other hand rise
and mingle with the nobles With the plebs of course FitzBoodle in
whose veins flows the blood of a thousand kings can have nothing to do
but watching the progress of the world tis impossible to deny that
the good old days of our race are passed away We want money still as
much as ever we did but we cannot go down from our castles with horse
and sword and waylay fat merchantsno no confounded new policemen
and the assizecourts prevent that Younger brothers cannot be pages
to noble houses as of old they were serving gentle dames without
disgrace handing my lords rosewater to wash or holding his stirrup
as he mounted for the chase A page forsooth A pretty figure would
George FitzBoodle or any other man of fashion cut in a jacket covered
with sugarloafed buttons and handing in pennypost notes on a silver
tray The plebs have robbed us of THAT trade among others nor I
confess do I much grudge them their trouvaille Neither can we collect
together a few scores of free lances like honest Hugh Calverly in the
Black Princes time or brave Harry Butler of Wallensteins dragoons
and serve this or that prince Peter the Cruel or Henry of Trastamare
Gustavus or the Emperor at our leisure or in default of service
fight and rob on our own gallant account as the good gentlemen of old
did Alas no In South America or Texas perhaps a man might have a
chance that way but in the ancient world no man can fight except in the
kings service and a mighty bad service that is too and the lowest
European sovereign were it Baldomero Espartero himself would think
nothing of seizing the bestborn condottiere that ever drew sword and
shooting him down like the vulgarest deserter

What then is to be done We must discover fresh fields of
enterpriseof peaceable and commercial enterprise in a peaceful and
commercial age I say then that the auctioneers pulpit has never yet
been ascended by a scion of the aristocracy and am prepared to prove
that they might scale it and do so with dignity and profit

For the auctioneers pulpit is just the peculiar place where a man of
social refinement of elegant wit of polite perceptions can bring
his wit his eloquence his taste and his experience of life most
delightfully into play It is not like the bar where the better and
higher qualities of a man of fashion find no room for exercise In
defending John Jorrocks in an action of trespass for cutting down a
stick in Sam Snookss field what powers of mind do you requirepowers
of mind that is which Mr Serjeant Snorter a butchers son with a
great loud voice a sizar at Cambridge a wrangler and so forth
does not possess as well as yourself Snorter has never been in decent
society in his life He thinks the barmess the most fashionable
assemblage in Europe and the jokes of grand day the ne plus ultra of
wit Snorter lives near Russell Square eats beef and Yorkshirepudding
is a judge of portwine is in all social respects your inferior
Well it is ten to one but in the case of Snooks v Jorrocks before
mentioned he will be a better advocate than you he knows the law of
the case entirely and better probably than you He can speak long
loud to the point grammaticallymore grammatically than you no
doubt will condescend to do In the case of Snooks v Jorrocks he is
all that can be desired And so about dry disputes respecting real
property he knows the law and beyond this has no more need to be
a gentleman than my bodyservant haswho by the way from constant
intercourse with the best society IS almost a gentleman But this is
apart from the question

Now in the matter of auctioneering this I apprehend is not the case
and I assert that a highbred gentleman with good powers of mind and
speech must in such a profession make a fortune I do not mean in all
auctioneering matters I do not mean that such a person should be called
upon to sell the goodwill of a publichouse or discourse about the
value of the beerbarrels or bars with pewter fittings or the beauty
of a trade doing a stroke of so many hogsheads a week I do not ask a
gentleman to go down and sell pigs ploughs and carthorses at Stoke
Pogis or to enlarge at the AuctionRooms Wapping upon the beauty of
the Lively Sally schooner These articles of commerce or use can be
better appreciated by persons in a different rank of life to his

But there are a thousand cases in which a gentleman only can do justice
to the sale of objects which the necessity or convenience of the genteel
world may require to change hands All articles properly called of taste
should be put under his charge Pictureshe is a travelled man has
seen and judged the best galleries of Europe and can speak of them as
a common person cannot For mark you you must have the confidence
of your society you must be able to be familiar with them to plant a
happy mot in a graceful manner to appeal to my lord or the duchess in
such a modest easy pleasant way as that her grace should not be hurt
by your allusion to hernay amused like the rest of the company by
the manner in which it was done

What is more disgusting than the familiarity of a snob What more
loathsome than the swaggering quackery of some present holders of the
hammer There was a late sale for instance which made some noise in
the world I mean the late Lord Gimcracks at Dilberry Hill Ah what
an opportunity was lost there I declare solemnly that I believe but
for the absurd quackery and braggadocio of the advertisements much
more money would have been bid people were kept away by the vulgar
trumpeting of the auctioneer and could not help thinking the things
were worthless that were so outrageously lauded

They say that sort of Bartholomewfair advocacy in which people
are invited to an entertainment by the medium of a hoarse yelling
beefeater twentyfour drums and a jackpudding turning head over
heels is absolutely necessary to excite the public attention What an
error I say that the refined individual so accosted is more likely to
close his ears and shuddering run away from the booth Poor Horace
Waddlepoodle to think that thy gentle accumulation of bricabrac should
have passed away in such a manner by means of a man who brings down
a butterfly with a blunderbuss and talks of a pins head through a
speakingtrumpet Why the auctioneers very voice was enough to crack
the Sevres porcelain and blow the lace into annihilation Let it be
remembered that I speak of the gentleman in his public character merely
meaning to insinuate nothing more than I would by stating that Lord
Brougham speaks with a northern accent or that the voice of Mr Shell
is sometimes unpleasantly shrill

Now the character I have formed to myself of a great auctioneer is this
I fancy him a man of firstrate and irreproachable birth and fashion I
fancy his person so agreeable that it must be a pleasure for ladies to
behold and tailors to dress it As a private man he must move in the
very best society which will flock round his pulpit when he mounts
it in his public calling It will be a privilege for vulgar people to
attend the hall where he lectures and they will consider it an honor to
be allowed to pay their money for articles the value of which is stamped
by his high recommendation Nor can such a person be a mere fribble nor
can any loose hangeron of fashion imagine he may assume the character
The gentleman auctioneer must be an artist above all adoring his
profession and adoring it what must he not know He must have a good
knowledge of the history and language of all nations not the knowledge
of the mere critical scholar but of the lively and elegant man of
the world He will not commit the gross blunders of pronunciation that
untravelled Englishmen perpetrate he will not degrade his subject by
coarse eulogy or sicken his audience with vulgar banter He will know
where to apply praise and wit properly he will have the tact only
acquired in good society and know where a joke is in place and how far
a compliment may go He will not outrageously and indiscriminately laud
all objects committed to his charge for he knows the value of praise
that diamonds could we have them by the bushel would be used as coals
that above all he has a character of sincerity to support that he
is not merely the advocate of the person who employs him but that the
public is his client too who honors him and confides in him Ask him
to sell a copy of Raffaelle for an original a trumpery modern Brussels
counterfeit for real old Mechlin some common French forged crockery for
the old delightful delicate Dresden china and he will quit you with
scorn or order his servant to show you the door of his study

Study by the wayno study is a vulgar word every word is vulgar
which a man uses to give the world an exaggerated notion of himself or
his condition When the wretched bagman brought up to give evidence
before Judge Coltman was asked what his trade was and replied that he
represented the house of Dobson and Hobson he showed himself to be
a vulgar meansouled wretch and was most properly reprimanded by his
lordship To be a bagman is to be humble but not of necessity vulgar
Pomposity is vulgar to ape a higher rank than your own is vulgar for
an ensign of militia to call himself captain is vulgar or for a bagman
to style himself the representative of Dobson and Hobson The honest
auctioneer then will not call his room his study but his private
room or his office or whatever may be the phrase commonly used among
auctioneers

He will not for the same reason call himself as once in a momentary
feeling of pride and enthusiasm for the profession I thought he
shouldhe will not call himself an advocate but an auctioneer
There is no need to attempt to awe people by big titles let each man
bear his own name without shame And a very gentlemanlike and agreeable
though exceptional position for it is clear that there cannot be more
than two of the class may the auctioneer occupy

He must not sacrifice his honesty then either for his own sake or his
clients in any way nor tell fibs about himself or them He is by no
means called upon to draw the long bow in their behalf all that his
office obliges him to doand let us hope his disposition will lead him
to do it alsois to take a favorable kindly philanthropic view of the
world to say what can fairly be said by a goodnatured and ingenious
man in praise of any article for which he is desirous to awaken public
sympathy And how readily and pleasantly may this be done I will take
upon myself for instance to write an eulogium upon SoandSos last
novel which shall be every word of it true and which work though
to some discontented spirits it might appear dull may be shown to be
really amusing and instructivenay IS amusing and instructiveto
those who have the art of discovering where those precious qualities
lie

An auctioneer should have the organ of truth large of imagination and
comparison considerable of wit great of benevolence excessively
large

And how happy might such a man be and cause others to be He should go
through the world laughing merry observant kindhearted He should
love everything in the world because his profession regards everything
With books of lighter literature for I do not recommend the genteel
auctioneer to meddle with heavy antiquarian and philological works he
should be elegantly conversant being able to give a neat history of
the author a pretty sparkling kind criticism of the work and an
appropriate eulogium upon the binding which would make those people
read who never read before or buy at least which is his first
consideration Of pictures we have already spoken Of china of jewelry
of goldheaded canes valuable arms picturesque antiquities with what
eloquent entrainement might he not speak He feels every one of these
things in his heart He has all the tastes of the fashionable world Dr
Meyrick cannot be more enthusiastic about an old suit of armor than
he Sir Harris Nicolas not more eloquent regarding the gallant times in
which it was worn and the brave histories connected with it He takes
up a pearl necklace with as much delight as any beauty who was sighing
to wear it round her own snowy throat and hugs a china monster with
as much joy as the oldest duchess could do Nor must he affect these
things he must feel them He is a glass in which all the tastes of
fashion are reflected He must be every one of the characters to whom
he addresses himselfa genteel Goethe or Shakspeare a fashionable
worldspirit

How can a man be all this and not be a gentleman and not have had an
education in the midst of the best companyan insight into the most
delicate feelings and wants and usages The pulpit oratory of such a
man would be invaluable people would flock to listen to him from
far and near He might out of a single teacup cause streams of
worldphilosophy to flow which would be drunk in by grateful thousands
and draw out of an old pincushion points of wit morals and experience
that would make a nation wise

Look round examine THE ANNALS OF AUCTIONS as Mr Robins remarks
and with every respect for him and his brethren say is there in the
profession SUCH A MAN Do we want such a man Is such a man likely or
not likely to make an immense fortune Can we get such a man except out
of the very best society and among the most favored there

Everybody answers No I knew you would answer no And now gentlemen
who have laughed at my pretension to discover a profession say have
I not I have laid my finger upon the spot where the social deficit
exists I have shown that we labor under a want and when the world
wants do we not know that a man will step forth to fill the vacant
space that Fate has left for him Pass we now to the




SECOND PROFESSION


This profession too is a great lofty and exceptional one and
discovered by me considering these things and deeply musing upon the
necessities of society Nor let honorable gentlemen imagine that I am
enabled to offer them in this profession more than any other a promise
of what is called future glory deathless fame and so forth All that
I say is that I can put young men in the way of making a comfortable
livelihood and leaving behind them not a name but what is better a
decent maintenance to their children FitzBoodle is as good a name as
any in England General FitzBoodle who in Marlboroughs time and
in conjunction with the famous Van Slaap beat the French in the
famous action of Vischzouchee near Mardyk in Holland on the 14th of
February 1709 is promised an immortality upon his tomb in Westminster
Abbey but he died of apoplexy deucedly in debt two years afterwards
and what after that is the use of a name

No no the age of chivalry is past Take the twentyfour first men who
come into the club and ask who they are and how they made their money
Theres WoolseySackville his father was Lord Chancellor and sat
on the woolsack whence he took his title his grandfather dealt in
coalsacks and not in woolsackssmall coalsacks dribbling out
little supplies of black diamonds to the poor Yonder comes Frank
Leveson in a huge broadbrimmed hat his shirtcuffs turned up to his
elbows Leveson is as gentlemanly a fellow as the world contains and if
he has a fault is perhaps too finikin Well you fancy him related to
the Sutherland family nor indeed does honest Frank deny it but entre
nous my good sir his father was an attorney and his grandfather
a bailiff in Chancery Lane bearing a name still older than that of
Leveson namely Levy So it is that this confounded equality grows and
grows and has laid the good old nobility by the heels Look at that
venerable Sir Charles Kitely of Kitely Park he is interested about the
Ashantees and is just come from Exeter Hall Kitely discounted bills
in the City in the year 1787 and gained his baronetcy by a loan to the
French princes All these points of history are perfectly well known
and do you fancy the world cares Psha Profession is no disgrace to
a man be what you like provided you succeed If Mr Fauntleroy could
come to life with a million of money you and I would dine with him you
know we would for why should we be better than our neighbors

Put then out of your head the idea that this or that profession is
unworthy of you take any that may bring you profit and thank him that
puts you in the way of being rich

The profession I would urge upon a person duly qualified to undertake
it has I confess at the first glance something ridiculous about
it and will not appear to young ladies so romantic as the calling of a
gallant soldier blazing with glory gold lace and vermilion coats
or a dear delightful clergyman with a sweet blue eye and a
pockethandkerchief scented charmingly with lavenderwater The
profession I allude to WILL I own be to young women disagreeable to
sober men trivial to great stupid moralists unworthy

But mark my words for it that in the religious world I have once or
twice by mistake no doubt had the honor of dining in serious houses
and can vouch for the fact that the dinners there are of excellent
qualityin the serious world in the great mercantile world among the
legal community notorious feeders in every house in town except some
halfdozen which can afford to do without such aid the man I propose
might speedily render himself indispensable

Does the reader now begin to take Have I hinted enough for him that
he may see with eagle glance the immense beauty of the profession I am
about to unfold to him We have all seen Gunter and Chevet Fregoso on
the Puerta del Sol a relation of the exMinister Calomarde is a good
purveyor enough for the benighted ollaeaters of Madrid nor have I any
fault to find with Guimard a Frenchman who has lately set up in the
Toledo at Naples where he furnishes people with decent food It has
given me pleasure too in walking about Londonin the Strand
in Oxford Street and elsewhere to see fournisseurs and
comestiblemerchants newly set up Messrs Morel have excellent articles
in their warehouses Fortnum and Mason are known to most of my readers

But what is not known what is wanted what is languished for in England
is a DINNERMASTERa gentleman who is not a provider of meat or wine
like the parties before named who can have no earthly interest in
the price of truffled turkeys or dry champagne beyond that legitimate
interest which he may feel for his client and which leads him to see
that the latter is not cheated by his tradesmen For the dinnergiver is
almost naturally an ignorant man How in mercys name can Mr Serjeant
Snorter who is all day at Westminster or in chambers know possibly
the mysteries the delicacy of dinnergiving How can Alderman Pogson
know anything beyond the fact that venison is good with currant jelly
and that he likes lots of green fat with his turtle Snorter knows
law Pogson is acquainted with the state of the tallowmarket but what
should he know of eating like you and me who have given up our time
to it I say ME only familiarly for I have only reached so far in
the science as to know that I know nothing But men there are gifted
individuals who have spent years of deep thoughtnot merely
intervals of labor but hours of study every dayover the gormandizing
sciencewho like alchemists have let their fortunes go guinea by
guinea into the alldevouring potwho ruined as they sometimes are
never get a guinea by chance but they will have a plate of pease in May
with it or a little feast of ortolans or a piece of Gloster salmon
or one more flask from their favorite claretbin

It is not the ruined gastronomist that I would advise a person to select
as his TABLEMASTER for the opportunities of peculation would be too
great in a position of such confidencesuch complete abandonment of
one man to another A ruined man would be making bargains with the
tradesmen They would offer to cash bills for him or send him opportune
presents of wine which he could convert into money or bribe him in one
way or another Let this be done and the profession of tablemaster is
ruined Snorter and Pogson may almost as well order their own dinners
as be at the mercy of a gastronomic agent whose faith is not beyond
all question

A vulgar mind in reply to these remarks regarding the gastronomic
ignorance of Snorter and Pogson might say True these gentlemen know
nothing of household economy being occupied with other more important
business elsewhere But what are their wives about Lady Pogson in
Harley Street has nothing earthly to do but to mind her poodle and her
mantuamakers and housekeepers bills Mrs Snorter in Belford Place
when she has taken her drive in the Park with the young ladies may
surely have time to attend to her husbands guests and preside over
the preparations of his kitchen as she does worthily at his hospitable
mahogany To this I answer that a man who expects a woman to
understand the philosophy of dinnergiving shows the strongest evidence
of a low mind He is unjust towards that lovely and delicate creature
woman to suppose that she heartily understands and cares for what she
eats and drinks No taken as a rule women have no real appetites
They are children in the gormandizing way loving sugar sops tarts
trifles apricotcreams and such gewgaws They would take a sip of
Malmsey and would drink currantwine just as happily if that accursed
liquor were presented to them by the butler Did you ever know a
woman who could lay her fair hand upon her gentle heart and say on her
conscience that she preferred dry sillery to sparkling champagne Such
a phenomenon does not exist They are not made for eating and drinking
or if they make a pretence to it become downright odious Nor can
they I am sure witness the preparations of a really great repast
without a certain jealousy They grudge spending money ask guards
coachmen innwaiters whether this be not the case They will give
their all heaven bless them to serve a son a grandson or a
dear relative but they have not the heart to pay for small things
magnificently They are jealous of good dinners and no wonder I have
shown in a former discourse how they are jealous of smoking and other
personal enjoyments of the male I say then that Lady Pogson or Mrs
Snorter can never conduct their husbands table properly Fancy either
of them consenting to allow a calf to be stewed down into gravy for one
dish or a dozen hares to be sacrificed to a single puree of game or
the best Madeira to be used for a sauce or half a dozen of champagne to
boil a ham in They will be for bringing a bottle of Marsala in place of
the old particular or for having the ham cooked in water But of
these mattersof kitchen philosophyI have no practical or theoretic
knowledge and must beg pardon if only understanding the goodness of a
dish when cooked I may have unconsciously made some blunder regarding
the preparation

Let it then be set down as an axiom without further trouble of
demonstration that a woman is a bad dinnercaterer either too great
and simple for it or too meanI dont know which it is and gentlemen
according as they admire or contemn the sex may settle that matter
their own way In brief the mental constitution of lovely woman is such
that she cannot give a great dinner It must be done by a man It cant
be done by an ordinary man because he does not understand it Vain
fool and he sends off to the pastrycook in Great Russell Street or
Baker Street he lays on a couple of extra waiters greengrocers in the
neighborhood he makes a great pother with his butler in the cellar
and fancies he has done the business

Bon Dieu Who has not been at those dinnersthose monstrous
exhibitions of the pastrycooks art Who does not know those made
dishes with the universal sauce to each fricandeaux sweetbreads damp
dumpy cutlets c seasoned with the compound of grease onions bad
portwine cayenne pepper currypowder Warrens blacking for what
I know but the taste is always the samethere they lie in the old
corner dishes the poor wiry Moselle and sparkling Burgundy in the
icecoolers and the old story of white and brown soup turbot little
smelts boiled turkey saddleofmutton and so forth Try a little of
that fricandeau says Mrs Snorter with a kind smile Youll find
it I think very nice Be sure it has come in a green tray from Great
Russell Street Mr FitzBoodle you have been in Germany cries
Snorter knowingly taste the hock and tell me what you think of
THAT

How should he know better poor benighted creature or she dear
good soul that she is If they would have a legofmutton and
an applepudding and a glass of sherry and port or simple
brandyandwater called by its own name after dinner all would be very
well but they must shine they must dine as their neighbors There
is no difference in the style of dinners in London people with five
hundred a year treat you exactly as those of five thousand They WILL
have their Moselle or hock their fatal sidedishes brought in the green
trays from the pastrycooks

Well there is no harm done not as regards the dinnergivers at least
though the dinnereaters may have to suffer somewhat it only shows
that the former are hospitably inclined and wish to do the very best in
their powergood honest fellows If they do wrong how can they help
it they know no better

And now is it not as clear as the sun at noonday that A WANT exists
in London for a superintendent of the tablea gastronomic agenta
dinnermaster as I have called him before A man of such a profession
would be a metropolitan benefit hundreds of thousands of people of the
respectable sort people in white waistcoats would thank him daily
Calculate how many dinners are given in the City of London and
calculate the numbers of benedictions that the Agency might win

And as no doubt the observant man of the world has remarked that the
freeborn Englishman of the respectable class is of all others the most
slavish and truckling to a lord that there is no flyblown peer but he
is pleased to have him at his table proud beyond measure to call him
by his surname without the lordly prefix and that those lords whom he
does not know he yet the freeborn Englishman takes care to have their
pedigrees and ages by heart from his worldbible the Peerage as
this is an indisputable fact and as it is in this particular class of
Britons that our agent must look to find clients I need not say it is
necessary that the agent should be as highborn as possible and that he
should be able to tack if possible an honorable or some other handle
to his respectable name He must have it on his professional card

 THE HONORABLE GEORGE GORMAND GOBBLETON

 Apician Chambers Pall Mall


 Or


 SIR AUGUSTUS CARVER CRAMLEY CRAMLEY

 Amphitryonic Council Office Swallow Street

or in some such neat way Gothic letters on a large handsome
crockeryware card with possibly a gilt coatofarms and supporters or
the bloodred hand of baronetcy duly displayed Depend on it plenty of
guineas will fall in it and that Gobbletons supporters will support
him comfortably enough

For this profession is not like that of the auctioneer which I take to
be a far more noble one because more varied and more truthful but in
the Agency case a little humbug at least is necessary A man cannot be
a successful agent by the mere force of his simple merit or genius in
eating and drinking He must of necessity impose upon the vulgar to a
certain degree He must be of that rank which will lead them naturally
to respect him otherwise they might be led to jeer at his profession
but let a noble exercise it and bless your soul all the Court Guide
is dumb

He will then give out in a manly and somewhat pompous address what has
before been mentioned namely that he has seen the fatal way in which
the hospitality of England has been perverted hitherto accapared by
a few cooks with green trays He must use a good deal of French in his
language for that is considered very gentlemanlike by vulgar people
He will take a set of chambers in Canton Gardens which will be richly
though severely furnished and the door of which will be opened by
a French valet he MUST be a Frenchman remember who will say on
letting Mr Snorter or Sir Benjamin Pogson in that MILOR is at
home Pogson will then be shown into a library furnished with massive
bookcases containing all the works on cookery and wines the titles
of them in all the known languages in the world Any books of course
will do as you will have them handsomely bound and keep them under
plateglass On a sidetable will be little samplebottles of wine a
few truffles on a white porcelain saucer a prodigious strawberry or
two perhaps at the time when such fruit costs much money On the
library will be busts marked Ude Careme Bechamel in marble never
mind what heads of course and perhaps on the clock should be a
figure of the Prince of Condes cook killing himself because the fish
had not arrived in time there may be a wreath of immortelles on the
figure to give it a more decidedly Frenchified air The walls will be of
a dark rich paper hung round with neat gilt frames containing plans
of menus of various great dinners those of Cambaceres Napoleon
Louis XIV Louis XVIII Heliogabalus if you like each signed by the
respective cook

After the stranger has looked about him at these things which he does
not understand in the least especially the truffles which look like
dirty potatoes you will make your appearance dressed in a dark dress
with one handsome enormous gold chain and one large diamond ring a
gold snuffbox of course which you will thrust into the visitors paw
before saying a word You will be yourself a portly grave man with
your hair a little bald and gray In fact in this as in all other
professions you had best try to look as like Canning as you can

When Pogson has done sneezing with the snuff you will say to him
Take a fauteuil I have the honor of addressing Sir Benjamin Pogson I
believe And then you will explain to him your system

This of course must vary with every person you address But let us
lay down a few of the heads of a plan which may be useful or may
be modified infinitely or may be cast aside altogether just as
circumstances dictate After all I am not going to turn gastronomic
agent and speak only for the benefit perhaps of the very person who is
reading this

SYNOPSIS OF THE GASTRONOMIC AGENCY OF THE HONORABLE GEORGE GOBBLETON

The Gastronomic Agent having traversed Europe and dined with the best
society of the world has been led naturally as a patriot to turn
his thoughts homeward and cannot but deplore the lamentable ignorance
regarding gastronomy displayed in a country for which Nature has done
almost everything

But it is ever singularly thus Inherent ignorance belongs to man and
The Agent in his Continental travels has always remarked that the
countries most fertile in themselves were invariably worse tilled than
those more barren The Italians and the Spaniards leave their fields to
Nature as we leave our vegetables fish and meat And heavens what
richness do we fling away what dormant qualities in our dishes do
we disregardwhat glorious gastronomic crops if the Agent may
be permitted the expressionwhat glorious gastronomic crops do we
sacrifice allowing our goodly meats and fishes to lie fallow Chance
it is said by an ingenious historian who having been long a secretary
in the East India House must certainly have had access to the best
information upon Eastern mattersChance it is said by Mr
Charles Lamb which burnt down a Chinamans house with a litter of
suckingpigs that were unable to escape from the interior discovered to
the world the excellence of roastpig Gunpowder we know was invented
by a similar fortuity The reader will observe that my style in the
supposed character of a Gastronomic Agent is purposely pompous and
loud So tis said was printingso glassWe should have drunk
our wine poisoned with the villanous odor of the borachio had not
some Eastern merchants lighting their fires in the Desert marked the
strange composition which now glitters on our sideboards and holds the
costly produce of our vines

We have spoken of the natural riches of a country Let the reader think
but for one moment of the gastronomic wealth of our country of England
and he will be lost in thankful amazement as he watches the astonishing
riches poured out upon us from Natures bounteous cornucopia Look at
our fisheriesthe trout and salmon tossing in our brawling streams
the white and fullbreasted turbot struggling in the mariners net the
purple lobster lured by hopes of greed into his basketprison which
he quits only for the red ordeal of the pot Look at whitebait great
heavenslook at whitebait and a thousand frisking glittering
silvery things besides which the nymphs of our native streams bear
kindly to the deities of our kitchensour kitchens such as they are

And though it may be said that other countries produce the
frecklebacked salmon and the dark broadshouldered turbot though trout
frequent many a stream besides those of England and lobsters sprawl
on other sands than ours yet let it be remembered that our native
country possesses these altogether while other lands only know them
separately that above all whitebait is peculiarly our countrysour
citys own Blessings and eternal praises be on it and of course on
brown bread and butter And the Briton should further remember with
honest pride and thankfulness the situation of his capital of London
the lordly turtle floats from the sea into the stream and from the
stream to the city the rapid fleets of all the world se donnent
rendezvous in the docks of our silvery Thames the produce of our coasts
and provincial cities east and west is borne to us on the swift lines
of lightning railroads In a wordand no man but one who like The
Agent has travelled Europe over can appreciate the giftthere is no
city on earths surface so well supplied with fish as London

With respect to our meats all praise is supererogatory Ask the
wretched hunter of chevreuil the poor devourer of rehbraten what they
think of the noble English haunch that after bounding in the Park of
Knole or Windsor exposes its magnificent flank upon some broad silver
platter at our tables It is enough to say of foreign venison that THEY
ARE OBLIGED TO LARD IT Away ours is the palm of roast whether of the
crisp mutton that crops the thymy herbage of our downs or the noble ox
who revels on lush Althorpian oilcakes What game is like to ours Mans
excels us in poultry tis true but tis only in merry England that the
partridge has a flavor that the turkey can almost se passer de truffes
that the jolly juicy goose can be eaten as he deserves

Our vegetables moreover surpass all comment Art by the means of
glass has wrung fruit out of the bosom of Nature such as she grants to
no other clime And if we have no vineyards on our hills we have gold
to purchase their best produce Nature and enterprise that masters
Nature have done everything for our land

But with all these prodigious riches in our power is it not painful
to reflect how absurdly we employ them Can we say that we are in the
habit of dining well Alas no and The Agent roaming oer foreign
lands and seeing how with small means and great ingenuity and
perseverance great ends were effected comes back sadly to his own
country whose wealth he sees absurdly wasted whose energies are
misdirected and whose vast capabilities are allowed to lie idle   
Here should follow what I have only hinted at previously a vivid and
terrible picture of the degradation of our table    Oh for a
master spirit to give an impetus to the land to see its great power
directed in the right way and its wealth not squandered or hidden but
nobly put out to interest and spent

The Agent dares not hope to win that proud stationto be the destroyer
of a barbarous system wallowing in abusive prodigalityto become a
dietetic reformerthe Luther of the table

But convinced of the wrongs which exist he will do his humble endeavor
to set them right and to those who know that they are ignorant and
this is a vast step to knowledge he offers his counsels his active
cooperation his frank and kindly sympathy The Agents qualifications
are these 1 He is of one of the best families in England and has
in himself or through his ancestors been accustomed to good living
for centuries In the reign of Henry V his maternal
greatgreatgrandfather Roger de Gobylton the name may be varied of
course or the kings reign or the dish invented was the first
who discovered the method of roasting a peacock whole with his
tailfeathers displayed and the dish was served to the two kings at
Rouen Sir Walter Cramley in Elizabeths reign produced before
her Majesty when at Killingworth Castle mackerel with the famous
GOOSEBERRY SAUCE c

2 He has through life devoted himself to no other study than that of
the table and has visited to that end the courts of all the monarchs of
Europe taking the receipts of the cooks with whom he lives on terms of
intimate friendship often at enormous expense to himself

3 He has the same acquaintance with all the vintages of the Continent
having passed the autumn of 1811 the comet year on the great Weinberg
of Johannisberg being employed similarly at Bordeaux in 1834 at
Oporto in 1820 and at Xeres de la Frontera with his excellent
friends Duff Gordon and Co the year after He travelled to India and
back in company with fourteen pipes of Madeira on board of the Samuel
Snob East Indiaman Captain Scuttler and spent the vintage season in
the island with unlimited powers of observation granted to him by the
great houses there

4 He has attended Mr Groves of Charing Cross and Mr Giblett of
Bond Street in a course of purchases of fish and meat and is able at
a glance to recognize the age of mutton the primeness of beef the
firmness and freshness of fish of all kinds

5 He has visited the parks the grousemanors and the principal
gardens of England in a similar professional point of view


The Agent then through his subordinates engages to provide gentlemen
who are about to give dinnerparties1 With cooks to dress the
dinners a list of which gentlemen he has by him and will recommend
none who are not worthy of the strictest confidence

2 With a menu for the table according to the price which the
Amphitryon chooses to incur

3 He will through correspondence with the various fournisseurs of
the metropolis provide them with viands fruit wine c sending to
Paris if need be where he has a regular correspondence with Messrs
Chevet

4 He has a list of dexterous tablewaiters all answering to the name
of John for fear of mistakes the butlers name to be settled according
to pleasure and would strongly recommend that the servants of the
house should be locked in the backkitchen or servants hall during the
time the dinner takes place

5 He will receive and examine all the accounts of the
fournisseursof course pledging his honor as a gentleman not to
receive one shilling of paltry gratification from the tradesmen he
employs but to see that the bills are more moderate and their goods of
better quality than they would provide to any person of less experience
than himself

6 His fee for superintending a dinner will be five guineas and The
Agent entreats his clients to trust ENTIRELY to him and his subordinates
for the arrangement of the repastNOT TO THINK of inserting dishes
of their own invention or producing wine from their own cellars as
he engages to have it brought in the best order and fit for immediate
drinking Should the Amphitryon however desire some particular dish
or wine he must consult The Agent in the first case by writing in the
second by sending a sample to The Agents chambers For it is manifest
that the whole complexion of a dinner may be altered by the insertion
of a single dish and therefore parties will do well to mention their
wishes on the first interview with The Agent He cannot be called upon
to recompose his bill of fare except at great risk to the ensemble of
the dinner and enormous inconvenience to himself

7 The Agent will be at home for consultation from ten oclock until
two earlier if gentlemen who are engaged at early hours in the City
desire to have an interview and be it remembered that a PERSONAL
INTERVIEW is always the best for it is greatly necessary to know not
only the number but the character of the guests whom the Amphitryon
proposes to entertainwhether they are fond of any particular wine or
dish what is their state of health rank style profession c

8 At two oclock he will commence his rounds for as the metropolis is
wide it is clear that he must be early in the field in some districts
From 2 to 3 he will be in Russell Square and the neighborhood 3 to 3
34 Harley Street Portland Place Cavendish Square and the environs
3 34 to 4 14 Portman Square Gloucester Place Baker Street c
4 14 to 5 the new district about Hyde Park Terrace 5 to 5 34 St
Johns Wood and the Regents Park He will be in Grosvenor Square by 6
and in Belgrave Square Pimlico and its vicinity by 7 Parties there
are requested not to dine until 8 oclock and The Agent once for all
peremptorily announces that he will NOT go to the palace where it is
utterly impossible to serve a good dinner

TO TRADESMEN

Every Monday evening during the season the Gastronomic Agent proposes
to give a series of trialdinners to which the principal gormands of
the metropolis and a few of The Agents most respectable clients will
be invited Covers will be laid for TEN at nine oclock precisely And
as The Agent does not propose to exact a single shilling of profit from
their bills and as his recommendation will be of infinite value to
them the tradesmen he employs will furnish the weekly dinner gratis
Cooks will attend who have acknowledged characters upon the same
terms To save trouble a book will be kept where butchers poulterers
fishmongers c may inscribe their names in order taking it by turns
to supply the trialtable Winemerchants will naturally compete every
week promiscuously sending what they consider their best samples and
leaving with the hallporter tickets of the prices Confectionery to
be done out of the house Fruiterers marketmen as butchers and
poulterers The Agents maitredhotel will give a receipt to each
individual for the articles he produces and let all remember that The
Agent is a VERY KEEN JUDGE and woe betide those who serve him or his
clients ill

GEORGE GORMAND GOBBLETON

CARLTON GARDENS June 10 1842


Here I have sketched out the heads of such an address as I conceive a
gastronomic agent might put forth and appeal pretty confidently to the
British public regarding its merits and my own discovery If this be not
a professiona new onea feasible onea lucrative oneI dont
know what is Say that a man attends but fifteen dinners daily that
is seventyfive guineas or five hundred and fifty pounds weekly or
fourteen thousand three hundred pounds for a season of six months and
how many of our younger sons have such a capital even Let then some
unemployed gentleman with the requisite qualifications come forward It
will not be necessary that he should have done all that is stated in the
prospectus but at any rate let him SAY he has there cant be much
harm in an innocent fib of that sort for the gastronomic agent must be
a sort of dinnerpope whose opinions cannot be supposed to err

And as he really will be an excellent judge of eating and drinking and
will bring his whole mind to bear upon the question and will speedily
acquire an experience which no person out of the profession can possibly
have and as moreover he will be an honorable man not practising upon
his client in any way or demanding sixpence beyond his just fee the
world will gain vastly by the coming forward of such a persongain in
good dinners and absolutely save money for what is five guineas for a
dinner of sixteen The sum may be gaspille by a cookwench or by one of
those abominable beforenamed pastrycooks with their green trays

If any man take up the business he will invite me of course to the
Monday dinners Or does ingratitude go so far as that a man should
forget the author of his good fortune I believe it does Turn we away
from the sickening theme


And now having concluded my professions how shall I express my
obligations to the discriminating press of this country for the
unanimous applause which hailed my first appearance It is the more
wonderful as I pledge my sacred word I never wrote a document before
much longer than a laundresss bill or the acceptance of an invitation
to dinner But enough of this egotism thanks for praise conferred sound
like vanity gratitude is hard to speak of and at present it swells the
full heart of
