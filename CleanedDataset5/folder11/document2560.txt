THE THREE PARTNERS

By Bret Harte




PROLOGUE


The sun was going down on the Black Spur Range The red light it had
kindled there was still eating its way along the serried crest showing
through gaps in the ranks of pines etching out the interstices of
broken boughs fading away and then flashing suddenly out again like
sparks in burntup paper Then the night wind swept down the whole
mountain side and began its usual struggle with the shadows upclimbing
from the valley only to lose itself in the end and be absorbed in the
allconquering darkness Yet for some time the pines on the long slope
of Heavy Tree Hill murmured and protested with swaying arms but as the
shadows stole upwards and cabin after cabin and tunnel after tunnel
were swallowed up a complete silence followed Only the sky remained
visiblea vast concave mirror of dull steel in which the stars did not
seem to be set but only reflected

A single cabin door on the crest of Heavy Tree Hill had remained open to
the wind and darkness Then it was slowly shut by an invisible figure
afterwards revealed by the embers of the fire it was stirring At first
only this figure brooding over the hearth was shown but as the flames
leaped up two other figures could be seen sitting motionless before it
When the door was shut they acknowledged that interruption by slightly
changing their position the one who had risen to shut the door sank
back into an invisible seat but the attitude of each man was one of
profound reflection or reserve and apparently upon some common subject
which made them respect each others silence However this was at last
broken by a laugh It was a boyish laugh and came from the youngest of
the party The two others turned their profiles and glanced inquiringly
towards him but did not speak

I was thinking he began in apologetic explanation how mighty queer
it was that while we were working like niggers on grub wages without
the ghost of a chance of making a strike how we used to sit here night
after night and flapdoodle and speculate about what wed do if we ever
DID make one and now Great Scott that we HAVE made it and are just
wallowing in gold here we are sitting as glum and silent as if wed
had a washout Why Lord I remember one nightnot so long ago
eitherthat you two quarreled over the swell hotel you were going to
stop at in Frisco and whether you wouldnt strike straight out for
London and Rome and Paris or go away to Japan and China and round by
India and the Red Sea

No we didnt QUARREL over it said one of the figures gently there
was only a little discussion

Yes but you did though returned the young fellow mischievously
and you told Stacy there that wed better learn something of the
world before we tried to buy it or even hire it and that it was just
as well to get the hayseed out of our hair and the slumgullion off our
boots before we mixed in polite society

Well I dont see whats the matter with that sentiment now returned
the second speaker goodhumoredly only he added gravely we didnt
quarrelGod forbid

There was something in the speakers tone which seemed to touch a common
chord in their natures and this was voiced by Barker with sudden and
almost pathetic earnestness I tell you what boys we ought to swear
here tonight to always stand by each otherin luck and out of it We
ought to hold ourselves always at each others call We ought to have
a kind of password or signal you know by which we could summon each
other at any time from any quarter of the globe

Come off the roof Barker murmured Stacy without lifting his eyes
from the fire But Demorest smiled and glanced tolerantly at the younger
man

Yes but look here Stacy continued Barker comrades like us in
the old days used to do that in times of trouble and adventures Why
shouldnt we do it in our luck

Theres a good deal in that Barker boy said Demorest though as
a general thing passwords butter no parsnips and the ordinary
everyday single yelp from a wolf brings the whole pack together for
business about as quick as a password But you cling to that sentiment
and put it away with your golddust in your belt

What I like about Barker is his commodiousness said Stacy Here he
is the only man among us that has his future fixed and his preemption
lines laid out and registered Hes already got a girl that hes going
to marry and settle down with on the strength of his luck And Id like
to know what Kitty Carter when shes Mrs Barker would say to her
husband being signaled for from Asia or Africa I dont seem to see her
tumbling to any password And when he and she go into a new partnership
I reckon shell let the old one slide

Thats just where youre wrong said Barker with quickly rising
color Shes the sweetest girl in the world and shed be sure to
understand our feelings Why she thinks everything of you two she was
just eager for you to get this claim which has put us where we are
when I held back and if it hadnt been for her by Jove we wouldnt
have had it

That was only because she cared for YOU returned Stacy with a
halfyawn and now that youve got YOUR share she isnt going to take
a breathless interest in US And by the way Id rather YOUD remind us
that we owe our luck to her than that SHE should ever remind YOU of it

What do you mean said Barker quickly But Demorest here rose lazily
and throwing a gigantic shadow on the wall stood between the two with
his back to the fire He means he said slowly that youre talking
rot and so is he However as yours comes from the heart and his from
the head I prefer yours But youre both making me tired Lets have a
fresh deal

Nobody ever dreamed of contradicting Demorest Nevertheless Barker
persisted eagerly But isnt it better for us to look at this
cheerfully and happily all round Theres nothing criminal in our having
made a strike It seems to me boys that of all ways of making money
its the squarest and most level nobody is the poorer for it our luck
brings no misfortune to others The gold was put there ages ago for
anybody to find we found it It hasnt been tarnished by mans touch
before I dont know how it strikes you boys but it seems to me
that of all gifts that are going it is the straightest For whether we
deserve it or not it comes to us firsthandfrom God

The two men glanced quickly at the speaker whose face flushed and then
smiled embarrassedly as if ashamed of the enthusiasm into which he had
been betrayed But Demorest did not smile and Stacys eyes shone in the
firelight as he said languidly I never heard that prospecting was a
religious occupation before But I shouldnt wonder if youre right
Barker boy So lets liquor up

Nevertheless he did not move nor did the others The fire leaped
higher bringing out the rude rafters and sternly economic details of
the rough cabin and making the occupants in their seats before the fire
look gigantic by contrast

Who shut the door said Demorest after a pause

I did said Barker I reckoned it was getting cold

Better open it again now that the fires blazing It will light the
way if any of the men from below want to drop in this evening

Stacy stared at his companion I thought that it was understood that
we were giving them that dinner at Boomville tomorrow night so that we
might have the last evening here by ourselves in peace and quietness

Yes but if any one DID want to come it would seem churlish to shut him
out said Demorest

I reckon youre feeling very much as I am said Stacy that this good
fortune is rather crowding to us three alone For myself I know he
continued with a backward glance towards a blanketed covered pile
in the corner of the cabin that I feel rather oppressed byby its
specific gravity I calculateand sort of crampy and twitchy in the
legs as if I ought to lite out and do something and yet it holds
me here All the same I doubt if anybody will come upexcept from
curiosity Our luck has made them rather sore down the hill for all
theyre coming to the dinner tomorrow

Thats only human nature said Demorest

But said Barker eagerly what does it mean Why only this
afternoon when I was passing the Old Kentuck tunnel where those
Marshalls have been grubbing along for four years without making a
single strike I felt ashamed to look at them and as they barely nodded
to me I slinked by as if I had done them an injury I dont understand
it

It somehow does not seem to square with this gift of God idea of
yours does it said Stacy But well open the door and give them a
show

As he did so it seemed as if the night were their only guest and had
been waiting on the threshold to now enter bodily and pervade all things
with its presence With that cool fragrant inflow of air they breathed
freely The red edge had gone from Black Spur but it was even more
clearly defined against the sky in its towering blackness The
sky itself had grown lighter although the stars still seemed mere
reflections of the solitary pinpoints of light scattered along the
concave valley below Mingling with the cooler restful air of the
summit yet penetratingly distinct from it arose the stimulating breath
of the pines below still hot and panting from the daylong sun The
silence was intense The faroff barking of a dog on the invisible
riverbar nearly a mile beneath them came to them like a sound in a
dream They had risen and standing in the doorway by common consent
turned their faces to the east It was the frequent attitude of the
homeremembering miner and it gave him the crowning glory of the view
For beyond the pinehearsed summits rarely seen except against the
evening sky lay a thin white cloud like a dropped portion of the Milky
Way Faint with an indescribable pallor remote yet distinct enough to
assert itself above and beyond all surrounding objects it was always
there It was the snowline of the Sierras

They turned away and silently reseated themselves the same thought
in the minds of each Here was something they could not take away
something to be left forever and irretrievably behindleft with the
healthy life they had been leading the cheerful endeavor the undying
hopefulness which it had fostered and blessed Was what they WERE taking
away worth it And oddly enough frank and outspoken as they had always
been to each other that common thought remained unuttered Even Barker
was silent perhaps he was also thinking of Kitty

Suddenly two figures appeared in the very doorway of the cabin The
effect was startling upon the partners who had only just reseated
themselves and for a moment they had forgotten that the narrow band
of light which shot forth from the open door rendered the darkness on
either side of it more impenetrable and that out of this darkness
although themselves guided by the light the figures had just emerged
Yet one was familiar enough It was the Hill drunkard Dick Hall or
as he was called Whiskey Dick or indicated still more succinctly by
the Hill humorists Alky Hall

Everybody had seen that sodden puffy but goodhumored face everybody
had felt the fiery exhalations of that enormous red beard which always
seemed to be kept in a state of moist unkempt luxuriance by liquor
everybody knew the absurd dignity of manner and attempted precision of
statement with which he was wont to disguise his frequent excesses
Very few however knew or cared to know the pathetic weariness and
chilling horror that sometimes looked out of those bloodshot eyes

He was evidently equally unprepared for the three silent seated figures
before the door and for a moment looked at them blankly with the doubts
of a frequently deceived perception Was he sure that they were quite
real He had not dared to look at his companion for verification but
smiled vaguely

Goodevening said Demorest pleasantly

Whiskey Dicks face brightened Goodevenin goodevenin yourselves
boysand see how you like it Lemme interdrush my ole frien William
J Steptoe of Red Gulch StepshoSteptoeis shtayish stay
He stopped hiccupped waved his hand gravely and with an air of
reproachful dignity concluded sojourning for the present on the Bar
We wish to offer our congrashulashen and felishfelish He paused
again and leaning against the doorpost added severely itations

His companion however laughed coarsely and pushing past Dick
entered the cabin He was a short powerful man with a closely cropped
crust of beard and hair that seemed to adhere to his round head like
moss or lichen He cast a glancefurtive rather than curious around
the cabin and said with a familiarity that had not even good humor
to excuse it So youre the gay galoots whove made the big strike
Thought Id meander up the Hill with this old bloat Alky and drop in
to see the show And here you are feeling your oats eh and not caring
any particular Gd dn if school keeps or not

Show Mr Steptoethe whiskey said Demorest to Stacy Then quietly
addressing Dick but ignoring Steptoe as completely as Steptoe had
ignored his unfortunate companion he said You quite startled us at
first We did not see you come up the trail

No We came up the back trail to please Steptoe who wanted to see
round the cabin said Dick glancing nervously yet with a forced
indifference towards the whiskey which Stacy was offering to the
stranger

What yer gettin off there said Steptoe facing Dick almost brutally
YOU know your tangled legs wouldnt take you straight up the trail
and you had to make a circumbendibus Gosh if you hadnt scented this
licker at the top youd have never found it

No matter Im glad you DID find it Dick said Demorest and I hope
youll find the liquor good enough to pay you for the trouble

Barker stared at Demorest This extraordinary tolerance of the drunkard
was something new in his partner But at a glance from Demorest he led
Dick to the demijohn and tin cup which stood on a table in the corner
And in another moment Dick had forgotten his companions rudeness

Demorest remained by the door looking out into the darkness

Well said Steptoe putting down his emptied cup trot out your
strike I reckon our eyes are strong enough to bear it now Stacy drew
the blanket from the vague pile that stood in the corner and discovered
a deep tin prospectingpan It was heaped with several large fragments
of quartz At first the marble whiteness of the quartz and the
glittering crystals of mica in its veins were the most noticeable but
as they drew closer they could see the dull yellow of gold filling the
decomposed and honeycombed portion of the rock as if still liquid and
molten The eyes of the party sparkled like the micaeven those of
Barker and Stacy who were already familiar with the treasure

Which is the richest chunk asked Steptoe in a thickening voice

Stacy pointed it out

Why its smaller than the others

Heft it in your hand said Barker with boyish enthusiasm

The short thick fingers of Steptoe grasped it with a certain aquiline
suggestion his whole arm strained over it until his face grew purple
but he could not lift it

Thar useter be a little game in the Frisco Mint said Dick restored
to fluency by his liquor when thar war ladies visiting it and that
was to offer to give em any of those little boxes of gold coin that
contained five thousand dollars ef they would kindly lift it from the
counter and take it away It wasnt no bigger than one of these chunks
but Jiminy you oughter have seed them gals grip and heave on it and
then hev to give it up You see they didnt know anything about the
pacihic the speshif He stopped with great dignity and added with
painful precision the specific gravity of gold

Dry up said Steptoe roughly Then turning to Stacy he said abruptly
But wheres the rest of it Youve got more than that

We sent it to Boomville this morning You see weve sold out our claim
to a company who take it up tomorrow and put up a mill and stamps
In fact its under their charge now Theyve got a gang of men on the
claim already

And what mout ye hev got for it if its a fair question said
Steptoe with a forced smile

Stacy smiled also I dont know that its a business question he
said

Five hundred thousand dollars said Demorest abruptly from the
doorway and a treble interest

The eyes of the two men met There was no mistaking the dull fire of
envy in Steptoes glance but Demorest received it with a certain cold
curiosity and turned away as the sound of arriving voices came from
without

Five hundred thousands a big figger said Steptoe with a coarse
laugh and I dont wonder it makes you feel so dd sassy But it WAS
a fair question

Unfortunately it here occurred to the whiskeystimulated brain of Dick
that the friend he had introduced was being treated with scant courtesy
and he forgot his own treatment by Steptoe Leaning against the wall he
waved a dignified rebuke Im sashified my ole frien is akshuated by
only businesh principles He paused recollected himself and added
with great precision When I say he himself has a valuable claim in
Red Gulch and to my shertain knowledge has received offersI have said
enough

The laugh that broke from Stacy and Barker to whom the infelicitous
reputation of Red Gulch was notorious did not allay Steptoes
irritation He darted a vindictive glance at the unfortunate Dick but
joined in the laugh And what was ye goin to do with that he said
pointing to the treasure

Oh were taking that with us Theres a chunk for each of us as a
memento We cast lots for the choice and Demorest wonthat one which
you couldnt lift with one hand you know said Stacy

Oh couldnt I I reckon you aint goin to give me the same chance
that they did at the Mint eh

Although the remark was accompanied with his usual coarse familiar
laugh there was a look in his eye so inconsequent in its significance
that Stacy would have made some reply but at this moment Demorest
reentered the cabin ushering in a half dozen miners from the Bar
below They were although youngish men some of the older locators in
the vicinity yet through years of seclusion and uneventful labors
they had acquired a certain childish simplicity of thought and manner
that was alternately amusing and pathetic They had never intruded upon
the reserve of the three partners of Heavy Tree Hill before nothing but
an infantine curiosity a shy recognition of the partners courtesy in
inviting them with the whole population of Heavy Tree to the dinner the
next day and the nevertoberesisted temptation of an evening of free
liquor and forgetfulness of the past had brought them there now
Among them and yet not of them was a young man who although speaking
English without accent was distinctly of a different nationality and
race This with a certain neatness of dress and artificial suavity
of address had gained him the nickname of the Count and Frenchy
although he was really of Flemish extraction He was the Union Ditch
Companys agent on the Bar by virtue of his knowledge of languages

Barker uttered an exclamation of pleasure when he saw him Himself the
incarnation of naturalness he had always secretly admired this young
foreigner with his lacquered smoothness although a vague consciousness
that neither Stacy nor Demorest shared his feelings had restricted their
acquaintance Nevertheless he was proud now to see the bow with which
Paul Van Loo entered the cabin as if it were a drawingroom and perhaps
did not reflect upon that want of real feeling in an act which made the
others uncomfortable

The slight awkwardness their entrance produced however was quickly
forgotten when the blanket was again lifted from the pan of treasure
Singularly enough too the same feverish light came into the eyes of
each as they all gathered around this yellow shrine Even the polite
Paul rudely elbowed his way between the others though his artificial
Pardon seemed to Barker to condone this act of brutal instinct But it
was more instructive to observe the manner in which the older locators
received this confirmation of the fickle Fortune that had overlooked
their weary labors and years of waiting to lavish her favors on the new
and inexperienced amateurs Yet as they turned their dazzled eyes upon
the three partners there was no envy or malice in their depths no
reproach on their lips no insincerity in their wondering satisfaction
Rather there was a touching almost childlike resumption of hope as they
gazed at this conclusive evidence of Natures bounty The gold had been
thereTHEY had only missed it And if there more could be found Was
it not a proof of the richness of Heavy Tree Hill So strongly was this
reflected on their faces that a casual observer contrasting them with
the thoughtful countenances of the real owners would have thought them
the lucky ones It touched Barkers quick sympathies it puzzled Stacy
it made Demorest more serious it aroused Steptoes active contempt
Whiskey Dick alone remained stolid and impassive in a desperate attempt
to pull himself once more together Eventually he succeeded even to the
ambitious achievement of mounting a chair and lifting his tin cup with a
dangerously unsteady hand which did not however affect his precision
of utterance and said

Order gentlemen Well drink success toto

The next strike said Barker leaping impetuously on another chair
and beaming upon the old locatorsand may it come to those who have so
long deserved it

His sincere and generous enthusiasm seemed to break the spell of silence
that had fallen upon them Other toasts quickly followed In the general
good feeling Barker attached himself to Van Loo with his usual boyish
effusion and in a burst of confidence imparted the secret of his
engagement to Kitty Carter Van Loo listened with polite attention
formal congratulations but inscrutable eyes that occasionally wandered
to Stacy and again to the treasure A slight chill of disappointment
came over Barkers quick sensitiveness Perhaps his enthusiasm had bored
this superior man of the world Perhaps his confidences were in bad
taste With a new sense of his inexperience he turned sadly away Van
Loo took that opportunity to approach Stacy

Whats all this I hear of Barker being engaged to Miss Carter he
said with a faintly superior smile Is it really true

Yes Why shouldnt it be returned Stacy bluntly

Van Loo was instantly deprecating and smiling Why not of course But
isnt it sudden

They have known each other ever since hes been on Heavy Tree Hill
responded Stacy

Ah yes True said Van Loo But now

Wellhes got money enough to marry and hes going to marry

Rather young isnt he said Van Loo still deprecatingly And
shes got nothing Used to wait on the table at her fathers hotel in
Boomville didnt she

Yes What of that We all know it

Of course Its an excellent thing for herand her father Hell have
a rich soninlaw About two hundred thousand is his share isnt it I
suppose old Carter is delighted

Stacy had thought this before but did not care to have it corroborated
by this superfine young foreigner And I dont reckon that Barker is
offended if he is he said curtly as he turned away Nevertheless he
felt irritated that one of the three superior partners of Heavy Tree
Hill should be thought a dupe

Suddenly the conversation dropped the laughter ceased Every one turned
round and by a common instinct looked towards the door From
the obscurity of the hill slope below came a wonderful tenor voice
modulated by distance and spiritualized by the darkness

 When at some future day
 I shall be far away
 Thou wilt be weeping
 Thy lone watch keeping

The men looked at one another Thats Jack Hamlin they said Whats
he doing here

The wolves are gathering around fresh meat said Steptoe with his
coarse laugh and a glance at the treasure Didnt ye know he came over
from Red Dog yesterday

Well give Jack a fair show and his own game said one of the old
locators and hed clean out that pile afore sunrise

And lose it next day added another

But never turn a hair or change a muscle in either case said a third
Lord Ive heard him sing away just like that when hes been leaving
the board with five thousand dollars in his pocket or going away
stripped of his last red cent

Van Loo who had been listening with a peculiar smile here said in his
most deprecating manner Yes but did you never consider the influence
that such a man has on the hardworking tunnelmen who are ready to
gamble their whole weeks earnings to him Perhaps not But I know the
difficulties of getting the Ditch rates from these men when he has been
in camp

He glanced around him with some importance but only a laugh followed
his speech Come Frenchy said an old locator you only say that
because your little brother wanted to play with Jack like a grown
man and when Jack ordered him off the board and he became sassy Jack
scooted him outer the saloon

Van Loos face reddened with an anger that had the apparent effect of
removing every trace of his former polished repose and leaving only a
hard outline beneath At which Demorest interfered

I cant say that I see much difference in gambling by putting money
into a hole in the ground and expecting to take more from it than by
putting it on a card for the same purpose

Here the ravishing tenor voice which had been approaching ceased and
was succeeded by a heartbreaking and equally melodious whistling to
finish the bar of the singers song And the next moment Jack Hamlin
appeared in the doorway

Whatever was his present financial condition in perfect selfpossession
and charming sangfroid he fully bore out his previous description He
was as clean and refreshing looking as a madronotree in the dustblown
forest An odor of scented soap and freshly ironed linen was wafted from
him there was scarcely a crease in his white waistcoat nor a speck
upon his varnished shoes He might have been an auditor of the previous
conversation so quickly and completely did he seem to take in the
whole situation at a glance Perhaps there was an extra tilt to his
blackribboned Panama hat and a certain dancing devilry in his brown
eyeswhich might also have been an answer to adverse criticism

When I his truth to prove would trifle with my love he warbled
in general continuance from the doorway Then dropping cheerfully into
speech he added Well boys I am here to welcome the little stranger
and to trust that the family are doing as well as can be expected Ah
there it is Bless it he went on walking leisurely to the treasure
Triplets tooand plump at that Have you had em weighed

Frankness was an essential quality of Heavy Tree Hill We were just
saying Jack said an old locator that giving you a fair show
and your own game you could manage to get away with that pile before
daybreak

And Im just thinking said Jack cheerfully that there were some of
you here that could do that without any such useless preliminary His
brown eyes rested for a moment on Steptoe but turning quite abruptly
to Van Loo he held out his hand Startled and embarrassed before the
others the young man at last advanced his when Jack coolly put his
own as if forgetfully in his pocket I thought you might like to know
what that little brother of yours is doing he said to Van Loo yet
looking at Steptoe I found him wandering about the Hill here quite
drunk

I have repeatedly warned himbegan Van Loo reddening

Against bad companyI know suggested Jack gayly yet in spite of
all that I think he owes some of his liquor to Steptoe yonder

I never supposed the fool would get drunk over a glass of whiskey
offered in fun said Steptoe harshly yet evidently quite as much
disconcerted as angry

The trouble with Steptoe said Hamlin thoughtfully spanning his slim
waist with both hands as he looked down at his polished shoes is that
he has such a softhearted liking for all weaknesses Always wanting
to protect chaps that cant look after themselves whether its Whiskey
Dick there when he has a pull on or some nigger when hes made a little
strike or that straying lamb of Van Loos when hes puppy drunk But
youre wrong about me boys You cant draw me in any game tonight
This is one of my nights off which I devote exclusively to
contemplation and song But he added suddenly turning to his three
hosts with a bewildering and fascinating change of expression I
couldnt resist coming up here to see you and your pile even if I never
saw the one or the other before and am not likely to see either again
I believe in luck And it comes a mighty sight oftener than a fellow
thinks it does But it doesnt come to stay So Id advise you to keep
your eyes skinned and hang on to it while its with you like grim
death So long

Resisting all attempts of his hostswho had apparently fallen as
suddenly and unaccountably under the magic of his mannerto detain him
longer he stepped lightly away his voice presently rising again in
melody as he descended the hill Nor was it at all remarkable that the
others apparently drawn by the same inevitable magnetism were impelled
to follow him naturally joining their voices with his leaving Steptoe
and Van Loo so markedly behind them alone that they were compelled at
last in sheer embarrassment to close up the rear of the procession In
another moment the cabin and the three partners again relapsed into the
peace and quiet of the night With the dying away of the last voices on
the hillside the old solitude reasserted itself

But since the irruption of the strangers they had lost their former
sluggish contemplation and now busied themselves in preparation for
their early departure from the cabin the next morning They had arranged
to spend the following day and night at Boomville and Carters Hotel
where they were to give their farewell dinner to Heavy Tree Hill
They talked but little together since the rebuff his enthusiastic
confidences had received from Van Loo Barker had been grave and
thoughtful and Stacy with the irritating recollection of Van Loos
criticisms in his mind had refrained from his usual rallying of Barker
Oddly enough they spoke chiefly of Jack Hamlintill then personally
a stranger to them on account of his infelix reputationand even the
critical Demorest expressed a wish they had known him before But you
never know the real value of anything until youre quitting it or its
quitting you he added sententiously

Barker and Stacy both stared at their companion It was unlike Demorest
to regret anythingparticularly a mere social diversion

They say remarked Stacy that if you had known Jack Hamlin earlier
and professionally a great deal of real value would have quitted you
before he did

Dont repeat that rot flung out by men who have played Jacks game and
lost returned Demorest derisively Id rather trust him thanHe
stopped glanced at the meditative Barker and then concluded abruptly
the whole caboodle of his critics

They were silent for a few moments and then seemed to have fallen into
their former dreamy mood as they relapsed into their old seats again
At last Stacy drew a long breath I wish we had sent those nuggets off
with the others this morning

Why said Demorest suddenly

Why Well dn it all they kind of oppress me dont you see I seem
to feel em here on my chestall the three returned Stacy only half
jocularly Its their dd specific gravity I suppose I dont like
the idea of sleeping in the same room with em Theyre altogether too
much for us three men to be left alone with

You dont mean that you think that anybody would attemptsaid
Demorest

Stacy curled a fighting lip rather superciliously No I dont think
THATI rather wish I did Its the blessed chunks of solid gold that
seem to have got US fast dont you know and are going to stick to us
for good or ill A sort of Frankenstein monster that weve picked out of
a hole from below

I know just what Stacy means said Barker breathlessly rounding
his gray eyes Ive felt it too Couldnt we make a sort of cache of
itbury it just outside the cabin for tonight It would be sort of
putting it back into its old place you know for the time being IT
might like it

The other two laughed Rather rough on Providence Barker boy said
Stacy handing back the Heavensent gift so soon Besides whats to
keep any prospector from coming along and making a strike of it You
know thats mining lawif you havent preempted the spot as a claim

But Barker was too staggered by this material statement to make any
reply and Demorest arose And I feel that youd both better be turning
in as weve got to get up early He went to the corner of the cabin
and threw the blanket back over the pan and its treasure There
thatll keep the chunks from getting up to ride astride of you like a
nightmare He shut the door and gave a momentary glance at its cheap
hinges and the absence of bolt or bar Stacy caught his eye Well miss
this security in San Franciscoperhaps even in Boomville he sighed

It was scarcely ten oclock but Stacy and Barker had begun to undress
themselves with intervals of yawning and desultory talk Barker
continuing an amusing story with one stocking off and his trousers
hanging on his arm until at last both men were snugly curled up in
their respective bunks Presently Stacys voice came from under the
blankets

Hallo arent you going to turn in too

Not yet said Demorest from his chair before the fire You see its
the last night in the old shanty and I reckon Ill see the rest of it
out

Thats so said the impulsive Barker struggling violently with his
blankets I tell you what boys we just ought to make a watchnight of
ita regular vigil you knowuntil twelve at least Hold on Ill get
up too But here Demorest arose caught his youthful partners bare
foot which went searching painfully for the ground in one hand tucked
it back under the blankets and heaping them on the top of him patted
the bulk with an authoritative paternal air

Youll just say your prayers and go to sleep sonny Youll want to be
fresh as a daisy to appear before Miss Kitty tomorrow early and you
can keep your vigils for tomorrow night after dinner in the back
drawingroom I said Goodnight and I mean it

Protesting feebly Barker finally yielded in a nestling shiver and a
sudden silence Demorest walked back to his chair A prolonged snore
came from Stacys bunk then everything was quiet Demorest stirred up
the fire cast a huge root upon it and leaning back in his chair sat
with halfclosed eyes and dreamed

It was an old dream that for the past three years had come to him
daily sometimes even overtaking him under the shade of a buckeye in his
noontide rest on his claima dream that had never yet failed to wait
for him at night by the fireside when his partners were at rest a dream
of the past but so real that it always made the present seem the dream
through which he was moving towards some sure awakening

It was not strange that it should come to him tonight as it had often
come before slowly shaping itself out of the obscurity as the vision of
a fair young girl seated in one of the empty chairs before him Always
the same pretty childlike face fraught with a halffrightened
halfwondering trouble always the same slender graceful figure
but always glimmering in diamonds and satin or spiritual in lace and
pearls against his own rude and sordid surroundings always silent with
parted lips until the night wind smote some chord of recollection
and then mingled a remembered voice with his own For at those times
he seemed to speak also albeit with closed lips and an utterance
inaudible to all but her

Well he said sadly

Well the voice repeated like a gentle echo blending with his own

You know it all now he went on You know that it has come at
lastall that I had worked for prayed for all that would have made
us happy here all that would have saved you to me has come at last and
all too late

Too late echoed the voice with his

You remember he went on the last day we were together You remember
your friends and family would have you give me upa penniless man You
remember when they reproached you with my poverty and told you that it
was only your wealth that I was seeking that I then determined to
go away and never to return to claim you until that reproach could be
removed You remember dearest how you clung to me and bade me stay
with you even fly with you but not to leave you alone with them You
wore the same dress that day darling your eyes had the same wondering
childlike fear and trouble in them your jewels glittered on you as
you trembled and I refused In my pride or rather in my weakness and
cowardice I refused I came away and broke my heart among these rocks
and ledges yet grew strong and you my love YOU sheltered and
guarded by those you loved YOUHe stopped and buried his face in his
hands The night wind breathed down the chimney and from the stirred
ashes on the hearth came the soft whisper I died

And then he went on I cared for nothing Sometimes my heart awoke
for this young partner of mine in his innocent trustful love for a girl
that even in her humble station was far beyond his hopes and I pitied
myself in him Home fortune friends I no longer cared forall were
forgotten And now they are returning to meonly that I may see the
hollowness and vanity of them and taste the bitterness for which I
have sacrificed you And here on this last night of my exile I
am confronted with only the jealousy the doubt the meanness and
selfishness that is to come Too late Too late

The wondering troubled eyes that had looked into his here appeared to
clear and brighten with a sweet prescience Was it the wind moaning in
the chimney that seemed to whisper to him Too late beloved for ME
but not for you I died but Love still lives Be happy Philip And in
your happiness I too may live again

He started In the flickering firelight the chair was empty The wind
that had swept down the chimney had stirred the ashes with a sound like
the passage of a rustling skirt There was a chill in the air and a
smell like that of opened earth A nervous shiver passed over him Then
he sat upright There was no mistake it was no superstitious fancy
but a faint damp current of air was actually flowing across his feet
towards the fireplace He was about to rise when he stopped suddenly and
became motionless

He was actively conscious now of a strange sound which had affected him
even in the preoccupation of his vision It was a gentle brushing of
some yielding substance like that made by a soft broom on sand or the
sweep of a gown But to his mountain ears attuned to every woodland
sound it was not like the gnawing of gopher or squirrel the scratching
of wildcat nor the hairy rubbing of bear Nor was it human the long
deep respirations of his sleeping companions were distinct from that
monotonous sound He could not even tell if it were IN the cabin or
without Suddenly his eye fell upon the pile in the corner The blanket
that covered the treasure was actually moving

He rose quickly but silently alert selfcontained and menacing For
this dreamer this bereaved man this scornful philosopher of riches had
disappeared with that midnight trespass upon the sacred treasure The
movement of the blanket ceased the soft swishing sound recommenced He
drew a glittering bowieknife from his bootleg and in three noiseless
strides was beside the pile There he saw what he fully expected to
seea narrow horizontal gap between the log walls of the cabin and
the adobe floor slowly widening and deepening by the burrowing of
unseen hands from without The cold outer air which he had felt before
was now plainly flowing into the heated cabin through the opening The
swishing sound recommenced and stopped Then the four fingers of a
hand palm downwards were cautiously introduced between the bottom
log and the denuded floor Upon that intruding hand the bowieknife of
Demorest descended like a flash of lightning There was no outcry
Even in that supreme moment Demorest felt a pang of admiration for
the stoicism of the unseen trespasser But the maimed hand was quickly
withdrawn and as quickly Demorest rushed to the door and dashed into
the outer darkness

For an instant he was dazed and bewildered by the sudden change But the
next moment he saw a dodging doubling figure running before him and
threw himself upon it In the shock both men fell but even in that
contact Demorest felt the tangled beard and alcoholic fumes of Whiskey
Dick and felt also that the hands which were thrown up against his
breast the palms turned outward with the instinctive movement of a
timid defenseless man were unstained with soil or blood With an oath
he threw the drunkard from him and dashed to the rear of the cabin
But too late There indeed was the scattered earth there the widened
burrow as it had been excavated apparently by that mutilated handbut
nothing else

He turned back to Whiskey Dick But the miserable man although still
retaining a look of dazed terror in his eyes had recovered his feet
in a kind of angry confidence and a forced sense of injury What did
Demorest mean by attacking innoshent gentlemen on the trail outside
his cabin Yes OUTSIDE his cabin he would swear it

What were you doing here at midnight demanded Demorest

What was he doing What was any gentleman doing He wasnt any
mollycoddle to go to bed at ten oclock What was he doing Wellhed
been with men who didnt shut their doors and turn the boys out just
in the shank of the evening He wasnt any Barker to be wetnursed by
Demorest

Some one else was here said Demorest sternly with his eyes fixed on
Whiskey Dick The dull glaze which seemed to veil the outer world from
the drunkards pupils shifted suddenly with such a look of direct horror
that Demorest was fain to turn away his own But the veil mercifully
returned and with it Dicks workedup sense of injury Nobody was
therenot a shole Did Demorest think if there had been any of
his friends there they would have stood by like dogsh and seen him
insulted

Demorest turned away and reentered the cabin as Dick lurched heavily
forward still muttering down the trail The excitement over a
sickening repugnance to the whole incident took the place of Demorests
resentment and indignation There had been a cowardly attempt to rob
them of their miserable treasure He had met it and frustrated it in
almost as brutal a fashion the gold was already tarnished with blood
To his surprise yet relief he found his partners unconscious of the
outrage still sleeping with the physical immobility of overexcited
and tired men Should he awaken them No He should have to awaken
also their suspicions and desire for revenge There was no danger of
a further attack there was no fear that the culprit would disclose
himself and tomorrow they would be far away Let oblivion rest upon
that nights stain on the honor of Heavy Tree Hill

He rolled a small barrel before the opening smoothed the dislodged
earth replaced the pan with its treasure and trusted that in the
bustle of the early morning departure his partners might not notice any
change Stopping before the bunk of Stacy he glanced at the sleeping
man He was lying on his back but breathing heavily and his hands were
moving towards his chest as if indeed his strange fancy of the golden
incubus were being realized Demorest would have wakened him but
presently with a sigh of relief the sleeper turned over on his side
It was pleasanter to look at Barker whose damp curls were matted over
his smooth boyish forehead and whose lips were parted in a smile under
the silken wings of his brown mustache He too seemed to be trying to
speak and remembering some previous revelations which had amused them
Demorest leaned over him fraternally with an answering smile waiting
for the beloved ones name to pass the young mans lips But he only
murmured Threehundredthousand dollars The elder man turned away
with a grave face The influence of the treasure was paramount

When he had placed one of the chairs against the unprotected door at
an angle which would prevent any easy or noiseless intrusion Demorest
threw himself on his bunk without undressing and turned his face
towards the single window of the cabin that looked towards the east He
did not apprehend another covert attempt against the gold He did not
fear a robbery with force and arms although he was satisfied that there
was more than one concerned in it but this he attributed only to the
encumbering weight of their expected booty He simply waited for the
dawn It was some time before his eyes were greeted with the vague
opaline brightness of the firmament which meant the vanishing of the
pallid snowline before the coming day A bird twittered on the roof
The air was chill he drew his blanket around him Then he closed his
eyes he fancied only for a moment but when he opened them the door
was standing open in the strong daylight He sprang to his feet but
the next moment he saw it was only Stacy who had passed out and was
returning fully dressed bringing water from the spring to fill the
kettle But Stacys face was so grave that recalling his disturbed
sleep Demorest laughingly inquired if he had been haunted by the
treasure But to his surprise Stacy put down the kettle and with a
hurried glance at the still sleeping Barker said in a low voice

I want you to do something for me without asking why Later I will tell
you

Demorest looked at him fixedly What is it he said

The packmules will be here in a few moments Dont wait to close up or
put away anything here but clap that gold in the saddlebags and take
Barker with you and lite out for Boomville AT ONCE I will overtake
you later

Is there no time to discuss this asked Demorest

No said Stacy bluntly Call me a crank say Im in a blue funkhis
compressed lips and sharp black eyes did not lend themselves much to
that hypothesisonly get out of this with that stuff and take Barker
with you Im not responsible for myself while its here

Demorest knew Stacy to be combative but practical If he had not been
assured of his partners last night slumbers he might have thought he
knew of the attempt Or if he had discovered the turnedup ground in
the rear of the cabin his curiosity would have demanded an explanation
Demorest paused only for a moment and said Very well I will go

Good Ill rouse out Barker but not a word to himexcept that he must
go

The rousing out of Barker consisted of Stacys lifting that young
gentleman bodily from his bunk and standing him upright in the open
doorway But Barker was accustomed to this Spartan process and after a
moments balancing with closed lids like an unwrapped mummy he sat
down in the doorway and began to dress He at first demurred to their
departure except all togetherit was so unfraternal but eventually
he allowed himself to be persuaded out of it and into his clothes For
Barker had also had HIS visions in the night one of which was that they
should build a beautiful villa on the site of the old cabin and solemnly
agree to come every year and pass a week in it together I thought at
first he said sliding along the floor in search of different articles
of his dress or stopping gravely to catch them as they were thrown to
him by his partners that wed have it at Boomville as being handier
to get there but Ive concluded wed better have it here a little
higher up the hill where it could be seen over the whole Black Spur
Range When we werent here we could use it as a Hut of Refuge for
brokendown or washedout miners or weary travelers like those hospices
in the Alps you know and have somebody to keep it for us You see Ive
thought even of THAT and Van Loo is the very man to take charge of it
for us You see hes got such good manners and speaks two languages
Lord if a German or Frenchman came along poor and distressed Van Loo
would just chip in his own language See Youve got to think of all
these details you see boys And we might call it The Rest of the
Three Partners or Three Partners Rest

And you might begin by giving us one said Stacy Dry up and drink
your coffee

Ill draw out the plans Ive got it all in my head continued the
enthusiastic Barker unheeding the interruption Ill just run out and
take a look at the site its only right back of the cabin But here
Stacy caught him by his dangling belt as he was flying out of the door
with one boot on and thrust him down in a chair with a tin cup of
coffee in his hand

Keep the plans in your head Barker boy said Demorest for here
are the pack mules and packer This was quite enough to divert the
impressionable young man who speedily finished his dressing as a mule
bearing a large packsaddle and two enormous saddlebags or pouches
drove up before the door led by a muleteer on a small horse The
transfer of the treasure to the saddlebags was quickly made by their
united efforts as the first rays of the sun were beginning to paint
the hillside Shading his keen eyes with his hand Stacy stood in the
doorway and handed Demorest the two rifles Demorest hesitated Hadnt
YOU better keep one he said looking in his partners eyes with his
first challenge of curiosity The sun seemed to put a humorous twinkle
into Stacys glance as he returned Not much And youd better take
my revolver with you too Im feeling a little better now he said
looking at the saddlebags but Im not fit to be trusted yet with
carnal weapons When the other mule comes and is packed Ill overtake
you on the horse

A little more satisfied although still wondering and perplexed
Demorest shouldered one rifle and with Barker who was carrying the
other followed the muleteer and his equipage down the trail For a
while he was a little ashamed of his part in this unusual spectacle of
two armed men convoying a laden mule in broad daylight but luckily
it was too early for the Bar miners to be going to work and as the
tunnelmen were now at breakfast the trail was free of wayfarers At the
point where it crossed the main road Demorest however saw Steptoe
and Whiskey Dick emerge from the thicket apparently in earnest
conversation Demorest felt his repugnance and halfrestrained
suspicions suddenly return Yet he did not wish to betray them before
Barker nor was he willing in case of an emergency to allow the young
man to be entirely unprepared Calling him to follow he ran quickly
ahead of the laden mule and was relieved to find that looking
back his companion had brought his rifle to a ready through some
instinctive feeling of defense As Steptoe and Whiskey Dick a moment
later discovering them were evidently surprised there seemed however
to be no reason for fearing an outbreak Suddenly at a whisper from
Steptoe he and Whiskey Dick both threw up their hands and stood
still on the trail a few yards from them in a burlesque of the usual
recognized attitude of helplessness while a hoarse laugh broke from
Steptoe

Dd if we didnt think you were roadagents But we see youre only
guarding your treasure Rather fancy style for Heavy Tree Hill aint
it Things must be gettin rough up thar to hev to take out your guns
like that

Demorest had looked keenly at the four hands thus exhibited and was
more concerned that they bore no trace of wounds or mutilation than at
the insult of the speech particularly as he had a distinct impression
that the action was intended to show him the futility of his suspicions

I am glad to see that if you havent any arms in your hands youre not
incapable of handling them said Demorest coolly as he passed by them
and again fell into the rear of the muleteer

But Barker had thought the incident very funny and laughed effusively
at Whiskey Dick I didnt know that Steptoe was up to that kind of
fun he said and I suppose we DID look rather rough with these guns
as we ran on ahead of the mule But then you know that when you called
to me I really thought you were in for a shindy All the same Whiskey
Dick did that hands up to perfection how he managed it I dont know
but his knees seemed to knock together as if he was in a real funk

Demorest had thought so too but he made no reply How far that
miserable drunkard was a forced or willing accomplice of the events
of last night was part of a question that had become more and more
repugnant to him as he was leaving the scene of it forever It had
come upon him desecrating the dream he had dreamt that last night and
turning its hopeful climax to bitterness Small wonder that Barker
walking by his side had his quick sympathies aroused and as he saw
that shadow which they were all familiar with but had never sought to
penetrate fall upon his companions handsome face even his youthful
spirits yielded to it They were both relieved when the clatter of
hoofs behind them as they reached the valley announced the approach of
Stacy I started with the second mule and the last load soon after you
left he explained and have just passed them I thought it better
to join you and let the other load follow Nobody will interfere with
THAT

Then you are satisfied said Demorest regarding him steadfastly

You bet Look

He turned in his saddle and pointed to the crest of the hill they had
just descended Above the pines circling the lower slope above the bare
ledges of rock and outcrop a column of thick black smoke was rising
straight as a spire in the windless air

Thats the old shanty passing away said Stacy complacently I reckon
there wont be much left of it before we get to Boomville

Demorest and Barker stared You fired it said Barker trembling with
excitement

Yes said Stacy I couldnt bear to leave the old rookery for coyotes
and wildcats to gather in so I touched her off before I left

Butsaid Barker

But repeated Stacy composedly Hallo whats the matter with that
new plan of The Rest that youre going to build eh You dont want
them BOTH

And you did this rather than leave the dear old cabin to strangers
said Barker with kindling eyes Stacy I didnt think you had that
poetry in you

Theres heaps in me Barker boy that you dont know and I dont
exactly sabe myself

Only continued the young fellow eagerly we ought to have ALL been
there We ought to have made a solemn rite of it you knowa kind of
sacrifice We ought to have poured a kind of libation on the ground

I did sprinkle a little kerosene over it I think returned Stacy
just to help things along But if you want to see her flaming Barker
you just run back to that last corner on the road beyond the big red
wood Thats the spot for a view

As Barkeralways devoted to a spectacleswiftly disappeared the two
men faced each other Well what does it all mean said Demorest
gravely

It means old man said Stacy suddenly that if we hadnt had nigger
luck the same blind luck that sent us that strike you and I and that
Barker over there would have been swirling in that smoke up to the
sky about two hours ago He stopped and added in a lower but earnest
voice Look here Phil When I went out to fetch water this morning I
smelt something queer I went round to the back of the cabin and found
a hole dug under the floor and piled against the corner wall a lot of
brushwood and a can of kerosene Some of the kerosene had been already
poured on the brush Everything was ready to light and only my coming
out an hour earlier had frightened the devils away The idea was to set
the place on fire suffocate us in the smoke of the kerosene poured into
the hole and then to rush in and grab the treasure It was a systematic
plan

No said Demorest quietly

No repeated Stacy I told you I saw the whole thing and took away
the kerosene which I hid and after you had gone used it to fire the
cabin with to see if the ones I suspected would gather to watch their
work

It was no part of their FIRST plan said Demorest which was only
robbery Listen He hurriedly recounted his experience of the preceding
night to the astonished Stacy No the fire was an afterthought and
revenge he added sternly

But you say you cut the robber in the hand there would be no
difficulty in identifying him by that

I wounded only a HAND said Demorest But there was a HEAD in that
attempt that I never saw He then revealed his own halfsuspicions but
how they were apparently refuted by the bravado of Steptoe and Whiskey
Dick

Then that was the reason THEY didnt gather at the fire said Stacy
quickly

Ah said Demorest then YOU too suspected them

Stacy hesitated and then said abruptly Yes

Demorest was silent for a moment

Why didnt you tell me this this morning he said gently

Stacy pointed to the distant Barker I didnt want you to tell him I
thought it better for one partner to keep a secret from two than for the
two to keep it from one Why didnt you tell me of your experience last
night

I am afraid it was for the same reason said Demorest with a faint
smile And it sometimes seems to me Jim that we ought to imitate
Barkers frankness In our dread of tainting him with our own knowledge
of evil we are sending him out into the world very poorly equipped for
all his three hundred thousand dollars

I reckon youre right said Stacy briefly extending his hand Shake
on that

The two men grasped each others hands

And hes no fool either continued Demorest When we met Steptoe on
the road without a word from me he closed up alongside with his hand
on the lock of his rifle And I hadnt the heart to praise him or laugh
it off

Nevertheless they were both silent as the object of their criticism
bounded down the trail towards them He had seen the funeral pyre It
was awfully sad it was awfully lovely but there was something grand
in it Who could have thought Stacy could be so poetic But he wanted to
tell them something else that was mighty pretty

What was it said Demorest

Well said Barker dont laugh But you know that Jack Hamlin Well
boys hes been hovering around us on his mustang keeping us and that
packmule in sight ever since we left Sometimes hes on a side trail
off to the right sometimes off to the left but always at the same
distance I didnt like to tell you boys for I thought youd laugh
at me but I think you know hes taken a sort of shine to us since he
dropped in last night And I fancy you see hes sort of hanging round
to see that we get along all right Id have pointed him out before
only I reckoned you and Stacy would say he was making up to us for our
money

And wed have been wrong Barker boy said Stacy with a heartiness
that surprised Demorest for I reckon your instincts the right one

There he is now said the gratified Barker just abreast of us on the
cutoff He started just after we did and hes got a horse that could
have brought him into Boomville hours ago Its just his kindness

He pointed to a distant fringe of buckeye from which Jack Hamlin had
just emerged Although evidently holding in a powerful mustang nothing
could be more unconscious and utterly indifferent than his attitude He
did not seem to know of the proximity of any other traveler and to care
less His handsome head was slightly thrown back as if he was caroling
after his usual fashion but the distance was too great to make his
melody audible to them or to allow Barkers shout of invitation to
reach him Suddenly he lowered his tightened rein the mustang sprang
forward and with a flash of silver spurs and bridle fripperies he had
disappeared But as the trail he was pursuing crossed theirs a mile
beyond it seemed quite possible that they should again meet him

They were now fairly into the Boomville valley and were entering a
narrow arroyo bordered with dusky willows which effectually excluded the
view on either side It was the bed of a mountain torrent that in winter
descended the hillside over the trail by which they had just come but
was now sunk into the thirsty plain between banks that varied from
two to five feet in height The muleteer had advanced into the narrow
channel when he suddenly cast a hurried glance behind him uttered a
Madre de Dios and backed his mule and his precious freight against
the bank The sound of hoofs on the trail in their rear had caught his
quicker ear and as the three partners turned they beheld three horsemen
thundering down the hill towards them They were apparently Mexican
vaqueros of the usual common swarthy type their faces made still darker
by the black silk handkerchief tied round their heads under their stiff
sombreros Either they were unable or unwilling to restrain their horses
in their headlong speed and a collision in that narrow passage was
imminent but suddenly before reaching its entrance they diverged
with a volley of oaths and dashing along the left bank of the arroyo
disappeared in the intervening willows Divided between relief at their
escape and indignation at what seemed to be a drunken feastday freak
of these roystering vaqueros the little party reformed when a cry
from Barker arrested them He had just perceived a horseman motionless
in the arroyo who although unnoticed by them had evidently been seen
by the Mexicans He had apparently leaped into it from the bank and had
halted as if to witness this singular incident As the clatter of
the vaqueros hoofs died away he lightly leaped the bank again and
disappeared But in that single glimpse of him they recognized Jack
Hamlin When they reached the spot where he had halted they could see
that he must have approached it from the trail where they had previously
seen him but which they now found crossed it at right angles Barker
was right He had really kept them at easy distance the whole length of
the journey

But they were now reaching its end When they issued at last from
the arroyo they came upon the outskirts of Boomville and the great
stageroad Indeed the six horses of the Pioneer coach were just
panting along the last half mile of the steep upgrade as they
approached They halted mechanically as the heavy vehicle swayed
and creaked by them In their ordinary working dress sunburnt with
exposure covered with dust and carrying their rifles still in their
hands they perhaps presented a sufficiently characteristic appearance
to draw a few facessome of them pretty and intelligentto the windows
of the coach as it passed The sensitive Barker was quickest to feel
that resentment with which the Pioneer usually met the wideeyed
criticism of the Eastern tourist or greenhorn and reddened under the
bold scrutiny of a pair of black inquisitive eyes behind an eyeglass
That annoyance was communicated though in a lesser degree even to the
bearded Demorest and Stacy It was an unexpected contact with that great
world in which they were so soon to enter They felt ashamed of
their appearance and yet ashamed of that feeling They felt a secret
satisfaction when Barker said Theyd open their eyes wider if they
knew what was in that packsaddle and yet they corrected him for what
they were pleased to call his snobbishness They hurried a little
faster as the road became more frequented as if eager to shorten their
distance to clean clothes and civilization

Only Demorest began to linger in the rear This contact with the
stagecoach had again brought him face to face with his buried past He
felt his old dream revive and occasionally turned to look back upon
the dark outlines of Black Spur under whose shadow it had returned so
often and wondered if he had left it there forever and it were now
slowly exhaling with the thinned and dying smoke of their burning cabin

His companions knowing his silent moods had preceded him at some
distance when he heard the soft sound of ambling hoofs on the thick
dust and suddenly the light touch of Jack Hamlins gauntlet on his
shoulder The mustang Jack bestrode was reeking with grime and sweat
but Jack himself was as immaculate and fresh as ever With a delightful
affectation of embarrassment and timidity he began flicking the side
buttons of his velvet vaquero trousers with the thong of his riata
I reckoned to sling a word along with you before you went he said
looking down but Im so shy that I couldnt do it in company So I
thought Id get it off on you while you were alone

Weve seen you once or twice before this morning said Demorest
pleasantly and we were sorry you didnt join us

I reckon I might have said Jack gayly if my horse had only made up
his mind whether he was a bird or a squirrel and hadnt been so various
and promiscuous about whether he wanted to climb a tree or fly Hes
not a bad horse for a Mexican plug only when he thinks there is
any devilment around he wants to wade in and take a hand However I
reckoned to see the last of you and your pile into Boomville And I DID
When I meet three fellows like you that are clean white all through I
sort of cotton to em even if IM a little of a brunette myself And
Ive got something to give you

He took from a fold of his scarlet sash a small parcel neatly folded in
white paper as fresh and spotless as himself Holding it in his fingers
he went on I happened to be at Heavy Tree Hill early this morning
before sunup In the darkness I struck your cabin and I reckonI
struck somebody else At first I thought it was one of you chaps down on
your knees praying at the rear of the cabin but the way the fellow lit
out when he smelt me coming made me think it wasnt entirely fasting and
prayer However I went to the rear of the cabin and then I reckoned
some kind friend had been bringing you kindlings and firewood for your
early breakfast But that didnt satisfy me so I knelt down as he had
knelt and then I sawwell Mr Demorest I reckon I saw JUST WHAT YOU
HAVE SEEN But even then I wasnt quite satisfied for that man had been
grubbing round as if searching for something So I searched tooand I
found IT Ive got it here Im going to give it to you for it may some
day come in handy and you wont find anything like it among the folks
where youre going Its something unique as those fineartcollecting
sharps in Frisco saysomething quite matchless unless you try to
match it one day yourself Dont open the paper until I run on and say
So long to your partners Goodby

He grasped Demorests hand and then dropped the little packet into his
palm and ambled away towards Stacy and Barker Holding the packet in
his hand with an amused yet puzzled smile Demorest watched the gambler
give Stacys hand a hearty farewell shake and a supplementary slap on
the back to the delighted Barker and then vanish in a flash of red
sash and silver buttons At which Demorest walking slowly towards his
partners opened the packet and stood suddenly still It contained the
dried and bloodless second finger of a human hand cut off at the first
joint

For an instant he held it at arms length as if about to cast it away
Then he grimly replaced it in the paper put it carefully in his pocket
and silently walked after his companions




CHAPTER I


A strong southwester was beating against the windows and doors of
Stacys Bank in San Francisco and spreading a film of rain between the
regular splendors of its mahogany counters and sprucely dressed clerks
and the usual passing pedestrian For Stacys new bankinghouse had
long since received the epithet of palatial from an enthusiastic
local press fresh from the opening luncheon in its richly decorated
directors rooms and it was said that once a homely wouldbe depositor
from One Horse Gulch was so cowed by its magnificence that his heart
failed him at the last moment and mumbling an apology to the elegant
receiving teller fled with his greasy chamois pouch of golddust to
deposit his treasure in the dingy Mint around the corner Perhaps there
was something of this feeling mingled with a certain simpleminded
fascination in the hesitation of a stranger of a higher class who
entered the bank that rainy morning and finally tendered his card to the
important negro messenger

The card preceded him through noiselessly swinging doors and across
heavily carpeted passages until it reached the inner core of Mr James
Stacys private offices and was respectfully laid before him He was
not alone At his side in an attitude of polite and studied expectancy
stood a correctlooking young man for whom Mr Stacy was evidently
writing a memorandum The stranger glanced furtively at the card with a
curiosity hardly in keeping with his suggested good breeding but Stacy
did not look at it until he had finished his memorandum

There he said with business decision you can tell your people that
if we carry their new debentures over our limit we will expect a larger
margin Ditches are not what they were three years ago when miners were
willing to waste their money over your rates They dont gamble THAT WAY
any more and your company ought to know it and not gamble themselves
over that prospect He handed the paper to the stranger who bowed over
it with studied politeness and backed towards the door Stacy took up
the waiting card read it said to the messenger Show him in and
in the same breath turned to his guest I say Van Loo its George
Barker You know him

Yes said Van Loo with a polite hesitation as he halted at the door
He wasI thinkerin your employ at Heavy Tree Hill

Nonsense He was my partner And you must have known him since at
Boomville Come He got forty shares of Ditch stockthrough youat
110 which were worth about 80 SOMEBODY must have made money enough by
it to remember him

I was only speaking of him socially said Van Loo with a deprecating
smile You know he married a young womanthe hotelkeepers daughter
who used to wait at the tableand after my mother and sister came out
to keep house for me at Boomville it was quite impossible for me to see
much of him for he seldom went out without his wife you know

Yes said Stacy dryly I think you didnt like his marriage But Im
glad your disinclination to see him isnt on account of that deal in
stocks

Oh no said Van Loo Goodby

But unfortunately in the next passage he came upon Barker who with a
cry of unfeigned pleasure none the less sincere that he was feeling a
little alien in these impressive surroundings recognized him Nothing
could exceed Van Loos protest of delight at the meeting nothing
his equal desolation at the fact that he was hastening to another
engagement But your old partner he added with a smile is waiting
for you he has just received your card and I should be only keeping
you from him So glad to see you youre looking so well Goodby
Goodby

Reassured Barker no longer hesitated but dashed with his old
impetuousness into his former partners room Stacy already deeply
absorbed in other business was sitting with his back towards him and
Barkers arms were actually encircling his neck before the astonished
and halfangry man looked up But when his eyes met the laughing gray
ones of Barker above him he gently disengaged himself with a quick
return of the caress rose shut the door of an inner office and
returning pushed Barker into an armchair in quite the old suppressive
fashion of former days Yes it was the same Stacy that Barker looked
at albeit his brown beard was now closely cropped around his determined
mouth and jaw in a kind of grave decorum and his energetic limbs
already attuned to the rigor of clothes of fashionable cut and still
more rigorous sombreness of color

Barker boy he began with the familiar twinkle in his keen eyes which
the younger partner remembered I dont encourage stag dancing among my
young men during bank hours and youll please to remember that we are
not on Heavy Tree Hill

Where broke in Barker enthusiastically we were only overlooked by
the Black Spur Range and the Sierran snowline where the nearest voice
that came to you was quarter of a mile away as the crow flies and nearly
a mile by the trail

And was generally an oath said Stacy But youre in San Francisco
NOW Where are you stopping He took up a pencil and held it over a
memorandum pad awaitingly

At the Brook House Its

Hold on Brook House Stacy repeated as he jotted it down And for
how long

Oh a day or two You see Kitty

Stacy checked him with a movement of his pencil in the air and then
wrote down Day or two Wife with you

Yes and oh Stacy our boy Ah he went on with a laugh knocking
aside the remonstrating pencil you must listen Hes just the
sweetest knowingest little chap living Do you know what were going to
christen him Well hell be Stacy Demorest Barker Good names arent
they And then it perpetuates the dear old friendship

Stacy picked up the pencil again wrote Wife and child S D B and
leaned back in his chair Now Barker he said briefly Im coming
to dine with you tonight at 730 sharp THEN well talk Heavy Tree Hill
wife baby and S D B But here Im all for business Have you any
with me

Barker who was easily amused had extracted a certain entertainment out
of Stacys memorandum but he straightened himself with a look of eager
confidence and said Certainly thats just what it isbusiness Lord
Stacy Im ALL business now Im in everything And I bank with you
though perhaps you dont know it its in your Branch at Marysville I
didnt want to say anything about it to you before But Lord you
dont suppose that Id bank anywhere else while you are in the
businesschecks dividends and all that but in this matter I felt you
knew old chap I didnt want to talk to a banker nor to a bank but to
Jim Stacy my old partner

Barker said Stacy curtly how much money are you short of

At this direct question Barkers always quick color rose but with an
equally quick smile he said I dont know yet that Im short at all

But I do

Look here Jim why Im just overloaded with shares and stocks said
Barker smiling

Not one of which you could realize on without sacrifice Barker three
years ago you had three hundred thousand dollars put to your account at
San Francisco

Yes said Barker with a quiet reminiscent laugh I remember I wanted
to draw it out in one check to see how it would look

And youve drawn out all in three years and it looks dd bad

How did you know it asked Barker his face beaming only with
admiration of his companions omniscience

How did I know it retorted Stacy I know YOU and I know the kind of
people who have unloaded to you

Come Stacy said Barker Ive only invested in shares and stocks
like everybody else and then only on the best advice I could get
like Van Loos for instancethat man who was here just now the
new manager of the Empire Ditch Company and Carters my own Kittys
father And when I was offered fifty thousand Wide West Extensions
and was hesitating over it he told me YOU were in it tooand that was
enough for me to buy it

Yes but we didnt go into it at his figures

No said Barker with an eager smile but you SOLD at his figures
for I knew that when I found that YOU my old partner was in it dont
you see I preferred to buy it through your bank and did at 110 Of
course you wouldnt have sold it at that figure if it wasnt worth it
then and neither I nor you are to blame if it dropped the next week to
60 dont you see

Stacys eyes hardened for a moment as he looked keenly into his former
partners bright gray ones but there was no trace of irony in Barkers
On the contrary a slight shade of sadness came over them No he said
reflectively I dont think Ive ever been foolish or followed out my
OWN ideas except once and that was extravagant I admit That was
my idea of building a kind of refuge you know on the site of our old
cabin where poor miners and playedout prospectors waiting for a strike
could stay without paying anything Well I sunk twenty thousand
dollars in that and might have lost more only CarterKittys
fatherpersuaded mehes an awful clever old fellowinto turning it
into a kind of branch hotel of Boomville while using it as a hotel to
take poor chaps who couldnt pay at half prices or quarter prices
PRIVATELY dont you see so as to spare their prideawfully pretty
wasnt itand make the hotel profit by it

Well said Stacy as Barker paused

They didnt come said Barker

But he added eagerly it shows that things were better than I had
imagined Only the others did not come either

And you lost your twenty thousand dollars said Stacy curtly

FIFTY thousand said Barker for of course it had to be a larger
hotel than the other And I think that Carter wouldnt have gone into it
except to save me from losing money

And yet made you lose fifty thousand instead of twenty For I dont
suppose HE advanced anything

He gave his time and experience said Barker simply

I dont think it worth thirty thousand dollars said Stacy dryly But
all this doesnt tell me what your business is with me today

No said Barker brightening up but it is business you know
Something in the old styleas between partner and partnerand thats
why I came to YOU and not to the banker And it all comes out of
something that Demorest once told us so you see its all us three
again Well you know of course that the Excelsior Ditch Company have
abandoned the Bar and Heavy Tree Hill It didnt pay

Yes nor does the company pay any dividends now You ought to know
with fifty thousand of their stock on your hands

Barker laughed But listen I found that I could buy up their whole
plant and all the ditching along the Black Spur Range for ten thousand
dollars

And Great Scott you dont think of taking up their business said
Stacy aghast

Barker laughed more heartily No Not their business But I remember
that once Demorest told us in the dear old days that it cost nearly
as much to make a water ditch as a railroad in the way of surveying and
engineering and levels you know And heres the plant for a railroad
Dont you see

But a railroad from Black Spur to Heavy Tree Hillwhats the good of
that

Why Black Spur will be in the line of the new Divide Railroad theyre
trying to get a bill for in the legislature

An infamous piece of wildcat jobbing that will never pass said Stacy
decisively

They said BECAUSE it was that it would pass said Barker simply
They say that Watsons Bank is in it and is bound to get it through
And as that is a rival bank of yours dont you see I thought that if
WE could get something real good or valuable out of itsomething that
would do the Black Spur goodit would be all right

And was your business to consult me about it said Stacy bluntly

No said Barker its too late to consult you now though I wish I
had Ive given my word to take it and I cant back out But I havent
the ten thousand dollars and I came to you

Stacy slowly settled himself back in his chair and put both hands in
his pockets Not a cent Barker not a cent

Im not asking it of the BANK said Barker with a smile for I could
have gone to the bank for it But as this was something between us I am
asking you Stacy as my old partner

And I am answering you Barker as your old partner but also as the
partner of a hundred other men who have even a greater right to ask me
And my answer is not a cent

Barker looked at him with a pale astonished face and slightly parted
lips Stacy rose thrust his hands deeper in his pockets and standing
before him went on

Now look here Its time you should understand me and yourself Three
years ago when our partnership was dissolved by accident or mutual
consent we will say we started afresh each on our own hook Through
foolishness and bad advice you have in those three years hopelessly
involved yourself as you never would have done had we been partners and
yet in your difficulty you ask me and my new partners to help you out of
a difficulty in which they have no concern

Your NEW partners stammered Barker

Yes my new partners for every man who has a share or a deposit or
an interest or a dollar in this bank is my PARTNEReven you with your
securities at the Branch are one and you may say that in THIS I am
protecting you against yourself

But you have moneyyou have private means

None to speculate with as you wish me toon account of my position
none to give away foolishly as you expect me toon account of precedent
and example I am a soulless machine taking care of capital intrusted to
me and my brains but decidedly NOT to my heart nor my sentiment So my
answer is not a cent

Barkers face had changed his color had come back but with an older
expression Presently however his beaming smile returned with the
additional suggestion of an affectionate toleration which puzzled Stacy

I believe youre right old chap he said extending his hand to the
banker and I wish I had talked to you before But its too late now
and Ive given my word

Your WORD said Stacy Have you no written agreement

No My word was accepted He blushed slightly as if conscious of a
great weakness

But that isnt legal nor business And you couldnt even hold the Ditch
Company to it if THEY chose to back out

But I dont think they will said Barker simply And you see my word
wasnt given entirely to THEM I bought the thing through my wifes
cousin Henry Spring a broker and he makes something by it from the
company on commission And I cant go back on HIM What did you say

Stacy had only groaned through his set teeth Nothing he said
briefly except that Im coming as I said before to dine with you
tonight but no more BUSINESS Ive enough of that with others and
there are some waiting for me in the outer office now

Barker rose at once but with the same affectionate smile and tender
gravity of countenance and laid his hand caressingly on Stacys
shoulder Its like you to give up so much of your time to me and my
foolishness and be so frank with me And I know its mighty rough on
you to have to be a mere machine instead of Jim Stacy Dont you bother
about me Ill sell some of my Wide West Extension and pull the thing
through myself Its all right but Im sorry for you old chap He
glanced around the room at the walls and rich paneling and added I
suppose thats what you have to pay for all this sort of thing

Before Stacy could reply a waiting visitor was announced for the second
time and Barker with another handshake and a reassuring smile to his
old partner passed into the hall as if the onus of any infelicity in
the interview was upon himself alone But Stacy did not seem to be in a
particularly accessible mood to the new caller who in his turn appeared
to be slightly irritated by having been kept waiting over some irksome
business You dont seem to follow me he said to Stacy after reciting
his business perplexity Cant you suggest something

Well why dont you get hold of one of your board of directors
said Stacy abstractedly Theres Captain Drummond you and he are old
friends You were comrades in the Mexican War werent you

That be dd said his visitor bitterly All his interests are
the other way and in a trade of this kind you know Stacy that a man
would sacrifice his own brother Do you suppose that hed let up on a
sure thing that hes got just because he and I fought side by side at
Cerro Gordo Come what are you giving us Youre the last man I ever
expected to hear that kind of flapdoodle from If its because your bank
has got some other interest and you cant advise me why dont you say
so Nevertheless in spite of Stacys abrupt disclaimer he left a few
minutes later half convinced that Stacys lukewarmness was due to some
adverse influence Other callers were almost as quickly disposed of and
at the end of an hour Stacy found himself again alone

But not apparently in a very satisfied mood After a few moments of
purely mechanical memorandamaking he rose abruptly and opened a small
drawer in a cabinet from which he took a letter still in its envelope
It bore a foreign postmark Glancing over it hastily his eyes at
last became fixed on a concluding paragraph I hope wrote his
correspondent that even in the rush of your big business you will
sometimes look after Barker Not that I think the dear old chap will
ever go wrongindeed I often wish I was as certain of myself as of
him and his insight but I am afraid we were more inclined to be merely
amused and tolerant of his wonderful trust and simplicity than to really
understand it for his own good and ours I know you did not like his
marriage and were inclined to believe he was the victim of a rather
unscrupulous father and a foolish unequal girl but are you satisfied
that he would have been the happier without it or lived his perfect
life under other and what you may think wiser conditions If he WROTE
the poetry that he LIVES everybody would think him wonderful for being
what he is we never give him sufficient credit Stacy smiled grimly
and penciled on his memorandum He wants it to the amount of ten
thousand dollars Anyhow continued the writer look after him Jim
for his sake your sake and the sake ofPHIL DEMOREST

Stacy put the letter back in its envelope and tossing it grimly aside
went on with his calculations Presently he stopped restored the letter
to his cabinet and rang a bell on his table Send Mr North here
he said to the negro messenger In a few moments his chief bookkeeper
appeared in the doorway

Turn to the Branch ledger and bring me a statement of Mr George
Barkers account

He was here a moment ago said North essaying a confidential look
towards his chief

I know it said Stacy coolly without looking up

Hes been running a good deal on wildcat lately suggested North

I asked for his account and not your opinion of it said Stacy
shortly

The subordinate withdrew somewhat abashed but still curious and
returned presently with a ledger which he laid before his chief Stacy
ran his eyes over the list of Barkers securities it seemed to him that
all the wildest schemes of the past year stared him in the face His
finger however stopped on the Wide West Extension Mr Barker will be
wanting to sell some of this stock What is it quoted at now

Sixty

But I would prefer that Mr Barker should not offer in the open market
at present Give him seventy for itprivate sale that will be ten
thousand dollars paid to his credit Advise the Branch of this at once
and to keep the transaction quiet

Yes sir responded the clerk as he moved towards the door But he
hesitated and with another essay at confidence said insinuatingly I
always thought sir that Wide West would recover

Stacy perhaps not displeased to find what had evidently passed in his
subordinates mind looked at him and said dryly Then I would advise
you also to keep that opinion to yourself But clever as he was he
had not anticipated the result Mr North though a trusted employee
was human On arriving in the outer office he beckoned to one of the
lounging brokers and in a low voice said Ill take two shares of Wide
West if you can get it cheap

The brokers face became alert and eager Yes but I say is anything
up

Im not here to give the business of the bank away retorted North
severely take the order or leave it

The man hurried away Having thus vindicated his humanity by also
passing the snub he had received from Stacy to an inferior he turned
away to carry out his masters instructions yet secure in the belief
that he had profited by his superior discernment of the real reason
of that masters singular conduct But when he returned to the private
room in hopes of further revelations Mr Stacy was closeted with
another financial magnate and had apparently divested his mind of the
whole affair




CHAPTER II


When George Barker returned to the outer ward of the financial
stronghold he had penetrated with its curving sweep of counters brass
railings and wirework screens defended by the spruce clerks behind
them he was again impressed with the position of the man he had just
quitted and for a moment hesitated with an inclination to go back
It was with no idea of making a further appeal to his old comrade
butwhat would have been odd in any other nature but hishe was
affected by a sense that HE might have been unfair and selfish in his
manner to the man panoplied by these defenses and who was in a measure
forced to be a part of them He would like to have returned and condoled
with him The clerks who were heartlessly familiar with the anxious
bearing of the men who sought interviews with their chief both before
and after smiled with the whispered conviction that the fresh and
ingenuous young stranger had been chucked like others until they
met his kindly tolerant and even superior eyes and were puzzled
Meanwhile Barker who had that sublime natural quality of abstraction
over small impertinences which is more exasperating than studied
indifference after his brief hesitation passed out unconcernedly
through the swinging mahogany doors into the blowy street Here the wind
and rain revived him the bank and its curt refusal were forgotten he
walked onward with only a smiling memory of his partner as in the old
days He remembered how Stacy had burned down their old cabin rather
than have it fall into sordid or unworthy handsthis Stacy who was now
condemned to sink his impulses and become a mere machine He had never
known Stacys real motive for that actboth Demorest and Stacy
had kept their knowledge of the attempted robbery from their younger
partnerit always seemed to him to be a precious revelation of Stacys
inner nature Facing the wind and rain he recalled how Stacy though
never so enthusiastic about his marriage as Demorest had taken up Van
Loo sharply for some foolish sneer about his own youthfulness He was
affectionately tolerant of even Stacys dislike to his wifes relations
for Stacy did not know them as he did Indeed Barker whose own father
and mother had died in his infancy had accepted his wifes relations
with a loving trust and confidence that was supreme from the fact that
he had never known any other

At last he reached his hotel It was a new one the latest creation of a
feverish progress in hotelbuilding which had covered five years and as
many squares with large showy erections utterly beyond the needs of the
community yet each superior in size and adornment to its predecessor
It struck him as being the one evidence of an abiding faith in the
future of the metropolis that he had seen in nothing else As he entered
its frescoed hall that afternoon he was suddenly reminded by its
challenging opulency of the bank he had just quitted without knowing
that the bank had really furnished its capital and its original design
The gilded barrooms flashing with mirrors and cut glass the saloons
with their desert expanse of Turkey carpet and oasis of clustered divans
and gilded tables the great diningroom with porphyry columns and
walls and ceilings shining with allegoryall these things which had
attracted his youthful wonder without distracting his correct simplicity
of taste he now began to comprehend It was the banks money at work
In the clatter of dishes in the diningroom he even seemed to hear again
the chinking of coin

It was a short cut to his apartments to pass through a smaller public
sittingroom popularly known as Flirtation Camp where eight or ten
couples generally found refuge on chairs and settees by the windows
half concealed by heavy curtains But the occupants were by no means
youthful spinsters or bachelors they were generally married women
guests of the hotel receiving other peoples husbands whose wives were
in the States or responsible middleaged leaders of the town In
the elaborate toilettes of the women as compared with the less formal
business suits of the men there was an odd mingling of the social
attitude with perhaps more mysterious confidences The idle gossip about
them had never affected Barker rather he had that innate respect for
the secrets of others which is as inseparable from simplicity as it is
from high breeding and he scarcely glanced at the different couples in
his progress through the room He did not even notice a rather striking
and handsome woman who surrounded by two or three admirers yet looked
up at Barker as he passed with selfconscious lids as if seeking a
return of her glance But he moved on abstractedly and only stopped
when he suddenly saw the familiar skirt of his wife at a further window
and halted before it

Oh its YOU said Mrs Barker with a halfnervous halfimpatient
laugh Why I thought youd certainly stay half the afternoon with your
old partner considering that you havent met for three years

There was no doubt she HAD thought so there was equally no doubt that
the conversation she was carrying on with her companiona goodlooking
portly business manwas effectually interrupted But Barker did not
notice it Captain Heath my husband she went on carelessly rising
and smoothing her skirts The captain who had risen too bowed vaguely
at the introduction but Barker extended his hand frankly I found
Stacy busy he said in answer to his wife but he is coming to dine
with us tonight

If you mean Jim Stacy the banker said Captain Heath brightening
into greater ease hes the busiest man in California Ive seen
men standing in a queue outside his door as in the old days at the
postoffice And he only gives you five minutes and no extension So
you and he were partners once he said looking curiously at the still
youthful Barker

But it was Mrs Barker who answered Oh yes and always such good
friends I was awfully jealous of him Nevertheless she did not
respond to the affectionate protest in Barkers eyes nor to the laugh of
Captain Heath but glanced indifferently around the room as if to
leave further conversation to the two men It was possible that she was
beginning to feel that Captain Heath was as de trop now as her husband
had been a moment before Standing there however between them both
idly tracing a pattern on the carpet with the toe of her slipper she
looked prettier than she had ever looked as Kitty Carter Her slight
figure was more fully developed That artificial severity covering
a natural virgin coyness with which she used to wait at table in her
fathers hotel at Boomville had gone and was replaced by a satisfied
consciousness of her power to please Her glance was freer but not
as frank as in those days Her dress was undoubtedly richer and more
stylish yet Barkers loyal heart often reverted fondly to the chintz
gown coquettishly frilled apron and spotless cuffs and collar in which
she had handed him his coffee with a faint color that left his own face
crimson

Captain Heaths tact being equal to her indifference he had excused
himself although he was becoming interested in this youthful husband
But Mrs Barker after having asserted her husbands distinction as
the equal friend of the millionaire was by no means willing that the
captain should be further interested in Barker for himself alone and
did not urge him to stay As he departed she turned to her husband and
indicating the group he had passed the moment before said

That horrid woman has been staring at us all the time I dont see what
you see in her to admire

Poor Barkers admiration had been limited to a few words of civility in
the enforced contact of that huge caravansary and in his quiet youthful
recognition of her striking personality But he was just then too
preoccupied with his interview with Stacy to reply and perhaps he did
not quite understand his wife It was odd how many things he did not
quite understand now about Kitty but that he knew must be HIS fault
But Mrs Barker apparently did not require after the fashion of her
sex a reply For the next moment as they moved towards their rooms
she said impatiently Well you dont tell what Stacy said Did you get
the money

I grieve to say that this soul of truth and frankness liedonly to his
wife Perhaps he considered it only lying to HIMSELF a thing of which
he was at times miserably conscious It wasnt necessary dear he
said he advised me to sell my securities in the bank and if you only
knew how dreadfully busy he is

Mrs Barker curled her pretty lip It doesnt take very long to lend
ten thousand dollars she said But thats what I always tell you
You have about made me sick by singing the praises of those wonderful
partners of yours and here you ask a favor of one of them and he tells
you to sell your securities And you know and he knows theyre worth
next to nothing

You dont understand dearbegan Barker

I understand that youve given your word to poor Harry said
Mrs Barker in pretty indignation whos responsible for the Ditch
purchase

And I shall keep it I always do said Barker very quietly but with
that same singular expression of face that had puzzled Stacy But
Mrs Barker who perhaps knew her husband better said in an altered
voice

But HOW can you dear

If Im short a thousand or two Ill ask your father

Mrs Barker was silent Fathers so very much harried now George Why
dont you simply throw the whole thing up

But Ive given my word to your cousin Henry

Yes but only your WORD There was no written agreement And you
couldnt even hold him to it

Barker opened his frank eyes in astonishment Her own cousin too And
they were Stacys very words

Besides added Mrs Barker audaciously he could get rid of it
elsewhere He had another offer but he thought yours the best So dont
be silly

By this time they had reached their rooms Barker apparently dismissing
the subject from his mind with characteristic buoyancy turned into the
bedroom and walked smilingly towards a small crib which stood in the
corner Why hes gone he said in some dismay

Well said Mrs Barker a little impatiently you didnt expect me to
take him into the public parlor where I was seeing visitors did you
I sent him out with the nurse into the lower hall to play with the other
children

A shade momentarily passed over Barkers face He always looked forward
to meeting the child when he came back He had a belief based on no
grounds whatever that the little creature understood him And he had a
fathers doubt of the wholesomeness of other peoples children who
were born into the world indiscriminately and not under the exceptional
conditions of his own Ill go and fetch him he said

You havent told me anything about your interview what you did and
what your good friend Stacy said said Mrs Barker dropping languidly
into a chair And really if you are simply running away again after
that child I might just as well have asked Captain Heath to stay
longer

Oh as to Stacy said Barker dropping beside her and taking her hand
well dear he was awfully busy you know and shut up in the innermost
office like the agate in one of the Japanese nests of boxes But he
continued brightening up just the same dear old Jim Stacy of Heavy
Tree Hill when I first knew you Lord dear how it all came back to
me That day I proposed to you in the belief that I was unexpectedly
rich and even bought a claim for the boys on the strength of it and how
I came back to them to find that they had made a big strike on the very
claim Lord I remember how I was so afraid to tell them about youand
how they guessed itthat dear old Stacy one of the first

Yes said Mrs Barker and I hope your friend Stacy remembered that
but for ME when you found out that you were not rich youd have given
up the claim but that I really deceived my own father to make you keep
it Ive often worried over that George she said pensively turning
a diamond bracelet around her pretty wrist although I never said
anything about it

But Kitty darling said Barker grasping his wifes hand I gave my
note for it you know you said that was bargain enough and I had better
wait until the note was due and until I found I couldnt pay before I
gave up the claim It was very clever of you and the boys all said so
too But you never deceived your father dear he said looking at her
gravely for I should have told him everything

Of course if you look at it in that way said his wife languidly
its nothing only I think it ought to be remembered when people go
about saying papa ruined you with his hotel schemes

Who dares say that said Barker indignantly

Well if they dont SAY it they look it said Mrs Barker with a
toss of her pretty head and I believe thats at the bottom of Stacys
refusal

But he never said a word Kitty said Barker flushing

There dont excite yourself George said Mrs Barker resignedly
but go for the baby I know youre dying to go and I suppose its time
Norah brought it upstairs

At any other time Barker would have lingered with explanations but just
then a deeper sense than usual of some misunderstanding made him anxious
to shorten this domestic colloquy He rose pressed his wifes hand and
went out But yet he was not entirely satisfied with himself for leaving
her I suppose it isnt right my going off as soon as I come in he
murmured reproachfully to himself but I think she wants the baby back
as much as I only womanlike she didnt care to let me know it

He reached the lower hall which he knew was a favorite promenade for
the nurses who were gathered at the farther end where a large window
looked upon Montgomery Street But Norah the Irish nurse was not among
them he passed through several corridors in his search but in vain
At last worried and a little anxious he turned to regain his rooms
through the long saloon where he had found his wife previously It
was deserted now the last caller had lefteven frivolity had its
prescribed limits He was consequently startled by a gentle murmur
from one of the heavily curtained window recesses It was a womans
voicelow sweet caressing and filled with an almost pathetic
tenderness And it was followed by a distinct gurgling satisfied crow

Barker turned instantly in that direction A step brought him to the
curtain where a singular spectacle presented itself

Seated on a lounge completely absorbed and possessed by her treasure
was the horrid woman whom his wife had indicated only a little while
ago holding a babyKittys sacred babyin her wanton lap The child
was feebly grasping the end of the slender jeweled necklace which the
woman held temptingly dangling from a thin white jeweled finger above
it But its eyes were beaming with an intense delight as if trying to
respond to the deep concentrated love in the handsome face that was
bent above it

At the sudden intrusion of Barker she looked up There was a faint rise
in her color but no loss of sellpossession

Please dont scold the nurse she said nor say anything to Mrs
Barker It is all my fault I thought that both the nurse and child
looked dreadfully bored with each other and I borrowed the little
fellow for a while to try and amuse him At least I havent made
him cry have I dear The last epithet it is needless to say
was addressed to the little creature in her lap but in its tender
modulation it touched the fathers quick sympathies as if he had shared
it with the child You see she said softly disengaging the baby
fingers from her necklace that OUR sex is not the only one tempted by
jewelry and glitter

Barker hesitated the Madonnalike devotion of a moment ago was gone
it was only the woman of the world who laughingly looked up at him
Nevertheless he was touched Have youeverhad a child Mrs
Horncastle he asked gently and hesitatingly He had a vague
recollection that she passed for a widow and in his simple eyes all
women were virgins or married saints

No she said abruptly Then she added with a laugh Or perhaps
I should not admire them so much I suppose its the same feeling
bachelors have for other peoples wives But I know youre dying to
take that boy from me Take him then and dont be ashamed to carry him
yourself just because Im here you know you would delight to do it if I
werent

Barker bent over the silken lap in which the child was comfortably
nestling and in that attitude had a faint consciousness that Mrs
Horncastle was mischievously breathing into his curls a silent laugh
Barker lifted his firstborn with proud skillfulness but that sagacious
infant evidently knew when he was comfortable and in a paroxysm of
objection caught his fathers curls with one fist while with the other
he grasped Mrs Horncastles brown braids and brought their heads into
contact Upon which humorous situation Norah the nurse entered

Its all right Norah said Mrs Horncastle laughing as she
disengaged herself from the linking child Mr Barker has claimed
the baby and has agreed to forgive you and me and say nothing to Mrs
Barker Norah with the inscrutable criticism of her sex on her sex
thought it extremely probable and halted with exasperating discretion
There continued Mrs Horncastle playfully evading the childs
further advances go with papa thats a dear Mr Barker prefers to
carry him back Norah

But said the ingenuous and persistent Barker still lingering
in hopes of recalling the womans previous expression you DO love
children and you think him a bright little chap for his age

Yes said Mrs Horncastle putting back her loosened braid so round
and fat and soft And such a discriminating eye for jewelry Really you
ought to get a necklace like mine for Mrs Barkerit would please both
you know She moved slowly away the united efforts of Norah and Barker
scarcely sufficing to restrain the struggling child from leaping after
her as she turned at the door and blew him a kiss

When Barker regained his room he found that Mrs Barker had dismissed
Stacy from her mind except so far as to invoke Norahs aid in laying
out her smartest gown for dinner But why take all this trouble dear
said her simpleminded husband we are going to dine in a private room
so that we can talk over old times all by ourselves and any dress would
suit him And Lord dear he added with a quick brightening at the
fancy if you could only just rig yourself up in that pretty lilac gown
you used to wear at Boomvilleit would be too killing and just like
old times I put it away myself in one of our trunksI couldnt bear
to leave it behind I know just where it is IllBut Mrs Barkers
restraining scorn withheld him

George Barker if you think I am going to let you throw away and
utterly WASTE Mr Stacy on us alone in a private room with closed
doorsand I dare say youd like to sit in your dressinggown and
slippersyou are entirely mistaken I know what is due not to your old
partner but to the great Mr Stacy the financier and I know what is
due FROM HIM TO US No We dine in the great diningroom publicly and
if possible at the very next table to those stuckup Peterburys and
their Eastern friends including that horrid woman which Im sure
ought to satisfy you Then you can talk as much as you like and as
loud as you like about old timesand the louder and the more the
betterbut I dont think HELL like it

But the baby expostulated Barker Stacys just wild to see himand
we cant bring him down to the tablethough we MIGHT he added
momentarily brightening

After dinner said Mrs Barker severely we will walk through the big
drawingrooms and THEN Mr Stacy may come upstairs and see him in his
crib but not before And now George I do wish that tonight FOR
ONCE you would not wear a turndown collar and that you would go to
the barbers and have him cut your hair and smooth out the curls And
for Heavens sake let him put some wax or gum or SOMETHING on your
mustache and twist it up on your cheek like Captain Heaths for it
positively droops over your mouth like a girls ringlet Its quite
enough for me to hear people talk of your inexperience but really I
dont want you to look as if I had run away with a pretty schoolboy
And considering the size of that child its positively disgraceful
And one thing more George When Im talking to anybody please dont
sit opposite to me beaming with delight and your mouth open And dont
roar if by chance I say something funny Andwhatever you dodont
make eyes at me in company whenever I happen to allude to you as I did
before Captain Heath It is positively too ridiculous

Nothing could exceed the laughing good humor with which her husband
received these cautions nor the evident sincerity with which he
promised amendment Equally sincere was he though a little more
thoughtful in his severe selfexamination of his deficiencies when
later he seated himself at the window with one hand softly encompassing
his childs chubby fist in the crib beside him and in the instinctive
fashion of all loneliness looked out of the window The southern
trades were whipping the waves of the distant bay and harbor into yeasty
crests Sheets of rain swept the sidewalks with the regularity of a
fusillade against which a few pedestrians struggled with flapping
waterproofs and slanting umbrellas He could look along the deserted
length of Montgomery Street to the heights of Telegraph Hill and its
longdisused semaphore It seemed lonelier to him than the milelong
sweep of Heavy Tree Hill writhing against the mountain wind and
its aeolian song He had never felt so lonely THERE In his rigid
selfexamination he thought Kitty right in protesting against the
effect of his youthfulness and optimism Yet he was also right in being
himself There is an egoism in the highest simplicity and Barker while
willing to believe in others methods never abandoned his own aims
He was right in loving Kitty as he did he knew that she was better and
more lovable than she could believe herself to be but he was willing to
believe it pained and discomposed her if he showed it before company
He would not have her change even this peculiarityit was part of
herselfno more than he would have changed himself And behind what he
had conceived was her clear practical common sense all this time had
been her belief that she had deceived her father Poor dear dear Kitty
And she had suffered because stupid people had conceived that her father
had led him away in selfish speculations As if heBarkerwould
not have first discovered it and as if anybodyeven dear Kitty
herselfwas responsible for HIS convictions and actions but himself
Nevertheless this gentle egotist was unusually serious and when the
child awoke at last and with a fretful start and vacant eyes pushed his
caressing hand away he felt lonelier than before It was with a slight
sense of humiliation too that he saw it stretch its hands to the mere
hireling Norah who had never given it the love that he had seen even
in the frivolous Mrs Horncastles eyes Later when his wife came in
looking very pretty in her elaborate dinner toilette he had the same
conflicting emotions He knew that they had already passed that phase
of their married life when she no longer dressed to please him and
that the dictates of fashion or the rivalry of another woman she held
superior to his tastes yet he did not blame her But he was a little
surprised to see that her dress was copied from one of Mrs Horncastles
most striking ones and that it did not suit her That which adorned
the maturer woman did not agree with the demure and slightly austere
prettiness of the young wife

But Barker forgot all this when Stacyreserved and somewhat
severelooking in evening dressarrived with business punctuality He
fancied that his old partner received the announcement that they would
dine in the public room with something of surprise and he saw him
glance keenly at Kitty in her fine array as if he had suspected it was
her choice and understood her motives Indeed the young husband had
found himself somewhat nervous in regard to Stacys estimate of Kitty
he was conscious that she was not looking and acting like the old Kitty
that Stacy had known it did not enter his honest heart that Stacy had
perhaps not appreciated her then and that her present quality might
accord more with his worldly tastes and experience It was therefore
with a kind of timid delight that he saw Stacy apparently enter into her
mood and with a still more timorous amusement to notice that he
seemed to sympathize not only with her but with her halfrallying
halfserious attitude towards his Barkers inexperience and
simplicity He was glad that she had made a friend of Stacy even in
this way Stacy would understand as he did her pretty willfulness at
last she would understand what a true friend Stacy was to him It was
with unfeigned satisfaction that he followed them in to dinner as she
leaned upon his guests arm chatting confidentially He was only uneasy
because her manner had a slight ostentation

The entrance of the little party produced a quick sensation throughout
the diningroom Whispers passed from table to table all heads were
turned towards the great financier as towards a magnet a few guests
even shamelessly faced round in their chairs as he passed Mrs Barker
was pink pretty and voluble with excitement Stacy had a slight mask
of reserve Barker was the only one natural and unconscious

As the dinner progressed Barker found that there was little chance for
him to invoke his old partners memories of the past He found however
that Stacy had received a letter from Demorest and that he was coming
home from Europe His letters were still sad they both agreed upon
that And then for the first time that day Stacy looked intently at
Barker with the look that he had often worn on Heavy Tree Hill

Then you think it is the same old trouble that worries him said
Barker in an awed and sympathetic voice

I believe it is said Stacy with an equal feeling Mrs Barker
pricked up her pretty ears her husbands ready sympathy was familiar
enough but that this cold practical Stacy should be moved at anything
piqued her curiosity

And you believe that he has never got over it continued Barker

He had one chance but he threw it away said Stacy energetically
If instead of going off to Europe by himself to brood over it he had
joined me in business hed have been another man

But not Demorest said Barker quickly

What dreadful secret is this about Demorest said Mrs Barker
petulantly Is he ill

Both men were silent by their old common instinct But it was Stacy
who said No in a way that put any further questioning at an end and
Barker was grateful and for the moment disloyal to his Kitty

It was with delight that Mrs Barker had seen that the attention of
the next table was directed to them and that even Mrs Horncastle had
glanced from time to time at Stacy But she was not prepared for the
evident equal effect that Mrs Horncastle had created upon Stacy His
cold face warmed his critical eye softened he asked her name Mrs
Barker was voluble prejudiced and it seemed misinformed

I know it all said Stacy with didactic emphasis Her husband was as
bad as they make them When her life had become intolerable WITH HIM he
tried to make it shameful WITHOUT HIM by abandoning her She could get a
divorce a dozen times over but she wont

I suppose thats what makes her so very attractive to gentlemen said
Mrs Barker ironically

I have never seen her before continued Stacy with business
precision although I and two other men are guardians of her property
and have saved it from the clutches of her husband They told me she was
handsomeand so she is

Pleased with the sudden human weakness of Stacy Barker glanced at his
wife for sympathy But she was looking studiously another way and the
young husbands eyes still full of his gratification fell upon
Mrs Horncastles She looked away with a bright color Whereupon
the sanguine Barkerperfectly convinced that she returned Stacys
admirationwas seized with one of his old boyish dreams of the future
and saw Stacy happily united to her and was only recalled to the dinner
before him by its end Then Stacy duly promenaded the great saloon with
Mrs Barker on his arm visited the baby in her apartments and took an
easy leave But he grasped Barkers hand before parting in quite his old
fashion and said Come to lunch with me at the bank any day and well
talk of Phil Demorest and left Barker as happy as if the appointment
were to confer the favor he had that morning refused But Mrs Barker
who had overheard was more dubious

You dont suppose he asks you to talk with you about Demorest and his
stupid secret do you she said scornfully

Perhaps not only about that said Barker glad that she had not
demanded the secret

Well returned Mrs Barker as she turned away he might just as well
lunch here and talk about HERand see her too

Meantime Stacy had dropped into his club only a few squares distant
His appearance created the same interest that it had produced at the
hotel but with less reserve among his fellow members

Have you heard the news said a dozen voices Stacy had not he had
been dining out

That infernal swindle of a Divide Railroad has passed the legislature

Stacy instantly remembered Barkers absurd belief in it and his reasons
He smiled and said carelessly Are you quite sure its a swindle

There was a dead silence at the coolness of the man who had been most
outspoken against it

But said a voice hesitatingly you know it goes nowhere and to no
purpose

But that does not prevent it now that its a fact from going anywhere
and to some purpose said Stacy turning away He passed into the
readingroom quietly but in an instant turned and quickly descended
by another staircase into the hall hurriedly put on his overcoat and
slipping out was a moment later reentering the hotel Here he hastily
summoned Barker who came down flushed and excited Laying his hand on
Barkers arm in his old dominant way he said

Dont delay a single hour but get a written agreement for that Ditch
property

Barker smiled But I have Got it this afternoon

Then you know ejaculated Stacy in surprise

I only know said Barker coloring that you said I could back out of
it if it wasnt signed and thats what Kitty said too And I thought
it looked awfully mean for me to hold a man to that kind of a bargain
And soyou wont be mad old fellow will youI thought Id put
it beyond any question of my own good faith by having it in black
and white He stopped laughing and blushing but still earnest and
sincere You dont think me a fool do you he said pathetically

Stacy smiled grimly I think Barker boy that if you go to the Branch
youll have no difficulty in paying for the Ditch property Goodnight

In a few moments he was back at the club again before any one knew he
had even left the building As he again reentered the smokingroom he
found the members still in eager discussion about the new railroad One
was saying If they could get an extension and carry the road through
Heavy Tree Hill to Boomville theyd be all right

I quite agree with you said Stacy




CHAPTER III


The swaying creaking Boomville coach had at last reached the level
ridge and sank forward upon its springs with a sigh of relief and the
slow precipitation of the red dust which had hung in clouds around
it The whole coach inside and out was covered with this impalpable
powder it had poured into the windows that gaped widely in the
insufferable heat it lay thick upon the novel read by the passenger who
had for the third or fourth time during the ascent made a gutter of
the halfopened book and blown the dust away in a single puff like the
smoke from a pistol It lay in folds and creases over the yellow silk
duster of the handsome woman on the back seat and when she endeavored
to shake it off enveloped her in a reddish nimbus It grimed the
handkerchiefs of others and left sanguinary streaks on their mopped
foreheads But as the coach had slowly climbed the summit the sun
was also sinking behind the Black Spur Range and with its ultimate
disappearance a delicious coolness spread itself like a wave across the
ridge The passengers drew a long breath the reader closed his book
the lady lifted the edge of her veil and delicately wiped her
forehead over which a few damp tendrils of hair were clinging Even a
distinguishedlooking man who had sat as impenetrable and remote as a
statue in one of the front seats moved and turned his abstracted face to
the window His deeply tanned cheek and clearly cut features harmonized
with the red dust that lay in the curves of his brown linen dustcloak
and completed his resemblance to a bronze figure Yet it was Demorest
changed only in coloring Now as five years ago his abstraction had a
certain quality which the most familiar stranger shrank from disturbing
But in the general relaxation of relief the novelreader addressed him

Well we aint far from Boomville now and its all downgrade the rest
of the way I reckon youll be as glad to get a wash up and a shake
as the rest of us

I am afraid I wont have so early an opportunity said Demorest with
a faint grave smile for I get off at the crossroad to Heavy Tree
Hill

Heavy Tree Hill repeated the other in surprise You aint goin to
Heavy Tree Hill Why you might have gone there direct by railroad
and have been there four hours ago You know theres a branch from the
Divide Railroad goes there straight to the hotel at Hymettus

Where said Demorest with a puzzled smile

Hymettus Thats the fancy name theyve given to the wateringplace on
the slope But I reckon youre a stranger here

For five years said Demorest I fancy Ive heard of the railroad
although I prefer to go to Heavy Tree this way But I never heard of a
wateringplace there before

Why its the biggest boom of the year Folks that are tired of the
fogs of Frisco and the heat of Sacramento all go there Its four
thousand feet up with a hotel like Saratoga dancing and a band plays
every night And it all sprang out of the Divide Railroad and a crank
named George Barker who bought up some old Ditch property and ran a
branch line along its levels and made a junction with the Divide You
can come all the way from Frisco or Sacramento by rail Its a mighty
big thing

Yet said Demorest with some animation you call the man who
originated this success a crank I should say he was a genius

The other passenger shook his head All sheer nigger luck He bought
the Ditch plant afore there was a ghost of a chance for the Divide
Railroad just out o pure dd foolishness He expected so little
from it that he hadnt even got the agreement done in writin and
hadnt paid for it when the Divide Railroad passed the legislature as
it never oughter done For you see the blamedest curous thing about
the whole affair was that this straw road of a Divide all pure
wildcat was only gotten up to frighten the Pacific Railroad sharps into
buying it up And the road that nobody ever calculated would ever have a
rail of it laid was pushed on as soon as folks knew that the Ditch plant
had been bought up for they thought there was a big thing behind it
Even the hotel was at first simply a kind of genteel almshouse that
this yer Barker had built for brokendown miners

Nevertheless continued Demorest smiling you admit that it is a
great success

Yes said the other a little irritated by some complacency in
Demorests smile but the success isnt HISN Fools has ideas and
wise men profit by them for that hotel now has Jim Stacys bank behind
it and is even a kind of country branch of the Brook House in Frisco
Barkers out of it I reckon Anyhow HE couldnt run a hotel for all
that his wifeshe thats one of the big Frisco swells nowused to
help serve in her fathers No sir its just a fools luck gettin
the first taste and leavin the rest to others

Im not sure that its the worst kind of luck returned Demorest
with persistent gravity and I suppose hes satisfied with it But so
heterodox an opinion only irritated his antagonist the more especially
as he noticed that the handsome woman in the back seat appeared to be
interested in the conversation and even sympathetic with Demorest The
man was in the main a goodnatured fellow and loyal to his friends but
this did not preclude any virulent criticism of others and for a moment
he hated this bronzefaced stranger and even saw blemishes in the
handsome womans beauty That may be YOUR idea of an Eastern man
he said bluntly but I kin tell ye that Californy aint run on those
lines No sir Nevertheless his curiosity got the better of his ill
humor and as the coach at last pulled up at the crossroad for Demorest
to descend he smiled affably at his departing companion

You allowed just now that youd bin five years away Whar mout ye have
bin

In Europe said Demorest pleasantly

I reckoned ez much returned his interrogator smiling significantly
at the other passengers But in what place

Oh many said Demorest smiling also

But what place war ye last livin at

Well said Demorest descending the steps but lingering for a moment
with his hand on the door of the coach oddly enough now you remind me
of itat Hymettus

He closed the door and the coach rolled on The passenger reddened
glanced indignantly after the departing figure of Demorest and
suspiciously at the others The lady was looking from the window with a
faint smile on her face

He might hev given me a civil answer muttered the passenger and
resumed his novel

When the coach drew up before Carters Hotel the lady got down and the
curiosity of her susceptible companions was gratified to the extent of
learning from the register that her name was Horncastle

She was shown to a private sittingroom which chanced to be the one
which had belonged to Mrs Barker in the days of her maidenhood and
was the sacred impenetrable bower to which she retired when her daily
duties of waiting upon her fathers guests were over But the breath of
custom had passed through it since then and but little remained of its
former maiden glories except a few schoolgirl crayon drawings on
the wall and an unrecognizable portrait of herself in oil done by a
wandering artist and still preserved as a receipt for his unpaid
bill Of these facts Mrs Horncastle knew nothing she was evidently
preoccupied and after she had removed her outer duster and entered the
room she glanced at the clock on the mantelshelf and threw herself
with an air of resigned abstraction in an armchair in the corner Her
travelingdress although unostentatious was tasteful and wellfitting
a slight pallor from her fatiguing journey and perhaps from some
absorbing thought made her beauty still more striking She gave even an
air of elegance to the faded worn adornments of the room which it is
to be feared it never possessed in Miss Kittys occupancy Again she
glanced at the clock There was a tap at the door

Come in

The door opened to a Chinese servant bearing a piece of torn paper with
a name written on it in lieu of a card

Mrs Horncastle took it glanced at the name and handed the paper back

There must be some mistake she said it do not know Mr Steptoe

No but you know ME all the same said a voice from the doorway as a
man entered coolly took the Chinese servant by the elbows and thrust
him into the passage closing the door upon him Steptoe and Horncastle
are the same man only I prefer to call myself Steptoe HERE And I see
YOURE down on the register as Horncastle Well its plucky of you
and its not a bad name to keep you might be thankful that I have
always left it to you And if I call myself Steptoe here its a good
blind against any of your swell friends knowing you met your HUSBAND
here

In the halfscornful halfresigned look she had given him when he
entered there was no doubt that she recognized him as the man she had
come to see He had changed little in the five years that had elapsed
since he entered the three partners cabin at Heavy Tree Hill His short
hair and beard still clung to his head like curled moss or the crisp
flocculence of Astrakhan He was dressed more pretentiously but still
gave the same idea of vulgar strength She listened to him without
emotion but said with even a deepening of scorn in her manner

What new shame is this

Nothing NEW he replied Only five years ago I was livin over on the
Bar at Heavy Tree Hill under the name of Steptoe and folks here might
recognize me I was here when your particular friend Jim Stacy
who only knew me as Steptoe and doesnt know me as Horncastle your
HUSBANDfor all hes bound up my property for youmade his big
strike with his two partners I was in his cabin that very night and
drank his whiskey Oh Im all right there I left everything all right
behind meonly its just as well he doesnt know Im Horncastle And
as the boy happened to be there with meHe stopped and looked at her
significantly

The expression of her face changed Eagerness anxiety and even fear
came into it in turn but always mingling with some scorn that dominated
her The boy she said in a voice that had changed too well what
about him You promised to tell me allall

Wheres the money he said Husband and wife are ONE I know
he went on with a coarse laugh but I dont trust MYSELF in these
matters

She took from a travelingreticule that lay beside her a roll of notes
and a chamois leather bag of coin and laid them on the table before
him He examined both carefully

All right he said I see youve got the checks made out to bearer
Your heads level Conny Pity you and me cant agree

I went to the bank across the way as soon as I arrived she said with
contemptuous directness I told them I was going over to Hymettus and
might want money

He dropped into a chair before her with his broad heavy hands upon his
knees and looked at her with an equal though baser contempt for his
was mingled with a certain pride of mastery and possession

And of course youll go to Hymettus and cut a splurge as you always
do The beautiful Mrs Horncastle The helpless victim of a wretched
dissipated disgraced gambling husband So dreadfully sad you know
and so interesting Could get a divorce from the brute if she wanted
but wont on account of her religious scruples And so while the brute
is gambling swindling disgracing himself and dodging a shot here
and a lynch committee there two or three hundred miles away youre
splurging round in firstclass hotels and wateringplaces doing the
injured and abused and run after by a lot of men who are ready to take
my place and maybe some of my reputation along with it

Stop she said suddenly in a voice that made the glass chandelier
ring He had risen too with a quick uneasy glance towards the door
But her outbreak passed as suddenly and sinking back into her chair
she said with her previous scornful resignation Never mind Go on
You KNOW youre lying

He sat down again and looked at her critically Yes as far as youre
concerned I WAS lying I know your style But as you know too that
Id kill you and the first man I suspected and there aint a judge or
a jury in all Californy that wouldnt let me go free for it and even
consider too that it had wiped off the whole slate agin meits to my
credit

I know what you men call chivalry she said coldly but I did not
come here to buy a knowledge of that So now about the child she ended
abruptly leaning forward again with the same look of eager solicitude
in her eyes

Well about the childour childthough perhaps I prefer to say MY
child he began with a certain brutal frankness Ill tell you But
first I dont want you to talk about BUYING your information of me
If I havent told you anything before its because I didnt think you
oughter know If I didnt trust the child to YOU its because I didnt
think you could go shashaying about with a child that was three years
old when Ihe stopped and wiped his mouth with the back of his
handmade an honest woman of youI think thats what they call it

But she said eagerly ignoring the insult I could have hidden it
where no one but myself would have known it I could have sent it to
school and visited it as a relation

Yes he said curtly like all women and then blurted it out some day
and made it worse

But she said desperately even THEN suppose I had been willing to
take the shame of it I have taken more

But I didnt intend that you should he said roughly

You are very careful of my reputation she returned scornfully

Not by a dd sight he burst out but I care for HIS Im not
goin to let any man call him a bastard

Callous as she had become even under this last cruel blow she could not
but see something in his coarse eyes she had never seen before could
not but hear something in his brutal voice she had never heard before
Was it possible that somewhere in the depths of his sordid nature he had
his own contemptible sense of honor A hysterical feeling came over her
hitherto passive disgust and scorn but it disappeared with his next
sentence in a haze of anxiety No he said hoarsely he had enough
wrong done him already

What do you mean she said imploringly Or are you again lying You
said four years ago that he had got into trouble that was your
excuse for keeping him from me Or was that a lie too

His manner changed and softened but not for any pity for his companion
but rather from some change in his own feelings Oh that he said
with a rough laugh that was only a kind o trouble any sassy kid like
him was likely to get into You aint got no call to hear that for he
added with a momentary return to his previous manner the wrong that
was done him is MY lookout You want to know what I did with him how
hes been looked arter and where he is You want the worth of your
money Thats square enough But first I want you to know though you
maynt believe it that every red cent youve given me tonight goes to
HIM And dont you forget it

For all his vulgar frankness she knew he had lied to her many times
beforemaliciously wantonly complacently but never evasively yet
there was again that something in his manner which told her he was now
telling the truth

Well he began settling himself back in his chair I told you I
brought him to Heavy Tree Hill After I left you I wasnt going to trust
him to no school he knew enough for me but when I left those parts
where nobody knew you and got a little nearer Frisco where people
might have known us both I thought it better not to travel round with a
kid o that size as his FATHER So I got a young fellow here to pass him
off as HIS little brother and look after him and board him and I paid
him a big price for it too you bet You wouldnt think it was a man
whos now swelling around here the top o the pile that ever took
money from a brute like me and for such schoolmaster work too but he
did and his name was Van Loo a clerk of the Ditch Company

Van Loo said the woman with a movement of disgust THAT man

Whats the matter with Van Loo he said with a coarse laugh enjoying
his wifes discomfiture He speaks French and Spanish and you oughter
hear the kid roll off the lingo hes got from him Hes got style and
knows how to dress and you ought to see the kid bow and scrape and how
he carries himself Now Van Loo wasnt exactly my style and I reckon I
dont hanker after him much but he served my purpose

And this man knowsshe said with a shudder

He knows Steptoe and the boy but he dont know Horncastle nor YOU
Dont you be skeert Hes the last man in the world who would hanker to
see me or the kid again or would dare to say that he ever had Lord
Id like to see his fastidious mug if me and Eddy walked in upon him and
his hightoned mother and sister some arternoon He threw himself back
and laughed a derisive spasmodic choking laugh which was so far from
being genial that it even seemed to indicate a lively appreciation of
pain in others rather than of pleasure in himself He had often laughed
at her in the same way

And where is he now she said with a compressed lip

At school Where I dont tell you You know why But hes looked after
by me and dd well looked after too

She hesitated composed her face with an effort parted her lips and
looked out of the window into the gathering darkness Then after a
moment she said slowly yet with a certain precision

And his mother Do you ever talk to him of HER Doesdoes he ever
speak of ME

What do you think he said comfortably changing his position in the
chair and trying to read her face in the shadow Come now You dont
know eh Wellno NO You understand No Hes MY friendMINE Hes
stood by me through thick and thin Run at my heels when everybody else
fled me Dodged vigilance committees with me laid out in the brush with
me with his hand in mine when the sheriffs deputies were huntin me
shut his jaw close when if he squealed hed have been called another
victim of the brute Horncastle and been as petted and canoodled as
you

It would have been difficult for any one but the woman who knew the man
before her to have separated his brutish delight in paining her from
another feeling she had never dreamt him capable ofan intense
and fierce pride in his affection for his child And it was the more
hopeless to her that it was not the mere sentiment of reciprocation
but the material instinct of paternity in its most animal form And it
seemed horrible to her that the only outcome of what had been her own
wild youthful passion for this brute was this love for the flesh of her
flesh for she was more and more conscious as he spoke that her
yearning for the boy was the yearning of an equally dumb and unreasoning
maternity They had met again as animalsin fear contempt and anger
of each other but the animal had triumphed in both

When she spoke again it was as the woman of the worldthe woman who
had laughed two years ago at the irrepressible Barker Its a new
thing she said languidly turning her rings on her fingers to see
you in the role of a doting father And may I ask how long you have had
this amiable weakness and how long it is to last

To her surprise and the keen retaliating delight of her sex a conscious
flush covered his face to the crisp edges of his black and matted beard
For a moment she hoped that he had lied But to her greater surprise
he stammered in equal frankness Its growed upon me for the last five
yearsever since I was alone with him He stopped cleared his throat
and then standing up before her said in his former voice but with a
more settled and intense deliberation You wanter know how long it
will last do ye Well you know your special friend Jim Stacythe big
millionairethe great Jim of the Stock Exchangethe man that pinches
the money market of Californy between his finger and thumb and makes it
squeal in New Yorkthe man who shakes the stock market when he sneezes
Well it will go on until that man is a beggar until he has to borrow
a dime for his breakfast and slump out of his lunch with a cents
worth of rat poison or a bullet in his head Itll go on until his old
partnerthat softy George Barkercomes to the bottom of his dd
fool luck and is a pennyaliner for the papers and a hangerround at
free lunches and his scatterbrained wife runs away with another man
Itll go on until the hightoned Demorest the last of those three
little tin gods of Heavy Tree Hill will have to climb down and will
know what I feel and what hes made me feel and will wish himself in
hell before he ever made the big strike on Heavy Tree Thats me You
hear me Im shoutin Itll last till then It may be next week next
month next year But itll come And when it does come youll see me
and Eddy just waltzin in and takin the chief seats in the synagogue
And youll have a free pass to the show

Either he was too intoxicated with his vengeful vision or the shadows
of the room had deepened but he did not see the quick flush that
had risen to his wifes face with this allusion to Barker nor the
aftersettling of her handsome features into a dogged determination
equal to his own His blind fury against the three partners did not
touch her curiosity she was only struck with the evident depth of his
emotion He had never been a braggart his hostility had always been
lazy and cynical Remembering this she had a faint stirring of respect
for the undoubted courage and consciousness of strength shown in
this wild but singlehanded crusade against wealth and power rather
perhaps it seemed to her to condone her own weakness in her youthful
and inexplicable passion for him No wonder she had submitted

Then you have nothing more to tell me she said after a pause rising
and going towards the mantel

You neednt light up for me he returned rising also I am going
Unless he added with his coarse laugh you think it wouldnt look
well for Mrs Horncastle to have been sitting in the dark witha
stranger He paused as she contemptuously put down the candlestick and
threw the unlit match into the grate No Ive nothing more to tell
Hes a fancylooking pup Youd take him for twentyone though hes
only sixteencleanlimbed and perfectbut for one thingHe stopped
He met her quick look of interrogation however with a lowering silence
that nevertheless changed again as he surveyed her erect figure by
the faint light of the window with a sardonic smile He favors you I
think and in all but one thing too

And that she queried coldly as he seemed to hesitate

He aint ashamed of ME he returned with a laugh

The door closed behind him she heard his heavy step descend the
creaking stairs he was gone She went to the window and threw it
open as if to get rid of the atmosphere charged with his presencea
presence still so potent that she now knew that for the last five
minutes she had been to her horror struggling against its magnetism
She even recoiled now at the thought of her child as if in these new
confidences over it it had revived the old intimacy in this link
of their common flesh She looked down from her window on the square
shoulders thick throat and crisp matted hair of her husband as he
vanished in the darkness and drew a breath of freedoma freedom not
so much from him as from her own weakness that he was bearing away with
him into the exonerating night

She shut the window and sank down in her chair again but in the
encompassing and compassionate obscurity of the room And this was the
man she had loved and for whom she had wrecked her young life Or WAS
it love and if NOT how was she better than he Worse for he was
more loyal to that passion that had brought them together and its
responsibilities than she was She had suffered the perils and pangs of
maternity and yet had only the mere animal yearning for her offspring
while he had taken over the toil and duty and even the devotion of
parentage himself But then she remembered also how he had fascinated
hera simple schoolgirlby his sheer domineering strength and how the
objections of her parents to this coarse and common man had forced her
into a clandestine intimacy that ended in her complete subjection to
him She remembered the birth of an infant whose concealment from her
parents and friends was compassed by his low cunning she remembered the
late atonement of marriage preferred by the man she had already begun
to loathe and fear and who she now believed was eager only for her
inheritance She remembered her abject compliance through the greater
fear of the world the stormy scenes that followed their illomened
union her final abandonment of her husband and the efforts of her
friends and family who had rescued the last of her property from him
She was glad she remembered it she dwelt upon it upon his cruelty his
coarseness and vulgarity until she saw as she honestly believed the
hidden springs of his affection for their child It was HIS child in
nature however it might have favored her in looks it was HIS own
brutal SELF he was worshiping in his brutal progeny How else could it
have ignored HERits own mother She never doubted the truth of what
he had told hershe had seen it in his own triumphant eyes And yet she
would have made a kind mother she remembered with a smile and a slight
rising of color the affection of Barkers baby for her she remembered
with a deepening of that color the thrill of satisfaction she had felt
in her husbands fulmination against Mrs Barker and more than all
she felt in his blind and foolish hatred of Barker himself a delicious
condonation of the strange feeling that had sprung up in her heart for
Barkers simple straightforward nature How could HE understand
how could THEY understand by the plural she meant Mrs Barker and
Horncastle a character so innately noble In her strange attraction
towards him she had felt a charming sense of what she believed was a
superior and even matronly protection in the utter isolation of her
life nowand with her husbands foolish abuse of him ringing in her
earsit seemed a sacred duty She had lost a son Providence had sent
her an ideal friend to replace him And this was quite consistent too
with a faint smile that began to play about her mouth as she recalled
some instances of Barkers delightful and irresistible youthfulness

There was a clatter of hoofs and the sound of many voices from the
street Mrs Horncastle knew it was the down coach changing horses it
would be off again in a few moments and no doubt bearing her husband
away with it A new feeling of relief came over her as she at last heard
the warning All aboard and the great vehicle clattered and rolled
into the darkness trailing its burning lights across her walls and
ceiling But now she heard steps on the staircase a pause before her
room a whisper of voices the opening of the door the rustle of a
skirt and a little feminine cry of protest as a man apparently tried to
follow the figure into the room No no I tell you NO remonstrated
the womans voice in a hurried whisper It wont do Everybody knows
me here You must not come in now You must wait to be announced by the
servant Hush Go

There was a slight struggle the sound of a kiss and the woman
succeeded in finally shutting the door Then she walked slowly but with
a certain familiarity towards the mantel struck a match and lit the
candle The light shone upon the bright eyes and slightly flushed face
of Mrs Barker But the motionless woman in the chair had recognized her
voice and the voice of her companion at once And then their eyes met

Mrs Barker drew back but did not utter a cry Mrs Horncastle with
eyes even brighter than her companions smiled The red deepened in
Mrs Barkers cheek

This is my room she said indignantly with a sweeping gesture around
the walls

I should judge so said Mrs Horncastle following the gesture but
she added quietly they put ME into it It appears however they did
not expect you

Mrs Barker saw her mistake No no she said apologetically of
course not Then she added with nervous volubility sitting down and
tugging at her gloves You see I just ran down from Marysville to take
a look at my fathers old house on my way to Hymettus I hope I havent
disturbed you Perhaps she said with sudden eagerness you were
asleep when I came in

No said Mrs Horncastle I was not sleeping nor dreaming I heard
you come in

Some of these men are such idiots said Mrs Barker with a
halfhysterical laugh They seem to think if a woman accepts the least
courtesy from them theyve a right to be familiar But I fancy that
fellow was a little astonished when I shut the door in his face

I fancy he WAS returned Mrs Horncastle dryly But I shouldnt call
Mr Van Loo an idiot He has the reputation of being a cautious business
man

Mrs Barker bit her lip Her companion had been recognized She rose
with a slight flirt of her skirt I suppose I must go and get a room
there was nobody in the office when I came Everything is badly managed
here since my father took away the best servants to Hymettus She
moved with affected carelessness towards the door when Mrs Horncastle
without rising from her seat said

Why not stay here

Mrs Barker brightened for a moment Oh she said with polite
deprecation I couldnt think of turning you out

I dont intend you shall said Mrs Horncastle We will stay here
together until you go with me to Hymettus or until Mr Van Loo leaves
the hotel He will hardly attempt to come in here again if I remain

Mrs Barker with a halflaugh sat down irresolutely Mrs Horncastle
gazed at her curiously she was evidently a novice in this sort of
thing But strange to sayand I leave the ethics of this for the sex
to settlethe fact did not soften Mrs Horncastles heart nor in the
least qualify her attitude towards the younger woman After an
awkward pause Mrs Barker rose again Well its very good of you
andandIll just run out and wash my hands and get the dust off me
and come back

No Mrs Barker said Mrs Horncastle rising and approaching her
you will first wash your hands of this Mr Van Loo and get some of the
dust of the rendezvous off you before you do anything else You CAN do
it by simply telling him SHOULD YOU MEET HIM IN THE HALL that I was
sitting here when he came in and heard EVERYTHING Depend upon it he
wont trouble you again

But Mrs Barker though inexperienced in love was a good fighter
The best of the sex are She dropped into the rockingchair and began
rocking backwards and forwards while still tugging at her gloves and
said in a gradually warming voice I certainly shall not magnify Mr
Van Loos silliness to that importance And I have yet to learn what you
mean by talking about a rendezvous And I want to know she continued
suddenly stopping her rocking and tilting the rockers impertinently
behind her as with her elbows squared on the chair arms she tilted
her own face defiantly up into Mrs Horncastles how a woman in your
positionwho doesnt live with her husbanddares to talk to ME

There was a lull before the storm Mrs Horncastle approached nearer
and laying her hand on the back of the chair leaned over her and
with a white face and a metallic ring in her voice said It is just
because I am a woman IN MY POSITION that I do It is because I dont
live with my husband that I can tell you what it will be when you no
longer live with yourswhich will be the inevitable result of what you
are now doing It is because I WAS in this position that the very man
who is pursuing you because he thinks you are discontented with YOUR
husband once thought he could pursue me because I had left MINE You
are here with him alone without the knowledge of your husband call it
folly caprice vanity or what you like it can have but one endto
put you in my place at last to be considered the fair game afterwards
for any man who may succeed him You can test him and the truth of what
I say by telling him now that I heard all

Suppose he doesnt care what you have heard said Mrs Barker sharply
Suppose he says nobody would believe you if telling is your game
Suppose he is a friend of my husband and he thinks him a much better
guardian of my reputation than a woman like you Suppose he should be
the first one to tell my husband of the foul slander invented by you

For an instant Mrs Horncastle was taken aback by the audacity of the
woman before her She knew the simple confidence and boyish trust of
Barker in his wife in spite of their sometimes strained relations and
she knew how difficult it would be to shake it And she had no idea of
betraying Mrs Barkers secret to him though she had made this scene
in his interest She had wished to save Mrs Barker from a compromising
situation even if there was a certain vindictiveness in her exposing
her to herself Yet she knew it was quite possible now if Mrs Barker
had immediate access to her husband that she would convince him of her
perfect innocence Nevertheless she had still great confidence in Van
Loos fear of scandal and his utter unmanliness She knew he was not
in love with Mrs Barker and this puzzled her when she considered the
evident risk he was running now Her face however betrayed nothing
She drew back from Mrs Barker and with an indifferent and graceful
gesture towards the door said as she leaned against the mantel Go
then and see this muchabused gentleman and then go together with him
and make peace with your husbandeven on those terms If I have saved
you from the consequences of your folly I shall be willing to bear even
HIS blame

Whatever I do said Mrs Barker rising hotly I shall not stay here
any longer to be insulted She flounced out of the room and swept down
the staircase into the office Here she found an overworked clerk and
with crimson cheeks and flashing eyes wanted to know why in her own
fathers hotel she had found her own sittingroom engaged and had been
obliged to wait half an hour before she could be shown into a decent
apartment to remove her hat and cloak in and how it was that even
the gentleman who had kindly escorted her had evidently been unable
to procure her any assistance She said this in a somewhat high voice
which might have reached the ears of that gentleman had he been in the
vicinity But he was not and she was forced to meet the somewhat dazed
apologies of the clerk alone and to accompany the chambermaid to a room
only a few paces distant from the one she had quitted Here she hastily
removed her outer duster and hat washed her hands and consulted her
excited face in the mirror with the door ajar and an ear sensitively
attuned to any step in the corridor But all this was effected so
rapidly that she was at last obliged to sit down in a chair near the
halfopened door and wait She waited five minutestenbut still no
footstep Then she went out into the corridor and listened and then
smoothing her face she slipped downstairs past the door of that
hateful room and reappeared before the clerk with a smiling but
somewhat pale and languid face She had found the room very comfortable
but it was doubtful whether she would stay over night or go on to
Hymettus Had anybody been inquiring for her She expected to meet
friends No And her escortthe gentleman who came with herwas
possibly in the billiardroom or the bar

Oh no He was gone said the clerk

Gone echoed Mrs Barker Impossible He washe was here only a
moment ago

The clerk rang a bell sharply The stableman appeared

That tall smoothfaced man in a high hat who came with the lady
said the clerk severely and conciselydidnt you tell me he was
gone

Yes sir said the stableman

Are you sure interrupted Mrs Barker with a dazzling smile that
however masked a sudden tightening round her heart

Quite sure miss said the stableman for he was in the yard when
Steptoe came after missing the coach He wanted a buggy to take him
over to the Divide We hadnt one so he went over to the other stables
and he didnt come back so I reckon hes gone I remember it because
Steptoe came by a minute after hed gone in another buggy and as he
was going to the Divide too I wondered why the gentleman hadnt gone
with him

And he left no message for me He said nothing asked Mrs Barker
quite breathless but still smiling

He said nothin to me but Isnt that Steptoe over there when Steptoe
came in And I remember he said it kinder suddentas if he was reminded
o suthin hed forgot and then he asked for a buggy Ye see
miss added the man with a certain rough consideration for her
disappointment thats mebbe why he clean forgot to leave a message

Mrs Barker turned away and ascended the stairs Selfishness is quick
to recognize selfishness and she saw in a flash the reason of Van Loos
abandonment of her Some fear of discovery had alarmed him perhaps
Steptoe knew her husband perhaps he had heard of Mrs Horncastles
possession of the sittingroom perhapsfor she had not seen him since
their playful struggle at the doorhe had recognized the woman who was
there and the selfish coward had run away Yes Mrs Horncastle was
right she had been only a miserable dupe

Her cheeks blazed as she entered the room she had just quitted
and threw herself in a chair by the window She bit her lip as she
remembered how for the last three months she had been slowly yielding
to Van Loos cautious but insinuating solicitation from a flirtation in
the San Francisco hotel to a clandestine meeting in the street from a
ride in the suburbs to a supper in a fast restaurant after the theatre
Other women did it who were fashionable and rich as Van Loo had pointed
out to her Other fashionable women also gambled in stocks and had
their private broker in a Charley or a Jack Why should not Mrs
Barker have business with a Paul Van Loo particularly as this fast
craze permitted secret meetingsfor business of this kind could not be
conducted in public and permitted the fair gambler to call at private
offices without fear and without reproach Mrs Barkers vanity Mrs
Barkers love of ceremony and form Mrs Barkers snobbishness were
flattered by the attentions of this polished gentleman with a foreign
name which even had the flavor of nobility who never picked up her fan
and handed it to her without bowing and always rose when she entered
the room Mrs Barkers scant schoolgirl knowledge was touched by this
gentleman who spoke French fluently and delicately explained to her
the libretto of a risky opera bouffe And now she had finally yielded
to a meeting out of San Franciscoand an ostensible visitstill as a
speculatorto one or two mining districtswith HER BROKER This
was the boldest of her stepsan original idea of the fashionable Van
Loowhich no doubt in time would become a craze too But it was a
long stepand there was a streak of rustic decorum in Mrs Barkers
naturethe instinct that made Kitty Carter keep a perfectly secluded
and distinct sittingroom in the days when she served her fathers
gueststhat now had impelled her to make it a proviso that the first
step of her journey should be from her old home in her fathers hotel
It was this instinct of the proprieties that had revived in her suddenly
at the door of the old sittingroom

Then a new phase of the situation flashed upon her It was hard for her
vanity to accept Van Loos desertion as voluntary and final What if
that hateful woman had lured him away by some trick or artfully designed
message She was capable of such meanness to insure the fulfillment of
her prophecy Or more dreadful thought what if she had some hold on
his affectionsshe had said that he had pursued her or more infamous
still there were some secret understanding between them and that
sheMrs Barkerwas the dupe of them both What was she doing in the
hotel at such a moment What was her story of going to Hymettus but a
lie as transparent as her own The tortures of jealousy which is as
often the incentive as it is the result of passion began to rack her
She had probably yet known no real passion for this man but with the
thought of his abandoning her and the conception of his faithlessness
came the wish to hold and keep him that was dangerously near it What
if he were even then in that room the room where she had said she would
not stay to be insulted and they thus secured against her intrusion
were laughing at her now She half rose at the thought but a sound of
a horses hoofs in the stableyard arrested her She ran to the window
which gave upon it and crouching down beside it listened eagerly The
clatter of hoofs ceased the stableman was talking to some one
suddenly she heard the stableman say Mrs Barker is here Her heart
leapedVan Loo had returned

But here the voice of the other man which she had not yet heard arose
for the first time clear and distinct Are you quite sure I didnt
know she left San Francisco

The room reeled around her The voice was George Barkers her husband
Very well he continued You neednt put up my horse for the night I
may take her back a little later in the buggy

In another moment she had swept down the passage and burst into the
other room Mrs Horncastle was sitting by the table with a book in her
hand She started as the halfmaddened woman closed the door locked it
behind her and cast herself on her knees at her feet

My husband is here she gasped What shall I do In heavens name
help me

Is Van Loo still here said Mrs Horncastle quickly

No gone He went when I came

Mrs Horncastle caught her hand and looked intently into her frightened
face Then what have you to fear from your husband she said abruptly

You dont understand He didnt know I was here He thought me in San
Francisco

Does he know it now

Yes I heard the stableman tell him Couldnt you say I came here with
you that we were here together that it was just a little freak of
ours Oh do

Mrs Horncastle thought a moment Yes she said well see him here
together

Oh no no said Mrs Barker suddenly clinging to her dress and
looking fearfully towards the door I couldnt COULDNT see him now
Say Im sick tired out gone to my room

But youll have to see him later said Mrs Horncastle wonderingly

Yes but he may go first I heard him tell them not to put up his
horse

Good said Mrs Horncastle suddenly Go to your room and lock the
door and Ill come to you later Stop Would Mr Barker be likely to
disturb you if I told him you would like to be alone

No he never does I often tell him that

Mrs Horncastle smiled faintly Come quick then she said for he
may come HERE first

Opening the door she passed into the halfdark and empty hall Now
run She heard the quick rustle of Mrs Barkers skirt die away in the
distance the opening and shutting of a doorsilenceand then turned
back into her own room

She was none too soon Presently she heard Barkers voice saying Thank
you I can find the way his still buoyant step on the staircase and
then saw his brown curls rising above the railing The light streaming
through the open door of the sitting room into the halflit hall had
partially dazzled him and already bewildered he was still more
dazzled at the unexpected apparition of the smiling face and bright eyes
of Mrs Horncastle standing in the doorway

You have fairly caught us she said with charming composure but I
had half a mind to let you wander round the hotel a little longer Come
in Barker followed her in mechanically and she closed the door Now
sit down she said gayly and tell me how you knew we were here and
what you mean by surprising us at this hour

Barkers ready color always rose on meeting Mrs Horncastle for whom
he entertained a respectful admiration not without some fear of her
worldly superiority He flushed bowed and stared somewhat blankly
around the room at the familiar walls at the chair from which Mrs
Horncastle had just risen and finally at his wifes glove which Mrs
Horncastle had a moment before ostentatiously thrown on the table
Seeing which she pounced upon it with assumed archness and pretended to
conceal it

I had no idea my wife was here he said at last and I was quite
surprised when the man told me for she had not written to me about it
As his face was brightening she for the first time noticed that his
frank gray eyes had an abstracted look and there was a faint line of
contraction on his youthful forehead Still less he added did I
look for the pleasure of meeting you For I only came here to inquire
about my old partner Demorest who arrived from Europe a few days ago
and who should have reached Hymettus early this afternoon But now I
hear he came all the way by coach instead of by rail and got off at the
crossroad and we must have passed each other on the different trails
So my journey would have gone for nothing only that I now shall have
the pleasure of going back with you and Kitty It will be a lovely drive
by moonlight

Relieved by this revelation it was easy work for Mrs Horncastle to
launch out into a playful tantalizing wittybut I grieve to say
entirely imaginativeaccount of her escapade with Mrs Barker How
left alone at the San Francisco hotel while their gentlemen friends
were enjoying themselves at Hymettus they resolved upon a little trip
partly for the purpose of looking into some small investments of their
own and partly for the fun of the thing What funny experiences they
had How in particular one horrid inquisitive vulgar wretch had been
boring a European fellow passenger who was going to Hymettus finally
asking him where he had come from last and when he answered Hymettus
thought the man was insulting him

But interrupted the laughing Barker that passenger may have been
Demorest who has just come from Greece and surely Kitty would have
recognized him

Mrs Horncastle instantly saw her blunder and not only retrieved it
but turned it to account Ah yes but by that time poor Kitty unused
to long journeys and the heat was utterly fagged out was asleep and
perfectly unrecognizable in veils and dusters on the back seat of the
coach And this brought her to the pointwhich was that she was sorry
to say on arriving the poor child was nearly wild with a headache from
fatigue and had gone to bed and she had promised not to disturb her

The undisguised amusement mingled with relief that had overspread
Barkers face during this lively recital might have pricked the
conscience of Mrs Horncastle but for some reason I fear it did not
But it emboldened her to go on I said I promised her that I would see
she wasnt disturbed but of course now that YOU her HUSBAND have
come if

Not for worlds interrupted Barker earnestly I know poor Kittys
headaches and I never disturb her poor child except when Im
thoughtless And here one of the most thoughtful men in the world in
his sensitive consideration of others beamed at her with such frank
and wonderful eyes that the arch hypocrite before him with difficulty
suppressed a hysterical desire to laugh and felt the conscious blood
flush her to the root of her hair You know he went on with a sigh
half of relief and half of reminiscence that I often think Im a great
bother to a clearheaded sensible girl like Kitty She knows people so
much better than I do Shes wonderfully equipped for the world and
you see Im only lucky as everybody says and I dare say part of
my luck was to have got her Im very glad shes a friend of yours you
know for somehow I fancied always that you were not interested in her
or that you didnt understand each other until now Its odd that nice
women dont always like nice women isnt it Im glad she was with you
I was quite startled to learn she was here and couldnt make it out I
thought at first she might have got anxious about our little Sta who
is with me and the nurse at Hymettus But Im glad it was only a lark I
shouldnt wonder he added with a laugh although she always declares
she isnt one of those doting idiotic mothers that she found it a
little dull without the boy for all she thought it was better for ME to
take him somewhere for a change of air

The situation was becoming more difficult for Mrs Horncastle than she
had conceived There had been a certain excitement in its first direct
appeal to her tact and courage and even she believed an unselfish
desire to save the relations between husband and wife if she could But
she had not calculated upon his unconscious revelations nor upon their
effect upon herself She had concluded to believe that Kitty had in a
moment of folly lent herself to this harebrained escapade but it now
might be possible that it had been deliberately planned Kitty had sent
her husband and child away three weeks before Had she told the whole
truth How long had this been going on And if the soulless Van Loo
had deserted her now was it not perhaps the miserable ending of an
intrigue rather than its beginning Had she been as great a dupe of this
woman as the husband before her A new and double consciousness came
over her that for a moment prevented her from meeting his honest eyes
She felt the shame of being an accomplice mingled with a fierce joy at
the idea of a climax that might separate him from his wife forever

Luckily he did not notice it but with a continued sense of relief threw
himself back in his chair and glancing familiarly round the walls broke
into his youthful laugh Lord how I remember this room in the old
days It was Kittys own private sittingroom you know and I used to
think it looked just as fresh and pretty as she I used to think her
crayon drawing wonderful and still more wonderful that she should have
that unnecessary talent when it was quite enough for her to be just
Kitty You know dont you how you feel at those times when youre
quite happy in being inferiorHe stopped a moment with a sudden
recollection that Mrs Horncastles marriage had been notoriously
unhappy I mean he went on with a shy little laugh and an innocent
attempt at gallantry which the very directness of his simple nature made
atrociously obviousI mean what youve made lots of young fellows
feel There used to be a picture of Colonel Brigg on the mantelpiece in
full uniform and signed by himself for Kitty and Lord how jealous I
was of it for Kitty never took presents from gentlemen and nobody even
was allowed in here though she helped her father all over the
hotel She was awfully strict in those days he interpolated with
a thoughtful look and a halfsigh but then she wasnt married I
proposed to her in this very room Lord I remember how frightened I
was He stopped for an instant and then said with a certain timidity
Do you mind my telling you something about it

Mrs Horncastle was hardly prepared to hear these ingenuous domestic
details but she smiled vaguely although she could not suppress a
somewhat impatient movement with her hands Even Barker noticed it but
to her surprise moved a little nearer to her and in a halfentreating
way said I hope I dont bore you but its something confidential Do
you know that she first REFUSED me

Mrs Horncastle smiled but could not resist a slight toss of her head
I believe they all do when they are sure of a man

No said Barker eagerly you dont understand I proposed to her
because I thought I was rich In a foolish moment I thought I had
discovered that some old stocks I had had acquired a fabulous value She
believed it too but because she thought I was now a rich man and she
only a poor girla mere servant to her fathers guestsshe refused me
Refused me because she thought I might regret it in the future because
she would not have it said that she had taken advantage of my proposal
only when I was rich enough to make it

Well said Mrs Horncastle incredulously gazing straight before her
and then

In about an hour I discovered my error that my stocks were worthless
that I was still a poor man I thought it only honest to return to her
and tell her even though I had no hope And then she pitied me and
cried and accepted me I tell it to you as her friend He drew a
little nearer and quite fraternally laid his hand upon her own I know
you wont betray me though you may think it wrong for me to have told
it but I wanted you to know how good she was and true

For a moment Mrs Horncastle was amazed and discomfited although she
saw with the inscrutable instinct of her sex no inconsistency between
the Kitty of those days and the Kitty now shamefully hiding from her
husband in the same hotel No doubt Kitty had some good reason for her
chivalrous act But she could see the unmistakable effect of that act
upon the more logically reasoning husband and that it might lead him to
be more merciful to the later wrong And there was a keener irony that
his first movement of unconscious kindliness towards her was the outcome
of his affection for his undeserving wife

You said just now she was more practical than you she said dryly
Apart from this evidence of it what other reasons have you for
thinking so Do you refer to her independence or her dealings in the
stock market she added with a laugh

No said Barker seriously for I do not think her quite practical
there indeed Im afraid she is about as bad as I am But Im glad you
have spoken for I can now talk confidentially with you and as you
and she are both in the same ventures perhaps she will feel less
compunction in hearing from youas your own opinionwhat I have
to tell you than if I spoke to her myself I am afraid she trusts
implicitly to Van Loos judgment as her broker I believe he is strictly
honorable but the general opinion of his business insight is not high
Theyperhaps I ought to say HEhave been at least so unlucky that
they might have learned prudence The loss of twenty thousand dollars in
three months

Twenty thousand echoed Mrs Horncastle

Yes Why you knew that it was in the mine you and she visited or
perhaps he added hastily as he flushed at his indiscretion she
didnt tell you that

But Mrs Horncastle as hastily said Yesyesof course only I had
forgotten the amount and he continued

That loss would have frightened any man but you women are more daring
Only Van Loo ought to have withdrawn Dont you think so Of course I
couldnt say anything to him without seeming to condemn my own wife I
couldnt say anything to HER because its her own money

I didnt know that Mrs Barker had any money of her own said Mrs
Horncastle

Well I gave it to her said Barker with sublime simplicity and
that would make it all the worse for me to speak about it

Mrs Horncastle was silent A new theory flashed upon her which seemed
to reconcile all the previous inconsistencies of the situation Van
Loo under the guise of a lover was really possessing himself of Mrs
Barkers money This accounted for the risks he was running in this
escapade which were so incongruous to the rascals nature He was
calculating that the scandal of an intrigue would relieve him of
the perils of criminal defalcation It was compatible with Kittys
innocence though it did not relieve her vanity of the part it played in
this despicable comedy of passion All that Mrs Horncastle thought of
now was the effect of its eventful revelation upon the man before
her Of course he would overlook his wifes trustfulness and business
ignoranceit would seem so like his own unselfish faith That was the
fault of all unselfish goodness it even took the color of adjacent
evil without altering the nature of either Mrs Horncastle set her
teeth tightly together but her beautiful mouth smiled upon Barker
though her eyes were bent upon the tablecloth before her

I shall do all I can to impress your views upon her she said at last
though I fear they will have little weight if given as my own And you
overrate my general influence with her

Her handsome head drooped in such a thoughtful humility that Barker
instinctively drew nearer to her Besides she had not lifted her dark
lashes for some moments and he had the still youthful habit of looking
frankly into the eyes of those he addressed

No he said eagerly how could I She could not help but love you
and do as you would wish I cant tell you how glad and relieved I am
to find that you and she have become such friends You know I always
thought you beautiful I always thought you so cleverI was even a
little frightened of you but I never until now knew you were so GOOD
No stop Yes I DID know it Do you remember once in San Francisco
when I found you with Sta in your lap in the drawingroom I knew it
then You tried to make me think it was a whimthe fancy of a bored
and worried woman But I knew better And I knew what you were thinking
then Shall I tell you

As her eyes were still cast down although her mouth was still smiling
in his endeavors to look into them his face was quite near hers He
fancied that it bore the look she had worn once before

You were thinking he said in a voice which had grown suddenly quite
hesitating and tremuloushe did not know whythat the poor little
baby was quite friendless and alone You were pitying ityou know you
werebecause there was no one to give it the loving care that was its
due and because it was intrusted to that hired nurse in that great
hotel You were thinking how you would love it if it were yours and how
cruel it was that Love was sent without an object to waste itself upon
You were I saw it in your face

She suddenly lifted her eyes and looked full into his with a look that
held and possessed him For a moment his whole soul seemed to tremble
on the verge of their lustrous depths and he drew back dizzy and
frightened What he saw there he never clearly knew but whatever it
was it seemed to suddenly change his relations to her to the room to
his wife to the world without It was a glimpse of a world of which
he knew nothing He had looked frankly and admiringly into the eyes of
other pretty women he had even gazed into her own before but never
with this feeling A sudden sense that what he had seen there he had
himself evoked that it was an answer to some question he had scarcely
yet formulated and that they were both now linked by an understanding
and consciousness that was irretrievable came over him He rose
awkwardly and went to the window She rose also but more leisurely and
easily moved one of the books on the table smoothed out her skirts
and changed her seat to a little sofa It is the woman who always comes
out of these crucial moments unruffled

I suppose you will be glad to see your friend Mr Demorest when you
go back she said pleasantly for of course he will be at Hymettus
awaiting you

He turned eagerly as he always did at the name But even then he felt
that Demorest was no longer of such importance to him He felt too
that he was not yet quite sure of his voice or even what to say As he
hesitated she went on half playfully It seems hard that you had to
come all the way here on such a bootless errand You havent even seen
your wife yet

The mention of his wife recalled him to himself oddly enough when
Demorests name had failed But very differently Out of his whirling
consciousness came the instinctive feeling that he could not see her
now He turned crossed the room sat down on the sofa beside Mrs
Horncastle and without however looking at her said with his eyes on
the floor No and Ive been thinking that its hardly worth while to
disturb her so early tomorrow as I should have to go So I think its
a good deal better to let her have a good nights rest remain here
quietly with you tomorrow until the stage leaves and that both of you
come over together My horse is still saddled and I will be back at
Hymettus before Demorest has gone to bed

He was obliged to look up at her as he rose Mrs Horncastle was sitting
erect beautiful and dazzling as even he had never seen her before
For his resolution had suddenly lifted a great weight from her
shouldersthe dangerous meeting of husband and wife the next morning
and its results whatever they might be had been quietly averted She
felt too a halffrightened joy even in the constrained manner in which
he had imparted his determination That frankness which even she had
sometimes found so crushing was gone

I really think you are quite right she said rising also and
besides you see it will give me a chance to talk to her as you
wished

To talk to her as I wished echoed Barker abstractedly

Yes about Van Loo you know said Mrs Horncastle smiling

Oh certainlyabout Van Loo of course he returned hurriedly

And then said Mrs Horncastle brightly Ill tell her Stay she
interrupted herself hurriedly Why need I say anything about your
having been here AT ALL It might only annoy her as you yourself
suggest She stopped breathlessly with parted lips

Why indeed said Barker vaguely Yet all this was so unlike his usual
truthfulness that he slightly hesitated

Besides continued Mrs Horncastle noticing it you know you can
always tell her later if necessary And she added with a charming
mischievousness As she didnt tell you she was coming I really dont
see why you are bound to tell her that you were here

The sophistry pleased Barker even though it put him into a certain
retaliating attitude towards his wife which he was not aware of feeling
But as Mrs Horncastle put it it was only a playful attitude

Certainly he said Dont say anything about it

He moved to the door with his soft broadbrimmed hat swinging between
his fingers She noticed for the first time that he looked taller in his
long black serape and ridingboots and oddly enough much more like
the hero of an amorous tryst than Van Loo I know she said brightly
you are eager to get back to your old friend and it would be selfish
for me to try to keep you longer You have had a stupid evening but you
have made it pleasant to me by telling me what you thought of me And
before you go I want you to believe that I shall try to keep that good
opinion She spoke frankly in contrast to the slight worldly constraint
of Barkers manner it seemed as if they had changed characters And
then she extended her hand

With a low bow and without looking up he took it Again their
pulses seemed to leap together with one accord and the same mysterious
understanding He could not tell if he had unconsciously pressed her
hand or if she had returned the pressure But when their hands unclasped
it seemed as if it were the division of one flesh and spirit

She remained standing by the open door until his footsteps passed down
the staircase Then she suddenly closed and locked the door with an
instinct that Mrs Barker might at once return now that he was gone and
she wished to be a moment alone to recover herself But she presently
opened it again and listened There was a noise in the courtyard but it
sounded like the rattle of wheels more than the clatter of a horseman
Then she was overcomea sudden sense of pity for the unfortunate
woman still hiding from her husbandand felt a momentary chivalrous
exaltation of spirit Certainly she had done good to that wretched
Kitty perhaps she had earned the epithet that Barker had applied to
her Perhaps that was the meaning of all this happiness to her and the
result was to be only the happiness and reconciliation of the wife and
husband This was to be her reward I grieve to say that the tears had
come into her beautiful eyes at this satisfactory conclusion but she
dashed them away and ran out into the hall It was quite dark but there
was a faint glimmer on the opposite wall as if the door of Mrs Barkers
bedroom were ajar to an eager listener She flew towards the glimmer
and pushed the door open the room was empty Empty of Mrs Barker
empty of her dressingbox her reticule and shawl She was gone

Still Mrs Horncastle lingered the woman might have got frightened and
retreated to some further room at the opening of the door and the coming
out of her husband She walked along the passage calling her name
softly She even penetrated the dreary halflit public parlor
expecting to find her crouching there Then a sudden wild idea took
possession of her the miserable wife had repented of her act and of
her concealment and had crept downstairs to await her husband in the
office She had told him some new lie had begged him to take her with
him and Barker of course had assented Yes she now knew why she
had heard the rattling wheels instead of the clattering hoofs she had
listened for They had gone together as he first proposed in the
buggy

She ran swiftly down the stairs and entered the office The overworked
clerk was busy and querulously curt These women were always asking such
idiotic questions Yes Mr Barker had just gone

With Mrs Barker in the buggy asked Mrs Horncastle

No as he cameon horseback Mrs Barker left HALF AN HOUR AGO

Alone

This was apparently too much for the longsuffering clerk He lifted
his eyes to the ceiling and then with painful precision and accenting
every word with his pencil on the desk before him said deliberately
Mrs George Barkerleftherewith herescorttheman
shewasalwaysaskingforinthebuggyat exactly935 And he
plunged into his work again

Mrs Horncastle turned ran up the staircase reentered the
sittingroom and slamming the door behind her halted in the centre of
the room panting erect beautiful and menacing And she was alone in
this empty roomthis deserted hotel From this very room her husband
had left her with a brutality on his lips From this room the fool
and liar she had tried to warn had gone to her ruin with a swindling
hypocrite And from this room the only man in the world she ever cared
for had gone forth bewildered wronged and abused and she knew now she
could have kept and comforted him




CHAPTER IV


When Philip Demorest left the stagecoach at the crossroads he turned
into the only wayside house the blacksmiths shop and declaring his
intention of walking over to Hymettus asked permission to leave his
handbag and wraps until they could be sent after him The blacksmith
was surprised that this likely mannered distinguishedlooking city
man should WALK eight miles when he could ride and tried to dissuade
him offering his own buggy But he was still more surprised when
Demorest laying aside his duster took off his coat and slinging it
on his arm prepared to set forth with the goodhumored assurance that
he would do the distance in a couple of hours and get in in time for
supper I wouldnt be too sure of that said the blacksmith grimly
or even of getting a room Theyre a stuckup lot over there and they
aint goin to hump themselves over a chap who comes traipsin along
the road like any tramp with nary baggage But Demorest laughingly
accepted the risk and taking his stout stick in one hand pressed a
gold coin into the blacksmiths palm which was however declined
with such reddening promptness that Demorest as promptly reddened and
apologized The habits of European travel had been still strong on him
and he felt a slight patriotic thrill as he said with a grave smile
Thank you then and thank you still more for reminding me that I am
among my own people and stepped lightly out into the road

The air was still deliciously cool but warmer currents from the heated
pines began to alternate with the wind from the summit He found himself
sometimes walking through a stratum of hot air which seemed to exhale
from the wood itself while his head and breast were swept by the
mountain breeze He felt the old intoxication of the balmyscented
air again and the five years of care and hopelessness laid upon his
shoulders since he had last breathed its fragrance slipped from them
like a burden There had been but little change here perhaps the road
was wider and the dust lay thicker but the great pines still mounted
in serried ranks on the slopes as before with no gaps in their unending
files Here was the spot where the stagecoach had passed them that
eventful morning when they were coming out of their camplife into the
world of civilization a little further back the spot where Jack Hamlin
had forced upon him that grim memento of the attempted robbery of
their cabin which he had kept ever since He half smiled again at the
superstitious interest that had made him keep it with the intention of
some day returning to bury it with all recollections of the deed under
the site of the old cabin As he went on in the vivifying influence of
the air and scene new life seemed to course through his veins his step
seemed to grow as elastic as in the old days of their bitter but hopeful
struggle for fortune when he had gayly returned from his weekly tramp
to Boomville laden with the scant provision procured by their scant
earnings and dying credit Those were the days when HER living image
still inspired his heart with faith and hope when everything was yet
possible to youth and love and before the irony of fate had given
him fortune with one hand only to withdraw HER with the other It
was strange and cruel that coming back from his quest of rest and
forgetfulness he should find only these youthful and sanguine dreams
revive with his reviving vigor He walked on more hurriedly as if to
escape them and was glad to be diverted by one or two carryalls and
charabancs filled with gayly dressed pleasure partiesevidently
visitors to Hymettuswhich passed him on the road Here were the first
signs of change He recalled the train of packmules of the old days
the file of poleandbasket carrying Chinese the squaw with the papoose
strapped to her shoulder or the wandering and footsore prospector who
were the only wayfarers he used to meet He contrasted their halts and
friendly greetings with the insolent curiosity or undisguised contempt
of the carriage folk and smiled as he thought of the warning of the
blacksmith But this did not long divert him he found himself again
returning to his previous thought Indeed the face of a young girl in
one of the carriages had quite startled him with its resemblance to an
old memory of his lost love as he saw herher frail pale elegance
encompassed in laces as she leaned back in her drive through Fifth
Avenue with eyes that lit up and became transfigured only as he
passed He tried to think of his useless quest in search of her last
restingplace abroad how he had been baffled by the opposition of her
surviving relations already incensed by the thought that her decline
had been the effect of her hopeless passion He tried to recall the few
frigid lines that reconveyed to him the last letter he had sent her
with the announcement of her death and the hope that his persecutions
would now cease A wild idea had sometimes come to him out of the very
insufficiency of his knowledge of this climax but he had always put
it aside as a precursor of that madness which might end his ceaseless
thought And now it was returning to him here thousands of miles away
from where she was peacefully sleeping and even filling him with the
vigor of youthful hope

The brief mountain twilight was giving way now to the radiance of the
rising moon He endeavored to fix his thoughts upon his partners who
were to meet him at Hymettus after these long years of separation

Hymettus He recalled now the odd coincidence that he had mischievously
used as a gag to his questioning fellow traveler but now he had really
come from a villa near Athens to find his old house thus classically
rechristened after it and thought of it with a gravity he had not felt
before He wondered who had named it There was no suggestion of the
soft sensuous elegance of the land he had left in those great heroics
of nature before him Those enormous trees were no woods for fauns or
dryads they had their own godlike majesty of bulk and height and as he
at last climbed the summit and saw the darkhelmeted head of Black Spur
before him and beyond it the pallid spiritual cloud of the Sierras he
did not think of Olympus Yet for a moment he was startled as he turned
to the right by the Doriccolumned facade of a temple painted by the
moonbeams and framed in an opening of the dark woods before him It
was not until he had reached it that he saw that it was the new wooden
postoffice of Heavy Tree Hill

And now the buildings of the new settlement began to faintly appear But
the obscurity of the shadow and the equally disturbing unreality of the
moonlight confused him in his attempts to recognize the old landmarks
A broad and wellkept winding road had taken the place of the old
steep but direct trail to his cabin He had walked for some moments in
uncertainty when a sudden sweep of the road brought the full crest
of the hill above and before him crowned with a tiara of lights
overtopping a long base of flashing windows That was all that was left
of Heavy Tree Hill The old foreground of buckeye and odorous ceanothus
was gone Even the great grove of pines behind it had vanished

There was already a stir of life in the road and he could see figures
moving slowly along a kind of sterile formal terrace spread with a few
dreary marble vases and plaster statues which had replaced the natural
slope and the great quartz buttresses of outcrop that supported it
Presently he entered a gate and soon found himself in the carriage
drive leading to the hotel veranda A number of fair promenaders were
facing the keen mountain night wind in wraps and furs Demorest had
replaced his coat but his boots were red with dust and as he ascended
the steps he could see that he was eyed with some superciliousness by
the guests and with considerable suspicion by the servants One of the
latter was approaching him with an insolent smile when a figure darted
from the vestibule and brushing the waiter aside seized Demorests
two hands in his and held him at arms length

Demorest old man

Stacy old chap

But wheres your team Ive had all the spare hostlers and hallboys
listening for you at the gate And wheres Barker When he found youd
given the deadcut to the railroadHIS railroad you knowhe loped
over to Boomville after you

Demorest briefly explained that he had walked by the old road and
probably missed him But by this time the waiters crushed by the
spectacle of this travelworn strangers affectionate reception by
the great financial magnate were wildly applying their brushes and
handkerchiefs to his trousers and boots until Stacy again swept them
away

Get off all of you Now Phil you come with me The house is full
but Ive made the manager give you a ladys drawingroom suite When you
telegraphed youd meet us HERE there was no chance to get anything else
Its really Mrs Van Loos family suite but they were sent for to go to
Marysville yesterday and so well run you in for the night

Butprotested Demorest

Nonsense said Stacy dragging him away Well pay for it and I
reckon the old lady wont object to taking her share of the damage
either or she isnt Van Loos mother Come

Demorest felt himself hurried forward by the energetic Stacy preceded
by the obsequious manager through a corridor to a handsomely furnished
suite into whose bathroom Stacy incontinently thrust him

There Wash up and by the time youre ready Barker ought to be back
and well have supper Its waiting for us in the other room

But how about Barker the dear boy persisted Demorest holding open
the door Tell me is he well and happy

About as well as we all are said Stacy quickly yet with a certain
dry significance Never mind now wait until you see him

The door closed When Demorest had finished washing and wiped away the
last red stain of the mountain road he found Stacy seated by the window
of the larger sittingroom In the centre a table was spread for supper
A bright fire of hickory logs burnt on a marble hearth between two
large windows that gave upon the distant outline of Black Spur As Stacy
turned towards him by the light of the shaded lamp and flickering fire
Demorest had a good look at the face of his old friend and partner It
was as keen and energetic as ever with perhaps an even more hawklike
activity visible in the eye and nostril but it was more thoughtful and
reticent in the lines of the mouth under the closely clipped beard and
mustache and when he looked up at first there were two deep lines or
furrows across his low broad forehead Demorest fancied too that
there was a little of the old fighting look in his eye but it softened
quickly as his friend approached and he burst out with his curt but
honest singlesyllabled laugh Ha You look a little less like a roving
Apache than you did when you came I really thought the waiters were
going to chuck you And you ARE tanned Darned if you dont look like
the profile stamped on a Continental penny But heres luck and a
welcome back old man

Demorest passed his arm around the neck of his seated partner and
grasping his upraised hand said looking down with a smile And now
about Barker

Oh Parker dn him Hes the same unshakable unchangeable
ungrowupable Barker With the devils own luck too Waltzing into
risks and waltzing out of em With fads enough to put him in the insane
asylum if people did not prefer to keep him out of it to help
em Always believing in everybody until they actually believe in
themselves and shake him And hes got a wife thats making a fool of
herself and I shouldnt wonder in timeof him

Demorest pressed his hand over his partners mouth Come Jim You know
you never really liked that marriage simply because you thought that
old man Carter made a good thing of it And you never seem to have taken
into consideration the happiness Barker got out of it for he DID love
the girl And he still is happy is he not he added quickly as Stacy
uttered a grunt

As happy as a man can be who has his child here with a nurse while his
wife is gallivanting in San Francisco and throwing her moneyand
Lord knows what elseaway at the bidding of a smoothtongued shady
operator

Does HE complain of it asked Demorest

Not he the fool trusts her said Stacy curtly

Demorest laughed That is happiness Come Jim dont let us begrudge
him that But Ive heard that his affairs have again prospered

He built this railroad and this hotel The bank owns both now He
didnt care to keep money in them after they were a success said he
wasnt an engineer nor a hotelkeeper and drew it out to find something
new But here he comes he added as a horseman dashed into the drive
before the hotel Question him yourself You know you and he always get
along best without me

In another moment Barker had burst into the room and in his first
tempestuous greeting of Demorest the latter saw little change in his
younger partner as he held him at arms length to look at him Why
Barker boy you havent got a bit older since the day whenyou
rememberyou went over to Boomville to cash your bonds and then came
back and burst upon us like this to tell us you were a beggar

Yes laughed Barker and all the while you fellows were holding four
aces up your sleeve in the shape of the big strike

And you Georgy old boy returned Demorest swinging Barkers two
hands backwards and forwards were holding a royal flush up yours in
the shape of your engagement to Kitty

The fresh color died out of Barkers cheek even while the frank laugh
was still on his mouth He turned his face for a moment towards the
window and a swift and almost involuntary glance passed between the
others But he almost as quickly turned his glistening eyes back to
Demorest again and said eagerly Yes dear Kitty You shall see her
and the baby tomorrow

Then they fell upon the supper with the appetites of the Past and for
some moments they all talked eagerly and even noisily together all at
the same time with even the spirits of the Past They recalled every
detail of their old life eagerly and impetuously recounted the old
struggles hopes and disappointments gave the strange importance of
schoolboys to unimportant events and a mystic meaning to a shibboleth
of their own roared over old jokes with a delight they had never since
given to new reawakened idiotic nicknames and bywords with intense
enjoyment grew grave anxious and agonized over forgotten names
trifling dates useless distances ineffective records and feeble
chronicles of their domestic economy It was the thoughtful and
melancholy Demorest who remembered the exact color and price paid for
a certain shirt bought from a Greaser peddler amidst the envy of his
companions it was the financial magnate Stacy who could inform them
what were the exact days they had saleratus bread and when flapjacks
it was the thoughtless and mercurial Barker who recalled with unheardof
accuracy amidst the applause of the others the full name of the
Indian squaw who assisted at their washing Even then they were almost
feverishly loath to leave the subject as if the Past at least was
secure to them still and they were even doubtful of their own free and
full accord in the Present Then they slipped rather reluctantly
into their later experiences but with scarcely the same freedom or
spontaneity and it was noticeable that these records were elicited from
Barker by Stacy or from Stacy by Barker for the information of Demorest
often with chaffing and only under goodhumored protest Tell Demorest
how you broke the Copper Ring from the admiring Barker or Tell
Demorest how your dd foolishness in buying up the right and plant of
the Ditch Company got you control of the railroad from the mischievous
Stacy were challenges in point Presently they left the table and to
the astonishment of the waiters who removed the cloth common brierwood
pipes thoughtfully provided by Barker in commemoration of the Past
were lit and they ranged themselves in armchairs before the fire quite
unconsciously in their old attitudes The two windows on either side of
the hearth gave them the same view that the open door of the old cabin
had made familiar to them the leaguelong valley below the shadowy bulk
of the Black Spur rising in the distance and still more remote the
pallid snowline that soared even beyond its crest

As in the old time they were for many moments silent and then as in
the old time it was the irrepressible Barker who broke the silence
But Stacy does not tell you anything about his friend the beautiful
Mrs Horncastle You know hes the guardian of one of the finest women
in Californiaa woman as noble and generous as she is handsome And
think of it Hes protecting her from her brute of a husband and
looking after her property Isnt it good and chivalrous of him

The irrepressible laughter of the two men brought only wonder and
reproachful indignation into the widely opened eyes of Barker HE was
perfectly sincere He had been thinking of Stacys admiration for
Mrs Horncastle in his ride from Boomville and strange to say yet
characteristic of his nature it was equally the natural outcome of his
interview with her and the singular effect she had upon him That he
Barker thoroughly sympathized with her only convinced him that Stacy
must feel the same for her and that no doubt she must respond to him
equally And how noble it was in his old partner with his advantages of
position in the world and his protecting relations to her not to avail
himself of this influence upon her generous nature If he himselfa
married man and the husband of Kittywas so conscious of her charm how
much greater it must be to the free and INEXPERIENCED Stacy

The italics were in Barkers thought for in those matters he felt
that Stacy and even Demorest occupied in other things had not his
knowledge There was no idea or consciousness of heroically sacrificing
himself or Mrs Horncastle in this I am afraid there was not even an
idea of a superior morality in himself in giving up the possibility
of loving her Ever since Stacy had first seen her he had fancied that
Stacy liked herindeed Kitty fancied it tooand it seemed almost
providential now that he should know how to assist his old partner to
happiness For it was inconceivable that Stacy should not be able
to rescue this woman from her shameful bonds or that she should not
consent to it through his Barkers arguments and entreaties To a
champion of dames this seemed only right and proper In his unfailing
optimism he translated Stacys laugh as embarrassment and Demorests as
only ignorance of the real question But Demorest had noticed if he had
not that Stacys laugh was a little nervously prolonged for a man of
his temperament and that he had cast a very keen glance at Barker A
messenger arriving with a telegram brought from Boomville called Stacy
momentarily away and Barker was not slow to take advantage of his
absence

I wish Phil he said hitching his chair closer to Demorest
that you would think seriously of this matter and try to persuade
Stacywho I believe is more interested in Mrs Horncastle than he
cares to showto put a little of that determination in love that he has
shown in business Shes an awfully fine woman and in every way suited
to him and he is letting an absurd sense of pride and honor keep him
from influencing her to get rid of her impossible husband Theres no
reason continued Barker in a burst of enthusiastic simplicity that
BECAUSE she has found some one she likes better and who would treat
her better that she should continue to stick to that beast whom all
California would gladly see her divorced from I never could understand
that kind of argument could you

Demorest looked at his companions glowing cheek and kindling eye with
a smile A good deal depends upon the side from which you argue But
frankly Barker boy though I think I know you in all your phases I am
not prepared yet to accept you as a matchmaker However Ill think it
over and find out something more of this from your goddess who seems
to have bewitched you both But what does Mistress Kitty say to your
admiration

Barkers face clouded but instantly brightened Oh theyre the best
of friends theyre quite like us you know even to larks they have
together He stopped and colored at his slip But Demorest who had
noticed his change of expression was more concerned at the look of half
incredulity and half suspicion with which Stacy who had reentered
the room in time to hear Barkers speech was regarding his unconscious
younger partner

I didnt know that Mrs Horncastle and Mrs Barker were such friends
he said dryly as he sat down again But his face presently became so
abstracted that Demorest said gayly

Well Jim Im glad Im not a Napoleon of Finance I couldnt stand
it to have my privacy or my relaxation broken in upon at any moment as
yours was just now What confounded somersault in stocks has put that
face on you

Stacy looked up quickly with his brief laugh Im afraid youd be none
the wiser if I told you That was a pony express messenger from New
York You remember how Barker that night of the strike when we were
sitting together here or very near here proposed that we ought to have
a password or a symbol to call us together in case of emergency for
each others help Well let us say I have two partners one in Europe
and one in New York That was my password

And I hope no more serious than ours added Demorest

Stacy laughed his short laugh Nevertheless the conversation dragged
again The feverish gayety of the early part of the evening was gone
and they seemed to be suffering from the reaction They fell into their
old attitudes looking from the firelight to the distant bulk of Black
Spur without a word The occasional sound of the voices of promenaders
on the veranda at last ceased there was the noise of the shutting of
heavy doors below and Barker rose

Youll excuse me boys but I must go and say goodnight to little
Sta and see that hes all right I havent seen him since I got back
Butto Demorestyoull see him tomorrow when Kitty comes It is as
much as my life is worth to show him before she certifies him as being
presentable He paused and then added Dont wait up you fellows
for me sometimes the little chap wont let me go Its as if he
thought now Kittys away I was all he had But Ill be up early in the
morning and see you I dare say you and Stacy have a heap to say to each
other on business and you wont miss me So Ill say goodnight He
laughed lightly pressed the hands of his partners in his usual hearty
fashion and went out of the room leaving the gloom a little deeper
than before It was so unusual for Barker to be the first to leave
anybody or anything in trouble that they both noticed it But for
that said Demorest turning to Stacy as the door closed I should say
the dear fellow was absolutely unchanged But he seemed a little anxious
tonight

I shouldnt wonder Hes got two women on his mindas if one was not
enough

I dont understand You say his wife is foolish and this other

Never mind that now interrupted Stacy getting up and putting down
his pipe Lets talk a little business That other stuff will keep

By all means said Demorest with a smile settling down into his
chair a little wearily however I forgot business And I forgot my
dear Jim to congratulate you Ive heard all about you even in New
York Youre the man who according to everybody now holds the
finances of the Pacific Slope in his hands And he added leaning
affectionately towards his old partner I dont know any one better
equipped in honesty straightforwardness and courage for such a
responsibility than you

I only wish said Stacy looking thoughtfully at Demorest that I
didnt hold nearly a million of your money included in the finances of
the Pacific Slope

Why said the smiling Demorest as long as I am satisfied

Because I am not If youre satisfied Im a wretched idiot and not
fit for my position Now look here Phil When you wrote me to sell
out your shares in the Wheat Trust I was a little staggered I knew your
gait my boy and I knew too that while you didnt know enough to
trust your own opinions or feeling you knew too much to trust any ones
opinion that wasnt firstclass So I reckoned you had the straight tip
but I didnt see it Now I ought not to have been staggered if I was
fit for your confidence or if I was staggered I ought to have had
enough confidence in myself not to mind you See

I admit your logic old man said Demorest with an amused face but
I dont see your premises WHEN did I tell you to sell out

Two days ago You wrote just after you arrived

I have never written to you since I arrived I only telegraphed to you
to know where we should meet and received your message to come here

You never wrote me from San Francisco

Never

Stacy looked concernedly at his friend Was he in his right mind He had
heard of cases where melancholy brooding on a fixed idea had affected
the memory He took from his pocket a lettercase and selecting a
letter handed it to Demorest without speaking

Demorest glanced at it turned it over read its contents and in
a grave voice said There is something wrong here It is like my
handwriting but I never wrote the letter nor has it been in my hand
before

Stacy sprang to his side Then its a forgery

Wait a moment Demorest who although very grave was the more
collected of the two went to a writingdesk selected a sheet of paper
and took up a pen Now he said dictate that letter to me

Stacy began Demorests pen rapidly following him

DEAR JIMOn receipt of this get rid of my Wheat Trust shares at
whatever figure you can From the way things pointed in New York

Stop interrupted Demorest

Well said Stacy impatiently

Now my dear Jim said Demorest plaintively when did you ever know
me to write such a sentence as the way things pointed

Let me finish reading said Stacy This literary sensitiveness at such
a moment seemed little short of puerility to the man of business

From the way things pointed in New York continued Stacy and from
private advices received this seems to be the only prudent course
before the feathers begin to fly Longing to see you again and the dear
old stampingground at Heavy Tree Love to Barker Has the dear old boy
been at any fresh crank lately

Yours PHIL DEMOREST

The dictation and copy finished together Demorest laid the freshly
written sheet beside the letter Stacy had produced They were very much
alike and yet quite distinct from each other Only the signature seemed
identical

Thats the invariable mistake with the forger said Demorest he
always forgets that signatures ought to be identical with the text
rather than with each other

But Stacy did not seem to hear this or require further proof His face
was quite gray and his lips compressed until lost in his closely set
beard as he gazed fixedly out of the window For the first time really
concerned and touched Demorest laid his hand gently on his shoulder

Tell me Jim how much does this mean to you apart from me Dont think
of me

I dont know yet said Stacy slowly Thats the trouble And I wont
know until I know whos at the bottom of it Does anybody know of your
affairs with me

No one

No confidential friend eh

None

No one who has access to your secrets Nonowoman Excuse me Phil
he said as a peculiar look passed over Demorests face but this is
business

No he returned with that gentleness that used to frighten them
in the old days its ignorance You fellows always say Cherchez la
femme when you cant say anything else Come now he went on more
brightly look at the letter Heres a man commercially educated
for he has used the usual business formulas on receipt of this and
advices received which I wont merely say I dont use but which
few but commercial men use Next heres a man who uses slang not only
ineptly but artificially to give the letter the easy familiar turn
it hasnt from beginning to end I need only say my dear Stacy that
I dont write slang to you but that nobody who understands slang ever
writes it in that way And then the knowledge of my opinion of Barker is
such as might be gained from the reading of my letters by a person who
couldnt comprehend my feelings Now let me play inquisitor for a few
moments Has anybody access to my letters to YOU

No one I keep them locked up in a cabinet I only make memorandums of
your instructions which I give to my clerks but never your letters

But your clerks sometimes see you make memorandums from them

Yes but none of them have the ability to do this sort of thing nor
the opportunity of profiting by it

Has any womannow this is not retaliation my dear Jim for I fancy I
detect a womans cleverness and a womans stupidity in this forgeryany
access to your secrets or my letters A womans villainy is always
effective for the moment but always defective when probed

The look of scorn which passed over Stacys face was quite as distinct
as Demorests previous protest as he said contemptuously Im not such
a fool as to mix up petticoats with my business whatever I do

Well one thing more I have told you that in my opinion the forger has
a commercial education or style that he doesnt know me nor Barker and
dont understand slang Now I have to add what must have occurred
to you Jim that the forger is either a coward or his object is not
altogether mercenary for the same ability displayed in this letter
would on the signature alonehad it been on a check or drafthave
drawn from your bank twenty times the amount concerned Now what is the
actual loss by this forgery

Very little for youve got a good price for your stocks considering
the depreciation in realizing suddenly on so large an amount I told my
broker to sell slowly and in small quantities to avoid a panic But the
real loss is the control of the stock

But the amount I had was not enough to affect that said Demorest

No but I was carrying a large amount myself and together we
controlled the market and now I have unloaded too

You sold out and with your doubts said Demorest

Thats just it said Stacy looking steadily at his companions face
because I HAD doubts and it wont do for me to have them I ought
either to have disobeyed your letter and kept your stock and my own or
have done just what I did I might have hedged on my own stock but
I dont believe in hedging There is no middle course to a man in my
business if he wants to keep at the top No great success no great
power was ever created by it

Demorest smiled Yet you accept the alternative also which is ruin

Precisely said Stacy When you returned the other day you were bound
to find me what I was or a beggar But nothing between However he
added this has nothing to do with the forgery or he smiled grimly
everything to do with it Hush Barker is coming

There was a quick step along the corridor approaching the room The
next moment the door flew open to the bounding step and laughing face
of Barker Whatever of thoughtfulness or despondency he had carried from
the room with him was completely gone With his amazing buoyancy and
power of reaction he was there again in his usual frank cheerful
simplicity

I thought Id come in and say goodnight he began with a laugh
I got Sta asleep after some high jinks we had together and then I
reckoned it wasnt the square thing to leave just you two together the
first night you came And I remembered I had some business to talk over
too so I thought Id chip in again and take a hand Its only the shank
of the evening yet he continued gayly and we ought to sit up at
least long enough to see the old snowline vanish as we did in old
times But I say he added suddenly as he glanced from the one to the
other youve been having it pretty strong already Why you both look
as you did that night the backwater of the South Fork came into our
cabin Whats up

Nothing said Demorest hastily as he caught a glance of Stacys
impatient face Only all business is serious Barker boy though you
dont seem to feel it so

I reckon youre right there said Barker with a chuckle People
always laugh of course when I talk business so it might make it a
little livelier for you and more of a change if I chipped in now Only I
dont know which youll do Hand me a pipe Well he continued filling
the pipe Demorest shoved towards him you see I was in Sacramento
yesterday and I went into Van Loos branch office as I heard he was
there and I wanted to find out something about Kittys investments
which I dont think hes managing exactly right He wasnt there
however but as I was waiting I heard his clerks talk about a drop in
the Wheat Trust and that there was a lot of it put upon the market
They seemed to think that something had happened and it was going down
still further Now I knew it was your pet scheme and that Phil had a
lot of shares in it too so I just slipped out and went to a brokers
and told him to buy all he could of it And by Jove I was a little
taken aback when I found what I was in for for everybody seemed to have
unloaded and I found I hadnt money enough to pay margins but I knew
that Demorest was here and I reckoned on his seeing me through He
stopped and colored but added hopefully I reckon Im safe anyway
for just as the thing was over those same clerks of Van Loos came
bounding into the office to buy up everything And offered to take it
off my hands and pay the margins

And you said both men eagerly and in a breath

Barker stared at them and reddened and paled by turns I held on he
stammered You see boys

Both men had caught him by the arms How much have you got they said
shaking him as if to precipitate the answer

Its a heap said Barker Its a ghastly lot now I think of it Im
afraid Im in for fifty thousand if a cent

To his infinite astonishment and delight he was alternately hugged and
tossed backwards and forwards between the two men quite in the fashion
of the old days Breathless but laughing he at length gasped out What
does it all mean

Tell him everything JimEVERYTHING said Demorest quickly

Stacy briefly related the story of the forgery and then laid the letter
and its copy before him But Barker only read the forgery

How could YOU Stacyone of the three partners of Heavy Treebe
deceived Dont you see its Phils handwritingbut it isnt PHIL

But have you any idea WHO it is said Stacy

Not me said Barker with widely opened eyes You see it must be
somebody whom we are familiar with I cant imagine such a scoundrel

How did YOU know that Demorest had stock asked Stacy

He told me in one of his letters and advised me to go into it But just
then Kitty wanted money I think and I didnt go in

I remember it struck in Demorest But surely it was no secret My
name would be on the transfer books for any one to see

Not so said Stacy quickly You were one of the original
shareholders there was no transfer and the books as well as the shares
of the company were in my hands

And your clerks added Demorest

Stacy was silent After a pause he asked Did anybody ever see that
letter Barker

No one but myself and Kitty

And would she be likely to talk of it continued Stacy

Of course not Why should she Whom could she talk to Yet he stopped
suddenly and then with his characteristic reaction added with a laugh
Why no certainly not

Of course everybody knew that you had bought the shares at
Sacramento

Yes Why you know I told you the Van Loo clerks came to me and wanted
to take it off my hands

Yes I remember the Van Loo clerks they knew it of course said
Stacy with a grim smile Well boys he said with sudden alacrity
Im going to turn in for by sunup tomorrow I must be on my way to
catch the first train at the Divide for Frisco Well hunt this thing
down together for I reckon were all concerned in it he added
looking at the others and once more were partners as in the old
times Let us even say that Ive given Barkers signal or password he
added with a laugh and well stick together Barker boy he went on
grasping his younger partners hand your instinct has saved us this
time dd if I dont sometimes think it better than any other mans
sabe only he dropped his voice slightly I wish you had it in other
things than FINANCE Phil Ive a word to say to you alone before I go
I may want you to follow me

But what can I do said Barker eagerly Youre not going to leave me
out

Youve done quite enough for us old man said Stacy laying his hand
on Barkers shoulder And it may be for US to do something for YOU
Trot off to bed now like a good boy Ill keep you posted when the time
comes

Shoving the protesting and leavetaking Barker with paternal familiarity
from the room he closed the door and faced Demorest

Hes the best fellow in the world said Stacy quietly and has saved
the situation but we mustnt trust too much to him for the presentnot
even seem to

Nonsense man said Demorest impatiently Youre letting your
prejudices go too far Do you mean to say that you suspect his wife

Dn his wife said Stacy almost savagely Leave her out of this
Its Van Loo that I suspect It was Van Loo who I knew was behind it
who expected to profit by it and now we have lost him

But how said Demorest astonished

How repeated Stacy impatiently You know what Barker said Van Loo
either through stupidity fright or the wish to get the lowest prices
was too late to buy up the market If he had we might have openly
declared the forgery and if it was known that he or his friends had
profited by it even if we could not have proven his actual complicity
we could at least have made it too hot for him in California But said
Stacy looking intently at his friend do you know how the case stands
now

Well said Demorest a little uneasily under his friends keen eyes
weve lost that chance but weve kept control of the stock

You think so Well let me tell you how the case stands and the price
we pay for it said Stacy deliberately as he folded his arms and gazed
at Demorest You and I well known as old friends and former partners
for no apparent reasonfor we cannot prove the forgery nowhave thrown
upon the market all our stock with the usual effect of depreciating it
Another old friend and former partner has bought it in and sent up the
price A common trick a vulgar trick but not a trick worthy of James
Stacy or Stacys Bank

But why not simply declare the forgery without making any specific
charge against Van Loo

Do you imagine Phil that any man would believe it and the story of a
providentially appointed friend like Barker who saved us from loss
Why all California from Cape Mendocino to Los Angeles would roar
with laughter over it No We must swallow it and the reputation of
jockeying with the Wheat Trust too That Trusts as good as done for
for the present Now you know why I didnt want poor Barker to know it
nor have much to do with our search for the forger

It would break the dear fellows heart if he knew it said Demorest

Well its to save him from having his heart broken further that I
intend to find out this forger said Stacy grimly Goodnight Phil
Ill telegraph to you when I want you and then COME

With another grip of the hand he left Demorest to his thoughts In the
first excitement of meeting his old partners and in the later discovery
of the forgery Demorest had been diverted from his old sorrow and for
the time had forgotten it in sympathetic interest with the present
But to his horror when alone again he found that interest growing as
remote and vapid as the stories they had laughed over at the table and
even the excitement of the forged letter and its consequences began to
be as unreal as impotent as shadowy as the memory of the attempted
robbery in the old cabin on that very spot He was ashamed of that
selfishness which still made him cling to this past so much his own
that he knew it debarred him from the human sympathy of his comrades
And even Barker in whose courtship and marriage he had tried to
resuscitate his youthful emotions and condone his selfish errorseven
the suggestion of his unhappiness only touched him vaguely He would no
longer be a slave to the Past or the memory that had deluded him a few
hours ago He walked to the window alas there was the same prospect
that had looked upon his dreams had lent itself to his old visions
There was the eternal outline of the hills there rose the steadfast
pines there was no change in THEM It was this surrounding constancy
of nature that had affected him He turned away and entered the bedroom
Here he suddenly remembered that the mother of this vague enemy Van
Loofor his feeling towards him was still vague as few men really
hate the personality they dont knowhad only momentarily vacated
it and to his distaste of his own intrusion was now added the profound
irony of his sleeping in the same bed lately occupied by the mother of
the man who was suspected of having forged his name He smiled faintly
and looked around the apartment It was handsomely furnished and
although it still had much of the characterlessness of the hotel room
it was distinctly flavored by its last occupant and still brightened
by that mysterious instinct of the sex which is inevitable Where a man
would have simply left his forgotten slippers or collars there was
a glass of still unfaded flowers the cold marble top of the
dressingtable was littered with a few linen and silk toilet covers and
on the mantelshelf was a sheaf of photographs He walked towards them
mechanically glanced at them abstractedly and then stopped suddenly
with a beating heart Before him was the picture of his past the
photograph of the one woman who had filled his life

He cast a hurried glance around the room as if he half expected to see
the original start up before him and then eagerly seized it and hurried
with it to the light Yes yes It was SHEshe as she had lived in his
actual memory she as she had lived in his dream He saw her sweet eyes
but the frightened innocent trouble had passed from them there was
the sensitive elegance of her graceful figure in evening dress but the
figure was fuller and maturer Could he be mistaken by some wonderful
resemblance acting upon his too willing brain He turned the photograph
over No there on the other side written in her own childlike hand
endeared and familiar to his recollection was her own name and the
date It was surely she

How did it come there Did the Van Loos know her It was taken in
Venice there was the address of the photographers The Van Loos were
foreigners he remembered they had traveled perhaps had met her there
in 1858 that was the date in her handwriting that was the date on the
photographers address1858 Suddenly he laid the photograph down took
with trembling fingers a lettercase from his pocket opened it and
laid his last letter to her indorsed with the cruel announcement of her
death before him on the table He passed his hand across his forehead
and opened the letter It was dated 1856 The photograph must have been
taken two years AFTER her alleged death

He examined it again eagerly fixedly tremblingly A wild impulse to
summon Barker or Stacy on the spot was restrained with difficulty and
only when he remembered that they could not help him Then he began to
oscillate between a joy and a new fear which now for the first time
began to dawn upon him If the news of her death had been a fiendish
trick of her relations why had SHE never sought him It was not ill
health restraint nor fear there was nothing but happiness and
the strength of youth and beauty in that face and figure HE had not
disappeared from the world he was known of men more his memorable
good fortune must have reached her ears Had he wasted all these
miserable years to find himself abandoned forgotten perhaps even
a dupe For the first time the sting of jealousy entered his soul
Perhaps unconsciously to himself his strange and varying feelings that
afternoon had been the gathering climax of his mental condition at all
events in the sudden revulsion there was a shaking off of his apathetic
thought there was activity even if it was the activity of pain Here
was a mystery to be solved a secret to be discovered a past wrong to
be exposed an enemy or perhaps even a faithless love to be punished
Perhaps he had even saved his reason at the expense of his love He
quickly replaced the photograph on the mantelshelf returned the letter
carefully to his pocketbookno longer a souvenir of the past but a
proof of treacheryand began to mechanically undress himself He was
quite calm now and went to bed with a strange sense of relief and
slept as he had not slept since he was a boy

The whole hotel had sunk to rest by this time and then began the usual
slow nightly invasion and investment of it by nature For all its broad
verandas and glaring terraces its long ranges of windows and glittering
crest of cupola and tower it gradually succumbed to the more potent
influences around it and became their sport and playground The
mountain breezes from the distant summit swept down upon its flimsy
structure shook the great glass windows as with a strong hand and sent
the balm of bay and spruce through every chink and cranny In the great
hall and corridors the carpets billowed with the intruding blast along
the floors there was the murmur of the pines in the passages and the
damp odor of leaves in the diningroom There was the cry of night birds
in the creaking cupola and the swift rush of dark wings past bedroom
windows Lissome shapes crept along the terraces between the stolid
wooden statues or bolder scampered the whole length of the great
veranda In the lulling of the wind the breath of the woods was
everywhere even the aroma of swelling sapas if the ghastly stumps
on the deforested slope behind the hotel were bleeding afresh in the
dewless nightstung the eyes and nostrils of the sleepers

It was perhaps from such cause as this that Barker was awakened
suddenly by the voice of the boy from the crib beside him crying
Mamma mamma Taking the child in his arms he comforted him saying
she would come that morning and showed him the faint dawn already
veiling with color the ghostly pallor of the Sierras As they looked at
it a great star shot forth from its brethren and fell It did not fall
perpendicularly but seemed for some seconds to slip along the slopes
of Black Spur gleaming through the trees like a chariot of fire It
pleased the child to say that it was the light of mammas buggy that
was fetching her home and it pleased the father to encourage the boys
fancy And talking thus in confidential whispers they fell asleep once
more the fatherhimself a child in so many thingsholding the smaller
and frailer hand in his

They did not know that on the other side of the Divide the wife and
mother scared doubting and desperate by the side of her scared
doubting and desperate accomplice was flying down the slope on her
nightlong road to ruin Still less did they know that with the early
singing birds a careless horseman emerging from the trail as the
duststained buggy dashed past him glanced at it with a puzzled air
uttered a quiet whistle of surprise and then wheeling his horse gayly
cantered after it




CHAPTER V


In the exercise of his arduous profession Jack Hamlin had sat up all
night in the magnolia saloon of the Divide and as it was rather early
to go to bed he had after his usual habit shaken off the sedentary
attitude and prepared himself for sleep by a fierce preliminary
gallop in the woods Besides he had been a large winner and on those
occasions he generally isolated himself from his companions to avoid
foolish altercations with inexperienced players Even in fighting
Jack was fastidious and did not like to have his stomach for a real
difficulty distended and vitiated by small preliminary indulgences

He was just emerging from the wood into the highroad when a buggy dashed
past him containing a man and a woman The woman wore a thick veil the
man was almost undistinguishable from dust The glimpse was momentary
but dislike has a keen eye and in that glimpse Mr Hamlin recognized
Van Loo The situation was equally clear The bent heads and averted
faces the dust collected in the heedlessness of haste the early
hourindicating a nightlong flightall made it plain to him that
Van Loo was running away with some woman Mr Hamlin had no moral
scruples but he had the ethics of a sportsman which he knew Mr Van
Loo was not Whether the woman was an innocent schoolgirl or an actress
he was satisfied that Van Loo was doing a mean thing meanly Mr Hamlin
also had a taste for mischief and whether the woman was or was not
fair game he knew that for HIS purposes Van Loo was With the greatest
cheerfulness in the world he wheeled his horse and cantered after them

They were evidently making for the Divide and a fresh horse or to
take the coach due an hour later It was Mr Hamlins present object
to circumvent this and therefore it was quite in his way to return
Incidentally however the superior speed of his horse gave him the
opportunity of frequently lunging towards them at a furious pace which
had the effect of frantically increasing their own speed when he would
pull up with a silent laugh before he was fairly discovered and allow
the sound of his rapid horses hoofs to die out In this way he amused
himself until the straggling town of the Divide came in sight when
putting his spurs to his horse again he managed under pretense of
the animal becoming ungovernable to twice cross the bows of the
fugitives compelling them to slacken speed At the second of these
passages Van Loo apparently lost prudence and slashing out with his
whip the lash caught slightly on the counter of Hamlins horse Mr
Hamlin instantly acknowledged it by lifting his hat gravely and speeded
on to the hotel arriving at the steps and throwing himself from the
saddle exactly as the buggy drove up With characteristic audacity he
actually assisted the frightened and eager woman to alight and run into
the hotel But in this action her veil was accidentally lifted Mr
Hamlin instantly recognized the pretty woman who had been pointed out
to him in San Francisco as Mrs Barker the wife of one of the partners
whose fortunes had interested him five years ago It struck him that
this was an additional reason for his interference on Barkers account
although personally he could not conceive why a man should ever try
to prevent a woman from running away from him But then Mr Hamlins
personal experiences had been quite the other way

It was enough however to cause him to lay his hand lightly on Van
Loos arm as the latter leaping down was about to follow Mrs Barker
into the hotel Youll have time enough now said Hamlin

Time for what said Van Loo savagely

Time to apologize for having cut my horse with your whip said Jack
sweetly We dont want to quarrel before a woman

Ive no time for fooling said Van Loo endeavoring to pass

But Jacks hand had slipped to Van Loos wrist although he still
smiled cheerfully Ah Then you DID mean it and you propose to give me
satisfaction

Van Loo paled slightly he knew Jacks reputation as a duelist But
he was desperate You see my position he said hurriedly Im in a
hurry I have a lady with me No man of honor

You do me wrong interrupted Jack with a pained expressionyou do
indeed You are in a hurrywell I have plenty of time If you cannot
attend to me now why I will be glad to accompany you and the lady
to the next station Of course he added with a smile at a proper
distance and without interfering with the lady whom I am pleased
to recognize as the wife of an old friend It would be more sociable
perhaps if we had some general conversation on the road it would
prevent her being alarmed I might even be of some use to YOU If we are
overtaken by her husband on the road for instance I should certainly
claim the right to have the first shot at you Boy he called to the
hostler just sponge out Panchos mouth will you to be ready when the
buggy goes And loosening his grip of Van Loos wrist he turned away
as the other quickly entered the hotel

But Mr Van Loo did not immediately seek Mrs Barker He had already
some experience of that ladys nerves and irascibility on the drive and
had begun to see his error in taking so dangerous an impediment to
his flight from the country And another idea had come to him He
had already effected his purpose of compromising her with him in that
flight but it was still known only to few If he left her behind for
the foolish doting husband would not that devoted man take her back
to avoid a scandal and even forbear to pursue HIM for his financial
irregularities What were twenty thousand dollars of Mrs Barkers money
to the scandal of Mrs Barkers elopement Again the failure to realize
the forgery had left him safe and Barker was sufficiently potent with
the bank and Demorest to hush up that also Hamlin was now the only
obstacle to his flight but even he would scarcely pursue HIM if Mrs
Barker were left behind And it would be easier to elude him if he did

In his preoccupation Van Loo did not see that he had entered the
barroom but finding himself there he moved towards the bar a glass
of spirits would revive him As he drank it he saw that the room was
full of rough men apparently miners or packerssome of them Mexican
with here and there a Kanaka or Australian Two men more ostentatiously
clad though apparently on equal terms with the others were standing in
the corner with their backs towards him From the general silence as he
entered he imagined that he had been the subject of conversation and
that his altercation with Hamlin had been overheard Suddenly one of the
two men turned and approached him To his consternation he recognized
SteptoeSteptoe whom he had not seen for five years until last night
when he had avoided him in the courtyard of the Boomville Hotel His
first instinct was to retreat but it was too late And the spirits had
warmed him into temporary recklessness

You aint goin to be backed down by a shortcard gambler are yer
said Steptoe with coarse familiarity

I have a lady with me and am pressed for time said Van Loo quickly
He knows it otherwise he would not have dared

Well look here said Steptoe roughly I aint particularly sweet on
you as you know but I and these gentlemen he added glancing around
the room aint particularly sweet on Mr Jack Hamlin neither and we
kalkilate to stand by you if you say so Now I reckon you want to
get away with the woman and the quicker the better as youre afraid
therell be somebody after you afore long Thats the way it pans out
dont it Well when youre ready to go and you just tip us the wink
well get in a circle round Jack and cover him and if he starts after
you well send him on a little longer journeyeh boys

The men muttered their approval and one or two drew their revolvers
from their belts Van Loos heart which had leaped at first at this
proposal of help sank at this failure of his little plan of abandoning
Mrs Barker He hesitated and then stammered Thank you Haste is
everything with us now but I shouldnt mind leaving the lady among
CHIVALROUS GENTLEMEN like yourselves for a few hours only until I
could communicate with my friends and return to properly chastise this
scoundrel

Steptoe drew in his breath with a slight whistle and gazed at Van Loo
He instantly understood him But the plea did not suit Steptoe who
for purposes of his own wished to put Mrs Barker beyond her husbands
possible reach He smiled grimly I think youd better take the woman
with you he said I dont think he added in a lower voice that
the boys would like your leaving her Theyre very hightoned they
are he concluded ironically

Then said Van Loo with another desperate idea could you not let us
have saddlehorses instead of the buggy We could travel faster and in
the event of pursuit and anything happening to ME he added loftily
SHE at least could escape her pursuers vengeance

This suited Steptoe equally well as long as the guilty couple fled
TOGETHER and in the presence of witnesses But he was not deceived by
Van Loos heroic suggestion of selfsacrifice Quite right he said
sarcastically it shall be done and Ive no doubt ONE of you will
escape Ill send the horses round to the back door and keep the buggy
in front That will keep Jack there TOOwith the boys handy

But Mr Hamlin had quite as accurate an idea of Mr Van Loos methods
and of his OWN standing with Steptoes gang of roughs as Mr Steptoe
himself More than that he also had a hold on a smaller but more
devoted and loyal following than Steptoes The employees and hostlers
of the hotel worshiped him A single word of inquiry revealed to him
the fact that the buggy was NOT going on but that Mr Van Loo and
Mrs Barker WEREon two horses a temporary sidesaddle having been
constructed out of a mules packtree At which Mr Hamlin with his
usual audacity walked into the barroom and going to the bar leaned
carelessly against it Then turning to the lowering faces around him he
said with a flash of his white teeth Well boys Im calculating to
leave the Divide in a few minutes to follow some friends in the buggy
and it seems to me only the square thing to stand the liquor for the
crowd without prejudice to any feeling or roughness there may be
against me Everybody who knows me knows that Im generally there when
the band plays and Im pretty sure to turn up for THAT sort of thing
So youll just consider that Ive had a good game on the Divide and
Im reckoning its only fair to leave a little of it behind me here
to sweeten the pot until I call again I only ask you gentlemen to
drink success to my friends in the buggy as early and as often as you
can He flung two gold pieces on the counter and paused smiling

He was right in his conjecture Even the men who would have willingly
held him up a moment after at the bidding of Steptoe saw no reason
for declining a free drink without prejudice And it was a part of
the irony of the situation that Steptoe and Van Loo were also obliged
to participate to keep in with their partisans It was however an
opportune diversion to Van Loo who managed to get nearer the door
leading to the back entrance of the hotel and to Mr Jack Hamlin who
was watching him as the men closed up to the bar

The toast was drunk with acclamation followed by another and yet
another Steptoe and Van Loo who had kept their heads cool were both
wondering if Hamlins intention were to intoxicate and incapacitate the
crowd at the crucial moment and Steptoe smiled grimly over his superior
knowledge of their alcoholic capacity But suddenly there was the
greater diversion of a shout from the road the oncoming of a cloud of
red dust and the halt of another vehicle before the door This time it
was no jaded single horse and duststained buggy but a double team
of four spirited trotters whose coats were scarcely turned with foam
before a light station wagon containing a single man But that man
was instantly recognized by every one of the outside loungers and
stableboys as well as the staring crowd within the saloon It was James
Stacy the millionaire and banker No one but himself knew that he had
covered half the distance of a nightlong ride from Boomville in two
hours But before they could voice their astonishment Stacy had thrown
a letter to the obsequious landlord and then gathering up the reins had
sped away to the railroad station half a mile distant

Looks as if the Boss of Creation was in a hurry said one of the eager
gazers in the doorway Somebody goin to get smashed sure

More like as if he was just humpin himself to keep from getting
smashed said Steptoe The bank hasnt got over the effect of their
smart deal in the Wheat Trust Everything they had in their hands
tumbled yesterday in Sacramento Men like me and you aint goin to
trust their money to be jockeyed with in that style Nobody but a man
with a swelled head like Stacy would have even dared to try it on And
now by Gd hes got to pay for it

The harsh exultant tone of the speaker showed that he had quite
forgotten Van Loo and Hamlin in his superior hatred of the millionaire
and both men noticed it Van Loo edged still nearer to the door as
Steptoe continued Ever since he made that big strike on Heavy Tree
five years ago the country hasnt been big enough to hold him But mark
my words gentlemen the time aint far off when hell find a twofoot
ditch again and a pick and grub wages room enough and to spare for him
and his kind of cattle

Youre not drinking said Jack Hamlin cheerfully

Steptoe turned towards the bar and then started Wheres Van Loo he
demanded of Jack sharply

Jack jerked his thumb over his shoulder Gone to hurry up his girl I
reckon I calculate he aint got much time to fool away here

Steptoe glanced suspiciously at Jack But at the same moment they
were all startledeven Jack himselfat the apparition of Mrs Barker
passing hurriedly along the veranda before the windows in the direction
of the still waiting buggy Dn it said Steptoe in a fierce whisper
to the man next him Tell her not THEREat the back door But before
the messenger reached the door there was a sudden rattle of wheels and
with one accord all except Hamlin rushed to the veranda only to see
Mrs Barker driving rapidly away alone Steptoe turned back into the
room but Jack also had disappeared

For in the confusion created at the sight of Mrs Barker he had slipped
to the back door and found as he suspected only one horse and that
with a sidesaddle on His intuitions were right Van Loo when he
disappeared from the saloon had instantly fled taking the other horse
and abandoning the woman to her fate Jack as instantly leaped upon the
remaining saddle and dashed after him Presently he caught a glimpse of
the fugitive in the distance heard the halfangry halfironical shouts
of the crowd at the back door and as he reached the hilltop saw with a
mingling of satisfaction and perplexity Mrs Barker on the other road
still driving frantically in the direction of the railroad station At
which Mr Hamlin halted threw away his encumbering saddle and
good rider that he was remounted the horse barebacked but for his
blanketpad and thrusting his knees in the loose girths again dashed
forwardswith such good results that as Van Loo galloped up to the
stagecoach office at the next station and was about to enter the
waiting coach for Marysville the soft hand of Mr Hamlin was laid on
his shoulder

I told you said Jack blandly that I had plenty of time I would
have been here BEFORE and even overtaken you only you had the better
horse and the only saddle

Van Loo recoiled But he was now desperate and reckless Beckoning Jack
out of earshot of the other passengers he said with tightened lips
Why do you follow me What is your purpose in coming here

I thought said Hamlin dryly that I was to have the pleasure of
getting satisfaction from you for the insult you gave me

Well and if I apologize for it what then he said quickly

Hamlin looked at him quietly Well I think I also said something about
the lady being the wife of a friend of mine

And I have left her BEHIND Her husband can take her back without
disgrace for no one knows of her flight but you and me Do you think
your shooting me will save her It will spread the scandal far and wide
For I warn you that as I have apologized for what you choose to call my
personal insult unless you murder me in cold blood without witness I
shall let them know the REASON of your quarrel And I can tell you more
if you only succeed in STOPPING me here and make me lose my chance of
getting away the scandal to your friend will be greater still

Mr Hamlin looked at Van Loo curiously There was a certain amount
of conviction in what he said He had never met this kind of creature
before He had surpassed even Hamlins first intuition of his character
He amused and interested him But Mr Hamlin was also a man of the
world and knew that Van Loos reasoning might be good He put his hands
in his pockets and said gravely What IS your little game

Van Loo had been seized with another inspiration of desperation Steptoe
had been partly responsible for this situation Van Loo knew that Jack
and Steptoe were not friends He had certain secrets of Steptoes that
might be of importance to Jack Why should he not try to make friends
with this powerful freelance and halfoutlaw

Its a game he said significantly that might be of interest to your
friends to hear

Hamlin took his hands out of his pockets turned on his heel and said
Come with me

But I must go by that coach now said Van Loo desperately orIve
told you what would happen

Come with me said Jack coolly If Im satisfied with what you tell
me Ill put you down at the next station an hour before that coach gets
there

You swear it said Van Loo hesitatingly

Ive SAID it returned Jack Come and Van Loo followed Mr Hamlin
into the station hotel




CHAPTER VI


The abrupt disappearance of Jack Hamlin and the strange lady and
gentleman visitor was scarcely noticed by the other guests of the Divide
House and beyond the circle of Steptoe and his friends who were a
distinct party and strangers to the town there was no excitement
Indeed the hotel proprietor might have confounded them together and
perhaps Van Loo was not far wrong in his belief that their identity had
not been suspected Nor were Steptoes followers very much concerned in
an episode in which they had taken part only at the suggestion of their
leader and which had terminated so tamely That they would have liked
a row in which Jack Hamlin would have been incidentally forced to
disgorge his winnings there was no doubt but that their interference
was asked solely to gratify some personal spite of Steptoes against Van
Loo was equally plain to them There was some grumbling and outspoken
criticism of his methods

This was later made more obvious by the arrival of another guest for
whom Steptoe and his party were evidently waiting He was a short stout
man whose heavy red beard was trimmed a little more carefully than when
he was first known to Steptoe as Alky Hall the drunkard of Heavy Tree
Hill His dress too exhibited a marked improvement in quality and
style although still characterized in the waist and chest by the
unbuttoned freedom of portly and slovenly middle age Civilization had
restricted his potations or limited them to certain festivals known as
sprees and his face was less puffy and sodden But with the accession
of sobriety he had lost his good humor and had the irritability and
intolerance of virtuous restraint

Ye neednt ladle out any of your fortyrod whiskey to me he said
querulously to Steptoe as he filed out with the rest of the party
through the barroom into the adjacent apartment I want to keep my
head level till our business is over and I reckon it wouldnt hurt you
and your gang to do the same Theyre less likely to blab and there are
few doors that whiskey wont unlock he added as Steptoe turned the
key in the door after the party had entered

The room had evidently been used for meetings of directors or political
caucuses and was roughly furnished with notched and whittled armchairs
and a single long deal table on which were ink and pens The men sat
down around it with a halfembarrassed halfcontemptuous attitude of
formality their bent brows and isolated looks showing little community
of sentiment and scarcely an attempt to veil that individual selfishness
that was prominent Still less was there any essay of companionship or
sympathy in the manner of Steptoe as he suddenly rapped on the table
with his knuckles

Gentlemen he said with a certain deliberation of utterance as if
he enjoyed his own coarse directness I reckon you all have a sort of
general idea what you were picked up for or you wouldnt be here
But you may or may not know that for the present you are honest
hardworking minersthe backbone of the State of Californyand that
you have formed yourselves into a company called the Blue Jay
and youve settled yourselves on the Bar below Heavy Tree Hill on a
deserted claim of the Marshall Brothers not half a mile from where
the big strike was made five years ago Thats what you ARE gentlemen
thats what youll continue TO BE until the jobs finished and he
added with a sudden dominance that they all felt the man who forgets
it will have to reckon with me Now he continued resuming his
former ironical manner now what are the cold facts of the case The
Marshalls worked this claim ever since 49 and never got anything out
of it then they dropped off or died out leaving only one brother Tom
Marshall to work what was left of it Well a few days ago HE found
indications of a big lead in the rock and instead of rushin out and
yellin like an honest man and callin in the boys to drink he sneaks
off to Frisco and goes to the bank to get em to take a hand in it
Well you know when Jim Stacy takes a hand in anything ITS BOTH
HANDS and the bank wouldnt see it until he promised to guarantee
possession of the whole abandoned claimdips spurs and
anglesand let them work the whole thing which the dd fool DID
and the bank agreed to send an expert down there tomorrow to report
But while he was away some one on our side who was an expert also got
wind of it and made an examination all by himself and found it was a
vein sure enough and a big thing and some one else on our side found
out too all that Marshall had promised the bank and what the bank
had promised him Now gentlemen when the bank sends down that expert
tomorrow I expect that he will find YOU IN POSSESSION of every part of
the deserted claim except the spot where Tom is still working

And what good is that to us asked one of the men contemptuously

Good repeated Steptoe harshly Well if youre not as dd a fool
as Marshall youll see that if he has struck a lead or vein its bound
to run across OUR CLAIMS and whats to keep us from sinking for it as
long as Marshall hasnt worked the other claims for years nor preempted
them for this lead

Whatll keep him from preempting now

Our possession

But if he can prove that the brothers left their claims to him to keep
hell just send the sheriff and his posse down upon us persisted the
first speaker

It will take him three months to do that by law and the sheriff and
his posse cant do it before as long as were in peaceable possession of
it And by the time that expert and Marshall return theyll find us in
peaceful possession unless were such blasted fools as to stay talking
about it here

But whats to prevent Marshall from getting a gang of his own to drive
us off

Now your talkin and not yelpin said Steptoe with slow insolence
Dd if I didnt begin to think you kalkilated I was goin to employ
you as lawyers Nothing is to prevent him from gettin up HIS gang
and we hope hell do it for you see it puts us both on the same level
before the law for were both BREAKIN IT And we kalkilate that were
as good as any roughs they can pick up at Heavy Tree

I reckon Ye can count us in said half a dozen voices eagerly

But whats the job goin to pay us persisted a Sydney man An arter
weve beat off this other gang are we going to scrub along on grub
wages until were yanked out by processsarvers three months later If
thats the ticket Im not in it I arent no by quartz miner

We aint going to do no more MINING there than the bank said Steptoe
fiercely And the bank aint going to wait no three months for the end
of the lawsuit Theyll float the stock of that mine for a couple of
millions and get out of it with a million before a month And theyll
have to buy us off to do that What theyll pay will depend upon the
lead but we dont move off those claims for less than five thousand
dollars which will be two hundred and fifty dollars to each man But
said Steptoe in a lower but perfectly distinct voice if there should
be a rowand they BEGIN itand in the scuffle Tom Marshall their
only witness should happen to get in the way of a revolver or have his
head caved in there might be some difficulty in their holdin ANY OF
THE MINE against honest hardworking miners in possession You hear me

There was a breathless silence for the moment and a slight movement
of the men in their chairs but never in fear or protest Every one had
heard the speaker distinctly and every man distinctly understood him
Some of them were criminals one or two had already the stain of blood
on their hands but even the most timid who at other times might have
shrunk from suggested assassination saw in the speakers words only the
fair removal of a natural enemy

All right boys Im ready to wade in at once Why aint we on the road
now We might have been but for foolin our time away on that man Van
Loo

Van Loo repeated Hall eagerlyVan Loo Was he here

Yes said Steptoe shortly administering a kick under the table to
Hall as he had no wish to revive the previous irritability of his
comrades Hes gone but turning to the others youd have had to
wait for Mr Halls arrival anyhow And now youve got your order you
can start Go in two parties by different roads and meet on the other
side of the hotel at Hymettus Ill be there before you Pick up some
shovels and drills as you go remember youre honest miners but dont
forget your shootinirons for all that Now scatter

It was well that they did vacating the room more cheerfully and
sympathetically than they had entered it or Halls manifest disturbance
over Van Loos visit would have been noticed When the last man had
disappeared Hall turned quickly to Steptoe Well what did he say
Where has he gone

Dont know said Steptoe with uneasy curtness He was running away
with a womanwell Mrs Barker if you want to know he added with
rising anger the wife of one of those cursed partners Jack Hamlin was
here and was jockeying to stop him and interfered But what the devil
has that job to do with our job He was losing his temper everything
seemed to turn upon this infernal Van Loo

He wasnt running away with Mrs Barker gasped Hallit was with
her MONEY and the fear of being connected with the Wheat Trust swindle
which he organized and with our money which I lent him for the same
purpose And he knows all about that job for I wanted to get him to go
into it with us Your name and mine aint any too sweetsmelling for
the bank and we ought to have a middleman who knows business to arrange
with them The bank darent object to him for theyve employed him in
even shadier transactions than this when THEY didnt wish to appear I
knew he was in difficulties along with Mrs Barkers speculations but
I never thought him up to this And he added with sudden desperation
YOU trusted him too

In an instant Steptoe caught the frightened man by the shoulders and was
bearing him down on the table Are you a traitor a liar or a besotted
fool he said hoarsely Speak WHEN and WHERE did I trust him

You said in your noteI wastohelp him gasped Hall

My note repeated Steptoe releasing Hall with astonished eyes

Yes said Hall tremblingly searching in his vest pocket I brought
it with me It isnt much of a note but theres your signature plain
enough

He handed Steptoe a torn piece of paper folded in a threecornered
shape Steptoe opened it He instantly recognized the paper on which
he had written his name and sent up to his wife at the Boomville Hotel
But added to it in apparently the same hand in smaller characters
were the words Help Van Loo all you can

The blood rushed into his face But he quickly collected himself and
said hurriedly All right I had forgotten it Let the dd sneak go
Weve got whats a thousand times better in this claim at Marshalls
and its well that he isnt in it to scoop the lions share Only we
must not waste time getting there now You go there first and at once
and set those rascals to work Ill follow you before Marshall comes up
Get Ill settle up here

His face darkened once more as Hall hurried away leaving him alone He
drew out the piece of paper from his pocket and stared at it again Yes
it was the one he had sent to his wife How did Van Loo get hold of
it Was he at the hotel that night Had he picked it up in the hall or
passage when the servant dropped it When Hall handed him the paper and
he first recognized it a fiendish thought followed by a spasm of more
fiendish rage had sent the blood to his face But his crude common
sense quickly dismissed that suggestion of his wifes complicity with
Van Loo But had she seen him passing through the hotel that night and
had sought to draw from him some knowledge of his early intercourse with
the child and confessed everything and even produced the paper with
his signature as a proof of identity Women had been known to do such
desperate things Perhaps she disbelieved her sons aversion to her and
was trying to sound Van Loo As for the forged words by Van Loo and the
use he had put them to he cared little He believed the man was capable
of forgery indeed he suddenly remembered that in the old days his
son had spoken innocently but admiringly of Van Loos wonderful
chirographical powers and his faculty of imitating the writings of
others and how he had even offered to teach him A new and exasperating
thought came into his feverish consciousness What if Van Loo in
teaching the boy had even made use of him as an innocent accomplice to
cover up his own tricks The suggestion was no question of moral ethics
to Steptoe nor of his sons possible contamination although since the
night of the big strike he had held different views it was simply a
fierce selfish jealousy that ANOTHER might have profited by the lads
helplessness and inexperience He had been tormented by this jealousy
before in his sons liking for Van Loo He had at first encouraged his
admiration and imitative regard for this smooth swindlers graces and
accomplishments which though he scorned them himself he was after
the common parental infatuation willing that the boy should profit by
Incapable through his own consciousness of distinguishing between Van
Loos superficial polish and the true breeding of a gentleman he
had only looked upon it as an equipment for his son which might be
serviceable to himself He had told his wife the truth when he informed
her of Van Loos fears of being reminded of their former intimacy but
he had not told her how its discontinuance after they had left Heavy
Tree Hill had affected her son and how he still cherished his old
admiration for that specious rascal Nor had he told her how this had
stung him through his own selfish greed of the boys affection Yet now
that it was possible that she had met Van Loo that evening she might
have become aware of Van Loos power over her child How she would
exult for all her pretended hatred of Van Loo How perhaps they had
plotted together How Van Loo might have become aware of the place where
his son was kept and have been bribed by the mother to tell her He
stopped in a whirl of giddy fancies His strong common sense in all
other things had been hitherto proof against such idle dreams or
suggestions but the very strength of his parental love and jealousy had
awakened in him at last the terrors of imagination

His first impulse had been to seek his wife regardless of discovery or
consequences at Hymettus where she had said she was going It was on
his way to the rendezvous at Marshalls claim But this he as instantly
set aside it was his SON he must find SHE might not confess or might
deceive himthe boy would not and if his fears were correct she could
be arraigned afterwards It was possible for him to reach the little
Mission church and school secluded in a remote valley by the old
Franciscan fathers where he had placed the boy for the last few years
unknown to his wife It would be a long ride but he could still reach
Heavy Tree Hill afterwards before Marshall and the expert arrived And
he had a feeling he had never felt before on the eve of a desperate
adventurethat he must see the boy first He remembered how the child
had often accompanied him in his flight and how he had gained strength
and it seemed to him a kind of luck from the touch of that small hand
in his Surely it was necessary now that at least his mind should be at
rest regarding HIM on the eve of an affair of this moment Perhaps he
might never see him again At any other time and under the influence of
any other emotion he would have scorned such a sentimentalismhe who
had never troubled himself either with preparation for the future or
consideration for the past But at that moment he felt both He drew
a long breath He could catch the next train to the Three Boulders and
ride thence to San Felipe He hurriedly left the room settled with the
landlord and galloped to the station By the irony of circumstances the
only horse available for that purpose was Mr Hamlins own

By two oclock he was at the Three Boulders where he got a fast horse
and galloped into San Felipe by four As he descended the last slope
through the fastnesses of pines towards the little valley overlooked
in its remoteness and purely pastoral simplicity by the goldseeking
immigrantsits seclusion as one of the furthest northern Californian
missions still preserved through its insignificance and the efforts of
the remaining Brotherhood who used it as an infirmary and a school for
the few remaining Spanish familieshe remembered how he once blundered
upon it with the boy while hotly pursued by a hue and cry from one of
the larger towns and how he found sanctuary there He remembered how
when the pursuit was over he had placed the boy there under the padres
charge He had lied to his wife regarding the whereabouts of her son
but he had spoken truly regarding his free expenditure for the boys
maintenance and the good fathers had accepted equally for the childs
sake as for the Churchs sake the generous restitution which this
coarse powerful ruffianly looking father was apparently seeking to
make He was quite aware of it at the time and had equally accepted it
with grim cynicism but it now came back to him with a new and smarting
significance Might THEY too not succeed in weaning the boys
affection from him or if the mother had interfered would they not side
with her in claiming an equal right He had sometimes laughed to himself
over the security of this hidingplace so unknown and so unlikely to be
discovered by her yet within easy reach of her friends and his enemies
he now ground his teeth over the mistake which his doting desire to keep
his son accessible to him had caused him to make He put spurs to his
horse dashed down the little narrow illpaved street through
the deserted plaza and pulled up in a cloud of dust before the only
remaining tower with its cracked belfry of the halfruined Mission
church A new dormitory and schoolbuilding had been extended from its
walls but in a subdued harmonious modest way quite unlike the usual
glaring whitepine glories of provincial towns Steptoe laughed to
himself bitterly Some of his money had gone in it

He seized the horsehair rope dangling from a bell by the wall and rang
it sharply A softfooted priest appearedFather Dominico Eddy
Horncastle Ah yes Eddy dear child is gone

Gone shouted Steptoe in a voice that startled the padre Where
When With whom

Pardon senor but for a timeonly a pasear to the next village It is
his saints dayhe has halfholiday He is a good boy It is a little
pleasure for him and for us

Oh said Steptoe softened into a rough apology I forgot All right
Has he had any visitors latelylady for instance

Father Dominico cast a look half of fright half of reproval upon his
guest

A lady HERE

In his relief Steptoe burst into a coarse laugh Of course you see
I forgot that too I was thinking of one of his woman folks you
knowrelativesaunts Was there any other visitor

Only one Ah we know the senors rules regarding his son

One repeated Steptoe Who was it

Oh quite an hidalgoan old friend of the childsmost polite
most accomplished fluent in Spanish perfect in deportment The Senor
Horncastle surely could find nothing to object to Father Pedro was
charmed with him A man of affairs and yet a good Catholic too It
was a Senor Van LooDon Paul the boy called him and they talked of the
boys studies in the old days as ifindeed but for the stranger being
a caballero and man of the worldas if he had been his teacher

It was a proof of the intensity of the fathers feelings that they had
passed beyond the power of his usual coarse brutal expression and he
only stared at the priest with a dull red face in which the blood seemed
to have stagnated Presently he said thickly When did he come

A few days ago

Which way did Eddy go

To Browns Mills scarcely a league away He will be hereeven nowon
the instant But the senor will come into the refectory and take some
of the old Mission wine from the Catalan grape planted one hundred and
fifty years ago until the dear child returns He will be so happy

No Im in a hurry I will go on and meet him He took off his hat
mopped his crisp wet hair with his handkerchief and in a thick slow
impeded voice more suggestive than the outburst he restrained said
And as long as my son remains here that man Van Loo must not pass
this gate speak to him or even see him You hear me See to it you
and all the others See to it I say orHe stopped abruptly clapped
his hat on the swollen veins of his forehead turned quickly passed out
without another word through the archway into the road and before the
good priest could cross himself or recover from his astonishment the
thud of his horses hoofs came from the dusty road

It was ten minutes before his face resumed its usual color But in that
ten minutes as if some of the struggle of his rider had passed into
him his horse was sweating with exhaustion and fear For in that ten
minutes in this new imagination with which he was cursed he had killed
both Van Loo and his son and burned the refectory over the heads of the
treacherous priests Then quite himself again a voice came to him from
the rocky trail above the road with the hail of Father He started
quickly as a lad of fifteen or sixteen came bounding down the hillside
and ran towards him

You passed me and I called to you but you did not seem to hear
said the boy breathlessly Then I ran after you Have you been to the
Mission

Steptoe looked at him quite as breathlessly but from a deeper emotion
He was even at first sight a handsome lad glowing with youth and the
excitement of his run and as the father looked at him he could
see the likeness to his mother in his clearcut features and even a
resemblance to himself in his square compact chest and shoulders and
crisp black curls A thrill of purely animal paternity passed over him
the fierce joy of his flesh over his own flesh His own son by God
They could not take THAT from him they might plot swindle fawn
cheat lie and steal away his affections but there he was plain to
all eyes his own son his very son

Come here he said in a singular halfweary and halfprotesting
voice which the boy instantly recognized as his fathers accents of
affection

The boy hesitated as he stood on the edge of the road and pointed with
mingled mischief and fastidiousness to the depths of impalpable red
dust that lay between him and the horseman Steptoe saw that he was very
smartly attired in holiday guise with white duck trousers and patent
leather shoes and after the Spanish fashion wore black kid gloves He
certainly was a bit of a dandy as he had said The fathers whole face
changed as he wheeled and came before the lad who lifted up his arms
expectantly They had often ridden together on the same horse

No rides today in that toggery Eddy he said in the same voice But
Ill get down and well go and sit somewhere under a tree and have some
talk Ive got a bit of a job thats hurrying me and I cant waste
time

Not one of your old jobs father I thought you had quite given that
up

The boy spoke more carelessly than reproachfully or even wonderingly
yet as he dismounted and tethered his horse Steptoe answered
evasively Its a big thing sonny maybe well make our eternal
fortune and then well light out from this hole and have a gay time
elsewhere Come along

He took the boys gloved right hand in his own powerful grasp and
together they clambered up the steep hillside to a rocky ledge on which
a fallen pine from above had crashed snapped itself in twain and then
left its withered crown to hang half down the slope while the other
half rested on the ledge On this they sat looking down upon the road
and the tethered horse A gentle breeze moved the treetops above their
heads and the westering sun played hideandseek with the shifting
shadows The boys face was quick and alert with all that moved round
him but without thought the fathers face was heavy except for the
eyes that were fixed upon his son

Van Loo came to the Mission he said suddenly

The boys eyes glittered quickly like a steel that pierced the fathers
heart Oh he said simply then it was the padre told you

How did he know you were here asked Steptoe

I dont know said the boy quietly I think he said something but
Ive forgotten it But it was mighty good of him to come for I thought
you know that he did not care to see me after Heavy Tree and that hed
gone back on us

What did he tell you continued Steptoe Did he talk of me or of your
mother

No said the boy but without any show of interest or sympathy we
talked mostly about old times

Tell ME about those old times Eddy You never told me anything about
them

The boy momentarily arrested more by something in the tone of his
fathers voicea weakness he had never noticed beforethan by any
suggestion of his words said with a laugh Oh only about what we
used to do when I was very little and used to call myself his little
brotherdont you remember long before the big strike on Heavy Tree
They were gay times we had then

And how he used to teach you to imitate other peoples handwriting
said Steptoe

What made you think of that pop said the boy with a slight wonder
in his eyes Why thats the very thing we DID talk about

But you didnt do it again you aint done it since said Steptoe
quickly

Lord no said the boy contemptuously There aint no chance now and
there wouldnt be any fun in it It isnt like the old times when him
and me were all alone and we used to write letters as coming from other
people to all the boys round Heavy Tree and the Bar and sometimes as
far as Boomville to get them to do things and theyd think the letters
were real and theyd do em And thered be the biggest kind of a row
and nobody ever knew who did it

Steptoe stared at this flesh of his own flesh half in relief half in
frightened admiration Sitting astride the log his elbows on his knees
and his gloved hands supporting his round cheeks the boys handsome
face became illuminated with an impish devilry which the father had
never seen before With dancing eyes he went on It was one of those
very games we played so long ago that he wanted to see me about and
wanted me to keep mum about for some of the folks that he played it on
were around here now It was a game we got off on one of the big strike
partners long before the strike Ill tell YOU dad for you know
what happened afterwards and youll be glad Well that
partnerDemorestwas a kind of silly you remembera sort of Miss
Nancyish fellowalways gloomy and lovesick after his girl in the
States Well wed written lots of letters to girls from their chaps
before and got lots of fun out of it but we had even a better show
for a game here for it happened that Van Loo knew all about the
girlthings that even the mans own partners didnt for Van Loos
mother was a sort of a friend of the girls family and traveled about
with her and knew that the girl was spoony over this Demorest and that
they corresponded So knowing that Van Loo was employed at Heavy Tree
she wrote to him to find out all about Demorest and how to stop their
foolish nonsense for the girls parents didnt want her to marry a
brokendown miner like him So we thought wed do it our own way and
write a letter to her as if it was from him dont you see I wanted to
make him call her awful names and say that he hated her that he was a
murderer and a horsethief and that he had killed a policeman and that
he was thinking of becoming a Digger Injin and having a Digger squaw
for a wife which he liked better than her Lord dad you ought to have
seen what stuff I made up The boy burst into a shrill halffeminine
laugh and Steptoe catching the infection laughed loudly in his own
coarse brutal fashion

For some moments they sat there looking in each others faces shaking
with sympathetic emotion the father forgetting the purpose of his
coming there his rage over Van Loos visit and even the rendezvous
to which his horse in the road below was waiting to bring him the son
forgetting their retreat from Heavy Tree Hill and his shameful vagabond
wanderings with that father in the years that followed The sinking sun
stared blankly in their faces the protecting pines above them moved by
a stronger gust shook a few cones upon them an enormous crow mockingly
repeated the fathers coarse laugh and a squirrel scampered away from
the strangely assorted pair as Steptoe wiping his eyes and forehead
with his pockethandkerchief said

And did you send it

Oh Van Loo thought it too strong Said that those sort of lovesick
fools made more fuss over little things than they did over big things
and he sort of toned it down and fixed it up himself But it told For
there were never any more letters in the postoffice in her handwriting
and there wasnt any posted to her in his

They both laughed again and then Steptoe rose I must be getting
along he said looking curiously at the boy Ive got to catch a
train at Three Boulders Station

Three Boulders repeated the boy Im going there too on Friday to
meet Father Cipriano

I reckon my work will be all done by Friday said Steptoe musingly
Standing thus holding his boys hand he was thinking that the real
fight at Marshalls would not take place at once for it might take a
day or two for Marshall to gather forces But he only pressed his sons
hand gently

I wish you would sometimes take me with you as you used to said the
boy curiously Im bigger now and wouldnt be in your way

Steptoe looked at the boy with a choking sense of satisfaction and
pride But he said No and then suddenly with simulated humor Dont
you be taken in by any letters from ME such as you and Van Loo used to
write You hear

The boy laughed

And continued Steptoe if anybody says I sent for you dont you
believe them

No said the boy smiling

And dont you even believe Im dead till you see me so You understand
By the way Father Pedro has some money of mine kept for you Now hurry
back to school and say you met me but that I was in a great hurry I
reckon I may have been rather rough to the priests

They had reached the lower road again and Steptoe silently unhitched
his horse Goodby he said as he laid his hand on the boys arm

Goodby dad

He mounted his horse slowly Well he said smilingly looking down the
road you aint got anything more to say to me have you

No dad

Nothin you want

Nothin dad

All right Goodby

He put spurs to his horse and cantered down the road without looking
back The boy watched him with idle curiosity until he disappeared from
sight and then went on his way whistling and striking off the heads of
the wayside weeds with his walkingstick




CHAPTER VII


The sun arose so brightly over Hymettus on the morning after the
meeting of the three partners that it was small wonder that Barkers
impressionable nature quickly responded to it and without awakening
the still sleeping child he dressed hurriedly and was the first
to greet it in the keen air of the slope behind the hotel To his
pantheistic spirit it had always seemed as natural for him to early
welcome his returning brothers of the woods and hills as to say
goodmorning to his fellow mortals And in the joy of seeing Black Spur
rising again to his level in the distance before him he doffed his hat
to it with a return of his old boyish habit laid his arm caressingly
around the great girth of the nearest pine clapped his hands to the
scampering squirrels in his path and whistled to the dipping jays
In this way he quite forgot the more serious affairs of the preceding
night or rather saw them only in the gilding of the morning until
looking up he perceived the tall figure of Demorest approaching him
and then it struck him with his first glance at his old partners face
that his usual suave gentle melancholy had been succeeded by a critical
cynicism of look and a restrained bitterness of accent Barkers loyal
heart smote him for his own selfishness Demorest had been hard hit
by the discovery of the forgery and Stacys concern in it and had
doubtless passed a restless night while he Barker had forgotten all
about it I thought of knocking at your door as I passed he said
with sympathetic apology but I was afraid I might disturb you Isnt
it glorious here Quite like the old hill Look at that lizard he
hasnt moved since he first saw me Do you remember the one who used to
steal our sugar and then stiffen himself into stone on the edge of the
bowl until he looked like an ornamental handle to it he continued
rebounding again into spirits

Barker said Demorest abruptly what sort of woman is this Mrs Van
Loo whose rooms I occupy

Oh said Barker with optimistic innocence a most proper woman old
chap Whitehaired welldressed with a little foreign accent and a
still more foreign courtesy Why you dont suppose wed

But what is she like said Demorest impatiently

Well said Barker thoughtfully shes the kind of woman who might be
Van Loos mother I suppose

You mean the mother of a forger and a swindler asked Demorest
sharply

There are no mothers of swindlers and forgers said Barker gravely
in the way you mean Its only those poor devils he said pointing
nevertheless with a certain admiration to a circling sparrowhawk above
him who have inherited instincts What I mean is that she might be Van
Loos mother because he didnt SELECT her

Where did she come from and how long has she been here asked
Demorest

She came from abroad I believe And she came here just after you left
Van Loo after he became secretary of the Ditch Company sent for her
and her daughter to keep house for him But youll see her today or
tomorrow probably when she returns Ill introduce you shell be
rather glad to meet some one from abroad and all the more if he happens
to be rich and distinguished and eligible for her daughter He stopped
suddenly in his smile remembering Demorests lifelong secret But to
his surprise his companions face instead of darkening as it was
wont to do at any such allusion brightened suddenly with a singular
excitement as he answered dryly Ah well if the girl is pretty who
knows

Indeed his spirits seemed to have returned with strange vivacity
as they walked back to the hotel and he asked many other questions
regarding Mrs Van Loo and her daughter and particularly if the
daughter had also been abroad When they reached the veranda they found
a few early risers eagerly reading the Sacramento papers which had just
arrived or in little knots discussing the news Indeed they would
probably have stopped Barker and his companion had not Barker anxious
to relieve his friends curiosity hurried with him at once to the
managers office

Can you tell me exactly when you expect Mrs Van Loo to return asked
Barker quickly

The manager with difficulty detached himself from the newspaper which
he too was anxiously perusing and said with a peculiar smile Well
no she WAS to return today but if youre wanting to keep her rooms
I should say there wouldnt be any trouble about it as shell hardly be
coming back here NOW Shes rather high and mighty in style I know and
a determined sort of critter but I reckon she and her daughter wouldnt
care much to be waltzing round in public after what has happened

I dont understand you said Demorest impatiently WHAT has
happened

Havent you heard the news said the manager in surprise Its in
all the Sacramento papers Van Loo is a defaulterhas hypothecated
everything he had and skedaddled

Barker started He was not thinking of the loss of his wifes
moneyonly of HER disappointment and mortification over it Poor girl
Perhaps she was also worrying over his resentmentas if she did not
know him He would go to her at once at Boomville Then he remembered
that she was coming with Mrs Horncastle and might be already on
her way here by rail or coach and he would miss her Demorest in the
meantime had seized a paper and was intently reading it

Theres bad news too for your friend your old partner said the
manager half sympathetically half interrogatively There has been a
drop out in everything the bank is carrying and everybody is unloading
Two firms failed in Frisco yesterday that were carrying things for the
bank and have thrown everything back on it There was an awful panic
last night and they say none of the big speculators know where they
stand Three of our best customers in the hotel rushed off to the bay
this morning but Stacy himself started before daylight and got the
through night express to stop for him on the Divide on signal Shall I
send any telegrams that may come to your room

Demorest knew that the manager suspected him of being interested in the
bank and understood the purport of the question He answered with calm
surprise that he was expecting no telegrams and added But if Mrs
Van Loo returns I beg you to at once let me know and taking Barkers
arm he went in to breakfast Seated by themselves Demorest looked at
his companion Im afraid Barker boy that this thing is more serious
to Jim than we expected last night or than he cared to tell us And
you old man I fear are hurt a little by Van Loos flight He had some
money of your wifes hadnt he

Barker who knew that the bulk of Demorests fortune was in Stacys
hands was touched at this proof of his unselfish thought and answered
with equal unselfishness that he was concerned only by the fear of Mrs
Barkers disappointment Why Lord Phil whether shes lost or saved
her money its nothing to me I gave it to her to do what she liked with
it but Im afraid shell be worrying over what I think of itas if
she did not know me And Im half a mind if it were not for missing
her to go over to Boomville where shes stopping

I thought you said she was in San Francisco said Demorest
abstractedly

Barker colored Yes he answered quickly But Ive heard since that
she stopped at Boomville on the way

Then dont let ME keep you here returned Demorest For if Jim
telegraphs to me I shall start for San Francisco at once and I rather
think he will I did not like to say so before those panicmongers
outside who are stampeding everything so run along Barker boy and
ease your mind about the wife We may have other things to think about
soon

Thus adjured Barker rose from his halffinished breakfast and slipped
away Yet he was not quite certain what to do His wife must have heard
the news at Boomville as quickly as he had and if so would be on her
way with Mrs Horncastle or she might be waiting for himknowing too
that he had heard the newsin fear and trembling For it was Barkers
custom to endow all those he cared for with his own sensitiveness and
it was not like him to reflect that the woman who had so recklessly
speculated against his opinion would scarcely fear his reproaches in her
defeat In the fullness of his heart he telegraphed to her in case she
had not yet left Boomville All right Have heard news Understand
perfectly Dont worry Come to me Then he left the hotel by the
stable entrance in order to evade the guests who had congregated on
the veranda and made his way to a little wooded crest which he knew
commanded a view of the two roads from Boomville Here he determined to
wait and intercept her before she reached the hotel He knew that many
of the guests were aware of his wifes speculations with Van Loo and
that he was her broker He wished to spare her running the gauntlet
of their curious stares and comments as she drove up alone As he was
climbing the slope the coach from Sacramento dashed past him on the
road below but he knew that it had changed horses at Boomville at four
oclock and that his tired wife would not have availed herself of it at
that hour particularly as she could not have yet received the fateful
news He threw himself under a large pine and watched the stagecoach
disappear as it swept round into the courtyard of the hotel

He sat there for some moments with his eyes bent upon the two forks
of the red road that diverged below him but which appeared to become
whiter and more dazzling as he searched their distance There was
nothing to be seen except an occasional puff of dust which eventually
revealed a horseman or a long trailing cloud out of which a solitary
mule one of a packtrain of six or eight would momentarily emerge and
be lost again Then he suddenly heard his name called and looking up
saw Mrs Horncastle who had halted a few paces from him between two
columns of the longdrawn aisle of pines

In that mysterious halflight she seemed such a beautiful and
goddesslike figure that his consciousness at first was unable to grasp
anything else She was always wonderfully well dressed but the warmth
and seclusion of this mountain morning had enabled her to wear a light
gown of some delicate fabric which set off the grace of her figure
and even pardoned the rural coquetry of a silken sash around her still
slender waist An open white parasol thrown over her shoulder made
a nimbus for her charming head and the thick coils of hair under her
laceedged hat He had never seen her look so beautiful before And that
thought was so plainly in his frank face and eyes as he sprang to his
feet that it brought a slight rise of color to her own cheek

I saw you climbing up here as I passed in the coach a few minutes ago
she said with a smile and as soon as I had shaken the dust off I
followed you

Wheres Kitty he stammered

The color faded from her face as it had come and a shade of something
like reproach crept into her dark eyes And whatever it had been her
purpose to say or however carefully she might have prepared herself for
this interview she was evidently taken aback by the sudden directness
of the inquiry Barker saw this as quickly and as quickly referred it
to his own rudeness His whole soul rushed in apology to his face as he
said Oh forgive me I was anxious about Kitty indeed I had thought
of coming again to Boomville for youve heard the news of course Van
Loo is a defaulter and has run away with the poor childs money

Mrs Horncastle had heard the news at the hotel She paused a moment to
collect herself and then said slowly and tentatively with a watchful
intensity in her eyes Mrs Barker went I think to the Divide

But she was instantly interrupted by the eager Barker I see I thought
of that at once She went directly to the companys offices to see if
she could save anything from the wreck before she saw me It was like
her poor girl And youyou he went on eagerly his whole face
beaming with gratitudeyou out of your goodness came here to tell
me He held out both hands and took hers in his

For a moment Mrs Horncastle was speechless and vacillating She had
often noticed before that it was part of the irony of the creation of
such a simple nature as Barkers that he was not only open to deceit
but absolutely seemed to invite it Instead of making others franker
people were inclined to rebuke his credulity by restraint and
equivocation on their own part But the evasion thus offered to her
although only temporary was a temptation she could not resist And it
prolonged an interview that a ruthless revelation of the truth might
have shortened

She did not tell me she was going there she replied still evasively
and indeed she added with a burst of candor still more dangerous
I only learned it from the hotel clerk after she was gone But I want
to talk to you about her relations to Van Loo she said with a return
of her former intensity of gaze and I thought we would be less subject
to interruption here than at the hotel Only I suppose everybody knows
this place and any of those flirting couples are likely to come here
Besides she added with a little halfhysterical laugh and a slight
shiver as she looked up at the high interlacing boughs above her head
its as public as the aisles of a church and really one feels as if
one were speaking out in meeting Isnt there some other spot a little
more secluded where we could sit down she went on as she poked her
parasol into the usual black gunpowdery deposit of earth which mingled
with the carpet of pineneedles beneath her feet and not get all
sticky and dirty

Barkers eyes sparkled I know every foot of this hill Mrs
Horncastle he said and if you will follow me Ill take you to one of
the loveliest nooks you ever dreamed of Its an old Indian spring now
forgotten and I think known only to me and the birds Its not more
than ten minutes from here onlyhe hesitated as he caught sight
of the smart French bronze buckled shoe and silken ankle which
Mrs Horncastles gathering up of her dainty skirts around her had
disclosedit may be a little rough and dusty going to your feet

But Mrs Horncastle pointed out that she had already irretrievably
ruined her shoes and stockings in climbing up to himalthough Barker
could really distinguish no diminution of their freshnessand that
she might as well go on Whereat they both passed down the long aisle of
slope to a little hollow of manzanita which again opened to a view of
Black Spur but left the hotel hidden

What time did Kitty go began Barker eagerly when they were half down
the slope

But here Mrs Horncastles foot slipped upon the glassy pineneedles
and not only stopped an answer but obliged Barker to give all his
attention to keep his companion from falling again until they reached
the open Then came the plunge through the manzanita thicket then a
cool wade through waistdeep ferns and then they emerged holding each
others hand breathless and panting before the spring

It did not belie his enthusiastic description A triangular hollow
niched in a shelf of the mountainside narrowed to a point from which
the overflow of the spring percolated through a fringe of alder to
fall in what seemed from the valley to be a green furrow down the whole
length of the mountainside Overhung by pines above which met and
mingled with the willows that everywhere fringed it it made the one
cooling shade in the whole basking expanse of the mountain and yet was
penetrated throughout by the intoxicating spice of the heated pines
Flowering reeds and long lush grasses drew a magic circle round an open
bowllike pool in the centre that was always replenished to the slow
murmur of an unseen rivulet that trickled from a whitequartz cavern
in the mountainside like a vein opened in its flank Shadows of timid
wings crossed it quick rustlings disturbed the reeds but nothing more
It was silent but breathing it was hidden to everything but the sky
and the illimitable distance

They threaded their way around it on the spongy carpet covered by
delicate lacelike vines that seemed to caress rather than trammel their
moving feet until they reached an open space before the pool It was
cushioned and matted with disintegrated pine bark and here they sat
down Mrs Horncastle furled her parasol and laid it aside raised
both hands to the back of her head and took two hatpins out which she
placed in her smiling mouth removed her hat stuck the hatpins in it
and handed it to Barker who gently placed it on the top of a tall reed
where during the rest of that momentous meeting it swung and drooped
like a flower removed her gloves slowly drank still smilingly and
gratefully nearly a wineglassful of the water which Barker brought
her in the green twisted chalice of a lily leaf looked the picture of
happiness and then burst into tears

Barker was astounded dismayed even terrorstricken Mrs Horncastle
crying Mrs Horncastle the imperious the collected the coldly
critical the cynical smiling woman of the world actually crying
Other women might cryKitty had cried oftenbut Mrs Horncastle
Yet there she was sobbing actually sobbing like a schoolgirl
her beautiful shoulders rising and falling with her grief crying
unmistakably through her long white fingers through a lace
pockethandkerchief which she had hurriedly produced and shaken from
behind her like a conjurers trick her beautiful eyes a thousand times
more lustrous for the sparkling beads that brimmed her lashes and welled
over like the pool before her

Dont mind me she murmured behind her handkerchief Its very
foolish I know I was nervousworried I suppose Ill be better in a
moment Dont notice me please

But Barker had drawn beside her and was trying after the fashion of his
sex to take her handkerchief away in apparently the firm belief that
this action would stop her tears But tell me what it is Do Mrs
Horncastle please he pleaded in his boyish fashion Is it anything I
can do Only say the word only tell me SOMETHING

But he had succeeded in partially removing the handkerchief and so
caught a glimpse of her wet eyes in which a faint smile struggled out
like sunshine through rain But they clouded again although she didnt
cry and her breath came and went with the action of a sob and her
hands still remained against her flushed face

I was only going to talk to you of Kitty sobbut I suppose Im
weak soband such a fool sob and I got to thinking of myself
and my own sorrows when I ought to be thinking only of you and Kitty

Never mind Kitty said Barker impulsively Tell me about
yourselfyour own sorrows I am a brute to have bothered you about her
at such a moment and now until you have told me what is paining you so
I shall not let you speak of her He was perfectly sincere What
were Kittys possible and easy tears over the loss of her money to the
unknown agony that could wrench a sob from a woman like this Dear Mrs
Horncastle he went on as breathlessly think of me now not as Kittys
husband but as your true friend Yes as your BEST and TRUEST friend
and speak to me as you would speak to him

You will be my friend she said suddenly and passionately
grasping his hand my best and truest friend and if I tell you
alleverything you will not cast me from you and hate me

Barker felt the same thrill from her warm hand slowly possess his whole
being as it had the evening before but this time he was prepared and
answered the grasp and her eyes together as he said breathlessly I
will beI AM your friend

She withdrew her hand and passed it over her eyes After a moment she
caught his hand again and holding it tightly as if she feared he might
fly from her bit her lip and then slowly without looking at him
said I lied to you about myself and Kitty that night I did not come
with her I came alone and secretly to Boomville to seeto see the man
who is my husband

Your husband said Barker in surprise He had believed with the rest
of the world that there had been no communication between them for
years Yet so intense was his interest in her that he did not notice
that this revelation was leaving now no excuse for his wifes presence
at Boomville

Mrs Horncastle went on with dogged bitterness Yes my husband I went
to him to beg and bribe him to let me see my child Yes MY child she
said frantically tightening her hold upon his hand for I lied to you
when I once told you I had none I had a child and more than that a
child who at his birth I did not dare to openly claim

She stopped breathlessly stared at his face with her former intensity
as if she would pluck the thought that followed from his brain But
he only moved closer to her passed his arm over her shoulders with a
movement so natural and protecting that it had a certain dignity in it
and looking down upon her bent head with eyes brimming with sympathy
whispered Poor poor child

Whereat Mrs Horncastle again burst into tears And then with her head
half drawn towards his shoulder she told him allall that had passed
between her and her husbandeven all that they had then but hinted at
It was as if she felt she could now for the first time voice all these
terrible memories of the past which had come back to her last night when
her husband had left her She concealed nothing she veiled nothing
there were intervals when her tears no longer flowed and a cruel
hardness and return of her old imperiousness of voice and manner took
their place as if she was doing a rigid penance and took a bitter
satisfaction in laying bare her whole soul to him I never had a
friend she whispered there were women who persecuted me with their
jealous sneers there were men who persecuted me with their selfish
affections When I first saw YOU you seemed something so apart and
different from all other men that although I scarcely knew you I
wanted to tell you even then all that I have told you now I wanted
you to be my friend something told me that you couldthat you could
separate me from my past that you could tell me what to do that you
could make me think as you thought see life as YOU saw it and trust
always to some goodness in people as YOU did And in this faith I
thought that you would understand me now and even forgive me all

She made a slight movement as if to disengage his arm and possibly
to look into his eyes which she knew instinctively were bent upon her
downcast head But he only held her the more tightly until her cheek
was close against his breast What could I do she murmured A man
in sorrow and trouble may go to a woman for sympathy and support and the
world will not gainsay or misunderstand him But a womanweaker more
helpless credulous ignorant and craving for lightmust not in her
agony go to a man for succor and sympathy

Why should she not burst out Barker passionately releasing her in
his attempt to gaze into her face What man dare refuse her

Not THAT she said slowly but with still averted eyes but because
the world would say she LOVED him

And what should she care for the opinion of a world that stands aside
and lets her suffer Why should she heed its wretched babble he went
on in flashing indignation

Because she said faintly lifting her moist eyes and moist and parted
lips towards himbecause it would be TRUE

There was a silence so profound that even the spring seemed to withhold
its song as their eyes and lips met When the spring recommenced its
murmur and they could hear the droning of a bee above them and the
rustling of the reed she was murmuring too with her face against his
breast You did not think it strange that I should follow youthat I
should risk everything to tell you what I have told you before I told
you anything else You will never hate me for it George

There was another silence still more prolonged and when he looked again
into the flushed face and glistening eyes he was saying I have ALWAYS
loved you I know now I loved you from the first from the day when I
leaned over you to take little Sta from your lap and saw your tenderness
for him in your eyes I could have kissed you THEN dearest as I do
now

And she said when she had gained her smiling breath again you
will always remember George that you told me this BEFORE I told you
anything of her

HER Of whom dearest he asked leaning over her tenderly

Of Kittyof your wife she said impatiently as she drew back shyly
with her former intense gaze

He did not seem to grasp her meaning but said gravely Let us not
talk of her NOW Later we shall have MUCH to say of her For he added
quietly you know I must tell her all

The color faded from her cheek Tell her all she repeated vacantly
then suddenly she turned upon him eagerly and said But what if she is
gone

Gone he repeated

Yes gone What if she has run away with Van Loo What if she has
disgraced you and her child

What do you mean he said seizing both her hands and gazing at her
fixedly

I mean she said with a halffrightened eagerness that she has
already gone with Van Loo George George she burst out suddenly and
passionately falling upon her knees before him do you think that I
would have followed you here and told you what I did if I thought that
she had now the slightest claim upon your love or honor Dont you
understand me I came to tell you of her flight to Boomville with that
man how I accidentally intercepted them there how I tried to save her
from him and even lied to you to try to save her from your indignation
but how she deceived me as she has you and even escaped and joined her
lover while you were with me I came to tell you that and nothing more
George I swear it But when you were kind to me and pitied me I was
madwild I wanted to win you first out of your own love I wanted you
to respond to MINE before you knew your wife was faithless Yet I would
have saved her if I could Listen George A moment more before you
speak

Then she hurriedly told him all the whole story of his wifes dishonor
from her entrance into the sittingroom with Van Loo her later appeal
for concealment from her husbands unexpected presence to the use she
made of that concealment to fly with her lover She spared no detail
and even repeated the insult Mrs Barker had cast upon her with the
triumphant reproach that her husband would not believe her Perhaps
she added bitterly you may not believe me now I could even stand that
from you George if it could make you happier but you would still have
to believe it from others The people at the Boomville Hotel saw them
leave it together

I do believe you he said slowly but with downcast eyes and if I
did not love you before you told me this I could love you now for the
part you have taken butHe stopped

You love her still she burst out and I might have known it
Perhaps she went on distractedly you love her the more that you have
lost her It is the way of menand women

If I had loved her truly said Barker lifting his frank eyes to hers
I could not have touched YOUR lips I could not even have wished toas
I did three years agoas I did last night Then I feared it was my
weakness now I know it was my love I have thought of it ever since
even while waiting my wifes return here knowing that I did not and
never could have loved her But for that very reason I must try to save
her for her own sake if I cannot save her for mine and if I fail
dearest it shall not be said that we climbed to happiness over her
back bent with the burden of her shame If I loved you and told you so
thinking her still guiltless and innocent how could I profit now by her
fault

Mrs Horncastle saw too late her mistake Then you would take her
back she said frenziedly

To my homewhich is hersyes To my heartno She never was there

And I said Mrs Horncastle with a quivering lipwhere do I
go when you have settled this Back to my past again Back to my
husbandless childless life

She was turning away but Barker caught her in his arms again No
he said his whole face suddenly radiating with hope and youthful
enthusiasm No Kitty will help us we will tell her all You do not
know her dearest as I dohow good and kind she is in spite of all
We will appeal to her she will devise some means by which without the
scandal of a divorce she and I may be separated She will take dear
little Sta with herit is only right poor girl but she will let me
come and see him She will be a sister to us dearest Courage All will
come right yet Trust to me

An hysterical laugh came to Mrs Horncastles lips and then stopped
For as she looked up at him in his supreme hopefulness his divine
confidence in himself and othersat his handsome face beaming with
love and happiness and his clear gray eyes glittering with an almost
spiritual prescienceshe woman of the world and bitter experience
and perfectly cognizant of her own and Kittys possibilities was
nevertheless completely carried away by her lovers optimism For of
all optimism that of love is the most convincing Dear boyfor he was
but a boy in experienceonly his love for her could work this magic So
she gave him kiss for kiss largely believing largely hoping that Mrs
Barker was in love with Van Loo and would NOT return And in this hope
an invincible belief in the folly of her own sex soothed and sustained
her

We must go now dearest said Barker pointing to the sun already near
the meridian Three hours had fled they knew not how I will bring
you back to the hill again but there we had better separate you taking
your way alone to the hotel as you came and I will go a little way on
the road to the Divide and return later Keep your own counsel about
Kitty for her sake and ours perhaps no one else may know the truth
yet With a farewell kiss they plunged again hand in hand through the
cool bracken and again through the hot manzanita bushes and so parted
on the hilltop as they had never parted before leaving their whole
world behind them

Barker walked slowly along the road under the flickering shade of
wayside sycamore his sensitive face also alternating with his thought
in lights and shadows Presently there crept towards him out of the
distance a halting vacillating deviating buggy trailing a cloud of
dust after it like a broken wing As it came nearer he could see that
the horse was spent and exhausted and that the buggys sole occupanta
womanwas equally exhausted in her monotonous attempt to urge it
forward with whip and reins that rose and fell at intervals with feeble
reiteration Then he stepped out of the shadow and stood in the middle
of the sunlit road to await it For he recognized his wife

The buggy came nearer And then the most exquisite pang he had ever felt
before at his wifes hands shot through him For as she recognized
him she made a wild but impotent attempt to dash past him and then as
suddenly pulled up in the ditch

He went up to her She was dirty she was disheveled she was haggard
she was plain There were rings of dust round her tearswept eyes and
smudges of dustdried perspiration over her fair cheek He thought of
the beauty freshness and elegance of the woman he had just left and
an infinite pity swept the soul of this weakminded gentleman He ran
towards her and tenderly lifting her in her shamestained garments from
the buggy said hurriedly I know it all poor Kitty You heard the
news of Van Loos flight and you ran over to the Divide to try and save
some of your money Why didnt you wait Why didnt you tell me

There was no mistaking the reality of his words the genuine pity and
tenderness of his action but the woman saw before her only the familiar
dupe of her life and felt an infinite relief mingled with a certain
contempt for his weakness and anger at her previous fears of him

You might have driven over then yourself she said in a high
querulous voice if you knew it so well and have spared ME this
horrid dirty filthy hopeless expedition for I have not saved
anythingthere And I have had all this disgusting bother

For an instant he was sorely tempted to lift his eyes to her face but
he checked himself then he gently took her dustcoat from her shoulders
and shook it out wiped the dust from her face and eyes with his own
handkerchief held her hat and blew the dust from it with a vivid memory
of performing the same service for Mrs Horncastle only an hour before
while she arranged her hair and then lifting her again into the buggy
said quietly as he took his seat beside her and grasped the reins

I will drive you to the hotel by way of the stables and you can go
at once to your room and change your clothes You are tired you are
nervous and worried and want rest Dont tell me anything now until you
feel quite yourself again

He whipped up the horse who recognizing another hand at the reins
lunged forward in a final effort and in a few minutes they were at the
hotel

As Mrs Horncastle sat at luncheon in the great diningroom a little
pale and abstracted she saw Mrs Barker sweep confidently into the
room fresh rosy and in a new and ravishing toilette With a swift
glance of conscious power towards the other guests she walked towards
Mrs Horncastle Ah here you are dear she said in a voice that
could easily reach all ears and youve arrived only a little before
me after all And Ive had such an AWFUL drive to the Divide And only
think poor George telegraphed to me at Boomville not to worry and his
dispatch has only just come back here

And with a glance of complacency she laid Barkers gentle and forgiving
dispatch before the astonished Mrs Horncastle




CHAPTER VIII


As the day advanced the excitement over the financial crisis increased
at Hymettus until in spite of its remote and peaceful isolation
it seemed to throb through all its verandas and corridors with some
pulsation from the outer world Besides the letters and dispatches
brought by hurried messengers and by coach from the Divide there was
a crowd of guests and servants around the branch telegraph at the new
Heavy Tree postoffice which was constantly augmenting Added to the
natural anxiety of the deeply interested was the stimulated fever of the
few who wished to be in the fashion It was early rumored that a heavy
operator a guest of the hotel who was also a director in the telegraph
company had bought up the wires for his sole use that the dispatches
were doctored in his interests as a bear and there was wild talk
of lynching by the indignant mob Passengers from Sacramento San
Francisco and Marysville brought incredible news and the wildest
sensations Firm after firm had failed in the great cities Old
established houses that dated back to the spring of 49 and had
weathered the fires and inundations of their perilous Californian
infancy collapsed before this mysterious invisible impalpable
breath of panic Companies rooted in respectability and sneered at for
oldfashioned ways were discovered to have shamelessly speculated with
trusts An eminent deacon and pillar of the church was found dead in
his room with a bullet in his heart and a damning confession on the desk
before him Foreign bankers were sending their gold out of the country
government would be appealed to to open the vaults of the Mint there
would be an embargo on all bullion shipment Nothing was too wild or
preposterous to be repeated or credited

And with this fever of sordid passion the summer temperature had
increased For the last two weeks the thermometer had stood abnormally
high during the daylong sunshine and the metallic dust in the roads
over mineral ranges pricked the skin like redhot needles In the
deepest woods the aromatic sap stood in beads on felled logs and
splintered treeshafts even the mountain night breeze failed to cool
these baked and heated fastnesses There were ominous clouds of smoke by
day that were pillars of fire by night along the distant valleys Some
of the nearer crests were etched against the midnight sky by dull red
creeping lines like a dying firework The great hotel itself creaked
and crackled and warped though all its painted blistered and veneered
expanse and was filled with the stifling breath of desiccation The
stucco cracked and crumbled away from the cornices there were yawning
gaps in the boarded floors beneath the Turkey carpets Plateglass
windows became hopelessly fixed in their warped and twisted sashes
and added to the heat there was a warm incense of pine sap in the
diningroom that flavored all the cuisine And yet the babble of stocks
and shares went on and people pricked their ears over their soup to
catch the gossip of the last arrival

Demorest loathing it all in his newfound bitterness was nevertheless
impatient in his inaction and was eagerly awaiting a telegram from
Stacy Barker had disappeared since luncheon Suddenly there was
a commotion on the veranda as a carriage drove up with a handsome
grayhaired woman In the buzzing of voices around him Demorest heard
the name of Mrs Van Loo In further comments made in more smothered
accents he heard that Van Loo had been stopped at Canyon Station but
that no warrant had yet been issued against him that it was generally
believed that the bank dared not hold him that others openly averred
that he had been used as a scapegoat to avert suspicion from higher
guilt And certainly Mrs Van Loos calm confident air seemed to
corroborate these assertions

He was still wondering if the strange coincidence which had brought both
mother and son into his own life was not merely a fancy as far as SHE
was concerned when a waiter brought a message from Mrs Van Loo that
she would be glad to see him for a few moments in her room Last
night he could scarcely have restrained his eagerness to meet her and
elucidate the mystery of the photograph now he was conscious of an
equally strong revulsion of feeling and a dull premonition of evil
However it was no doubt possible that the man had told her of his
previous inquiries and she had merely acknowledged them by that
message

Demorest found Mrs Van Loo in the private sittingroom where he and his
old partners had supped on the preceding night She received him with
unmistakable courtesy and even a certain dignity that might or might
not have been assumed He had no difficulty in recognizing the sons
mechanical politeness in the first but he was puzzled at the second

The manager of this hotel she began with a foreigners precision of
English has just told me that you were at present occupying my rooms
at his invitation but that you wished to see me at once on my return
and I believe that I was not wrong in apprehending that you preferred
to hear my wishes from my own lips rather than from an innkeeper I had
intended to keep these rooms for some weeks but unfortunately for me
though fortunately for you the present terrible financial crisis which
has most unjustly brought my son into such scandalous prominence will
oblige me to return to San Francisco until his reputation is fully
cleared of these foul aspersions I shall only ask you to allow me the
undisturbed possession of these rooms for a couple of hours until I can
pack my trunks and gather up a few souvenirs that I almost always keep
with me

Pray consider that your wishes are my own in respect to that my
dear madam returned Demorest gravely and that indeed I protested
against even this temporary intrusion upon your apartments but I
confess that now that you have spoken of your souvenirs I have the
greatest curiosity about one of them and that even my object in seeking
this interview was to gratify it It is in regard to a photograph which
I saw on the chimneypiece in your bedroom which I think I recognized
as that of some one whom I formerly knew

There was a sudden look of sharp suspicion and even hard aggressiveness
that quite changed the ladys face as he mentioned the word souvenir
but it quickly changed to a smile as she put up her fan with a gesture
of arch deprecation and said

Ah I see Of course a ladys photograph

The reply irritated Demorest More than that he felt a sudden sense of
the absolute sentimentality of his request and the consciousness
that he was about to invite the familiar confidence of this strange
womanwhose son had forged his namein regard to HER

It was a Venetian picture he began and stopped a singular disgust
keeping him from voicing the name

But Mrs Van Loo was less reticent Oh you mean my dearest frienda
lovely picture and you know her Why yes surely You are THE Mr
Demorest whoOf course that old loveaffair Well you are a marvel
Five years ago at least and you have not forgotten I really must
write and tell her

Write and tell her Then it was all a lie about her death He felt
not only his faith his hope his future leaving him but even his
selfcontrol With an effort he said

I think you have already satisfied my curiosity I was told five years
ago that she was dead It was because of the date of the photographtwo
years laterthat I ventured to intrude upon you I was anxious only to
know the truth

She certainly was very much living and of the world when I saw her
last two years ago said Mrs Van Loo with an easy smile I dare say
that was a ruse of her relativesa very stupid oneto break off the
affair for I think they had other plans But dear me now I remember
was there not some little quarrel between you before Some letter from
you that was not very kind My impression is that there was something
of the sort and that the young lady was indignant But only for a time
you know She very soon forgot it I dare say if you wrote something
very charming to her it might not be too late We women are very
forgiving Mr Demorest and although she is very much sought after as
are all young American girls whose fathers can give them a comfortable
dot her parents might be persuaded to throw over a poor prince for
a rich countryman in the end Of course you know to you Republicans
there is always something fascinating in titles and blood and our dear
friend is like other girls Still it is worth the risk And five years
of waiting and devotion really ought to tell Its quite a romance
Shall I write to her and tell her I have seen you looking well and
prosperous Nothing more Do let me I should be delighted

I think it hardly worth while for you to give yourself that trouble
said Demorest quietly looking in Mrs Van Loos smiling eyes now that
I know the story of the young ladys death was a forgery And I will not
intrude further on your time Pray give yourself no needless hurry over
your packing I may go to San Francisco this afternoon and not even
require the rooms tonight

At least let me make you a present of the souvenir as an
acknowledgment of your courtesy said Mrs Van Loo passing into her
bedroom and returning with the photograph I feel that with your five
years of constancy it is more yours than mine As a gentleman Demorest
knew he could not refuse and taking the photograph from her with a low
bow with another final salutation he withdrew

Alone by himself in a corner of the veranda he was surprised that
the interview had made so little impression on him and had so little
altered his conviction His discovery that the announcement of his
betrotheds death was a fiction did not affect the fact that though
living she was yet dead to him and apparently by her own consent
The contrast between her life and his during those five years had been
covertly accented by Mrs Van Loo whether intentionally or not and
he saw again as last night the full extent of his sentimental folly He
could not even condole with himself that he was the victim of miserable
falsehoods that others had invented SHE had accepted them and had even
excused her desertion of him by that last deceit of the letter

He drew out her photograph and again examined it but not as a
lover Had she really grown stouter and more selfcomplacent Was the
spirituality and delicacy he had worshiped in her purely his own idiotic
fancy Had she always been like this Yes There was the girl who could
weakly strive weakly revenge herself and weakly forget There was the
figure that he had expected to find carved upon the tomb which he had
long sought that he might weep over He laughed aloud

It was very hot and he was stifling with inaction What was Barker
doing and why had not Stacy telegraphed to him And what were those
people in the courtyard doing Were they discussing news of further
disaster and ruin Perhaps he was even now a beggar Well his fortune
might go with his faith

But the crowd was simply looking at the roof of the hotel and he
now saw that a black smoke was drifting across the courtyard and was
conscious of a smell of soot and burning He stepped down from the
veranda among the mingled guests and servants and saw that the smoke
was only pouring from a chimney He heard too that the chimney had
been on fire and that it was Mrs Van Loos bedroom chimney and that
when the startled servants had knocked at the locked door she had told
them that she was only burning some old letters and newspapers the
refuse of her trunks There was naturally some indignation that the
hotel had been so foolishly endangered in such scorching weather and
the manager had had a scene with her which resulted in her leaving the
hotel indignantly with her halfpacked boxes But even after the smoke
had died away and the fire been extinguished in the chimney and hearth
there was an acrid smell of smouldering pine penetrating the upper
floors of the hotel all that afternoon

When Mrs Van Loo drove away the manager returned with Demorest to the
rooms The marble hearth was smoked and discolored and still littered
with charred ashes of burnt paper My belief is said the manager
darkly that the old hag came here just to burn up a lot of
incriminating papers that her son had intrusted to her keeping It looks
mighty suspicious You see she got up an awful lot of side when I told
her I didnt reckon to run a smelting furnace in a wooden hotel with the
thermometer at one hundred in the office and I reckon it was just an
excuse for getting off in a hurry

But the continued delay in Stacys promised telegram had begun to
work upon Demorests usual equanimity and he scarcely listened in his
anxiety for his old partner He knew that Stacy should have arrived in
San Francisco by noon He had almost determined to take the next train
from the Divide when two horsemen dashed into the courtyard There
was the usual stir on the veranda and rush for news but the two new
arrivals turned out to be Barker on a horse covered with foam and a
dashing elegantly dressed stranger on a mustang as carefully groomed
and as spotless as himself Demorest instantly recognized Jack Hamlin

He had not seen Hamlin since that day five years before when the
latter had accompanied the three partners with their treasure to
Boomville and had handed him the mysterious packet As the two men
dismounted hurriedly and moved towards him he felt a premonition of
something as fateful and important as then In obedience to a sign from
Barker he led them to a more secluded angle of the veranda He could not
help noticing that his younger partners face was mobile as ever but
more thoughtful and older yet his voice rang with the old freemasonry
of the camp as he said with a laugh The signal has been given and
its boot and saddle and away

But I have had no dispatch from Stacy said Demorest in surprise He
was to telegraph to me from San Francisco in any emergency

He never got there at all said Barker Jack ran slap into Van Loo at
the Divide and sent a dispatch to Jim which stopped him halfway until
Jack could reach him which he nearly broke his neck to do and then
Jack finished up by bringing a message from Stacy to us that we should
all meet together on the slope of Heavy Tree near the Bar I met Jack
just as I was riding into the Divide and came back with him He will
tell you the rest and you can swear by what Jack says for hes white
all through he added laying his hand affectionately on Hamlins
shoulder

Hamlin winced slightly For he had NOT told Barker that his wife was
with Van Loo nor his first reason for interfering But he related how
he had finally overtaken Van Loo at Canyon Station and how the fugitive
had disclosed the conspiracy of Steptoe and Hall against the bank and
Marshall as the price of his own release On this news remembering that
Stacy had passed the Divide on his way to the station he had first sent
a dispatch to him and then met him at the first station on the road
I reckon gentlemen said Hamlin with an unusual earnestness in his
voice that hed not only got my telegram but ALL THE NEWS that had
been flying around this morning for he looked like a man to whom it
was just a tossup whether he took his own life then and there or was
willing to have somebody else take it for him for he said Ill go
myself and telegraphed to have the surveyor stopped from coming Then
he told me to tell you fellows and ask you to come too Jack paused
and added half mischievously He sort of asked ME what I would take
to stand by him in the row if there was one and I told him Id
takewhiskey You see boys its a kind of offnight with me and
I wouldnt mind for the sake of old times to finish the game with old
Steptoe that I began a matter of five years ago

All right said Demorest with a kindling eye I suppose wed better
start at once One moment he added Barker boy will you excuse me if
I speak a word to Hamlin As Barker nodded and walked to the rails of
the veranda Demorest took Hamlin aside You and I he said hurriedly
are SINGLE men Barker has a wife and child This is likely to be no
childs play

But Jack Hamlin was no fool and from certain leading questions which
Barker had already put but which he had skillfully evaded he surmised
that Barker knew something of his wifes escapade He answered a little
more seriously than his wont I dont think as regards HIS WIFE that
would make much difference to him or her how stiff the work was

Demorest turned away with his last pang of bitterness It needed only
this confirmation of all that Stacy had hinted of what he himself had
seen in his brief interview with Mrs Barker since his return to shake
his last remaining faith Well all go together then he said with
a laugh as in the old times and perhaps its as well that we have no
woman in our confidence

An hour later the three men passed quietly out of the hotel scarcely
noticed by the other guests who were also oblivious of their absence
during the evening For Mrs Barker quite recovered from her fatiguing
ride was in high spirits and the most beautiful and spotless of summer
gowns and was considered quite a heroine by the other ladies as she
dwelt upon the terrible heat of her return journey Only I knew Mr
Barker would be worriedand the poor man actually walked a mile down
the Divide road to meet meI believe I should have stayed there all
day She glanced round the other groups for Mrs Horncastle but that
lady had retired early Possibly she alone had noticed the absence of
the two partners

The guests sat up until quite late for the heat seemed to grow still
more oppressive and the strange smell of burning wood revived the
gossip about Mrs Van Loo and her stupidity in setting fire to her
chimney Some averred that it would be days before the smell could be
got out of the house others referred it to the fires in the woods
which were now dangerously near One spoke of the isolated position
of the hotel as affording the greatest security but was met by the
assertion of a famous mountaineer that the forest fires were wont to
leap from crest to crest mysteriously without any apparent continuous
contact This led to more or less lighthearted conjecture of present
danger and some amusing stories of hotel fires and their ludicrous
revelations There were also some entertaining speculations as to what
they would do and what they would try to save in such an emergency

For myself said Mrs Barker audaciously I should certainly let Mr
Barker look after Sta and confine myself entirely to getting away with
my diamonds I know the wretch would never think of them

It was still later when exhausted by the heat and some reaction from
the excitement of the day they at last deserted the veranda for their
rooms and for a while the shadowy bulk of the whole building was picked
out with regularly spaced lights from its open windows until now these
finally faded and went out one by one An hour later the whole building
had sunk to rest It was said that it was only four in the morning when
a yawning porter having put out the light in a dark upper corridor
was amazed by a dull glow from the top of the wall and awoke to the
fact that a red fire as yet smokeless and flameless was creeping along
the cornice He ran to the office and gave the alarm but on returning
with assistance was stopped in the corridor by an impenetrable wall of
smoke veined with murky flashes The alarm was given in all the lower
floors and the occupants rushed from their beds half dressed to the
courtyard only to see as they afterwards averred the flames burst
like cannon discharges from the upper windows and unite above the
crackling roof So sudden and complete was the catastrophe although
slowly prepared by a leak in the overheated chimney between the floors
that even the excitement of fear and exertion was spared the survivors
There was bewilderment and stupor but neither uproar nor confusion
People found themselves wandering in the woods half awake and half
dressed having descended from the balconies and leaped from the
windowsthey knew not how Others on the upper floor neither awoke nor
moved from their beds but were suffocated without a cry From the first
an instinctive idea of the hopelessness of combating the conflagration
possessed them all to a blind automatic feeling to flee the building
was added the slow mechanism of the somnambulist delicate women walked
speechlessly but securely along ledges and roofs from which they
would have fallen by the mere light of reason and of day There was no
crowding or impeding haste in their dumb exodus It was only when Mrs
Barker awoke disheveled in the courtyard and with an hysterical outcry
rushed back into the hotel that there was any sign of panic

Mrs Horncastle who was standing near fully dressed as from some
nightlong vigil quickly followed her The halffrantic woman was
making directly for her own apartments whose windows those in
the courtyard could see were already belching smoke Suddenly Mrs
Horncastle stopped with a bitter cry and clasped her forehead It had
just flashed upon her that Mrs Barker had told her only a few hours
before that Sta had been removed with the nurse to the UPPER FLOOR It
was not the forgotten child that Mrs Barker was returning for but her
diamonds Mrs Horncastle called her she did not reply The smoke was
already pouring down the staircase Mrs Horncastle hesitated for a
moment only and then drawing a long breath dashed up the stairs On
the first landing she stumbled over somethingthe prostrate figure of
the nurse But this saved her for she found that near the floor she
could breathe more freely Before her appeared to be an open door She
crept along towards it on her hands and knees The frightened cry of
a child awakened from its sleep in the dark gave her nerve to rise
enter the room and dash open the window By the flashing light she
could see a little figure rising from a bed It was Sta There was not
a moment to be lost for the open window was beginning to draw the smoke
from the passage Luckily the boy by some childish instinct threw
his arms round her neck and left her hands free Whispering him to
hold tight she clambered out of the window A narrow ledge of cornice
scarcely wide enough for her feet ran along the house to a distant
balcony With her back to the house she zigzagged her feet along the
cornice to get away from the smoke which now poured directly from the
window Then she grew dizzy the weight of the child on her bosom seemed
to be toppling her forward towards the abyss below She closed her eyes
frantically grasping the child with crossed arms on her breast as she
stood on the ledge until as seen from below through the twisting
smoke they might have seemed a figure of the Madonna and Child niched
in the wall Then a voice from above called to her Courage and she
felt the flap of a twisted sheet lowered from an upper window against
her face She grasped it eagerly it held firmly Then she heard a cry
from below saw them carrying a ladder and at last was lifted with her
burden from the ledge by powerful hands Then only did she raise her
eyes to the upper window whence had come her help Smoke and flame were
pouring from it The unknown hero who had sacrificed his only chance of
escape to her remained forever unknown



Only four miles away that night a group of men were waiting for the dawn
in the shadow of a pine near Heavy Tree Bar As the sky glowed redly
over the crest between them and Hymettus Hamlin said

Another one of those forest fires Its this side of Black Spur and a
big one I reckon

Do you know said Barker thoughtfully I was thinking of the time
the old cabin burnt up on Heavy Tree It looks to be about in the same
place

Hush said Stacy sharply




CHAPTER IX


An abandoned tunnelan irregular orifice in the mountain flank which
looked like a driedup sewer that had disgorged through its opening the
refuse of the mountain in red slime gravel and a peculiar clay known
as cement in a foul streak down its side a narrow ledge on either
side broken up by heaps of quartz tailings and rock and half
hidden in scrub oak and myrtle a decaying cabin of logs bark and
cobblestonesthese made up the exterior of the Marshall claim To this
defacement of the mountain the rude clearing of thicket and underbrush
by fire or blasting the lopping of treeboughs and the decapitation
of saplings might be added the debris and ruins of halfcivilized
occupancy The ground before the cabin was covered with broken boxes
tin cans the staves and broken hoops of casks and the castoff rags
of blankets and clothing The whole claim in its unsavory unpicturesque
details and its vulgar story of sordid reckless and selfish occupancy
and abandonment was a foul blot on the landscape which the first rosy
dawn only made the more offending Surely the last spot in the world
that men should quarrel and fight for

So thought George Barker as with his companions they moved in single
file slowly towards it The little party consisted only of himself
Demorest and Stacy Marshall and Hamlinaccording to a prearranged
planwere still in ambush to join them at the first appearance of
Steptoe and his gang The claim was yet unoccupied they had secured
their first success Steptoes followers unaware that his design had
been discovered and confident that they could easily reach the claim
before Marshall and the surveyor had lingered Some of them had held
a drunken carouse at their rendezvous at Heavy Tree Others were still
engaged in procuring shovels and picks and pans for their mock equipment
as miners and this again gave Marshalls adherents the advantage
THEY knew that their opponents would probably first approach the
empty claim encumbered only with their peaceful implements while they
themselves had brought their rifles with them

Stacy who by tacit consent led the party on reaching the claim at
once posted Demorest and Barker each behind a separate heap of quartz
tailings on the ledge which afforded them a capital breastwork and
stationed himself at the mouth of the tunnel which was nearest the
trail It had already been arranged what each man was to do They were
in possession For the rest they must wait What they thought at
that moment no one knew Their characteristic appearance had slightly
changed The melancholy and philosophic Demorest was alert and bitter
Barkers changeful face had become fixed and steadfast Stacy alone wore
his fighting look which the others had remembered

They had not long to wait The sounds of rude laughter coarse
skylarking and voices more or less still confused with halfspent
liquor came from the rocky trail And then Steptoe appeared with part
of his straggling followers who were celebrating their easy invasion
by clattering their picks and shovels and beating loudly upon their tins
and prospectingpans The three partners quickly recognized the stamp
of the strangers in spite of their peaceful implements They were
the waifs and strays of San Francisco wharves of Sacramento dens of
dissolute mountain towns and there was not probably a single actual
miner among them A raging scorn and contempt took possession of Barker
and Demorest but Stacy knew their exact value As Steptoe passed before
the opening of the tunnel he heard the cry of Halt

He looked up He saw Stacy not thirty yards before him with his rifle
at halfcock He saw Barker and Demorest fully armed rise from behind
their breastworks of rock along the ledge and thus fully occupy the
claim But he saw more He saw that his plot was known Outlaw and
desperado as he was he saw that he had lost his moral power in this
actual possession and that from that moment he must be the aggressor
He saw he was fighting no irresponsible hirelings like his own but men
of position and importance whose loss would make a stir Against their
rifles the few revolvers that his men chanced to have slung to them
were of little avail But he was not cowed although his few followers
stumbled together at this momentary check half angrily half timorously
like wolves without a leader Bring up the other men and their guns
he whispered fiercely to the nearest Then he faced Stacy

Who are YOU to stop peaceful miners going to work on their own claim
he said coarsely Ill tell you WHO boys he added suddenly turning
to his men with a hoarse laugh It aint even the bank Its only Jim
Stacy that the bank kicked out yesterday to save itselfJim Stacy
and his brokendown pals And whats the thief doing herein Marshalls
tunnelthe only spot that Marshall can claim We aint no particular
friends o Marshalls though were neighbors on the same claim but we
aint going to see Marshall ousted by tramps Are we boys

No by Gd said his followers dropping the pans and seizing their
picks and revolvers They understood the appeal to arms if not to their
reason For an instant the fight seemed imminent Then a voice from
behind them said

You neednt trouble yourselves about that IM Marshall I sent these
gentlemen to occupy the claim until I came here with the surveyor and
two men stepped from a thicket of myrtle in the rear of Steptoe and
his followers The speaker Marshall was a thin slight overworked
overaged man his companion the surveyor was equally slight
but redbearded spectacled and professionallooking with a long
travelingduster that made him appear even clerical They were scarcely
a physical addition to Stacys party whatever might have been their
moral and legal support

But it was just this support that Steptoe strangely clung to in his
designs for the future and a wild idea seized him The surveyor was
really the only disinterested witness between the two parties If
Steptoe could confuse his mind before the actual fightingfrom which he
would of course escape as a noncombatantit would go far afterwards
to rehabilitate Steptoes party Very well then he said to Marshall
I shall call this gentleman to witness that we have been attacked
here in peaceable possession of our part of the claim by these armed
strangers and whether they are acting on your order or not their blood
will be on your head

Then I reckon said the surveyor as he tore away his beard wig
spectacles and mustache and revealed the figure of Jack Hamlin that
Im about the last witness that Mr SteptoeHorncastle ought to call
and about the last witness that he ever WILL call

But he had not calculated upon the desperation of Steptoe over the
failure of this last hope For there sprang up in the outlaws brain the
same hideous idea that he voiced to his companions at the Divide With
a hoarse cry to his followers he crashed his pickaxe into the brain of
Marshall who stood near him and sprang forward Three or four shots
were exchanged Two of his men fell a bullet from Stacys rifle pierced
Steptoes leg and he dropped forward on one knee He heard the steps
of his reinforcements with their weapons coming close behind him and
rolled aside on the sloping ledge to let them pass But he rolled too
far He felt himself slipping down the mountainside in the slimy shoot
of the tunnel He made a desperate attempt to recover himself but the
treacherous drift of the loose debris rolled with him as if he were
part of its refuse and carrying him down left him unconscious but
otherwise uninjured in the bushes of the second ledge five hundred feet
below

When he recovered his senses the shouts and outcries above him had
ceased He knew he was safe The ledge could only be reached by a
circuitous route three miles away He knew too that if he could only
reach a point of outcrop a hundred yards away he could easily descend to
the stage road down the gentle slope of the mountain hidden in a growth
of hazelbrush He bound up his wounded leg and dragged himself on his
hands and knees laboriously to the outcrop He did not look up since
his pick had crashed into Marshalls brain he had but one blind thought
before himto escape at once That his revenge and compensation would
come later he never doubted He limped and crept rolled and fell from
bush to bush through the sloping thickets until he saw the red road a
few feet below him

If he only had a horse he could put miles between him and any present
pursuit Why should he not have one The road was frequented by solitary
horsemenminers and Mexicans He had his revolver with him what
mattered the life of another man if he escaped from the consequences of
the one he had just taken He heard the clatter of hoofs two priests on
mules rode slowly by he ground his teeth with disappointment But they
had scarcely passed before another and more rapid clatter came from
their rear It was a lad on horseback He started It was his own son

He remembered in a flash how the boy had said he was coming to meet the
padre at the station on that day His first impulse was to hide himself
his wound and his defeat from the lad but the blind idea of escape
was still paramount He leaned over the bank and called to him The
astonished lad cantered eagerly to his side

Give me your horse Eddy said the father Im in bad luck and must
get

The boy glanced at his fathers face at his tattered garments and
bandaged leg and read the whole story It was a familiar page to him
He paled first and then flushed and then with an odd glitter in his
eyes said Take me with you father Do You always did before Ill
bring you luck

Desperation is superstitious Why not take him They had been lucky
before and the two together might confound any description of their
identity to the pursuers Help me up Eddy and then get up before me

BEHIND you mean said the boy with a laugh as he helped his father
into the saddle

No said Steptoe harshly BEFORE medo you hear And if anything
happens BEHIND you dont look If I drop off dont stop Dont get
down but go on and leave me Do you understand he repeated almost
savagely

Yes said the boy tremulously

All right said the father with a softer voice as he passed his one
arm round the boys body and lifted the reins Hold tight when we come
to the crossroads for well take the first turn for old lucks sake
to the Mission

They were the last words exchanged between them for as they wheeled
rapidly to the left at the crossroads Jack Hamlin and Demorest swung
as quickly out of another road to the right immediately behind them
Jacks challenge to Halt was only answered by Steptoes horse
springing forward under the sharp lash of the riata

Hold up said Jack suddenly laying his hand upon the rifle which
Demorest had lifted to his shoulder Hes carrying some onea wounded
comrade I reckon We dont want HIM Swing out and go for the horse
well forward in the neck or shoulder

Demorest swung far out to the right of the road and raised his rifle As
it cracked Steptoes horse seemed to have suddenly struck some obstacle
ahead of him rather than to have been hit himself for his head went
down with his fore feet under him and he turned a halfsomersault on
the road flinging his two riders a dozen feet away

Steptoe scrambled to his knees revolver in hand but the other figure
never moved Hands up said Jack sighting his own weapon The reports
seemed simultaneous but Jacks bullet had pierced Steptoes brain even
before the outlaws pistol exploded harmlessly in the air

The two men dismounted but by a common instinct they both ran to the
prostrate figure that had never moved

By God its a boy said Jack leaning over the body and lifting the
shoulders from which the head hung loosely Neck broken and dead as
his pal Suddenly he started and to Demorests astonishment began
hurriedly pulling off the glove from the boys limp right hand

What are you doing demanded Demorest in creeping horror

Look said Jack as he laid bare the small white hand The first two
fingers were merely unsightly stumps that had been hidden in the padded
glove

Good God Van Loos brother said Demorest recoiling

No said Jack with a grim face its what I have long
suspectedits Steptoes son

His son repeated Demorest

Yes said Jack and he added after looking at the two bodies with
a longdrawn whistle of concern and I wouldnt if I were you say
anything of this to Barker

Why said Demorest

Well returned Jack when our scrimmage was over down there and they
brought the news to Barker that his wife and her diamonds were burnt up
at the hotel you remember that they said that Mrs Horncastle had saved
his boy

Yes said Demorest but what has that to do with it

Nothing I reckon said Jack with a slight shrug of his shoulders
only Mrs Horncastle was the mother of the boy thats lying there



Two years later as Demorest and Stacy sat before the fire in the old
cabin on Marshalls claimnow legally their ownthey looked from the
door beyond the great bulk of Black Spur to the pallid snowline of the
Sierras still as remote and unchanged to them as when they had
gazed upon it from Heavy Tree Hill And for the matter of that they
themselves seemed to have been left so unchanged that even now as
in the old days it was Barkers voice as he greeted them from the
darkening trail that alone broke their reverie

Well said Demorest cheerfully your usual luck Barker boy for
they already saw in his face the happy light they had once seen there on
an eventful night seven years ago

Im to be married to Mrs Horncastle next month he said breathlessly
and little Sta loves her already as if she was his own mother Wish me
joy

A slight shadow passed over Stacys face but his hand was the first to
grasp Barkers and his voice the first to say Amen
