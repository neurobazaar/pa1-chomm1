Chapter I

Left Alone

The dreary March evening is rapidly passing from murky gloom to
obscurity Gusts of icy rain and sleet are sweeping full against a man
who though driving bows his head so low that he cannot see his
horses The patient beasts however plod along the miry road
unerringly taking their course to the distant stable door The highway
sometimes passes through a grove on the edge of a forest and the trees
creak and groan as they writhe in the heavy blasts In occasional
groups of pines there is sighing and moaning almost human in
suggestiveness of trouble Never had Nature been in a more dismal
mood never had she been more prodigal of every element of discomfort
and never had the hero of my story been more cast down in heart and
hope than on this chaotic day which even to his dull fancy appeared
closing in harmony with his feelings and fortune He is going home
yet the thought brings no assurance of welcome and comfort As he
cowers upon the seat of his market wagon he is to the reader what he
is in the fading lighta mere dim outline of a man His progress is
so slow that there will be plenty of time to relate some facts about
him which will make the scenes and events to follow more intelligible

James Holcroft is a middleaged man and the owner of a small hilly
farm He had inherited his rugged acres from his father had always
lived upon them and the feeling had grown strong with the lapse of
time that he could live nowhere else Yet he knew that he was in the
vernacular of the region going downhill The small savings of
years were slowly melting away and the depressing feature of this
truth was that he did not see how he could help himself He was not a
sanguine man but rather one endowed with a hard practical sense which
made it clear that the downhill process had only to continue
sufficiently long to leave him landless and penniless It was all so
distinct on this dismal evening that he groaned aloud

If it comes to that I dont know what Ill docrawl away on a night
like this and give up like enough

Perhaps he was right When a man with a nature like his gives up
the end has come The low sturdy oaks that grew so abundantly along
the road were types of his characterthey could break but not bend
He had little suppleness little power to adapt himself to varied
conditions of life An event had occurred a year since which for
months he could only contemplate with dull wonder and dismay In his
youth he had married the daughter of a small farmer Like himself she
had always been accustomed to toil and frugal living From childhood
she had been impressed with the thought that parting with a dollar was
a serious matter and to save a dollar one of the good deeds rewarded
in this life and the life to come She and her husband were in
complete harmony on this vital point Yet not a miserly trait entered
into their humble thrift It was a necessity entailed by their meager
resources it was inspired by the wish for an honest independence in
their old age

There was to be no old age for her She took a heavy cold and almost
before her husband was aware of her danger she had left his side He
was more than griefstricken he was appalled No children had blessed
their union and they had become more and more to each other in their
simple home life To many it would have seemed a narrow and even a
sordid life It could not have been the latter for all their hard
work their petty economies and plans to increase the hoard in the
savings bank were robbed of sordidness by an honest quiet affection
for each other by mutual sympathy and a common purpose It
undoubtedly was a meager life which grew narrower with time and habit
There had never been much romance to begin with but something that
often wears bettermutual respect and affection From the first
James Holcroft had entertained the sensible hope that she was just the
girl to help him make a living from his hillside farm and he had not
hoped for or even thought of very much else except the harmony and good
comradeship which bless people who are suited to each other He had
been disappointed in no respect they had toiled and gathered like
ants they were confidential partners in the homely business and
details of the farm nothing was wasted not even time The little
farmhouse abounded in comfort and was a model of neatness and order
If it and its surroundings were devoid of grace and ornament they were
not missed for neither of its occupants had ever been accustomed to
such things The years which passed so uneventfully only cemented the
union and increased the sense of mutual dependence They would have
been regarded as exceedingly matteroffact and undemonstrative but
they were kind to each other and understood each other Feeling that
they were slowly yet surely getting ahead they looked forward to an
old age of rest and a sufficiency for their simple needs Then before
he could realize the truth he was left alone at her wintry grave
neighbors dispersed after the brief service and he plodded back to his
desolate home There was no relative to step in and partially make
good his loss Some of the nearest residents sent a few cooked
provisions until he could get help but these attentions soon ceased
It was believed that he was abundantly able to take care of himself
and he was left to do so He was not exactly unpopular but had been
much too reticent and had lived too secluded a life to find uninvited
sympathy now He was the last man however to ask for sympathy or
help and this was not due to misanthropy but simply to temperament
and habits of life He and his wife had been sufficient for each
other and the outside world was excluded chiefly because they had not
time or taste for social interchanges As a result he suffered
serious disadvantages he was misunderstood and virtually left to meet
his calamity alone

But indeed he could scarcely have met it in any other way Even to
his wife he had never formed the habit of speaking freely of his
thoughts and feelings There had been no need so complete was the
understanding between them A hint a sentence reveled to each other
their simple and limited processes of thought To talk about her now
to strangers was impossible He had no language by which to express
the heavy paralyzing pain in his heart

For a time he performed necessary duties in a dazed mechanical way
The horses and live stock were fed regularly the cows milked but the
milk stood in the dairy room until it spoiled Then he would sit down
at his desolate hearth and gaze for hours into the fire until it sunk
down and died out Perhaps no class in the world suffers from such a
terrible sense of loneliness as simplenatured country people to whom
a very few have been all the company they required

At last Holcroft partially shook off his stupor and began the
experiment of keeping house and maintaining his dairy with hired help
For a long year he had struggled on through all kinds of domestic
vicissitude conscious all the time that things were going from bad to
worse His house was isolated the region sparsely settled and good
help difficult to be obtained under favoring auspices The few
respectable women in the neighborhood who occasionally lent a hand in
other homes than their own would not compromise themselves as they
expressed it by keepin house for a widower Servants obtained from
the neighboring town either could not endure the loneliness or else
were so wasteful and ignorant that the farmer in sheer desperation
discharged them The silent griefstricken ruggedfeatured man was
no company for anyone The year was but a record of changes waste
and small pilferings Although he knew he could not afford it he tried
the device of obtaining two women instead of one so that they might
have society in each other but either they would not stay or else he
found that he had two thieves to deal with instead of onebrazen
incompetent creatures who knew more about whisky than milk and who
made his home a terror to him

Some asked goodnaturedly Why dont you marry again Not only was
the very thought repugnant but he knew well that he was not the man to
thrive on any such errand to the neighboring farmhouses Though
apparently he had little sentiment in his nature yet the memory of his
wife was like his religion He felt that he could not put an ordinary
woman into his wifes place and say to her the words he had spoken
before Such a marriage would be to him a grotesque farce at which
his soul revolted

At last he was driven to the necessity of applying for help to an Irish
family that had recently moved into the neighborhood The promise was
forbidding indeed as he entered the squalid abode in which were
huddled men women and children A sister of the mistress of the
shanty was voluble in her assurances of unlimited capability

Faix I kin do all the wourk in doors and out so I takes the notion
she had asserted

There certainly was no lack of bone and muscle in the big redfaced
middleaged woman who was so ready to preside at his hearth and glean
from his diminished dairy a modicum of profit but as he trudged home
along the wintry road he experienced strong feelings of disgust at the
thought of such a creature sitting by the kitchen fire in the place
once occupied by his wife

During all these domestic vicissitudes he had occupied the parlor a
stiff formal frigid apartment which had been rarely used in his
married life He had no inclination for the society of his help in
fact there had been none with whom he could associate The better
class of those who went out to service could find places much more to
their taste than the lonely farmhouse The kitchen had been the one
cozy cheerful room of the house and driven from it the farmer was
an exile in his own home In the parlor he could at least brood over
the happy past and that was about all the solace he had left

Bridget came and took possession of her domain with a sangfroid which
appalled Holcroft from the first To his directions and suggestions
she curtly informed him that she knew her business and didnt want no
mon around orderin and interferin

In fact she did appear as she had said capable of any amount of
work and usually was in a mood to perform it but soon her male
relatives began to drop in to smoke a pipe with her in the evening A
little later on the supper table was left standing for those who were
always ready to take a biteThe farmer had never heard of the camel
who first got his head into the tent but it gradually dawned upon him
that he was half supporting the whole Irish tribe down at the shanty
Every evening while he shivered in his best room he was compelled to
hear the coarse jests and laughter in the adjacent apartment One night
his bitter thoughts found expression I might as well open a free
house for the keeping of man and beast

He had endured this state of affairs for some time simply because the
woman did the essential work in her offhand slapdash style and left
him unmolested to his brooding as long as he did not interfere with her
ideas of domestic economy But his impatience and the sense of being
wronged were producing a feeling akin to desperation Every week there
was less and less to sell from the dairy chickens and eggs
disappeared and the appetites of those who dropped in to kape Bridgy
from bein a bit lonely grew more voracious

Thus matters had drifted on until this March day when he had taken two
calves to market He had said to the kitchen potentate that he would
take supper with a friend in town and therefore would not be back
before nine in the evening This friend was the official keeper of the
poorhouse and had been a crony of Holcrofts in early life He had
taken to politics instead of farming and now had attained to what he
and his acquaintances spoke of as a snug berth Holcroft had
maintained with this man a friendship based partly on business
relations and the welltodo purveyor for paupers always gave his old
playmate an honest welcome to his private supper table which differed
somewhat from that spread for the towns pensioners

On this occasion the gathering storm had decided Holcroft to return
without availing himself of his friends hospitality and he is at last
entering the lane leading from the highway to his doorway Even as he
approaches his dwelling he hears the sound of revelry and readily
guesses what is taking place

Quiet patient men when goaded beyond a certain point are capable of
terrible ebullitions of anger and Holcroft was no exception It
seemed to him that night that the God he had worshiped all his life was
in league with man against him The blood rushed to his face his
chilled form became rigid with a sudden passionate protest against his
misfortunes and wrongs Springing from the wagon he left his team
standing at the barn door and rushed to the kitchen window There
before him sat the whole tribe from the shanty feasting at his
expense The table was loaded with coarse profusion Roast fowls
alternated with fried ham and eggs a great pitcher of milk was flanked
by one of foaming cider while the post of honor was occupied by the
one contribution of his selfinvited guestsa villainouslooking jug

They had just sat down to the repast when the weazenfaced patriarch of
the tribe remarked by way of grace it may be supposed Be jabers
but isnt ould Holcroft givin us a foine spread the noight Heres
bad luck to the glowerin ould skinflint and he poured out a bumper
from the jug

The farmer waited to see and hear no more Hastening to a parlor
window he raised it quietly and clambered in then taking his rusty
shotgun which he kept loaded for the benefit of the vermin that
prowled about his henroost he burst in upon the startled group

Be off he shouted If you value your lives get out of that door
and never show your faces on my place again Ill not be eaten out of
house and home by a lot of jackals

His weapon his dark gleaming eyes and desperate aspect taught the
men that he was not to be trifled with a moment and they slunk away

Bridget began to whine Yez wouldnt turn a woman out in the noight
and storm

You are not a woman thundered Holcroft you are a jackal too Get
your traps and begone I warn the whole lot of you to beware I give
you this chance to get off the premises and then I shall watch for you
all old and young

There was something terrible and flamelike in his anger dismaying the
cormorants and they hastened away with such alacrity that Bridget went
down the lane screaming Sthop I tell yees and be afther waitin for
me

Holcroft hurled the jug after them with words that sounded like an
imprecation He next turned to the viands on the table with an
expression of loathing gathered them up and carried them to the hog
pen He seemed possessed by a feverish impatience to banish every
vestige of those whom he had driven forth and to restore the apartment
as nearly as possible to the aspect it had worn in former happy years
At last he sat down where his wife had been accustomed to sit
unbuttoned his waistcoat and flannel shirt and from against his naked
breast took an old worn daguerreotype He looked a moment at the
plain good face reflected there them bowing his head upon it
strong convulsive sobs shook his frame though not a tear moistened
his eyes

How long the paroxysm would have lasted it were hard to say had not
the impatient whinnying of his horses still exposed to the storm
caught his attention The lifelong habit of caring for the dumb
animals in his charge asserted itself He went out mechanically
unharnessed and stabled them as carefully as ever before in his life
then returned and wearily prepared himself a pot of coffee which with
a crust of bread was all the supper he appeared to crave



Chapter II

A Very Interested Friend

For the next few days Holcroft lived alone The weather remained
inclement and there was no occasion for him to go farther away than the
barn and outbuildings He felt that a crisis in his life was
approaching that he would probably be compelled to sell his property
for what it would bring and begin life again under different auspices

I must either sell or marry he groaned and ones about as hard and
bad as the other Wholl buy the place and stock at half what theyre
worth and where could I find a woman that would look at an old fellow
like me even if I could bring myself to look at her

The poor man did indeed feel that he was shut up to dreadful
alternatives With his ignorance of the world and dislike for contact
with strangers selling out and going away was virtually starting out
on an unknown sea without rudder or compass It was worse than
thatit was the tearing up of a life that had rooted itself in the
soil whereon he had been content from childhood to middle age He
would suffer more in going and in the memory of what he had parted
with than in any of the vicissitudes which might overtake him He had
not much range of imagination or feeling but within his limitations
his emotions were strong and his convictions unwavering Still he
thought it might be possible to live in some vague unknown place
doing some kind of work for people with whom he need not have very much
to do Ive always been my own master and done things in my own way
he muttered but I suppose I could farm it to suit some old quiet
people if I could only find em One thing is certain anyhowI
couldnt stay here in Oakville and see another man living in these
rooms and plowing my fields and driving his cows to my old pasture
lots That would finish me like a galloping consumption

Every day he shrunk with a strange dread from the wrench of parting
with the familiar place and with all that he associated with his wife
This was really the ordeal which shook his soul and not the fear that
he would be unable to earn his bread elsewhere The unstable
multitude who are forever fancying that they would be better off
somewhere else or at something else can have no comprehension of this
deeprooted love of locality and the binding power of long association
They regard such men as Holcroft as little better than plodding oxen
The highest tribute which some people can pay to a man however is to
show that they do not and cannot understand him But the farmer was
quite indifferent whether he was understood or not He gave no thought
to what people said or might say What were people to him He only
had a hunted pathetic sense of being hedged in and driven to bay
Even to his neighbors there was more of the humorous than the tragic
in his plight It was supposed that he had a goodly sum in the bank
and gossips said that he and his wife thought more of increasing this
hoard than of each other and that old Holcrofts mourning was chiefly
for a business partner His domestic tribulations evoked mirth rather
than sympathy and as the news spread from farmhouse to cottage of his
summary bundling of Bridget and her satellites out of doors there were
both hilarity and satisfaction

While there was little commiseration for the farmer there was decided
disapprobation of the dishonest Irish tribe and all were glad that the
gang had received a lesson which might restrain them from preying upon
others

Holcroft was partly to blame for his present isolation Remote rural
populations are given to strong prejudices especially against those
who are thought to be welloff from an oversaving spirit and who
worse still are unsocial Almost anything will be forgiven sooner
than thinking ones self better than the other folks and that is the
usual interpretation of shy reticent people But there had been a
decided tinge of selfishness in the Holcrofts habit of seclusion for
it became a habit rather than a principle While they cherished no
active dislike to their neighbors or sense of superiority these were
not wholly astray in believing that they had little place in the
thoughts or interests of the occupants of the hill farm Indifference
begat indifference and now the lonely helpless man had neither the
power nor the disposition to bridge the chasm which separated him from
those who might have given him kindly and intelligent aid He was
making a pathetic effort to keep his home and to prevent his heart from
being torn bleeding away from all it loved His neighbors thought that
he was merely exerting himself to keep the dollars which it had been
the supreme motive of his life to accumulate

Giving no thought to the opinions of others Holcroft only knew that he
was in sore straitsthat all which made his existence a blessing was
at stake

At times during these lonely and stormy March days he would dismiss
his anxious speculations in regard to his future course He was so
morbid especially at night that he felt that his wife could revisit
the quiet house He cherished the hope that she could see him and hear
what he said and he spoke in her viewless presence with a freedom and
fullness that was unlike his old reticence and habit of repression He
wondered that he had not said more endearing words and given her
stronger assurance of how much she was to him Late at night he would
start out of a long reverie take a candle and going through the
house would touch what she had touched and look long and fixedly at
things associated with her Her gowns still hung in the closet just
as she had left them he would take them out and recall the
wellremembered scenes and occasions when they were worn At such
times she almost seemed beside him and he had a consciousness of
companionship which soothed his perturbed spirit He felt that she
appreciated such loving remembrance although unable to express her
approval He did not know it but his nature was being softened
deepened and enriched by these deep and unwonted experiences the hard
materiality of his life was passing away rendering him capable of
something better than he had ever known

In the morning all the old prosaic problems of his life would return
with their hard practical insistence and he knew that he must decide
upon something very soon His lonely vigils and days of quiet had
brought him to the conclusion that he could not hunt up a wife as a
matter of business He would rather face the ever angry bears than
breathe the subject of matrimony to any woman that he could ever
imagine himself marrying He was therefore steadily drifting toward
the necessity of selling everything and going away This event
however was like a coral reef to a sailor with no land in view beyond
it The only thing which seemed certain was the general breaking up of
all that had hitherto made his life

The offer of help came from an unexpected source One morning Holcroft
received a call from a neighbor who had never before shown any interest
in his affairs On this occasion however Mr Weeks began to display
so much solicitude that the farmer was not only surprised but also a
little distrustful Nothing in his previous knowledge of the man had
prepared the way for such very kindly intervention

After some general references to the past Mr Weeks continued Ive
been saying to our folks that it was too bad to let you worry on alone
without more neighborly help You ought either to get married or have
some thoroughly respectable and wellknown middleaged woman keep house
for you That would stop all talk and theres been a heap of it I
can tell you Of course I and my folks dont believe anythings been
wrong

Believing that something was wrong is about all the attention my
neighbors have given me as far as I can see Holcroft remarked
bitterly

Well you see Holcroft youve kept yourself so inside your shell
that people dont know what to believe Now the thing to do is to
change all that I know how hard it is for a man placed as you be to
get decent help My wife was awondering about it the other day and I
shut her up mighty sudden by saying Youre a good manager and know
all the country side yet how often youre acomplaining that you cant
get a girl thats worth her salt to help in haying and other busy times
when we have to board a lot of men Well I wont beat around the bush
any more Ive come to act the part of a good neighbor Theres no
use of youre trying to get along with such haphazard help as you can
pick up here and in town You want a respectable woman for
housekeeper and then have a cheap common sort of a girl to work under
her Now I know of just such a woman and its not unlikely shed be
persuaded to take entire charge of your house and dairy My wifes
cousin Mrs Mumpson At the mention of this name Holcroft gave a
slight start feeling something like a cold chill run down his back

Mr Weeks was a little disconcerted but resumed I believe she called
on your wife once

Yes the farmer replied laconically I was away and did not see her

Well now pursued Mr Weeks shes a good soul She has her little
peculiarities so have you and me a lot of em but shes thoroughly
respectable and there isnt a man or woman in the town that would
think of saying a word against her She has only one child a nice
quiet little girl whod be company for her mother and make everything
look right you know

I dont see what theres been to look wrong growled the farmer

Nothing to me and my folks of course or I wouldnt suggest the idea
of a relation of my wife coming to live with you But you see people
will talk unless you stop their mouths so theyll feel like fools in
doing it I know yours has been a mighty awkward case and heres a
plain way out of it You can set yourself right and have everything
looked after as it ought to be in twentyfour hours Weve talked to
Cynthythats Mrs Mumpsonand she takes a sight of interest Shed
do well by you and straighten things out and you might do a plaguey
sight worse than give her the right to take care of your indoor affairs
for life

I dont expect to marry again said Holcroft curtly

Oh well Many a man and woman has said that and believed it too at
the time Im not saying that my wifes cousin is inclined that way
herself Like enough she isnt at all but then the right kind of
persuading does change womens minds sometimes eh Mrs Mumpson is
kinder alone in the world like yourself and if she was sure of a good
home and a kind husband theres no telling what good luck might happen
to you But therell be plenty of time for considering all that on
both sides You cant live like a hermit

I was thinking of selling out and leaving these parts Holcroft
interrupted

Now look here neighbor you know as well as I do that in these times
you couldnt give away the place Whats the use of such foolishness
The thing to do is to keep the farm and get a good living out of it
Youve got down in the dumps and cant see whats sensible and to your
own advantage

Holcroft was thinking deeply and he turned his eyes wistfully to the
upland slopes of his farm Mr Weeks had talked plausibly and if all
had been as he represented the plan would not have been a bad one
But the widower did not yearn for the widow He did not know much
about her but had very unfavorable impressions Mrs Holcroft had not
been given to speaking ill of anyone but she had always shaken her
head with a peculiar significance when Mrs Mumpsons name was
mentioned

The widow had felt it her duty to call and counsel against the sin of
seclusion and being too much absorbed in the affairs of this world

You should take an interest in everyone this selfappointed
evangelist had declared and in one sense she lived up to her creed
She permitted no scrap of information about people to escape her and
was not only versed in all the gossip of Oakville but also of several
other localities in which she visited

But Holcroft had little else to deter him from employing her services
beyond an unfavorable impression She could not be so bad as Bridget
Malony and he was almost willing to employ her again for the privilege
of remaining on his paternal acres As to marrying the widowa slight
shudder passed through his frame at the thought

Slowly he began as if almost thinking aloud I suppose you are right
Lemuel Weeks in what you say about selling the place The Lord knows
I dont want to leave it I was born and brought up here and that
counts with some people If your wifes cousin is willing to come and
help me make a living for such wages as I can pay the arrangement
might be made But I want to look on it as a business arrangement I
have quiet ways of my own and things belonging to the past to think
about and Ive got a right to think about em I aint one of the
marrying kind and I dont want people to be aconsidering such notions
when I dont Id be kind and all that to her and her little girl but
I should want to be left to myself as far as I could be

Oh certainly said Mr Weeks mentally chuckling over the slight
prospect of such immunity but you must remember that Mrs Mumpson
isnt like common help

Thats where the trouble will come in ejaculated the perplexed
farmer but theres been trouble enough with the other sort

I should say so Mr Weeks remarked emphatically It would be a pity
if you couldnt get along with such a respectable conscientious woman
as Mrs Mumpson who comes from one of the best families in the
country

Holcroft removed his hat and passed his hand over his brow wearily as
he said Oh I could get along with anyone who would do the work in a
way that would give me a chance to make a little and then leave me to
myself

Well well said Mr Weeks laughing you neednt think that because
Ive hinted at a good match for you Im making one for my wifes
cousin You may see the day when youll be more hot for it than she
is All Im trying to do is to help you keep your place and live like
a man ought and stop peoples mouths

If I could only fill my own and live in peace its all I ask When I
get to plowing and planting again Ill begin to take some comfort

These words were quoted against Holcroft far and near Filling his
own mouth and making a little money are all he cares for was the
general verdict And thus people are misunderstood The farmer had
never turned anyone hungry from his door and he would have gone to the
poorhouse rather than have acted the part of the man who misrepresented
him He had only meant to express the hope that he might be able to
fill his mouthearn his bread and get it from his native soil
Plowing and plantingworking where he had toiled since a
childwould be a solace in itself and not a grudged means to a sordid
end

Mr Weeks was a thrifty man also and in nothing was he more economical
than in charitable views of his neighbors motives and conduct He
drove homeward with the complacent feeling that he had done a shrewd
good thing for himself and his folks at least His wifes cousin was
not exactly embraced in the latter category although he had been so
active in her behalf The fact was he would be at much greater pains
could he attach her to Holcroft or anyone else and so prevent further
periodical visits

He regarded her and her child as barnacles with such appalling adhesive
powers that even his ingenuity at crowding out had been baffled In
justice to him it must be admitted that Mrs Mumpson was a type of the
poor relation that would tax the long suffering of charity itself Her
husband had left her scarcely his blessing and if he had fled to ills
he knew not of he believed that he was escaping from some of which he
had a painfully distinct consciousness His widow was one of the
people who regard the world as their oyster and her scheme of life
was to get as much as possible for nothing Arrayed in mourning weeds
she had begun a system of periodical descents upon his relatives and
her own She might have made such visitations endurable and even
welcome but she was not shrewd enough to be sensible She appeared to
have developed only the capacity to talk to pry and to worry people
She was unable to rest or to permit others to rest yet her aversion to
any useful form of activity was her chief characteristic Wherever she
went she took the ground that she was company and with a shawl
hanging over her sharp angular shoulders she would seize upon the
most comfortable rocking chair in the house and mouse for bits of news
about everyone of whom she had ever heard She was quite as ready to
tell all she knew also and for the sake of her budget of gossip and
small scandal her female relatives tolerated her after a fashion for a
time but she had been around so often and her scheme of obtaining
subsistence for herself and child had become so offensively apparent
that she had about exhausted the patience of all the kith and kin on
whom she had the remotest claim Her presence was all the more
unwelcome by reason of the faculty for irritating the men of the
various households which she invaded Even the most phlegmatic or the
bestnatured lost their selfcontrol and as their wives declared
felt like flying all to pieces at her incessant rocking gossiping
questioning and what was worse still lecturing Not the least
endurable thing about Mrs Mumpson was her peculiar phase of piety
She saw the delinquencies and duties of others with such painful
distinctness that she felt compelled to speak of them and her zeal was
sure to be instant out of season

When Mr Weeks had started on his ominous mission to Holcroft his wife
remarked to her daughter confidentially I declare sis if we dont
get rid of Cynthy soon I believe Lemuel will fly off the handle

To avoid any such dire catastrophe it was hoped and almost prayed in
the Weeks household that the lonely occupant of the hill farm would
take the widow for good and all



Chapter III

Mrs Mumpson Negotiates and Yields

Mr Weeks on his return home dropped all diplomacy in dealing with
the question at issue Cynthy he said in his own vernacular the
end has come so far as me and my folks are concernedI never expect
to visit you and while Im master of the house no more visits will be
received But I haint taken any such stand onconsiderately he
concluded Ive given up the whole forenoon to secure you a better
chance of living than visiting around If you go to Holcrofts youll
have to do some work and so will your girl But hell hire someone to
help you and so you wont have to hurt yourself Your trump card will
be to hook him and marry him before he finds you out To do this
youll have to see to the house and dairy and bestir yourself for a
time at least Hes pretty desperate off for lack of women folks to
look after indoor matters but hell sell out and clear out before
hell keep a woman much less marry her if she does nothing but talk
Now remember youve got a chance which you wont get again for
Holcroft not only owns his farm but has a snug sum in the bank So
you had better get your things together and go right over while hes
in the mood

When Mrs Mumpson reached the blank wall of the inevitable she
yielded and not before She saw that the Weeks mine was worked out
completely and she knew that this exhaustion was about equally true of
all similar mines which had been bored until they would yield no
further returns

But Mr Weeks soon found that he could not carry out his summary
measures The widow was bent on negotiations and binding agreements
In a stiff cramped hand she wrote to Holcroft in regard to the amount
of salary he would be willing to pay intimating that one burdened
with such responsibilities as she was expected to assume ort to be
compensiated proposhundly

Weeks groaned as he dispatched his son on horseback with this first
epistle and Holcroft groaned as he read it not on account of its
marvelous spelling and construction but by reason of the vista of
perplexities and trouble it opened to his boding mind But he named on
half a sheet of paper as large a sum as he felt it possible to pay and
leave any chance for himself then affixed his signature and sent it
back by the messenger

The widow Mumpson wished to talk over this first point between the high
contracting powers indefinitely but Mr Weeks remarked cynically
Its double what I thought hed offer and youre lucky to have it in
black and white Now that everythings settled Timothy will hitch up
and take you and Jane up there at once

But Mrs Mumpson now began to insist upon writing another letter in
regard to her domestic status and that of her child They could not
think of being looked upon as servants She also wished to be assured
that a girl would be hired to help her that she should have all the
church privileges to which she had been accustomed and the right to
visit and entertain her friends which meant every farmers wife and
all the maiden sisters in Oakville And then she continued there
are always little perquisites which a housekeeper has a right to look
for Mr Weeks irritably put a period to this phase of diplomacy by
saying Well well Cynthy the stage will be along in a couple of
hours Well put you and your things aboard and you can go on with
what you call your negotiations at Cousin Abirams I can tell you one
thing thoughif you write any such letter to Holcroft youll never
hear from him again

Compelled to give up all these preliminaries but inwardly resolving to
gain each point by a nagging persistence of which she was a mistress
she finally declared that she must have writings about one thing which
couldnt be left to any mans changeful mind He must agree to give me
the monthly salary he names for at least a year

Weeks thought a moment and then with a shrewd twinkle in his eyes
admitted It would be a good thing to have Holcrofts name to such an
agreement Yes you might try that on but youre taking a risk If
you were not so pennywise and poundfoolish youd go at once and
manage to get him to take you for better or worse

Youmisjudge me Cousin Lemuel replied the widow bridling and
rocking violently If theres any such taking to be done he must get
me to take him

Well well write your letter about a years engagement Thatll
settle you for a twelvemonth at least

Mrs Mumpson again began the slow laborious construction of a letter
in which she dwelt upon the uncertainties of life her duty to her
offspring and the evils of vicissitude A stable home is womans
chief desire she concluded and you will surely agree to pay me the
salary you have said for a year

When Holcroft read this second epistle he so far yielded to his first
impulse that he half tore the sheet then paused irresolutely After a
few moments he went to the door and looked out upon his acres Itll
soon be plowing and planting time he thought I guess I can stand
herat least I can try it for three months Id like to turn a few
more furrows on the old place and his face softened and grew wistful
as he looked at the bare frostbound fields Suddenly it darkened and
grew stern as he muttered But Ill put my hand to no more paper with
that Weeks tribe

He strode to the stable saying to Timothy Weeks as he passed Ill
answer this letter in person

Away cantered Timothy and soon caused a flutter of expectancy in the
Weeks household by announcing that Old Holcroft looked black as a
thundercloud and was comin himself

I tell you what tis Cynthy its the turn of a hair with you now
growled Weeks Unless you agree to whatever Holcroft says you havent
the ghost of a chance

The widow felt that a crisis had indeed come Cousin Abirams was the
next place in the order of visitation but her last experience there
left her in painful doubt as to a future reception Therefore she tied
on a new cap smoothed her apron and rocked with unwonted rapidity
Itll be according to the ordering of Providence

Oh pshaw interrupted Cousin Lemuel itll be according to whether
youve got any sense or not

Mrs Weeks had been in a pitiable state of mind all day She saw that
her husband had reached the limit of his endurancethat he had
virtually already flown off the handle But to have her own kin
actually bundled out of the housewhat would people say

Acceptance of Holcrofts terms whatever they might be was the only
way out of the awkward predicament and so she began in a wheedling
tone Now Cousin Cynthy as Lemuel says youve got a firstrate
chance Holcrofts had an awful time with women and hell be glad
enough to do well by anyone who does fairly well by him Everybody
says hes well off and once youre fairly there and get things in your
own hands theres no telling what may happen Hell get a girl to help
you and Janes big enough now to do a good deal Why youll be the
same as keeping house like the rest of us

Further discussion was cut short by the arrival of the victim He
stood awkwardly in the door of the Weeks sitting room for a moment
seemingly at a loss how to state his case

Mr And Mrs Weeks now resolved to appear neutral and allow the farmer
to make his terms Then like other superior powers in the background
they proposed to exert a pressure on their relative and do a little
coercing But the widows course promised at first to relieve them of
all further effort She suddenly seemed to become aware of Holcrofts
presence sprang up and gave him her hand very cordially

Im glad to see you sir she began Its very considerate of you to
come for me I can get ready in short order and as for Jane shes
never a bit of trouble Sit down sir and make yourself to home while
I get our things together and put on my bonnet and she was about to
hasten from the room

She too had been compelled to see that Holcrofts farmhouse was the
only certain refuge left and while she had rocked and waited the
thought had come into her scheming mind Ive stipulated to stay a
year and if he says nothing against it its a bargain which I can
manage to keep him to in spite of himself even if I dont marry him

But the straightforward farmer was not to be caught in such a trap He
had come himself to say certain words and he would say them He
quietly therefore stood in the door and said Wait a moment Mrs
Mumpson Its best to have a plain understanding in all matters of
business When Ive done you may conclude not to go with me for I
want to say to you what I said this morning to your cousin Lemuel
Weeks Im glad he and his wife are now present as witnesses Im a
plain man and all I want is to make a livin off the farm Ive been
brought up on Ill get a girl to help you with the work Between
you Ill expect it to be done in a way that the dairy will yield a
fair profit Well try and see how we get on for three months and not
a year Ill not bind myself longer than three months Of course if
you manage well Ill be glad to have this plain business arrangement
go on as long as possible but its all a matter of business If I
cant make my farm pay Im going to sell or rent and leave these
parts

Oh certainly certainly Mr Holcroft You take a very senserble
view of affairs I hope you will find that I will do all that I agree
to and a great deal more Im a little afraid of the night air and the
inclement season and so will hasten to get myself and my child ready
and she passed quickly out

Weeks put his hand to his mouth to conceal a grin as he thought She
hasnt agreed to do anything that I know on Still shes right
shell do a sight more than he expects but it wont be just what he
expects

Mrs Weeks followed her relative to expedite matters and it must be
confessed that the gathering of Mrs Mumpsons belongings was no heavy
task A small hair trunk that had come down from the remote past
held her own and her childs wardrobe and represented all their worldly
possessions

Mr Weeks much pleased at the turn of affairs became very affable
but confined his remarks chiefly to the weather while Holcroft who
had an uneasy sense of being overreached in some undetected way was
abstracted and laconic He was soon on the road home however with
Mrs Mumpson and Jane Cousin Lemuels last whispered charge was
Now for mercys sake do keep your tongue still and your hands busy

Whatever possibilities there may be for the Ethiopian or the leopard
there was no hope that Mrs Mumpson would materially change any of her
characteristics The chief reason was that she had no desire to
change A more selfcomplacent person did not exist in Oakville Good
traits in other people did not interest her They were insipid they
lacked a certain pungency which a dash of evil imparts and in the
course of her minute investigations she had discerned or surmised so
much that was reprehensible that she had come to regard herself as
singularly free from sins of omission and commission What have I ever
done she would ask in her selfcommunings The question implied so
much truth of a certain kind that all her relatives were in gall and
bitterness as they remembered the weary months during which she had
rocked idly at their firesides With her talking was as much of a
necessity as breathing but during the ride to the hillside farm she
in a sense held her breath for a keen March wind was blowing

She was so quiet that Holcroft grew hopeful not realizing that the
checked flow of words must have freer course later on A cloudy
twilight was deepening fast when they reached the dwelling Holcrofts
market wagon served for the general purposes of conveyance and he
drove as near as possible to the kitchen door Descending from the
front seat which he had occupied alone he turned and offered his hand
to assist the widow to alight but she nervously poised herself on the
edge of the vehicle and seemed to be afraid to venture The wind
fluttered her scanty draperies causing her to appear like a bird of
prey about to swoop down upon the unprotected man Im afraid to jump
so far she began

Theres the step Mrs Mumpson

But I cant see it Would you mind lifting me down

He impatiently took her by the arms which seemed in his grasp like the
rounds of a chair and put her on the ground

Oh she exclaimed in gushing tones theres nothing to equal the
strong arms of a man

He hastily lifted out her daughter and said You had getter hurry in
to the fire Ill be back in a few minutes and he led his horses
down to the barn blanketed and tied them When he returned he saw
two dusky figures standing by the front door which led to the little
hall separating the kitchen from the parlor

Bless me he exclaimed You havent been standing here all this
time

Its merely due to a little oversight The door is locked you see
and

But the kitchen door is not locked

Well it didnt seem quite natural for us to enter the dwelling on
the occasion of our first arrival by the kitchen entrance and

Holcroft with a grim look strode through the kitchen and unlocked the
door

Ah exclaimed the widow I feel as if I was coming home Enter
Jane my dear Im sure the place will soon cease to be strange to
you for the home feeling is rapidly acquired when

Just wait a minute please said Holcroft and Ill light the lamp
and a candle This he did with the deftness of a man accustomed to
help himself then led the way to the upper room which was to be her
sleeping apartment Placing the candle on the bureau he forestalled
Mrs Mumpson by saying Ill freshen up the fire in the kitchen and
lay out the ham eggs coffee and other materials for supper Then I
must go out and unharness and do my night work Make yourselves to
home Youll soon be able to find everything and he hastened away

It would not be their fault if they were not soon able to find
everything Mrs Mumpsons first act was to take the candle and survey
the room in every nook and corner She sighed when she found the
closet and bureau drawers empty Then she examined the quantity and
texture of the bedding of the couch on which she was to repose as
she would express herself Jane followed her around on tiptoe doing
just what her mother did but was silent

At last they shivered in the fireless apartment threw off their scanty
wraps and went down to the kitchen Mrs Mumpson instinctively looked
around for a rocking chair and as none was visible she hastened to the
parlor and holding the candle aloft surveyed this apartment Jane
followed in her wake as before but at last ventured to suggest
Mother Mr Holcroftll be in soon and want his supper

I suppose hell want a great many things replied Mrs Mumpson with
dignity but he cant expect a lady of my connections to fly around
like a common servant It is but natural in coming to a new abode
that I should wish to know something of that abode There should have
been a hired girl here ready to receive and get supper for us Since
there is not one to receive us bring that rocking chair my dear and
I will direct you how to proceed

The child did as she was told and her mother was soon rocking on the
snuggest side of the kitchen stove interspersing her rather
bewildering orders with various reflections and surmises

Sketching the child Jane is a sad task and pity would lead us to
soften every touch if this could be done in truthfulness She was but
twelve years of age yet there was scarcely a trace of childhood left
in her colorless face Stealthy and catlike in all her movements she
gave the impression that she could not do the commonest thing except in
a sly cowering manner Her small greenishgray eyes appeared to be
growing nearer together with the lease of time and their indirect
furtive glances suggested that they had hardly if ever seen looks of
frank affection bent upon her She had early learned on the round of
visits with her mother that so far from being welcome she was scarcely
tolerated and she reminded one of a stray cat that comes to a dwelling
and seeks to maintain existence there in a lurking deprecatory manner
Her kindred recognized this feline trait for they were accustomed to
remark Shes always snoopin around

She could scarcely do otherwise poor child There had seemed no place
for her at any of the firesides She haunted halls and passageways
sat in dusky corners and kept her meager little form out of sight as
much as possible She was the last one helped at table when she was
permitted to come at all and so had early learned to watch like a
cat and when peoples backs were turned to snatch something carry it
off and devour it in secret Detected in these little pilferings to
which she was almost driven she was regarded as even a greater
nuisance than her mother

The latter was much too preoccupied to give her child attention
Ensconced in a rocking chair in the best room and always in full tide
of talk if there was anyone present she rarely seemed to think where
Jane was or what she was doing The rounds of visitation gave the
child no chance to go to school so her developing mind had little
other pabulum than what her mother supplied so freely She was
acquiring the same consuming curiosity with the redeeming feature that
she did not talk Listening in unsuspected places she heard much that
was said about her mother and herself and the pathetic part of this
experience was that she had never known enough of kindness to be
wounded She was only made to feel more fully how precarious was her
foothold in her transient abiding place and therefore was rendered
more furtive sly and distant in order to secure toleration by keeping
out of everyones way In her prowlings however she managed to learn
and understand all that was going on even better than her mother who
becoming aware of this fact was acquiring the habit of putting her
through a whispered crossquestioning when they retired for the night
It would be hard to imagine a child beginning life under more
unfavorable auspices and still harder to predict the outcome

In the course of her close watchfulness she had observed how many of
the domestic labors had been performed and she would have helped more
in the various households if she had been given a chance but the
housewives had not regarded her as sufficiently honest to be trusted in
the pantries and also found that if there was a semblance of return
for such hospitality as they extended Mrs Mumpson would remain
indefinitely Moreover the homely silent child made the women
nervous just as her mother irritated the men and they did not want
her around Thus she had come to be but the specter of a child
knowing little of the good in the world and as much of the evil as she
could understand

She now displayed however more sense than her mother The habit of
close scrutiny had made it clear that Holcroft would not long endure
genteel airs and inefficiency and that something must be done to keep
this shelter She did her best to get supper with the aid given from
the rocking chair and at last broke out sharply You must get up and
help me Hell turn us out of doors if we dont have supper ready when
he comes in

Spurred by fear of such a dire possibility Mrs Mumpson was bustling
around when Holcroft entered Well soon be ready she gushed well
soon place our evening repast upon the table

Very well was the brief reply as he passed up the stairs with the
small hair trunk on his shoulder



Chapter IV

Domestic Bliss

Holcroft had been given a foretaste of the phase of torment which he
was destined to endure in his domestic relations and was planning to
secure a refuge into which he could not be pursued He had made
himself a little more presentable for supper instinctively aware that
nothing would escape the lynxeyed widow and was taking some
measurements from the floor to a stovepipe hole leading into the
chimney flue when he became aware that someone was in the doorway
Turning he saw Jane with her small catlike eyes fixed intently upon
him Instantly he had the feeling that he was being watched and would
be watched

Suppers ready said the girl disappearing

Mrs Mumpson smiled upon himif certain contortions of her thin sharp
face could be termed a smilefrom that side of the table at which his
wife had sat so many years and he saw that the low rocking chair
which he had preserved jealously from his former help had been
brought from the parlor and established in the old familiar place
Mrs Mumpson folded her hands and assumed a look of deep solemnity
Jane as instructed also lowered her head and they waited for him to
say grace He was in far too bitter a mood for any such pious farce
and stolidly began to help them to the ham and eggs which viands had
been as nearly spoiled as was possible in their preparation The widow
raised her head with a profound sigh which set Holcrofts teeth on
edge but he proceeded silently with his supper The biscuits were
heavy enough to burden the lightest conscience and the coffee simply
grounds swimming around in lukewarm water He took a sip then put
down his cup and said quietly Guess Ill take a glass of milk
tonight Mrs Mumpson if you dont know how to make coffee I can
soon show you

Why Isnt it right How strange Perhaps it would be well for you
to show me just exactly how you like it for it will afford me much
pleasure to make it to your taste Mens tastes differ so Ive heard
that no two mens tastes were alike and after all everything is a
matter of taste Now Cousin Abiram doesnt believe in coffee at all
He thinks it is unwholesome Have YOU ever thought that it might be
unwholesome

Im used to it and would like it good when I have it at all

Why of course of course You must have it exactly to your taste
Jane my dear we must put our minds on coffee and learn precisely how
Mr Holcroft likes it and when the hired girl comes we must carefully
superintend her when she makes it By the way I suppose you will
employ my assistant tomorrow Mr Holcroft

I cant get a girl short of town was the reply and there is so
much cream in the dairy that ought to be churned at once that Ill wait
till next Monday and take down the butter

Mrs Mumpson put on a grave injured air and said Well so
disapprovingly that it was virtually saying that it was not well at
all Then suddenly remembering that this was not good policy she was
soon all smiles and chatter again How cozy this is she cried and
how soon one acquires the home feeling Why anyone looking in at the
window would think that we were an old established family and yet this
is but our first meal together But it wont be the last Mr
Holcroft I cannot make it known to you how your loneliness which
Cousin Lemuel has so feelingly described to me has affected my
feelings Cousin Nancy said but this very day that you have had
desperate times with all kinds of dreadful creatures But all thats
past Jane and me will give a look of stability and respecterbility to
every comer

Well really Mrs Mumpson I dont know whos to come

Oh youll see she replied wrinkling her thin blue lips into what
was meant for a smile and nodding her head at him encouragingly You
wont be so isolated no more Now that Im here with my offspring
your neighbors will feel that they can show you their sympathy The
most respecterble people in town will call and your life will grow
brighter and brighter clouds will roll away and

I hope the neighbors will not be so illmannered as to come without
being invited remarked Mr Holcroft grimly Its too late in the day
for them to begin now

My being here with Jane will make all the difference in the world
resumed Mrs Mumpson with as saccharine an expression as she could
assume They will come out of pure kindness and friendly interest
with the wish to encourage

Mrs Mumpson said Holcroft half desperately if anyone comes itll
be out of pure curiosity and I dont want such company Selling
enough butter eggs and produce to pay expenses will encourage me more
than all the people of Oakville if they should come in a body Whats
the use of talking in this way Ive done without the neighbors so
far and Im sure theyve been very careful to do without me I shall
have nothing to do with them except in the way of business and as I
said to you down at Lemuel Weekss business must be the first
consideration with us all and he rose from the table

Oh certainly certainly the widow hastened to say but then
business is like a cloud and the meetings and greetings of friends is
a sort of silver lining you know What would the world be without
friendsthe society of those who take an abiding interest Believe
me Mr Holcroft she continued bringing her long skinny finger
impressively down on the table you have lived alone so long that you
are unable to see the crying needs of your own constitution As a
Christian man you require human sympathy and

Poor Holcroft knew little of centrifugal force but at that moment he
was a living embodiment of it feeling that if he did not escape he
would fly into a thousand atoms Saying nervously Ive a few chores
to do he seized his hat and hastening out wandered disconsolately
around the barn Im never going to be able to stand her he groaned
I know now why my poor wife shook her head whenever this woman was
mentioned The clack of her tongue would drive any man living crazy
and the gimlet eyes of that girl Jane would bore holes through a
saints patience Well well Ill put a stove up in my room then
plowing and planting time will soon be here and I guess I can stand it
at mealtimes for three months for unless she stops her foolishness she
shant stay any longer

Jane had not spoken during the meal but kept her eyes on Holcroft
except when he looked toward her and then she instantly averted her
gaze When she was alone with her mother she said abruptly We aint
agoin to stay here long nuther

Why not was the sharp responsive query

Cause the same looks comin into his face that was in Cousin
Lemuels and Cousin Abirams and all the rest of em Fis you Id
keep still now Pears to me they all want you to keep still and you
wont

Jane said Mrs Mumpson in severe tones youre an ignorant child
Dont presume to instruct ME Besides this case is entirely
different Mr Holcroft must be made to understand from the start that
Im not a common womanthat Im his equal and in most respects his
superior If he aint made to feel this itll never enter his
headbut law Theres things which you cant and oughtnt to
understand

But I do said the girl shortly and he wont marry you nor keep
you if you talk him to death

Jane gasped Mrs Mumpson as she sank into the chair and rocked
violently

The night air was keen and soon drove Holcroft into the house As he
passed the kitchen window he saw that Mrs Mumpson was in his wifes
rocking chair and that Jane was clearing up the table

He kindled a fire on the parlor hearth hoping but scarcely expecting
that he would be left alone

Nor was he very long for the widow soon opened the door and entered
carrying the chair Oh you are here she said sweetly I heard the
fire crackling and I do so love open wood fires Theyre company in
themselves and they make those who bask in the flickering blaze
inclined to be sociable To think of how many long lonely evenings
you have sat here when you had persons in your employ with whom you
could have no affinity whatever I dont see how you stood it Under
such circumstances life must cloud up into a dreary burden It never
occurred to Mrs Mumpson that her figures of speech were often mixed
She merely felt that the sentimental phase of conversation must be very
flowery But during the first evening she had resolved on prudence
Mr Holcroft shall have time she thought for the hope to steal
into his heart that his housekeeper may become something more to him
than housekeeperthat there is a nearer and loftier relation

Meanwhile she was consumed with curiosity to know something about the
persons previously employed and his experiences with them With a
momentary and as she felt a proper pause before descending to
ordinary topics she resumed My dear Mr Holcroft no doubt it will
be a relief to your overfraught mind to pour into a symperthetic ear
the story of your troubles with thoseerthose peculiar females
thaterthat

Mrs Mumpson it would be a much greater relief to my mind to forget
all about em he replied briefly

INDEED exclaimed the widow Was they as bad as that Whod a
thought it Well well well what people there is in the world And
you couldnt abide em then

No I couldnt

Well now what hussies they must have been And to think you were
here all alone with no better company It makes my heart bleed They
DO say that Bridget Malony is equal to anything and Ive no doubt but
that she took things and did things

Well shes taken herself off and thats enough Then he groaned
inwardly Good Lord I could stand her and all her tribe betternn
this one

Yes Mr Holcroft pursued Mrs Mumpson sinking her voice to a loud
confidential whisper and I dont believe youve any idea how much she
took with her I fear youve been robbed in all these vicissitudes
Men never know whats in a house They need caretakers respecterble
women that would sooner cut out their tongues than purloin How happy
is the change which has been affected How could you abide in the
house with such a person as that Bridget Malony

Well well Mrs Mumpson She abode with herself I at least had
this room in peace and quietness

Of course of course A person so utterly unrespecterble would not
think of entering THIS apartment but then you had to meet her you
know You could not act as if she was not when she was and there
being so much of her too She was a monstrouslooking person Its
dreadful to think that such persons belong to our sex I dont wonder
you feel as you do about it all I can understand you perfectly All
your senserbleness was offended You felt that your very home had
become sacrilegious Well now I suppose she said awful things to
you

Holcroft could not endure this style of inquisition and comment another
second longer He rose and said Mrs Mumpson if you want to know
just what she said and did you must go and ask her Im very tired
Ill go out and see that the stocks all right and then go to bed

Oh certainly certainly ejaculated the widow Repose is natures
sweet rester says the poet I can see how recalling those dreadful
scenes with those peculiar females But he was gone

In passing out he caught sight of Jane whisking back into the kitchen
Shes been listening he thought Well Ill go to town tomorrow
afternoon get a stove for my room upstairs and stuff the keyhole

He went to the barn and looked with envy at the placid cows and quiet
horses At last having lingered as long as he could he returned to
the kitchen Jane had washed and put away the supper dishes after a
fashion and was now sitting on the edge of a chair in the farthest
corner of the room

Take this candle and go to your mother he said curtly Then he
fastened the doors and put out the lamp Standing for an instant at
the parlor entrance he added Please rake up the fire and put out
the light before you come up Good night

Oh certainly certainly Well look after everything just as if it
was our own The sense of strangeness will soon pass But his steps
were halfway up the stairs

Mother and daughter listened until they heard him overhead then
taking the candle they began a most minute examination of everything
in the room

Poor Holcroft listened also too worried anxious and nervous to sleep
until they came up and all sounds ceased in the adjoining apartment



Chapter V

Mrs Mumpson Takes Up Her Burdens

The next morning Holcroft awoke early The rising sun flooded his
plain little room with mellow light It was impossible to give way to
dejection in that radiance and hope he scarcely knew why sprung up
in his heart He was soon dressed and having kindled the kitchen
fire went out on the porch There had been a change in the wind during
the night and now it blew softly from the south The air was sweet
with the indefinable fragrance of spring The ethereal notes of
bluebirds were heard on every side Migratory robins were feeding in
the orchard whistling and calling their noisy congratulations on
arriving at old haunts The frost was already oozing from the ground
but the farmer welcomed the mud knowing that it indicated a long
advance toward plowing and planting time

He bared his head to the sweet warm air and took long deep breaths
If this weather holds he muttered I can soon put in some early
potatoes on that warm hillside yonder Yes I can stand even her for
the sake of being on the old place in mornings like this The
weatherll be getting better every day and I can be out of doors more
Ill have a stove in my room tonight I would last night if the old
airtight hadnt given out completely Ill take it to town this
afternoon and sell it for old iron Then Ill get a brannew one and
put it up in my room They cant follow me there and they cant follow
me outdoors and so perhaps I can live in peace and work most of the
time

Thus he was muttering to himself as lonely people so often do when he
felt that someone was near Turning suddenly he saw Jane halfhidden
by the kitchen door Finding herself observed the girl came forward
and said in her brief monotonous way

Motherll be down soon If youll show me how you want the coffee and
things I guess I can learn

I guess youll have to Jane Therell be more chance of your
teaching your mother than of her teaching you I fear But well see
well see its strange people cant see whats sensible and best for
em when they see so much

The child made no reply but watched him intently as he measured out
and then ground half a cup of coffee

The firs thing to do he began kindly is to fill the kettle with
water fresh drawn from the well Never make coffee or tea with water
thats been boiled two or three times Now Ill give the kettle a
good rinsing so as to make sure you start with it clean

Having accomplished this he filled the vessel at the well and placed
it on the fire remarking as he did so Your mother can cook a little
cant she

I spose so Jane replied When father was livin mother said she
kept a girl Since then weve visited round But shell learn and
if she cant I can

What on earthbut theres no use of talking When the water
boilsbubbles up and down you knowcall me I suppose you and your
mother can get the rest of the breakfast Oh good morning Mrs
Mumpson I was just showing Jane about the coffee You two can go on
and do all the rest but dont touch the coffee till the kettle boils
and then Ill come in and show you my way and if you please I dont
wish it any other way

Oh certainly certainly began Mrs Mumpson but Holcroft waited to
hear no more

Shes a woman he muttered and Ill say nothing rude or ugly to
her but I shant listen to her talk half a minute when I can help
myself and if she wont do any thing but talkwell well see well
see A few hours in the dairy will show whether she can use anything
besides her tongue

As soon as they were alone Jane turned sharply on her mother and said
Now youve got to do something to help At Cousin Lemuels and other
places they wouldnt let us help Anyhow they wouldnt let me He
spects us both to work and pays you for it I tell you agin he
wont let us stay here unless we do I wont go visitin round any
more feelin like a stray cat in every house I go to Youve got to
work and talk less

Why Jane How YOU talk

I talk sense Come help me get breakfast

Do you think thats a proper way for a child to address a parent

No matter what I think Come and help Youll soon know what he
thinks if we keep breakfast waitin

Well Ill do such menial work until he gets a girl and then he shall
learn that he cant expect one with such respecterble connections

Hope I may never see any of em agin interrupted Jane shortly and
then she relapsed into silence while her mother rambled on in her
characteristic way making singularly inapt efforts to assist in the
task before them

As Holcroft rose from milking a cow he found Jane beside him A ghost
could not have come more silently and again her stealthy ways gave him
an unpleasant sensation Kettle is boilin she said and was gone

He shook his head and muttered Queer tribe these Mumpsons Ive
only to get an odd fish of a girl to help and Ill have something like
a menagerie in the house He carried his pails of foaming milk to the
dairy and then entered the kitchen

Ive only a minute he began hastily seeking to forestall the widow
Yes the kettles boiling all right First scald out the
coffeepotput threequarters of a cup of ground coffee into the pot
break an egg into it so pour on the egg and coffee half a cup of cold
water and stir it all up well this way Next pour in about a pint of
boiling water from the kettle set the pot on the stove and let itthe
coffee I meancook twenty minutes remember not less than twenty
minutes Ill be back to breakfast by that time Now you know just
how I want my coffee dont you looking at Jane

Jane nodded but Mrs Mumpson began Oh certainly certainly Boil an
egg twenty minutes add half a cup of cold water and

I know interrupted Jane I can always do as you did

Holcroft again escaped to the barn and eventually returned with a deep
sigh Ill have to face a good deal of her music this morning he
thought but I shall have at least a good cup of coffee to brace me

Mrs Mumpson did not abandon the suggestion that grace should be
saidshe never abandoned anythingbut the farmer in accordance
with his purpose to be civil yet pay no attention to her obtrusive
ways gave no heed to her hint He thought Jane looked apprehensive
and soon learned the reason His coffee was at least hot but seemed
exceedingly weak

I hope now that its just right said Mrs Mumpson complacently and
feeling sure that it was made just to suit you I filled the coffeepot
full from the kettle We can drink what we desire for breakfast and
then the rest can be set aside until dinner time and warmed over Then
youll have it just to suit you for the next meal and we at the same
time will be practicing econermy It shall now be my great aim to
help you econermize Any coarse menial hands can work but the great
thing to be considered is a caretaker one who by thoughtfulness and
the employment of her mind will make the labor of others affective

During this speech Holcroft could only stare at the woman The rapid
motion of her thin jaw seemed to fascinate him and he was in
perplexity over not merely her rapid utterance but also the queries
Had she maliciously spoiled the coffee Or didnt she know any better
I cant make her out he thought but she shall learn that I have a
will of my own and he quietly rose took the coffeepot and poured
its contents out of doors then went through the whole process of
making his favorite beverage again saying coldly Jane you had
better watch close this time I dont wish anyone to touch the
coffeepot but you

Even Mrs Mumpson was a little abashed by his manner but when he
resumed his breakfast she speedily recovered her complacency and
volubility Ive always heard she said with her little cackling
laugh that men would be extravergant especially in some things
There are some things theyre fidgety about and will have just so
Well well who has a better right than a welltodo forehanded man
Woman is to complement the man and it should be her aim to study the
greatthe greatshall we say reason for her being Which is
adaptation and she uttered the word with feeling assured that
Holcroft could not fail of being impressed by it The poor man was
bolting such food as had been prepared in his haste to get away

Yes continued the widow adaptation is womans mission and

Really Mrs Mumpson your and Janes mission this morning will be to
get as much butter as possible out of the cream and milk on hand Ill
set the old dog on the wheel and start the churn within half an hour
and he rose with the thought Id rather finish my breakfast on milk
and coffee by and by than stand this And he said Please let the
coffee be until I come in to show you about taking out and working the
butter

The scenes in the dairy need not be dwelt upon He saw that Jane might
be taught and that she would probably try to do all that her strength
permitted It was perfectly clear that Mrs Mumpson was not only
ignorant of the duties which he had employed her to perform but that
she was also too preoccupied with her talk and notions of gentility
ever to learn He was already satisfied that in inducing him to engage
her Lemuel Weeks had played him a trick but there seemed no other
resource than to fulfill his agreement With Mrs Mumpson in the
house there might be less difficulty in securing and keeping a hired
girl who with Jane might do the essential work But the future
looked so unpromising that even the strong coffee could not sustain his
spirits The hopefulness of the early morning departed leaving
nothing but dreary uncertainty

Mrs Mumpson was bent upon accompanying him to town and engaging the
girl herself There would be great propriety in my doing so she
argued at dinner and propriety is something that adorns all the human
race There would be no danger of my getting any of the peculiar
females such as you have been afflicted with As I am to superintend
her labors she will look up to me with respect and humility if she
learns from the first to recognize in me a superior on whom she will be
dependent for her daily bread No shiftless hussy would impose upon
ME I would bring homehow sweet the word soundsa model of
industry and patient endurance She would be deferential she would
know her place too Everything would go like clockwork in our home
Ill put on my things at once and

Excuse me Mrs Mumpson It would not be right to leave Jane here
alone Moreover Id rather engage my own help

But my dear Mr Holcroft you dont realizemen never do
realizethat you will have a long lonely ride with a female of
unknownunknown antercedents It will be scarcely respecterble and
respecterbility should be man and womans chief aim Jane is not a
timid child and in an emergency like this even if she was she would
gladly sacrifice herself to sustain the proprieties of life Now that
your life has begun under new and better auspices I feel that I ought
to plead with you not to cloud your brightening prospects by a
thoughtless unregard of what society looks upon as proper The eyes of
the community will now be upon us

You must excuse me Mrs Mumpson All I ask of the community is to
keep their eyes on their own business while I attend to mine in my own
way The probabilities are that the girl will come out on the stage
Monday and he rose from the dinner table and hastily made his
preparations for departure He was soon driving rapidly away having a
sort of nervous apprehension lest Jane or the widow should suddenly
appear on the seat beside him A basket of eggs and some inferior
butter with the burntout stove were in his wagon and his bank book
was in his pocket It was with sinking heart that he thought of making
further inroads on his small accumulations

Before he was out of sight Mrs Mumpson betook herself to the rocking
chair and began to expatiate on the blindness and obduracy of men in
general and of Mr Holcroft in particular They are all much alike
she complained and are strangely neglectful of the proprieties of
life My dear deceased husband your father was becoming gradually
senserble of my value in guiding him in this respect and indeed I may
add in all respects when in the very prime of his expanding manhood
he was laid low Of course my happiness was buried then and my heart
can never throb again but I have a mission in the worldI feel
itand here is a desolate home bereft of female influence and
consolation and hitherto painfully devoid of respecterbility

I once called on the late Mrs Holcroft andI must say itI went
away depressed by a sense of her lack of ability to develop in her
husband those qualities which would make him an ornament to society
She was a silent woman she lacked mind and ideas She had seen little
of the world and knew not what was swaying people Therefore her
husband having nothing else to think of became absorbed in the
accumulation of dollars Not that I object to dollarsthey have their
proper placebut minds should be fixed on all things We should take
a deep personal interest in our fellow beings and thus we grow broad
As I was saying Mr Holcroft was not developed by his late spouse He
needs awakening arousing stimulating drawing out and such I feel to
be my mission I must be patient I cannot expect the habits of years
to pass away under a different kind of female influence at once

Jane had been stolidly washing and putting away dishes during this
partial address to herself and partial soliloquy but now remarked
You and me will pass away in a week if you go on as youve begun I
can see it comin Then wherell we go to

Your words Jane only show that you are an ignorant shortsighted
child Do you suppose that a woman of my years and experience would
make no better provision for the future than a mans changeful minda
warped and undeveloped mind at that No I have an agreement with Mr
Holcroft I shall be a member of his household for three months at
least and long before that he will begin to see everything in a new
light It will gradually dawn upon him that he has been defrauded of
proper female influence and society Now he is crude he thinks only
of work and accumulating but when the work is done by a menial
females hands and his mind is more at rest there will begin to steal
in upon him the cravings of his mind He will see that material things
are not all in all

Praps he will I dont half know that youre talkin about Fis
you Id learn to work and do things as he wants em Thats what Im
going to do Shall I go now and make up his bed and tidy his room

I think I will accompany you Jane and see that your task is properly
performed

Of course you want to see everythin in the room just as I do

As housekeeper I should see everything that is under my care That
is the right way to look at the matter

Well come and look then

You are becoming strangely disrespectful Jane

Cant help it replied the girl Im gettin mad Weve been
elbowed around longs I can remember at least Ive been and now were
in a place where weve a right to be and you do nothin but talk
talk talk when he hates talk Now youll go up in his room and
youll see everythin in it so you could tell it all off tomorrow
Why cant you see he hates talk and wants somethin done

Jane said Mrs Mumpson in her most severe and dignified manner
you are not only disrespectful to your parent but youre a time
server What Mr Holcroft wants is a very secondary matter what is
BEST for him is the chief consideration But I have touched on things
far above your comprehension Come you can make up the bed and I
shall inspect as becomes my station



Chapter VI

A Marriage

In a quiet side street of the market town in which Mr Holcroft was
accustomed to dispose of his farm produce was a threestory tenement
house A family occupied each floor those dwelling in the first two
stories being plain respectable people of the mechanic class The
rooms in the third story were of course the cheapest but even from
the street might be seen evidences that more money had been spent upon
them than could have been saved in rent Lace curtains were looped
aside from the windows through which were caught glimpses of flowers
that must have come from a greenhouse We have only to enter these
apartments to find that the suggestion of refined taste is amply
fulfilled While nothing is costly there is a touch of grace a hint
of beauty in everything permitting simple adornment The mistress of
these rooms is not satisfied with neatness and order merely it is her
instinct to add something to please the eyea need essential to her
yet too often conspicuously absent in rented quarters of a similar
character

It is remarkable to what a degree peoples abodes are a reflex of
themselves Mrs Alida Ostrom had been brought to these rooms a happy
bride but a few months since They were then bare and not very clean
Her husband had seemed bent on indulging her so far as his limited
means permitted He had declared that his income was so modest that he
could afford nothing better than these cheap rooms in an obscure
street but she had been abundantly content for she had known even the
extremity of poverty

Alida Ostrom had passed beyond the period of girlhood with its
superficial desires and ambitions When her husband first met her she
was a woman of thirty and had been chastened by deep sorrows and some
bitter experiences Years before she and her mother had come to this
town from a New England city in the hope of bettering their
circumstances They had no weapons other than their needles with which
to fight lifes battle but they were industrious and
frugalcharacteristic traits which won the confidence of the
shopkeepers for whom they worked All went as well perhaps as they
could expect for two or three years their secluded lives passing
uneventfully and to a certain extent happily They had time to read
some good books obtained at a public library they enjoyed an
occasional holiday in the country and they went to church twice every
Sunday when it was not stormy The mother usually dozed in the obscure
seat near the door which they occupied for she was getting old and
the toil of the long week wearied herAlida on the contrary was
closely attentive Her mind seemed to crave all the sustenance it
could get from every source and her reverential manner indicated that
the hopes inspired by her faith were dear and cherished Although they
lived such quiet lives and kept themselves apart from their neighbors
there was no mystery about them which awakened surmises Theyve seen
better days was the common remark when they were spoken of and this
was true While they had no desire to be social with the people among
whom they lived they did not awaken prejudices by the assertion of
superiority Indeed it was seen that the two women had all they could
do to earn their livelihood and they were left to do this in peace

When Alida Armstrongfor that was her maiden namecarried her own and
her mothers work to and from the shops she often encountered admiring
glances She was not exactly pretty but she had the good refined face
which is often more attractive than the merely pretty one and she
possessed a trim rounded figure which she knew how to clothe with
taste from the simplest and most inexpensive materials Nor did she
seek to dress above her station When passing along the street any
discerning person would recognize that she was a working girl only the
superficial would look upon her as a commonplace girl There was
something in her modest air and graceful elastic carriage which
suggested the thought to many observers She has seen better days

The memory of these days which had promised immunity from wearing
toil anxiety and poverty was a barrier between the two women and
their present world Death had bereft them of husband father and
such property as he had left had been lost in a bad investment
Learning that they were almost penniless they had patiently set about
earning honest bread This they had succeeded in doing as long as the
mother kept her usual health But the infirmities of age were creeping
upon her One winter she took a heavy cold and was very ill She
rallied only temporarily in the milder days of spring In the summers
heat her strength failed and she died

During her mothers long illness Alida was devotion itself The strain
upon her was severe indeed for she not only had to earn food for both
but there were also doctors bills medicines and delicacies to pay
for The poor girl grew thin from work by day watching by night and
from fear and anxiety at all times Their scanty savings were
exhausted articles were sold from their rooms the few precious
heirlooms of silver and china were disposed of Alida even denied
herself the food she needed rather than ask for help or permit her
mother to want for anything which ministered to their vain hopes of
renewed health

What she should have done she scarcely knew had not an unexpected
friend interested himself in her behalf In one of the mens clothing
stores was a cutter from whom she obtained work Soon after he
appeared in this shop he began to manifest signs of interest in her He
was about her own age he had a good trade and she often wondered why
he appeared so reticent and moody as compared with others in similar
positions But he always spoke kindly to her and when her mothers
illness first developed he showed all the leniency permitted to him in
regard to her work His apparent sympathy and the need of explaining
why she was not able to finish her tasks as promptly as usual led her
gradually to reveal to him the sad struggle in which she was engaged
He promised to intercede in her behalf with their mutual employers and
asked if he might come to see her mother

Recognizing how dependent she was upon this mans good will and seeing
nothing in his conduct but kindness and sympathy she consented His
course and his words confirmed all her good impressions and awakened on
her side corresponding sympathy united with a lively gratitude He
told her that he also was a stranger in the town that he had but few
acquaintances and no friends that he had lost relatives and was in no
need to go about like other young men His manner was marked
apparently by nothing more than interest and a wish to help her and
was untinged by gallantry so they gradually became good friends When
he called Sunday afternoons the mother looked at him wistfully in the
hope that her daughter would not be left without a protector At last
the poor woman died and Alida was in sore distress for she had no
means with which to bury her Ostrom came and said in the kindest
tones

You must let me lend you what you need and you can pay me back with
interest if you wish You wont be under any obligation for I have
money lying idle in the bank When you have only yourself to support
it will not take you long to earn the sum

There seemed nothing else for her to do and so it was arranged With
tearblinded eyes she made her simple mourning and within a week after
her mothers death was at work again eager to repay her debt He
urged her not to hastento take all the rest she could while the hot
weather lasted and few evenings passed that he did not come to take
her out for a walk through the quieter streets

By this time he had won her confidence completely and her heart
overflowed with gratitude Of course she was not so unsophisticated as
not to know whither all this attention was tending but it was a great
relief to her mind that his courtship was so quiet and undemonstrative
Her heart was sore and griefstricken and she was not conscious of any
other feeling toward him than the deepest gratitude and wish to make
such return as was within her power He was apparently very frank in
regard to his past life and nothing was said which excited her
suspicions Indeed she felt that it would be disloyalty to think of
questioning or surmising evil of one who had proved himself so true a
friend in her sore need She was therefore somewhat prepared for the
words he spoke one warm September day as they sat together in a little
shaded park

Alida he said a little nervously we are both strangers and alone
in this world but surely we are no longer strangers to each other
Let us go quietly to some minister and be married That is the best
way for you to pay your debt and keep me always in debt to you

She was silent a moment then faltered Id rather pay all my debt
first

What debts can there be between husband and wife Come now let us
look at the matter sensibly I dont want to frighten you Things
will go on much the same We can take quiet rooms I will bring work
to you instead of your having to go after it Its nobodys business
but our own Weve not a circle of relations to consult or invite We
can go to some parsonage the ministers family will be the witnesses
then Ill leave you at your room as usual and no one will be any the
wiser till Ive found a place where we can go to housekeeping That
wont be long I can tell you

He placed the matter in such a simple natural light that she did not
know how to refuse

Perhaps I do not love you as much as you ought to be loved and
deserve to be in view of all your kindness she tried to explain I
feel I ought to be very truthful and not deceive you in the least as I
know you would not deceive me So strong a shiver passed through his
frame that she exclaimed You are taking cold or you dont feel well

Oh its nothing he said hastily only the night air and then a
fellow always feels a little nervous I suppose when hes asking for
something on which his happiness depends Im satisfied with such
feeling and good will as you have for me and will be only too glad to
get you just as you are Come before it is too late in the evening

Is your heart bent on this after what I have said Wilson

Yes yes indeed clasping her hand and drawing her to her feet

It would seem very ungrateful in me to refuse after all you have done
for me and mother if you think its right and best Will you go to
the minister whose church I attended and who came to see mother

Certainly anyone you like and he put her hand on his arm and led
her away

The clergyman listened sympathetically to her brief history of Ostroms
kindness then performed a simple ceremony which his wife and daughters
witnessed As they were about to depart he said I will send you a
certificate

Dont trouble yourself to do that said the groom Ill call for it
some evening soon

Never had she seen Ostrom in such gay spirits as on their return and
womanlike she was happy chiefly because she had made him happy She
also felt a glad sense of security Her mothers dying wish had been
fulfilled she had now a protector and would soon have a home instead
of a boarding place among strangers

Her husband speedily found the rooms to which the reader has been
introduced The street on which they were located was no thoroughfare
Its farther end was closed by a fence and beyond were fields With the
exception of those who dwelt upon it or had business with the
residents few people came thither To this locality Ostrom brought
his bride and selected rooms whose windows were above those of the
surrounding houses So far from regretting this isolation and
remoteness from the central life of the town Alidas feelings
sanctioned his choice The sense of possessing security and a refuge
was increased and it was as natural for her to set about making the
rooms homelike as it was to breathe Her husband appeared to have
exhausted his tendencies toward close economy in the choice of
apartments and she was given more money than she desired with which to
furnish and decorate He said fix everything up to suit your mind
and Ill be satisfied

This she did with such skill taste and good management that she
returned a large portion of the sum he had given her whereupon he
laughingly remarked that she had already saved more than she owed him
He seemed disinclined to accompany her in the selection of their simple
outfit but professed himself so pleased with her choice of everything
that she was gratified and happy in the thought of relieving him from
trouble

Thus their married life began under what appeared to her the most
promising and congenial circumstances She soon insisted on having
work again and her busy fingers did much to increase his income

Alida was not an exacting woman and recognized from the beginning that
her husband would naturally have peculiar ways of his own Unlike Mrs
Mumpson she never expatiated on adaptation but Ostrom soon learned
with much inward relief that his wife would accept unquestioningly
what appeared to be his habits and preferences He went early to his
place of work taking the nice little lunch which she prepared and
returned in the dusk of the evening when he always found a warm dinner
in readiness After this he was ready enough to walk with her but
as before chose the least frequented streets Places of amusement and
resort seemed distasteful On Sundays he enjoyed a ramble in the
country as long as the season permitted and then showed a great
disinclination to leave the fireside For a time he went with her in
the evening to church but gradually persuaded her to remain at home
and read or talk to him

His wife felt that she had little cause to complain of his quiet ways
and methodical habits He had exhibited them before marriage and they
were conducive to her absolute sense of proprietorship in himan
assurance so dear to a womans heart The pleasures of his home and
her society appeared to be all that he craved At times she had
wondered a little at a certain air of apprehensiveness in his manner
when steps were heard upon the stairs but as the quiet days and weeks
passed such manifestations of nervousness ceased Occasionally he
would start violently and mutter strange words in his sleep but noting
disturbed the growing sense of security and satisfaction in Alidas
heart The charm of a regular quiet life grows upon one who has a
nature fitted for it and this was true to an unusual degree of Alida
Ostrom Her content was also increased by the fact that her husband
was able each month to deposit a goodly portion of their united
earnings in a savings bank

Every day every week was so like the preceding ones that it seemed as
if their happy life might go on forever She was gladly conscious that
there was more than gratitude and good will in her heart She now
cherished a deep affection for her husband and felt that he had become
essential to her life

Oh how happy mother would be if she knew how safe and protected I
am she murmured one March evening as she was preparing her husbands
dinner Leaving me alone in the world was far worse to her than dying

At that very moment a gauntlooking woman with a child in her arms
stood in the twilight on the opposite side of the street looking up at
the windows



Chapter VII

From Home to the Street

As the shadows of the gloomy March evening deepened Alida lighted the
lamp and was then a little surprised to hear a knock at the door No
presentiment of trouble crossed her mind she merely thought that one
of her neighbors on the lower floors had stepped up to borrow something

Come in she cried as she adjusted the shade of the lamp

A tall thin pale woman entered carrying a child that was partly
hidden by a thin shawl their only outer protection against the chill
winds which had been blustering all day Alida looked at the stranger
inquiringly and kindly expecting an appeal for charity The woman
sank into a chair as if exhausted and fixed her dark hollow eyes on
Mrs Ostrom She appeared consumed by a terrible curiosity

Alida wondered at the strange chill of apprehension with which she
encountered this gaze It was so intent so searching yet so utterly
devoid of a trace of good will She began gently Can I do anything
for you

For a moment or two longer there was no response other than the same
cold questioning scrutiny as if instead of a sweetfaced woman
something monstrously unnatural was present At last in slow icy
utterance came the words So you areHER

Is this woman insane thought Alida Why else does she look at me
so Oh that Wilson would come Im sorry for you my good woman
she began kindly You are laboring under some mistake My husband

YOUR husband exclaimed the stranger with an indescribable accent of
scorn and reproach

Yes replied Alida with quiet dignity MY husband will be home soon
and he will protect me You have no right to enter my rooms and act as
you do If you are sick and in trouble I and my husband

Please tell me miss how he became YOUR husband

By lawful marriage by my pastor

Well soon see how LAWFUL it was replied the woman with a bitter
laugh Id like you to tell me how often a man can be married
lawfully

What do you mean cried Alida with a sudden flash in her blue eyes
Then as if reproaching herself she added kindly Pardon me I see
you are not well You do not realize what you are saying or where you
are Take a seat nearer the fire and when Mr Ostrom comes from his
work hell take you to your friends

All the while she was speaking the woman regarded her with a hard
stony gaze then replied coldly and decisively You are wrong
misshow that title grated on Alidas earsI am neither insane nor
drunk I do know what I am saying and where I am You are playing a
bold game or else you have been deceived and very easily deceived
too They say some women are so eager to be married that they ask no
questions but jump at the first chance Whether deceived or
deceiving it doesnt matter now But you and he shall learn that
there is a law in the land which will protect an honest woman in her
sacred rights You neednt look so shocked and bewildered You are
not a young giddy girl if I may judge from your face What else could
you expect when you took up with a stranger you knew nothing about Do
you know that likeness and she drew from her bosom a daguerreotype

Alida waved it away as she said indignantly I wont believe ill of my
husband I

No miss interrupted the woman sternly you are right for once
You wont indeed believe ill of YOUR husband but youll have to
believe ill of MINE Theres no use of your putting on such airs any
longer No matter how rash and silly you may have been if you have a
spark of honesty youll be open to proof If you and he try to brazen
it out the law will open both your eyes Look at that likeness look
at these letters and I have other proof and witnesses which cant be
disputed The name of the man you are living with is not Wilson
Ostrom His name is Henry Ferguson I am Mrs Ferguson and I have my
marriage certificate andWhat Are you going to faint Well I can
wait till you recover and till HE comes and she coolly sat down again

Alida had glanced at the proofs which the woman had thrust into her
hands then staggered back to a lounge that stood near She might have
fainted but at that awful moment she heard a familiar step on the
stairs She was facing the door the terrible stranger sat at one
side with her back toward it

When Ostrom entered he first saw Alida looking pale and ill He
hastened toward her exclaiming Why Lida dear what is the matter
You are sick

Instinctively she sprang to his arms crying Oh thank God Youve
come Take away this awful woman

Yes Henry Ferguson its very proper you should take me away from a
place like this

As the man who had called himself Wilson Ostrom heard that voice he
trembled like an aspen his clasp of Alida relaxed his arms dropped to
his side and as he sank into a chair and covered his face with his
hands he groaned Lost

Found out you mean was the womans reply

Step by step with horrorstricken eyes Alida retreated from the man
to whose protection and embrace she had flown Then its true she
said in a hoarse whisper

He was speechless

You are willfully blind now miss if you dont see its true was
the strangers biting comment

Paying no heed to her Alidas eyes rested on the man whom she had
believed to be her husband She took an irresolute step toward him
Speak Wilson she cried I gave you my whole faith and no one shall
destroy it but yourself Speak explain Show me that theres some
horrible mistake

Lida said the man lifting his bloodless face if you knew all the
circumstances

She shall know them half shrieked the woman as if at last stung to
fury I see that you both hope to get through this affair with a
little high tragedy then escape and come together again in some other
hiding place As for this creature she can go where she pleases
after hearing the truth but you Henry Ferguson have got to do your
duty by me and your child or go to prison Let me tell you miss that
this man was also married to me by a minister I have my certificate
and can produce witnesses Theres one little point youll do well to
consider she continued in bitter sarcasm he married me first I
suppose you are not so young and innocent as not to know where this
fact places YOU He courted and won me as other girls are courted and
married He promised me all that he ever promised you Then when I
lost my rosy cheekswhen I became sick and feeble from
childbearinghe deserted and left me almost penniless You neednt
think you will have to take my word for this I have proof enough
And now Henry Ferguson Ive a few words for you and then you must
take your choice You cant escape I and my brother have tracked you
here You cant leave these rooms without going to prison Youd be
taken at the very door But I give you one more chance If you will
promise before God to do your duty by me and your child Ill forgive
as far as a wronged woman can forgive Neither I nor my brother will
take proceedings against you What this woman will do I dont know
If she prosecutes you and you are true to me Ill stand by you but I
wont stand another false step or a false word from you

Ferguson had again sunk into his chair buried his face in his hands
and sat trembling and speechless Never for an instant had Alida taken
her eyes from him and now with a long wailing cry she exclaimed
Thank God thank God Mothers dead

This was now her best consolation She rushed into her bedchamber and
a moment later came out wearing her hat and cloak Ferguson started
up and was about to speak but she silenced him by a gesture and her
tones were sad and stern as she said Mr Ferguson from your manner
more truly than from this woman I learn the truth You took advantage
of my misfortunes my sorrow and friendlessness to deceive me You
know how false are your wifes words about my eagerness to be deceived
and married But you have nothing to fear from me I shall not
prosecute you as she suggests and I charge you before God to do your
duty by your wife and child and never to speak to me again Turning
she hastened toward the door

Where are you going Ferguson exclaimed seeking to intercept her

She waved him off I dont know she replied Ive no right to be
here and she fled down the stairway and out into the darkness

The child had not wakened It was well that it had not looked upon
such a scene even in utter ignorance of its meaning



Chapter VIII

Holcrofts View of Matrimony

Holcroft was indeed very lonely as he drove through the bare March
fields and leafless woods on his way to town The sky had clouded
again like his prospects and he had the dreary sense of desolation
which overwhelms a quiet domestic man who feels that his home and all
to which he clings are slipping from him His lot was hard enough at
best and he had a bitter sense of being imposed upon and wronged by
Lemuel Weeks It was now evident enough that the widow and her
daughter had been an intolerable burden to his neighbor who had taken
advantage of his need and induced him to assume the burden through
false representation To a man of Holcrofts simple straightforward
nature any phase of trickery was intensely repugnant and the fact
that he had been overreached in a matter relating to his dearest hopes
galled him to the quick He possessed the strong common sense of his
class his wife had been like him in this respect and her influence
had intensified the trait Queer people with abnormal manners excited
his intense aversion The most charitable view that he could take of
Mrs Mumpson was that her mindsuch as she hadwas unbalanced that
it was an impossibility for her to see any subject or duty in a
sensible light or its right proportions

Her course so prejudicial to her own interests and her incessant and
stilted talk were proof to his mind of a certain degree of insanity
and he had heard that people in this condition often united to their
unnatural ways a wonderful degree of cunning Her child was almost as
uncanny as herself and gave him a shivering sense of discomfort
whenever he caught her small greenish eyes fixed upon him

Yet shell be the only one wholl earn her salt I dont see how Im
going to stand emI dont indeed but suppose Ill have to for three
months or else sell out and clear out

By the time he reached town a cold rain had set in He went at once to
the intelligence office but could obtain no girl for Mrs Mumpson to
superintend nor any certain promise of one He did not much care
for he felt that the new plan was not going to work Having bartered
all his eggs for groceries he sold the old stove and bought a new one
then drew from the bank a little ready money Since his butter was so
inferior he took it to his friend Tom Watterly the keeper of the
poorhouse

Prosperous Tom slapped his old friend on the back and said You look
awfully glum and chopfallen Jim Come now dont look at the world as
if it was made of tar pitch and turpentine I know your lucks been
hard but you make it a sight harder by being so set in all your ways
You think theres no place to live on Gods earth but that old
upanddownhill farm of yours that I wouldnt take as a gift Why
man alive theres a dozen things you can turn your hand to but if you
will stay there do as other men do Pick out a smart handy woman
that can make butter yaller as gold thatll bring gold and not such
limpsyslimsy ghostlylooking stuff as youve brought me Bein its
you Ill take it and give as much for it as Id pay for better but
you cant run your old ranch in this fashion

I know it Tom replied Holcroft ruefully Im all at sea but as
you say Im set in my ways and Id rather live on bread and milk and
keep my farm than make money anywhere else I guess Ill have to give
it all up though and pull out but its like rooting up one of the
old oaks in the meadow lot The fact is Tom Ive been fooled into one
of the worst scrapes Ive got into yet

I see how it is said Tom heartily and complacently you want a
practical foresighted man to talk straight at you for an hour or two
and clear up the fog youre in You study and brood over little things
out there alone until they seem mountains which you cant get over
nohow when if youd take one good jump out theyd be behind you
Now youve got to stay and take a bite with me and then well light
our pipes and untangle this snarl No backing out I can do you more
good than all the preachin you ever heard Hey there Bill
shouting to one of the paupers who was detailed for such work take
this team to the barn and feed em Come in come in old feller
Youll find that Tom Watterly allus has a snack and a good word for an
old crony

Holcroft was easily persuaded for he felt the need of cheer and he
looked up to Tom as a very sagacious practical man So he said
Perhaps you can see farther into a millstone than I can and if you
can show me a way out of my difficulties youll be a friend sure
enough

Why of course I can Your difficulties are all here and here
touching his bullet head and the region of his heart There aint no
great difficulties in fact but after youve brooded out there a week
or two alone you think youre caught as fast as if you were in a bear
trap Here Angy addressing his wife Ive coaxed Holcroft to take
supper with us You can hurry it up a little cant you

Mrs Watterly gave their guest a cold limp hand and a rather frigid
welcome But this did not disconcert him Its only her way he had
always thought She looks after her husbands interests as mine did
for me and she dont talk him to death

This thought in the main summed up Mrs Watterlys best traits

She was a commonplace narrow selfish woman whose character is not
worth sketching Tom stood a little in fear of her and was usually
careful not to impose extra tasks but since she helped him to save and
get ahead he regarded her as a model wife

Holcroft shared in his opinion and sighed deeply as he sat down to
supper Ah Tom he said youre a lucky man Youve got a wife
that keeps everything indoors up to the mark and gives you a chance to
attend to your own proper business Thats the way it was with mine
I never knew what a lopsided helpless creature a man was until I was
left alone You and I were lucky in getting the women we did but when
my partner left me she took all the luck with her That aint the
worst She took whats more than luck and money and everything I
seemed to lose with her my grit and interest in most things Itll
seem foolishness to you but I cant take comfort in anything much
except working that old farm that Ive worked and played on ever since
I can remember anything Youre not one of those fools Tom that have
to learn from their own experience Take a bit from mine and be good
to your wife while you can Id give all Im worthI know that aint
muchif I could say some things to my wife and do some things for her
that I didnt do

Holcroft spoke in the simplicity of a full and remorseful heart but he
unconsciously propitiated Mrs Watterly in no small degree Indeed
she felt that he had quite repaid her for his entertainment and the
usually taciturn woman seconded his remarks with much emphasis

Well now Angy said Tom if you averaged up husbands in these parts
I guess youd find you were faring rather better than most women folks
I let you take the bit in your teeth and go your own jog mostly Now
own up dont I

That wasnt my meaning exactly Tom resumed Holcroft You and I
could well afford to let our wives take their own jog for they always
jogged steady and faithful and didnt need any urging and guiding But
even a dumb critter likes a good word now and then and a little patting
on the back It doesnt cost us anything and does them a sight of
good But we kind of let the chances slip by and forget about it until
like enough its too late

Well replied Tom with a deprecatory look at his wife Angy dont
take to pettin very much She thinks its a kind of foolishness for
such middleaged people as were getting to be

A husband can show his consideration without blarneying remarked
Mrs Watterly coldly When a man takes on in that way you may be sure
he wants something extra to pay for it

After a little thought Holcroft said I guess its a good way to pay
for it between husband and wife

Look here Jim since youre so well up on the matrimonial question
why in thunder dont you marry again That would settle all your
difficulties and Tom looked at his friend with a sort of wonder that
he should hesitate to take this practical sensible course

Its very easy for you to say Why dont you marry again If you
were in my place youd see that there are things in the way of marrying
for the sake of having a good butter maker and all that kind of thing

Mr Watterly wouldnt be long in comforting himself remarked his
wifeHis advice to you makes the course hed take mighty clear

Now Angy said Tom reproachfully Well he added with a grin
youre forewarned So youve only to take care of yourself and not
give me a chance

The trouble is Holcroft resumed I dont see how an honest man is
going to comfort himself unless it all comes about in some natural sort
of way I suppose there are people who can marry over and over again
just as easy as theyd roll off a log It aint for me to judge em
and I dont understand how they do it You are a very practical man
Tom but just you put yourself in my shoes and see what youd do In
the first place I dont know of a woman in the world that Id think of
marrying Thats saying nothing against the womentheres lots too
good for mebut I dont know em and I cant go around and hunt em
up Even if I could with my shy awkward ways I wouldnt feel half
so nervous starting out on a bear hunt Heres difficulty right at the
beginning Supposing I found a nice sensible woman such as Id be
willing to marry there isnt one chance in a hundred shed look at an
old fellow like me Another difficulty Supposing she would suppose
she looked me square in the eyes and said So you truly want a wife
what in thunder would I say thenI dont want a wife I want a
housekeeper a butter maker one that would look after my interests as
if they were her own and if I could hire a woman that would do what I
wish Id never think of marrying I cant tell a woman that I love
her when I dont If I went to a minister with a woman Id be
deceiving him and deceiving her and perjuring myself promiscuously
I married once according to law and gospel and I was married through
and through and I cant do the thing over again in any way that would
seem to me like marrying at all The idea of me sitting by the fire
and wishing that the woman who sat on the tother side of the stove was
my first wife Yet I couldnt help doing this any more than breathing
Even if there was any chance of my succeeding I cant see anything
square or honest in my going out and hunting up a wife as a mere matter
of business I know other people do it and Ive thought a good deal
about it myself but when it comes to the point of acting I find I
cant do it

The two men now withdrew from the table to the fireside and lighted
their pipes Mrs Watterly stepped out for a moment and Tom looking
over his shoulder to make sure she was out of ear shot said under his
breath But suppose you found a woman that you could love and obey
and all that

Oh of course that would make everything different I wouldnt begin
with a lie then and I know enough of my wife to feel sure that she
wouldnt be a sort of dog in the manger after she was dead She was
one of those good souls that if she could speak her mind this minute
she would say James whats best and right for you is best and
right But its just because she was such a good wife that I know
theres no use of trying to put anyone in her place Where on earth
could I find anybody and how could we get acquainted so that wed know
anything about each other No I must just scratch along for a short
time as things are and be on the lookout to sell or rent

Tom smoked meditatively for a few moments and then remarked I guess
thats your best way out

It aint an easy way either said Holcroft Finding a purchaser or
tenant for a farm like mine is almost as hard as finding a wife Then
as I feel leaving my place is next to leaving the world

Tom shook his head ruefully and admitted I declare Jim when a
feller comes to think it all over you ARE in a bad fix especially as
you feel I thought I could talk you over into practical common sense
in no time Its easy enough when one dont know all the bearins of a
case to think carelessly Oh he aint as bad off as he thinks he is
He can do this and that and the tother thing But when you come to
look it all over you find he cant except at a big loss Of course
you can give away your farm on which you were doing well and getting
ahead though how you did it I cant see Youd have to about give it
away if you forced a sale and where on earth youll find a tenant
wholl pay anything worth consideringBut theres no use of croaking
I wish I could help you old feller By jocks I believe I can
Theres an old woman here whos right smart and handy when she cant
get her bottle filled I believe shed be glad to go with you for she
dont like our board and lodging over much

Do you think shed go tonight

Oh yes Guess so A little cold waterll be a good change for her

Mrs Wiggins was seen and feeling that any change would be for the
better readily agreed to go for very moderate wages Holcroft looked
dubiously at the womans heavy form and heavier face but felt that it
was the best he could do Squeezing Mrs Watterlys cold limp hand in
a way that would have thawed a lump of ice he said goodby and then
declaring that he would rather do his own harnessing for a night ride
he went out into the storm Tom put on his rubber coat and went to the
barn with his friend toward whom he cherished honest good will

By jocks he ejaculated sympathetically but you have hard lines
Jim What in thunder would I do with two such widdy women to look after
my house



Chapter IX

Mrs Mumpson Accepts Her Mission

As Holcroft drove through the town Mrs Wiggins who as matters were
explained to her had expressed her views chiefly by affirmative nods
now began to use her tongue with much fluency

Hi ave a friend herhabouts she said an shes been akeepin
some of my things Hill be olden to ye master hif yell jes stop a
bit hat the door whiles hi gets em Hif yell hadvance me a dollar or
so on me wages hitll be a long time hafore I trouble ye hagain

The farmer had received too broad a hint not to know that Mrs Wiggins
was intent on renewing her acquaintance with her worst enemy He
briefly replied therefore Its too late to stop now Ill be coming
down soon again and will get your things

In vain Mrs Wiggins expostulated for he drove steadily on With a
sort of grim humor he thought of the meeting of the two widdy women
as Tom had characterized them and of Mrs Mumpsons dismay at finding
in the cheap girl a dame of sixty weighing not far from two hundred
If it wasnt such awfully serious business for me he thought it
would be bettern going to a theater to see the two go on If I
havent got three peculiar females on my hands now Id like to hear
of the man that has

When Mrs Wiggins found that she could not gain her point she subsided
into utter silence It soon became evident in the cloudy light of the
moon that she was going to sleep for she so nodded and swayed about
that the farmer feared she would tumble out of the wagon She occupied
a seat just back of his and filled it too The idea of stepping over
sitting beside her and holding her in was inexpressibly repugnant to
him So he began talking to her and finally shouting at her to keep
her awake

His efforts were useless He glanced with rueful dismay over his
shoulder as he thought If she falls out I dont see how on earth
Ill ever get her back again

Fortunately the seat slipped back a little and she soon slid down into
a sort of mountainous heap on the bottom of the wagon as unmindful of
the rain as if it were a lullaby Now that his mind was at rest about
her falling out and knowing that he had a heavy load Holcroft let the
horses take their own time along the miry highway

Left to her own devices by Holcrofts absence Mrs Mumpson had passed
what she regarded as a very eventful afternoon and evening Not that
anything unusual had happened unless everything she said and did may
be looked upon as unusual but Mrs Mumpson justly felt that the
critical periods of life are those upon which definite courses of
action are decided upon In the secret recess of her heartsupposing
her to possess such an organshe had partially admitted to herself
even before she had entered Holcrofts door that she might be
persuaded into marrying him but the inspection of his room much
deliberate thought and prolonged soliloquy had convinced her that she
ought to enter into nuptial relations as her thought formulated
itself It was a trait of Mrs Mumpsons active mind that when it
once entered upon a line of thought it was hurried along from
conclusion to conclusion with wonderful rapidity

While Jane made up Mr Holcrofts bed her mother began to inspect and
soon suffered keenly from every painful discovery The farmers meager
wardrobe and other belongings were soon rummaged over but one large
closet and several bureau drawers were locked These are the
receptercles of the deceased Mrs Holcrofts affects she said with
compressed lips They are moldering useless away Moth and rust will
enter while I the caretaker am debarred I should not be debarred
All the things in that closet should be shaken out aired and
carefully put back Who knows how useful they may be in the future
Waste is wicked Indeed there are few things more wicked than waste
Now I think of it I have some keys in my trunk

He wont like it interposed Jane

In the responserble persition I have assumed replied Mrs Mumpson
with dignity I must consider not what he wants but what is best for
him and what may be best for others

Jane had too much curiosity herself to make further objection and the
keys were brought It was astonishing what a number of keys Mrs
Mumpson possessed and she was not long in finding those which would
open the ordinary locks thought by Holcroft to be ample protection

I was right said Mrs Mumpson complacently A musty odor exudes
from these closed receptercles Men have no comprehension of the need
of such caretakers as I am

Everything that had ever belonged to poor Mrs Holcroft was pulled out
taken to the window and examined Jane following as usual in the
wake of her mother and putting everything to the same tests which her
parent applied Mrs Holcroft had been a careful woman and the extent
and substantial character of her wardrobe proved that her husband had
not been close in his allowances to her Mrs Mumpsons watery blue
eyes grew positively animated as she felt of and held up to the light
one thing after another Mrs Holcroft was evidently unnaturally
large she reflected aloud but then these things could be made over
and much material be left to repair them from time to time The
dresses are of somber colors becoming to a lady somewhat advanced in
years and of subdued taste

By the time that the bed and all the chairs in the room were littered
with wearing apparel Mrs Mumpson said Jane I desire you to bring
the rocking chair So many thoughts are crowding upon me that I must
sit down and think

Jane did as requested but remarked The sun is gettin low and all
these thingsll have to be put back just as they was or hell be awful
mad

Yes Jane replied Mrs Mumpson abstractedly and rocking gently you
can put them back Your mind is not burdened like mine and you
havent offspring and the future to provide for and for a wonder
she relapsed into silence Possibly she possessed barely enough of
womanhood to feel that her present train of thought had better be kept
to herself She gradually rocked faster and faster thus indicating
that she was rapidly approaching a conclusion

Meanwhile Jane was endeavoring to put things back as they were before
and found it no easy task As the light declined she was overcome by a
sort of panic and huddling the things into the drawers as fast as
possible she locked them up Then seizing her mothers hand and
pulling the abstracted woman to her feet she cried If he comes and
finds us here and no supper ready hell turn us right out into the
rain

Even Mrs Mumpson felt that she was perhaps reaching conclusions too
fast and that some diplomacy might be necessary to consummate her
plans Her views however appeared to her so reasonable that she
scarcely thought of failure having the happy faculty of realizing
everything in advance whether it ever took place or not

As she slowly descended the stairs with the rocking chair she thought
Nothing could be more suiterble We are both about the same age I am
most respecterbly connectedin fact I regard myself as somewhat his
superior in this respect he is painfully undeveloped and irreligious
and thus is in sore need of female influence he is lonely and
downhearted and in womans voice there is a spell to banish care
worst of all things are going to waste I must delibrately face the
great duty with which Providence has brought me face to face At
first he may be a little blind to this great oppertunity of his
lifethat I must expect remembering the influence he was under so
many yearsbut I will be patient and by the proper use of language
place everything eventually before him in a way that will cause him to
yield in glad submission to my views of the duties the privileges and
the responserbilities of life

So active was Mrs Mumpsons mind that this train of thought was
complete by the time she had ensconced herself in the rocking chair by
the fireless kitchen stove Once more Jane seized her hand and dragged
her up You must help said the child I spect him every minnit and
Im scart half to death to think what hell do specially if he finds
out weve been rummagin

Jane said Mrs Mumpson severely that is not a proper way of
expressing yourself I am housekeeper here and Ive been inspecting

Shall I tell him youve been inspectin asked the girl keenly

Children of your age should speak when they are spoken to replied
her mother still more severely You cannot comprehend my motives and
duties and I should have to punish you if you passed any remarks upon
my actions

Well said Jane apprehensively I only hope well soon have a chance
to fix up them drawers for if he should open em wed have to tramp
again and we will anyway if you dont help me get supper

You are mistaken Jane responded Mrs Mumpson with dignity We
shall not leave this roof for three months and that will give me ample
time to open his eyes to his true interests I will condescend to
these menial tasks until he brings a girl who will yield the deference
due to my years and station in life

Between them after filling the room with smoke they kindled the
kitchen fire Jane insisted on making the coffee and then helped her
mother to prepare the rest of the supper doing in fact the greater
part of the work Then they sat down to wait and they waited so long
that Mrs Mumpson began to express her disapproval by rocking
violently At last she said severely Jane we will partake of
supper alone

Id ruther wait till he comes

Its not proper that we should wait He is not showing me due
respect Come do as I command

Mrs Mumpson indulged in lofty and aggrieved remarks throughout the
meal and then returned to her rocker At last her indignant sense of
wrong reached such a point that she commanded Jane to clear the table
and put away the things

I wont said the child

What Will you compel me to chastise you

Well then Ill tell him it was all your doins

I shall tell him so myself I shall remonstrate with him The idea
of his coming home alone at this time of night with an unknown female

One would think you was his aunt to hear you talk remarked the girl
sullenly

I am a respecterble woman and most respecterbly connected My
character and antercedents render me irrerproachfulThis could not be
said of a hussy and a hussy hell probably bringsome flighty
immerture female that will tax even MY patience to train

Another hour passed and the frown on Mrs Mumpsons brow grew
positively awful To think she muttered that a man whom I have
deemed it my duty to marry should stay out so and under such peculiar
circumstances He must have a lesson which he can never forget Then
aloud to Jane Kindle a fire on the parlor hearth and let this fire
go out He must find us in the most respecterble room in the housea
room befitting my station

I declare mother you aint got no sense at all exclaimed the child
exasperated beyond measure

Ill teach you to use such unrerspectful language cried Mrs
Mumpson darting from her chair like a hawk and pouncing upon the
unhappy child

With ears tingling from a cuffing she could not soon forget Jane
lighted the parlor fire and sat down sniffling in the farthest corner

There shall be only one mistress in this house said Mrs Mumpson
who had now reached the loftiest plane of virtuous indignation and
its master shall learn that his practices reflect upon even me as well
as himself

At last the sound of horses feet were heard on the wet oozy ground
without The irate widow did not rise but merely indicated her
knowledge of Holcrofts arrival by rocking more rapidly

Hello there Jane he shouted bring a light to the kitchen

Jane remain said Mrs Mumpson with an awful look

Holcroft stumbled through the dark kitchen to the parlor door and
looked with surprise at the group before himMrs Mumpson apparently
oblivious and rocking as if the chair was possessed and the child
crying in a corner

Jane didnt you hear me call for a light he asked a little sharply

Mrs Mumpson rose with great dignity and began Mr Holcroft I wish
to remonstrate

Oh bother Ive brought a woman to help you and were both wet
through from this driving rain

Youve brought a strange female at this time of

Holcrofts patience gave say but he only said quietly You had better
have a light in the kitchen within two minutes I warn you both I
also wish some hot coffee

Mrs Mumpson had no comprehension of a man who could be so quiet when
he was angry and she believed that she might impress him with a due
sense of the enormity of his offense Mr Holcroft I scarcely feel
that I can meet a girl who has no more sense of decorum than to But
Jane striking a match revealed the fact that she was speaking to
empty air

Mrs Wiggins was at last so far aroused that she was helped from the
wagon and came shivering and dripping toward the kitchen She stood a
moment in the doorway and filled it blinking confusedly at the light
There was an absence of celerity in all Mrs Wiggins movements and
she was therefore slow in the matter of waking up Her aspect and
proportions almost took away Mrs Mumpsons breath Here certainly was
much to superintend much more than had been anticipated Mrs Wiggins
was undoubtedly a peculiar female as had been expected but she was
so elderly and monstrous that Mrs Mumpson felt some embarrassment in
her purpose to overwhelm Holcroft with a sense of the impropriety of
his conduct

Mrs Wiggins took uncertain steps toward the rocking chair and almost
crushed it as she sat down Ye gives a body a cold velcome she
remarked rubbing her eyes

Mrs Mumpson had got out of her way as a minnow would shun a leviathan
May I ask your name she gasped

Viggins Mrs Viggins

Oh indeed You are a married woman

No him a vidder Whats more him cold and drippin an ungry
Hi might a better stayed at the poorus than come to a place like
this

What almost screamed Mrs Mumpson are you a pauper

Hi tell ye him a vidder an good as you be for hall he said was
the sullen reply

To think that a respecterbly connected woman like me But for once
Mrs Mumpson found language inadequate Since Mrs Wiggins occupied
the rocking chair she hardly knew what to do and plaintively declared
I feel as if my whole nervous system was giving way

No arm ll be done hif hit does remarked Mrs Wiggins who was not
in an amiable mood

This from the female Im to superintend gasped the bewildered woman

Her equanimity was still further disturbed by the entrance of the
farmer who looked at the stove with a heavy frown

Why in the name of common sense isnt there a fire he asked and
supper on the table Couldnt you hear that it was raining and know
wed want some supper after a long cold ride

Mr Holcroft began the widow in some trepidation I dont
approvesuch irregular habits

Madam interrupted Holcroft sternly did I agree to do what you
approved of Your course is so peculiar that I scarcely believe you
are in your right mind You had better go to your room and try to
recover your senses If I cant have things in this house to suit me
Ill have no one in it Here Jane you can help

Mrs Mumpson put her handkerchief to her eyes and departed She felt
that this display of emotion would touch Holcrofts feelings when he
came to think the scene all over

Having kindled the fire he said to Jane You and Mrs Wiggins get
some coffee and supper in short order and have it ready when I come
in and he hastened out to care for his horses If the old woman was
slow she knew just how to make every motion effective and a good
supper was soon ready

Why didnt you keep up a fire Jane Holcroft asked

She wouldnt let me She said how you must be taught a lesson
replied the girl feeling that she must choose between two potentates
and deciding quickly in favor of the farmer She had been losing faith
in her mothers wisdom a long time and this nights experience had
banished the last shred of it

Some rather bitter words rose to Holcrofts lips but he restrained
them He felt that he ought not to disparage the mother to the child
As Mrs Wiggins grew warm and imbibed the generous coffee her
demeanor thawed perceptibly and she graciously vouchsafed the remark
Ven youre hout late hagin hill look hafter ye

Mrs Mumpson had not been so far off as not to hear Janes explanation
as the poor child found to her cost when she went up to bed



Chapter X

A Night of Terror

As poor dazed homeless Alida passed out into the street after the
revelation that she was not a wife and never had been she heard a
voice say Well Hanner wasnt long in bouncing the woman I guess
wed better go up now Ferguson will need a lesson that he wont soon
forget

The speaker of these words was Mrs Fergusons brother William
Hackman and his companion was a detective The wife had laid her
still sleeping child down on the lounge and was coolly completing
Alidas preparations for dinner Her husband had sunk back into a chair
and again buried his face in his hands He looked up with startled
bloodshot eyes as his brotherinlaw and the stranger entered and then
resumed his former attitude

Mrs Ferguson briefly related what had happened and then said Take
chairs and draw up

I dont want any dinner muttered the husband

Mr William Hackman now gave way to his irritation Turning to his
brother he relieved his mind as follows See here Hank Ferguson if
you hadnt the best wife in the land this gentleman would now be
giving you a promenade to jail Ive left my work for weeks and spent
a sight of money to see that my sister got her rights and by thunder
shes going to have em Weve agreed to give you a chance to brace up
and be a man If we find out there isnt any man in you then you go
to prison and hard labor to the full extent of the law Weve fixed
things so you cant play any more tricks This man is a private
detective As long as you do the square thing by your wife and child
youll be let alone If you try to sneak off youll be nabbed Now
if you aint a scamp down to your heeltaps get up out of that chair
like a man treat your wife as she deserves for letting you off so
easy and dont make her change her mind by acting as if you and not
her was the wronged person

At heart Ferguson was a weak cowardly selfish creature whose chief
aim in life was to have things to suit himself When they ceased to be
agreeable he was ready for a change without much regard for the means
to his ends He had always foreseen the possibility of the event which
had now taken place but like all selfindulgent natures had hoped
that he might escape detection

Alida moreover had won a far stronger hold upon him than he had once
imagined possible He was terribly mortified and cast down by the
result of his experiment as he regarded it But the thought of a
prison and hard labor speedily drew his mind away from this aspect of
the affair He had been fairly caught his lark was over and he soon
resolved that the easiest and safest way out of the scrape was the best
way He therefore raised his head and came forward with a penitent air
as he said Its natural I should be overwhelmed with shame at the
position in which I find myself But I see the truth of your words
and Ill try to make it all right as far as I can Ill go back with
you and Hannah to my old home Ive got money in the bank Ill sell
out everything here and Ill pay you William as far as I can what
youve spent Hannah is mighty good to let me off so easy and she
wont be sorry This man is witness to what I say and the detective
nodded

Why Ferguson said Mr Hackman effusively now youre talking like
a man Come and kiss him Hannah and make it all up

Thats the way with you men said the woman bitterly These things
count for little Henry Ferguson must prove hes honest in what he
says by deeds not words Ill do as Ive said if he acts square and
thats enough to start with

All right said Ferguson glad enough to escape the caress Ill do
as I say

He did do all he promised and very promptly too He was not capable
of believing that a woman wronged as Alida had been would not prosecute
him and he was eager to escape to another state and in a certain
measure again to hide his identity under his own actual name

Meanwhile how fared the poor creature who had fled driven forth by
her first wild impulse to escape from a false and terrible position
With every step she took down the dimly lighted street the abyss into
which she had fallen seemed to grow deeper and darker She was
overwhelmed with the magnitude of her misfortune She shunned the
illumined thoroughfares with a halfcrazed sense that every finger
would be pointed at her Her final words spoken to Ferguson were the
last clear promptings of her womanly nature After that everything
grew confused except the impression of remediless disaster and shame
She was incapable of forming any correct judgment concerning her
position The thought of her pastor filled her with horror He she
thought would take the same view which the woman had so brutally
expressedthat in her eagerness to be married she had brought to the
parsonage an unknown man and had involved a clergyman in her own
scandalous recordIt would all be in the papers and her pastors
name mixed up in the affair She would rather die than subject him to
such an ordeal Long after when he learned the facts in the case he
looked at her very sadly as he asked Didnt you know me better than
that Had I so failed in my preaching that you couldnt come straight
to me

She wondered afterward that she had not done this but she was too
morbid too close upon absolute insanity to do what was wise and safe
She simply yielded to the wild impulse to escape to cower to hide
from every human eye hastening through the darkest obscurest streets
not caring where In the confusion of her mind she would retrace her
steps and soon was utterly lost wandering she knew not whither As
it grew late casual passersby looked after her curiously rough men
spoke to her and others jeered She only hastened on driven by her
desperate trouble like the wild ragged clouds that were flying across
the stormy March sky

At last a policeman said gruffly Youve passed me twice You cant
be roaming the streets at this time of night Why dont you go home

Standing before him and wringing her hands she moaned I have no
home

Where did you come from

Oh I cant tell you Take me to any place where a woman will be safe

I cant take you to any place now but the station house

But can I be alone there I wont be put with anybody

No no of course not Youll be better off there Come along
Taint far

She walked beside him without a word

Youd better tell me something of your story Perhaps I can do more
for you in the morning

I cant Im a stranger I havent any friends in town

Well well the sergeant will see what can be done in the morning
Youve been up to some foolishness I suppose and youd better tell
the whole story to the sergeant

She soon entered the station house and was locked up in a narrow cell
She heard the grating of the key in the lock with a sense of relief
feeling that she had at least found a temporary place of refuge and
security A hard board was the only couch it possessed but the
thought of sleep did not enter her mind Sitting down she buried her
face in her hands and rocked back and forth in agony and distraction
until day dawned At last someoneshe felt she could not raise her
eyes to his facebrought her some breakfast and coffee She drank the
latter but left the food untasted Finally she was led to the
sergeants private room and told that she must give an account of
herself If you cant or wont tell a clear story the officer
threatened youll have to go before the justice in open court and he
may commit you to prison If youll tell the truth now it may be that
I can discharge you You had no business to be wandering about the
streets like a vagrant or worse but if you were a stranger or lost and
hadnt sense enough to go where youd be cared for I can let you go

Oh said Alida again wringing her hands and looking at the officer
with eyes so full of misery and fear that he began to soften I dont
know where to go

Havent you a friend or acquaintance in town

Not one that I can go to

Why dont you tell me your story Then Ill know what to do and
perhaps can help you You dont look like a depraved woman

Im not God knows Im not

Well my poor woman Ive got to act in view of what I know not what
God knows

If I tell my story will I have to give names

No not necessarily It would be best though

I cant do that but Ill tell you the truth I will swear it on the
Bible I married someone A good minister married us The man deceived
me He was already married and last night his wife came to my happy
home and proved before the man whom I thought my husband that I was no
wife at all He couldnt didnt deny it Oh Oh Oh And she
again rocked back and forth in uncontrollable anguish Thats all
she added brokenly I had no right to be near him or her any longer
and I rushed out I dont remember much more My brain seemed on
fire I just walked and walked till I was brought here

Well well said the sergeant sympathetically you have been treated
badly outrageously but you are not to blame unless you married the
man hastily and foolishly

Thats what everyone will think but it dont seem to me that I did
Its a long story and I cant tell it

But you ought to tell it my poor woman You ought to sue the man for
damages and send him to State prison

No no cried Alida passionately I dont want to see him again and
I wont go to a court before people unless I am dragged there

The sergeant looked up at the policeman who had arrested her and said
This story is not contrary to anything you saw

No sir she was wandering about and seemed half out of her mind

Well then I can let you go

But I dont know where to go she replied looking at him with
hunted hollow eyes I feel as if I were going to be sick Please
dont turn me into the streets Id rather go back to the cell

That wont answer Theres no place that I can send you to except the
poorhouse Havent you any money

No sir I just rushed away and left everything when I learned the
truth

Tom Watterlys hotel is the only place for her said the policeman
with a nod

Oh I cant go to a hotel

He means the almshouse explained the sergeant What is your name

Alidathats all now Yes Im a pauper and I cant work just yet
Ill be safe there wont I

Certainly safe as in your mothers house

Oh mother mother thank God you are dead

Well I AM sorry for you said the sergeant kindly Taint often we
have so sad a case as yours If you say so Ill send for Tom
Watterly and he and his wife will take charge of you After a few
days your mind will get quieter and clearer and then youll prosecute
the man who wronged you

Ill go to the poorhouse until I can do better she replied wearily
Now if you please Ill return to my cell where I can be alone

Oh we can give you a better room than that said the sergeant Show
her into the waiting room Tim If you prosecute we can help you with
our testimony Goodbye and may you have better days

Watterly was telegraphed to come down with a conveyance for the
almshouse was in a suburb In due time he appeared and was briefly
told Alidas story He swore a little at the mean cuss the author
of all the trouble and then took the stricken woman to what all his
acquaintances facetiously termed his hotel



Chapter XI

Baffled

In the general consciousness Nature is regarded as feminine and even
those who love her most will have to adopt Mrs Mumpsons oftexpressed
opinion of the sex and admit that she is sometimes a peculiar female
During the month of March in which our story opens there was scarcely
any limit to her varying moods It would almost appear that she was
taking a mysterious interest in Holcrofts affairs but whether it was
a kindly interest or not one might be at a loss to decide When she
caught him away from home she pelted him with the coldest of rain and
made his house with even Mrs Mumpson and Jane abiding there seem a
refuge In the morning after the day on which he had brought or in a
sense had carted Mrs Wiggins to his domicile Nature was evidently
bent on instituting contrasts between herself and the rival phases of
femininity with which the farmer was compelled to associate It may
have been that she had another motive and was determined to keep her
humble worshiper at her feet and to render it impossible for him to
make the changes toward which he had felt himself driven

Being an early riser he was up with the sun and the sun rose so
serenely and smiled so benignly that Holcrofts clouded brow cleared in
spite of all that had happened or could take place The rain which
had brought such discomfort the night before had settled the ground
and made it comparatively firm to his tread The southern breeze which
fanned his cheek was as soft as the air of May He remembered that it
was Sunday and that beyond feeding his stock and milking he would
have nothing to do He exulted in the unusual mildness and thought
with an immense sense of relief I can stay outdoors nearly all day
He resolved to let his help kindle the fire and get breakfast as they
could and to keep out of their way Whatever changes the future might
bring he would have one more long day in rambling about his fields and
in thinking over the past Feeling that there need be no haste about
anything he leisurely inhaled the air fragrant from springing grass
and listened with a vague undefined pleasure to the ecstatic music of
the bluebirds songsparrows and robins If anyone had asked him why
he liked to hear them he would have replied Im used to em When
they come I know that plowing and planting time is near

It must be admitted that Holcrofts enjoyment of spring was not very
far removed from that of the stock in his barnyard All the animal
creation rejoices in the returning sun and warmth A subtle powerful
influence sets the blood in more rapid motion kindles new desires and
awakens a glad expectancy All that is alive becomes more thoroughly
alive and existence in itself is a pleasure Spring had always brought
to the farmer quickened pulses renewed activity and hopefulness and
he was pleased to find that he was not so old and cast down that its
former influence had spent itself Indeed it seemed that never before
had his fields his stock and outdoor workand these comprised Nature
to himbeen so attractive They remained unchanged amid the sad
changes which had clouded his life and his heart clung more
tenaciously than ever to old scenes and occupations They might not
bring him happiness again but he instinctively felt that they might
insure a comfort and peace with which he could be content

At last he went to the barn and began his work doing everything
slowly and getting all the solace he could from the tasks The horses
whinnied their welcome and he rubbed their noses caressingly as he fed
them The cows came briskly to the rack in which he foddered them in
pleasant weather and when he scratched them between the horns they
turned their mild Junolike eyes upon him with undisguised affection
The chickens clamoring for their breakfast followed so closely that
he had to be careful where he stepped Although he knew that all this
good will was based chiefly on the hope of food and the remembrance of
it in the past nevertheless it soothed and pleased him He was in
sympathy with this homely life it belonged to him and was dependent on
him it made him honest returns for his care Moreover it was
agreeably linked with the past There were quiet cows which his wife
had milked clucking biddies which she had lifted from nests with their
downy broods He looked at them wistfully and was wondering if they
ever missed the presence that he regretted so deeply when he became
conscious that Janes eyes were upon him How long she had been
watching him he did not know but she merely said Breakfasts ready
and disappeared

With a sigh he went to his room to perform his ablutions remembering
with a slight pang how his wife always had a basin and towel ready for
him in the kitchen In the breaking up of just such homely customs he
was continually reminded of his loss

On awakening to the light of this Sabbath morning Mrs Mumpson had
thought deeply and reasoned everything out again She felt that it
must be an eventful day and that there was much to be accomplished In
the first place there was Mrs Wiggins She disapproved of her
decidedly She isnt the sort of person that I would prefer to
superintend she remarked to Jane while making a toilet which she
deemed befitting the day and the hour will assuredly come when Mr
Holcroft will look upon her in the light that I do He will eventually
realize that I cannot be brought in such close relationship with a
pauper Not that the relationship is exactly close but then I shall
have to speak to herin brief to superintend her My eyes will be
offended by her vast proportions and uncouth appearance The floor
creaks beneath her tread and affects my nerves seriously Of course
while she is here I shall zealously as befits one in my responserble
position try to render useful such service as she can perform But
then the fact that I disapprove of her must soon become evident When
it is discovered that I only tolerate her there will be a change I
cannot show my disapproval very strongly today for this is a day set
apart for sacred things and Mrs Viggins as she called herselfI
cannot imagine a Mr Viggins for no man in his senses could have
married such a creatureas I was saying Mrs Viggins is not at all
sacred and I must endeavor to abstract my mind from her till tomorrow
as far as posserble My first duty today is to induce Mr Holcroft to
take us to church It will give the people of Oakville such a pleasing
impression to see us driving to church Of course I may fail Mr
Holcroft is evidently a hardened man All the influences of his life
have been adverse to spiritual development and it may require some
weeks of my influence to soften him and awaken yearnings for what he
has not yet known

He may be yearnin for breakfast Jane remarked completing her
toilet by tying her little pigtail braid with something that had once
been a bit of black ribbon but was now a string Youd better come
down soon and help

If Mrs Viggins cannot get breakfast I would like to know what she is
here for continued Mrs Mumpson loftily and regardless of Janes
departure I shall decline to do menial work any longer especially on
this sacred day and after I have made my toilet for church Mr
Holcroft has had time to think My disapproval was manifest last night
and it has undoubtedly occurred to him that he has not conformed to the
proprieties of life Indeed I almost fear I shall have to teach him
what the proprieties of life are He witnessed my emotions when he
spoke as he should not have spoken to ME But I must make allowances
for his unregenerate state He was cold and wet and hungry last
night and men are unreasonerble at such times I shall now heap coals
of fire upon his head I shall show that I am a meek forgiving
Christian woman and he will relent soften and become penitent Then
will be my opportunity and she descended to the arena which should
witness her efforts

During the period in which Mrs Mumpson had indulged in these lofty
reflections and selfcommunings Mrs Wiggins had also arisen I am
not sure whether she had thought of anything in particular or not She
may have had some spiritual longings which were not becoming to any day
of the week Being a woman of deeds rather than of thought probably
not much else occurred to her beyond the duty of kindling the fire and
getting breakfast Jane came down and offered to assist but was
cleared out with no more scruple than if Mrs Wiggins had been one of
the muchvisited relatives

The hidee she grumbled of avin sich a little trollop round
hunder my feet

Jane therefore solaced herself by watching the cheap girl till her
mother appeared

Mrs Mumpson sailed majestically in and took the rocking chair
mentally thankful that it had survived the crushing weight imposed upon
it the evening before Mrs Wiggins did not drop a courtesy Indeed
not a sign of recognition passed over her vast immobile face Mrs
Mumpson was a little embarrassed I hardly know how to comport myself
toward that female she thought She is utterly uncouth Her manners
are unmistakerbly those of a pauper I think I will ignore her today
I do not wish my feelings ruffled or put out of harmony with the sacred
duties and motives which actuate me

Mrs Mumpson therefore rocked gently solemnly and strange to say
silently and Mrs Wiggins also proceeded with her duties but not in
silence for everything in the room trembled and clattered at her
tread Suddenly she turned on Jane and said Ere you little
baggage go and tell the master breakfasts ready

Mrs Mumpson sprang from her chair and with a voice choked with
indignation gasped Do you dare address my offspring thus

Yer vat

My child my daughter who is not a pauper but the offspring of a
most respecterble woman and respecterbly connected Im amazed Im
dumfoundered Im

Yere a bit daft him athinkin Then to Jane Vy dont ye go an
hearn yer salt

Jane I forbid But it had not taken Jane half a minute to decide
between the now jarring domestic powers and henceforth she would be at
Mrs Wiggins beck and call She can do somethin the child
muttered as she stole upon Holcroft

Mrs Mumpson sank back in her chair but her mode of rocking betokened
a perturbed spirit I will restrain myself till tomorrow and then
She shook her head portentously and waited till the farmer appeared
feeling assured that Mrs Wiggins would soon be taught to recognize her
station When breakfast was on the table she darted to her place
behind the coffeepot for she felt that there was no telling what this
awful Mrs Wiggins might not assume during this day of sacred
restraint But the expauper had no thought of presumption in her
masters presence and the rocking chair again distracted Mrs
Mumpsons nerves as it creaked under an unwonted weight

Holcroft took his seat in silence The widow again bowed her head
devoutly and sighed deeply when observing that the farmer ignored her
suggestion

I trust that you feel refreshed after your repose she said benignly

I do

It is a lovely morninga morning I may add befitting the sacred
day Nature is at peace and suggests that we and all should be at
peace

Theres nothing I like more Mrs Mumpson unless it is quiet

I feel that way myself You dont know what restraint I have put
upon myself that the sacred quiet of this day might not be disturbed
I have had strong provercation since I entered this apartment I will
forbear to speak of it till tomorrow in order that there may be
quietness and that our minds may be prepared for worship I feel that
it would be unseemly for us to enter a house of worship with thoughts
of strife in our souls At precisely what moment do you wish me to be
ready for church

I am not going to church Mrs Mumpson

Not going to church IIscarcely understand Worship is such a
sacred duty

You and Jane certainly have a right to go to church and since it is
your wish Ill take you down to Lemuel Weeks and you can go with
them

I dont want to go to Cousin Lemuels nor to church nuther Jane
protested

Why Mr Holcroft began the widow sweetly after youve once
harnessed up it will take but a little longer to keep on to the meeting
house It would appear so seemly for us to drive thither as a matter
of course It would be what the communerty expects of us This is not
our day that we should spend it carnally We should be
spirituallyminded We should put away things of earth Thoughts of
business and any unnecessary toil should be abhorrent I have often
thought that there was too much milking done on Sunday among farmers
I know they say it is essential but they all seem so prone to forget
that but one thing is needful I feel it borne in upon my mind Mr
Holcroft that I should plead with you to attend divine worship and
seek an uplifting of your thoughts You have no idea how differently
the day may end or what emotions may be aroused if you place yourself
under the droppings of the sanctuary

Im like Jane I dont wish to go said Mr Holcroft nervously

But my dear Mr Holcroftthe farmer fidgeted under this
addressthe very essence of true religion is to do what we dont
wish to do We are to mortify the flesh and thwart the carnal mind
The more thorny the path of selfdenial is the more certain its the
right path Ive already entered upon it she continued turning a
momentary glare upon Mrs Wiggins Never before was a respecterble
woman so harrowed and outraged but I am calm I am endeavoring to
maintain a frame of mind suiterble to worship and I feel it my bounden
duty to impress upon you that worship is a necessity to every human
being My conscience would not acquit me if I did not use all my
influence

Very well Mrs Mumpson you and your conscience are quits You have
used all your influence I will do as I saidtake you to Lemuel
Weeksand you can go to church with his family and he rose from the
table

But Cousin Lemuel is also painfully blind to his spiritual interests

Holcroft did not stay to listen and was soon engaged in the morning
milking Jane flatly declared that she would not go to Cousin Lemuels
or to church It dont do me no good nor you nuther she sullenly
declared to her mother

Mrs Mumpson now resolved upon a different line of tactics Assuming a
lofty spiritual air she commanded Jane to light a fire in the parlor
and retired thither with the rocking chair The elder widow looked
after her and ejaculated Vell hif she haint the craziest loon hi
hever eard talk Hif she vas blind she might a seen that the master
didnt vant hany sich lecturin clack

Having kindled the fire the child was about to leave the room when her
mother interposed and said solemnly Jane sit down and keep Sunday

Im going to help Mrs Wiggins if shell let me

You will not so demean yourself I wish you to have no relations
whatever with that female in the kitchen If you had proper
selfrespect you would never speak to her again

We aint visitin here If I cant work indoors Ill tell him Ill
work outdoors

Its not proper for you to work today I want you to sit there in the
corner and learn the Fifth Commandment

Aint you goin to Cousin Lemuels

On mature reflection I have decided to remain at home

I thought you would if you had any sense left You know well enough
we aint wanted down there Ill go tell him not to hitch up

Well I will permit you to do so Then return to your Sunday task

Im goin to mind him responded the child She passed rapidly and
apprehensively through the kitchen but paused on the doorstep to make
some overtures to Mrs Wiggins If that austere dame was not to be
propitiated a line of retreat was open to the barn Say she began
to attract attention

Vell youngun replied Mrs Wiggins rendered more pacific by her
breakfast

Dont you want me to wash up the dishes and put em away I know how

Hill try ye Hif ye breaks hanythink and the old woman nodded
volumes at the child

Ill be back in a minute said Jane A moment later she met Holcroft
carrying two pails of milk from the barnyard He was about to pass
without noticing her but she again secured attention by her usual
preface Say when she had a somewhat extended communication to make

Come to the dairy room Jane and say your say there said Holcroft
not unkindly

She aint goin to Cousin Lemuels said the girl from the door

What is she going to do

Rock in the parlor Say cant I help Mrs Wiggins wash up the dishes
and do the work

Certainly why not

Mother says I must sit in the parlor n learn Commandments n keep
Sunday

Well Jane which do you think you ought to do

I think I oughter work and if you and Mrs Wiggins will let me I
will work in spite of mother

I think that you and your mother both should help do the necessary
work today There wont be much

If I try and help Mrs Wiggins motherll bounce out at me She shook
me last night after I went upstairs and she boxed my ears cause I
wanted to keep the kitchen fire up last night

Ill go with you to the kitchen and tell Mrs Wiggins to let you help
and I wont let your mother punish you again unless you do wrong

Mrs Wiggins relying on Janes promise of help had sat down to the
solace of her pipe for a few minutes but was about to thrust it
hastily away on seeing Holcroft He reassured her by saying
goodnaturedly No need of that my good woman Sit still and enjoy
your pipe I like to smoke myself Jane will help clear away things
and I wish her to Youll find shes quite handy By the way have you
all the tobacco you want

Vell now master praps ye know the lowance down hat the poorus
vasnt sich as ud keep a body in vat yed call satisfyin smokin Hi
never ad henough ter keep down the ankerin

I suppose thats so You shall have half of my stock and when I go
to town again Ill get you a good supply I guess Ill light my pipe
too before starting for a walk

Bless yer art master ye makes a body comfterble Ven hi smokes
hi feels more hat ome and kind o contented like An hold ooman like
me haint got much left to comfort er but er pipe

Jane called Mrs Mumpson sharply from the parlor As there was no
answer the widow soon appeared in the kitchen door Smoking was one
of the unpardonable sins in Mrs Mumpsons eyes and when she saw Mrs
Wiggins puffing comfortably away and Holcroft lighting his pipe while
Jane cleared the table language almost failed her She managed to
articulate Jane this atmosphere is not fit for you to breathe on
this sacred day I wish you to share my seclusion

Mrs Mumpson I have told her to help Mrs Wiggins in the necessary
work Holcroft interposed

Mr Holcroft you dont realizemen never doJane is my offspring
and

Oh if you put it that way I shant interfere between mother and
child But I suppose you and Jane came here to work

If you will enter the parlor I will explain to you fully my views
and

Oh please excuse me said Holcroft hastily passing out I was just
starting for a walkIm bound to have one more day to myself on the
old place he muttered as he bent his steps toward an upland pasture

Jane seeing that her mother was about to pounce upon her ran behind
Mrs Wiggins who slowly rose and began a progress toward the irate
widow remarking as she did so Hill just shut the door twixt ye and
yer hoffspring and then ye kin say yer prayers hon the tother side

Mrs Mumpson was so overcome at the turn affairs had taken on this day
which was to witness such progress in her plans and hopes as to feel
the absolute necessity of a prolonged season of thought and soliloquy
and she relapsed without further protest into the rocking chair



Chapter XII

Jane

Holcroft was not long in climbing to a sunny nook whence he could see
not only his farm and dwelling but also the Oakville valley and the
little white spire of the distant meeting house He looked at this
lastnamed object wistfully and very sadly Mrs Mumpsons tirade
about worship had been without effect but the memories suggested by
the church were bittersweet indeed It belonged to the Methodist
denomination and Holcroft had been taken or had gone thither from
the time of his earliest recollection He saw himself sitting between
his father and mother a roundfaced urchin to whom the sermon was
unintelligible but to whom little Bessie Jones in the next pew was a
fact not only intelligible but very interesting She would turn
around and stare at him until he smiled then she would giggle until
her mother brought her rightaboutface with considerable emphasis
After this he saw the little boycould it have been
himselfnodding swaying and finally slumbering peacefully with his
head on his mothers lap until shaken into sufficient consciousness to
be half dragged half led to the door Once in the big springless
farm wagon he was himself again looking eagerly around to catch
another glimpse of Bessie Jones Then he was a big irreverent boy
shyly and awkwardly bent on mischief in the same old meeting house
Bessie Jones no longer turned and stared at him but he exultingly
discovered that he could still make her giggle on the sly Years
passed and Bessie was his occasional choice for a sleighride when the
long body of some farm wagon was placed on runners and boys and
girlsyoung men and women they almost thought themselveswere packed
in like sardines Something like selfreproach smote Holcroft even
now remembering how he had allowed his fancy much latitude at this
period paying attention to more than one girl besides Bessie and
painfully undecided which he liked best

Then had come the memorable year which had opened with a protracted
meeting He and Bessie Jones had passed under conviction at the same
time and on the same evening had gone forward to the anxious seat
From the way in which she sobbed one might have supposed that the
good simplehearted girl had terrible burdens on her conscience but
she soon found hope and her tears gave place to smiles Holcroft on
the contrary was terribly cast down and unable to find relief He
felt that he had much more to answer for than Bessie he accused
himself of having been a rather coarse vulgar boy he had made fun of
sacred things in that very meeting house more times than he liked to
think of and now for some reason could think of nothing else

He could not shed tears or get up much emotion neither could he rid
himself of the dull weight at heart The minister the brethren and
sisters prayed for him and over him but nothing removed his terrible
inertia He became a familiar form on the anxious seat for there was a
dogged persistence in his nature which prevented him from giving up
but at the close of each meeting he went home in a state of deeper
dejection Sometimes in returning he was Bessie Jones escort and
her happiness added to his gall and bitterness One moonlight night
they stopped under the shadow of a pine near her fathers door and
talked over the matter a few moments before parting Bessie was full
of sympathy which she hardly knew how to express Unconsciously in
her earnestnesshow well he remembered the actshe laid her hand on
his arm as she said James I guess I know whats the matter with you
In all your seeking you are thinking only of yourselfhow bad youve
been and all that I wouldnt think of myself and what I was any more
if I was you You aint so awful bad James that Id turn a cold
shoulder to you but you might think I was doing just that if ye stayed
away from me and kept saying to yourself I aint fit to speak to
Bessie Jones

Her face had looked sweet and compassionate and her touch upon his arm
had conveyed the subtle magic of sympathy Under her homely logic the
truth had burst upon him like sunshine In brief he had turned from
his own shadow and was in the light He remembered how in his deep
feeling he had bowed his head on her shoulder and murmured Oh
Bessie Heaven bless you I see it all

He no longer went to the anxious seat With this young girl and many
others he was taken into the church on probation Thereafter his
fancy never wandered again and there was no other girl in Oakville for
him but Bessie In due time he had gone with her to yonder meeting
house to be married It had all seemed to come about as a matter of
course He scarcely knew when he became formally engaged They kept
company together steadfastly for a suitable period and that seemed to
settle it in their own and everybody elses mind

There had been no change in Bessies quiet constant soul After her
words under the shadow of the pine tree she seemed to find it difficult
to speak of religious subjects even to her husband but her simple
faith had been unwavering and she had entered into rest without fear
or misgiving

Not so her husband He had his spiritual ups and downs but like
herself was reticent While she lived only a heavy storm kept them
from going to meeting but with Holcroft worship was often little
more than a form his mind being on the farm and its interests
Parents and relatives had died and the habit of seclusion from
neighborhood and church life had grown upon them gradually and almost
unconsciously

For a long time after his wifes death Holcroft had felt that he did
not wish to see anyone who would make references to his loss

He shrank from formal condolences as he would from the touch of a
diseased nerve When the minister called he listened politely but
silently to a general exhortation then muttered when left alone
Its all as he says I suppose but somehow his words are like the
medicines Bessie tookthey dont do any good

He kept up the form of his faith and a certain vague hope until the
night on which he drove forth the Irish revelers from his home In
remembrance of his rage and profanity on that occasion he silently and
in dreary misgiving concluded that he should not even to himself keep
up the pretense of religion any longer Ive fallen from gracethat
is if I ever had anywas a thought which did much to rob him of
courage to meet his other trials Whenever he dwelt on these subjects
doubts perplexities and resentment at his misfortunes so thronged his
mind that he was appalled so he strove to occupy himself with the
immediate present

Today however in recalling the past his thoughts would question the
future and the outcome of his experiences In accordance with his
simple downright nature he muttered I might as well face the truth
and have done with it I dont know whether Ill ever see my wife
again or not I dont know whether God is for me or against me
Sometimes I half think there isnt any God I dont know what will
become of me when I die Im sure of only one thingwhile I do live I
could take comfort in working the old place

In brief without ever having heard of the term he was an agnostic
but not one of the selfcomplacent superior type who fancy that they
have developed themselves beyond the trammels of faith and are ever
ready to make the world aware of their progress

At last he recognized that his long reverie was leading to despondency
and weakness he rose shook himself half angrily and strode toward
the house Im here and here Im going to stay he growled As long
as Im on my own land its nobodys business what I am or how I feel
If I cant get decent sensible women help Ill close up my dairy and
live here alone I certainly can make enough to support myself

Jane met him with a summons to dinner looking apprehensively at his
stern gloomy face Mrs Mumpson did not appear Call her he said
curtly

The literal Jane returned from the parlor and said unsympathetically
Shes got a hankchif to her eyes and says she dont want no dinner

Very well he replied much relieved

Apparently he did not want much dinner either for he soon started out
again Mrs Wiggins was not utterly wanting in the intuitions of her
sex and said nothing to break in upon her masters abstraction

In the afternoon Holcroft visited every nook and corner of his farm
laying out he hoped so much occupation for both hands and thoughts as
to render him proof against domestic tribulations

He had not been gone long before Mrs Mumpson called in a plaintive
voice Jane

The child entered the parlor warily keeping open a line of retreat to
the door You need not fear me said her mother rocking
pathetically My feelings are so hurt and crushed that I can only
bemoan the wrongs from which I suffer You little know Jane you
little know a mothers heart

No assented Jane I dunno nothin about it

What wonder then that I weep when even my child is so unnatural

I dunno how to be anything else but what I be replied the girl in
selfdefense

If you would only yield more to my guidance and influence Jane the
future might be brighter for us both If you had but stored up the
Fifth Commandment in memorybut I forbear You cannot so far forget
your duty as not to tell me how HE behaved at dinner

He looked awful glum and hardly said a word

Ahh exclaimed the widow the spell is working

If you aint aworkin tomorrow therell be a worse spell the girl
remarked

That will do Jane that will do You little understandhow should
you Please keep an eye on him and let me know how he looks and what
he is doing and whether his face still wears a gloomy or a penitent
aspect Do as I bid you Jane and you may unconsciously secure your
own wellbeing by obedience

Watching anyone was a far more congenial task to the child than
learning the Commandments and she hastened to comply Moreover she
had the strongest curiosity in regard to Holcroft herself She felt
that he was the arbiter of her fate So untaught was she that delicacy
and tact were unknown qualities Her one hope of pleasing was in work
She had no power of guessing that sly espionage would counterbalance
such service Another round of visiting was dreaded above all things
she was therefore exceedingly anxious about the future Mother may
be right she thought Praps she can make him marry her so we
neednt go away any more Praps shes taken the right way to bring a
man around and get him hooked as Cousin Lemuel said If I was goin
to hook a man though Id try another plan than mothers Id keep my
mouth shut and my eyes open Id see what he wanted and do it even
fore he spoke Fis big anuf I bet I could hook a man quickern she
can by usin her tongue stead of her hands

Janes scheme was not so bad a one but that it might be tried to
advantage by those so disposed Her matrimonial prospects however
being still far in the future it behooved her to make her present
existence as tolerable as possible She knew how much depended on
Holcroft and was unaware of any other method of learning his purposes
except that of watching him Both fearing and fascinated she dogged
his steps most of the afternoon but saw nothing to confirm her
mothers view that any spell was working She scarcely understood why
he looked so long at field thicket and woods as if he saw something
invisible to her

In planning future work and improvements the farmer had attained a
quieter and more genial frame of mind When therefore he sat down and
in glancing about saw Jane crouching behind a low hemlock he was more
amused than irritated He had dwelt on his own interests so long that
he was ready to consider even Janes for a while Poor child he
thought she doesnt know any better and perhaps has even been taught
to do such things I think Ill surprise her and draw her out a
little Jane come here he called

The girl sprang to her feet and hesitated whether to fly or obey
Dont be afraid added Holcroft I wont scold you Come

She stole toward him like some small wild fearful animal in doubt of
its reception Sit down there on that rock he said

She obeyed with a sly sidelong look and he saw that she kept her feet
gathered under her so as to spring away if he made the slightest
hostile movement

Jane do you think its right to watch people so he asked gravely

She told me to

Your mother

The girl nodded

But do you think its right yourself

Dunno Taint best if you get caught

Well Jane said Holcroft with something like a smile lurking in his
deepset eyes I dont think its right at all I dont want you to
watch me any more no matter who tells you to Will you promise not
to

The child nodded She seemed averse to speaking when a sign would
answer

Can I go now she asked after a moment

Not yet I want to ask you some questions Was anyone ever kind to
you

I dunno I suppose so

What would you call being kind to you

Not scoldin or cuffin me

If I didnt scold or strike you would you think I was kind then

She nodded but after a moments thought said and if you didnt look
as if you hated to see me round

Do you think Ive been kind to you

Kindern anybody else You sorter look at me sometimes as if I was a
rat I dont spose you can help it and I dont mind Id ruther
stay here and work than go avisitin again Why cant I work outdoors
when theres nothin for me to do in the house

Are you willing to workto do anything you can

Jane was not sufficiently politic to enlarge on her desire for honest
toil and honest bread she merely nodded Holcroft smiled as he asked
Why are you so anxious to work

Cause I wont feel like a stray cat in the house then I want to be
someers where Ive a right to be

Wouldnt they let you work down at Lemuel Weeks She shook her head

Why not he asked

They said I wasnt honest they said they couldnt trust me with
things cause when I was hungry I took things to eat

Was that the way you were treated at other places

Mostly

Jane asked Holcroft very kindly did anyone ever kiss you

Mother used to fore people It allus made me kinder sick

Holcroft shook his head as if this child was a problem beyond him and
for a time they sat together in silence At last he arose and said
Its time to go home Now Jane dont follow me walk openly at my
side and when you come to call me at any time come openly make a
noise whistle or sing as a child ought As long as you are with me
never do anything on the sly and well get along well enough

She nodded and walked beside him At last as if emboldened by his
words she broke out Say if mother married you you couldnt send us
away could you

Why do you ask such a question said Holcroft frowning

I was athinkin

Well he interrupted sternly never think or speak of such things
again

The child had a miserable sense that she had angered him she was also
satisfied that her mothers schemes would be futile and she scarcely
spoke again that day

Holcroft was more than angry he was disgusted That Mrs Mumpsons
design upon him was so offensively open that even this ignorant child
understood it and was expected to further it caused such a strong
revulsion in his mind that he half resolved to put them both in his
market wagon on the morrow and take them back to their relatives His
newly awakened sympathy for Jane quickly vanished If the girl and her
mother had been repulsive from the first they were now hideous in
view of their efforts to fasten themselves upon him permanently
Fancy then the climax in his feelings when as they passed the house
the front door suddenly opened and Mrs Mumpson emerged with clasped
hands and the exclamation Oh how touching Just like father and
child

Without noticing the remark he said coldly as he passed Jane go help
Mrs Wiggins get supper

His anger and disgust grew so strong as he hastily did his evening work
that he resolved not to endanger his selfcontrol by sitting down
within earshot of Mrs Mumpson As soon as possible therefore he
carried the new stove to his room and put it up The widow tried to
address him as he passed in and out but he paid no heed to her At
last he only paused long enough at the kitchen door to say Jane
bring me some supper to my room Remember you only are to bring it

Bewildered and abashed Mrs Mumpson rocked nervously I had looked
for relentings this evening a general softening she murmured and I
dont understand his bearing toward me Then a happy thought struck
her I see I see she cried softly and ecstatically He is
struggling with himself he finds that he must either deny himself my
society or yield at once The end is near

A little later she too appeared at the kitchen door and said with
serious sweetness Jane you can also bring me MY supper to the
parlor

Mrs Wiggins shook with mirth in all her vast proportions as she
remarked Jane ye can bring me MY supper from the stove to the table
ere and then vait hon yeself



Chapter XIII

Not Wife But Waif

Tom Watterlys horse was the pride of his heart It was a bobtailed
rawboned animal but as Tom complacently remarked to Alida He can
pass about anything on the roada boast that he let no chance escape
of verifying It was a terrible ordeal to the poor woman to go dashing
through the streets in an open wagon feeling that every eye was upon
her With head bowed down she employed her failing strength in
holding herself from falling out yet almost wishing that she might be
dashed against some object that would end her wretched life It
finally occurred to Tom that the woman at his side might not after her
recent experience share in his enthusiasm and he pulled up remarking
with a rough effort at sympathy Its a cussed shame youve been
treated so and as soon as youre ready Ill help you get even with
the scamp

Im not well sir said Alida humbly I only ask for a quiet place
where I can rest till strong enough to do some kind of work

Well well said Tom kindly dont lose heart Well do the best by
you we can That aint saying very much though for were full and
running over

He soon drew rein at the poorhouse door and sprang out IIfeel
strange Alida gasped

Tom caught the fainting woman in his arms and shouted Here Bill
Joe You lazy loons where are you

Three or four half wrecks of men shuffled to his assistance and
together they bore the unconscious woman to the room which was used as
a sort of hospital Some old crones gathered around with such
restoratives as they had at command Gradually the stricken woman
revived but as the whole miserable truth came back she turned her
face to the wall with a sinking of heart akin to despair At last from
sheer exhaustion feverish sleep ensued from which she often started
with moans and low cries One impression haunted hershe was falling
ever falling into a dark bottomless abyss

Hours passed in the same partial stupor filled with phantoms and
horrible dreams Toward evening she aroused herself mechanically to
take the broth Mrs Watterly ordered her to swallow then relapsed into
the same lethargy Late in the night she became conscious that someone
was kneeling at her bedside and fondling her She started up with a
slight cry

Dont be afraid its only me dear said a quavering voice

In the dim rays of a night lamp Alida saw an old woman with gray hair
falling about her face and on her night robe At first in her
confused feverish impressions the poor waif was dumb with
superstitious awe and trembled between joy and fear Could her mother
have come to comfort her in her sore extremity

Put yer head on me ould withered breast said the apparition an
yell know a mithers heart niver changes Ive been alookin for ye
and expectin ye these long weary years They said ye wouldnt come
backthat Id niver find ye agin but I knowed I wud and here ye are
in me arms me darlint Dont draw away from yer ould mither Dont ye
be afeard or shamed loike No matter what yeve done or where yeve
been or who yeve been with a mithers heart welcomes ye back jist the
same as when yes were a babby an slept on me breast A mithers heart
ud quench the fires o hell Id go inter the burnin flames o the
pit an bear ye out in me arms So niver fear Now that Ive found
ye yere safe Yell not run away from me agin Ill hould yeIll
hould ye back and the poor creature clasped Alida with such
conclusive energy that she screamed from pain and terror

Ye shall not get away from me ye shall not go back to evil ways
Whist whist Be aisy and let me plead wid ye Think how many long
weary years Ive looked for ye and waited for ye Niver have I slept
night or day in me watchin Ye may be so stained an lost an ruined
that the whole wourld will scorn ye yet not yer mither not yer ould
mither Oh Nora Nora why did ye rin away from me Wasnt I koind
No no ye cannot lave me agin and she threw herself on Alida whose
disordered mind was tortured by what she heard Whether or not it was a
more terrible dream than had yet oppressed her she scarcely knew but
in the excess of her nervous horror she sent out a cry that echoed in
every part of the large building Two old women rushed in and dragged
Alidas persecutor screaming away

Thats allus the way o it she shrieked As soon as I find me Nora
they snatches me and carries me off and I have to begin me watchin
and waitin and lookin agin

Alida continued sobbing and trembling violently One of the awakened
patients sought to assure her by saying Dont mind it so miss Its
only old crazy Kate Her daughter ran away from her years and years
agohow many no one knowsand when a young womans brought here she
thinks its her lost Nora They oughtnt a let her get out knowin
you was here

For several days Alidas reason wavered The nervous shock of her sad
experiences had been so great that it did not seem at all improbable
that she like the insane mother might be haunted for the rest of her
life by an overwhelming impression of something lost In her morbid
shaken mind she confounded the wrong she had received with guilt on her
own part Eventually she grew calmer and more sensible Although her
conscience acquitted her of intentional evil nothing could remove the
deeprooted conviction that she was shamed beyond hope of remedy For
a time she was unable to rally from nervous prostration meanwhile her
mind was preternaturally active presenting every detail of the past
until she was often ready to cry aloud in her despair

Tom Watterly took an unusual interest in her case and exhorted the
visiting physician to do his best for her She finally began to
improve and with the first return of strength sought to do something
with her feeble hands The bread of charity was not sweet

Although the place in which she lodged was clean and the coarse
unvarying fare abundant she shrank shuddering with each days clearer
consciousness from the majority of those about her Phases of life of
which she had scarcely dreamed were the common topics of conversation
In her mother she had learned to venerate gray hairs and it was an
awful shock to learn that so many of the feeble creatures about her
were coarse wicked and evildisposed How could their withered lips
frame the words they spoke How could they dwell on subjects that were
profanation even to such wrecks of womanhood as themselves

Moreover they persecuted her by their curiosity The good material in
her apparel had been examined and commented on her wedding ring had
been seen and its absence soon noted for Alida after gaining the
power to recall the past fully had thrown away the metal lie feeling
that it was the last link in a chain binding her to a loathed and hated
relationship Learning from their questions that the inmates of the
almshouse did not know her history she refused to reveal it thus
awakening endless surmises Many histories were made for her the
beldams vying with each other in constructing the worst one Poor Alida
soon learned that there was public opinion even in an almshouse and
that she was under its ban In dreary despondency she thought
Theyve found out about me If such creatures as these think Im
hardly fit to speak to how can I ever find work among good
respectable people

Her extreme depression the coarse vulgar and uncharitable natures by
which she was surrounded retarded her recovery By her efforts to do
anything in her power for others she disarmed the hostility of some of
the women and those that were more or less demented became fond of
her but the majority probed her wound by every look and word She was
a saint compared with any of these yet they made her envy their
respectability She often thought Would to God that I was as old and
ready to die as the feeblest woman here if I could only hold up my
head like her

One day a woman who had a child left it sleeping in its rude wooden
cradle and went downstairs The babe wakened and began to cry Alida
took it up and found a strange solace in rocking it to sleep again upon
her breast At last the mother returned glared a moment into Alidas
appealing eyes then snatched the child away with the cruel words
Dont ye touch my baby agin To think it ud been in the arms o the
loikes oye

Alida went away and sobbed until her strength was gone She found that
there were some others ostracized like herself but they accepted their
position as a matter of courseas if it belonged to them and was the
least of their troubles

Her strength was returning yet she was still feeble when she sent for
Mrs Watterly and asked Do you think Im strong enough to take a
place somewhere

You ought to know that better than me was the chilly reply

Do youdo you think I could get a place I would be willing to do
any kind of honest work not beyond my strength

You hardly look able to sit up straight Better wait till youre
stronger Ill tell my husband If applications come hell see about
it and she turned coldly away

A day or two later Tom came and said brusquely but not unkindly
Dont like my hotel hey What can you do

Im used to sewing but Id try to do almost anything by which I could
earn my living

Best thing to do is to prosecute that scamp and make him pay you a
good round sum

She shook her head decidedly I dont wish to see him again I dont
wish to go before people and have thethepast talked about Id
like a place with some kind quiet people who keep no other help
Perhaps they wouldnt take me if they knew but I would be so faithful
to them and try so heard to learn what they wanted

Thats all nonsense their not taking you Ill find you a place some
day but youre not strong enough yet Youd be brought right back
here Youre as pale as a ghostalmost look like one So dont be
impatient but give me a chance to find you a good place I feel sorry
for you and dont want you to get among folks that have no feelings
Dont you worry now chirk up and youll come out all right

II think that ifif Im employed the people who take me ought to
know said Alida with bowed head

Theyll be blamed fools if they dont think more of you when they do
know was his response Still that shall be as you please Ive
told only my wife and theyve kept mum at the police station so the
thing hasnt got into the papers

Alidas head bowed lower still as she replied I thank you My only
wish now is to find some quiet place in which I can work and be left to
myself

Very well said Tom goodnaturedly Cheer up Ill be on the
lookout for you

She turned to the window near which she was sitting to hide the tears
which his rough kindness evoked He dont seem to shrink from me as if
I wasnt fit to be spoken to she thought but his wife did Im
afraid people wont take me when they know

The April sunshine poured in at the window the grass was becoming
green a robin alighted on a tree nearby and poured out a jubilant
song For a few moments hope that had been almost dead in her heart
revived As she looked gratefully at the bird thanking it in her
heart for the song it darted upon a string hanging on an adjacent
spray and bore it to a crotch between two boughs Then Alida saw it
was building a nest Her womans heart gave way Oh she moaned I
shall never have a home again No place shared by one who cares for
me To work and to be tolerated for the sake of my work is all
thats left



Chapter XIV

A Pitched Battle

It was an odd household under Holcrofts roof on the evening of the
Sunday we have described The farmer in a sense had taken
sanctuary in his own room that he might escape the maneuvering wiles
of his tormenting housekeeper If she would content herself with
general topics he would try to endure her foolish highflown talk
until the three months expired but that she should speedily and openly
take the initiative in matrimonial designs was proof of such an
unbalanced mind that he was filled with nervous dread Hanged if one
can tell what such a silly hairbrained woman will do next he
thought as he brooded by the fire Sunday or no Sunday I feel as if
Id like to take my horsewhip and give Lemuel Weeks a piece of my mind

Such musings did not promise well for Mrs Mumpson scheming in the
parlor below but as we have seen she had the faculty of arranging
all future events to her mind That matters had not turned out in the
past as she had expected counted for nothing She was one who could
not be taught even by experience The most insignificant thing in
Holcrofts dwelling had not escaped her scrutiny and pretty accurate
guess as to value yet she could not see or understand the intolerable
disgust and irritation which her ridiculous conduct excited In a weak
mind egotism and selfishness beyond a certain point pass into
practical insanity All sense of delicacy of the fitness of things
is lost even the power to consider the rights and feelings of others
is wanting Unlike poor Holcroft Mrs Mumpson had few misgivings in
regard to coming years As she rocked unceasingly before the parlor
fire she arranged everything in regard to his future as well as her
own

Jane quite forgotten was oppressed with a miserable presentiment of
evil Her pinched but intense little mind was concentrated on two
factsHolcrofts anger and her mothers lack of sense From such
premises it did not take her long to reason out but one
conclusionvisitin again and this was the summing up of all evils
Now and then a tear would force its way out of one of her little eyes
but otherwise she kept her troubles to herself

Mrs Wiggins was the only complacent personage in the house and she
unbent with a garrulous affability to Jane which could be accounted
for in but one wayHolcroft had forgotten about his cider barrel
thereby unconsciously giving her the chance to sample its contents
freely She was now smoking her pipe with much content and indulging
in pleasing reminiscences which the facts of her life scarcely
warranted

Ven hi vas as leetle a gal as ye are she began and then she related
experiences quite devoid of the simplicity and innocence of childhood
The girl soon forgot her fears and listened with avidity until the old
dames face grew heavier if possible with sleep and she stumbled off
to bed

Having no wish to see or speak to her mother again the child blew out
the candle and stole silently up the stairway At last Mrs Mumpson
took her light and went noisily around seeing to the fastenings of
doors and windows I know he is listening to every sound from me and
he shall learn what a caretaker I am she murmured softly

Once out of doors in the morning with his foot on the native heath of
his farm Holcrofts hopefulness and courage always returned He was
half angry with himself at his nervous irritation of the evening
before If she becomes so cranky that I cant stand her Ill pay the
three months wages and clear her out he had concluded and he went
about his morning work with a grim purpose to submit to very little
nonsense

Cider is akin to vinegar and Mrs Wiggins liberal potations of the
evening before had evidently imparted a marked acidity to her temper
She laid hold of the kitchen utensils as if she had a spite against
them and when Jane confiding in her friendliness shown so recently
came down to assist she was chased out of doors with language we
forbear to repeat Mrs Mumpson therefore had no intimation of the
low state of the barometer in the region of the kitchen I have taken
time to think deeply and calmly she murmured The proper course has
been made clear to me He is somewhat uncouth he is silent and unable
to express his thoughts and emotionsin brief undeveloped he is
awfully irreligious Moth and rust are busy in this house much that
would be so useful is going to waste He must learn to look upon me as
the developer the caretaker a patient and healthful embodiment of
female influence I will now begin actively my mission of making him
an ornerment to society That mountainous Mrs Viggins must be
replaced by a deferential girl who will naturally look up to me How
can I be a true caretakerhow can I bring repose and refinement to
this dwelling with two hundred pounds of female impudence in my way
Mr Holcroft shall see that Mrs Viggins is an unseemly and jarring
discord in our home and she brought the rocking chair from the parlor
to the kitchen with a serene and lofty air Jane hovered near the
window watching

At first there was an ominous silence in respect to words Portentous
sounds increased however for Mrs Wiggins strode about with martial
tread making the boards creak and the dishes clatter while her red
eyes shot lurid and sanguinary gleams She would seize a dipper as if
it were a foe slamming it upon the table again as if striking an
enemy Under her vigorous manipulation kettles and pans resounded
with reports like firearms

Mrs Mumpson was evidently perturbed her calm superiority was
forsaking her every moment she rocked fastera sure indication that
she was not at peace At last she said with great dignity Mrs
Viggins I must request you to perform your tasks with less clamor My
nerves are not equal to this peculiar way of taking up and laying down
things

Vell jes ye vait a minute han hill show ye ow hi kin take hup
things han put em down hagin hout o my vay and before Mrs Mumpson
could interfere she found herself lifted chair and all bodily and
carried to the parlor Between trepidation and anger she could only
gasp during the transit and when left in the middle of the parlor
floor she looked around in utter bewilderment

It so happened that Holcroft on his way from the barn had seen Jane
looking in at the window and suspecting something amiss had arrived
just in time for the spectacle Convulsed with laughter he returned
hastily to the barn while Jane expressed her feelings whatever they
were by executing something like a hornpipe before the window

Mrs Mumpson however was not vanquished She had only made a
compulsory retreat from the scene of hostilities and after rallying
her shattered faculties advanced again with the chair How dared you
you disreputerble female she began

Mrs Wiggins turned slowly and ominously upon her Ye call me a
disrupterbul female hagin han ye vont find hit ealthy

Mrs Mumpson prudently backed toward the door before delivering her
return fire

Woman she cried are you out of your mind Dont you know Im
housekeeper here and that its my duty to superintend you and your
work

Vell then hill double ye hup hand put ye hon the shelf hof the
dresser han lock the glass door hon ye From hup there ye kin see all
thats goin hon and supintend to yer earts content and she
started for her superior officer

Mrs Mumpson backed so precipitately with her chair that it struck
against the door case and she sat down hard Seeing that Mrs Wiggins
was almost upon her she darted back into the parlor leaving the chair
as a trophy in the hands of her enemy Mrs Wiggins was somewhat
appeased by this second triumph and with the hope of adding gall and
bitterness to Mrs Mumpsons defeat she took the chair to her rivals
favorite rocking place lighted her pipe and sat down in grim
complacency Mrs Mumpson warily approached to recover a support
which from long habit had become moral as well as physical and her
indignation knew no bounds when she saw it creaking under the weight of
her foe It must be admitted however that her ire was not so great
that she did not retain the better part of valor for she stepped
back unlocked the front door and set it ajar On returning she
opened with a volubility that awed even Mrs Wiggins for a moment You
miserable mountainous pauper you interloper you unrefined
irresponserble unregenerate female do you know what you have done in
thus outraging ME Im a respecterble woman respecterbly connected
Im here in a responserble station When Mr Holcroft appears hell
drive you from the dwelling which you vulgarize Your presence makes
this apartment a den You are a wild beast

Him a vile beastes ham hi cried Mrs Wiggins at last stung into
action and she threw her lighted pipe at the open mouth that was
discharging highsounding epithets by the score

It struck the lintel over the widows head was shattered and sent
down upon her a shower of villainously smelling sparks Mrs Mumpson
shrieked and sought frantically to keep her calico wrapper from taking
fire Meanwhile Mrs Wiggins rose and took a step or two that she
might assist should there be any positive danger for she had not yet
reached a point of malignity which would lead her to witness calmly an
autodafe This was Janes opportunity Mrs Wiggins had alienated
this small and hitherto friendly power and now with a returning
impulse of loyalty it took sides with the weaker party The kitchen
door was on a crack the child pushed it noiselessly open darted
around behind the stove and withdrew the rocking chair

Mrs Wiggins brief anxiety and preoccupation passed and she stepped
backward again to sit down She did sit down but with such terrific
force that the stove and nearly everything else in the room threatened
to fall with her She sat helplessly for a bewildered moment while
Jane with the chair danced before her exclaiming tauntingly Thats
for chasing me out as if I was a cat

Noo hill chase ye both hout cried the ireful Wiggins scrambling to
her feet She made good her threat for Holcroft a moment later saw
mother and daughter the latter carrying the chair rushing from the
front door and Mrs Wiggins armed with a great wooden spoon waddling
after them her objurgations mingling with Mrs Mumpsons shrieks and
Janes shrill laughter The widow caught a glimpse of him standing in
the barn door and as if borne by the wind she flew toward him
crying He shall be my protector

He barely had time to whisk through a side door and close it after him
The widows impetuous desire to pant out the story of her wrongs
carried her into the midst of the barnyard where she was speedily
confronted by an unruly young heifer that could scarcely be blamed for
hostility to such a wildlooking object

The animal shook its head threateningly as it advanced Again the
widows shrieks resounded This time Holcroft was about to come to the
rescue when the beleaguered woman made a dash for the top of the
nearest fence reminding her amused lookeron of the night of her
arrival when she had perched like some strange sort of bird on the
wagon wheel

Seeing that she was abundantly able to escape alone the farmer
remained in concealment Although disgusted and angry at the scenes
taking place he was scarcely able to restrain roars of laughter
Perched upon the fence the widow called piteously for him to lift her
down but he was not to be caught by any such device At last giving
up hope and still threatened by the heifer she went over on the other
side Knowing that she must make a detour before reaching the
dwelling Holcroft went thither rapidly with the purpose of restoring
order at once Jane he said sternly take that chair to the parlor
and leave it there Let there be no more such nonsense

At his approach Mrs Wiggins had retreated sullenly to the kitchen
Come he ordered goodnaturedly hasten breakfast and let there be
no more quarreling

Hif hi vas left to do me work hin peace she began

Well you shall do it in peace

At this moment Mrs Mumpson came tearing in quite oblivious of the
fact that she had left a goodly part of her calico skirt on a nail of
the fence She was rushing toward Holcroft when he said sternly and
with a repellent gesture Stop and listen to me If theres any more
of this quarreling like cats and dogs in my house Ill send for the
constable and have you all arrested If you are not all utterly
demented and hopeless fools you will know that you came here to do my
work and nothing else Then catching a glimpse of Mrs Mumpsons
dress and fearing he should laugh outright he turned abruptly on his
heel and went to his room where he was in a divided state between
irrepressible mirth and vexation

Mrs Mumpson also fled to her room She felt that the proper course
for her at this juncture was a fit of violent hysterics but a prompt
douche from the water pitcher administered by the unsympathetic Jane
effectually checked the first symptoms Was ever a respecterble
woman

You aint respectable interrupted the girl as she departed You
look like a scarecrow Fis you Id begin to show some sense now



Chapter XV

What is to Become of Me

Holcrofts reference to a constable and arrest though scarcely
intended to be more than a vague threat had the effect of clearing the
air like a clap of thunder Jane had never lost her senses such as
she possessed and Mrs Wiggins recovered hers sufficiently to
apologize to the farmer when he came down to breakfast But that
Mumpsons hawfully haggravatin master as ye know yeself him
athinkin Vud ye jis tell a body vat she is here han ow him to
get hon vith er Hif him to take me horders from er hid ruther go
back to the poorus

You are to take your orders from me and no one else All I ask is
that you go on quietly with your work and pay no attention to her You
know well enough that I cant have such goings on I want you to let
Jane help you and learn her to do everything as far as she can Mrs
Mumpson can do the mending and ironing I suppose At any rate I
wont have any more quarreling and uproar Im a quiet man and intend
to have a quiet house You and Jane can get along very well in the
kitchen and you say you understand the dairy work

Vell hi does han noo hive got me horders hill go right along

Mrs Mumpson was like one who had been rudely shaken out of a dream
and she appeared to have sense enough to realize that she couldnt
assume so much at first as she anticipated She received from Jane a
cup of coffee and said feebly I can partake of no more after the
recent trying events

For some hours she was a little dazed but her mind was of too light
weight to be long cast down Jane rehearsed Holcrofts words
described his manner and sought with much insistence to show her
mother that she must drop her nonsense at once I can see it in his
eye said the girl that he wont stand much more If yer dont come
down and keep yer hands busy and yer tongue still well tramp As to
his marrying you bah Hed jes as soon marry Mrs Wiggins

This was awful prose but Mrs Mumpson was too bewildered and
discouraged for a time to dispute it and the household fell into a
somewhat regular routine The widow appeared at her meals with the air
of a meek and suffering martyr Holcroft was exceedingly brief in his
replies to her questions and paid no heed to her remarks After
supper and his evening work he went directly to his room Every day
however he secretly chafed with everincreasing discontent over this
tormenting presence in his house The mending and such work as she
attempted was so wretchedly performed that it would better have been
left undone She was also recovering her garrulousness and mistook
his toleration and her immunity in the parlor for proof of a growing
consideration He knows that my hands were never made for such coarse
menial tasks as that Viggins does she thought as she darned one of
his stockings in a way that would render it almost impossible for him
to put his foot into it again The events of last Monday morning were
unfortunate unforeseen unprecedented I was unprepared for such
vulgar barbarous unheardof proceedingstaken off my feet as it
were but now that hes had time to think it all over he sees that I
am not a common woman like VigginsMrs Mumpson would have suffered
rather than have accorded her enemy the prefix of Mrswho is only
fit to be among pots and kettles He leaves me in the parlor as if a
refined apartment became me and I became it Time and my influence
will mellow soften elevate develop and at last awaken a desire for
my society then yearnings My first error was in not giving myself
time to make a proper impression He will soon begin to yield like the
earth without First it is hard and frosty then it is cold and muddy
if I may permit myself so disagreeable an illustration Now he is
becoming mellow and soon every word I utter will be like good seed in
good ground How aptly it all fits I have only to be patient

She was finally left almost to utter idleness for Jane and Mrs
Wiggins gradually took from the incompetent hands even the light tasks
which she had attempted She made no protest regarding all as another
proof that Holcroft was beginning to recognize her superiority and
unfitness for menial tasks She would maintain however her character
as the caretaker and ostentatiously inspected everything she also
tried to make as much noise in fastening up the dwelling at night as if
she were barricading a castle Holcroft would listen grimly well
aware that no house had been entered in Oakville during his memory He
had taken an early occasion to say at the table that he wished no one
to enter his room except Jane and that he would not permit any
infringement of this rule Mrs Mumpsons feelings had been hurt at
first by this order but she soon satisfied herself that it had been
meant for Mrs Wiggins benefit and not her own She found however
that Jane interpreted it literally If either of you set foot in that
room Ill tell him she said flatly Ive had my orders and Im
agoin to obey Theres to be no more rummagin If youll give me
the keys Ill put things back in order agin

Well I wont give you the keys Im the proper person to put things
in order if you did not replace them properly You are just making an
excuse to rummage yourself My motive for inspecting is very different
from yours

Shouldnt wonder if you was sorry some day the girl had remarked
and so the matter had dropped and been forgotten

Holcroft solaced himself with the fact that Jane and Mrs Wiggins
served his meals regularly and looked after the dairy with better care
than it had received since his wife died If I had only those two in
the house I could get along firstrate he thought After the three
months are up Ill try to make such an arrangement Id pay the
mother and send her off now but if I did Lemuel Weeks would put her
up to a lawsuit

April days brought the longedfor plowing and planting and the farmer
was so busy and absorbed in his work that Mrs Mumpson had less and
less place in his thoughts even as a thorn in the flesh One bright
afternoon however chaos came again unexpectedly Mrs Wiggins did
not suggest a volatile creature yet such alas she was She
apparently exhaled and was lost leaving no trace The circumstances
of her disappearance permit of a very matteroffact and not very
creditable explanation On the day in question she prepared an
unusually good dinner and the farmer had enjoyed it in spite of Mrs
Mumpsons presence and desultory remarks The morning had been fine
and he had made progress in his early spring work Mrs Wiggins felt
that her hour and opportunity had come Following him to the door she
said in a low tone and yet with a decisive accent as if she was
claiming a right Master hid thank ye for me two weeks wages

He unsuspectingly and unhesitatingly gave it to her thinking Thats
the way with such people They want to be paid often and be sure of
their money Shell work all the better for having it

Mrs Wiggins knew the hour when the stage passed the house she had
made up a bundle without a very close regard to meum or tuum and was
ready to flit The chance speedily came

The caretaker was rocking in the parlor and would disdain to look
while Jane had gone out to help plant some early potatoes on a warm
hillside The coast was clear Seeing the stage coming the old woman
waddled down the lane at a remarkable pace paid her fare to town and
the Holcroft kitchen knew her no more

That she found the friend she had wished to see on her way out to the
farm and that this friend brought her quickly under Tom Watterlys
care again goes without saying

As the shadows lengthened and the robins became tuneful Holcroft said
Youve done well Jane Thank you Now you can go back to the house

The child soon returned in breathless haste to the field where the
farmer was covering the potato pieces she had dropped and cried Mrs
Wigginss gone

Like a flash the womans motive in asking for her wages occurred to
him but he started for the house to assure himself of the truth
Perhaps shes in the cellar he said remembering the cider barrel
or else shes out for a walk

No she aint persisted Jane Ive looked everywhere and all over
the barn and she aint nowhere Mother haint seen her nuther

With dreary misgivings Holcroft remembered that he no longer had a
practical ally in the old Englishwoman and he felt that a new breaking
up was coming He looked wistfully at Jane and thought I COULD get
along with that child if the other was away But that cant be SHED
visit here indefinitely if Jane stayed

When Mrs Mumpson learned from Jane of Mrs Wiggins disappearance she
was thrown into a state of strong excitement She felt that her hour
and opportunity might be near also and she began to rock very fast
What else could he expect of such a female she soliloquized Ive
no doubt but shes taken things too Hell now learn my value and
what it is to have a caretaker who will never desert him

Spirits and courage rose with the emergency her thoughts hurried her
along like a dry leaf caught in a March gale Yes she murmured the
time has come for me to act to dare to show him in his desperate need
and hour of desertion what might be may be must be He will now see
clearly the difference between these peculiar females who come and go
and a respecterble woman and a mother who can be depended uponone who
will never steal away like a thief in the night

She saw Holcroft approaching the house with Jane she heard him ascend
to Mrs Wiggins room then return to the kitchen and ejaculate Yes
shes gone sure enough

Now ACT murmured the widow and she rushed toward the farmer with
clasped hands and cried with emotion Yes shes gone but Im not
gone You are not deserted Jane will minister to you I will be the
caretaker and our home will be all the happier because that monstrous
creature is absent Dear Mr Holcroft dont be so blind to your own
interests and happiness dont remain undeveloped Everything is wrong
here if you would but see it You are lonely and desolate Moth and
rust have entered things in unopened drawers and closets are molding
and going to waste Yield to true female influence and

Holcroft had been rendered speechless at first by this onslaught but
the reference to unopened drawers and closets awakened a sudden
suspicion Had she dared to touch what had belonged to his wife
What he exclaimed sharply interrupting her then with an expression
of disgust and anger he passed her swiftly and went to his room A
moment later came the stern summons Jane come here

Now youll see whatll come of that rummagin whimpered Jane You
aint got no sense at all to go at him so Hes jes goin to put us
right out and she went upstairs as if to execution

Have I failed gasped Mrs Mumpson and retreating to the chair she
rocked nervously

Jane said Holcroft in hot anger my wifes things have been pulled
out of her bureau and stuffed back again as if they were no better than
dishcloths Who did it

The child now began to cry aloud

There there he said with intense irritation I cant trust you
either

I hainttouched emsince you told metold menot to do things on
the sly the girl sobbed brokenly but he had closed the door upon her
and did not hear

He could have forgiven her almost anything but this Since she only
had been permitted to take care of his room he naturally thought that
she had committed the sacrilege and her manner had confirmed this
impression Of course the mother had been present and probably had
assisted but he had expected nothing better of her

He took the things out folded and smoothed them as carefully as he
could with his heavy hands and clumsy fingers His gentle almost
reverent touch was in strange contrast with his flushed angry face and
gleaming eyes This is the worst thats happened yet he muttered
Oh Lemuel Weeks Its well you are not here now or we might both
have cause to be sorry It was you who put these prying and for all I
know thieving creatures into my house and it was as mean a trick as
ever one man played another You and this precious cousin of yours
thought you could bring about a marriage you put her up to her
ridiculous antics Faugh The very thought of it all makes me sick

Oh mother what shall I do Jane cried rushing into the parlor and
throwing herself on the floor hes goin to put us right out

He cant put me out before the three months are up quavered the
widow

Yes he can Weve been arummagin where wed no bizniss to be
Hes mad enough to do anything he jes looks awful Im afraid of him

Jane said her mother plaintively I feel indisposed I think Ill
retire

Yes thats the way with YOU sobbed the child You get me into the
scrape and now you retire

Mrs Mumpsons confidence in herself and her schemes was terribly
shaken I must act very discreetly I must be alone that I may think
over these untoward events Mr Holcroft has been so warped by the
past female influences of his life that theres no counting on his
action He taxes me sorely she explained and then ascended the
stairs

Oh Oh moaned the child as she writhed on the floor mother aint
got no sense at all What IS goin to become of me Id ruther hang
about his barn than go back to Cousin Lemuels or any other cousins

Spurred by one hope she at last sprung up and went to the kitchen It
was already growing dark and she lighted the lamp kindled the fire
and began getting supper with breathless energy

As far as he could discover Holcroft was satisfied that nothing had
been taken In this respect he was right Mrs Mumpsons curiosity
and covetousness were boundless but she would not steal There are
few who do not draw the line somewhere

Having tried to put the articles back as they were before he locked
them up and went hastily down and out feeling that he must regain his
selfcontrol and decide upon his future action at once I will then
carry out my purposes in a way that will give the Weeks tribe no chance
to make trouble

As he passed the kitchen windows he saw Jane rushing about as if
possessed and he stopped to watch her It soon became evident that
she was trying to get his supper His heart relented at once in spite
of himself The poor wronged child he muttered Why should I be so
hard on her for doing what shes been brought up to do Well well
its too bad to send her away but I cant help it Id lose my own
reason if the mother were here much longer and if I kept Jane her
idiotic mother would stay in spite of me If she didnt thered be
endless talk and lawsuits too like enough about separating parent
and child Janes too young and little anyway to be here alone and
do the work But Im sorry for her I declare I am and I wish I could
do something to give her a chance in the world If my wife was only
living wed take and bring her up disagreeable and homely as she is
but theres no use of my trying to do anything alone I fear after
all that I shall have to give up the old place and goI dont know
where What is to become of her



Chapter XVI

Mrs Mumpsons Vicissitudes

Having completed her preparations for supper Jane stole timidly up to
Holcrofts room to summon him Her first rap on his door was scarcely
audible then she ventured to knock louder and finally to call him but
there was no response Full of vague dread she went to her mothers
room and said He wont answer me Hes so awful mad that I dont
know what hell do

I think he has left his apartment her mother moaned from the bed

Why couldnt yer tell me so before cried Jane What yer gone to bed
for If youd only show some sense and try to do what he brought you
here for like enough hed keep us yet

My hearts too crushed Jane

Oh bother bother and the child rushed away She looked into the
dark parlor and called Mr Holcroft Then she appeared in the
kitchen again the picture of uncouth distress and perplexity A
moment later she opened the door and darted toward the barn

What do you wish Jane said Holcroft emerging from a shadowy corner
and recalling her

Supsuppersready sobbed the child

He came in and sat down at the table considerately appearing not to
notice her until she had a chance to recover composure She vigorously
used the sleeve of both arms in drying her eyes then stole in and
found a seat in a dusky corner

Why dont you come to supper he asked quietly

Dont want any

You had better take some up to your mother

She oughtnt to have any

That doesnt make any difference I want you to take up something to
her and then come down and eat your supper like a sensible girl

I aint been sensible nor mother nuther

Do as I say Jane The child obeyed but she couldnt swallow
anything but a little coffee

Holcroft was in a quandary He had not the gift of speaking soothing
yet meaningless words and was too honest to raise false hopes He was
therefore almost as silent and embarrassed as Jane herself To the
girls furtive scrutiny he did not seem hardened against her and she
at last ventured Say I didnt touch them drawers after you told me
not to do anything on the sly

When were they opened Tell me the truth Jane

Mother opened them the first day you left us alone I told her you
wouldnt like it but she said she was housekeeper she said how it was
her duty to inspect everything I wanted to inspect too We was jes
rummaginthats what it was After the things were all pulled out
mother got the rocker and wouldnt do anything It was gettin late
and I was frightened and poked em back in a hurry Mother wanted to
rummage agin the other day and I wouldnt let her then she wouldnt
let me have the keys so I could fix em up

But the keys were in my pocket Jane

Mother has a lot of keys Ive told you jes how it all was

Nothing was taken away

No Mother aint got sense but she never takes things I nuther
cept when Im hungry Never took anything here Say are you goin to
send us away

I fear I shall have to Jane Im sorry for you for I believe you
would try to do the best you could if given a chance and I can see you
never had a chance

No said the child blinking hard to keep the tears out of her eyes
I aint had no teachin Ive jes kinder growed along with the farm
hands and rough boys Them that didnt hate me teased me Say
couldnt I stay in your barn and sleep in the hay

Holcroft was sorely perplexed and pushed away his halfeaten supper
He knew himself what it was to be friendless and lonely and his heart
softened toward this worse than motherless child

Jane he said kindly Im just as sorry for you as I can be but you
dont know the difficulties in the way of what you wish and I fear I
cant make you understand them Indeed it would not be best to tell
you all of them If I could keep you at all you should stay in the
house and Id be kind to you but it cant be I may not stay here
myself My future course is very uncertain Theres no use of my
trying to go on as I have Perhaps some day I can do something for
you and if I can I will I will pay your mother her three months
wages in full in the morning and then I want you both to get your
things into your trunk and Ill take you to your Cousin Lemuels

Driven almost to desperation Jane suggested the only scheme she could
think of If you stayed here and I run away and came back wouldnt
you keep me Id work all day and all night jes for the sake of
stayin

No Jane said Holcroft firmly youd make me no end of trouble if
you did that If youll be a good girl and learn how to do things
Ill try to find you a place among kind people some day when youre
older and can act for yourself

Youre afraid fis here motherd come avisitin said the girl
keenly

Youre too young to understand half the trouble that might follow My
plans are too uncertain for me to tangle myself up You and your
mother must go away at once so I can do what I must do before its too
late in the season Heres a couple of dollars which you can keep for
yourself and he went up to his room feeling that he could not
witness the childs distress any longer

He fought hard against despondency and tried to face the actual
condition of his affairs I might have known he thought that
things would have turned out somewhat as they have with such women in
the house and I dont see much chance of getting better ones Ive
been so bent on staying and going on as I used to that Ive just shut
my eyes to the facts He got out an old account book and pored over
it a long time The entries therein were blind enough but at last he
concluded Its plain that Ive lost money on the dairy ever since my
wife died and the prospects now are worse than ever That Weeks tribe
will set the whole town talking against me and it will be just about
impossible to get a decent woman to come here I might as well have an
auction and sell all the cows but one at once After that if I find I
cant make out living alone Ill put the place in better order and
sell or rent I can get my own meals after a fashion and old Jonathan
Johnsons wife will do my washing and mending Its time it was done
better than it has been for some of my clothes make me look like a
scarecrow I believe Jonathan will come with his cross dog and stay
here too when I must be away Well well its a hard lot for a man
but Id be about as bad off and a hundredfold more lonely if I went
anywhere else

I can only feel my way along and live a day at a time Ill learn
what can be done and what cant be One thing is clear I cant go on
with this Mrs Mumpson in the house a day longer She makes me creep
and crawl all over and the first thing I know I shall be swearing like
a bloody pirate unless I get rid of her

If she wasnt such a hopeless idiot Id let her stay for the sake of
Jane but I wont pay her good wages to make my life a burden a day
longer and with like selfcommunings he spent the evening until the
habit of early drowsiness overcame him

The morning found Jane dispirited and a little sullen as older and
wiser people are apt to be when disappointed She employed herself in
getting breakfast carelessly and languidly and the result was not
satisfactory

Wheres your mother Holcroft asked when he came in

She told me to tell you she was indisposed

Indisposed to go to Lemuel Weeks

I spect she means shes sick

He frowned and looked suspiciously at the girl Here was a new
complication and very possibly a trick

Whats the matter with her

Dunno

Well she had better get well enough to go by this afternoon he
remarked controlling his irritation with difficulty and nothing more
was said

Full of his new plans he spent a busy forenoon and then came to dinner
It was the same old story He went up and knocked at Mrs Mumpsons
door saying that he wished to speak with her

Im too indisposed to transact business she replied feebly

You must be ready tomorrow morning he called I have business plans
which cant be delayed and he turned away muttering rather sulphurous
words

He will relent his hard heart will soften at last But we shall not
weary the reader with the long soliloquies with which she beguiled her
politic seclusion as she regarded it Poor unsophisticated Jane made
matters worse The condition of life among her muchvisited relatives
now existed again She was not wanted and her old sly sullen and
furtive manner reasserted itself Much of Holcrofts sympathy was thus
alienated yet he partially understood and pitied her It became
however all the more clear that he must get rid of both mother and
child and that further relations with either of them could only lead
to trouble

The following morning only Jane appeared Is your mother really sick
he asked

Spose so was the laconic reply

You havent taken much pains with the breakfast Jane

Taint no use

With knitted brows he thought deeply and silently ate the wretched
meal which had been prepared Then remarking that he might do some
writing he went up to a small attic room which had been used
occasionally by a hired man It contained a covered pipehole leading
into the chimney flue Removing the cover he stopped up the flue with
an old woolen coat I suppose Ill have to meet tricks with tricks
he muttered

Returning to his own apartment he lighted a fire in the stove and laid
upon the kindling blaze some dampened wood then went out and quietly
hitched his horses to the wagon

The pungent odor of smoke soon filled the house The cover over the
pipehole in Mrs Mumpsons room was not very secure and thick volumes
began to pour in upon the startled widow Jane she shrieked

If Jane was sullen toward Holcroft she was furious at her mother and
paid no heed at first to her cry

Jane Jane the house is on fire

Then the child did fly up the stairway The smoke seemed to confirm
the words of her mother who was dressing in hot haste Run and tell
Mr Holcroft she cried

I wont said the girl If he wont keep us in the house I dont
care if he dont have any house

No no tell him screamed Mrs Mumpson If we save his house he
will relent Gratitude will overwhelm him So far from turning us
away he will sue he will plead for forgiveness for his former
harshness his home saved will be our home won Just put our things in
the trunk first Perhaps the house cant be saved and you know we
must save OUR things Help me quick There there now nowboth
were sneezing and choking in a halfstrangled manner Now let me lock
it my hand trembles so take hold and draw it out drag it downstairs
no matter how it scratches things

Having reached the hall below she opened the door and shrieked for
Holcroft Jane also began running toward the barn The farmer came
hastily out and shouted Whats the matter

The house is on fire they screamed in chorus

To carry out his ruse he ran swiftly to the house Mrs Mumpson stood
before him wringing her hands and crying Oh dear Mr Holcroft cant
I do anything to help you I would so like to help you and

Yes my good woman let me get in the door and see whats the matter
Oh heres your trunk Thats sensible Better get it outside and
he went up the stairs two steps at a time and rushed into his room

Jane Jane ejaculated Mrs Mumpson sinking on a seat in the porch
he called me his good woman But Jane was busy dragging the trunk
out of doors Having secured her own and her mothers worldly
possessions she called Shall I bring water and carry things out

No he replied not yet Theres something the matter with the
chimney and he hastened up to the attic room removed the clog from
the flue put on the cover again and threw open the window
Returning he locked the door of the room which Mrs Mumpson had
occupied and came downstairs I must get a ladder and examine the
chimney he said as he passed

Oh my dear Mr Holcroft the widow began

Cant talk with you yet and he hastened on

As soon as hes sure the house is safe Jane all will be well

But the girl had grown hopeless and cynical She had not penetrated
his scheme to restore her mother to health but understood the man well
enough to be sure that her mothers hopes would end as they had in the
past She sat down apathetically on the trunk to see what would happen
next

After a brief inspection Holcroft came down from the roof and said
The chimney will have to be repaired which was true enough and
equally so of other parts of the dwelling The fortunes of the owner
were reflected in the appearance of the building

If it were a possible thing Holcroft wished to carry out his ruse
undetected and he hastened upstairs again ostensibly to see that all
danger had passed but in reality to prepare his mind for an intensely
disagreeable interview Id rather face a mob of men than that one
idiotic woman he muttered I could calculate the actions of a
setting hen with her head cut off better than I can this widows But
theres no help for it and he came down looking very resolute Ive
let the fire in my stove go out and theres no more danger he said
quietly as he sat down on the porch opposite Mrs Mumpson

Ohh she exclaimed with a long breath of relief weve saved the
dwelling What would we have done if it had burned down We would
have been homeless

That may be my condition soon as it is he said coldly I am very
glad Mrs Mumpson that you are so much better As Jane told you I
suppose I will pay you the sum I agreed to give you for three months
service

My dear Mr Holcroft my nerves have been too shaken to talk business
this morning and the widow leaned back and looked as if she were
going to faint Im only a poor lone woman she added feebly and
you cannot be so lacking in the milk of human kindness as to take
advantage of me

No madam nor shall I allow you and Lemuel Weeks to take advantage of
me This is my house and I have a right to make my own arrangements

It might all be arranged so easily in another way sighed the widow

It cannot be arranged in any other way he began

Mr Holcroft she cried leaning suddenly forward with clasped hands
and speaking effusively you but now called me your good woman Think
how much those words mean Make them true now that youve spoken
them Then you wont be homeless and will never need a caretaker

Are you making me an offer of marriage he asked with lowering brow

Oh no indeed she simpered That wouldnt be becoming in me Im
only responding to your own words

Rising he said sternly No power on earth could induce me to marry
you and that would be plain enough if you were in your right mind I
shall not stand this foolishness another moment You must go with me
at once to Lemuel Weeks If you will not Ill have you taken to an
insane asylum

To an insane asylum What for she half shrieked springing to her
feet

Youll see he replied going down the steps Jump up Jane I
shall take the trunk to your cousins If you are so crazy as to stay
in a mans house when he dont want you and wont have you you are fit
only for an asylum

Mrs Mumpson was sane enough to perceive that she was at the end of her
adhesive resources In his possession of her trunk the farmer also
had a strategic advantage which made it necessary for her to yield
She did so however with very bad grace When he drove up she
bounced into the wagon as if made of India rubber while Jane followed
slowly with a look of sullen apathy He touched his horses with the
whip into a smart trot scarcely daring to believe in his good fortune
The lane was rather steep and rough and he soon had to pull up lest
the object of his unhappy solicitude should be jolted out of the
vehicle This gave the widow her chance to open fire The end has not
come yet Mr Holcroft she said vindictively You may think you are
going to have an easy triumph over a poor friendless unfortunate
sensitive afflicted woman and a fatherless child but you shall soon
learn that theres a law in the land You have addressed improper
words to me you have threatened me you have broken your agreement I
have writings I have a memory I have language to plead the cause of
the widow and the fatherless I have been wronged outraged trampled
upon and then turned out of doors The indignant world shall hear my
story the finger of scorn will be pointed at you Your name will
become a byword and a hissing Respecterble women respecterbly
connected will stand aloof and shudder

The torrent of words was unchecked except when the wheels struck a
stone jolting her so severely that her jaws came together with a click
as if she were snapping at him

He made no reply whatever but longed to get his hands upon Lemuel
Weeks Pushing his horses to a high rate of speed he soon reached that
interested neighbors door intercepting him just as he was starting to
town

He looked very sour as he saw his wifes relatives and demanded
harshly What does this mean

It means cried Mrs Mumpson in her high cackling tones that hes
said things and done things too awful to speak of that hes broken his
agreement and turned us out of doors

Jim Holcroft said Mr Weeks blustering up to the wagon you cant
carry on with this high hand Take these people back to your house
where they belong or youll be sorry

Holcroft sprang out whirled Mr Weeks out of his way took out the
trunk then with equal expedition and no more ceremony lifted down Mrs
Mumpson and Jane

Do you know what youre about shouted Mr Weeks in a rage Ill
have the law on you this very day

Holcroft maintained his ominous silence as he hitched his horses
securely Then he strode toward Weeks who backed away from him Oh
dont be afraid you sneaking cowardly fox said the farmer bitterly
If I gave you your desserts Id take my horsewhip to you Youre
going to law me are you Well begin today and Ill be ready for you
I wont demean myself by answering that woman but Im ready for you in
any way youve a mind to come Ill put you and your wife on the
witness stand Ill summon Cousin Abram as you call him and his
wife and compel you all under oath to give Mrs Mumpson a few
testimonials Ill prove the trick you played on me and the lies you
told Ill prove that this woman in my absence invaded my room and
with keys of her own opened my dead wifes bureau and pulled out her
things Ill prove that she hasnt earned her salt and cant and may
prove something more Now if you want to go to law begin Nothing
would please me better than to show up you and your tribe Ive
offered to pay this woman her three months wages in full and so have
kept my agreement She has not kept hers for shes only sat in a
rocking chair and made trouble Now do as you please Ill give you
all the law you want Id like to add a horsewhipping but that would
give you a case and now you havent any

As Holcroft uttered these words sternly and slowly like a man angry
indeed but under perfect selfcontrol the perspiration broke out on
Weeks face He was aware that Mrs Mumpson was too well known to play
the role of a wronged woman and remembered what his testimony and that
of many others would be under oath Therefore he began Oh well
Mr Holcroft Theres no need of your getting in such a rage and
threatening so Im willing to talk the matter over and only want to do
the square thing

The farmer made a gesture of disgust as he said I understand you
Lemuel Weeks Theres no talking needed and Im in no mood for it
Heres the money I agreed to pay Ill give it to Mrs Mumpson when
she has signed this paper and youve signed as witness of her
signature Otherwise its law Now decide quick Im in a hurry

Objections were interposed and Holcroft returning the money to his
pocket started for his team without a word Oh well said Weeks in
strong irritation I havent time for a lawsuit at this season of the
year You are both cranks and I suppose it would be best for me and
my folks to be rid of you both Its a pity though you couldnt be
married and left to fight it out

Holcroft took the whip from his wagon and said quietly If you speak
another insulting word Ill horsewhip you and take my chances

Something in the mans look prevented Weeks from uttering another
unnecessary remark The business was soon transacted accompanied
with Mrs Mumpsons venomous words for she had discovered that she
could stigmatize Holcroft with impunity He went to Jane and shook her
hand as he said goodby I am sorry for you and I wont forget my
promise then drove rapidly away

Cousin Lemuel said Mrs Mumpson plaintively wont you have Timothy
take my trunk to our room

No I wont he snapped Youve had your chance and have fooled it
away I was just going to town and you and Jane will go along with
me and he put the widows trunk into his wagon

Mrs Weeks came out and wiped her eyes ostentatiously with her apron as
she whispered I cant help it Cynthy When Lemuel goes off the
handle in this way its no use for me to say anything

Mrs Mumpson wept hysterically as she was driven away Janes sullen
and apathetic aspect had passed away in part for Holcrofts words had
kindled something like hope



Chapter XVII

A Momentous Decision

It must be admitted that Holcroft enjoyed his triumph over Lemuel Weeks
very much after the fashion of the aboriginal man Indeed he was
almost sorry he had not been given a little more provocation knowing
well that had this been true his neighbor would have received a
fuller return for his interested efforts As he saw his farmhouse in
the shimmering April sunlight as the old churning dog came forward
wagging his tail the farmer said This is the only place which can
ever be home to me Well well Its queer about people Some when
they go leave you desolate others make you happy by their absence I
never dreamed that silly Mumpson could make me happy but she has
Blessed if I dont feel happy The first time in a year or more And
he began to whistle old Coronation in the most lively fashion as he
unharnessed his horses

A little later he prepared himself a good dinner and ate it in
leisurely enjoyment sharing a morsel now and then with the old dog
Youre a plaguey sight better company than she was he mused That
poor little stray cat of a Jane What will become of her Well well
Soon as shes old enough to cut loose from her mother Ill try to give
her a chance if its a possible thing

After dinner he made a rough draught of an auction bill offering his
cows for sale muttering as he did so Tom Watterlyll help me put it
in better shape Then he drove a mile away to see old Mr And Mrs
Johnson The former agreed for a small sum to mount guard with his dog
during the farmers occasional absences and the latter readily
consented to do the washing and mending

What do I want of any more peculiar females as that daft widow
called em he chuckled on his return Blames if she wasnt the most
peculiar of the lot Think of me marrying her and the hillside
echoed to his derisive laugh As I feel today theres a better chance
of my being struck by lightning than marrying and I dont think any
woman could do it in spite of me Ill run the ranch alone

That evening he smoked his pipe cheerfully beside the kitchen fire the
dog sleeping at his feet I declare he said smilingly I feel quite
at home

In the morning after attending to his work he went for old Jonathan
Johnson and installed him in charge of the premises then drove to the
almshouse with all the surplus butter and eggs on hand Tom Watterly
arrived at the door with his fasttrotting horse at the same time and
cried Hello Jim Just in time Im a sort of grass widower
todaybeen taking my wife out to see her sister Come in and take pot
luck with me and keep up my spirits

Well now Tom said Holcroft shaking hands Im glad not that
your wifes away although it does make me downhearted to contrast your
lot and mine but Im glad you can give me a little time for I want to
use that practical head of yourssome advice you know

All right Nothing to do for an hour or two but eat dinner and smoke
my pipe with you Here Bill Take this team and feed em

Hold on said Holcroft Im not going to sponge on you Ive got
some favors to ask and I want you to take in return some butter half
spoiled in the making and this basket of eggs Theyre all right

Go to thunder Holcroft What do you take me for When youve filled
your pipe after dinner will you pull an egg out of your pocket and say
Thats for a smoke No no I dont sell any advice to old friends
like you Ill buy your butter and eggs at what theyre worth and have
done with em Business is one thing and sitting down and talking
over an old cronys troubles is another Im not a saint Jim as you
knowa man in politics cant bebut I remember when we were boys
together and somehow thinking of those old days always fetches me
Come in for dinner is awaiting I guess

Well Tom saint or no saint Id like to vote for you for govnor

This aint an electioneering trick as you know I can play them off
as well as the next feller when theres need kiss the babies and all
that

Dinner was placed on the table immediately and in a few moments the
friends were left alone Then Holcroft related in a half comic half
serious manner his tribulations with the help Tom sat back in his
chair and roared at the account of the pitched battle between the two
widows and the final smoking out of Mrs Mumpson but he reproached his
friend for not having horsewhipped Lemuel Weeks Dont you remember
Jim he was a sneaking tricky chap when we were at school together I
licked him once and it always does me good to think of it

I own it takes considerable to rile me to the point of striking a man
especially on his own land His wife was looking out the window too
If wed been out in the road or anywhere elsebut whats the use Im
glad now it turned out as it has for Ive too much on my mind for
lawsuits and the less one has to do with such cattle as Weeks the
better Well you see Im alone again and Im going to go it alone
Im going to sell my cows and give up the dairy and the thing I wanted
help in most is the putting this auction bill in shape also advice as
to whether I had better try to sell here in town or up at the farm

Tom shook his head dubiously and scarcely glanced at the paper Your
scheme dont look practical to me he said I dont believe you can
run that farm alone without losing money Youll just keep on going
behind till the first thing you know youll clap a mortgage on it
Then youll soon be done for Whats more youll break down if you try
to do both outdoor and indoor work Busy times will soon come and you
wont get your meals regularly youll be living on coffee and anything
that comes handiest your house will grow untidy and not fit to live
in If you should be taken sick thered be no one to do for you
Lumbermen hunters and such fellows can rough it alone awhile but I
never heard of a farm being run by manpower alone Now as to selling
out your stock look at it Grazing is what your farms good for
mostly Its a pity youre so bent on staying there Even if you
didnt get very much for the place from sale or rent youd have
something that was sure A strong capable man like you could find
something to turn your hand to Then you could board in some
respectable family and not have to live like Robinson Crusoe Ive
thought it over since we talked last and if I was you Id sell or
rent

Its too late in the season to do either said Holcroft dejectedly
Whats more I dont want to at least not this year Ive settled
that Tom Im going to have one more summer on the old place anyway
if I have to live on bread and milk

You cant make bread

Ill have it brought from town on the stage

Well its a pity some good decent womanThere how should I come to
forget all about HER till this minute I dont know whether it would
work Perhaps it would Theres a woman here out of the common run
She has quite a story which Ill tell you in confidence Then you can
say whether youd like to employ her or not If you WILL stay on the
farm my advice is that you have a woman to do the housework and me
and Angy must try to find you one if the one I have in mind wont
answer The trouble is Holcroft to get the right kind of a woman to
live there alone with you unless you married her Nice women dont
like to be talked about and I dont blame em The one thats here
though is so friendless and alone in the world that she might be glad
enough to get a home almost anywheres

Well well Tell me about her said Holcroft gloomily But Im about
discouraged in the line of women help

Watterly told Alidas story with a certain rude pathos which touched
the farmers naturally kind heart and he quite forgot his own need in
indignation at the poor womans wrongs Its a  shame he said
excitedly pacing the room I say Tom all the law in the land
wouldnt keep me from giving that fellow a whipping or worse

Well she wont prosecute she wont face the public she just wants
to go to some quiet place and work for her bread She dont seem to
have any friends or else shes too ashamed to let them know

Why of course Id give such a woman a refuge till she could do
better What man wouldnt

A good many wouldnt Whats more if she went with you her story
might get out and youd both be talked about

I dont care that for gossip with a snap of his fingers You know
Id treat her with respect

What I know and what other people would say are two very different
things Neither you nor anyone else can go too strongly against public
opinion Still its nobodys business added Tom thoughtfully
Perhaps its worth the trial If she went I think shed stay and do
the best by you she could Would you like to see her

Yes

Alida was summoned and stood with downcast eyes in the door Come in
and take a chair said Tom kindly You know I promised to be on the
lookout for a good place for you Well my friend here Mr Holcroft
whom Ive known ever since I was a boy wants a woman to do general
housework and take care of the dairy

She gave the farmer one of those swift comprehensive glances by which
women take in a personality and said in a tone of regret But I dont
understand dairy work

Oh youd soon learn Its just the kind of a place you said you
wanted a lonely outoftheway farm and no other help kept Whats
more my friend Holcroft is a kind honest man Hed treat you right
He knows all about your trouble and is sorry for you

If Holcroft had been an ogre in appearance he would have received the
grateful glance which she now gave him as she said Id be only too
glad to work for you sir if you think I can do or learn to do what
is required

Holcroft while his friend was speaking had studied closely Alidas
thin pale face and he saw nothing in it not in harmony with the story
he had heard I am sorry for you he said kindly I believe you
never meant to do wrong and have tried to do right I will be
perfectly honest with you My wife is dead the help I had has left
me and I live alone in the house The truth is too that I could not
afford to keep two in help and there would not be work for them both

Alida had learned much in her terrible adversity and had moreover the
instincts of a class superior to the position she was asked to take
She bowed low to hide the burning flush that crimsoned her pale cheeks
as she faltered It may seem strange to you sirs that one situated
as I am should hesitate but I have never knowingly done anything which
gave people the right to speak against me I do not fear work I would
humbly try to do my best but She hesitated and rose as if to retire

I understand you said Holcroft kindly and I dont blame you for
doing what you think is right

Im very sorry sir she replied tears coming into her eyes as she
went out of the room

There it is Holcroft said Tom I believe shes just the one for
you but you can see she isnt of the common kind She knows as well
as you and me how people would talk especially if her story came out
as like enough it will

Hang people snarled the farmer

Yes a good lot of em deserve hanging but it wouldnt help you any
just now Perhaps shed go with you if you got another girl or took an
old woman from the house here to keep her company

Im sick to death of such hags said the farmer with an impatient
gesture Then he sat down and looked at his friend as if a plan was
forming in his mind of which he scarcely dare speak

Well out with it said Tom

Have you ever seen a marriage ceremony performed by a justice of the
peace Holcroft asked slowly

No but they do it often enough What Are you going to offer her
marriage

You say she is homeless and friendless

Yes

And you believe she is just what she seemsjust what her story shows
her to be

Yes Ive seen too many frauds to be taken in She isnt a fraud
Neither does she belong to that miserable wishywashy downhill class
that sooner or later fetches up in a poorhouse They say were all
made of dust but some seem made of mud You could see she was out of
the common and shes here on account of the wrong she received and not
the wrong she did I say all this in fairness to her but when it
comes to marrying her thats another question

Tom as Ive told you I dont want to marry In fact I couldnt go
before a minister and promise what Id have to But I could do
something like this I could give this woman an honest name and a home
It would be marriage before the law No one could ever say a word
against either of us I would be true and kind to her and she should
share in my fortunes Thats all You have often advised me to marry
and you know if I did it couldnt be anything else but a business
affair Then it ought to be done in a businesslike way You say I
cant get along alone and like enough youre right Ive learned more
from this womans manner than I have in a year why I cant get and keep
the right kind of help and I now feel if I could find a good honest
woman who would make my interest hers and help me make a living in my
own home Id give her my name and all the security which an honest
name conveys Now this poor woman is in sore need and she might be
grateful for what I can do while any other woman would naturally
expect me to promise more than I honestly can Anyhow Id have to go
through the form and I cant and wont go and say sacred wordsjust
about what I said when I married my wifeand know all the time I was
lying

Well Holcroft youre a queer dick and this is a queer plan of yours
Youre beyond my depth now and I cant advise

Why is it a queer plan Things only seem odd because they are not
common As a matter of fact you advise a business marriage When I
try to follow your advice honestly and not dishonestly you say Im
queer

I suppose if everybody became honest it would be the queerest world
every known said Tom laughing Well you might do worse than marry
this woman I can tell you that marrying is risky business at best
You know a justice will tie you just as tight as a minister and while
Ive given you my impression about this woman I KNOW little about her
and you know next to nothing

I guess that would be the case anyhow If you set out to find a wife
for me where is there a woman that you actually do know more about
As for my going here and there to get acquainted its out of the
question All my feelings rise up against such a course Now I feel
sorry for this woman She has at least my sympathy If she is as
friendless poor and unhappy as she seems I might do her as great a
kindness as she would do for me if she could take care of my home I
wouldnt expect very much It would be a comfort just to have someone
in the house that wouldnt rob or waste and who knowing what her
station was would be content Of course Id have to talk it over with
her and make my purpose clear She might agree with you that its too
queer to be thought of If so that would be the end of it

Will Jim you always finish by half talking me over to your side of a
question Now if my wife was home I dont believe shed listen to
any such plan

No I suppose she wouldnt Shed believe in people marrying and
doing everything in the ordinary way But neither I nor this woman is
in ordinary circumstances Do you know of a justice

Yes and you know him too Justice Harkins

Why certainly He came from our town and I knew him when he was a
boy although I havent seen much of him of late years

Well shall I go and say to this womanAlida Armstrong is her name
now I supposethat you wish to see her again

Yes I shall tell her the truth Then she can decide



Chapter XVIII

Holcroft Gives His Hand

Alida was seated by a window with some of the mending in which she
assisted and as usual was apart by herself Watterly entered the
large apartment quietly and at first she did not observe him He had
time to note that she was greatly dejected and when she saw him she
hastily wiped tears from her eyes

You are a good deal cast down Alida he said watching her closely

Ive reason to be I dont see any light ahead at all

Well you know the old saying Its darkest before day I want you
to come with me again I think Ive found a chance for you

She rose with alacrity and followed As soon as they were alone he
turned and looked her squarely in the face as he said gravely You
have good common sense havent you

I dont know sir she faltered perplexed and troubled by the
question

Well you can understand this much I suppose As superintendent of
this house I have a responsible position which I could easily lose if
I allowed myself to be mixed up with anything wrong or improper To
come right to the point you dont know much about me and next to
nothing of my friend Holcroft but cant you see that even if I was a
heartless goodfornothing fellow it wouldnt be wise or safe for me
to permit anything that wouldnt bear the light

I think you are an honest man sir It would be strange if I did not
have confidence when you have judged me and treated me so kindly But
Mr Watterly although helpless and friendless I must try to do what I
think is best If I accepted Mr Holcrofts position it might do him
harm You know how quick the world is to misjudge It would seem to
confirm everything that has been said against me and the same painful
flush again overspread her features

Well Alida all that you have to do is to listen patiently to my
friend Whether you agree with his views or not you will see that he
is a goodhearted honest man I want to prepare you for this talk by
assuring you that Ive known him since he was a boy that he has lived
all his life in this region and is known by many others and that I
wouldnt dare let him ask you to do anything wrong even if I was bad
enough

Im sure sir you dont wish me any harm she again faltered in deep
perplexity

Indeed I dont I dont advise my friends course neither do I
oppose it Hes certainly old enough to act for himself I suppose Im
a rough counselor for a young woman but since you appear to have so
few friends Im inclined to act as one Just you stand on the question
of right and wrong and dismiss from your mind all foolish notions of
what people will say As a rule all the people in the world cant do
as much for us as somebody in particular Now you go in the parlor and
listen like a sensible woman Ill be reading the paper and the girl
will be clearing off the table in the next room here

Puzzled and trembling Alida entered the apartment where Holcroft was
seated She was so embarrassed that she could not lift her eyes to him

Please sit down he said gravely and dont be troubled much less
frightened You are just as free to act as ever you were in your life

She sat down near the door and compelled herself to look at him for
she felt instinctively that she might gather more from the expression
of his face than from his words

Alida Armstrong is your name Mr Watterly tells me

Yes sir

Well Alida I want to have a plain business talk with you Thats
nothing to be nervous and worried about you know As I told you Ive
heard your story It has made me sorry for you instead of setting me
against you It has made me respect you as a rightminded woman and I
shall give you good proof that my words are true At the same time I
shant make any false pretenses to what isnt true and couldnt be
true Since Ive heard your story its only fair you should hear
mine and I ought to tell it first

He went over the past very briefly until he came to the death of his
wife There was simple and homely pathos in the few sentences with
which he referred to this event Then more fully he enlarged upon his
efforts and failure to keep house with hired help Unconsciously he
had taken the best method to enlist her sympathy The secluded cottage
and hillside farm became realities to her fancy She saw how the mans
heart clung to his home and his effort to keep it touched her deeply

Oh she thought I do wish there was some way for me to go there
The loneliness of the place which drove others away is the chief
attraction for me Then it would be pleasant to work for such a man
and make his home comfortable for him Its plain from his words and
looks that hes as honest and straightforward as the day is long He
only wants to keep his home and make his living in peace

As he had talked her nervous embarrassment passed away and the deep
sense of her own need was pressing upon her again She saw that he
also was in great need His business talk was revealing deep trouble
and perplexity With the quick intuitions of a woman her mind went
far beyond his brief sentences and saw all the difficulties of his lot
His feeling reference to the loss of his wife proved that he was not a
coarsenatured man As he spoke so plainly of his life during the past
year her mind was insensibly abstracted from everything but his want
and hers and she thought his farmhouse afforded just the secluded
refuge she craved As he drew near the end of his story and hesitated
in visible embarrassment she mustered courage to say timidly Would
you permit a suggestion from me

Why certainly

You have said sir that your business and means would not allow you
to keep two in help and as you have been speaking I have tried to
think of some way The fact that your house is so lonely is just the
reason why I should like to work in it As you can understand I have
no wish to meet strangers Now sir I am willing to work for very
little I should be glad to find such a quiet refuge for simply my
board and clothes and I would do my very best and try to learn what I
did not know It seems to me that if I worked for so little you might
think you could afford to hire some elderly woman also and she looked
at him in the eager hope that he would accept her proposition

He shook his head as he replied I dont know of any such person I
took the best one in this house and you know how she turned out

Perhaps Mr Watterly may know of someone else she faltered She was
now deeply troubled and perplexed again supposing that he was about to
renew his first proposition that she should be his only help

If Mr Watterly did know of anyone I would make the trial but he does
not Your offer is very considerate and reasonable but and he
hesitated again scarcely knowing how to go on

I am sorry sir she said rising as if to end the interview

Stay he said you do not understand me yet Of course I should not
make you the same offer that I did at first after seeing your feeling
about it and I respect you all the more because you so respect
yourself What I had in mind was to give you my name and its an
honest name If we were married it would be perfectly proper for you
to go with me and no one could say a word against either of us

Oh she gasped in strong agitation and surprise

Now dont be so taken aback Its just as easy for you to refuse as
it is to speak but listen first What seems strange and unexpected
may be the most sensible thing for us both You have your side of the
case to think of just as truly as I have mine and Im not forgetting
and I dont ask you to forget that Im still talking business You
and I have both been through too much trouble and loss to say any silly
nonsense to each other Youve heard my story yet Im almost a
stranger to you as you are to me Wed both have to take considerable
on trust Yet I know Im honest and wellmeaning and I believe you
are Now look at it Here we are both much alone in the worldboth
wishing to live a retired quiet life I dont care a rap for what
people say as long as Im doing right and in this case theyd have
nothing to say Its our own business I dont see as people will
ever do much for you and a good many would impose on you and expect
you to work beyond your strength They might not be very kind or
considerate either I suppose youve thought of this

Yes she replied with bowed head I should meet coldness probably
harshness and scorn

Well youd never meet anything of the kind in my house I would
treat you with respect and kindness At the same time Im not going
to mislead you by a word You shall have a chance to decide in view of
the whole truth My friend Mr Watterly has asked me moren once
Why dont you marry again I told him I had been married once and
that I couldnt go before a minister and promise the same things over
again when they wasnt true I cant make to you any promises or say
any words that are not true and I dont ask or expect you to do what I
cant do But it has seemed to me that our condition was out of the
common lotthat we could take each other for just what we might be to
each other and no more You would be my wife in name and I do not ask
you to be my wife in more than name You would thus secure a good home
and the care and protection of one who would be kind to you and I
would secure a housekeeperone that would stay with me and make my
interests hers It would be a fair square arrangement between
ourselves and nobody elses business By taking this course we dont
do any wrong to our feelings or have to say or promise anything that
isnt true

Yet I cant help saying sir she replied in strong yet repressed
agitation that your words sound very strange and it seems stranger
still that you can offer marriage of any kind to a woman situated as I
am You know my story sir she added crimsoning and all may soon
know it You would suffer wrong and injury

I offer you open and honorable marriage before the world and no other
kind Mr Watterly and othersas many as you pleasedwould witness
it and Id have you given a certificate at once As for your story
it has only awakened my sympathy You have not meant to do any wrong
Your troubles are only another reason in my mind for not taking any
advantage of you or deceiving you in the least Look the truth
squarely in the face Im bent on keeping my house and getting my
living as I have done and I need a housekeeper that will be true to
all my interests Think how Ive been robbed and wronged and what a
dogs life Ive lived in my own home You need a home a support and
a protector I couldnt come to you or go to any other woman and say
honestly more than this Isnt it better for people to be united on
the ground of truth than to begin by telling a pack of lies

Butbut can people be married with such an understanding by a
minister Wouldnt it be deceiving him

I shall not ask you to deceive anyone Any marriage that either you
or I could now make would be practically a business marriage I should
therefore take you if you were willing to a justice and have a legal
or civil marriage performed and this would be just as binding as any
other in the eye of the law It is often done This would be much
better to my mind than if people situated as we are went to a church
or a minister

Yes yes I couldnt do that

Well now Alida he said with a smile that wonderfully softened his
rugged features you are free to decide It may seem to you a strange
sort of courtship but we are both too old for much foolishness I
never was sentimental and it would be ridiculous to begin now Im
full of trouble and perplexity and so are you Are you willing to be
my wife so far as an honest name goes and help me make a living for us
both Thats all I ask I in my turn would promise to treat you
with kindness and respect and give you a home as long as I lived and
to leave you all I have in the world if I died Thats all I could
promise Im a lonely quiet man and like to be by myself I
wouldnt be much society for you Ive said more today than I might in
a month for I felt that it was due to you to know just what you were
doing

Oh sir said Alida trembling and with tears in her eyes you do
not ask much and you offer a great deal If you a strong man dread
to leave your home and go out into the world you know not where think
how terrible it is for a weak friendless woman to be worse than
homeless I have lost everything even my good name

No no Not in my eyes

Oh I know I know she cried wringing her hands Even these
miserable paupers like myself have made me feel it They have burned
the truth into my brain and heart Indeed sir you do not realize
what you are doing or asking It is not fit or meet that I should bear
your name You might be sorry indeed

Alida said Holcroft gravely Ive not forgotten your story and you
shouldnt forget mine Be sensible now Dont I look old enough to
know what Im about

Oh oh oh she cried impetuously if I were only sure it was right
It may be business to you but it seems like life or death to me Its
more than deathI dont fear thatbut I do fear life I do fear the
desperate struggle just to maintain a bare dreary existence I do
dread going out among strangers and seeing their cold curiosity and
their scorn You cant understand a womans heart It isnt right for
me to die till God takes me but life has seemed so horrible meeting
suspicion on one side and cruel significant looks of knowledge on the
other Ive been tortured even here by these wretched hags and Ive
envied even them so near to death yet not ashamed like me I know
and you should know that my heart is broken crushed trampled into
the mire I had felt that for me even the thought of marriage again
would be a mockery a wicked thing which I would never have a right to
entertainI never dreamt that anyone would think of such a thing
knowing what you know Oh oh Why have you tempted me so if it is
not right I must do right The feeling that Ive not meant to do
wrong is all that has kept me from despair But can it be right to let
you take me from the street the poorhouse with nothing to give but a
blighted name a broken heart and feeble hands See I am but the
shadow of what I was and a dark shadow at that I could be only a
dismal shadow at any mans hearth Oh oh Ive thought and suffered
until my reason seemed going You dont realize you dont know the
depths into which Ive fallen It cant be right

Holcroft was almost appalled at this passionate outburst in one who
thus far had been sad indeed yet selfcontrolled He looked at her
in mingled pity and consternation His own troubles had seemed heavy
enough but he now caught glimpses of something far beyond troubleof
agony of mortal dread that bordered on despair He could scarcely
comprehend how terrible to a woman like Alida were the recent events of
her life and how circumstances with illness had all tended to create
a morbid horror of her situation Like himself she was naturally
reticent in regard to her deeper feelings patient and undemonstrative
Had not his words evoked this outburst she might have suffered and died
in silence but in this final conflict between conscience and hope the
hot lava of her heart had broken forth So little was he then able to
understand her that suspicions crossed his mind Perhaps his friend
Watterly had not heard the true story or else not the whole story But
his straightforward simplicity stood him in good stead and he said
gently Alida you say I dont know I dont realize I believe you
will tell me the truth You went to a minister and were married to a
man that you thought you had a right to marry

You shall know it all from my own lips she said interrupting him
you have a right to know and then you will see that it cannot be
and with bowed head and low rapid passionate utterance she poured
out her story That woman his wife she concluded made me feel
that I was of the scum and offscouring of the earth and theyve made
me feel so here tooeven these wretched paupers So the world will
look on me till God takes me to my mother O thank God She dont
know Don you see now she asked raising her despairing eyes from
which agony had dried all tears

Yes I see you do she added desperately for even you have turned
from me

Confound it cried Holcroft standing up and searching his pockets
for a handkerchief IIId likelike to choke that fellow If I
could get my hands on him thered be trouble Turn away from you you
poor wronged creature Dont you see Im so sorry for you that Im
making a fool of myself I who couldnt shed a tear over my own
troublesthere therecome now let us be sensible Lets get back
to business for I cant stand this kind of thing at all Im so
confused betwixt rage at him and pity for youLet me see this is
where we were I want someone to take care of my home and you want a
home Thats all there is about it now If you say so Ill make you
Mrs Holcroft in an hour

I did not mean to work upon your sympathies only to tell you the
truth God bless you That the impulses of your heart are so kind and
merciful But let me be true to you as well as to myself Go away and
think it all over calmly and quietly Even for the sake of being
rescued from a life that I dread far more than death I cannot let you
do that which you may regret unspeakably Do not think I misunderstand
your offer Its the only one I could think of and I would not have
thought of it if you had not spoke I have no heart to give I could
be a wife only in name but I could work like a slave for protection
from a cruel jeering world I could hope for something like peace and
respite from suffering if I only had a safe refuge But I must not
have these if it is not right and best Good to me must not come
through wrong to you

Tush tush You mustnt talk so I cant stand it at all Ive
heard your story Its just as I supposed at first only a great deal
more so Why of course its all right It makes me believe in
Providence it all turns out so entirely for our mutual good I can do
as much to help you as you to help me Now lets get back on the
sensible solid ground from which we started The idea of my wanting
you to work like a slave Like enough some people would and then
youd soon break down and be brought back here again No no Ive
explained just what I wish and just what I mean You must get over the
notion that Im a sentimental fool carried away by my feelings How
Tom Watterly would laugh at the idea My mind is made up now just as
much as it would be a week hence This is no place for you and I
dont like to think of your being here My spring work is pressing
too Dont you see that by doing what I ask you can set me right on my
feet and start me uphill again after a year of miserable downhill work
You have only to agree to what Ive said and you will be at home
tonight and Ill be quietly at my work tomorrow Mr Watterly will go
with us to the justice who has known me all my life Then if anyone
ever says a word against you hell have me to settle with Come
Alida Heres a strong hand thats able to take care of you

She hesitated a moment then clasped it like one who is sinking and
before he divined her purpose she kissed and bedewed it with tears



Chapter XIX

A Business Marriage

While Holcrofts sympathies had been deeply touched by the intense
emotion of gratitude which had overpowered Alida he had also been
disturbed and rendered somewhat anxious He was actually troubled lest
the woman he was about to marry should speedily begin to love him and
develop a tendency to manifest her affection in a manner that would
seem to him extravagant and certainly disagreeable Accustomed all his
life to repress his feelings he wondered at himself and could not
understand how he had given way so unexpectedly He was not
sufficiently versed in human nature to know that the depth of Alidas
distress was the adequate cause If there had been a false or an
affected word he would have remained cool enough In his inability to
gauge his own nature as well as hers he feared lest this businesslike
marriage was verging toward sentiment on her part He did not like her
kissing his hand He was profoundly sorry for her but so he would
have been for any other woman suffering under the burden of a great
wrong He felt that it would be embarrassing if she entertained
sentiments toward him which he could not reciprocate and open
manifestations of regard would remind him of that horror of his life
Mrs Mumpson He was not incapable of quick strong sympathy in any
instance of genuine trouble but he was one of those men who would
shrink in natural recoil from any marked evidence of a womans
preference unless the counterpart of her regard existed in his own
breast

To a woman of Alidas intuition the way in which he withdrew his hand
and the expression of his face had a world of meaning She would not
need a second hint Yet she did not misjudge him she knew that he
meant what he had said and had said all that he meant She was also
aware that he had not and never could understand the depths of fear and
suffering from which his hand was lifting her Her gratitude was akin
to that of a lost soul saved and that was all she had involuntarily
expressed She sat down again and quietly dried her eyes while in her
heart she purposed to show her gratitude by patient assiduity in
learning to do what he required

Holcroft was now bent upon carrying out his plan as quickly as possible
and returning home He therefore asked Can you go with me at once
Alida

She simply bowed her acquiescence

Thats sensible Perhaps you had better get your things ready while I
and Mr Watterly go and arrange with Justice Harkins

Alida averted her face with a sort of shame which a woman feels who
admits such a truth I havent anything sir but a hat and cloak to
put on I came away and left everything

And Im glad of it said Holcroft heartily I wouldnt want you to
bring anything which that scoundrel gave you He paced the room
thoughtfully a moment or two and then he called Watterly in Its
settled Tom Alida will be Mrs Holcroft as soon as we can see the
justice Do you think we could persuade him to come here

One thing at a time Mrs HolcroftI may as well call you so for
when my friend says hell do a thing he does itI congratulate you
I think you are well out of your troubles Since you are to marry my
old friend we must be friends too and he shook her heartily by the
hand

His words and manner were another ray of lighta welcome rift in the
black pall that had gathered round her

You were the first friend I found sir afterwhat happened she
said gratefully

Well youve found another and a better one and hell always be just
the same Any woman might be glad

Come Tom no more of that Im a plain old farmer that does what he
agrees and thats all there is about it Ive told Alida just what I
wished and could do

I should hope so interrupted Watterly laughing Youve taken time
enough certainly and I guess youve talked more than you have before
in a year

Yes I know Im almost as bad as an oyster about talking except when
Im with you Somehow weve always had a good deal to say to each
other In this case I felt that it was due to Alida that she should
know all about me and understand fully just how I felt concerning this
marriage The very fact that she hasnt friends to advise her made it
all the more needful that I should be plain and not mislead her in any
respectShe has just as good a right to judge and act for herself as
any woman in the land and she takes me and I take her with no
sentimental lies to start with Now lets get back to business I
rather think since Harkins was an old acquaintance of mine hell come
up here and marry us dont you Alida wouldnt you rather be married
here quietly than face a lot of strangers You can have your own way
I dont care now if half the town was present

Oh yes indeed sir I dont want to meet strangersandandIm
not very strong yet I thank you for considering my feelings so
kindly

Why thats my duty replied the farmer Come Watterly the sun is
getting low and weve considerable to do yet before we start home

Im with you Now Alida you go back quietly and act as if nothing
had happened till I send for you Of course this impatient young groom
will hurry back with the justice as fast as possible Still we may
not find him or he may be so busy that we shall have to come back for
you and take you to his office

As she turned to leave the room Holcroft gave her his hand and said
kindly Now dont you be nervous or worried I see you are not
strong and you shall not be taxed any more than I can help Goodby
for a little while

Meantime Watterly stepped out a moment and gave his domestic a few
orders then he accompanied Holcroft to the barn and the horses were
soon attached to the market wagon Youre in for it now Jim sure
enough he said laughing What will Angy say to it all

Tell her that I say youve been a mighty good friend to me yet I hope
I may never return any favors of the same kind

By jocks I hope not I guess its just as well she was away
Shell think weve acted just like two harumscarum men and will be
awfully scandalized over your marrying this woman Dont you feel a
little nervous about it

No When my minds made up I dont worry Nobody else need lie
awake for its my affair

Well Jim you know how I feel about it but Ive got to say something
and I might as well say it plain

Thats the only way you ought to say it

Well you talked long enough to give me plenty of time to think One
thing is clear Angy wont take to this marriage You know Id like to
have you both come in and take a meal as you always have done but then
a man must keep peace with his wife and

I understand Tom We wont come till Mrs Watterly asks us

But you wont have hard feelings

No indeed Aint you doing your level best as a friend

Well you know women are so set about these things and Angy is rather
hard on people who dont come up to her mark of respectability Whats
more I suppose youll find that others will think and act as she does
If you cared about peoples opinions I should have been dead against
it but as you feel and are situated Im hanged if I dont think shes
just the one

If it hadnt been this one I dont believe it would have been anyone
Here we are and he tied his horses before the office of the justice

Mr Harkins greeted Holcroft with a sort of patronizing cordiality and
was good enough to remember that they had been at the little country
schoolhouse together In Watterly he heartily recognized a brother
politician who controlled a goodly number of votes

When Holcroft briefly made known his errand the justice gave a great
guffaw of laughter and said Oh bring her here And Ill invite in
some of the boys as witnesses

Im not afraid of all the witnesses that you could crowd into a
tenacre lot said Holcroft somewhat sternly but there is no
occasion to invite the boys whoever they are or anyone else She
doesnt want to be stared at I was in hopes Mr Harkins that youd
ride up to the almshouse with us and quietly marry us there

Well I guess youd better bring her here Im pretty busy this
afternoon and

See here Ben said Watterly taking the justice aside Holcroft is
my friend and you know Im mighty thick with my friends They count
more with me than my wifes relations Now I want you to do what
Holcroft wishes as a personal favor to me and the time will come when
I can make it up to you

Oh certainly Watterly I didnt understand replied Harkins who
looked upon Holcroft as a close and as he would phrase it noaccount
farmer from whom he could never expect even a vote Ill go with you
at once Its but a short job

Well said Holcroft how short can you make it

Let me get my book and he took from a shelf the Justices
Assistant You cant want anything shorter than this and he read
By this act of joining hands you do take each other as husband and
wife and solemnly engage in the presence of these witnesses to love and
honor and comfort and cherish each other as such so long as you both
shall live Therefore in accordance with the law of the state of New
York I do hereby pronounce you husband and wife A sailor couldnt
tie a knot quicker than that

I guess you can justice said Holcroft taking the book Suppose
you only read this much By this act of joining hands you do take each
other as husband and wife Therefore in accordance with the law
etc Would that be a legal marriage

Certainly Youd have to go to a divorce court to get out of that

Its my purpose to keep out of courts of all kinds Ill thank you to
read just that much and no more I dont want to say anything that
isnt exactly true

You see how it is Ben Holcroft hasnt known the woman long and
shes a nice woman too if she is boarding at my hotel Holcroft
needs a wifemust have one in fact to help run his house and dairy
It wasnt exactly a love match you know and hes that kind of a man
that a yoke of oxen couldnt draw a word out of him that he didnt
mean

Yes yes I see now said Harkins Ill read just what you say and
no more

And Ill have a little spread that we can be longer at than the
ceremony added Watterly who was inclined to be a little hilarious
over the affair

Holcroft however maintained his grave manner and when they reached
the almshouse he took Watterly aside and said See here Tom youve
been a good friend today and seconded me in everything Now let the
affair pass off just as quietly and seriously as possible Shes too
cast down for a gay wedding Suppose we had a daughter whod been
through such an experiencea nice good modest girl Her hearts too
sore for fun and jokes My marrying her is much the same as pulling
her out of deep water in which she was sinking

Youre right Jim I didnt think and one doesnt have much cause to
be so sparing of the feelings of such creatures as come here But
shes out of the common run and I ought to have remembered it By
jocks Youre mighty careful about promising to love cherish and
obey and all that but I guess youll do a sight more than many who do
promise

Of course Im going to be kind Thats my duty Give Harkins a hint
Tell him that shes lost her mother He neednt know when the old lady
died but it will kind of solemnize him

Watterly did as requested and Harkins now convinced that his
political interests could be furthered by careful compliance with all
requirements put on a grave official air and was ready for business

Alida was sent for She was too agitated to say farewell to any of the
poor creatures with whom she had been compelled to associateeven to
the few who though scarcely sane had manifested tenderness and
affection She had felt that she must reserve all her strength for the
coming ordeal which she both welcomed and feared inexpressibly She
knew how critical was the step she was taking and how much depended on
it yet the more she thought the more it seemed to her as if
Providence had as by a miracle given her a refuge Holcrofts
businesslike view of the marriage comforted her greatly and she asked
God to give her health and strength to work faithfully for him many
years

But she had sad misgivings as she followed the messenger for she felt
so weak that she could scarcely walk It was indeed a pallid
sorrowful trembling bride that entered Mr Watterlys parlor
Holcroft met her and taking her hand said kindly Courage It will
be over in a minute

She was so pale and agitated that the justice asked do you enter into
this marriage freely and without compulsion of any kind

Please let me sit down a moment she faltered and Watterly hastened
to give her a chair She fixed her eyes on Holcroft and said
anxiously You see sir how weak I am I have been sick andand I
fear I am far from being well now I fear you will be
disappointedthat it is not right to you and that I may not be able

Alida interrupted Holcroft gravely Im not one to break my word
Home and quiet will soon restore you Answer the justice and tell him
the exact truth

No elixir could have brought hope and courage like that word home
She rose at once and said to Harkins I have consented to Mr
Holcrofts wishes with feelings of the deepest gratitude

Very well Join hands

She hesitated and looked for a moment at Holcroft with strange
intensity

Its all right Alida he said with a smile Come

His perfect honesty and steadfastness of purpose stood him in good
stead then for she came at once to his side and took his hand

Justice Harkins solemnly opened his big book and read By this act of
joining hands you do take each other as husband and wife Therefore
in accordance with the law of the State of New York I do hereby
pronounce you husband and wife Thats all

I dont think youll ever be sorry Alida said Holcroft pressing
her hand as he led her to a chair Watterly again bustled up with
congratulations and then said you must all come out now to a little
supper and also remember that it was gotten up in a hurry

The domestic stared at Alida and Holcroft and then surmising what had
taken place was so excited that she could scarcely wait on the guests

Holcroft with the simple tact which genuine kindness usually suggests
was attentive to his bride but managed by no slight effort for him
to engage the two men in general conversation so that Alida might have
time to recover her composure His quiet matteroffact bearing was
reassuring in itself A cup of strong tea and a little old currant
wine which Watterly insisted on her taking brightened her up not a
little Indeed her weakness was now largely due to the want of
nourishment suited to her feeble condition Moreover both nerves and
mind found relief and rest in the consciousness that the decisive step
had been taken She was no longer shuddering and recoiling from a past
in which each day had revealed more disheartening elements Her face
was now toward a future that promised a refuge security and even hope

The quiet meal was soon over Holcroft put a fivedollar bill in the
hands of the justice who filled in a certificate and departed feeling
that the afternoon had not been spent in vain

Jim said Watterly drawing his friend aside youll want to make
some purchases You know shes only what she wears How are you off
for money

Well Tom you know I didnt expect anything of this kind when

Of course I know it Will fifty answer

Yes Youre a good friend Ill return it in a day or two

Return it when youre a mind to I say Alida I want you to take
this Jim Holcroft cant get married and his bride not receive a
present from me and he put ten dollars in her hand

Tears rushed to her eyes as she turned them inquiringly to Holcroft to
know what she should do

Now see here Tom youve done too much for us already

Shut up Jim Holcroft Dont you end the day by hurting my feelings
Its perfectly right and proper for me to do this Goodby Alida I
dont believe youll ever be sorry you found your way to my hotel

Alida took his proffered hand but could only falter II can never
forget



Chapter XX

Uncle Jonathans Impression of the Bride

Now Alida said Holcroft as they drove away remember that we are
two middleaged sensible people At least Im middleaged and fairly
sensible too I hope Youll need to buy some things and I want you
to get all you need Dont stint yourself and you neednt hurry so as
to get tired for we shall have moonlight and theres no use trying to
get home before dark Is there any particular store which youd like to
go to

No sir only Id rather go over on the east side of the town where
Im not known

That suits me for its the side nearest home and I AM known there

Perhapsperhaps you also would rather go this evening where you are
not known she said hesitatingly

It makes no difference to me In fact I know of a place where youll
have a good choice at reasonable rates

Ill go where you wish she said quietly

They soon entered a large shop together and the proprietor said
pleasantly Good evening Mr Holcroft

Good evening Mr Jasper My wife wants to get some things If
youll be good enough to wait on her Ill step out to do two or three
errands

The merchant looked curiously at Alida but was too polite to ask
questions or make comments on her very simple purchases Her old skill
and training were of service now She knew just what she absolutely
needed and bought no more

Holcroft laid in a good stock of groceries and some juicy beef and then
returned When Mr Jasper gave him his bill he went to Alida who was
resting and said in a low voice This wont do at all You cant
have bought half enough

For the first time something like a smile flitted across her face as
she replied Its enough to begin with I know

Really Mr Holcroft I didnt know you were married said the
merchant I must congratulate you

Well I am Thank you Good night

A few moments later he and his wife were bowling out of town toward the
hills Reaching one of these the horses came down to a walk and
Holcroft turned and said Are you very tired Alida Im troubled
about you taking this long ride You have been so sick

Im sorry Im not stronger sir but the fresh air seems to do me good
and I think I can stand it

You didnt promise to obey me did you with a rather nervous little
laugh

No sir but I will

Thats a good beginning Now see what an old tyrant I am In the
first place I dont want you to say sir to me any more My name is
James In the second place you must work only as I let you Your
first business is to get strong and well and you know we agreed to
marry on strictly business grounds

I understand it well but I think you are very kind for a business
man

Oh as to that if I do say it of myself I dont think its my nature
to be hard on those who treat me square I think we shall be very good
friends in our quiet way and thats more than can be said of a good
many who promise more than they seem to remember afterward

I will try to do all you wish for I am very grateful

If you do you may find Im as grateful as you are

That can never be Your need and mine were very differentBut I
shall try to show my gratitude by learning your ways and wishes and not
by many words of thanks

Thank the Lord mentally ejaculated the farmer theres no Mrs
Mumpson in this case but he only said kindly I think we understand
each other now Alida Im not a man of words either and I had better
show by actions also what I am The fact is although we are married
we are scarcely acquainted and people cant get acquainted in a day

The first long hill was surmounted and away they bowled again past
cottage and farmhouse through strips of woodland and between fields
from which came the fragrance of the springing grass and the peepings
of the hylas The moon soon rose fullorbed above the higher eastern
hills and the mild April evening became luminous and full of beauty

A healing sense of quiet and security already began to steal into
Alidas bruised heart In turning her back upon the town in which she
had suffered so greatly she felt like one escaping from prison and
torture An increasing assurance of safety came with every mile the
cool still radiance of the night appeared typical of her new and most
unexpected experience Light had risen on her shadowed path but it
was not warm vivifying sunlight which stimulates and develops A few
hours before she was in darkness which might be feltyet it was a
gloom shot through and through with lurid threatening gleams It had
seemed to her that she had fallen from home happiness and honor to
unfathomed depths and yet there had appeared to be deeper and darker
abysses on every side She had shuddered at the thought of going out
into the world feeling that her misfortune would awaken suspicion
rather than sympathy scorn instead of kindness that she must toil on
until death to sustain a life to which death would come as Gods
welcome messenger Then had come this man at her side with his
comparatively trivial troubles and perplexities and he had asked her
helpshe who was so helpless He had banished despair from her
earthly future he had lifted her up and was bearing her away from all
which she had so dreaded nothing had been asked which her crushed
spirit was unable to bestow she was simply expected to aid him in his
natural wish to keep his home and to live where he had always dwelt
His very inability to understand her to see her broken trampled life
and immeasurable need as she saw it brought quietness of mind The
concentration of his thoughts on a few homely and simple hopes gave her
immunity With quick intuition she divined that she had not a
whimsical jealous exacting nature to deal with He was the plain
matteroffact man he seemed so literal and absolutely truthful that
he would appear odd to most people To her mind his were the traits
which she could now most welcome and value He knew all about her she
had merely to be herself to do what she had promised in order to rest
securely on his rocklike truth He had again touched a deep grateful
chord in speaking of her to the shopkeeper as his wife he showed no
disposition whatever to shrink from the relation before the world it
was evident that he meant to treat her with respect and kindness and
to exact respect from others For all this while sitting quietly and
silently at his side she thanked him almost passionately in her heart
but far more than for all this she was glad and grateful that he would
not expect what she now felt it would be impossible for her to
givethe love and personal devotion which had been inseparable from
marriage in her girlhood thoughts He would make good his wordsshe
should be his wife in name and be respected as such He was too simple
and true to himself and his buried love too considerate of her to
expect more She might hope therefore as he had said that they
might be helpful loyal friends and he would have been surprised indeed
had he known how the pale silent woman beside him was longing and
hoping to fill his home with comfort

Thoughts like these had inspired and sustained her while at the same
time ministering the balm of hope The quiet face of nature lovely in
the moonlight seemed to welcome and reassure her Happy are those
who when sorely wounded in life can turn to the natural world and
find in every tree shrub and flower a comforting friend that will not
turn from them Such are not far from God and peace

The range of Holcrofts thoughts was far simpler and narrower than
Alidas He turned rather deliberately from the past preferring to
dwell on the probable consummation of his hope His home his farm
were far more to him than the woman he had married He had wedded her
for their sake and his thoughts followed his heart which was in his
hillside acres It is said that women often marry for a home he truly
had done so to keep his home The question which now most occupied him
was the prospect of doing this through quiet prosperous years He
dwelt minutely on Alidas manner as well as her words and found
nothing to shake his belief that she had been as truthful as himself
Nevertheless he queried in regard to the future with not a little
anxiety In her present distress and poverty she might naturally be
glad of the refuge he had offered but as time passed and the poignancy
of bitter memories was allayed might not her life on the farm seem
monotonous and dull might not weariness and discontent come into her
eyes in place of gratitude Well well he concluded this marrying
is a risky experiment at best but Tom Watterlys talk and her manner
seemed to shut me up to it I was made to feel that I couldnt go on
in any other way and I havent done anything underhanded or wrong as
I see for the chance of going on If I hadnt become such a heathen I
should say there was a Providence in it but I dont know what to think
about such things any more Timell show and the prospect is better
than it has been yet Shell never be sorry if she carries out the
agreement made today if kindness and good will can repay her

Thus it may be seen that although two life currents had become
parallel they were still very distinct

By the time Holcroft approached the lane leading to his dwelling Alida
was growing very weary and felt that her endurance had almost reached
its limit Her face was so white in the moonlight that he asked
solicitously You can stand it a little longer cant you

Ill try Im very sorry Im not stronger

Dont you worry about that You wont know yourself in a week Here
we are at the lane and theres the house yonder A moment or two more
and youll be by the fire

A loud barking startled old Jonathan Johnson out of his doze and he
hastened to replenish the fire and to call off his rather savage dog
He was a little surprised to see Holcroft drive toward the kitchen door
with a woman by his side Hes tried his luck with another of them
town gals he muttered but Jerusalem She wont stay a week an
my old womanll have the washin an mendin all the same

He could scarcely believe his ears and eyes when he heard the farmer
say Alida you must let me lift you out and then saw the town gal
set gently on the ground her hand placed on Holcrofts arm as she was
supported slowly and carefully to the rocking chair beside the fire
Jonathan was the quiet announcement this is Mrs Holcroft my
wife

Jerubeg a pardon Wasnt spectin jis sich a turn o things
Respects missus Sorry to see yer enjyin poor health

Yes Jonathan Mrs Holcroft has been sick but shes much better and
will soon be well Shes very tired now from the long drive but quiet
life and country air will soon make her strong Ill just step out and
care for the horses Alida and soon be back again You come and help
me Jonathan and keep your dog off too

The old man complied with rather poor grace for he would have preferred
to interview the bride at whom he was staring with all his weak
watery eyes Holcroft understood his neighbors peculiarities too well
to subject his wife to this ordeal and was bent on dispatching
Jonathan homeward as soon as possible

I say Jim said the old guardsman who felt that he was speaking to
the boy he had known for thirty odd years where on airth did you pick
up sich a sickly lookin critter

I didnt pick her up replied the farmer laughingly I married her
fair and square just as you did your wife a hundred years ago more or
less Havent I as good a right to get married as you had

Oh I aint adisputin yer right but it seems so kind o suddint that
its taken what little breath Ive left

How do you know its sudden Did you go around telling everyone how
you were getting on when you were acourting

Well I swan Yer got me Taint so long ago that I disremember we
did it on the sly

Well now Uncle Jonathan youve got nothing to say against me for I
didnt marry on the sly although Ive gone on the principle that my
business wasnt everybodys business When I saw your wife about my
washing and mending I didnt know I was going to be lucky so soon You
know you cant marry a woman in this country till shes willing But
tell your wife she shant lose anything and the next time I go to town
Ill leave that settin of eggs she wanted Now Jonathan honor
bright do you feel able to walk home if I give you fifty cents extra

Why sartinly Spose Id take yer away on sich a casion My wife
wouldnt let me in if she knowed it

Well you and your wife are good neighbors and thats moren I can
say for most people in these parts Heres the money Mrs Holcroft
isnt strong or well enough to talk any tonight You got yourself a
good supper didnt you

Yes yes Helped myself bountfully Good night and good luck ter
yer I cant help thinkin it was kind o suddint though and then
shes sich a sickly lookin critter Hope yer havent been taken in
but then as you say the marryin business like other kinds o
business is a mans own business

I hope everyone will take your sensible view Uncle Jonathan Good
night



Chapter XXI

At Home

Alida was not so cold weary and almost faint but that she looked
around the old kitchen with the strongest interest This interest was
as unlike Mrs Mumpsons curiosity as she was unlike the widow It is
true the thought of self was prominent yet hers were not selfish
thoughts There are some blessed natures in the world that in doing
the best for themselves do the best that is possible for others

The genial warmth of the fire was grateful to her chilled and enfeebled
frame the homely kitchen with its dresser of china ware its tin
closet and pantry the doors of which old Jonathan had left open
manlike after helping himself bountfully all suggested more
comfort to this pallid bride sitting there alone than wealth of
ornament in elegant apartments has brought to many others She saw her
chief domain not in its coarse and common aspect but as her vantage
ground from which she could minister to the comforts of the one who
had rescued her Few brides would care to enter the kitchen first but
she was pleased she who had scarcely hoped to smile again looked
smilingly around on the quaint homelike room

And this is to be my home she murmured How strange unexpected
yet natural it all is Just what he led me to expect The little
lonely farmhouse where I can be safe from staring eyes and unwounded
by cruel questionings Yet that old man had a dozen questions on his
tongue I believe HE took him away to save my feelings Its strange
that so plain and simple a man in most respects can be so considerate
Oh pray God that all goes on as it promises I couldnt have dreamt
it this morning but I have an odd homelike feeling already Well
since I AM at home I may as well take off my hat and cloak

And she did so Holcroft entered and said heartily Thats right
Alida You are here to stay you know You mustnt think it amiss that
I left you a few moments alone for I had to get that talkative old man
off home Hes getting a little childish and would fire questions at
you pointblank

But shouldnt you have taken him home in the wagon I dont mind
being alone

Oh no Hes spry enough to walk twice the distance and often does
Its light as day outside and I made it right with him You can leave
your things upstairs in your room and Ill carry up your bundles also
if you are rested enough for the journey

Oh yes she replied Im feeling better already

He led the way to the apartment that Mrs Mumpson had occupied and said
regretfully Im sorry the room looks so bare and comfortless but
that will all be mended in time When you come down well have some
coffee and supper

She soon reappeared in the kitchen and he continued Now Ill show
you that Im not such a very helpless sort of man after all so if
youre sick you neednt worry Im going to get you a good cup of
coffee and broil you a piece of steak

Oh Please let me she began

No cant allow you to do anything tonight but sit in that chair You
promised to mind you know and he smiled so genially that she smiled
back at him although tears came into her eyes

I cant realize it all she said in a low voice To think how this
day began and how it is ending

Its ending in a poor mans kitchen Alida It was rather rough to
bring you in here first but the parlor is cold and comfortless

I would rather be brought here It seems to me that it must be a
light and cheerful room

Yes the sun shines in these east windows and theres another window
facing the south so its light all day long

She watched him curiously and with not a little selfreproach as he
deftly prepared supper Its too bad for me to sit idle while you do
such things yet you do everything so well that I fear I shall seem
awkward Still I think I do at least know how to cook a little

If you knew what Ive had to put up with for a year or more you
wouldnt worry about satisfying me in this respect Except when old
Mrs Wiggins was here I had few decent meals that I didnt get
myself and then to cheer her up he laughingly told her of Mrs
Mumpsons essay at making coffee He had a certain dry humor and his
unwonted effort at mimicry was so droll in itself that Alida was
startled to hear her own voice in laughter and she looked almost
frightened so deeply had she been impressed that it would never be
possible or even right for her to laugh again

The farmer was secretly much pleased at his success If she would
laugh be cheerful and not brood he felt sure she would get well and
be more contented The desperate view she had taken of her misfortunes
troubled him and he had thought it possible that she might sink into
despondency and something like invalidism but that involuntary bubble
of laughter reassured him Quiet wholesome cheerful life will
restore her to health he thought as he put his favorite beverage and
the sputtering steak on the table Now he said placing a chair at
the table you can pour me a cup of coffee

Im glad I can do something she answered for I cant get over the
strangeness of being so waited on Indeed everything that was
unexpected or undreamt of has happened and there was just the
faintest bit of color on her cheeks as she sat down opposite him

Few men are insensible to simple natural womanly grace and poor
Holcroft who so long had been compelled to see at his table perfect
terrors as he called them was agreeably impressed by the contrast
she made with the Mumpson and Malony species Alida unconsciously had
a subtle charm of carriage and action learned in her long past and
happy girlhood when all her associations were good and refined Still
in its truest explanation this grace is native and not acquired it is
a personal trait Incapable of nice analysis or fine definitions he
only thought How much pleasanter it is to see at the table a quiet
sensible woman instead of a peculiar female and it was not long
before he supplemented her remark by saying Perhaps things are
turning out for both of us better than we expected I had made up my
mind this morning to live here like a hermit get my own meals and all
that I actually had the rough draught of an auction bill in my
pocketyes here it is nowand was going to sell my cows give up
my dairy and try to make my living in a way that wouldnt require any
woman help Thats what took me up to Tom Watterlys I wanted him to
help me put the bill in shape He wouldnt look at it and talked me
right out of trying to live like Robinson Crusoe as he expressed it
I had been quite cheerful over my prospects indeed I was almost happy
in being alone again after having such terrors in the house But as I
said Watterly talked all the courage and hope right out of me and
made it clear that I couldnt go it alone You see Tom and I have
been friends since we were boys together and thats the reason he
talks so plain to me

He has a good kind heart said Alida I dont think I could have
kept up at all had it not been for his kindness

Yes Toms a rough diamond He dont make any pretenses and looks
upon himself as a rather hard case but I fancy hes doing kind things
in his rough way half the time Well as we were talking he
remembered you and he spoke of you so feelingly and told your story
with so much honest sympathy that he awoke my sympathy Now you know
how it has all come about You see its all natural enough and simple
enough and probably its the best thing that could have happened for
us both All you have to do is to get strong and well and then it
wont be any onesided affair as youve been too much inclined to
think I can go on and keep my farm and home just as my heart is bent
on doing I want you to understand everything for then your mind will
be more satisfied and at rest and thats half the battle in getting
over sickness and trouble like yours

I can only thank God and you for the great change in my prospects
This quiet and escape from strangers are just what I most craved and I
am already beginning to hope that if I can learn to do all you wish I
shall find a content that I never hoped for and the tears that stood
in her eyes were witnesses of her sincerity

Well dont expect to learn everything at once Let me have my way
for a while and then youll find as you get strong and the busy
season comes on that Ill be so taken up with the farm that youll
have your own way Wont you have some more steak No Well youve
enjoyed your supper a little havent you

Yes she replied smiling I actually felt hungry when I sat down
and the coffee has taken away the tired faint feeling

I hope youll soon be good and hungry three times a day he said
laughing pleasantly

Youll at least let me clear the table she asked I feel so much
better

Yes if you are sure youre strong enough It may make you feel more
at home But drop everything till tomorrow when tired I must go out
and do my night work and its night work now sure enough

Its too bad she said sympathetically

What To go out and feed my stock this clear bright night And
after a hearty supper too Such farming is fun I feel too as if I
wanted to go and pat the cows all around in my gladness that Im not
going to sell them Now remember let everything go till morning as
soon as you feel tired

She nodded smilingly and set to work Standing in the shadow of a
hemlock he watched her for a few moments Her movements were slow as
would be natural to one who had been so reduced by illness but this
every evidence of feebleness touched his feelings She is eager to
begintoo eager No nonsense there about menial tasks Well it
does give one hope to see such a woman as that in the old kitchen and
then the hungry cattle welcomed him

The traveler feels safe after the fierce Arab of the desert has broken
bread with him It would seem that a deep principle of human nature is
involved in this act More than the restoring power of the nourishment
itself was the moral effect for Alida of that first meal in her
husbands home It was another step in what he had said was
essentialthe forming of his acquaintance She had seen from the
first that he was plain and unpolishedthat he had not the veneer of
gentility of the man she had so mistakenly married yet in his simple
truth he was inspiring a respect which she had never felt for any man
before What element of real courtesy has been wanting she asked
herself If this is an earnest of the future thank God for the real
Ive found to my cost what a clever imitation of a man means

It was as sweet as it was strange to think that she who had trembled
at the necessity of becoming almost a slave to unfeeling strangers had
been compelled to rest while a husband performed tasks naturally hers
It was all very homely yet the significance of the act was chivalrous
consideration for her weakness the place the nature of the ministry
could not degrade the meaning of his action Then too during the
meal he had spoken natural kindly words which gave to their breaking
of bread together the true interpretation Although so feeble and
wary she found a deep satisfaction in beginning her household work
It does make me feel more at home she said Strange that he should
have thought of it

She had finished her task and sat down again when he entered with a
pail of milk Taking a dipper with a strainer on one side of it he
poured out a tumblerful Now take this he said Ive always heard
that milk fresh from the cow was very strengthening Then go and sleep
till you are thoroughly rested and dont think of coming down in the
morning till you feel like it Ill make the fire and get breakfast
You have seen how easily I can do it I have several more cows to milk
and so will say Goodnight

For the first time since chaos had come into her life Alida slept
soundly and refreshingly unpursued by the fears which had haunted even
her dreams When she awoke she expected to see the gray locks and
repulsive features of the woman who had occupied the apartment with her
at the almshouse but she was alone in a small strange room Then
memory gathered up the threads of the past but so strange so blessed
did the truth seem that she hastened to dress and go down to the old
kitchen and assure herself that her mind had not become shattered by
her troubles and was mocking her with unreal fancies The scene she
looked upon would have soothed and reassured her even had her mind been
as disordered as she for the moment had been tempted to believe
There was the same homely room which had pictured itself so deeply in
her memory the evening before Now it was more attractive for the
morning sun was shining into it lighting up its homely details with a
wholesome cheerful reality which made it difficult to believe that
there were tragic experiences in the world The wood fire in the stove
crackled merrily and the lid of the kettle was already bobbing up and
down from internal commotion

As she opened the door a burst of song entered securing her attention
She had heard the birds before without recognizing consciousness as is
so often true of our own condition in regard to the familiar sounds of
nature It was now almost as if she had received another sense so
strong sweet and cheering was the symphony Robins songsparrows
blackbirds seemed to have gathered in the trees nearby to give her a
jubilant welcome but she soon found that the music shaded off to
distant dreamlike notes and remembered that it was a morning chorus
of a hemisphere This universality did not render the melody less
personally grateful We can appreciate all that is lovely in Nature
yet leave all for others As she stood listening and inhaling the
soft air full of the delicious perfume of the grass and expanding
buds and looking through the misty sunshine on the halfveiled
landscape she heard Holcrofts voice chiding some unruly animal in
the barnyard

This recalled her and with the elasticity of returning health and hope
she set about getting breakfast

It seems to me that I never heard birds sing before she thought
and their songs this morning are almost like the music of heaven
They seem as happy and unconscious of fear and trouble as if they were
angels Mother and I used to talk about the Garden of Eden but could
the air have been sweeter or the sunshine more tempered to just the
right degree of warmth and brightness than here about my home Oh
thank God again again and forever for a home like this and for a
few moments something of the ecstasy of one delivered from the black
thraldom of evil filled her soul She paused now and then to listen to
the birds for only their songs seemed capable of expressing her
emotion It was but another proof that heavenly thoughts and homely
work may go on together



Chapter XXII

Getting Acquainted

It was still early and Holcroft was under the impression that Alida
would sleep late after the severe fatigues of the preceding day He
therefore continued his work at the barn sufficiently long to give his
wife time for her little surprise She was not long in finding and
laying her hands on the simple materials for breakfast A ham hung in
the pantry and beneath it was a great basket of eggs while the flour
barrel stood in the corner Biscuits were soon in the oven eggs
conjured into an omelet and the ham cut into delicate slices instead
of great coarse steaks

Remembering Mrs Mumpsons failure with the coffee she made it a
trifle strong and boiled the milk that should temper without cooling
it The biscuits rose like her own spirits the omelet speedily began
to take on color like her own flushed face as she busied herself about
the stove

Everything was nearly ready when she saw Holcroft coming toward the
house with two pails of milk He took them to the large dairy room
under the parlor and then came briskly to the kitchen

She stood screened by the door as he entered then stopped and stared
at the table all set and at the inviting breakfast on the stove

Seeing Alidas halfsmiling halfquestioning face seeking his
approval he exclaimed Well you HAVE stolen a march on me I
supposed you were asleep yet

I felt so much stronger and better when I awoke that I thought you
wouldnt mind if I came down and made a beginning

You call this a beginning do you Such a breakfast as this before
seven in the morning I hope you havent overtaxed yourself

No only a little of just the right kind of tired feeling

Havent you left anything for me to do

Perhaps You will know when Ive put all on the table What Ive
prepared is ready

Well this is famous Ill go and wash and fix up a little and be
right down

When Holcroft returned he looked at her curiously for he felt that
he too was getting acquainted Her thin face was made more youthful
by color a pleased look was in her blue eyes and a certain neatness
and trimness about her dress to which he had not been accustomed He
scanned the table wonderingly for things were not put upon it at
haphazard the light biscuits turned their brown cheeks invitingly
toward himshe had arranged that they should do thatthe ham was
crisp not sodden and the omelet as russet as a November leaf This
is a new dish he said looking at it closely What do you call it

Omelet Perhaps you wont like it but mother used to be very fond of
it

No matter Well have it if you like it and it brings you pleasant
thoughts of your mother Then he took a good sip of coffee and set
the cup down again as he had before under the Mumpson regime but with
a very different expression She looked anxiously at him but was
quickly reassured I thought I knew how to make coffee but I find I
dont I never tasted anything so good as that How DO you make it

Just as mother taught me

Well well And you call this making a beginning I just wish I
could give Tom Watterly a cup of this coffee It would set his mind at
rest By jocks he would say isnt this better than going it
alone

She looked positively happy under this sweet incense to a housewifely
heart She was being paid in the coin that women love best and it was
all the more precious to her because she had never expected to receive
it again

He did like the omelet he liked everything and after helping her
liberally cleared the table then said he felt equal to doing two
mens work Before going out to his work he lighted a fire on the
parlor hearth and left a good supply of fuel beside it Now Alida
he remarked humorously Ive already found out that you have one fault
that you and I will have to watch against You are too willing I fear
youve gone beyond your strength this morning I dont want you to do
a thing today except to get the meals and remember I can help in this
if you dont feel well There is a fire in the parlor and Ive
wheeled the lounge up by it Take it quietly today and perhaps
tomorrow I can begin to show you about buttermaking

I will do as you wish she replied but please show me a little more
where things are before you go out

This he did and added Youll find the beef and some other things on a
swingshelf in the cellar The potato bins are down there too But
dont try to get up much dinner What comes quickest and easiest will
suit me Im a little backward with my work and must plow all day for
oats Its time they were in After such a breakfast I feel as if I
had eaten a bushel myself

A few moments later she saw him going up the lane that continued on
past the house with his stout team and the plow and she smiled as she
heard him whistling Coronation with levity as some good people would
have thought

Plowing and planting time had come and under happier auspices
apparently than he had ever imagined possible again With the lines
about his neck he began with a sidehill plow at the bottom of a large
sloping field which had been in corn the previous year and the long
straight furrows increased from a narrow strip to a wide oblong area
Ah said he in tones of strong satisfaction the ground crumbles
freely its just in the right condition Ill quit plowing this
afternoon in time to harrow and sow all the ground thats ready Then
so muchll be all done and well done Its curious how seed if it
goes into the ground at the right time and in the right way comes
right along and never gets discouraged I aint much on scientific
farming but Ive always observed that when I sow or plant as soon as
the ground is ready I have better luck

The horses seemed infected by his own brisk spirit stepping along
without urging and the farmer was swept speedily into the full strong
current of his habitual interests

One might have supposed the recent events would have the uppermost
place in his thoughts but this was not true He rather dwelt upon
them as the unexpectedly fortunate means to the end now attained This
was his life and he was happy in the thought that his marriage
promised to make this life not merely possible but prosperous and full
of quiet content

The calling of the born agriculturist like that of the fisherman has
in it the element of chance and is therefore full of moderate yet
lasting excitement Holcroft knew that although he did his best much
would depend on the weather and other causes He had met with
disappointments in his crops and had also achieved what he regarded as
fine successes although they would have seemed meager on a Western
prairie Every spring kindled anew his hopefulness and anticipation
He watched the weather with the interested and careful scrutiny of a
sailor and it must be admitted that his labor and its results depended
more on natural causes than upon his skill and the careful use of the
fertilizers He was a farmer of the old school the traditions
received from his father controlled him in the main Still his good
common sense and long experience stood him fairly well in the place of
science and knowledge of improved methods and he was better equipped
than the man who has in his brain all that the books can teach yet is
without experience Best of all he had inherited and acquired an
abiding love of the soil he never could have been content except in
its cultivation he was therefore in the right condition to assimilate
fuller knowledge and make the most of it

He knew well enough when it was about noon From long habit he would
have known had the sky been overcast but now his glance at the sun was
like looking at a watch Dusty and begrimed he followed his team to
the barn slipped from them their headstalls and left them to amuse
themselves with a little hay while they cooled sufficiently for
heartier food Well now he mused I wonder what that little woman
has for dinner Another new dish like enough Hanged if Im fit to
go in the house and she looking so trim and neat I think Ill first
take a souse in the brook and he went up behind the house where an
unfailing stream gurgled swiftly down from the hills At the nearest
point a small basin had been hollowed out and as he approached he saw
two or three speckled trout darting away through the limpid water

Aha he muttered glad you reminded me When SHES stronger she
may enjoy catching our supper some afternoon I must think of all the
little things I can to liven her up so she wont get dull Its
curious how interested I am to know how shes got along and what she
has for dinner And to think that less than a week ago I used to
hate to go near the house

As he entered the hall on his way to his room that he might make
himself more presentable an appetizing odor greeted him and Alida
smiled from the kitchen door as she said Dinners ready

Apparently she had taken him at his word as she had prepared little
else than an Irish stew yet when he had partaken of it he thought he
would prefer Irish stews from that time onward indefinitely Where did
you learn to cook Alida he asked

Mother wasnt very strong and her appetite often failed her Then
too we hadnt much to spend on our table so we tried to make simple
things taste nice Do you like my way of preparing that oldfashioned
dish

Im going to show you how I like it he replied nodding approvingly
Well what have you been doing besides tempting me to eat too much

What you said resting You told me not to get up much of a dinner
so I very lazily prepared what you see Ive been lying on the lounge
most of the morning

Famous and you feel better

Yes I think I shall soon get well and strong she replied looking
at him gratefully

Well well My lucks turned at last I once thought it never would
but if this goes onwell you cant know what a change it is for the
better I can now put my mind on my work

Youve been plowing all the morning havent you she ventured and
there was the pleased look in her eyes that he already liked to see

Yes he replied and I must keep at it several days to get in all
the oats I mean to sow If this weather holds I shall be through next
week

I looked in the milkroom a while ago Isnt there anything I could
do there this afternoon

No Ill attend to everything there Its too damp for you yet
Keep on resting Why bless me I didnt think youd be well enough
to do anything for a week

Indeed she admitted Im surprised at myself It seems as if a
crushing weight had been lifted off my mind and that I was coming right
up Im so glad for I feared I might be feeble and useless a long
time

Well Alida if you had been or if you ever are dont think Ill be
impatient The people I cant stand are those who try to take
advantage of me and I tell you Ive had to contend with that
disposition so long that I feel as if I could do almost anything for
one who is simply honest and tries to keep her part of an agreement
But this wont do Ive enjoyed my own dinner so much that Ive half
forgotten that the horses havent had theirs yet Now will you scold
if I light my pipe before I go out

Oh no I dont mind that

No goodnatured fibs Isnt smoke disagreeable

She shook her head I dont mind it at all she said but her sudden
paleness puzzled him He could not know that he had involuntarily
recalled the many times that she had filled the evening pipe for a man
who now haunted her memory like a specter

I guess you dont like it very much he said as he passed out
Well no matter Its getting so mild that I can smoke out of doors

With the exception of the episode of dinner the day was chiefly passed
by Alida in a healthrestoring languor the natural reaction from the
distress and strong excitements of the past The rest that had been
enjoined upon her was a blessed privilege and still more happy was the
truth that she could rest Reclining on the lounge in the parlor with
a wood fire on one side and the April sun on the other both creating
warmth and good cheer she felt like those who have just escaped from a
wreck and engulfing waves Her mind was too weary to question either
the past or the future and sometimes a consciousness of safety is
happiness in itself In the afternoon the crackling of the fire and
the calling and singing of the birds without formed a soothing lullaby
and she fell asleep

At last in a dream she heard exquisite music which appeared to grow
so loud strong and triumphant that she started up and looked around
bewildered A moment later she saw that a robin was singing in a
lilac bush by the window and that near the bird was a nest partially
constructed She recalled her hopeless grief when she had last seen
the building of one of their little homes and she fell upon her knees
with a gratitude too deep for words and far more grateful to Heaven
than words

Stepping out on the porch she saw by the shadows that the sun was low
in the west and that Holcroft was coming down the lane with his horses
He nodded pleasantly as he passed on to the barn Her eyes followed
him lingeringly till he disappeared and then they ranged over the wide
valley and the wooded hills in the distance Not a breath of air was
stirring the lowing of cattle and other rural sounds softened by
distance came from other farmhouses the birds were at vespers and
their songs to her fancy were imbued with a softer sweeter melody
than in the morning From the adjacent fields came clear mellow notes
that made her nerves tingle so ethereal yet penetrating were they
She was sure she had never heard such bird music before When Holcroft
came in to supper she asked What birds are those that sing in the
field

Meadow larks Do you like them

I never heard a hymn sung that did me more good

Well I own up Id rather hear em than much of the singing we used
to have down at the meeting house

It seems to me she remarked as she sat down at the table that
Ive never heard birds sing as they have today

Now I think of it they have been tuning up wonderfully Perhaps
theyve an idea of my good luck he added smilingly

I had thought of that about myself she ventured I took a nap this
afternoon and a robin sang so near the window that he woke me up It
was a pleasant way to be waked

Took a nap did you Thats famous Well well This days gone
just to suit me and I havent had many such in a good while I can
tell you Ive got in a big strip of oats and now when I come in
tired heres a good supper I certainly shall have to be on the watch
to do Tom Watterly good turns for talking me into this business That
taking a nap was a firstrate idea You ought to keep it up for a
month

No indeed Theres no reason why you should work hard and I be idle
Ive rested today as you wished and I feel better than I ever
expected to again but tomorrow I must begin in earnest What use is
there of your keeping your cows if good butter is not made Then I
must be busy with my needle

Yes thats true enough See how thoughtless I am I forgot you
hadnt any clothes to speak of I ought to take you to town to a
dressmaker

I think you had better get your oats in she replied smiling shyly
Besides I have a dressmaker that just suits meone thats made my
dresses a good many years

If she dont suit you youre hard to be suited said he laughing
Well some day after you are fixed up I shall have to let you know
how dilapidated I am

 Wont you do me a little favor

Oh yes A dozen of em big or little

Please bring down this evening something that needs mending I am so
much better

No no I wasnt hinting for you to do anything tonight

But youve promised me she urged Remember Ive been resting
nearly all day Im used to sewing and earned my living at it
Somehow it dont seem natural for me to sit with idle hands

If I hadnt promised

But you have

I suppose Im fairly caught and he brought down a little of the most
pressing of the mending

Now Ill reward you she said handing him his pipe well filled
You go in the parlor and have a quiet smoke I wont be long in
clearing up the kitchen

What Smoke in the parlor

Yes why not I assure you I dont mind it

Ha Ha Why didnt I think of it beforeI might have kept the parlor
and smoked Mrs Mumpson out

It wont be smoke that will keep me out

I should hope not or anything else I must tell you how I DID have
to smoke Mrs Mumpson out at last and he did so with so much drollery
that she again yielded to irrepressible laughter

Poor thing Im sorry for her she said

Im sorry for Janepoor little stray cat of a child I hope we can
do something for her some day and having lighted his pipe he took up
the county paper left weekly in a hollow tree by the stage driver and
went into the parlor

After freshening up the fire he sat down to read but by the time she
joined him the tired man was nodding He tried to brighten up but his
eyes were heavy

Youve worked hard today she said sympathetically

Well I have he answered Ive not done such a good days work in a
year

Then why dont you go to sleep at once

It dont seem polite

Please dont talk that way she interrupted I dont mind being
alone at all I shall feel a great deal more at home if you forget all
about ceremony

Well Alida I guess we had both better begin on that basis If I
give up when Im tired you must You mustnt think Im always such a
sleepyhead The fact is Ive been more tired out with worry of late
than with work I can laugh about it now but Ive been so desperate
over it that Ive felt more like swearing Youll find out Ive become
a good deal of a heathen

Very well Ill wait till I find out

I think we are getting acquainted famously dont you

Yes she nodded with a smile that meant more than a long speech
Good night



Chapter XXIII

Between the Past and Future

Human nature in common with Mother Nature has its immutable laws
The people who existed before the flood were in their primal motives
like those of today The conventionality of highly civilized society
does not change the heart but it puts so much restraint upon it that
not a few appear heartless They march through life and fight its
battles like uniformed men trained in a certain school of tactics
The monotony of character and action is superficial in most cases
rather than real and he who fathoms the eyes of others who catches
the subtle quality of tones and interprets the flexible mouth that
utters them will discover that the whole gamut of human nature exists
in those that appear only like certain musical instruments made by
machinery to play a few wellknown tunes Conventional restraint
often no doubt produces dwarfed and defective human nature I
suppose that if souls could be put under a microscope the undeveloped
rudiments of almost everything would be discovered It is more
satisfactory to study the things themselves than their suggestions
this we are usually better able to do among people of simple and
untrammeled modes of life who are not practiced in disguises Their
peculiar traits and their general and dominant laws and impulses are
exhibited with less reserve than by those who have learned to be always
on their guard Of course there are commonplace yeomen as truly as
commonplace aristocrats and simple life abounds in simpletons

When a man in Holcrofts position has decided traits they are apt to
have a somewhat full expression his rugged nature beside a tamer one
outlines itself more vividly just as a mountain peak is silhouetted
against the horizon better than a rounded hill It probably has been
observed that his character possessed much simplicity and directness
He had neither the force nor the ambition to raise him above his
circumstances he was merely decided within the lines of his
environment Perhaps the current of his life was all the stronger for
being narrow His motives were neither complex nor vacillating He had
married to keep his home and to continue in the conditions of life dear
from association and the strongest preference and his heart overflowed
with good will and kindness toward Alida because she promised to solve
the hard problem of the future satisfactorily Apart from the sympathy
which her misfortune had evoked he probably could have felt much the
same toward any other good sensible woman had she rendered him a
similar service It is true now that Alida was in his home that she
was manifesting agreeable traits which gave him pleasant little
surprises He had not expected that he would have had half so much to
say to her yet felt it his duty to be sociable in order to cheer up
and mark the line between even a business marriage and the employment
of a domestic Both his interest and his duty required that he should
establish the bonds of strong friendly regard on the basis of perfect
equality and he would have made efforts similar to those he put
forth in behalf of any woman if she had consented to marry him with
Alidas understanding Now however that his suddenly adopted project
of securing a housekeeper and helper had been consummated he would
find that he was not dealing with a business partner in the abstract
but a definite woman who had already begun to exert over him her
natural influence He had expected more or less constraint and that
some time must elapse before his wife would cease to be in a sense
company whom he with conscious and deliberate effort must entertain
On the contrary she entertained and interested him although she said
so little and by some subtle power she unloosed his tongue and made it
easy for him to talk to her In the most quiet and unobtrusive way
she was not only making herself at home but him also she was very
subservient to his wishes but not servilely so she did not assert
but only revealed her superiority and after even so brief an
acquaintance he was ready to indorse Tom Watterlys view Shes out of
the common run

While all this was true the farmers heart was as untouched as that of
a child who simply and instinctively likes a person He was still
quietly and unhesitatingly loyal to his former wife Apart from his
involuntary favor his shrewd practical reason was definite enough in
its grounds of approval Reason assured him that she promised to do and
to be just what he had married her for but this might have been true
of a capable yet disagreeable woman whom he could not like to save
himself

Both in regard to himself and Alida Holcroft accepted the actual facts
with the gladness and much of the unquestioning simplicity of a child
This rather risky experiment was turning out well and for a time he
daily became more and more absorbed in his farm and its interests
Alida quietly performed her household tasks and proved that she would
not need very much instruction to become a good butter maker The
short spring of the North required that he should be busy early and
late to keep pace with the quickly passing seedtime His hopefulness
his freedom from household worries prompted him to sow and plant
increased areas of land In brief he entered on just the
businesslike honeymoon he had hoped for

Alida was more than content with the conditions of her life She saw
that Holcroft was not only satisfied but also pleased with her and
that was all she had expected and indeed all that thus far she had
wished or hoped She had many sad hours wounds like hers cannot heal
readily in a true sensitive womans heart While she gained in
cheerfulness and confidence the terrible and unexpected disaster which
had overtaken her rendered impossible the serenity of those with whom
all has gone well Dread of something she knew not what haunted her
painfully and memory at times seemed malignantly perverse in recalling
one whom she prayed to forget

Next to her faith and Holcrofts kindness her work was her best solace
and she thanked God for the strength to keep busy

On the first Sunday morning after their marriage the farmer overslept
and breakfast had been ready some time when he came down He looked
with a little dismay at the clock over the kitchen mantel and asked
Arent you going to scold a little

She shook her head nor did she look the chiding which often might as
well be spoken

How long have I kept breakfast waiting or you rather

What difference does it make You needed the rest The breakfast may
not be so nice was her smiling answer

No matter You are nice to let a man off in that way Observing the
book in her lap he continued So you were reading the old family
Bible to learn lessons of patience and forbearance

Again she shook her head She often oddly reminded him of Jane in her
employment of signs instead of speech but in her case there was a
grace a suggestiveness and even a piquancy about them which made them
like a new language He understood and interpreted her frankly I
know Alida he said kindly you are a good woman You believe in
the Bible and love to read it

I was taught to read and love it she replied simply Then her eyes
dropped and she faltered Ive reproached myself bitterly that I
rushed away so hastily that I forgot the Bible my mother gave me

No no he said heartily dont reproach yourself for that It was
the Bible in your heart that made you act as you did

She shot him a swift grateful glance through her tears but made no
other response

Having returned the Bible to the parlor she put the breakfast on the
table and said quietly It looks as if we would have a rainy day

Well said he laughing Im as bad as the old womanit seems that
women can run farms alone if men cant Well this old dame had a big
farm and employed several men and she was always wishing it would rain
nights and Sundays Im inclined to chuckle over the good this rain
will do my oats instead of being sorry to think how many sinners itll
keep from church Except in protractedmeeting times most people of
this town would a great deal rather risk their souls than be caught in
the rain on Sunday We dont mind it much week days but Sunday rain
is very dangerous to health

Im afraid Im as bad as the rest she said smiling Mother and I
usually stayed home when it rained hard

Oh we dont need a hard storm in the country People say It looks
threatening and that settles it but we often drive to town rainy
days to save time

Do you usually go to church at the meeting house I see off in the
valley she asked

I dont go anywhere and he watched keenly to see how she would take
this blunt statement of his practical heathenism

She only looked at him kindly and accepted the fact

Why dont you pitch into me he asked

That wouldnt do any good

Youd like to go I suppose

No not under the circumstances unless you wished to Im cowardly
enough to dread being stared at

He gave a deep sign of relief This thing has been troubling me he
said I feared you would want to go and if you did I should feel
that you ought to go

I fear Im very weak about it but I shrink so from meeting strangers
I do thank God for his goodness many times a day and ask for help Im
not brave enough to do any more yet

His rugged features became very somber as he said I wish I had as
much courage as you have

You dont understand me she began gently

No I suppose not Its all become a muddle to me I mean this
church and religious business

She looked at him wistfully as if she wished to say something but did
not venture to do so He promptly gave a different turn to the
conversation by quoting Mrs Mumpsons tirade on churchgoing the first
Sunday after her arrival Alida laughed but not in a wholly mirthful
and satisfied way There he concluded Im touching on things a
little too sacred for you I respect your feelings and beliefs for
they are honest and I wish I shared in em Then he suddenly laughed
again as he added Mrs Mumpson said there was too much milking done
on Sunday and its time I was breaking the Fourth Commandment after
her notion

Alida now laughed outright without reservation

By jocks as Watterly says what a difference there is in women he
soliloquized on his way to the barn Well the church question is
settled for the present but if Alida should ask me to go after her
manner this morning Id face the whole creation with her

When at last he came in and threw off his waterproof coat the kitchen
was in order and his wife was sitting by the parlor fire with Thomsons
Land and the Book in her hand

Are you fond of reading he asked

Yes very

Well I am too sort of but Ive let the years slip by without doing
half as much as I ought

Light your pipe and Ill read to you if you wish me to

Oh come now I at least believe in Sunday as a day of rest and you
need it Reading aloud is about as hard work as I can do

But Im used to it I read aloud to mother a great deal and then
there passed over her face an expression of deep pain

What is it Alida Dont you feel well

Yes oh yes she replied hastily and her pale face became crimson

It was another stab of memory recalling the many Sundays she had read
to the man who had deceived her Shall I read she asked

Alida he said very kindly it wasnt the thought of your mother
that brought that look of pain into your face

She shook her head sadly with downcast eyes After a moment or two
she raised them appealingly to him as she said simply There is so
much that I wish I could forget

Poor child Yes I think I know Be patient with yourself and
remember that you were never to blame

Again came that quick grateful glance by which some women express more
than others can ever put in words Her thought was I didnt think
that even he was capable of that What a way of assuring me that hell
be patient with me Then she quietly read for an hour descriptions of
the Holy Land that were not too religious for Holcrofts mind and which
satisfied her conscience better than much she had read in former days
to satisfy a taste more alien to hers than that of her husband

Holcroft listened to her correct pronunciation and sweet natural tones
with a sort of pleased wonder At last he said You must stop now

Are you tired she asked

No but you are or ought to be Why Alida I didnt know you were
so well educated Im quite a barbarous old fellow compared with you

I hadnt thought of that before she said with a laugh

What a fool I was then to put it into your head

You must be more careful Id never have such thoughts if you didnt
suggest them

How did you come to get such a good education

I wish I had a better one Well I did have good advantages up to the
time I was seventeen After I was old enough I went to school quite
steadily but it seems to me that I learned a little of everything and
not much of anything When father died and we lost our property we had
to take to our needles I suppose I might have obtained work in a
store or some such place but I couldnt bear to leave mother alone
and I disliked being in public I certainly didnt know enough to
teach and besides I was afraid to try

Well well Youve stumbled into a quiet enough place at last

Thats what I like most about it but I dont think I stumbled into
it I think Ive been led and helped Thats what I meant when I said
you didnt understand me she added hesitatingly It doesnt take
courage for me to go to God I get courage by believing that he cares
for me like a father as the bible says How could I ever have found
so kind a friend and good a home myself

Ive been half inclined to believe theres a Providence in it
myselfmore and more so as I get acquainted with you Your troubles
have made you better Alida mine made me worse I used to be a
Christian I aint any more

She looked at him smilingly as she asked How do you know

Oh I know well enough he replied gloomily Dont lets talk about
it any more and then he led her on to speak simply and naturally
about her childhood home and her father and mother

Well he said heartily I wish your mother was living for nothing
would please me better than to have such a good old lady in the house

She averted her face as she said huskily I think it was better she
died before But she did not finish the sentence

By the time dinner was over the sun was shining brightly and he asked
her if she would not like to go up the lane to his woodland to see the
view Her pleased look was sufficient answer But are you sure you
are strong enough he persisted

Yes it will do me good to go out and I may find some wild flowers

I guess you can a million or two

By the time he was through at the barn she was ready and they started
up the lane now green with late April grass and enlivened with
dandelions in which bumblebees were wallowing The sun had dried the
moisture sufficiently for them to pass on dryshod but everything had
the fresh vernal aspect that follows a warm rain Spring had advanced
with a great bound since the day before The glazed and glutinous
cherry buds had expanded with aromatic odors and the white of the
blossoms was beginning to show

By tomorrow said Holcroft the trees will look as if covered with
snow Let me help you and he put his hand under her arm supporting
and aiding her steps up the steep places

Her lips were parted the pleased look was in her eyes as they rested
on trees and shrubs which lined the half ruinous stone walls on either
side Everything seems so alive and glad this afternoon she remarked

Yes replied the matteroffact farmer A rain such as we had this
morning is like turning the water on a big millwheel It starts all
the machinery right up Now the suns out and thats the greatest
motor power of all Sun and moisture make the farm go

Mustnt the ground be enriched too

Yes yes indeed I suppose thats where we all fail But its no easy
matter to keep a farm in good heart Thats another reason why Im so
glad I wont have to sell my stock A farm run without stock is sure
to grow poor and if the farm grows poor the owner does as a matter of
course But what put enriching the ground into your head Do you know
anything about farming

No but I want to learn When I was a girl father had a garden He
used to take papers about it and I often read them aloud to him
evenings Now I remember there used to be much in them about enriching
the ground Do you take any such paper

No I havent much faith in bookfarming

I dont know she ventured Seems to me you might get some good
ideas out of papers and your experience would teach you whether they
were useful ideas or not If youll take one Ill read it to you

I will then for the pleasure of hearing you read if nothing else
Thats something I hadnt bargained for he added laughing

She answered in the same spirit by saying Ill throw that in and not
call it square yet

I think Ive got the best of you he chuckled and you know nothing
makes a Yankee farmer happier than to get the best of a bargain

I hope youll continue to think so Can I sit down a few moments

Why certainly How forgetful I am Your talk is too interesting for
me to think of anything else and he placed her on a flat rock by the
side of the lane while he leaned against the wall

Bees and other insects were humming around them a butterfly fluttered
over the fence and alighted on a dandelion almost at her feet meadow
larks were whistling their limpid notes in the adjoining fields while
from the trees about the house beneath them came the songs of many
birds blending with the babble of the brook which ran not far away

Oh how beautiful how strangely beautiful it all is

Yes when you come to think of it it is real pretty he replied
Its a pity we get so used to such things that we dont notice em
much I should feel miserable enough though if I couldnt live in
just such a place I shouldnt wonder if I was a good deal like that
robin yonder I like to be free and enjoy the spring weather but I
suppose neither he nor I think or know how fine it all is

Well both you and the robin seem a part of it she said laughing

Oh no no he replied with a guffaw which sent the robin off in
alarm I aint beautiful and never was

She joined his laugh but said with a positive little nod Im right
though The robin isnt a pretty bird yet everybody likes him

Except in cherry time Then he has an appetite equal to mine But
everybody dont like me In fact I think Im generally disliked in
this town

If you went among them more they wouldnt dislike you

I dont want to go among them

They know it and thats the reason they dislike you

Would you like to go out to teadrinkings and all that

No indeed and I dont suppose Id be received she added sadly

So much the worse for them then blast em said Holcroft wrathfully

Oh no I dont feel that way and you shouldnt When they can
people ought to be sociable and kind

Of course Id do any of my neighbors except Lemuel Weeks a good turn
if it came in my way but the less I have to do with them the better
Im satisfied

Im rested enough to go on now said Alida quietly

They were not long in reaching the edge of the woodland from which
there was an extended prospect For some little time they looked at
the wide landscape in silence Alida gave to it only partial attention
for her mind was very busy with thoughts suggested by her husbands
alienation from his neighbors It would make it easier for her but the
troubled query would arise Is it right or best for him His marrying
me will separate him still more

Holcrofts face grew sad rather than troubled as he looked at the old
meeting house and not at the landscape He was sitting near the spot
where he spent that long forenoon a few Sundays before and the train
of thought came back again In his deep abstraction he almost forgot
the woman near him in memories of the past

His old love and lost faith were inseparable from that little white
spire in the distance

Alida stole a glance at him and thought Hes thinking of her and
she quietly strolled away to look for wild flowers

Yes muttered Holcroft at last I hope Bessie knows Shed be the
first one to say it was right and best for me and shed be glad to
know that in securing my own home and comfort I had given a home to the
homeless and sorrowfula quiet good woman who worships God as she
did

He rose and joined his wife who held toward him a handful of trailing
arbutus rue anemones bloodroot and dicentras I didnt know they
were so pretty before he said with a smile

His smile reassured her for it seemed kinder than any she had yet
received and his tone was very gentle His dead wife will never be my
enemy she murmured He has made it right with her in his own
thoughts



Chapter XXIV

Given Her Own Way

On Monday the absorbing work of the farm was renewed and every day
brought to Holcroft long and exhausting hours of labor While he was
often taciturn he evidently progressed in cheerfulness and hope
Alida confirmed his good impressions His meals were prompt and
inviting the house was taking on an aspect of neatness and order long
absent and his wardrobe was put in as good condition as its rather
meager character permitted He had positively refused to permit his
wife to do any washing and ironing We will see about it next fall
he said If then you are perfectly well and strong perhaps but not
in the warm weather now coming on Then he added with a little nod
Im finding out how valuable you are and Id rather save you than the
small sum I have to pay old Mrs Johnson

In this and in other ways he showed kindly consideration but his mind
continually reverted to his work and outdoor plans with the
preoccupation of one who finds that he can again give his thoughts to
something from which they had been most reluctantly withdrawn Thus
Alida was left alone most of the time When the dusk of evening came
he was too tired to say much and he retired early that he might be
fresh for work again when the sun appeared She had no regrets for
although she kept busy she was resting and her wounds were healing
through the long quiet days

It was the essential calm after the storm Caring for the dairy and
working the butter into firm sweet tempting yellow rolls were the
only tasks that troubled her a little but Holcroft assured her that
she was learning these important duties faster than he had expected her
to She had several hours a day in which to ply her needle and thus
was soon enabled to replenish her scanty wardrobe

One morning at breakfast she appeared in another gown and although its
material was calico she had the appearance to Holcroft of being
unusually well dressed He looked pleased but made no comment When
the cherry blossoms were fully out an old cracked flower vasethe
only one in the housewas filled with them and they were placed in
the center of the dinner table He looked at them and her then
smilingly remarked I shouldnt wonder if you enjoyed those cherry
blows more than anything else we have for dinner

I want something else though My appetite almost frightens me

Thats famous I neednt be ashamed of mine then

One evening before the week was over he saw her busy with a rake
about the door Last years leaves were still scattered about with
twigs and even small boughs wrested by the winds from the trees He
was provoked with himself that he had neglected the usual spring
clearing away of litter and a little irritated that she should have
tried to do the work herself He left the horses at the barn and came
forward directly Alida he said gravely theres no need of your
doing such work I dont like to see you do it

Why she replied Ive heard that women in the country often milk
and take care of the chickens

Yes but thats very different from this work I wouldnt like people
to think I expected such things of you

Its very easy work she said smilingly easier than sweeping a
room though something like it I used to do it at home when I was a
girl I think it does me good to do something in the open air

She was persisting but not in a way that chafed him Indeed as he
looked into her appealing eyes and face flushed with exercise he felt
that it would be churlish to say another word

Well he said laughing it makes you look so young and rosy I guess
it does you good I suppose youll have to have your own way

You know I wouldnt do this or anything else if you really didnt want
me to

You are keen he replied with his good nature entirely restored
You can see that you get me right under your thumb when you talk that
way But we must both be on our guard against your fault you know or
pretty soon youll be taking the whole work of the farm off my hands

To be serious she resumed accompanying him to the barn for the
first time I think YOU are working too hard Im not Our meals are
so simple that it doesnt take me long to get them Im through with
the hurry in my sewing the old dog does the churning and you give me
so much help in the dairy that I shall soon have time on my hands Now
it seems to me that I might soon learn to take entire care of the
chickens big and little and that would be so much less for you to
look after Im sure I would enjoy it very much especially the
looking after the little chickens

So you really think youd like to do that he asked as he turned to
her from unharnessing the horses

Yes indeed if you think Im competent

You are more so than I am Somehow little chickens dont thrive
under a busy mans care The mother hens mean well but they are so
confoundedly silly I declare to you that last year I lost half the
little chicks that were hatched out

Well then she replied laughing I wont be afraid to try for I
think I can beat you in raising chickens Now show me how much you
feed them at night and how much Im to give them in the morning and
let me take the whole care of them for a month get the eggs and all
If they dont do so well then Ill resign I cant break you in a
month

It looks more as if youd make me You have a good big bump of order
and I havent any at all in little things Tom Watterly was right If
I had tried to live here alone things would have got into an awful
mess I feel ashamed of myself that I didnt clear up the yard before
but my whole minds been on the main crops

As it should be Dont you worry about the little things They
belong to me Now show me about the chickens or theyll go to roost
while were talking

But I as well as the chickens shall want some supper

I wont let either of you starve Youll see

Well you see this little measure You fill it from this bin with
this mixture of corn and wheat screenings Thats the allowance
morning and evening Then you go out to the barnyard there and call
kip kip kip Thats the way my wife used He stopped in a little
embarrassment

Id be glad if I could do everything as she did said Alida gently
It has grown clearer every day how hard her loss was to you If
youll tell me what she did and how she did things and she hesitated

Thats good of you Alida he replied gratefully Then with his
directness of speech he added I believe some women are inclined to
be jealous even of the dead

You need never fear to speak of your wife to me I respect and honor
your feelingsthe way you remember her Theres no reason why it
should be otherwise I did not agree to one thing and expect another
and she looked him straight in the eyes

He dropped them as he stood leaning against the bin in the shadowy old
barn and said I didnt think you or anyone would be so sensible Of
course one cant forget quickly

You oughtnt to forget was the firm reply Why should you I
should be sorry to think you could forget

I fear Im not like to make you sorry he replied sighing To tell
you the truth he added looking at her almost commiseratingly and
then he hesitated

Well the truth is usually best she said quietly

Well Ill tell you my thought We married in haste we were almost
strangers and your mind was so distracted at the time that I couldnt
blame you if you forgot whatwhat I said I fearedwell you are
carrying out our agreement so sensibly that I want to thank you Its
a relief to find that youre not opposed even in your heart that I
should remember one that I knew as a little child and married when I
was young

I remember all you said and what I said she replied with the same
direct honest gaze Dont let such thoughts trouble you any more
Youve been kinder and more considerate than I ever expected You have
only to tell me how she did

No Alida he said quietly obeying a subtle impulse Id rather you
would do everything your own wayas its natural for you There
weve talked so long that its too late to feed the chickens tonight
You can begin in the morning

Oh she cried and you have all your other work to do Ive
hindered rather than helped you by coming out

No he replied decidedly youve helped me Ill be in before very
long

She returned to the house and busied herself in preparations for
supper She was very thoughtful and at last concluded Yes he is
right I understand Although I may do WHAT his wife did he dont
wish me to do it AS she did There could only be a partial and painful
resemblance to his eyes Both he and I would suffer in comparisons
and he be continually reminded of his loss She was his wife in
reality and all relating to her is something sacred and past to him
The less I am like her the better He married me for the sake of his
farm and I can best satisfy him by carrying out his purpose in my own
way Hes through with sentiment and has taken the kindest way he
could to tell me that Ive nothing to do with his past He feared
yes he FEARED I should forget our businesslike agreement I didnt
know I had given him cause to fear I certainly wont hereafter and
the wife felt with a trace of bitterness and shame that she had been
put on her guard that her husband had wished to remind her that she
must not forget his motive in marrying her or expect anything not in
consonance with that motive Perhaps she had been too wifelike in her
manner and therefore he had feared She was as sensitive to such a
reproach as she would have been in her girlhood

For once her intuition was at fault and she misjudged Holcroft in some
respects He did think he was through with sentiment he could not
have talked deliberately to Alida or to any other about his old life
and love and he truly felt that she had no part in that life It had
become a sad and sacred memory yet he wished to feel that he had the
right to dwell upon it as he chose In his downright sincerity he
wished her to know that he could not help dwelling on it that for him
some things were over and that he was not to blame He was profoundly
grateful to her that she had so clearly accepted the facts of his past
and of their own present relations He HAD feared it is true but she
had not realized his fears and he felt that it was her due that he
should acknowledge her straightforward carrying out of the compact made
under circumstances which might well excuse her from realizing
everything fully

Moreover direct and matter of fact as he was he had felt vaguely the
inevitable difficulties of their relationship The very word wife
might suggest to her mind an affection which he believed it was not in
his power to bestow They had agreed to give an arbitrary and unusual
meaning to their marriage and while thinking it could have no other
meaning for him his mind was haunted and he feared that hers might
be by the natural significance of the rite So far from meaning to
hint that she had been too wifelike he had meant to acknowledge her
simple and natural fulfillment of his wishes in a position far more
difficult to fill than even he imagined That she succeeded so well
was due to the fact that she entertained for him all the kind feelings
possible except the one supreme regard which under ordinary
circumstances would have accounted for the marriage The reason that
all promised to go so well in their relationship of mere mutual help
was the truth that this basis of union had satisfied their mutual need
As the farmer had hoped they had become excellent friends
supplementing each others work in a way that promised prosperity

Without the least intention on the part of either chance words had
been spoken which would not be without effect He had told her to do
everything in her own way because the moment he thought of it he knew
he liked her ways They possessed a novelty and natural grace which
interested him There are both a natural and a conventional grace and
the true lady learns to blend the one with the other so as to make a
charming manner essentially her owna manner which makes a woman a
lady the world over Alida had little more than natural grace and
refinement unmodified by society This the plain farmer could
understand and he was already awakening to an appreciation of it It
impressed him agreeably that Alida should be trim and neat while about
her work and that all her actions were entirely free from the coarse
slovenly manner the limp carriage and slatternly aspect of the whole
tribe which had come and gone during the past year They had all been
so much alike in possessing disagreeable traits that he felt that Alida
was the only peculiar one among them He never thought of instituting
comparisons between her and his former wife yet he did so
unconsciously Mrs Holcroft had been too much like himself matter of
fact materialistic kind and good Devoid of imagination uneducated
in mind her thoughts had not ranged far from what she touched and saw
She touched them with something of their own heaviness she saw them as
objectsjust what they wereand was incapable of obtaining from them
much suggestion or enjoyment She knew when the cherry and plum trees
were in blossom just as she knew it was April The beautiful sounds
and changes in nature reminded her that it was time to do certain kinds
of work and with her work was alpha and omega As her mother had
before her she was inclined to be a house drudge rather than a
housewife Thrift neatness order marked the limits of her endeavor
and she accomplished her tasks with the awkward brisk directness
learned in her mothers kitchen Only mind imagination and
refinement can embroider the homely details of life Alida would learn
to do all that she had done but the woman with a finer nature would do
it in a different way Holcroft already knew he liked this way
although he could not define it to himself Tired as he was when he
came home in the evening his eyes would often kindle with pleasure at
some action or remark that interested him from its novelty In spite
of his weariness and preoccupation in spite of a still greater
obstaclethe inertia of a mind dulled by material lifehe had begun
to consider Alidas personality for its own sake He liked to watch
her not to see what she did to his advantage but how she did it She
was awakening an agreeable expectancy and he sometimes smilingly said
to himself Whats next

Oh no he thought as he was milking the last cow Id much rather
shed take her own natural way in doing things It would be easier for
her and its her right andand somehow I like her way just as I used
to like Bessies ways She isnt Bessie and never can be and for some
reason Id like her to be as different as possible

Unconsciously and unintentionally however he had given Alidas
sensitive nature a slight wound She felt that she had been told in
effect You can help me all you please and I would rather you would
do this in a way that will not awaken associations but you must not
think of me or expect me to think of you in any light that was not
agreed upon That he had feared the possibility of this that he
might have fancied he saw indications of this hurt her pridethat
pride and delicacy of feeling which most women shield so instinctively
She was now consciously on her guard and so was not so secure against
the thoughts she deprecated as before In spite of herself a
restraint would tinge her manner which he would eventually feel in a
vague uncomfortable way

But he came in at last very tired and thoroughly goodnatured Im
going to town tomorrow he said and I thought of taking a very early
start so as to save time Would you like to go

Theres no need of my going

I thought perhaps youd enjoy the drive

I would have to meet strangers and Im so entirely content in being
aloneI wont go this time unless you wish it

Well if you dont care about it Ill carry out my first plan and
take a very early start I want to sell the butter and eggs on hand
repay Tom Watterly and get some seeds We need some things from the
store too I suppose

Yes you are such a coffee drinker she began smiling

Oh I know he interrupted Make out your list You shall say what
we want Isnt there something you want for yourself

No not for myself but I do want something that perhaps you would
enjoy too You may think it a waste of money though

Well youve a right to waste some in your way as well as I have over
my pipe

Thats good I hadnt thought of that You are the one that puts
notions into my head I would like three or four geraniums and a few
flower seeds

He looked as if he was thinking deeply and she felt a little hurt that
he should not comply at once with her request knowing that the outlay
suggested was very slight

At last he looked up smiling as he said So I put notions into your
head do I

Oh well she replied flushing in the consciousness of her thoughts
if you think its foolish to spend money for such things

Tush tush Alida Of course Ill get what you wish But I really am
going to put a notion into your head and its stupid and scarcely fair
in me that I hadnt thought of some such plan before You want to take
care of the chickens Well I put them wholly in your care and you
shall have all you can make off themeggs young chickens and
everything

That IS a new notion she replied laughing I hadnt thought of
such a thing and its more than fair What would I do with so much
money

What you please Buy yourself silk dresses if you want to

But I couldnt use a quarter of the money

No matter use what you like and Ill put the rest in the bank for you
and in your name I was a nice kind of a business partner wasnt I
Expecting you to do nearly half the work and then have you say Will
you please get me a few plants and seeds and then Oh If you think
its foolish to spend money for such things Why you have as good a
right to spend some of the money you help earn as I have Youve shown
youll be sensible in spending it I dont believe youll use enough
of it Anyway it will be yours as it ought to be

Very well she replied nodding at him with piquant significance
Ill always have some to lend you

Yes shouldnt wonder if you were the richest some day Everything
you touch seems to turn out well I shall be wholly dependent on you
hereafter for eggs and an occasional fricassee

You shall have your share Yes I like this notion It grows on me
Id like to earn some money to do what I please with Youll be
surprised to see what strange and extravagant tastes Ill develop

I expect to be perfectly dumfoundered as Mrs Mumpson used to say
Since you are so willing to lend Ill lend you enough to get all you
want tomorrow Make out your list You can get a good start tomorrow
for I was too tired and it was too late for me to gather the eggs
tonight I know too that a good many of the hens have stolen their
nests of late and Ive been too busy to look for em You may find
perfect mines of eggs but for mercys sake dont climb around in
dangerous places I had such bad luck with chicks last year that Ive
only set a few hens You can set few or many now just as you please

Even as he talked and leisurely finished his supper his eyes grew
heavy with sleep What time will you start tomorrow she asked

Oh no matter long before you are up or ought to be Ill get myself
a cup of coffee I expect to do my morning work and be back by nine or
ten oclock for I wish to get in some potatoes and other vegetables
before Sunday

Very well Ill make out my list and lay it on the table here Now
why dont you go and sleep at once You ought with such an early
start in prospect

Ought I Well I never felt more inclined to do my duty You must
own up I have put one good notion into your head

I have said nothing against any of them Come you ought to go at
once

Cant I smoke my pipe first please

Youll find it quieter in the parlor

But its pleasanter here where I can watch you

Do you think I need watching

Yes a little since you dont look after your own interests very
sharply

It isnt my way to look after anything very sharply

No Alida thank the Lord Theres nothing sharp about you not even
your tongue You wont mind being left alone a few hours tomorrow

No indeed I like to be alone

I thought I did Most everyone has seemed a crowd to me Im glad
youve never given me that feeling Well goodbye till you see me
driving up with the geraniums



Chapter XXV

A Charivari

The eastern horizon was aglow with rosy tints the following morning
when Holcroft awoke the stars were but just fading from the sky and
the birds were still silent He knew by these signs that it was very
early and that he could carry out his plan of a timely start to town
Dressing very quietly he stole downstairs shoes in hand lest his
tread should awaken Alida The kitchen door leading into the hall was
closed Lifting the latch carefully he found the lamp burning the
breakfast table set and the kettle humming over a good fire This is
her work but where is she he queried in much surprise

The outer door was ajar he noiselessly crossed the room and looking
out he saw her She had been to the well for a pail of water but had
set it down and was watching the swiftly brightening east She was so
still and her face so white in the faint radiance that he had an odd
uncanny impression No woman that he had ever known would stop that
way to look at the dawn He could see nothing so peculiar in it as to
attract such fixed attention Alida he asked what do you see

She started slightly and turned to take up the pail but he had already
sprung down the steps and relieved her of the burden

Could anything be more lovely than those changing tints It seems to
me I could have stood there an hour she said quietly

You are not walking or doing all this in your sleep are you he
asked laughing yet regarding her curiously You looked as you stood
there like what people call awhats that big word

Im not a somnambulist and never was to my knowledge Youll find
Im wide enough awake to have a good breakfast soon

But I didnt expect you to get up so early I didnt wish it

Its too late now she said pleasantly so I hope you wont find
fault with me for doing what I wanted to do

Did you mean to be up and have breakfast when I told you last night

Yes Of course I didnt let you know for you would have said I
mustnt and then I couldnt It isnt good for people to get up so
early and do as much as you had on your mind without eating Now you
wont be any the worse for it

I certainly ought to be the better for so much kindly consideration
but it will cure me of such unearthly hours if you feel that you must
conform to them You look pale this morning Alida youre not strong
enough to do such things and theres no need of it when Im so used to
waiting on myself

I shall have to remind you she replied with a bright look at him
over her shoulder that you said I could do things my own way

Well it seems odd after a year when everyone who came here appeared
to grudge doing a thing for a mans comfort

I should hope I was different from them

Well you are I thought you were different from anyone I ever knew
as I saw you there looking at the east You seem wonderfully fond of
pretty things

Ill own to that But if you dont hurry you wont do as much as you
hoped by getting up early

The morning was very mild and she left the outer door open as she went
quickly to and fro with elasticity of spirit as well as step It was
pleasant to have her efforts appreciated and almost as grateful to hear
the swelling harmony of song from the awakening birds The slight
cloud that had fallen on her thoughts the evening before had lifted
She felt that she understood Holcroft better and saw that his feeling
was only that of honest friendliness and satisfaction She had merely
to recognize and respond to so much only and all would be well
Meantime she desired nothing more and he should be thoroughly
convinced of this fact She grew positively lighthearted over the
fuller assurance of the truth that although a wife she was not
expected to loveonly to be faithful to all his interests This and
this only she believed to be within her power

Holcroft departed in the serenity characteristic of ones mood when the
present is so agreeable that neither memories of the past nor
misgivings as to the future are obtrusive He met Watterly in town
and remarked This is another piece of good luck I hadnt time to go
out to your place although I meant to take time

A piece of good luck indeed Tom mentally echoed for he would have
been greatly embarrassed if Holcroft had called Mrs Watterly felt
that she had been scandalized by the marriage which had taken place in
her absence and was all the more resentful for the reason that she had
spoken to a cousin of uncertain age and still more uncertain temper in
behalf of the farmer In Mrs Watterlys estimate of action it was
either right that is in accordance with her views or else it was
intolerably wrong and without excuse Poor Tom had been made to feel
that he had not only committed an almost unpardonable sin against his
wife and her cousin but also against all the proprieties of life The
idea of such a wedding taking place in my rooms and with my husbands
sanction she had said with concentrated bitterness Then had followed
what he was accustomed to characterize as a spell of zero weather
He discreetly said nothing It didnt seem such a bad idea to me he
thought but then I suppose women folks know best about such things

He was too frank in his nature to conceal from Holcroft his misgivings
or his wifes scornful and indignant disapproval Sorry Angy feels so
bad about it Jim he said ruefully but she says I mustnt buy
anything more of you

Or have anything more to do with me I suppose

Oh come now You know a mans got to let his womenfolks have their
say about household matters but that dont make any difference in my
feelings toward you

Well well Tom If it did I should be slow to quarrel with a man
who had done me as good a turn as you have Thank the Lord Ive got
a wife thatll let me have some say about household and all other
matters You too are inclined to think that Im in an awful scrape
I feel less like getting out of it every day My wife is as
respectable as I am and a good sight better than I am If Im no
longer respectable for having married her I certainly am better
contented than I ever expected to be again I want it understood
though that the man who says anything against my wife may have to get
me arrested for assault and battery

When it comes to that Jim replied Watterly who was meek only in
the presence of his wife Id just as lief speak against her as wink
if there was anything to say But I say now as I said to you at
first she aint one of the common sort I thought well of her at
first and I think better of her now since shes doing so well by you
But I suppose marrying a woman situated as she was isnt according to
regulation We men are apt to act like the boys we used to be and go
for what we want without thinking of the consequences

Its the consequences that please me most If you had been dependent
on Mumpson Malonys and Wigginses for your home comfort you wouldnt
worry about the talk of people whod never raise a finger for you
Well goodbye Im in a hurry Your hearts in the right place Tom
and some day youll come out and take dinner with me One dinner such
as shell give you will bring you round One of our steady dishes is
a bunch of flowers and I enjoy em too What do you think of that for
a hardheaded old fellow like me

Some men are chilled by public disapproval and waver under it but
Holcroft was thereby only the more strongly confirmed in his course
Alida had won his esteem as well as his good will and it was the
instinct of his manhood to protect and champion her He bought twice
as many flowers and seeds as she had asked for and also selected two
simple flower vases then started on his return with the feeling that
he had a home

Alida entered upon her duties to the poultry with almost the pleasure
of a child She first fed them then explored every accessible nook
and hiding place in the barn and outbuildings It was evident that
many of the biddies had stolen their nests and some were brooding upon
them with no disposition to be disturbed Out of the hundred or more
fowls on the place a good many were clucking their maternal instincts
and their new keeper resolved to put eggs under all except the flighty
ones that left their nests within two or three days trial As the
result of her search the empty egg basket was in a fair way to be full
again very soon She gloated over her spoils as she smilingly assured
herself I shall take him at his word I shall spend nearly all I
make this year in fixing up the old house within and without so hell
scarcely know it

It was eleven oclock before Holcroft drove to the door with the
flowers and he was amply repaid by her pleasure in receiving them
Why I only expected geraniums she said and youve bought half a
dozen other kinds

And I expected to get my own coffee this morning and a good breakfast
was given me instead so we are quits

Youre probably ready for your dinner now if it is an hour earlier
than usual It will be ready in ten minutes

Famous That will give me a good long afternoon I say Alida when
do you want the flower beds made

No hurry about them I shall keep the plants in the window for a week
or two It isnt safe to put them outdoors before the last of May
Ill have some slips ready by that time

Yes I know Youll soon have enough to set out an acre

The days of another week passed quietly and rapidly away Alida
becoming almost as much absorbed in her interests as he in his Every
hour added to the beauty of the season without The unplowed fields
were taking on a vivid green and Holcroft said that on the following
Monday the cows should go out to pasture Wholesome agreeable
occupation enabled Alida to put away sad thoughts and memories Nature
and pleasant work are two potent healers and she was rallying fast
under their ministry Holcroft would have been blind indeed had he not
observed changes for the better Her thin cheeks were becoming fuller
and her exertions with the increasing warmth of the season often
flushed her face with a charming color The old sad and troubled
expression was passing away from her blue eyes Every day it seemed
easier for her to laugh and her step grew more elastic It was all so
gradual that he never questioned it but his eyes followed her with
increasing pleasure and he listened when she spoke with deepening
interest Sundays had been long and rather dreary days but now he
positively welcomed their coming and looked forward to the hours when
instead of brooding over the past he should listen to her pleasant
voice reading his few and neglected books There was a new atmosphere
in his homea new influence under which his mind was awakening in
spite of his weariness and absorption in the interests of the farm
Alida was always ready to talk about these and her questions would
soon enable her to talk understandingly She displayed ignorance
enough and this amused him but her queries evinced no stupidity In
reading to her father and in the cultivation of flowers she had
obtained hints of vital horticultural principles and Holcroft said to
her laughingly one evening at supper Youll soon learn all I know and
begin to teach me

Her manner of deprecating such remarks was to exaggerate them and she
replied Yes next week you will sell my eggs and I shall subscribe
for the agricultural paper my father used to take Then will begin all
the improvements of bookfarming I shall advise you to sow oats in
June plant corn in March and show you generally that all your
experience counts for nothing

This kind of badinage was new to the farmer and it amused him
immensely He did not grow sleepy so early in the evening and as he
was driving his work prosperously he shortened his hours of labor
slightly She also found time to read the county paper and gossip a
little about the news thus making a beginning in putting him and
herself en rapport with other interests than those which centered in
the farm In brief she had an active intelligent mind and a
companionable nature Her boundless gratitude for her home which
daily grew more homelike led her to employ all her tact in adding to
his enjoyment Yet so fine was her tact that her manner was a simple
embodiment of good will and he was made to feel that it was nothing
more

While all was passing so genially and satisfactorily to Holcroft it
may well be supposed that his conduct was not at all to the mind of his
neighbors News especially during the busy spring season permeates a
country neighborhood slowly The fact of his marriage had soon become
known and eventually through Justice Harkins the circumstances
relating to it and something of Alidas previous history in a garbled
form came to be discussed at rural firesides The majority of the men
laughed and shrugged their shoulders implying it was none of their
business but not a few among whom was Lemuel Weeks held up their
hands and spoke of the event in terms of the severest reprehension
Many of the farmers wives and their maiden sisters were quite as much
scandalized as Mrs Watterly had been that an unknown woman of whom
strange stories were told should have been brought into the community
from the poorhouse and after such a heathenish marriage too they
said It was irregular unprecedented and therefore utterly wrong and
subversive of the morals of the town

They longed to ostracize poor Alida yet saw no chance of doing so
They could only talk and talk they did in a way that would have made
her ears tingle had she heard

The young men and older boys however believed that they could do more
than talk Timothy Weeks had said to a group of his familiars Lets
give old Holcroft and his poorhouse bride a skimelton that will let em
know what folks think of em

The scheme found favor at once and Tim Weeks was soon recognized as
organizer and leader of the peculiar style of serenade contemplated
After his days work was over he rode here and there summoning
congenial spirits The project soon became pretty well known in
several families but the elder members remained discreetly blind and
deaf proposing to wink at what was going on yet take no compromising
part themselves Lemuel Weeks winked very knowingly and suggestively
He kept within such bounds however as would enable him to swear that
he knew nothing and had said nothing but his son had never felt more
assured of his fathers sympathy When at last the motley gathering
rendezvoused at Tims house Weeks senior was conveniently making a
call on a near neighbor

It was Saturday evening and the young May moon would furnish
sufficient light without revealing identity too clearly About a score
of young fellows and hired farmhands of the ruder sort came riding and
trudging to Weeks barn where there was a barrel of cider on tap
Here they blackened their faces with charcoal and stimulated their
courage for it was well known that Holcroft was anything but lamblike
when angered

Hell be like a bull in a china shop remarked Tim but then theres
enough of us to handle him if he gets too obstreprous

Armed with tin pans and horns which were to furnish the accompaniment
to their discordant voices they started about eight in the evening
As they moved up the road there was a good deal of coarse jesting and
bravado but when they approached the farmhouse silence was enjoined
After passing up the lane they looked rather nervously at the quiet
dwelling softly outlined in the moonlight A lamp illumined the
kitchen window and Tim Weeks whispered excitedly Hes there Lets
first peek in the window and then give em a scorcher

Knowing that they should have the coming day in which to rest Holcroft
and Alida had busied themselves with outdoor matters until late She
had been planning her flower beds cutting out the dead wood from some
neglected rosebushes and shrubbery and had also helped her husband by
sowing seed in the kitchen garden back of the house Then weary yet
pleased with the labor accomplished they made a very leisurely supper
talking over garden matters and farm prospects in general Alida had
all her flower seeds on the table beside her and she gloated over them
and expatiated on the kind of blossoms they would produce with so much
zest that Holcroft laughingly remarked I never thought that flowers
would be one of the most important crops on the place

You will think so some day I can see from the expression of your
eyes that the cherry blossoms and now the apple blows which I put on
the table please you almost as much as the fruit would

Well its because I notice em I never seemed to notice em much
before

Oh no Its more than that she replied shaking her head Some
people would notice them yet never see how pretty they were

Then theyd be blind as moles

The worst kind of blindness is that of the mind

Well I think many country people are as stupid and blind as oxen and
I was one of em Ive seen more cherry and apple blossoms this year
than in all my life before and I havent thought only of cherries and
apples either

The habit of seeing what is pretty grows on one she resumed It
seems to me that flowers and such things feed mind and heart So if one
HAS mind and heart flowers become one of the most useful crops Isnt
that practical common sense

Not very common in Oakville Im glad you think Im in a hopeful
frame of mind as they used to say down at the meeting house Anyhow
since you wish it we will have a flower crop as well as a potato crop

Thus they continued chatting while Alida cleared up the table and
Holcroft having lighted his pipe busied himself with peeling a long
slim hickory sapling intended for a whipstock

Having finished her tasks Alida was finally drying her hands on a
towel that hung near a window Suddenly she caught sight of a dark
face peering in Her startled cry brought Holcroft hastily to his feet
Whats the matter he asked

I saw Then she hesitated from a fear that he would rush into some
unknown danger

The rough crew without perceived that their presence was known and Tim
Weeks cried Now all together

A frightful overture began at once the hooting and yelling almost
drowning the instrumental part and sending to Alidas heart that awful
chill of fear produced by human voices in any moblike assemblage
Holcroft understood the affair at once for he was familiar with the
custom but she did not He threw open the door with the purpose of
sternly expostulating with the disturbers of the peace and of
threatening them with the law unless they retired With an instinct to
share his danger she stepped to his side and this brought a yell of
derision Lurid thoughts swept through her mind She had brought this
danger Her story had become known What might they not do to
Holcroft Under the impulse of vague terror and complete
selfsacrifice she stepped forward and cried I only am to blame I
will go away forever if you will spare But again the scornful clamor
rose and drowned her voice

Her action and words had been so swift that Holcroft could not
interfere but in an instant he was at her side his arm around her
his square jaw set and his eyes blazing with his kindling anger He
was not one of those men who fume early under provocation and in words
chiefly His manner and gesture were so impressive that his tormentors
paused to listen

I know he said quietly all about this old rude customthat its
often little more than a rough lark Well now that youve had it
leave at once Im in no mood for such attention from my neighbors
This is my wife and Ill break any mans head who says a word to hurt
her feelings

Oh yes Take care of her feelings now its your turn They must a
been hurt before piped up Tim Weeks

Good for you old man for showin us your poorhouse bride said
another

We dont fancy such grasswidders and much married halfmarried
women in Oakville yelled a third

Why didnt yer jump over a broomstick for a weddin ceremony someone
else bawled

These insults were fired almost in a volley Alida felt Holcrofts arm
grow rigid for a second Go in quick he said

Then she saw him seize the hickory sapling he had leaned against the
house and burst upon the group like a thunderbolt Cries of pain
yells and oaths of rage rose above the rain of blows The older
members of the crew sought to close upon him but he sprung back and
the tough sapling swept about him like a circle of light It was a
terrific weapon in the hands of a strong man now possessed of almost
giant strength in his rage More than one fellow went down under its
stinging cut and heads and faces were bleeding The younger portion
of the crowd speedily took to their heels and soon even the most
stubborn fled the farmer vigorously assisting their ignominious
retreat with tremendous downward blows on any within reach Tim Weeks
had managed to keep out of the way till they entered the lane then
taking a small stone from the fence he hurled it at their pursuer and
attempted to jump over the wall This was old and gave way under him
in such a way that he fell on the other side Holcroft leaped the
fence with a bound but Tim lying on his back shrieked and held up
his hands You wont hit a feller when hes down

No said Holcroft arresting his hickory Ill send you to jail Tim
Weeks That stone you fired cut my head Was your father in that
crowd

Nooo blubbered Tim

If he was Id follow him home and whip him in his own house Now
clear out and tell the rest of your rowdy crew that Ill shoot the
first one of you that disturbs me again Ill send the constable for
you and maybe for some of the others

Dire was the dismay and dreadful the groaning in Oakville that night
Never before had salves and poultices been in such demand Not a few
would be disfigured for weeks and wherever Holcrofts blows had fallen
welts arose like whipcords In Lemuel Weeks dwelling the
consternation reached its climax Tim bruised from his fall limped
in and told his portentous story In his spite he added I dont
care I hit him hard His face was all bloody

All bloody groaned his father Lord a mercy He can send you to
jail sure enough

Then Mrs Weeks sat down and wailed aloud



Chapter XXVI

You Dont Know

As Timothy Weeks limped hastily away Holcroft with a strong revulsion
of feeling thought of Alida HE had been able to answer insults in a
way eminently satisfactory to himself and every blow had relieved his
electrical condition But how about the poor woman who had received
worse blows than he had inflicted As he hastened toward the house he
recalled a dim impression of seeing her sink down on the doorstep
Then he remembered her effort to face the marauders alone She said
she was to blame poor child As if there were any blame at all She
said spare him as if I was facing a band of murderers instead of a
lot of neighborhood scamps and that shed go away Id fight all
Oakvillemen women and childrenbefore Id permit that and he
started on a run

He found Alida on the step where she had sunk as if struck down by the
rough epithets hurled at her She was sobbing violently almost
hysterically and at first could not reply to his soothing words He
lifted her up and half carried her within to a chair Oh oh she
cried why did I not realize it more fully before Selfish woman that
I was to marry you and bring on you all this shame and danger I
should have thought of it all I ought to have died rather than do you
such a wrong

Alida Alida protested Holcroft if it were all to do over again
Id be a thousand times more

Oh I know I know You are brave and generous and honest I saw
that much when you first spoke to me I yielded to the temptation to
secure such a friend I was too cowardly to face the world alone And
now see whats happened Youre in danger and disgrace on my account
I must go awayI must do what I should have done at first and with
her face buried in her hands she rocked back and forth overwhelmed by
the bitterness and reproach of her thoughts

Alida he urged please be calm and sensible Let me reason with
you and tell you the truth All thats happened is that the Oakville
cubs have received a welldeserved whipping When you get calm I can
explain everything so it wont seem half so bad Neither you nor I are
in any danger and as for your going away look me in the eyes and
listen

His words were almost stern in their earnestness She raised her
streaming eyes to his face then sprung up exclaiming Oh Youre
wounded

Whats that compared with your talk of going away

All explanations and reassurances would have been trivial in effect
compared with the truth that he had been hurt in her defense She
dashed her tears right and left ran for a basin of water and making
him take her chair began washing away the blood stains

Thunder he said laughing How quickly weve changed places

Oh oh she moaned Its a terrible wound it might have killed you
and they WILL kill you yet

He took her hands and held them firmly Alida he said gravely yet
kindly be still and listen to me

For a moment or two longer her bosom heaved with convulsive sobs and
then she grew quiet Dont you know you cant go away he asked
still retaining her hands and looking in her face

I could for your sake she began

No it wouldnt be for my sake I dont wish you to go and wouldnt
let you If you should let the Oakville rabble drive you away I WOULD
be in danger and so would others for Id be worse on em than an
earthquake After the lesson theyve had tonight theyll let us alone
and Ill let them alone You know Ive tried to be honest with you
from the first Believe me then the troubles over unless we make
more for ourselves Now promise youll do as I say and let me manage

Ill try she breathed softly

No no That wont do Im beginning to find you out You may get
some foolish selfsacrificing notion in your head that it would be
best for me when it would be my ruination Will you promise

Yes

Famous Now you can bathe my head all you please for it feels a
little queer

Its an awful wound she said in tones of the deepest sympathy Oh
Im so sorry

Pshaw My head is too hard for that little scamp of a Weeks to break
His turnll come next

She cut away the bloodclotted hair and bound up the rather severe
scalp wound with a tenderness and sympathy that expressed itself even
in her touch She was too confused and excited to be conscious of
herself but she had received some tremendously strong impressions
Chief among them was the truth that nothing which had happened made any
difference in himthat he was still the same loyal friend standing
between her and the world she dreadedyes between her and her own
impulses toward selfsacrifice Sweetest of all was the assurance that
he did this for his own sake as well as hers These facts seemed like
a foothold in the mad torrent of feeling and shame which had been
sweeping her away She could think of little more than that she was
safesafe because he was brave and loyaland yes safe because he
wanted her and would not give her up The heart of a woman must be
callous indeed and her nature not only trivial but stony if she is not
deeply touched under circumstances like these

In spite of his laughing contempt of danger she trembled as she saw
him ready to go out again she wished to accompany him on his round of
observation but he scouted the idea although it pleased him
Standing in the door she strained her eyes and listened breathlessly
He soon returned and said Theyve all had enough We wont be
disturbed again

He saw that her nerves needed quieting and he set about the task with
such simple tact as he possessed His first step was to light his pipe
in the most nonchalant manner and then he burst out laughing Ill
hang that hickory up It has done too good service to be put to common
use again Probably you never heard of a skimelton Alida Well they
are not so uncommon in this region I suppose Ill have to own up to
taking part in one myself when I was a young chap They usually are
only rough larks and are taken goodnaturedly Im not on jesting terms
with my neighbors and they had no business to come here but I
wouldnt have made any row if they hadnt insulted you

Her head bowed very low as she faltered Theyve heard everything

He came right to her and took her hand Didnt I hear everything
before they did

Yes

Well Alida Im not only satisfied with you but Im very grateful to
you Why shouldnt I be when you are a good Christian woman I guess
Im the one to be suited not Oakville I should be as reckless as the
devil if you should go away from me Dont I act like a man whos
ready to stand up for and protect you

Yes too ready It would kill me if anything happened to you on my
account

Well the worst would happen he said firmly if we dont go right
on as weve begun If we go quietly on about our own affairs well
soon be let alone and thats all we ask

Yes yes indeed Dont worry James Ill do as you wish

Famous You never said James to me before Why havent you

I dont know she faltered with a sudden rush of color to her pale
face

Well thats my name he resumed laughing I guess its because we
are getting better acquainted

She looked up and said impetuously You dont know how a woman feels
when a man stands up for her as you did tonight

Well I know how a man feels when there is a woman so well worth
standing up for It was a lucky thing that I had nothing heavier in my
hand than that hickory All the while he was looking at her
curiously then he spoke his thought Youre a quiet little woman
Alida most times but youre capable of a thunder gust now and then

Ill try to be quiet at all times she replied with drooping eyes

Oh Im not complaining he said laughing I like the trait

He took a small pitcher and went to the dairy Returning he poured
out two glasses of milk and said Heres to your health and happiness
Alida and when I dont stand up for the woman who started out to save
me from a mob of murderers may the next thing I eat or drink choke me
You didnt know they were merely a lot of Oakville boys did you

You cant make so light of it said she They tried to close on you
and if that stone had struck you on the temple it might have killed
you They swore like pirates and looked like ruffians with their
blackened faces They certainly were not boys in appearance

Im afraid I swore too he said sadly

You had some excuse but Im sorry They would have hurt you if you
hadnt kept them off

Yes theyd probably have given me a beating People do things in hot
blood they wish they hadnt afterward I know this Oakville
roughscuff Since weve had it out and they know what to expect
theyll give me a wide berth Now go and sleep You were never safer
in your life

She did not trust herself to reply but the glance she gave him from
her tearful eyes was so eloquent with grateful feeling that he was
suddenly conscious of some unwonted sensations He again patrolled the
place and tied the dog near the barn

Its barely possible that some of these mean cusses might venture to
kindle a fire but a bark from Towser will warn em off She IS a
spirited little woman he added with a sharp change in soliloquy
Theres nothing milkandwater about her Thunder I felt like
kissing her when she looked at me so I guess that crack on my skull
has made me a little lightheaded

He lay down in his clothes so that he might rush out in case of any
alarm and he intended to keep awake Then the first thing he knew
the sun was shining in the windows

It was long before Alida slept and the burden of her thoughts
confirmed the words that she had spoken so involuntarily You dont
know how a woman feels when a man stands up for her as you did It is
the nature of her sex to adore hardy courageous manhood Beyond all
power of expression Alida felt her need of a champion and protector
She was capable of going away for his sake but she would go in terror
and despair The words that had smitten her confirmed all her old
fears of facing the world alone Then came the overpowering thought of
his loyalty and kindness of his utter and almost fierce repugnance to
the idea of her leaving him In contrast with the man who had deceived
and wronged her Holcrofts course overwhelmed her very soul with a
passion of grateful affection A new emotion unlike anything she had
ever known thrilled her heart and covered her face with blushes I
could die for him she murmured

She awoke late in the morning When at last she entered the kitchen
she stopped in deep chagrin for Holcroft had almost completed
preparations for breakfast Ha ha he laughed turn about is fair
play

Well she sighed theres no use of making excuses now

Theres no occasion for any Did you ever see such a looking case as
I am with this bandage around my head

Does it pain you she asked sympathetically

Well it does It pains like thunder

The wound needs dressing again Let me cleanse and bind it up

Yes after breakfast

No indeed now I couldnt eat my breakfast while you were suffering
so

Im more unfeeling then than you are for I could

She insisted on having her way and then tore up her handkerchief to
supply a soft linen bandage

Youre extravagant Alida but she only shook her head

Famous That feels better What a touch you have Now if you had a
broken head my fingers would be like a pair of tongs

She only shook her head and smiled

Youre as bad as Jane used to be She never said a word when she
could shake or nod her meaning

I should think you would be glad after having been half talked to
death by her mother

As I said before take your own way of doing things It seems the
right way after it is done

A faint color came into her face and she looked positively happy as
she sat down to breakfast Are you sure your head feels better she
asked

Yes and you look a hundred per cent better Well I AM glad you had
such a good sleep after all the hubbub

I didnt sleep till toward morning she said with downcast eyes

Pshaw Thats too bad Well no matter you look like a different
person from what you did when I first saw you Youve been growing
younger every day

Her face flushed like a girls under his direct admiring gaze making
her all the more pretty She hastened to divert direct attention from
herself by asking You havent heard from anyone this morning

No but I guess the doctor has Some of those fellows will have to
keep shady for a while

As they were finishing breakfast Holcroft looked out of the open
kitchen door and exclaimed By thunder Were going to hear from some
of them now Here comes Mrs Weeks the mother of the fellow who hit
me

Wont you please receive her in the parlor

Yes she wont stay long you may be sure Im going to give that
Weeks tribe one lesson and pay off the whole score

He merely bowed coldly to Mrs Weeks salutation and offered her a
chair The poor woman took out her handkerchief and began to mop her
eyes but Holcroft was steeled against her not so much on account of
the wound inflicted by her son as for the reason that he saw in her an
accomplice with her husband in the fraud of Mrs Mumpson

I hope youre not badly hurt she began

It might be worse

Oh Mr Holcroft she broke out sobbingly spare my son It would
kill me if you sent him to prison

He took the chance of killing me last night was the cold reply
Whats far worse he insulted my wife

Oh Mr Holcroft He was young and foolish he didnt realize

Were you and your husband young and foolish he interrupted bitterly
when you gulled me into employing that crazy cousin of yours

This retort was so overwhelming that Mrs Weeks sobbed speechlessly

Alida could not help overhearing the conversation and she now glided
into the room and stood by her husbands side

James she said wont you do me a favor a great kindness

Mrs Weeks raised her eyes and looked wonderingly at this dreadful
woman against whom all Oakville was talking

I know what you wish Alida he replied sternly but I cant do it
This is a case for justice This womans son was the leader of that
vile crowd that insulted you last night I can forgive his injuring
me but not the words he used about you Moreover when I was alone
and struggling to keep my home Mrs Weeks took part with her husband
in imposing on me their fraud of a cousin and in tricking me out of
honest money Any woman with a heart in her breast would have tried to
help a man situated as I was No its a clear case of justice and
her son shall go to jail

Mrs Weeks wailed afresh at this final sentence Holcroft was amazed
to see his wife drop on her knees beside his chair He raised her
instantly Dont do such a thing as that he said huskily

Without removing her pleading eyes from his face she asked gently Who
told us to forgive as we would be forgiven James I shall be very
unhappy if you dont grant this mothers prayer

He tried to turn away but she caught his hand and held his eyes with
hers Alida he said in strong agitation you heard the vile false
words that Timothy Weeks said last night They struck you down like a
blow Can you forgive him

Yes and I plead with you to forgive him Grant me my wish James I
shall be so much happier and so will you

Well Mrs Weeks now you know what kind of a woman your son came to
insult You may tell your neighbors that theres one Christian in
Oakville I yield to Mrs Holcroft and will take no further action in
the affair if we are let alone

Mrs Weeks was not a bad woman at heart and she had received a
wholesome lesson She came and took Alidas hand as she said Yes
you are a Christiana better woman than Ive been but I aint so mean
and bad but what when I see my fault I am sorry and can ask
forgiveness I do ask your forgiveness Mr Holcroft Ive been
ashamed of myself ever since you brought my cousin back I thought she
would try when she had the chance you gave her but she seems to have
no sense

There there Let bygones be bygones said the farmer in
embarrassment Ive surrendered Please dont say anything more

Youve got a kind heart in spite

Oh come now Please quit or Ill begin to swear a little to keep up
the reputation my neighbors have given me Go home and tell Tim to
brace up and try to be a man When I say Im done with a grudge I AM
done You and Mrs Holcroft can talk all you like but please excuse
me and with more than most mens horror of a scene he escaped
precipitately

Sit down Mrs Weeks said Alida kindly

Well I will I cant say much to excuse myself or my folks

Youve already said everything Mrs Weeks interrupted Alida gently
youve said you are sorry

Mrs Weeks stared a moment and then resumed sententiously Well Ive
heard more gospel in that remark than if Id gone to church And I
couldnt go to church I could never have gone there again or held my
head up anywhere ifif

Thats all past and gone said Alida smiling When Mr Holcroft
says anything you may depend on it

Well God bless you for intercedinyou had so much to forgive
Nobody shall ever speak a word against you again while Ive got breath
to answer I wish youd let me come and see you sometimes

Whenever you wish if you care to visit one who has had so muchso
much trouble

I see now thats all the more reason I should come for if it hadnt
been for you Id have been in bitter trouble myself Weve been worse
than heathen standin off and talking against you Oh Ive had a
lesson I wont forget Well I must hurry home for I left Timothy and
Lemuel in a dreadful state

Seeing the farmer in the barn as she was passing she rushed to him
Youve got to shake hands with me Mr Holcroft Your wife IS a good
woman and shes a lady too Anyone with half an eye can see shes
not one of the common sort

The farmer shook the poor womans hand goodnaturedly and said
heartily Thats so All right meetings over Goodbye Then he
turned to his work and chuckled Thats what Tom Watterly said Thank
the Lord She ISNT of the common sort Ive got to brace up and be
more of a man as well as Tim Weeks

In spite of the pain in his head Alidas words proved true He was
happier than he had been in many a long day He had the glow which
follows a generous act and the thought that he had pleased a sweet
little woman who somehow seemed very attractive to him that May
morning at the same time the old Adam in his nature led to a sneaking
satisfaction that he had laid on the hickory so unsparingly the evening
before

Alida uttered a low happy laugh as she heard him whistling
Coronation in jig time and she hustled away the breakfast things
with the eagerness of a girl that she might be ready to read to him
when he came in



Chapter XXVII

Farm and Farmer Bewitched

The day grew warm and having finished her tasks indoors and cared for
the poultry Alida brought a chair out in the porch Her eyes were
dreamy with a vague undefined happiness The landscape in itself was
cause for exquisite pleasure for it was an ideal day of the
appleblossoming period The old orchard back of the barn looked as if
pinkandwhite clouds had settled upon it and scattered trees near and
far were exhaling their fragrance The light breeze which fanned her
cheek and bent the growing rye in an adjacent field was perfumed beyond
the skill of art Not only were her favorite meadow larks calling to
each other but the thrushes had come and she felt that she had never
heard such hymns as they were singing A burst of song from the lilac
bush under the parlor window drew her eyes thither and there was the
paternal redbreast pouring out the very soul of ecstasy From the nest
beneath him rose the black head and yellow beak of his brooding mate
How contented and happy she looks Alida murmured how happy they
both are And the secret of it is HOME And to think that I who was
a friendless waif am at home also At home with Edenlike beauty and
peace before my eyes But if it hadnt been for him and if he were
not brave kind and true to all he says and she shuddered at a
contrast that rose before her fancy

She could now scarcely satisfy herself that it was only gratitude which
filled her heart with a strange happy tumult She had never been
conscious of such exaltation before It is true she had learned to
cherish a strong affection for the man whom she had believed to be her
husband but chiefly because he had seemed kind and she had an
affectionate disposition Until within the last few hours her nature
had never been touched and awakened in its profoundest depths She had
never known before nor had she idealized the manhood capable of evoking
the feelings which now lighted her eyes and gave to her face the
supreme charm and beauty of womanhood In truth it was a fitting day
and time for the birth of a love like hers simple allabsorbing and
grateful It contained no element not in harmony with that May Sunday
morning

Holcroft came and sat on the steps below her She kept her eyes on the
landscape for she was consciously enough on her guard now I rather
guess you think Alida that you are looking at a better picture than
any artist fellow could paint he remarked

Yes she replied hesitatingly and the picture seems all the more
lovely and full of light because the background is so very dark Ive
been thinking of what happened here last night and what might have
happened and how I felt then

You feel betterdifferent now dont you You certainly look so

YesYou made me very happy by yielding to Mrs Weeks

Oh I didnt yield to her at all

Very well have it your own way then

I think you had it your way

Are you sorry

Do I look so How did you know Id be happier if I gave in

Because as you say Im getting better acquainted with you YOU
couldnt help being happier for a generous act

I wouldnt have done it though if it hadnt been for you

Im not so sure about that

I am Youre coming to make me feel confoundedly uncomfortable in my
heathenish life

I wish I could

I never had such a sermon in my life as you gave me this morning A
Christian act like yours is worth a year of religious talk

She looked at him wistfully for a moment and then asked a little
abruptly Mr Holcroft have you truly forgiven that Weeks family

Oh yes I suppose so Ive forgiven the old lady anyhow Ive
shaken hands with her

If her husband and son should come and apologize and say they were
sorry would you truly and honestly forgive them

Certainly I couldnt hold a grudge after that What are you aiming
at and he turned and looked inquiringly into her face

It was flushed and tearful in its eager earnest interest Dont you
see she faltered

He shook his head but was suddenly and strangely moved by her
expression

Why Mr Holcroft if you can honestly forgive those who have wronged
you you ought to see how ready God is to forgive

He fairly started to his feet so vividly the truth came home to him
illumined as it was by a recent and personal experience After a
moment he slowly sat down again and said with a long breath That
was a close shot Alida

I only wish you to have the trust and comfort which this truth should
bring you she said It seems a pity you should do yourself needless
injustice when you are willing to do what is right and kind by others

Its all a terrible muddle Alida If God is so ready to forgive how
do you account for all the evil and suffering in the world

I dont account for it and cant Im only one of his little
children often an erring one too Youve been able to forgive grown
people your equals and strangers in a sense Suppose you had a
little boy that had done wrong but said he was sorry would you hold a
grudge against him

The idea Id be a brute

She laughed softly as she asked again dont you see

He sat looking thoughtfully away across the fields for a long time and
finally asked Is your idea of becoming a Christian just being
forgiven like a child and then trying to do right

Yes Why not

Well he remarked with a grim laugh I didnt expect to be cornered
in this way

You who are truthful should face the truth It would make you
happier A good deal that was unexpected has happened When I look
out on a scene like this and think that I am safe and at home I feel
that God has been very good to me and that you have too I cant bear
to think that you have that old trouble on your mindthe feeling that
you had been a Christian once but was not one now Being sure that
there is no need of your continuing to feel so what sort of return
would I be making for all your kindness if I did not try to show you
what is as clear to me as this sunshine

You are a good woman Alida Believing as you do you have done right
to speak to me and I never believed mortal lips could speak so to the
purpose I shall think of what you have said for you have put things
in a new light But say Alida what on earth possesses you to call me
Mr You dont need to be scared half to death every time to call me
by my first name do you

Scared Oh no She was a trifle confused he thought but then her
tone was completely reassuring

The day was one long remembered by both As in nature about them the
conditions of development and rapid change now existed

She did not read aloud very much and long silences fell between them
They were reaching a higher plane of companionship in which words are
not always essential Both had much to think about and their thoughts
were like roots which prepare for blossom and fruit

With Monday busy life was resumed The farmer began planting his corn
and Alida her flower seeds Almost every day now added to the brood of
little chicks under her care The cows went out to pasture Holcroft
brought in an increasing number of overflowing pails of milk and if
the labors of the dairy grew more exacting they also grew more
profitable The tide had turned income was larger than outgo and it
truly seemed to the longharassed man that an era of peace and
prosperity had set in

To a superficial observer things might have appeared to be going on
much as before but there were influences at work which Holcroft did
not clearly comprehend

As Alida had promised herself she spent all the money which the eggs
brought in but Holcroft found pretty muslin curtains at the parlor
windows and shades which excluded the glare from the kitchen Better
china took the place of that which was cracked and unsightly In
brief a subtle and refining touch was apparent all over the house

How fine we are getting he remarked one evening at supper

Ive only made a beginning she replied nodding defiantly at him
The chickens will paint the house before the year is over

Phew When do the silk dresses come in

When your broadcloth does

Well if this goes on I shall certainly have to wear purple and fine
linen to keep pace

Fine linen certainly When you take the next lot of eggs to town I
shall tell you just the number of yards I need to make half a dozen
extra fine shirts Those you have are getting past mending

Do you think Ill let you spend your money in that way

Youll let me spend MY money just as I pleasein the way that will do
me the most good

What a saucy little woman you are becoming he said looking at her
so fondly that she quickly averted her eyes Its a way people fall
into when humored she answered

See here Alida youre up to some magic It seems but the other day
I brought you here a pale ghost of a woman As old Jonathan Johnson
said you were enjyin poor health Do you know what he said when I
took him off so he wouldnt put you through the catechism

No she replied with a deprecating smile and rising color

He said he was afeared Id been taken in you were such a sickly
lookin critter Ha Ha Wish he might see you now with that
flushed face of yours I never believed in magic but Ill have to
come to it You are bewitched and are being transformed into a pretty
young girl right under my eyes the house is bewitched and is growing
pretty too and pleasanter all the time The cherry and apple trees
are bewitched for they never blossomed so before the hens are
bewitched they lay as if possessed the

Oh stop Or I shall think that youre bewitched yourself

I truly begin to think I am

Oh well Since we all and everything are affected in the same way
it dont matter

But it does Its unaccountable Im beginning to rub my eyes and
pinch myself to wake up

If you like it I wouldnt wake up

Suppose I did and saw Mrs Mumpson sitting where you do Jane here
and Mrs Wiggins smoking her pipe in the corner The very thought
makes me shiver My first words would be Please pass the cold
pison

What nonsense you are talking tonight she tried to say severely but
the pleased happy look in her eyes betrayed her He regarded her with
the open admiration of a boy and she sought to divert his attention by
asking What do you think has become of Jane

I dont knowstealing around like a strange cat in some relations
house I suppose

You once said you would like to do something for her

Well I would If I could afford it Id like to send her to school

Would you like her to come here and study lessons part of the time

He shivered visibly No Alida and you wouldnt either Shed make
you more nervous than she would me and thats saying a good deal I
do feel very sorry for her and if Mrs Weeks comes to see you well
find out if something cant be done but her presence would spoil all
our cozy comfort The fact is I wouldnt enjoy having anyone here
You and I are just about company enough Still if you feel that youd
like to have some help

Oh no I havent enough to do

But youre always adoing Well if youre content I havent
Christian fortitude enough to make any changes

She smiled and thought that she was more than content She had begun
to detect symptoms in her husband which her own heart enabled her to
interpret In brief it looked as if he were drifting on a smooth
swift tide to the same haven in which she was anchored

One unusually warm morning for the season rain set in after breakfast
Holcroft did not fret in the least that he could not go to the fields
nor did he as had been his custom at first find rainyday work at the
barn The cows in cropping the lush grass had so increased their
yield of milk that it was necessary to churn every other day and Alida
was busy in the dairy This place had become inviting by reason of its
coolness and she had rendered it more so by making it perfectly clean
and sweet Strange to say it contained another chair besides the one
she usually occupied The apartment was large and stoneflagged
Along one side were shelves filled with rows of shining milkpans In
one corner stood the simple machinery which the old dog put in motion
when tied upon his movable walk and the churn was near An iron pipe
buried deep in the ground brought cool spring water from the brook
above This pipe emptied its contents with a low gurgle into a shallow
oblong receptacle sunk in the floor and was wide and deep enough for
two stone crocks of ample size to stand abreast up to their rims in the
water The cream was skimmed into these stone jars until they were
full then Holcroft emptied them into the churn He had charged Alida
never to attempt this part of the work and indeed it was beyond her
strength After breakfast on churning days he prepared everything and
set the dog at work Then he emptied the churn of the buttermilk when
he came in to dinner

All the associations of the place were pleasant to Alida It was here
that her husband had shown patience as well as kindness in teaching her
how to supplement his work until her own experience and judgment gave
her a better skill than he possessed Many pleasant laughing words
had passed between them in this cool shadowy place and on a former
rainy morning he had brought a chair down that he might keep her
company She had not carried it back nor was she very greatly
surprised to see him saunter in and occupy it on the present occasion
She stood by the churn her figure outlined clearly in the light from
the open door as she poured in cold water from time to time to hasten
and harden the gathering butter Her right sleeve was rolled well
back revealing a white arm that was becoming beautifully plump and
round An artist would have said that her attitude and action were
unconsciously natural and graceful Holcroft had scarcely the remotest
idea of artistic effect but he had a sensible mans perception of a
charming woman when she is charming

Mr Holcroft she asked very gravely will you do something for me

Yes half a dozen things

You promise

Certainly Whats the trouble

I dont mean there shall be any if I can help it she answered with a
light ripple of laughter Please go and put on your coat

How youve humbugged me Its too hot

Oh youve got to do it you promised You cant stay here unless you
do

So you are going to take care of me as if I were a small boy

You need caresometimes

He soon came back and asked Now may I stay

Yes Please untie the dog Butters come

I should think it would or anything else at your coaxing

Ohh what a speech Hasnt that a pretty golden hue she asked
holding up a mass of the butter she was ladling from the churn into a
wooden tray

Yes you are making the giltedge article now I dont have to sell
it to Tom Watterly any more

Id like to give him some though

He was silent and something like sudden rage burned in his heart that
Mrs Watterly would not permit the gift That anyone should frown on
his having such a helper as Alida was proving herself to be made him
vindictive Fortunately her face was turned away and she did not see
his heavy frown Then to shield her from a disagreeable fact he said
quickly do you know that for over a year I steadily went behind my
expenses And that your butter making has turned the tide already
Im beginning to get ahead again

Im SO glad and her face was radiant

Yes I should know that from your looks Its clearer every day that
I got the best of our bargain I never dreamed though that I should
enjoy your society as I dothat we should become such very good
friends That wasnt in the bargain was it

Bargain The spirited way with which she echoed the word as if
thereby repudiating anything like a sordid side to their mutual
relations was not lost on her wondering and admiring partner She
checked herself suddenly Now let me teach YOU how to make butter
and with the tray in her lap she began washing the golden product and
pressing out the milk

He laughed in a confused delighted way at her piquant half saucy
manner as he watched her deft round arm and shapely hand

The farmers wives in Oakville would say your hands were too little to
do much

They would and she raised her blue eyes indignantly to his No
matter you are the one to say about that

I say they do too much I shall have to get Jane to help you

By all means Then youll have more society

That was a home shot You know how I dote on everybodys absence
even Janes

You dote on butter See how firm and yellow its getting You
wouldnt think it was milkwhite cream a little while ago would you
Now Ill put in the salt and you must taste it for youre a
connoisseur

A what

Judge then

You know a sight more than I do Alida

Im learning all the time

So am Ito appreciate you

Listen to the sound of the rain and the water as it runs into the
milkcooler Its like low music isnt it

Poor Holcroft could make no better answer than a sneeze

Ohh she exclaimed youre catching cold Come you must go right
upstairs You cant stay here another minute Im nearly through

I was never more contented in my life

Youve no right to worry me What would I do if you got sick Come
Ill stop work till you go

Well then little boss goodbye

With a half suppressed smile at his obedience Alida watched his
reluctant departure She kept on diligently at work but one might
have fancied that her thoughts rather than her exertions were flushing
her cheeks

It seemed to her that but a few moments elapsed before she followed
him but he had gone Then she saw that the rain had ceased and that
the clouds were breaking His cheerful whistle sounded reassuringly
from the barn and a little later he drove up the lane with a cart

She sat down in the kitchen and began sewing on the fine linen they had
jested about Before long she heard a light step Glancing up she
saw the most peculiar and uncannylooking child that had ever crossed
her vision and with dismal presentiment knew it was Jane



Chapter XXVIII

Another Waif

It was indeed poor forlorn little Jane that had appeared like a
specter in the kitchen door She was as wet and bedraggled as a
chicken caught in a shower A little felt hat hung limp over her ears
her pigtail braid had lost its string and was unraveling at the end
and her torn sodden shoes were ready to drop from her feet She
looked both curiously and apprehensively at Alida with her little
blinking eyes and then asked in a sort of breathless voice Wheres
him

Mr Holcroft

Jane nodded

Hes gone out to the fields You are Jane arent you

Another nod

Oh DEAR groaned Alida mentally I wish she hadnt come Then
with a flush of shame the thought crossed her mind She perhaps is a
friendless and homeless as I was and and him is also her only
hope Come in Jane she said kindly and tell me everything

Be you his new girl

Im his wife said Alida smiling

Jane stopped her mouth opened and her eyes twinkled with dismay Then
he is married after all she gasped

Yes why not

Mother said hed never get anyone to take him

Well you see she was mistaken

Shes wrong about everything Well its no use then and the child
turned and sat down on the doorstep

Alida was perplexed From the way Jane wiped her eyes with her wet
sleeve she was evidently crying Coming to her Alida said What is
no use Jane Why are you crying

I thoughthemightprapslet me stay and work for him

Alida was still more perplexed What could be said by way of comfort
feeling sure as she did that Holcroft would be bitterly hostile to the
idea of keeping the child The best she could do was to draw the
little waif out and obtain some explanation of her unexpected
appearance But first she asked Have you had any breakfast

Jane shook her head

Oh then you must have some right away

Dont want any I want to die I oughtn ter been born

Tell me your troubles Jane Perhaps I can help you

No youd be like the rest They all hate me and make me feel Im in
the way Hes the only one that didnt make me feel like a stray cat
and now hes gone and got married and the child sobbed aloud

Her grief was pitiful to see for it was overwhelming Alida stooped
down and gently lifting the child up brought her in Then she took
off the wet hat and wiped the tearstained face with her handkerchief
Wait a minute Jane till I bring you something and she ran to the
dairy for a glass of milk You must drink it she said kindly but
firmly

The child gulped it down and with it much of her grief for this was
unprecedented treatment and was winning her attention

Say she faltered will you ask him to let me stay

Yes Ill ask him but I cant promise that he will

You wont ask him fore my face and then tell him not to behind my
back and there was a sly keen look in her eyes which tears could not
conceal

No said Alida gravely thats not my way How did you get here
Jane

Run away

From where

Poorhouse

Alida drew a quick breath and was silent a few moments Isis your
mother there she asked at length

Yes They wouldnt let us visit round any longer

Didnt your mother or anyone know you were coming

Jane shook her head

Alida felt that it would be useless to burden the unhappy child with
misgivings as to the result and her heart softened toward her as one
who in her limited way had known the bitterness and dread which in that
same almshouse had overwhelmed her own spirit She could only say
gently Well wait till Mr Holcroft comes and then well see what he
says She herself was both curious and anxious as to his course It
will be a heavy cross she thought but I should little deserve Gods
goodness to me if I did not befriend this child

Every moment added weight to this unexpected burden of duty Apart
from all consideration of Janes peculiarities the isolation with
Holcroft had been a delight in itself Their mutual enjoyment of each
others society had been growing from day to day and she more truly
than he had shrunk from the presence of another as an unwelcome
intrusion Conscious of her secret Janes prying eyes were already
beginning to irritate her nerves Never had she seen a human face that
so completely embodied her idea of inquisitiveness as the uncanny
visage of this child She saw that she would be watched with a
tireless vigilance Her recoil however was not so much a matter of
conscious reasoning and perception as it was an instinctive feeling of
repulsion caused by the unfortunate child It was the same old story
Jane always put the women of a household on pins and needles just as
her mother exasperated the men Alida had to struggle hard during a
comparatively silent hour to fight down the hope that Holcroft would
not listen to Janes and her own request

As she stepped quickly and lightly about in her preparations for
dinner the girl watched her intently At last she gave voice to her
thoughts and said If motherd only worked round smart as you praps
shed hooked him stid er you

Alidas only reply was a slight frown for the remark suggested
disagreeable images and fancies Oh how can I endure it she sighed
She determined to let Jane plead her own cause at first thinking that
perhaps this would be the safest way If necessary she would use her
influence against a hostile decision let it cost in discomfort what it
might

At a few moments before twelve the farmer came briskly toward the
house and was evidently in the best of spirits When he entered and
saw Jane his countenance indicated so much dismay that Alida could
scarcely repress a smile The child rose and stood before him like a
culprit awaiting sentence She winked hard to keep the tears back for
there was no welcome in his manner She could not know how intensely
distasteful was her presence at this time nor had Holcroft himself
imagined how unwelcome a third person in his house could be until he
saw the intruder before him He had only felt that he was wonderfully
contented and happy in his home and that Jane would be a constant
source of annoyance and restraint Moreover it might lead to
visitation from Mrs Mumpson and that was the summing up of earthly
ills But the childs appearance and manner were so forlorn and
deprecating that words of irritation died upon his lips He gravely
shook hands with her and then drew out the story which Alida had
learned

Why Jane he exclaimed frowning Mr Watterly will be scouring the
country for you I shall have to take you back right after dinner

I kinder hoped she sobbed that youd let me stay Id stay in the
barn if I couldnt be in the house Id just as soon work outdoors
too

I dont think youd be allowed to stay said the farmer with a
sinking heart and thenperhaps your mother would be coming here

I cant stand mother no moren you can said the girl through her set
teeth I oughtnter been born for theres no place for me in the
world

Holcroft looked at his wife his face expressive of the utmost
annoyance worry and irresolution Her glance was sympathetic but
she said nothing feeling that if he could make the sacrifice from his
own will he should have the chance You cant begin to know how much
trouble this may lead to Jane he resumed You remember how your
other threatened to take the law upon me and it wouldnt be possible
for you to stay here without her consent

She oughter consent Ill make her consent cried the child speaking
as if driven to desperation Whats she ever done for me but teach me
mean ways Keep me or kill me for I must be in some place where Ive a
right to be away from mother Ive found that theres no sense in her
talk and it drives me crazy

Although Janes words and utterance were strangely uncouth they
contained a despairing echo which the farmer could not resist Turning
his troubled face to his wife he began If this is possible Alida
it will be a great deal harder on you than it will on me I dont feel
that I would be doing right by you unless you gave your consent with
full knowledge of

Then please let her stay if it is possible She seems to need a
friend and home as much as another that you heard about

Theres no chance of such a blessed reward in this case he replied
with a grim laugh Then perplexed indeed he continued to Jane Im
just as sorry for you as I can be but theres no use of getting my
wife and self in trouble which in the end will do you no good You are
too young to understand all that your staying may lead to

It wont lead to mothers comin here and thats the worst that could
happen Since she cant do anything for me shes got to let me do for
myself

Alida please come with me in the parlor a moment You stay here
Jane When they were alone he resumed Somehow I feel strangely
unwilling to have that child live with us We were enjoying our quiet
life so much Then you dont realize how uncomfortable she will make
you Alida

Yes I do

I dont think you can yet Your sympathies are touched now but
shell watch you and irritate you in a hundred ways Dont her very
presence make you uncomfortable

Yes

Well then she cant stay he began decidedly This is your home
and no one shall make you uncomfortable

But I should be a great deal more uncomfortable if she didnt stay
Alida interrupted I should feel that I did not deserve my home Not
long ago my heart was breaking because I was friendless and in trouble
What could I think of myself if I did not entreat you in behalf of this
poor child

Thunder ejaculated Holcroft I guess I was rather friendless and
troubled myself and I didnt know the world had in it such a good
friend as youve become Alida Well well Youve put it in such a
light that Id be almost tempted to take the mother also

No she replied laughing well draw the line at the mother

Well Ill take Jane to town this afternoon and if her mother will
sign an agreement to leave us all in peace well give up our old cozy
comfort of being alone I suppose it must be a good deed since its
so mighty hard to do it he concluded with a wry face leading the way
to the kitchen again She smiled as if his words were already rewarding
her self denial

Well Jane he resumed Mrs Holcroft has spoken in your behalf and
if we can arrange matters so that you can stay you will have her to
thank chiefly Ill take you back to the poorhouse after dinner so it
may be known whats become of you Then if your motherll sign an
agreement to make no trouble and not come here well give you a home
until we can find a better place for you

There was no outburst of gratitude The repressed dwarfed nature of
the child was incapable of this yet there was an unwonted little
thrill of hope in her heart Possibly it was like the beginning of
life in a seed under the first spring rays of the sun She merely
nodded to Holcroft as if the matter had been settled as far as it could
be and ignored Alida

Why dont you thank Mrs Holcroft he asked

Then Jane turned and nodded at Alida Her vocabulary of thanks was
undeveloped

Shes glad said Alida Youll see Now that its settled we hope
youre hungry Jane arent you

Yes I be Cant I help you put things on the table

Yes

Holcroft looked at the two for a moment and then shook his head as he
went up to his room I thought my wife was nice and pleasant looking
before he thought but shes like a picture beside that child
Well she has behaved handsomely Tom Watterly didnt tell half the
truth when he said she was not of the common run Shes a Christian in
deeds not talk Whats that in Scripture about I was hungry Well
well She makes religion kind of natural and plain like whether its
easy or not Thunder What a joke it is to see her so grateful
because Ive given her a chance to help me out of the worst scrape a
man could be in As if she hadnt changed everything for the better
Here I am sure of my home and getting ahead in the world again and
its all her doing

In admiration of his wife Holcroft quite forgot that there had been any
selfsacrifice on his part and he concluded that he could endure Jane
and almost anything else as long as Alida continued to look after his
comfort and interests

Now that the worst stress of Janes anxiety was over she proved that
she was half starved Indeed she had few misgivings now for her
confidence that Holcroft would accomplish what he attempted was almost
unbounded It was a rather silent meal at first for the farmer and
his wife had much to think about and Jane much to do in making up for
many limited meals At last Holcroft smiled so broadly that Alida
said Something seems to please you

Yes more than one thing It might be a great deal worse and was
not long ago I was thinking of old times

How pleasant they must have been to make you look so happy

They had their uses and make me think of a picture I saw in a store
window in town It was a picture of a woman and she took my fancy
amazingly But the point uppermost in my mind was a trick of the
fellow who painted her He had made the background as dark as night
and so she stood out as if alive and she looked so sweet and good that
I felt like shaking hands with her I now see why the painter made the
background so dark

Alida smiled mischievously as she replied That was his art He knew
that almost anyone would appear well against such a background

But Holcroft was much too direct to be diverted from his thought or its
expression The man knew the mighty nicelooking woman he had painted
would look well he said and I know of another woman who appears
better against a darker background Thats enough to make a man smile
who has been through what I have

She could not help a flush of pleasure or disguise the happy light in
her eyes but she looked significantly at Jane who mystified and
curious was glancing from one to the other

Confound it thought the farmer Thatll be the way of it now
Heres a little pitcher thats nearly all ears Well were in for it
and must do our duty

Going to town that day involved no slight inconvenience but Holcroft
dropped everything and rapidly made his preparations

When Alida was left alone with Jane the latter began clearing the
table with alacrity and after a few furtive glances at Mrs Holcroft
yielded to the feeling that she should make some acknowledgment of the
intercession in her behalf Say she began I thought you wasnt
goin to stand up for me after all Women folks are liars mostly

You are mistaken Jane If you wish to stay with us you must tell
the truth and drop all sly ways

Thats what he said when I first come

I say it too You see a good deal Jane Try to see what will please
people instead of what you can find out about them Its a much better
plan Now as a friend I tell you of one thing you had better not do
You shouldnt watch and listen to Mr Holcroft unless he speaks to you
He doesnt like to be watchedno one does It isnt nice and if you
come to us I think you will try to do what is nice Am I not right

I dunno how said Jane

It will be part of my business to teach you You ought to understand
all about your coming Mr Holcroft doesnt take you because he needs
your work but because hes sorry for you and wishes to give you a
chance to do better and learn something You must make up your mind to
lessons and learning to talk and act nicely as well as to do such
work as is given you Are you willing to do what I say and mind me
pleasantly and promptly

Jane looked askance at the speaker and was vaguely suspicious of some
trick In her previous sojourn at the farmhouse she had concluded that
it was her best policy to keep in Holcrofts good graces even though
she had to defy her mother and Mrs Wiggins and she was now by no
means ready to commit herself to this new domestic power She had
received the impression that the authority and continued residence of
females in this household was involved in much uncertainty and
although Alida was in favor now and the farmers wife she didnt know
what vicissitudes as her mother would denominate them might occur
Holcroft was the only fixed and certain quantity in her troubled
thoughts and after a little hesitation she replied Ill do what he
says Im goin to mind him

Suppose he tells you to mind me

Then I will That ud be mindin him Im goin to stick to him for
I made out by it better before than by mindin mother and Mrs Wiggins

Alida now understood the child and laughed aloud You are right she
said I wont ask you to do anything contrary to his wishes Now tell
me Jane what other clothes have you besides those you are wearing

It did not take the girl long to inventory her scanty wardrobe and
then Alida rapidly made out a list of what was needed immediately
Wait here she said and putting on a pretty straw hat one of her
recent purchases she started for the barn

Holcroft had his wagon and team almost ready when Alida joined him and
led the way to the floor between the sweetsmelling haymows

One thing leads to another she began looking at him a little
deprecatingly You must have noticed the condition of Janes clothes

She does look like a little scarecrow now I come to think of it he
admitted

Yes shes not much better off than I was Alida returned with
downcast eyes and rising color

Her flushing face was so pretty under the straw hat and the dark mow
as a background brought out her figure so finely that he thought of the
picture again and laughed aloud for pleasure She looked up in
questioning surprise thus adding a new grace

I wish that artist fellow was here now he exclaimed He could make
another picture that would suit me better than the one I saw in town

What nonsense she cried quickly averting her face from his admiring
scrutiny Come Im here to talk business and youve no time to waste
Ive made out a list of what the child actually must have to be
respectable

Youre right Alida said the farmer becoming grave at once over a
question of dollars and cents As you say one thing leads to another
and if we take the girl we must clothe her decently But then I guess
shell earn enough to pay her way It isnt that I worry about so
much he broke out discontentedly but the interference with our
quiet cozy life Things are going so smoothly and pleasantly that I
hate a change of any kind

We mustnt be selfish you know she replied You are doing a kind
generous act and I respect you all the more for it

That settles everything Youll like me a little better for it too
wont you he asked hesitatingly

She laughed outright at this question and answered It wont do to
take too much selfsacrifice out of your act Theres something which
does us all good She ought to have a spelling and a writing book
also

Holcroft was assuredly falling under the sway of the little blind god
for he began at once to misunderstand Alida You are very fond of
selfsacrifice he said rather stiffly Yes Ill get everything on
your list and he took it from her hand Now I must be off he
added for I wish to get back before night and its so warm I cant
drive fast Sorry I have to go for I cant say I dote on
selfsacrifice

Alida but partially understood his sudden change of mood nor was the
farmer much better enlightened himself in regard to his irritation He
had received an unexpected impression and it seemed to fit in with
other things and explain them She returned slowly and dejectedly to
the house leaving unsaid the words she meant to speak about Janes
relations to her Now she wished that she had imitated Jane and
merely nodded to the farmers questions If he knew how far I am
beyond the point of liking I dont know what hed do or say she
thought and I suppose thats the reason I couldnt answer him
frankly in a way that would have satisfied him Its a pity I
couldnt begin to just LIKE a little at first as he does and have
everything grow as gradually and quietly as one of his cornstalks
Thats the way I meant it should be but when he stood up for me and
defended me from those men my heart just melted and in spite of
myself I felt I could die for him It cant be such an awful thing
for a woman to fall in love with her husband and yetyet Id rather
put my hand in the fire than let him know how I feel Oh dear I
wish Jane hadnt been born as she says Trouble is beginning already
and it was all so nice before she came

In a few moments Holcroft drove up Alida stood in the door and looked
timidly at him He thought she appeared a little pale and troubled
but his bad mood prevailed and he only asked briefly Cant I get
something for you

She shook her head

Well goodbye then and he drove away with Jane who was confirmed
in her line of policy Shes afraid of im too thought the child
Mind her Guess not unless he says so She watched the farmer
furtively and concluded that she had never known him to look more grim
or be more silent even under her mothers blandishments Hes married
this one I spose to keep house for im but he dont like her
follerin im up or bein forard any moren he did mother Shouldnt
wonder if he didnt keep her either if she dont suit better She
neednt a put on such airs with me for Im goin to stick to him



Chapter XXIX

Husband and Wife in Trouble

Like many others with simple strong natures Holcroft could not be
wrongheaded moderately and his thoughts once started in a direction
were apt to carry him much farther than the cause warranted Engrossed
in painful and rather bitter musings he paid no heed to Jane and
almost forgot his errand to town I was a fool to ask that question
he thought I was getting silly and sentimental with my talk about the
picture and all that She laughed at me and reminded me I was wasting
time Of course she cant like an old hardfeatured man like me Im
beginning to understand her now She made a business marriage with me
and means to live up to her agreement Shes honest she feels Ive
done her a real kindness in giving her a home and shes willing to be
as selfsacrificing as the day is long to make it up to me I wish she
wasnt so grateful theres no occasion for it I dont want her to
feel that every pleasant word and every nice act is so much toward
paying a debt If there was any balance in my favor it was squared up
long ago and I was willing to call it even from the start Shes made
me like her for her own sake and not on account of what she does for
me and thats what I had in mind But shes my superior in every way
shes growing to be a pretty as a picture and I suppose I appear like
a rather rough customer Well I cant help if but it rather goes
against me to have her think Ive married him and Im going to do my
duty by him just as I agreed Shell do her duty by this Jane in the
same selfsacrificing spirit and will try to make it pleasant for the
child just because its right and because she herself was taken out of
trouble Thats the shape her religion takes Tisnt a common form
I knowthis returning good for good with compound interest But her
conscience wont let her rest unless she does everything she can for
me and now shell begin to do everything for Jane because she feels
that selfsacrifice is a duty Anybody can be selfsacrificing If I
made up my mind I could ask Mrs Mumpson to visit us all summer but I
couldnt like her to save my life and I dont suppose Alida can like
me beyond a certain point to save her life But shell do her duty
Shell be pleasant and selfsacrificing and do all the work she can lay
her hands on for my sake but when it comes to feeling toward me as I
cant help feeling toward herthat wasnt in the bargain and he
startled Jane with a sudden bitter laugh

Say said the child as if bent on adding another poignant
reflection if you hadnt married her I could a come and cooked for
you

You think Id been better off if Id waited for you eh

You kinder looked as if yer thought so

He now made the hills echo with a laugh excited both by his bitter
fancies and the preposterous idea She looked at him inquiringly and
was much perplexed by his unwonted behavior Indeed he was slightly
astonished at his own strange mood but he yielded to it almost
recklessly I say Jane he began Im not a very goodlooking man
am I

She shook her head in emphatic agreement

Im old and rough and hardfeatured

Again she nodded approvingly

Children and some others speak the truth he growled

I never had no teachin but Im not a fool remarked Jane keenly

I guess Im the fool in this case he added

It dont make no difference to me she said sympathetically Im
goin to mind you and not her If you ever send her away Ill cook for
you

Send her away exclaimed the farmer with a shiver God forbid
There dont talk any more

For the next half mile he drove in silence with a heavy frown on his
face then he broke out sternly If you dont promise to mind Mrs
Holcroft and please her in everything Ill leave you at the poorhouse
door and drive home again

Course I will if you tells me to said the child in trepidation

Well I DO People will find that making her trouble is the surest
way of making themselves trouble

Shes got some hold on im concluded Jane who in listening to much
gossip had often heard this expression and now made a practical
application of the idea

Watterly was greatly relieved when he saw Holcroft drive up with the
fugitive I was just going out to your place he said for the
girls mother insisted that you had enticed the child away and the
man laughed as if the idea tickled him immensely

Holcroft frowned for he was in no mood for his friends rough jests
Go to your mother till I send for you he said to Jane

The fact that you had taken two other females from the house gave some
color to Mrs Mumpsons views pursued Watterly who could take only
the broadest hint as to his social conduct

He received one now Tom Watterly said the farmer sternly did I
ever insult your wife

By jocks No you nor no other man I should say not

Well then dont you insult mine Before Id seen Mrs Holcroft you
told me she was out of the common runhow much out you little
knowand I dont want her mixed up with the common run even in your
thoughts

Well now I like that said Watterly giving Holcroft his hand You
know I didnt mean any offense Jim It was only one of my foolish
jokes You were mighty slow to promise to love honor and obey but
hanged if you aint more on that line than any man in town I can see
shes turning out well and keeping her agreement

Yes thats just what shes doing said the farmer gloomily Shes a
good capable woman thatll sacrifice herself to her duty any day But
it wasnt to talk about her I came Shes a sight better than I am
but shes probably not good enough for anybody in this town to speak
to

Oh pshaw now Jim

Well Ive come on disagreeable business I didnt know that Mrs
Mumpson and her child were here and I wish to the Lord they could both
stay here Youve found out what the mother is I suppose

I should say so replied Tom laughing Shes talked several of the
old women to death already The first day she was here she called on
my wife and claimed social relations because shes so respecterbly
connected as she says I thought Angyd have a fit Her respectable
connections have got to take her off my hands

Im not one of em thank goodness resumed Holcroft But Im
willing to take the girl and give her a chanceat least Ill do it
he corrected himself in his strict observance of truth You can see
shes not a child to dote on but I was sorry for her when I sent her
mother away and said Id try and do something for her The first thing
I knew she was at the house begging me to either take her in or kill
her I couldnt say no though I wanted to Now you see what kind of
a good Samaritan I am

Oh I know you Youd hit a man between the eyes if he charged you
with doing a good deed But what does your wife say to adopting such a
cherub

Were not going to adopt her or bind ourselves My wife took the
childs part and plead with me in her behalf though I could see the
young one almost made her sick She thinks its her duty you know
and thats enough for her

By jocks Holcroft She dont feel that way about you does she

Why shouldnt she

Why should she I can take about anything from Angy but it wouldnt
do for her to let me see that she disliked me so that I kinder made her
sick

Oh thunder Tom Youre getting a wrong impression I was never
treated better by anybody in my life than by Mrs Holcroft Shes a
lady every inch of her But theres no reason why she should dote on
an old fellow like me

Yes there is I have my opinion of a woman who wouldnt dote on a
man thats been such a friend as you have

Oh hang it all Tom Lets talk about business Shes too
gratefulthats what worries me By the way she took hold and filled
the house with comfort she made everything even from the start Shes
been as good a friend to me as I to her Shes done all she agreed and
more and Ill never hear a word against her The point Ive been
trying to get at is this If Mrs Mumpson will agree never to come near
us or make trouble in any way well take the child If she wont so
agree Ill have nothing to do with the girl I dont want to see her
mother and youd do me one of the kindest turns you ever did a man by
stating the case to her

If I do said Watterly laughing youll have to forgive me
everything in the past and the future

I will Tom for Id rather have an eye tooth pulled than face that
woman Were all rightjust as we used to be at school always half
quarreling yet ready to stand up for each other to the last drop But
I must have her promise in black and white

Well come to my office and well try to arrange it The law is on
your side for the county wont support people that anyone will take
off its hands Besides Im going to shame the womans relations into
taking her away and theyll be glad theres one less to support

They drew up a brief strong agreement and Watterly took it to the
widow to sign He found her in great excitement and Jane looking at
her defiantly I told you he was the one who enticed away my
offspring she began almost hysterically Hes a coldblooded
villain If theres a law in the land Ill

Stop thundered Watterly His voice was so high and authoritative
that she did stop and with open mouth stared at the superintendent
Now be quiet and listen to me he continued Either you are a sane
woman and can stop this foolishness or else you are insane and must be
treated as such You have your choice You cant tell me anything
about Holcroft Ive known him since he was a boy He doesnt want
your girl She ran away to him didnt you to Jane who nodded But
hes willing to take her to teach her something and give her a chance
His motive is pure kindness and he has a good wife wholl

I see it all cried the widow tragically clasping her hands Its
his wifes doings She wishes to triumph over me and even to usurp my
place in ministering to my child Was there ever such an outrage
Such a bold vindictive female

Here Jane in a paroxysm of indignant protest seized her mother and
began to shake her so violently that she could not speak

Stop that said Watterly repressing laughter with difficulty I see
you are insane and the law will have to step in and take care of you
both

What will it do with us gasped the widow

Well it ought to put you in strait jackets to begin with

Ive got some sense if mother aint cried Jane commencing to sob

Its plain the lawll decide your mothers not fit to take care of
you Anyone who can even imagine such silly ridiculous things as shes
just said must be looked after You MAY take a notion Mrs Mumpson
that Im a murderer or a giraffe It would be just as sensible as your
other talk

What does Mr Holcroft offer said the widow cooling off rapidly
If there was an atom of common sense left in any of his pauper charges
Watterly soon brought it into play and his vague threatenings of law
were always aweinspiring

He makes a very kind offer that you would jump at if you had sensea
good home for your child You ought to know she cant stay here and
live on charity if anyone is willing to take her

Of course I would be permitted to visit my child from time to time
He couldnt be so monstrously hardhearted as

Oh nonsense cried Watterly impatiently The idea of his letting
you come to his house after what youve said about him Ive no time
to waste in foolishness or he either He will let Jane visit you but
you are to sign this paper and keep the agreement not to go near him or
make any trouble whatever

Its an abominable

Tut Tut That kind of talk isnt allowed here If you cant decide
like a sane woman the lawll soon decide for you

As was always the case when Mrs Mumpson reached the inevitable she
yielded the paper was signed and Jane who had already made up her
small bundle nodded triumphantly to her mother and followed Watterly
Mrs Mumpson on tiptoe followed also bent on either propitiating
Holcroft and so preparing the way for a visit or else on giving him
once more a piece of her mind

All right Holcroft said Watterly as he entered the office heres
the paper signed Was there ever such an id

Oh how do you do Mr Holcroft cried the widow bursting in and
rushing forward with extended hand

The farmer turned away and looked as if made of stone

Changing her tactics instantly she put her handkerchief to her eyes
and moaned You never can have the heart to say I cant come and see
my child Ive signed writings tis true under threats and
compulsions but I trust there will be relentings

There wont be one relent cried Jane I never want to see you
again and a blind post could see that he doesnt

Jane said Holcroft sternly dont speak so again If strangers can
be kind and patient with you you can be so with your mother She has
no claims on me and has said things which make it impossible for me to
speak to her again but I shall insist on your visiting and treating
her kindly Goodbye Watterly Youve proved yourself a friend
again and he went rapidly away followed by Jane

Mrs Mumpson was so taken aback by Holcrofts final words and
Watterlys stern manner as he said This is my office that for once
in her life she disappeared silently

Holcroft soon purchased the articles on his list meanwhile racking his
brains to think of something that he could buy for Alida but the fear
of being thought sentimental and of appearing to seek a personal regard
for himself not nominated in the bond restrained him

On his way home he was again sunk in deep abstraction but the
bitterness of his feeling had passed away Although as mistaken as
before in his apprehension of Alida his thoughts were kinder and
juster Ive no right to find fault or complain he said to himself
Shes done all I asked and better than she agreed and theres no one
to blame if she cant do more It must have been plain enough to her
at first that I didnt want anything but a housekeepera quiet
friendly body that would look after the house and dairy and shes done
better than I even hoped Thats just the trouble shes turned out so
different from what I expected and looks so different from what she
did that Im just sort of carried away Id give half the farm if she
was sitting by my side this June evening and I could tell her all I
feel and know she was glad I must be just and fair to her I asked
her to agree to one thing and now Im beginning to want a tremendous
sight moreI want her to like not only her home and work and the quiet
life she so longed for but I want her to like me to enjoy my society
not only in a friendly businesslike way but in another wayyes
confound my slow wits Somewhat as if she was my wife in reality and
not merely in name as I insisted Its mighty mean business in me
who have been so proud of standing up to my agreements and so exacting
of others to do the same I went away cold and stiff this afternoon
because she wasnt silly and sentimental when I was Im to her an
unpolished homely middleaged man and yet I sort of scoffed at the
selfsacrifice which has led her to be pleasant and companionable in
every way that her feelings allowed I wish I were younger and better
looking so it wouldnt all be a sense of duty and gratitude
Gratitude be hanged I dont want any more of it Well now James
Holcroft if youre the square man you supposed yourself to be youll
be just as kind and considerate as you know how and then youll leave
Alida to the quiet peaceful life to which she looked forward when she
married you The thing for you to do is to go back to your first ways
after you were married and attend to the farm She doesnt want you
hanging around and looking at her as if she was one of her own posies
Thats something she wasnt led to expect and it would be mean enough
to force it upon her before she shows that she wishes it and I
couldnt complain if she NEVER wished it

During the first hour after Holcrofts departure Alida had been
perplexed and worried but her intuitions soon led to hopefulness and
the beauty and peace of nature without aided in restoring her serenity
The more minutely she dwelt on Holcrofts words and manner the more
true it seemed that he was learning to take an interest in her that was
personal and apart from every other consideration If I am gentle
patient and faithful she thought all will come out right He is
so true and straightforward that I need have no fears

When he returned and greeted her with what seemed his old friendly
natural manner and during a temporary absence of Jane told her
laughingly of the Mumpson episode she was almost completely reassured
Suppose the widow breaks through all restraint and appears as did
Jane what would you do he asked

Whatever you wished she replied smiling

In other words what you thought your duty

I suppose that is what one should try to do

I guess you are the one that would succeed in doing it even to Mrs
Mumpson he said turning hastily away and going to his room

She was puzzled again Im sure I dont dote on selfsacrifice and
hard duty any more than he does but I cant tell him that duty is not
hard when its to him

Jane was given the room over the kitchen which Mrs Wiggins had
occupied and the farmhouse soon adopted her into its quiet routine
Holcrofts course continued to cause Alida a dissatisfaction which she
could scarcely define He was as kind as ever he had been and even more
considerate he not only gratified her wishes but tried to anticipate
them while Janes complete subserviency proved that she had been
spoken to very plainly

One day she missed her spelling lesson for the third time and Alida
told her that she must learn it thoroughly before going out The child
took the book reluctantly yet without a word Thats a good girl
said Alida wishing to encourage her I was afraid at first you
wouldnt mind me so readily

He told me to Hed fire me out the window if I didnt mind you

Oh no I think hes very kind to you

Well hes kind to you too

Yes he has always been kind to me said Alida gently and
lingeringly as if the thought were pleasant to dwell upon

Say said Jane yielding to her curiosity how did you make him so
afraid of you when he dont like you He didnt like mother but he
wasnt afraid of her

Why do you think he doesnt like me Alida faltered turning very
pale

Oh Cause he looked once jest as he did after motherd been goin
for

There be still You mustnt speak of such things or talk to me
about Mr Holcroft in such a way and she hastily left the kitchen
When in the solitude of her own room she gave way to bitter tears Is
it so plain she thought that even this ignorant child sees it And
the unhappy change began the day she came too I cant understand it
We were so happy before and he seemed to enjoy being near me and
talking to me when his work permitted He used to look into my eyes in
a way that made me hope and indeed feel almost sure I receive no
more such looks he seems only trying to do his duty by me as he
promised at first and acts as if it were all duty a mere matter of
conscience Could he have discovered how I felt and so is taking this
way to remind me that nothing of the kind was in our agreement Well
Ive no reason to complain I accepted the relation of my own free
will but its hard hard indeed for a woman who loves a man with her
whole heart and souland he her husbandto go on meeting him day
after day yet act as if she were his mere business partner But I
cant help myself my very nature as well as a sense of his rights
prevents me from asking more or even showing that I wish for more
That WOULD be asking for it But can it be true that he is positively
learning to dislike me To shrink from me with that strong repulsion
which women feel toward some men Oh If that is true the case is
hopeless it would kill me Every effort to win him even the most
delicate and unobtrusive would only drive him farther away the
deepest instincts of his soul would lead him to withdrawto shun me
If this is true the time may come when so far from my filling his
house with comfort I shall make him dread to enter it Oh oh My
only course is to remember just what I promised and he expected when he
married me and live up to that

Thus husband and wife reached the same conclusion and were rendered
equally unhappy



Chapter XXX

Holcrofts Best Hope

When Holcroft came in to dinner that day the view he had adopted was
confirmed yet Alidas manner and appearance began to trouble him
Even to his rather slow perception she did not seem so happy as she
had been She did not meet his eye with her old frank friendly and
as he had almost hoped affectionate expression she seemed merely
feverishly anxious to do everything and have all as he wished Instead
of acting with natural ease and saying what was in her mind without
premeditation a conscious effort was visible and an apparent
solicitude that he should be satisfied The inevitable result was that
he was more dissatisfied Shes doing her best for me he growled as
he went back to his work and it begins to look as if it might wear
her out in time Confound it Having everything just so isnt of much
account when a mans hearthungry Id rather have had one of her old
smiles and gone without my dinner Well well how little a man
understands himself or knows the future The day I married her I was
in mortal dread lest she should care for me too much and want to be
affectionate and all that and here I am discontented and moping
because everything has turned out as I then wished Dont see as Im
to blame either She had no business to grow so pretty Then she
looked like a ghost but now when the color comes into her cheeks and
her blue eyes sparkle a man would be a stupid clod if he didnt look
with all his eyes and feel his heart athumping That she should
change so wasnt in the bargain neither was it that she should read
aloud in such sweet tones that a fellowd like to listen to the
dictionary nor that she should make the house and yard look as they
never did before and strangest of all open my eyes to the fact that
apple trees bear flowers as well as pippins I cant even go by a wild
posy in the lane without thinking shed like it and see in it a sight
more than I once could Ive been taken in as old Jonathan feared
he muttered following out his fancy with a sort of grim humor She
isnt the woman I thought I was marrying at all and I aint bound by my
agreementnot in my thoughts anyhow Id have been in a nice scrape
if Id taken my little affidavit not to think of her or look upon her
in any other light than that of housekeeper and butter maker Its a
scary thing this getting married with a single eye to business See
where I am now Hanged if I dont believe Im in love with my wife
and like a thundering fool I had to warn her against falling in love
with me Little need of that though She hasnt been taken in for
Im the same old chap she married and Id be a mighty mean cuss if I
went to her and said Here I want you to do twice as much a
hundredfold as much as you agreed to Id be a fool too for she
couldnt do it unless something drew her toward me just as Im drawn
toward her

Late in the afternoon he leaned on the handle of his corn plow and in
the consciousness of solitude said aloud Things grow clear if you
think of them enough and the Lord knows I dont think of much else any
more It isnt her good qualities which I say over to myself a hundred
times a day or her education or anything of the kind that draws me
its she herself I like her Why dont I say love her and be
honest Well its a fact and Ive got to face it Here I am
plowing out my corn and it looks splendid for its age I thought if I
could stay on the old place and plant and cultivate and reap Id be
more than content and now I dont seem to care a rap for the corn or
the farm either compared with Alida and I care for her just because
she is Alida and no one else But the other side of this fact has an
ugly look Suppose Im disagreeable to her When she married me she
felt like a woman drowning she was ready to take hold of the first
hand reached to her without knowing much about whose hand it was
Well shes had time to find out She isnt drawn Perhaps she feels
toward me somewhat as I did toward Mrs Mumpson and she cant help
herself either Well well the bare thought of it makes my heart
lead Whats a man to do What can I do but live up to my agreement
and not torment her any more than I can help with my company Thats
the only honest course Perhaps shell get more used to me in time
She might get sick and then Id be so kind and watchful that shed
think the old fellow wasnt so bad after all But I shant give her
the comfort of no end of selfsacrifice in trying to be pleasant and
sociable If shes foolish enough to think shes in my debt she cant
pay it in that way No sir Ive got to make the most of it nowIm
bound tobut this business marriage will never suit me until the white
arm I saw in the dairy room is around my neck and she looks in my eyes
and says James I guess Im ready for a longer marriage ceremony

It was a pity that Alida could not have been among the hazelnut bushes
near and heard him

He resumed his toil working late and doggedly At supper he was very
attentive to Alida but taciturn and preoccupied and when the meal was
over he lighted his pipe and strolled out into the moonlight She
longed to follow him yet felt it to be more impossible than if she
were chained to the floor

And so the days passed Holcroft striving with the whole force of his
will to appear absorbed in the farm and she with equal effort to
seem occupied and contented with her household and dairy duties They
did everything for each other that they could and yet each thought
that the other was acting from a sense of obligation and so all the
more sedulously veiled their actual thoughts and feelings from each
other Or course such mistaken effort only led to a more complete
misunderstanding

With people of their simplicity and habit of reticence little of what
was in their hearts appeared on the surface Neither had time to mope
and their mutual duties were in a large measure a support and refuge
Of these they could still speak freely for they pertained to business
Alidas devotion to her work was unfeigned for it seemed now her only
avenue of approach to her husband She watched over the many broods of
little chickens with tireless vigilance If it were yellow gold she
could not have gathered the butter from the churn with greater greed
She kept the house immaculate and sought to develop her cooking into a
fine art She was scrupulous in giving Jane her lessons and trying to
correct her vernacular and manners but the presence of the child grew
to be a heavier cross every day She could not blame the girl whose
misfortune it was to lead incidentally to the change in Holcrofts
manner yet it was impossible not to associate her with the beginning
of that change Jane was making decided improvement and had Alida
been happy and at rest this fact would have given much satisfaction in
spite of the instinctive repugnance which the girl seemed to inspire
universally Holcroft recognized this repugnance and the patient
effort to disguise it and be kind

Like enough she feels in the same way toward me he thought and is
trying a sight harder not to show it But she seems willing enough to
talk business and to keep up her interest in the partnership line
Well blamed if I wouldnt rather talk business to her than love to any
other woman

So it gradually came about that they had more and more to say to each
other on matters relating to the farm Holcroft showed her the
receipts from the dairy and her eyes sparkled as if he had brought
jewels home to her Then she in turn would expatiate on the poultry
interests and assure him that there were already nearly two hundred
little chicks on the place One afternoon during a shower she
ventured to beguile him into listening to the greater part of one of
the agricultural journals and with much deference made two or three
suggestions about the farm which he saw were excellent She little
dreamed that if she were willing to talk of turning the farm upside
down and inside out he would have listened with pleasure

They both began to acquire more serenity and hopefulness for even this
sordid business partnership was growing strangely interesting The
meals grew less and less silent and the farmer would smoke his pipe
invitingly near in the evening so that she could resume their talk on
bucolic subjects without much conscious effort while at the same time
if she did not wish his society she could shun it without discourtesy
He soon perceived that she needed some encouragement to talk even of
farm matters but having received it that she showed no further
reluctance He naturally began to console himself with business as
unstintedly as he dared As long as I keep on this tack all seems
well he muttered She dont act as if I was disagreeable to her but
then how can a man tell If she thinks it her duty shell talk and
smile yet shiver at the very thought of my touching her Well well
time will show We seem to be getting more sociable anyhow

They both recognized this fact and tried to disguise it and to relieve
themselves from the appearance of making any undue advances by greater
formality of address In Janes presence he had formed the habit of
speaking to his wife as Mrs Holcroft and now he was invariably Mr

One evening in the latter part of June he remarked at supper I must
give half a day to hoeing the garden tomorrow Ive been so busy
working out the corn and potatoes that it seems an age since Ive been
in the garden

She and me began Jane I mean Mrs Holcroft and I have been in the
garden

Thats right Jane Youre coming on I think your improved talk and
manners do Mrs Holcroft much credit Id like to take some lessons
myself Then as if a little alarmed at his words he hastened to
ask What have you been doing in the garden

Youll see when you go there replied Jane her small eyes twinkling
with the rudiments of fun

Holcroft looked at the child as if he had not seen her for some time
either Her hair was neatly combed braided and tied with a blue
ribbon instead of a string her gown was as becoming as any dress could
be to her her little brown hands were clean and they no longer
managed the knife and fork in an illbred manner The very expression
of the childs face was changing and now that it was lighted up with
mirth at the little surprise awaiting him it had at least attained the
negative grace of being no longer repulsive He sighed involuntarily
as he turned away Just see what shes doing for that child that I
once thought hideous How much she might do for me if she cared as I
do

He rose from the table lighted his pipe and went out to the doorstep
Alida looked at him wistfully He stood there with me once and faced a
mob of men she thought Then he put his arm around me I would face
almost any danger for even such a caress again The memory of that
hour lent her unwonted courage and she approached him timidly and
said Perhaps you would like to go and look at the garden Jane and I
may not have done everything right

Why certainly I forgot about the garden but then youll have to go
with me if Im to tell you

I dont mind she said leading the way

The June sun was low in the west and the air had become deliciously
cool and fragrant The old rosebushes were in bloom and as she passed
she picked a bud and fastened it on her bosom Wood thrushes orioles
and the whole chorus of birds were in full song limpid rills of melody
from the meadow larks flowed from the fields and the whistling of the
quails added to the harmony

Holcroft was in a mood of which he had never been conscious before
These familiar sounds which had been unheeded so much of his life now
affected him strangely creating an immeasurable sadness and longing
It seemed as if perceptions which were like new senses were awakening
in his mind The world was full of wonderful beauty before
unrecognized and the woman who walked lightly and gracefully at his
side was the crown of it all He himself was so old plain and
unworthy in contrast His heart ached with a positive definite pain
that he was not younger handsomer and better equipped to win the love
of his wife As she stood in the garden wearing the rose her neat
dress outlining her graceful form the level rays of the sun lighting
up her face and turning her hair to gold he felt that he had never
seen or imagined such a woman before She was in harmony with the June
evening and a part of it while he in his working clothes his rugged
sunbrowned features and hair tinged with gray was a blot upon the
scene She who was so lovely must be conscious of his rude clownish
appearance He would have faced any man living and held his own on the
simple basis of his manhood Anything like scorn although veiled on
Alidas part would have touched his pride and steeled his will but
the words and manner of this gentle woman who tried to act as if blind
to all that he was in contrast with herself to show him deference
kindness and good will when perhaps she felt toward him somewhat as
she did toward Jane overwhelmed him with humility and grief It is
the essence of deep unselfish love to depreciate itself and exalt its
object There was a superiority in Alida which Holcroft was learning to
recognize more clearly every day and he had not a trace of vanity to
sustain him Now he was in a mood to wrong and undervalue himself
without limit

She showed him how much she and Jane had accomplished how neat and
clean they had kept the rows of growing vegetables and how good the
promise was for an indefinite number of dinners but she only added to
the farmers depression He was in no mood for onions parsnips and
their vegetable kin yet thought She thinks Im only capable of being
interested in such things and Ive been at much pains to give that
impression She picked that rose for HERSELF and now shes showing ME
how soon we may hope to have summer cabbage and squash She thus shows
that she knows the difference between us and that always must be
between us I fear She is so near in our daily life yet how can I
ever get any nearer As I feel now it seems impossible

She had quickly observed his depressed abstracted manner but
misinterpreted the causes Her own face clouded and grew troubled
Perhaps she was revealing too much of her heart although seeking to
disguise it so sedulously and he was penetrating her motives for doing
so much in the garden and in luring him thither now He was not
showing much practical interest in beans and beets and was evidently
oppressed and ill at ease

I hope we have done things right she ventured turning away to hide
tears of disappointment

Her selfsacrifice is giving out he thought bitterly She finds
she can scarcely look at me as I now appear in contrast with this June
evening Well I dont blame her It makes me almost sick when I
think of myself and I wont be brute enough to say a harsh word to
her You have done it all far better than I could he said
emphatically I would not have believed it if you hadnt shown me
The trouble is you are trying to do too much II think Ill take a
walk

In fact he had reached the limit of endurance he could not look upon
her another moment as she appeared that evening and feel that she
associated him chiefly with crops and business and that all her
grateful good will could not prevent his personality from being
disagreeable He must carry his bitterness whither no eye could see
him and as he turned his selfdisgust led him to whirl away his pipe
It struck a tree and fell shattered at its foot Alida had never seen
him do anything of the kind before and it indicated that he was
passing beyond the limits of patience Oh oh she sobbed I fear we
are going to drift apart If he cant endure to talk with me about
such things what chance have I at all I hoped that the hour the
beauty of the evening and the evidence that I had been trying so hard
to please him would make him more like what he used to be before he
seemed to take a dislike Theres only one way to account for it
allhe sees how I feel and he doesnt like it My very love sets him
against me My heart was overflowing tonight How could I help it as
I remembered how he stood up for me He was brave and kind he meant
well by me he means well now but he cant help his feelings He has
gone away now to think of the woman that he did love and loves still
and it angers him that I should think of taking her place He loved
her as a child and girl and womanhe told me so he warned me and said
he could not help thinking of her If I had not learned to love him so
deeply and passionately and show it in spite of myself time would
gradually have softened the past and all might have gone well Yet how
could I help it when he saved me from so much I feel tonight though
that I only escaped one kind of trouble to meet another almost as bad
and which may become worse

She strolled to the farther end of the garden that she might become
calm before meeting Janes scrutiny Useless precaution For the girl
had been watching them both Her motive had not been unmixed
curiosity since having taken some part in the garden work she had
wished to witness Holcrofts pleasure and hear his praises Since the
actors in the scene so misunderstood each other she certainly would
not rightly interpret them Shes losin her hold on im she
thought He acted just as if she was mother

When Jane saw Alida coming toward the house she whisked from the
concealing shrubbery to the kitchen again and was stolidly washing the
dishes when her mistress entered You are slow tonight said Alida
looking at the child keenly but the impassive face revealed nothing
She set about helping the girl feeling it would be a relief to keep
her hands busy

Janes efforts to comfort were always maladroit yet the apparent
situation so interested her that she yielded to her inclination to
talk Say she began and Alida was too dejected and weary to correct
the childs vernacular Mr Holcrofts got somethin on his mind

Well thats not strange

No spose not Hate to see im look so though He always used to
look so when mother went for im and hung around im At last he
cleared mother out and just before he looked as black as he did when
he passed the house while ago Youre good to me an Id like you to
stay Fis you Id leave im alone

Jane said Alida coldly I dont wish you ever to speak to me of
such things again and she hastily left the room

Oh well muttered Jane Ive got eyes in my head If youre goin
to be foolish like mother and keep agoin for im its your
lookout I kin get along with him and he with me and IM goin to
stay

Holcroft strode rapidly up the lane to the deep solitude at the edge of
his woodland Beneath him lay the farm and the home that he had
married to keep yet now without a seconds hesitation he would part
with all to call his wife WIFE How little the name now satisfied him
without the sweet realities of which the word is significant The term
and relation had become a mocking mirage He almost cursed himself
that he had exulted over his increasing bank account and general
prosperity and had complacently assured himself that she was doing
just what he had asked without any sentimental nonsense How could I
expect it to turn out otherwise he thought From the first I made
her think I hadnt a soul for anything but crops and money Now that
shes getting over her trouble and away from it shes more able to see
just what I am or at least what she naturally thinks I am But she
doesnt understand meI scarcely understand myself I long to be a
different man in every way and not to work and live like an ox Here
are some of my crops almost ready to gather and they never were better
yet Ive no heart for the work Seems to me itll wear me out if I
have to carry this load of trouble all the time I thought my old
burdens hard to bear I thought I was lonely before but it was nothing
compared with living near one you love but from whom you are cut off
by something you cant see yet must feel to the bottom of your heart

His distraught eyes rested on the church spire fading in the twilight
and the little adjoining graveyard Oh Bessie he groaned why did
you die I was good enough for YOU Oh That all had gone on as it
was and I had never known

He stopped shook his head and was silent At last he signed I DID
love Bessie I love and respect her memory as much as ever But
somehow I never felt as I do now All was quiet and matteroffact in
those days yet it was real and satisfying I was content to live on
one day like another to the end of my days If I hadnt been so
content it would be better for me now Id have a better chance if I
had read more thought more and fitted myself to be more of a
companion for a woman like Alida If I knew a great deal and could
talk well she might forget Im old and homely Bessie was so true a
friend that she would wish if she knows what I wish I thought I
needed a housekeeper I find I need more than all else such a wife as
Alida could beone that could help me to be a man instead of a drudge
a Christian instead of a discontented and uneasy unbeliever At one
time it seemed that she was leading me along so naturally and
pleasantly that I never was so happy then all at once it came to me
that she was doing it from gratitude and a sense of duty and the duty
grows harder for her every day Well there seems nothing for it now
but to go on as we began and hope that the future will bring us more in
sympathy



Chapter XXXI

Never

For the next two or three days Jane had no occasion to observe that
Alida was in the least degree obtrusive in her attention to the farmer
She was assiduous in her work and more diligent than ever in her
conscious efforts to do what she thought he wished but she was growing
pale constrained and silent She struggled heroically to appear as
at first but without much success for she could not rally from the
wound he had given her so unintentionally and which Janes words had
deepened She almost loathed herself under her association with Mrs
Mumpson and her morbid thoughts had hit upon a worse reason for
Holcrofts apparent repulsion As she questioned everything in the
sleepless hours that followed the interview in the garden she came to
the miserable conclusion that he had discovered her love and that by
suggestion natural to his mind it reminded him of her pitiful story
He could be sorry for her and be kind he could even be her honest
friend and protector as a wronged and unhappy woman but he could not
love one with a history like hers and did not wish her to love him
This seemed an adequate explanation of the change in their relations
but she felt that it was one under which her life would wither and her
heart break

This promised to be worse than what she had dreaded at the
almshousethe facing the world alone and working till she died among
strangers The fact that they were strangers would enable her to see
their averted faces with comparative indifference but that the man to
whom she had yielded her whole heart should turn away was intolerable
She felt that he could not do this willingly but only under the
imperious instincts of his naturethat he was virtually helpless in
the matter There was an element in these thoughts which stung her
womans soul and as we have said she could not rally

Holcroft never suspected her morbid thoughts and his loyal loving
heart was incapable of dreaming of them He only grew more unhappy as
he saw the changes in her for he regarded himself as the cause Yet
he was perplexed and unable to account for her rapidly increasing
pallor while he continued so kind considerate and especially so
unobtrusive He assuredly thought he was showing a disposition to give
her all the time she wished to become reconciled to her lot Thunder
he said to himself we cant grow old together without getting used to
each other

On Saturday noon at dinner he remarked I shall have to begin haying
on Monday and so Ill take everything to town this afternoon for I
wont be able to go again for some days Is there anything youd like
me to get Mrs Holcroft

She shook her head I dont need anything she replied He looked at
her downcast face with troubled eyes and shivered She looks as if she
were going to be sick he thought Good Lord I feel as if there was
nothing but trouble ahead Every mouthful I take seems to choke me

A little later he pushed away almost untasted a piece of delicious
cherry pie the first of the season Alida could scarcely keep the
tears back as she thought There was a time when he would have praised
it without stint I took so much pains with it in the hope hed
notice for he once said he was very fond of it Such were the straws
that were indicating the deep dark currents

As he rose she said almost apathetically in her dejection Mr
Holcroft Jane and I picked a basket of the early cherries You may as
well sell them for there are plenty left on the tree for us

That was too much for you to do in the hot sun Well Ill sell em
and add what they bring to your egg money in the bank Youll get
rich he continued trying to smile if you dont spend more

I dont wish to spend anything she said turning away with the
thought How can he think I want finery when my heart is breaking

Holcroft drove away looking and feeling as if he were going to a
funeral At last he broke out I cant stand this another day
Tomorrows Sunday and Ill manage to send Jane somewhere or take Alida
out to walk and tell her the whole truth She shall be made to see
that I cant help myself and that Im willing to do anything she
wishes Shes married to me and has got to make the best of it and
Im sure Im willing to make it as easy as I can

Jane was a little perplexed at the condition of affairs Mrs Holcroft
had left her husband alone as far as possible as she had advised but
apparently it had not helped matters much But she believed that the
trouble she had witnessed bode her no ill and so was inclined to regard
it philosophically He looks almost as glum when hes goin round
alone as if hed married mother She talked too much and that didnt
please him this one talks less and less and he dont seem pleased
nuther but it seems to me hes very foolish to be so faultfindin
when she does everything for him topnotch I never lived so well in
my life nor he nuther I believe He must be in a bad way when he
couldnt eat that cherry pie

Alida was so weary and felt so ill that she went to the parlor and lay
down upon the lounge My heart feels as if it were bleeding slowly
away she murmured If Im going to be sick the best thing I can do
is to die and end it all and she gave way to that deep dejection in
which there seems no remedy for trouble

The hours dragged slowly by Jane finished her household tasks very
leisurely then taking a basket went out to the garden to pick some
early peas While thus engaged she saw a man coming up the lane His
manner instantly riveted her attention and awakened her curiosity and
she crouched lower behind the pea vines for concealment All her
furtive watchful instincts were awake and her conscience was clear
too for certainly she had a right to spy upon a stranger

The man seemed almost as furtive as herself his eyes were everywhere
and his step slow and hesitating Instead of going directly to the
house he cautiously entered the barn and she heard him a little later
call Mr Holcroft Of course there was no answer and as if reassured
he approached the house looking here and there on every side
seemingly to see if anyone was about Jane had associated with men and
boys too long to have any childlike timidity and she also had just
confidence in her skulking and running powers After all he dont
want nothin of me and wont hurt me she reasoned He acts mighty
queer though and Im goin to hear what he says

The moment he passed the angle of the house she dodged around to its
rear and stole into the dairy room being well aware that from this
position she could overhear words spoken in ordinary conversational
tones in the apartment above She had barely gained her ambush when she
heard Alida half shriek Henry Ferguson

It was indeed the man who had deceived her that had stolen upon her
solitude His somewhat stealthy approach had been due to the wish and
expectation of finding her alone and he had about convinced himself
that she was so by exploring the barn and observing the absence of the
horses and wagon Cunning and unscrupulous it was his plan to appear
before the woman who had thought herself his wife without any warning
whatever believing that in the tumult of her surprise and shock she
would be off her guard and that her old affection would reassert
itself He passed through the kitchen to the parlor door Alida in
her deep painful abstraction did not hear him until he stood in the
doorway and with outstretched arms breathed her name Then as if
struck a blow she had sprung to her feet half shrieked his name and
stood panting regarding him as if he were a specter

Your surprise is natural Alida dear he said gently but Ive a
right to come to you for my wife is dead and he advanced toward her

Stand back she cried sternly Youve no right and never can have

Oh yes I have he replied in a wheedling tone Come come Your
nerves are shaken Sit down for Ive much to tell you

No I wont sit down and I tell you to leave me instantly Youve no
right here and I no right to listen to you

I can soon prove that you have a better right to listen to me than to
anyone else Were we not married by a minister

Yes but that made no difference You deceived both him and me

It made no difference perhaps in the eye of the law while that
woman you saw was living but shes dead as I can easily prove How
were you married to this man Holcroft

Alida grew dizzy everything whirled and grew black before her eyes as
she sank into a chair He came to her and took her hand but his touch
was a most effectual restorative She threw his hand away and said
hoarsely Do youdo you mean that you have any claim on me

Who has a better claim he asked cunningly I loved you when I
married you and I love you now Do you think I rested a moment after I
was free from the woman I detested No indeed nor did I rest till I
found out who took you from the almshouse to be his household drudge
not wife Ive seen the justice who aided in the wedding farce and
learned how this man Holcroft made him cut down even the ceremony of a
civil marriage to one sentence It was positively heathenish and he
only took you because he couldnt get a decent servant to live with
him

O God murmured the stricken woman Can such a horrible thing be

So it seems he resumed misinterpreting her Come now he said
confidently and sitting down Dont look so broken up about it Even
while that woman was living I felt that I was married to you and you
only now that Im free

But Im not free and dont wish to be

Dont be foolish Alida You know this farmer dont care a rap for
you Own up now does he

The answer was a low halfdespairing cry

There I knew it was so What else could you expect Dont you see
Im your true refuge and not this hardhearted moneygrasping farmer

Stop speaking against him she cried O God she wailed can the
law give this man any claim on me now his wife is dead

Yes and one I mean to enforce he replied doggedly

I dont believe shes dead I dont believe anything you say You
deceived me once

Im not deceiving you now Alida he said with much solemnity She
IS dead If you were calmer I have proofs to convince you in these
papers Heres the newspaper too containing the notice of her
death and he handed it to her

She read it with her frightened eyes and then the paper dropped from
her halfparalyzed hands to the floor She was so unsophisticated and
her brain was in such a whirl of confusion and terror that she was led
to believe at the moment that he had a legal claim upon her which he
could enforce

Oh that Mr Holcroft were here she cried desperately He wouldnt
deceive me he never deceived me

It is well for him that he isnt here said Ferguson assuming a dark
look

What do you mean she gasped

Come come Alida he said smiling reassuringly You are frightened
and nervous and I dont wish to make you any more so You know how I
would naturally regard the man who I feel has my wife but let us
forget about him Listen to my plan All I ask of you is to go with me
to some distant place where neither of us are known and

Never she interrupted

Dont say that he replied coolly Do you think Im a man to be
trifled with after what Ive been through

You cant compel me to go against my will and there was an accent of
terror in her words which made them a question

He saw his vantage more clearly and said quietly I dont want to
compel you if it can be helped You know how true I was to you

No no You deceived me I wont believe you now

You may have to At any rate you know how fond I was of you and I
tell you plainly I wont give you up now This man doesnt love you
nor do you love him

I DO love him Id die for him There now you know the truth You
wouldnt compel a woman to follow you who shrinks from you in horror
even if you had the right Although the ceremony was brief it WAS a
ceremony and he was not married then as you were when you deceived
me He has ever been truth itself and I wont believe you have any
rights till he tells me so himself

So you shrink from me with horror do you asked Ferguson rising
his face growing black with passion

Yes I do Now leave me and let me never see you again

And you are going to ask this stupid old farmer about my rights

Yes Ill take proof of them from no other and even if he confirmed
your words Id never live with you again I would live alone till I
died

Thats all very foolish high tragedy but if youre not careful there
may be some real tragedy If you care for this Holcroft as you say
you had better go quietly away with me

What do you mean she faltered tremblingly

I mean Im a desperate man whom the world has wronged too much
already You know the old saying Beware of the quiet man You know
how quiet contented and happy I was with you and so I would be again
to the end of my days You are the only one who can save me from
becoming a criminal a vagabond for with you only have I known
happiness Why should I live or care to live If this farmer clod
keeps you from me woe betide him My one object in living will be his
destruction I shall hate him only as a man robbed as I am can hate

What would you do she could only ask in a horrified whisper

I can only tell you that hed never be safe a moment Im not afraid
of him You see Im armed and he showed her a revolver He cant
quietly keep from me what I feel is my own

Merciful Heaven This is terrible she gasped

Of course its terribleI mean it to be so You cant order me off
as if I were a tramp Your best course for his safety is to go quietly
with me at once I have a carriage waiting near at hand

No no Id rather die than do that and though he cannot feel as I
do I believe hed rather die than have me do it

Oh well If you think hes so ready to die

No I dont mean that Kill me I want to die

Why should I kill you he asked with a contemptuous laugh That
wouldnt do me a particle of good It will be your own fault if anyone
is hurt

Was ever a woman put in such a cruel position

Oh yes Many and many a time As a rule though they are too
sensible and kindhearted to make so much trouble

If you have legal rights why dont you quietly enforce them instead
of threatening

For a moment he was confused and then said recklessly It would come
to the same thing in the end Holcroft would never give you up

Hed have to I wouldnt stay here a moment if I had no right

But you said you would not live with me again

Nor would I Id go back to the poorhouse and die there for do you
think I could live after another such experience But my mind has
grown clearer You are deceiving me again and Mr Holcroft is
incapable of deceiving me He would never have called me his wife
unless I was his wife before God and man

Im not deceiving you in regard to one thing he said tragically

O God what shall I do

If you wont go with me you must leave him he replied believing
that if this step were taken others would follow

If I leave himif I go away and live alone will you promise to do
him no harm

Id have no motive to harm him then which will be better security
than a promise At the same time I do promise

And you will also promise to leave me utterly alone

If I can

You must promise never even to tempt me to think of going away Id
rather youd shot me than ask it Im not a weak timid girl Im a
brokenhearted woman who fears some things far more than death

If you have any fears for Holcroft they are very rational ones

It is for his sake that I would act I would rather suffer anything
and lose everything than have harm come to him

All I can say is that if you will leave him completely and finally I
will let him alone But you must do it promptly Everything depends
upon this Im in too reckless and bitter a mood to be trifled with
Besides Ive plenty of money and could escape from the country in
twentyfour hours You neednt think you can tell this story to
Holcroft and that he can protect you and himself Im here under an
assumed name and have seen no one who knows me I may have to
disappear for a time and be disguised when I come again but I pledge
you my word hell never be safe as long as you are under his roof

Then I will sacrifice myself for him she said pallid even to her
lips I will go away But never dream that you can come near me
againyou who deceived and wronged me and now far worse threaten
the man I love

Well see about that he replied cynically At any rate you will
have left him

Go she said imperiously

Ill take a kiss first sweetheart he said advancing with a
sardonic smile

Jane she shrieked He paused and she saw evidences of alarm

The girl ran lightly out of the dairy room where she had been a greedy
listener to all that had been said and a moment later appeared in the
yard before the house Yesm she answered

Be careful now sir said Alida sternly Theres a witness

Only a little idioticlooking girl

Shes not idiotic and if you touch me the compacts broken

Very well my time will come Remember youve been warned and he
pulled his hat over his eyes and strode away

Bah said Jane with a snicker as if I hadnt seen his ugly mug so
Id know it mong a thousand

With a face full of loathing and dread Alida watched her enemy
disappear down the lane and then half fainting sank on the lounge

Jane she called feebly but there was no answer



Chapter XXXII

Jane Plays Mouse to the Lion

It can well be understood that Jane had no disposition to return to
Mrs Holcroft and the humdrum duties of the house There opened before
her an exciting line of action which fully accorded with her nature
and she entered upon it at once Her first impulse was to follow the
man of whom she had learned so much Not only was she spurred to this
course by her curiosity but also by her instinctive loyalty to
Holcroft and it must be admitted by her own interests Poor little
Jane had been nurtured in a hard school and had by this time learned
the necessity of looking out for herself This truth united with her
shrewd matteroffact mind led her to do the most sensible thing
under the circumstances I know a lot now that hell be glad to know
and if I tell him everything hell keep me always The first thing
hell want to know is whats become of that threatenin scamp and she
followed Ferguson with the stealth of an Indian

Ferguson was not only a scamp but like most of his class a coward
He had been bitterly disappointed in his interview with Alida As far
as his selfish nature permitted he had a genuine affection for her
and he had thought of little else besides her evident fondness for him
He was so devoid of moral principle that he could not comprehend a
nature like hers and had scarcely believed it possible that she would
repulse him so inflexibly She had always been so gentle yielding
and subservient to his wishes that he had thought that having been
assured of his wifes death a little persuasion and perhaps a few
threats would induce her to follow him for he could not imagine her
becoming attached to such a man as Holcroft had been described to be
Her uncompromising principle had entered but slightly into his
calculations and so under the spur of anger and selfishness he had
easily entered upon a game of bluff He knew well enough that he had no
claim upon Alida yet it was in harmony with his false heart to try to
make her think so He had no serious intention of harming Holcrofthe
would be afraid to attempt thisbut if he could so work on Alidas
fears as to induce her to leave her husband he believed that the
future would be full of possibilities At any rate he would find his
revenge in making Alida and Holcroft all the trouble possible Even in
the excitement of the interview however he realized that he was
playing a dangerous game and when Jane answered so readily to Alidas
call he was not a little disturbed Satisfied that he had accomplished
all that he could hope for at present his purpose now was to get back
to town unobserved and await developments He therefore walked rapidly
down the lane and pursued the road for a short distance until he came
to an old disused lane leading up the hillside into a grove where he
had concealed a horse and buggy Unless there should be necessity it
was his intention to remain in his hiding place until after nightfall

Jane had merely to skirt the bushy hillside higher up in order to keep
Ferguson in view and discover the spot in which he was lurking
Instead of returning to the house she kept right on maintaining a
sharp eye on the road beneath to make sure that Holcroft did not pass
unobserved By an extended detour she reached the highway and
continued toward town in the hope of meeting the farmer At last she
saw him driving rapidly homeward He was consumed with anxiety to be
at least near to Alida even if as he believed he was no longer
welcome in her presence When Jane stepped out into the road he pulled
up his horses and stared at her She almost bursting with her great
secrets put her finger on her lips and nodded portentously

Well what is it he asked his heart beating quickly

Ive got a lot to tell yer but dont want no one to see us

About my wife

The girl nodded

Good God Speak then Is she sick and he sprung out and caught her
arm with a grip that hurt her

Please sir Im doin all I kin for yer andand you hurt me

Holcroft saw the tears coming to her eyes and he released his hold as
he said Forgive me Jane I didnt mean to but for mercys sake
tell your story

Its a long un

Well well give me the gist of it in a word

I guess shes goin to run away

Holcroft groaned and almost staggered to his horses heads then led
them to the roadside and tied them to a tree Sitting down as if too
weak to stand he buried his face in his hands He could not bear to
have Jane see his distress Tell your story he said hoarsely
quick for I may have to act quickly

Guess yer will Did yer know she was married

Certainlyto me

No to another manmarried by a minister Hes been there with her
She little foresaw the effect of her words for the farmer bounded to
his feet with an oath and sprang to his horses

Stop cried Jane tugging at his arm If you go rushin home now
youll show youve got no more sense than mother Youll spoil
everything She aint goin to run away with HIMshe said she
wouldnt though he coaxed and threatened to kill yer if she didnt
Fis a man I wouldnt act like a mad bull Id find out how to get
ahead of tother man

Well said Holcroft in a voice that frightened the child she said
she wouldnt run away with this scoundrelof course notbut you say
shes going to leave Shell meet him somewheregood God But how
should you understand Come let me get home

I understand a sight moren you do and you go on so that I cant tell
you anything If you showed sense youd be glad I was lookin out for
you so I could tell you everything Whats the good of goin
rampaigin home when if youd only listen you could get even with
that scoundrel as yer call im and make all right and Jane began to
cry

Oh thunder exclaimed the chafing man tell me your story at once
or youll drive me mad You dont half know what youre talking about
or how much your words meanhow should you The thing to do is to get
home as soon as possible

You aint no reason to be so mad and glum all the while cried Jane
smarting under a sense of injustice Here Im atryin to do for you
and youll be sorry ernuff if you dont stop and listen And shes
been atryin to do for you all along and shes been standin up for
you this afternoon and is goin to run away to save your life

Run away to save my life Are you crazy

No but you be cried the girl excited and exasperated beyond
restraint If she IS your wife Id stand up for her and take care of
her since she stands up for you so Stead of that you go round as
glum as a thundercloud and now want to go ragin home to her Dunno
whether shes your wife or not but I DO know she said she loved you
and ud die for you and she wouldnt do a thing that man asked but go
away to save your life

Holcroft looked at the girl as if dazed Said she LOVED me he
repeated slowly

Of course You knowed that all longanybody could see itan you
dont treat her much bettern you did mother Then with an impatient
gesture she asked Will you sit down and listen

No I wont he cried springing toward his horses Ill find out if
your words are true

Oh yes said Jane contemptuously run right to her to find out
somethin as plain as the nose on her face and run right by the man
that was threatenin her and you too

Wheeling round he asked Where is he

I know but I wont say nuther word till you stop goin on Fis a
man Id find out what to do fore I did anythin

Jane had little comprehension of the tempest she had raised in
Holcrofts soul or its causes and so was in no mood to make allowances
for him By this time the first gust of his passion was passing and
reason resuming its sway He paced up and down in the road a moment or
two and then sat down as he said I dont half understand what youve
been talking about and I fear you dont Youve evidently been
listening and watching and have got hold of something Now Ill be as
patient as I can if youll tell me the whole story quickly and he
turned his flushed quivering face toward her

Then I spose youll scold me for listenin and watchin that scamp
said the girl sullenly

No Jane not in this case Unless your impressions are all mistaken
I may have to thank you all my life Im not one to forget those who
are true to me Now begin at the beginning and go right through to the
end then I may understand better than you can

Jane did as she was told and many says hes and says shes
followed in her literal narrative Holroft again dropped his face into
his hands and before she was through tears of joy trickled through
his fingers When she finished he arose turned away and hastily
wiped his eyes then gave the girl his hand as he said Thank you
Jane Youve tried to be a true friend to me today Ill show you
that I dont forget I was a fool to get in such a rage but you cant
understand and must forgive me Come you see Im quiet now and he
untied the horses and lifted her into his wagon

What yer doin to do she asked as they drove away

Im going to reward you for watching and listening to that scoundrel
but you must not watch me or Mrs Holcroft or listen to what we say
unless we speak before you If you do I shall be very angry Now
youve only one thing more to do and that is show me where this man is
hiding

But you wont go near him alone inquired Jane in much alarm

You must do as I bid you he replied sternly Show me where hes
hiding then stay by the wagon and horses

But he same as said hed kill you

You have your orders was his quiet reply

She looked scared enough but remained silent until they reached a
shaded spot on the road then said If you dont want him to see you
too soon better tie here Hes around yonder in a grove up on the
hill

Holcroft drove to a tree by the side of the highway and again tied his
horses then took the whip from the wagon Are you afraid to go with
me a little way and show me just where he is he asked

No but you oughtn ter go

Come on then You must mind me if you wish to keep my good will I
know what Im about As in his former encounter his weapon was again
a long tough whipstock with a leather thong attached This he cut off
and put in his pocket then followed Janes rapid lead up the hill
Very soon she said Theres the place I saw im in If you will go
Id steal up on him

Yes You stay here She made no reply but the moment he
disappeared she was upon his trail Her curiosity was much greater
than her timidity and she justly reasoned that she had little to fear

Holcroft approached from a point whence Ferguson was expecting no
danger The latter was lying on the ground gnawing his nails in
vexation when he first heard the farmers step Then he saw a
darkvisaged man rushing upon him In the impulse of his terror he
drew his revolver and fired The ball hissed near but did no harm
and before Ferguson could use the weapon again a blow from the
whipstock paralyzed his arm and the pistol dropped to the ground So
also did its owner a moment later under a vindictive rain of blows
until he shrieked for mercy

Dont move said Holcroft sternly and he picked up the revolver So
you meant to kill me eh

No no I didnt I wouldnt have fired if it hadnt been in
selfdefense and because I hadnt time to think He spoke with
difficulty for his mouth was bleeding and he was terribly bruised

A liar too said the farmer glowering down upon him But I knew
that before What did you mean by your threats to my wife

See here Mr Holcroft Im down and at your mercy If youll let me
off Ill go away and never trouble you or your wife again

Oh no said Holcroft with a bitter laugh Youll never never
trouble us again

What do you mean to murder me Ferguson half shrieked

Would killing such a thing as you be murder Any jury in the land
would acquit me You ought to be roasted over a slow fire

The fellow tried to scramble on his knees but Holcroft hit him another
savage blow and said Lie still

Ferguson began to wring his hands and beg for mercy His captor stood
over him a moment or two irresolutely in his whiteheated anger then
thoughts of his wife began to soften him He could not go to her with
blood on his handsshe who had taught him such lessons of forbearance
and forgiveness He put the pistol in his pocket and giving his enemy
a kick said Get up

The man rose with difficulty

I wont waste time in asking any promises from YOU but if you ever
trouble my wife or me again Ill break every bone in your body Go
quick before my mood changes and dont say a word

As the man tremblingly untied his horse Jane stepped out before him
and said Im a little idiotic girl am I

He was too thoroughly cowed to make any reply and drove as rapidly away
as the ground permitted guiding his horse with difficulty in his
maimed condition

Jane in the exuberance of her pleasure began something like a jig on
the scene of conflict and her antics were so ridiculous that Holcroft
had to turn away to repress a smile You didnt mind me Jane he
said gravely

Well sir she replied after showin you the way to im you
oughter not grudge me seein the fun

But it isnt nice for little girls to see such things

Never saw anything nicer in my life Youre the kind of man I believe
in you are Golly Only wished SHED seen you Ive seen many a
rough and tumble mong farm hands but never anything like this It
was only his pistol I was fraid of

Will you do exactly what I say now

She nodded

Well go home across the fields and dont by word or manner let Mrs
Holcroft know what youve seen or heard and say nothing about meeting
me Just make her think you know nothing at all and that you only
watched the man out of sight Do this and Ill give you a new dress

Id like somethin else sides that

Well what

Id like to be sure I could stay right on with you

Yes Jane after today as long as youre a good girl Now go for I
must get back to my team before this scamp goes by

She darted homeward as the farmer returned to his wagon Ferguson soon
appeared and seemed much startled as he saw his Nemesis again Ill
keep my word he said as he drove by

Youd better called the farmer You know what to expect now

Alida was so prostrated by the shock of the interview that she rallied
slowly At last she saw that it was getting late and that she soon
might expect the return of her husband She dragged herself to the
door and again called Jane but the place was evidently deserted
Evening was coming on tranquilly with all its sweet June sounds but
now every bird song was like a knell She sunk on the porch seat and
looked at the landscape already so dear and familiar as if she were
taking a final farewell of a friend Then she turned to the homely
kitchen to which she had first been brought I can do a little more
for him she thought before I make the last sacrifice which will
soon bring the end I think I could have livedlived perhaps till I
was old if I had gone among strangers from the almshouse but I cant
now My heart is broken Now that Ive seen that man again I
understand why my husband cannot love me Even the thought of touching
me must make him shudder But I cant bear up under such a load much
longer and thats my comfort Its best I should go away now I
couldnt do otherwise and the tragedy went on in her soul as she
feebly prepared her husbands meal

At last Jane came in with her basket of peas Her face was so
impassive as to suggest that she had no knowledge of anything except
that there had been a visitor and Alida had sunk into such depths of
despairing sorrow that she scarcely noticed the child



Chapter XXXIII

Shrink from YOU

Holcroft soon came driving slowly up the lane as if nothing unusual was
on his mind Having tied his horses he brought in an armful of
bundles and said kindly Well Alida here I am again and I guess
Ive brought enough to last well through haying time

Yes she replied with averted face This did not trouble him any
now but her extreme pallor did and he added You dont look well I
wouldnt mind getting much supper tonight Let Jane do the work

Id rather do it she replied

Oh well laughing pleasantly you shall have your own way Who has
a better right than you Id like to know

Dont speak that way she said almost harshly under the tension of
her feelings II cant stand it Speak and look as you did before
you went away

Jane said the farmer go and gather the eggs

As soon as they were alone he began gently Alida

Please dont speak so to me today Ive endured all I can I cant
keep up another minute unless you let things go on as they were
Tomorrow Ill try to tell you all Its your right

I didnt mean to say anything myself till after supper and perhaps
not till tomorrow but I think Id better It will be better for us
both and our minds will be more at rest Come with me into the
parlor Alida

Well perhaps the sooner its over the better she said faintly and
huskily

She sunk on the lounge and looked at him with such despairing eyes that
tears came into his own

Alida he began hesitatingly after I left you this noon I felt I
must speak with and be frank with you

No no she cried with an imploring gesture if it must be said
let me say it I couldnt endure to hear it from you Before you went
away I understood it all and this afternoon the truth has been burned
into my soul That horrible man has been herethe man I thought my
husbandand he has made it clearer if possible I dont blame you
that you shrink from me as if I were a leper I feel as if I were one

I shrink from YOU he exclaimed

Yes Can you think I havent seen the repugnance growing in spite of
yourself When I thought of that manespecially when he came todayI
understood WHY too well I cannot stay here any longer Youd try to
be kind and considerate but Id know how you felt all the time It
would not be safe for you and it would not be right for me to stay
either and that settles it Bebe as kind to meas you can a fewa
few hours longer and then let me go quietly Her selfcontrol gave
way and burying her face in her hands she sobbed convulsively

In a moment he was on his knees beside her with his arm about her
waist Alida dear Alida he cried weve both been in the dark
about each other What I resolved to do when I started for town was
to tell you that I had learned to love you and to throw myself on your
mercy I thought you saw I was loving you and that you couldnt bear
to think of such a thing in an old homely fellow like me That was
all that was in my mind so help me God

Butbut HES been here she faltered you dont realize

I dont believe I do or can yet Alida dear but that blessed Janes
spying trait has served me the best turn in the world She heard every
brave word you said and I shed tears of joy when she told me and tears
are slow coming to my eyes You think I shrink from you do you and
he kissed her hands passionately See he cried I kneel to you in
gratitude for all youve been to me and are to me

Oh James Please rise Its too much

No not till you promise to go with me to a minister and hear me
promise to love cherishyes in your case Ill promise to obey

She bowed her head upon his shoulder in answer Springing up he
clasped her close and kissed away her tears as he exclaimed No more
business marriage for me if you please There never was a man so in
love with his wife

Suddenly she looked up and said fearfully James he threatened you
He said youd never be safe a moment as long as I stayed here

His answer was a peal of laughter Ive done more than threaten him
Ive whipped him within an inch of his life and it was the thought of
you that led me in my rage to spare his life Ill tell you allIm
going to tell you everything now How much trouble I might have saved
if I had told you my thoughts What was there Alida in an old fellow
like me that led you to care so

Looking up shyly she replied I think it was the MAN in
youandthen you stood up for me so

Well love is blind I suppose but it dont seem to me that mine is
There never was a man so taken in at his marriage You were so
different from what I expected that I began loving you before I knew
it but I thought you were good to me just as you were to Janefrom a
sense of dutyand that you couldnt abide me personally So I tried
to keep out of your way And Alida dear I thought at first that I
was taken by your good traits and your education and all that but I
found out at last that I had fallen in love with YOU Now you know
all You feel better now dont you

Yes she breathed softly

Youve had enough to wear a saint out he continued kindly Lie down
on the lounge and Ill bring your supper to you

No please It will do me more good to go on and act as if nothing
had happened

Well have your own way little wife Youre boss now sure enough

She drew him to the porch and together they looked upon the June
landscape which she had regarded with such despairing eyes an hour
before

Happiness never kills after all she said

Shouldnt be alive if it did he replied The birds seem to sing as
if they knew

Jane emerged from the barn door with a basket of eggs and Alida sped
away to meet her The first thing the child knew the arms of her
mistress were about her neck and she was kissed again and again

What did you do that for she asked

Youll understand some day

Say said Jane in an impulse of good will if youre only half
married to Mr Holcroft Id go the whole figure fis you If youd
a seen him athrashin that scamp youd know hes the man to take
care of you

Yes Jane I know Hell take care of me always

The next morning Holcroft and Alida drove to town and went to the
church which she and her mother used to attend After the service they
followed the clergyman home where Alida again told him her story
though not without much help from the farmer After some kindly
reproach that she had not brought her troubles to him at first the
minister performed a ceremony which found deep echoes in both their
hearts

Time and right sensible living soon remove prejudice from the hearts
of the good and stop the mouths of the cynical and scandalloving
Alidas influence and the farmers broadening and more unselfish views
gradually bought him into a better understanding of his faith and into
a kinder sympathy and charity for his neighbors than he had ever known
His relations to the society of which he was a part became natural and
friendly and his house a pretty and a hospitable home Even Mrs
Watterly eventually entered its portals She and others were compelled
to agree with Watterly that Alida was not of the common sort and
that the happiest good fortune which could befall any man had come to
Holcroft when he fell in love with his wife
