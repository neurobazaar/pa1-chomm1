PART IWEST


The sun was rising in the foothills But for an hour the black mass
of Sierra eastward of Angels had been outlined with fire and the
conventional morning had come two hours before with the down coach from
Placerville The dry cold dewless California night still lingered
in the long canyons and folded skirts of Table Mountain Even on the
mountain road the air was still sharp and that urgent necessity for
something to keep out the chill which sent the barkeeper sleepily among
his bottles and wineglasses at the station obtained all along the road

Perhaps it might be said that the first stir of life was in the
barrooms A few birds twittered in the sycamores at the roadside but
long before that glasses had clicked and bottles gurgled in the saloon
of the Mansion House This was still lit by a dissipatedlooking
hanginglamp which was evidently the worse for having been up all
night and bore a singular resemblance to a faded reveller of Angels
who even then sputtered and flickered in HIS socket in an armchair
below ita resemblance so plain that when the first level sunbeam
pierced the windowpane the barkeeper moved by a sentiment of
consistency and compassion put them both out together

Then the sun came up haughtily When it had passed the eastern ridge it
began after its habit to lord it over Angels sending the thermometer
up twenty degrees in as many minutes driving the mules to the sparse
shade of corrals and fences making the red dust incandescent and
renewing its old imperious aggression on the spiked bosses of the convex
shield of pines that defended Table Mountain Thither by nine oclock
all coolness had retreated and the outsides of the up stage plunged
their hot faces in its aromatic shadows as in water

It was the custom of the driver of the Wingdam coach to whip up his
horses and enter Angels at that remarkable pace which the woodcuts in
the hotel barroom represented to credulous humanity as the usual rate
of speed of that conveyance At such times the habitual expression of
disdainful reticence and lazy official severity which he wore on the box
became intensified as the loungers gathered about the vehicle and only
the boldest ventured to address him It was the Hon Judge Beeswinger
Member of Assembly who today presumed perhaps rashly on the strength
of his official position

Any political news from below Bill he asked as the latter slowly
descended from his lofty perch without however any perceptible coming
down of mien or manner

Not much said Bill with deliberate gravity The President o the
United States heznt bin hisself sens you refoosed that seat in the
Cabinet The ginral feelin in perlitical circles is one o regret

Irony even of this outrageous quality was too common in Angels to
excite either a smile or a frown Bill slowly entered the barroom
during a dry dead silence in which only a faint spirit of emulation
survived

Ye didnt bring up that agint o Rothschilds this trip asked the
barkeeper slowly by way of vague contribution to the prevailing tone
of conversation

No responded Bill with thoughtful exactitude He said he couldnt
look inter that claim o Johnsons without first consultin the Bank o
England

The Mr Johnson here alluded to being present as the faded reveller
the barkeeper had lately put out and as the alleged claim notoriously
possessed no attractions whatever to capitalists expectation naturally
looked to him for some response to this evident challenge He did so
by simply stating that he would take sugar in his and by walking
unsteadily toward the bar as if accepting a festive invitation To the
credit of Bill be it recorded that he did not attempt to correct the
mistake but gravely touched glasses with him and after saying Heres
another nail in your coffina cheerful sentiment to which And the
hair all off your head was playfully added by the othershe threw
off his liquor with a single dexterous movement of head and elbow and
stood refreshed

Hello old major said Bill suddenly setting down his glass Are YOU
there

It was a boy who becoming bashfully conscious that this epithet was
addressed to him retreated sideways to the doorway where he stood
beating his hat against the doorpost with an assumption of indifference
that his downcast but mirthful dark eyes and reddening cheek scarcely
bore out Perhaps it was owing to his size perhaps it was to a certain
cherubic outline of face and figure perhaps to a peculiar trustfulness
of expression that he did not look half his age which was really
fourteen

Everybody in Angels knew the boy Either under the venerable title
bestowed by Bill or as Tom Islington after his adopted father his
was a familiar presence in the settlement and the theme of much local
criticism and comment His waywardness indolence and unaccountable
amiabilitya quality at once suspicious and gratuitous in a pioneer
community like Angelshad often been the subject of fierce discussion
A large and reputable majority believed him destined for the gallows a
minority not quite so reputable enjoyed his presence without troubling
themselves much about his future to one or two the evil predictions of
the majority possessed neither novelty nor terror

Anything for me Bill asked the boy half mechanically with the air
of repeating some jocular formulary perfectly understood by Bill

Anythin for you echoed Bill with an overacted severity equally well
understood by Tommyanythin for you No And its my opinion there
wont be anythin for you ez long ez you hang around barrooms and spend
your valooable time with loafers and bummers Git

The reproof was accompanied by a suitable exaggeration of gesture
Bill had seized a decanter before which the boy retreated still
goodhumoredly Bill followed him to the door Dern my skin if he
heznt gone off with that bummer Johnson he added as he looked down
the road

Whats he expectin Bill asked the barkeeper

A letter from his aunt Reckon hell hev to take it out in expectin
Likely theyre glad to get shut o him

Hes leadin a shiftless idle life here interposed the Member of
Assembly

Well said Bill who never allowed any one but himself to abuse
his protege seein he aint expectin no offis from the hands of
an enlightened constitooency it IS rayther a shiftless life After
delivering this Parthian arrow with a gratuitous twanging of the bow to
indicate its offensive personality Bill winked at the barkeeper slowly
resumed a pair of immense bulgy buckskin gloves which gave his fingers
the appearance of being painfully sore and bandaged strode to the door
without looking at anybody called out All aboard with a perfunctory
air of supreme indifference whether the invitation was heeded remounted
his box and drove stolidly away

Perhaps it was well that he did so for the conversation at once assumed
a disrespectful attitude toward Tom and his relatives It was more than
intimated that Toms alleged aunt was none other than Toms real mother
while it was also asserted that Toms alleged uncle did not himself
participate in this intimate relationship to the boy to an extent which
the fastidious taste of Angels deemed moral and necessary Popular
opinion also believed that Islington the adopted father who received
a certain stipend ostensibly for the boys support retained it as
a reward for his reticence regarding these facts He aint ruinin
hisself by wastin it on Tom said the barkeeper who possibly
possessed positive knowledge of much of Islingtons disbursements But
at this point exhausted nature languished among some of the debaters
and he turned from the frivolity of conversation to his severer
professional duties

It was also well that Bills momentary attitude of didactic propriety
was not further excited by the subsequent conduct of his protege For
by this time Tom half supporting the unstable Johnson who developed
a tendency to occasionally dash across the glaring road but checked
himself mid way each time reached the corral which adjoined the Mansion
House At its farther extremity was a pump and horsetrough Here
without a word being spoken but evidently in obedience to some habitual
custom Tom led his companion With the boys assistance Johnson
removed his coat and neckcloth turned back the collar of his shirt and
gravely placed his head beneath the pumpspout With equal gravity and
deliberation Tom took his place at the handle For a few moments
only the splashing of water and regular strokes of the pump broke the
solemnly ludicrous silence Then there was a pause in which Johnson put
his hands to his dripping head felt of it critically as if it belonged
to somebody else and raised his eyes to his companion That ought
to fetch IT said Tom in answer to the look Ef it dont replied
Johnson doggedly with an air of relieving himself of all further
responsibility in the matter its got to thets all

If it referred to some change in the physiognomy of Johnson it had
probably been fetched by the process just indicated The head that
went under the pump was large and clothed with bushy uncertaincolored
hair the face was flushed puffy and expressionless the eyes injected
and full The head that came out from under the pump was of smaller size
and different shape the hair straight dark and sleek the face
pale and hollowcheeked the eyes bright and restless In the haggard
nervous ascetic that rose from the horsetrough there was very little
trace of the Bacchus that had bowed there a moment before Familiar
as Tom must have been with the spectacle he could not help looking
inquiringly at the trough as if expecting to see some traces of the
previous Johnson in its shallow depths

A narrow strip of willow alder and buckeyea mere dusty ravelled
fringe of the green mantle that swept the high shoulders of Table
Mountainlapped the edge of the corral The silent pair were quick to
avail themselves of even its scant shelter from the overpowering sun
They had not proceeded far before Johnson who was walking quite
rapidly in advance suddenly brought himself up and turned to his
companion with an interrogative Eh

I didnt speak said Tommy quietly

Who said you spoke said Johnson with a quick look of cunning In
course you didnt speak and I didnt speak neither Nobody spoke Wot
makes you think you spoke he continued peering curiously into Tommys
eyes

The smile which habitually shone there quickly vanished as the boy
stepped quietly to his companions side and took his arm without a
word

In course you didnt speak Tommy said Johnson deprecatingly You
aint a boy to go for to play an ole soaker like me Thats wot I like
you for Thets wot I seed in you from the first I sez Thet ere boy
aint goin to play you Johnson You can go your whole pile on him
when you cant trust even a barkeep Thets wot I said Eh

This time Tommy prudently took no notice of the interrogation and
Johnson went on Ef I was to ask you another question you wouldnt go
to play me neitherwould you Tommy

No said the boy

Ef I was to ask you continued Johnson without heeding the reply but
with a growing anxiety of eye and a nervous twitching of his lipsef
I was to ask you fur instance ef that was a jackass rabbit thet jest
passedehyoud say it was or was not ez the case may be You
wouldnt play the ole man on thet

No said Tommy quietly it WAS a jackass rabbit

Ef I was to ask you continued Johnson ef it wore say fur
instance a green hat with yaller ribbons you wouldnt play me and say
it did onlesshe added with intensified cunningonless it DID

No said Tommy of course I wouldnt but then you see IT DID

It did

It did repeated Tommy stoutly a green hat with yellow
ribbonsandanda red rosette

I didnt get to see the rosette said Johnson with slow and
conscientious deliberation yet with an evident sense of relief but
that aint sayin it warnt there you know Eh

Tommy glanced quietly at his companion There were great beads of
perspiration on his ashengray forehead and on the ends of his lank
hair the hand which twitched spasmodically in his was cold and clammy
the other which was free had a vague purposeless jerky activity as
if attached to some deranged mechanism Without any apparent concern in
these phenomena Tommy halted and seating himself on a log motioned
his companion to a place beside him Johnson obeyed without a word
Slight as was the act perhaps no other incident of their singular
companionship indicated as completely the dominance of this careless
halfeffeminate but selfpossessed boy over this doggedly selfwilled
abnormally excited man

It aint the square thing said Johnson after a pause with a laugh
that was neither mirthful nor musical and frightened away a lizard that
had been regarding the pair with breathless suspenseit aint the
square thing for jackass rabbits to wear hats Tommyis it eh

Well said Tommy with unmoved composure sometimes they do and
sometimes they dont Animals are mighty queer And here Tommy went
off in an animated but I regret to say utterly untruthful and
untrustworthy account of the habits of California fauna until he was
interrupted by Johnson

And snakes eh Tommy said the man with an abstracted air gazing
intently on the ground before him

And snakes said Tommy but they dont bite at least not that kind
you see Theredont move Uncle Ben dont move theyre gone now
And its about time you took your dose

Johnson had hurriedly risen as if to leap upon the log but Tommy had
as quickly caught his arm with one hand while he drew a bottle from his
pocket with the other Johnson paused and eyed the bottle Ef you say
so my boy he faltered as his fingers closed nervously around it say
when then He raised the bottle to his lips and took a long draught
the boy regarding him critically When said Tommy suddenly Johnson
started flushed and returned the bottle quickly But the color that
had risen to his cheek stayed there his eye grew less restless and
as they moved away again the hand that rested on Tommys shoulder was
steadier

Their way lay along the flank of Table Mountaina wandering trail
through a tangled solitude that might have seemed virgin and unbroken
but for a few oystercans yeastpowder tins and empty bottles that had
been apparently stranded by the first low wash of pioneer waves
On the ragged trunk of an enormous pine hung a few tufts of gray hair
caught from a passing grizzly but in strange juxtaposition at its foot
lay an empty bottle of incomparable bittersthe chefdoeuvre of a
hygienic civilization and blazoned with the arms of an allhealing
republic The head of a rattlesnake peered from a case that had
contained tobacco which was still brightly placarded with the
highcolored effigy of a popular danseuse And a little beyond this the
soil was broken and fissured there was a confused mass of roughly hewn
timber a straggling line of sluicing a heap of gravel and dirt a rude
cabin and the claim of Johnson

Except for the rudest purposes of shelter from rain and cold the cabin
possessed but little advantage over the simple savagery of surrounding
nature It had all the practical directness of the habitation of some
animal without its comfort or picturesque quality the very birds that
haunted it for food must have felt their own superiority as architects
It was inconceivably dirty even with its scant capacity for accretion
it was singularly stale even in its newness and freshness of material
Unspeakably dreary as it was in shadow the sunlight visited it in
a blind aching purposeless way as if despairing of mellowing its
outlines or of even tanning it into color

The claim worked by Johnson in his intervals of sobriety was represented
by half a dozen rude openings in the mountainside with the heapedup
debris of rock and gravel before the mouth of each They gave very
little evidence of engineering skill or constructive purpose or indeed
showed anything but the vague successively abandoned essays of their
projector Today they served another purpose for as the sun had heated
the little cabin almost to the point of combustion curling up the long
dry shingles and starting aromatic tears from the green pine beams
Tommy led Johnson into one of the larger openings and with a sense of
satisfaction threw himself panting upon its rocky floor Here and there
the grateful dampness was condensed in quiet pools of water or in
a monotonous and soothing drip from the rocks above Without lay the
staring sunlightcolorless clarified intense

For a few moments they lay resting on their elbows in blissful
contemplation of the heat they had escaped Wot do you say said
Johnson slowly without looking at his companion but abstractly
addressing himself to the landscape beyondwot do you say to two
straight games fur one thousand dollars

Make it five thousand replied Tommy reflectively also to the
landscape and Im in

Wot do I owe you now said Johnson after a lengthened silence

One hundred and seventyfive thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
replied Tommy with businesslike gravity

Well said Johnson after a deliberation commensurate with the
magnitude of the transaction ef you win call it a hundred and eighty
thousand round Wars the keerds

They were in an old tin box in a crevice of a rock above his head They
were greasy and worn with service Johnson dealt albeit his right hand
was still uncertainhovering after dropping the cards aimlessly
about Tommy and being only recalled by a strong nervous effort Yet
notwithstanding this incapacity for even honest manipulation Mr
Johnson covertly turned a knave from the bottom of the pack with such
shameless inefficiency and gratuitous unskilfulness that even Tommy was
obliged to cough and look elsewhere to hide his embarrassment Possibly
for this reason the young gentleman was himself constrained by way of
correction to add a valuable card to his own hand over and above the
number he legitimately held

Nevertheless the game was unexciting and dragged listlessly Johnson
won He recorded the fact and the amount with a stub of pencil and
shaking fingers in wandering hieroglyphics all over a pocket diary
Then there was a long pause when Johnson slowly drew something from his
pocket and held it up before his companion It was apparently a dull
red stone

Ef said Johnson slowly with his old look of simple cunningef
you happened to pick up sich a rock ez that Tommy what might you say
it was

Dont know said Tommy

Mightnt you say continued Johnson cautiously that it was gold or
silver

Neither said Tommy promptly

Mightnt you say it was quicksilver Mightnt you say that ef thar was
a friend o yourn ez knew war to go and turn out ten ton of it a day
and every ton worth two thousand dollars that he had a soft thing a
very soft thingallowin Tommy that you used sich language which
you dont

But said the boy coming to the point with great directness DO you
know where to get it have you struck it Uncle Ben

Johnson looked carefully around I hev Tommy Listen I know whar
thars cartloads of it But thars only one other specimenthe mate to
this yerthets above ground and thets in Frisco Thars an agint
comin up in a day or two to look into it I sent for him Eh

His bright restless eyes were concentrated on Tommys face now but the
boy showed neither surprise nor interest Least of all did he betray
any recollection of Bills ironical and gratuitous corroboration of this
part of the story

Nobody knows it continued Johnson in a nervous whispernobody
knows it but you and the agint in Frisco The boys workin round yar
passes by and sees the old man grubbin away and no signs o color not
even rotten quartz the boys loafin round the Mansion House sees the
old man lyin round free in barrooms and they laughs and sez Played
out and spects nothin Maybe ye think they spects suthin now eh
queried Johnson suddenly with a sharp look of suspicion

Tommy looked up shook his head threw a stone at a passing rabbit but
did not reply

When I fust set eyes on you Tommy continued Johnson apparently
reassured the fust day you kem and pumped for me an entire stranger
and hevin no call to do it I sez Johnson Johnson sez I yers a
boy you kin trust Yers a boy that wont play you yers a chap thats
white and squarewhite and square Tommy thems the very words I
used

He paused for a moment and then went on in a confidential whisper
You want capital Johnson sez I to develop your resources and
you want a pardner Capital you can send for but your pardner
Johnsonyour pardner is right yer And his name it is Tommy
Islington Thems the very words I used

He stopped and chafed his clammy hands upon his knees Its six months
ago sens I made you my pardner Thar aint a lick Ive struck sens
then Tommy thar aint a hanful o yearth Ive washed thar aint
a shovelful o rock Ive turned over but I thot o you Share and
share alike sez I When I wrote to my agint I wrote ekal for my
pardner Tommy Islington he hevin no call to know ef the same was man
or boy

He had moved nearer the boy and would perhaps have laid his hand
caressingly upon him but even in his manifest affection there was
a singular element of awed restraint and even feara suggestion of
something withheld even his fullest confidences a hopeless perception
of some vague barrier that never could be surmounted He may have been
at times dimly conscious that in the eyes which Tommy raised to his
there was thorough intellectual appreciation critical goodhumor even
feminine softness but nothing more His nervousness somewhat heightened
by his embarrassment he went on with an attempt at calmness which his
twitching white lips and unsteady fingers made pathetically grotesque
Thars a bill o sale in my bunk made out accordin to law of an ekal
ondivided half of the claim and the consideration is two hundred and
fifty thousand dollarsgambling debtsgambling debts from me to you
Tommyyou understandnothing could exceed the intense cunning of
his eye at this momentand then thars a will

A will said Tommy in amused surprise

Johnson looked frightened

Eh he said hurriedly wot will Who said anythin bout a will
Tommy

Nobody replied Tommy with unblushing calm

Johnson passed his hand over his cold forehead wrung the damp ends of
his hair with his fingers and went on Times when Im took bad ez I
was today the boys about yer sezyou sez maybe Tommyits whiskey
It aint Tommy Its pizenquicksilver pizen Thats whats the
matter with me Im salviated Salviated with merkery

Ive heerd o it before continued Johnson appealing to the boy and
ez a boy o permiskus reading I reckon you hev too Them men as works
in cinnabar sooner or later gets salviated Its bound to fetch em some
time Salviated by merkery

What are you goin to do for it asked Tommy

When the agint comes up and I begins to realize on this yer mine
said Johnson contemplatively I goes to New York I sez to the
barkeep o the hotel Show me the biggest doctor here He shows me
I sez to him Salviated by merkerya years standinhow much He
sez Five thousand dollars and take two o these pills at bedtime and
an ekil number o powders at meals and come back in a week And I goes
back in a week cured and signs a certifikit to that effect

Encouraged by a look of interest in Tommys eye he went on

So I gets cured I goes to the barkeep and I sez Show me the
biggest fashionblest house thets for sale yer And he sez The
biggest natrally blongs to John Jacob Astor And I sez Show him
and he shows him And I sez Wot might you ask for this yer house And
he looks at me scornful and sez Go way old man you must be sick
And I fetches him one over the left eye and he apologizes and I gives
him his own price for the house I stocks that house with mohogany
furniture and pervisions and thar we lives you and me Tommy you and
me

The sun no longer shone upon the hillside The shadows of the pines were
beginning to creep over Johnsons claim and the air within the cavern
was growing chill In the gathering darkness his eyes shone brightly
as he went on Then thar comes a day when we gives a big spread We
invites govners members o Congress gentlemen o fashion and the
like And among em I invites a Man as holds his head very high a Man I
once knew but he doesnt know I knows him and he doesnt remember me
And he comes and he sits opposite me and I watches him And hes very
airy this Man and very chipper and he wipes his mouth with a white
hankercher and he smiles and he ketches my eye And he sez A glass
o wine with you Mr Johnson and he fills his glass and I fills mine
and we rises And I heaves that wine glass and all right into his
damned grinnin face And he jumps for mefor he is very game this
Man very gamebut some on em grabs him and he sez Who be you
And I sez Skaggs damn you Skaggs Look at me Gimme back my wife and
child gimme back the money you stole gimme back the good name you
took away gimme back the health you ruined gimme back the last twelve
years Give em to me damn you quick before I cuts your heart out
And naterally Tommy he cant do it And so I cuts his heart out my
boy I cuts his heart out

The purely animal fury of his eye suddenly changed again to cunning
You think they hangs me for it Tommy but they dont Not much Tommy
I goes to the biggest lawyer there and I says to him Salviated by
merkeryyou hear mesalviated by merkery And he winks at me
and he goes to the judge and he sez This yer unfortnet man isnt
responsiblehes been salviated by merkery And he brings witnesses
you comes Tommy and you sez ez how youve seen me took bad afore and
the doctor he comes and he sez as how hes seen me frightful and the
jury without leavin their seats brings in a verdict o justifiable
insanitysalviated by merkery

In the excitement of his climax he had risen to his feet but would have
fallen had not Tommy caught him and led him into the open air In
this sharper light there was an odd change visible in his yellowwhite
facea change which caused Tommy to hurriedly support him half
leading half dragging him toward the little cabin When they had
reached it Tommy placed him on a rude bunk or shelf and stood for
a moment in anxious contemplation of the tremorstricken man before him
Then he said rapidly Listen Uncle Ben Im goin to townto town
you understandfor the doctor Youre not to get up or move on any
account until I return Do you hear Johnson nodded violently Ill be
back in two hours In another moment he was gone

For an hour Johnson kept his word Then he suddenly sat up and began
to gaze fixedly at a corner of the cabin From gazing at it he began to
smile from smiling at it he began to talk from talking at it he began
to scream from screaming he passed to cursing and sobbing wildly Then
he lay quiet again

He was so still that to merely human eyes he might have seemed asleep
or dead But a squirrel that emboldened by the stillness had entered
from the roof stopped short upon a beam above the bunk for he saw that
the mans foot was slowly and cautiously moving toward the floor and
that the mans eyes were as intent and watchful as his own Presently
still without a sound both feet were upon the floor And then the bunk
creaked and the squirrel whisked into the eaves of the roof When he
peered forth again everything was quiet and the man was gone

An hour later two muleteers on the Placerville Road passed a man with
dishevelled hair glaring bloodshot eyes and clothes torn with bramble
and stained with the red dust of the mountain They pursued him when
he turned fiercely on the foremost wrested a pistol from his grasp and
broke away Later still when the sun had dropped behind Paynes Ridge
the underbrush on Deadwood Slope crackled with a stealthy but continuous
tread It must have been an animal whose dimly outlined bulk in the
gathering darkness showed here and there in vague but incessant
motion it could be nothing but an animal whose utterance was at once
so incoherent monotonous and unremitting Yet when the sound came
nearer and the chaparral was parted it seemed to be a man and that
man Johnson

Above the baying of phantasmal hounds that pressed him hard and drove
him on with never rest or mercy above the lashing of a spectral whip
that curled about his limbs sang in his ears and continually stung him
forward above the outcries of the unclean shapes that thronged about
himhe could still distinguish one real soundthe rush and sweep of
hurrying waters The Stanislaus River A thousand feet below him drove
its yellowing current Through all the vacillations of his unseated mind
he had clung to one ideato reach the river to lave in it to swim it
if need be but to put it forever between him and the harrying shapes
to drown forever in its turbid depths the thronging spectres to wash
away in its yellow flood all stains and color of the past And now he
was leaping from boulder to boulder from blackened stump to stump
from gnarled bush to bush caught for a moment and withheld by clinging
vines or plunging downward into dusty hollows until rolling
dropping sliding and stumbling he reached the riverbank whereon
he fell rose staggered forward and fell again with outstretched arms
upon a rock that breasted the swift current And there he lay as dead

A few stars came out hesitatingly above Deadwood Slope A cold wind that
had sprung up with the going down of the sun fanned them into momentary
brightness swept the heated flanks of the mountain and ruffled the
river Where the fallen man lay there was a sharp curve in the stream
so that in the gathering shadows the rushing water seemed to leap out of
the darkness and to vanish again Decayed driftwood trunks of trees
fragments of broken sluicingthe wash and waste of many a mileswept
into sight a moment and were gone All of decay wreck and foulness
gathered in the long circuit of miningcamp and settlement all the
dregs and refuse of a crude and wanton civilization reappeared for an
instant and then were hurried away in the darkness and lost No wonder
that as the wind ruffled the yellow waters the waves seemed to lift
their unclean hands toward the rock whereon the fallen man lay as if
eager to snatch him from it too and hurry him toward the sea

It was very still In the clear air a horn blown a mile away was heard
distinctly The jingling of a spur and a laugh on the highway over
Paynes Ridge sounded clearly across the river The rattling of harness
and hoofs foretold for many minutes the approach of the Wingdam coach
that at last with flashing lights passed within a few feet of the
rock Then for an hour all again was quiet Presently the moon round
and full lifted herself above the serried ridge and looked down upon
the river At first the bared peak of Deadwood Hill gleamed white and
skulllike Then the shadows of Paynes Ridge cast on the slope slowly
sank away leaving the unshapely stumps the dusty fissures and
clinging outcrop of Deadwood Slope to stand out in black and silver
Still stealing softly downward the moonlight touched the bank and the
rock and then glittered brightly on the river The rock was bare and
the man was gone but the river still hurried swiftly to the sea


Is there anything for me asked Tommy Islington as a week after
the stage drew up at the Mansion House and Bill slowly entered the
barroom Bill did not reply but turning to a stranger who had entered
with him indicated with a jerk of his finger the boy The stranger
turned with an air half of business half of curiosity and looked
critically at Tommy Is there anything for me repeated Tommy a
little confused at the silence and scrutiny Bill walked deliberately
to the bar and placing his back against it faced Tommy with a look of
demure enjoyment

Ef he remarked slowlyef a hundred thousand dollars down and half
a million in perspektive is ennything Major THERE IS

PART IIEAST


It was characteristic of Angels that the disappearance of Johnson and
the fact that he had left his entire property to Tommy thrilled the
community but slightly in comparison with the astounding discovery that
he had anything to leave The finding of a cinnabar lode at Angels
absorbed all collateral facts or subsequent details Prospectors from
adjoining camps thronged the settlement the hillside for a mile on
either side of Johnsons claim was staked out and preempted trade
received a sudden stimulus and in the excited rhetoric of the Weekly
Record a new era had broken upon Angels On Thursday last added
that paper over five hundred dollars was taken in over the bar of the
Mansion House

Of the fate of Johnson there was little doubt He had been last seen
lying on a boulder on the riverbank by outside passengers of the
Wingdam night coach and when Finn of Robinsons Ferry admitted to have
fired three shots from a revolver at a dark object struggling in the
water near the ferry which he suspicioned to be a bear the question
seemed to be settled Whatever might have been the fallibility of
his judgment of the accuracy of his aim there could be no doubt The
general belief that Johnson after possessing himself of the muleteers
pistol could have run amuck gave a certain retributive justice to this
story which rendered it acceptable to the camp

It was also characteristic of Angels that no feeling of envy or
opposition to the good fortune of Tommy Islington prevailed there That
he was thoroughly cognizant from the first of Johnsons discovery
that his attentions to him were interested calculating and speculative
was however the general belief of the majoritya belief that
singularly enough awakened the first feelings of genuine respect for
Tommy ever shown by the camp He aint no fool Yuba Bill seed thet
from the first said the barkeeper It was Yuba Bill who applied for
the guardianship of Tommy after his accession to Johnsons claim and on
whose bonds the richest men of Calaveras were represented It was
Yuba Bill also when Tommy was sent East to finish his education
accompanied him to San Francisco and before parting with his charge on
the steamers deck drew him aside and said Ef at enny time you want
enny money Tommy over and bove your lowance you kin write but ef
youll take my advice he added with a sudden huskiness mitigating
the severity of his voice youll forget every derned ole spavined
stringhalted bummer as you ever met or knew at Angelsevry one
Tommyevry one And soboytake care of yourselfandand God
bless ye and pertikerly dn me for a firstclass A 1 fool It was
Yuba Bill also after this speech glared savagely around walked down
the crowded gangplank with a rigid and aggressive shoulder picked a
quarrel with his cabman and after bundling that functionary into his
own vehicle took the reins himself and drove furiously to his hotel
It cost me said Bill recounting the occurrence somewhat later at
Angelsit cost me a matter o twenty dollars afore the jedge the
next mornin but you kin bet high thet I taught them Frisco chaps
suthin new about drivin I didnt make it lively in Montgomery Street
for about ten minutesO no

And so by degrees the two original locaters of the great Cinnabar lode
faded from the memory of Angels and Calaveras knew them no more In
five years their very names had been forgotten in seven the name of the
town was changed in ten the town itself was transported bodily to the
hillside and the chimney of the Union Smelting Works by night flickered
like a corpselight over the site of Johnsons cabin and by day
poisoned the pure spices of the pines Even the Mansion House was
dismantled and the Wingdam stage deserted the highway for a shorter cut
by Quicksilver City Only the bared crest of Deadwood Hill as of
old sharply cut the clear blue sky and at its base as of old the
Stanislaus River unwearied and unresting babbled whispered and
hurried away to the sea


A midsummers day was breaking lazily on the Atlantic There was not
wind enough to move the vapors in the foggy offing but where the vague
distance heaved against a violet sky there were dull red streaks that
growing brighter presently painted out the stars Soon the brown rocks
of Greyport appeared faintly suffused and then the whole ashen line of
dead coast was kindled and the lighthouse beacons went out one by one
And then a hundred sail before invisible started out of the vapory
horizon and pressed toward the shore It was morning indeed and some
of the best society in Greyport having been up all night were thinking
it was time to go to bed

For as the sky flashed brighter it fired the clustering red roofs of
a picturesque house by the sands that had all that night from open
lattice and illuminated balcony given light and music to the shore
It glittered on the broad crystal spaces of a great conservatory that
looked upon an exquisite lawn where all night long the blended odors
of sea and shore had swooned under the summer moon But it wrought
confusion among the colored lamps on the long veranda and startled
a group of ladies and gentlemen who had stepped from the drawingroom
window to gaze upon it It was so searching and sincere in its way
that as the carriage of the fairest Miss Gillyflower rolled away that
peerless young woman catching sight of her face in the oval mirror
instantly pulled down the blinds and nestling the whitest shoulders in
Greyport against the crimson cushions went to sleep

How haggard everybody is Rose dear you look almost intellectual
said Blanche Masterman

I hope not said Rose simply Sunrises are very trying Look how
that pink regularly puts out Mrs BrownRobinson hair and all

The angels said the Count de Nugat with a polite gesture toward
the sky must have find these celestial combinations very bad for the
toilette

Theyre safe in whiteexcept when they sit for their pictures in
Venice said Blanche How fresh Mr Islington looks Its really
uncomplimentary to us

I suppose the sun recognizes in me no rival said the young man
demurely But he added I have lived much in the open air and
require very little sleep

How delightful said Mrs BrownRobinson in a low enthusiastic
voice and a manner that held the glowing sentiment of sixteen and the
practical experiences of thirtytwo in dangerous combinationhow
perfectly delightful What sunrises you must have seen and in such
wild romantic places How I envy you My nephew was a classmate of
yours and has often repeated to me those charming stories you tell of
your adventures Wont you tell some now Do How you must tire of us
and this artificial life here so frightfully artificial you know in
a confidential whisper and then to think of the days when you roamed
the great West with the Indians and the bisons and the grizzly bears
Of course you have seen grizzly bears and bisons

Of course he has dear said Blanche a little pettishly throwing
a cloak over her shoulders and seizing her chaperon by the arm his
earliest infancy was soothed by bisons and he proudly points to the
grizzly bear as the playmate of his youth Come with me and Ill tell
you all about it How good it is of you she added sotto voce to
Islington as he stood by the carriagehow perfectly good it is of
you to be like those animals you tell us of and not know your full
power Think with your experiences and our credulity what stories you
MIGHT tell And you are going to walk Good night then A slim gloved
hand was frankly extended from the window and the next moment the
carriage rolled away

Isnt Islington throwing away a chance there said Captain Merwin on
the veranda

Perhaps he couldnt stand my lovely aunts superadded presence But
then hes the guest of Blanches father and I dare say they see enough
of each other as it is

But isnt it a rather dangerous situation

For him perhaps although hes awfully old and very queer For
her with an experience that takes in all the available men in both
hemispheres ending with Nugat over there I should say a man more or
less wouldnt affect her much anyway Of course he laughed these
are the accents of bitterness But that was last year

Perhaps Islington did not overhear the speaker perhaps if he did the
criticism was not new He turned carelessly away and sauntered out
on the road to the sea Thence he strolled along the sands toward the
cliffs where meeting an impediment in the shape of a garden wall he
leaped it with a certain agile boyish ease and experience and struck
across an open lawn toward the rocks again The best society of Greyport
were not early risers and the spectacle of a trespasser in an evening
dress excited only the criticism of grooms hanging about the stables or
cleanly housemaids on the broad verandas that in Greyport architecture
dutifully gave upon the sea Only once as he entered the boundaries of
Cliffwood Lodge the famous seat of Renwyck Masterman was he aware of
suspicious scrutiny but a slouching figure that vanished quickly in the
lodge offered no opposition to his progress Avoiding the pathway to
the lodge Islington kept along the rocks until reaching a little
promontory and rustic pavilion he sat down and gazed upon the sea

And presently an infinite peace stole upon him Except where the waves
lapped lazily the crags below the vast expanse beyond seemed unbroken
by ripple heaving only in broad ponderable sheets and rhythmically as
if still in sleep The air was filled with a luminous haze that caught
and held the direct sunbeams In the deep calm that lay upon the sea it
seemed to Islington that all the tenderness of culture magic of wealth
and spell of refinement that for years had wrought upon that favored
shore had extended its gracious influence even here What a pampered and
caressed old ocean it was cajoled flattered and feted where it lay
An odd recollection of the turbid Stanislaus hurrying by the ascetic
pines of the grim outlines of Deadwood Hill swam before his eyes
and made the yellow green of the velvet lawn and graceful foliage seem
almost tropical by contrast And looking up a few yards distant he
beheld a tall slip of a girl gazing upon the seaBlanche Masterman

She had plucked somewhere a large fanshaped leaf which she held
parasolwise shading the blond masses of her hair and hiding her gray
eyes She had changed her festal dress with its amplitude of flounce
and train for a closely fitting halfantique habit whose scant outlines
would have been trying to limbs less shapely but which prettily
accented the graceful curves and sweeping lines of this Greyport
goddess As Islington rose she came toward him with a frankly
outstretched hand and unconstrained manner Had she observed him first
I dont know

They sat down together on a rustic seat Miss Blanche facing the sea
and shading her eyes with the leaf

I dont really know how long I have been sitting here said Islington
or whether I have not been actually asleep and dreaming It seemed too
lovely a morning to go to bed But you

From behind the leaf it appeared that Miss Blanche on retiring had
been pursued by a hideous winged bug which defied the efforts of herself
and maid to dislodge Odin the Spitz dog had insisted upon scratching
at the door And it made her eyes red to sleep in the morning And she
had an early call to make And the sea looked lovely

Im glad to find you here whatever be the cause said Islington with
his old directness Today as you know is my last day in Greyport
and it is much pleasanter to say good by under this blue sky than even
beneath your fathers wonderful frescos yonder I want to remember you
too as part of this pleasant prospect which belongs to us all rather
than recall you in anybodys particular setting

I know said Blanche with equal directness that houses are one of
the defects of our civilization but I dont think I ever heard the idea
as elegantly expressed before Where do you go

I dont know yet I have several plans I may go to South America and
become president of one of the republicsI am not particular which I
am rich but in that part of America which lies outside of Greyport it
is necessary for every man to have some work My friends think I
should have some great aim in life with a capital A But I was born a
vagabond and a vagabond I shall probably die

I dont know anybody in South America said Blanche languidly There
were two girls here last season but they didnt wear stays in the
house and their white frocks never were properly done up If you go to
South America you must write to me

I will Can you tell me the name of this flower which I found in your
greenhouse It looks much like a California blossom

Perhaps it is Father bought it of a halfcrazy old man who came here
one day Do you know him

Islington laughed I am afraid not But let me present this in a less
businesslike fashion

Thank you Remind me to give you one in return before you goor will
you choose yourself

They had both risen as by a common instinct

Good by

The cool flowerlike hand lay in his for an instant

Will you oblige me by putting aside that leaf a moment before I go

But my eyes are red and I look like a perfect fright

Yet after a long pause the leaf fluttered down and a pair of very
beautiful but withal very clear and critical eyes met his Islington was
constrained to look away When he turned again she was gone

Mister Hislingtonsir

It was Chalker the English groom out of breath with running

Seein you alone sirbeg your pardon sirbut theres a person

A person what the devil do you mean Speak Englishno damn it I
mean dont said Islington snappishly

I sed a person sir Beg pardonno offencebut not a gent sir In
the libry

A little amused even through the utter dissatisfaction with himself
and vague loneliness that had suddenly come upon him Islington as he
walked toward the lodge asked Why isnt he a gent

No gentbeggin your pardin sirud guy a man in sarvis sir Takes
me ands so sir as I sits in the rumble at the gate and puts em
downd so sir and sez Put em in your pocket young manor is it
a road agint you expects to see that you olds hup your ands hand
crosses em like to that sez he Old ard sez he on the short
curves or youll bust your precious crust sez he And hasks for you
sir This way sir

They entered the lodge Islington hurried down the long Gothic hall and
opened the library door

In an armchair in the centre of the room a man sat apparently
contemplating a large stiff yellow hat with an enormous brim that
was placed on the floor before him His hands rested lightly between his
knees but one foot was drawn up at the side of his chair in a peculiar
manner In the first glance that Islington gave the attitude in some
odd irreconcilable way suggested a brake In another moment he dashed
across the room and holding out both hands cried Yuba Bill

The man rose caught Islington by the shoulders wheeled him round
hugged him felt of his ribs like a goodnatured ogre shook his hands
violently laughed and then said somewhat ruefully And how ever did
you know me

Seeing that Yuba Bill evidently regarded himself as in some elaborate
disguise Islington laughed and suggested that it must have been
instinct

And you said Bill holding him at arms length and surveying him
criticallyyoutoe thinktoe thinka little cuss no higher nor a
trace a boy as Ive flicked outer the road with a whip time in agin a
boy ez never hed much clothes to speak of turned into a sport

Islington remembered with a thrill of ludicrous terror that he still
wore his evening dress

Turned continued Yuba Bill severelyturned into a restyourant
waitera garsong Eh Alfonse bring me a patty de foy grass and an
omelette demme

Dear old chap said Islington laughing and trying to put his
hand over Bills bearded mouth but youYOU dont look exactly like
yourself Youre not well Bill And indeed as he turned toward the
light Bills eyes appeared cavernous and his hair and beard thickly
streaked with gray

Maybe its this yer harness said Bill a little anxiously When I
hitches on this yer curb he indicated a massive gold watchchain with
enormous links and mounts this morning star he pointed to a very
large solitaire pin which had the appearance of blistering his whole
shirtfront it kinder weighs heavy on me Tommy Otherwise Im all
right my boyall right But he evaded Islingtons keen eye and
turned from the light

You have something to tell me Bill said Islington suddenly and
with almost brusque directness out with it

Bill did not speak but moved uneasily toward his hat

You didnt come three thousand miles without a word of warning to
talk to me of old times said Islington more kindly glad as I would
have been to see you It isnt your way Bill and you know it We shall
not be disturbed here he added in reply to an inquiring glance that
Bill directed to the door and I am ready to hear you

Firstly then said Bill drawing his chair nearer Islington answer
me one question Tommy fair and square and up and down

Go on said Islington with a slight smile

Ef I should say to you Tommysay to you today right here you must
come with meyou must leave this place for a month a year two years
maybe perhaps foreveris there anything that ud keep youanything
my boy ez you couldnt leave

No said Tommy quietly I am only visiting here I thought of
leaving Greyport today

But if I should say to you Tommy come with me on a pasear to Chiny
to Japan to South Ameriky praps could you go

Yes said Islington after a slight pause

Thar isnt ennything said Bill drawing a little closer and lowering
his voice confidentiallyennything in the way of a young womanyou
understand Tommyez would keep you Theyre mighty sweet about here
and whether a man is young or old Tommy theres always some woman as
is brake or whip to him

In a certain excited bitterness that characterized the delivery of
this abstract truth Bill did not see that the young mans face flushed
slightly as he answered No

Then listen Its seven years ago Tommy thet I was working one o
the Pioneer coaches over from Gold Hill Ez I stood in front o the
stageoffice the sheriff o the county comes to me and he sez Bill
sez he Ive got a looney chap as Im in charge of taking im down to
the sylum in Stockton Hez quiet and peaceable but the insides dont
like to ride with him Hev you enny objection to give him a lift on the
box beside you I sez No put him up When I came to go and get up
on that box beside him that man Tommythat man sittin there quiet
and peaceable wasJohnson

He didnt know me my boy Yuba Bill continued rising and putting his
hands on Tommys shouldershe didnt know me He didnt know nothing
about you nor Angels nor the quicksilver lode nor even his own name
He said his name was Skaggs but I knowd it was Johnson Thar was times
Tommy you might have knocked me off that box with a feather thar
was times when if the twentyseven passengers o that stage hed found
theirselves swimming in the American River five hundred feet below
the road I never could have explained it satisfactorily to the
companynever

The sheriff said Bill continued hastily as if to preclude any
interruption from the young manthe sheriff said he had been
brought into Murphys Camp three years before dripping with water and
sufferin from perkussion of the brain and had been cared for generally
by the boys round When I told the sheriff I knowed im I got him to
leave him in my care and I took him to Frisco Tommy to Frisco
and I put him in charge o the best doctors there and paid his board
myself There was nothin he didnt have ez he wanted Dont look that
way my dear boy for Gods sake dont

O Bill said Islington rising and staggering to the window why did
you keep this from me

Why said Bill turning on him savagelywhy because I warnt a
fool Thar was you winnin your way in college thar was YOU risin in
the world and of some account to it yer was an old bummer ez good ez
dead to ita man ez oughter been dead afore a man ez never denied it
But you allus liked him better nor me said Bill bitterly

Forgive me Bill said the young man seizing both his hands I know
you did it for the best but go on

Thar aint much more to tell nor much use to tell it as I can see
said Bill moodily He never could be cured the doctors said for he
had what they called monomaniawas always talking about his wife and
darter that somebody had stole away years ago and plannin revenge
on that somebody And six months ago he was missed I tracked him to
Carson to Salt Lake City to Omaha to Chicago to New Yorkand
here

Here echoed Islington

Here And thats what brings me here today Whethers hes crazy or
well whethers hes huntin you or lookin up that other man you must
get away from here You mustnt see him You and me Tommy will go away
on a cruise In three or four years hell be dead or missing and then
well come back Come And he rose to his feet

Bill said Islington rising also and taking the hand of his friend
with the same quiet obstinacy that in the old days had endeared him to
Bill wherever he is here or elsewhere sane or crazy I shall seek
and find him Every dollar that I have shall be his every dollar that I
have spent shall be returned to him I am young yet thank God and can
work and if there is a way out of this miserable business I shall find
it

I knew said Bill with a surliness that ill concealed his evident
admiration of the calm figure before himI knew the partikler style
of dn fool that you was and expected no better Good by thenGod
Almighty whos that

He was on his way to the open French window but had started back his
face quite white and bloodless and his eyes staring Islington ran to
the window and looked out A white skirt vanished around the corner of
the veranda When he returned Bill had dropped into a chair

It must have been Miss Masterman I think but whats the matter

Nothing said Bill faintly have you got any whiskey handy

Islington brought a decanter and pouring out some spirits handed the
glass to Bill Bill drained it and then said Who is Miss Masterman

Mr Mastermans daughter that is an adopted daughter I believe

Wot name

I really dont know said Islington pettishly more vexed than he
cared to own at this questioning

Yuba Bill rose and walked to the window closed it walked back again
to the door glanced at Islington hesitated and then returned to his
chair

I didnt tell you I was marrieddid I he said suddenly looking up
in Islingtons face with an unsuccessful attempt at a reckless laugh

No said Islington more pained at the manner than the words

Fact said Yuba Bill Three years ago it was Tommythree years
ago

He looked so hard at Islington that feeling he was expected to say
something he asked vaguely Who did you marry

Thets it said Yuba Bill I cant ezactly say partikly though a
she devil generally the wife of half a dozen other men

Accustomed apparently to have his conjugal infelicities a theme of
mirth among men and seeing no trace of amusement on Islingtons grave
face his dogged reckless manner softened and drawing his chair
closer to Islington he went on It all began outer this we was coming
down Watsons grade one night pretty free when the expressman turns to
me and sez Theres a row inside and youd better pull up I pulls
up and out hops first a woman and then two or three chaps swearing
and cursin and tryin to drag some one arter them Then it peard
Tommy thet it was this womans drunken husband they was going to put
out for abusin her and strikin her in the coach and if it hadnt
been for me my boy theyd hev left that chap thar in the road But I
fixes matters up by putting her alongside o me on the box and we drove
on She was very white Tommyfor the matter o that she was always
one o these very white women that never got red in the facebut she
never cried a whimper Most wimin would have cried It was queer but
she never cried I thought so at the time

She was very tall with a lot o light hair meandering down the back of
her head as long as a deerskin whiplash and about the color She hed
eyes thetd bore you through at fifty yards and pooty hands and feet
And when she kinder got out o that stiff narvous state she was in and
warmed up a little and got chipper by Gd sir she was handsomeshe
was that

A little flushed and embarrassed at his own enthusiasm he stopped and
then said carelessly They got off at Murphys

Well said Islington

Well I used to see her often arter thet and when she was alone she
allus took the boxseat She kinder confided her troubles to me how her
husband got drunk and abused her and I didnt see much o him for
he was away in Frisco arter thet But it was all square Tommyall
square twixt me and her

I got a going there a good deal and then one day I sez to myself
Bill this wont do and I got changed to another route Did you ever
know Jackson Filltree Tommy said Bill breaking off suddenly

No

Might have heerd of him praps

No said Islington impatiently

Jackson Filltree ran the express from Whites out to Summit cross the
North Fork of the Yuba One day he sez to me Bill thats a mighty bad
ford at the North Fork I sez I believe you Jackson Itll git
me some day Bill sure sez he I sez Why dont you take the lower
ford I dont know sez he but I cant So ever after when I
met him he sez That North Fork aint got me yet One day I was in
Sacramento and up comes Filltree He sez Ive sold out the express
business on account of the North Fork but its bound to get me yet
Bill sure and he laughs Two weeks after they finds his body below
the ford whar he tried to cross comin down from the Summit way Folks
said it was foolishness Tommy I sez it was Fate The second day arter
I was changed to the Placerville route thet woman comes outer the
hotel above the stageoffice Her husband she said was lying sick in
Placerville thats what she said but it was Fate Tommy Fate Three
months afterward her husband takes an overdose of morphine for delirium
tremems and dies Theres folks ez sez she gave it to him but its
Fate A year after that I married herFate Tommy Fate

I lived with her jest three months he went on after a long
breaththree months It aint much time for a happy man Ive seen
a good deal o hard life in my day but there was days in that three
months longer than any day in my lifedays Tommy when it was a
tossup whether I should kill her or she me But thar Im done You are
a young man Tommy and I aint goin to tell things thet old as I am
three years ago I couldnt have believed

When at last with his grim face turned toward the window he sat
silently with his clinched hands on his knees before him Islington
asked where his wife was now

Ask me no more my boyno more Ive said my say With a gesture as
of throwing down a pair of reins before him he rose and walked to the
window

You kin understand Tommy why a little trip around the world ud do me
good Ef you cant go with me well and good But go I must

Not before luncheon I hope said a very sweet voice as Blanche
Masterman suddenly stood before them Father would never forgive me if
in his absence I permitted one of Mr Islingtons friends to go in this
way You will stay wont you Do And you will give me your arm now
and when Mr Islington has done staring he will follow us into the
diningroom and introduce you


I have quite fallen in love with your friend said Miss Blanche as
they stood in the drawingroom looking at the figure of Bill strolling
with his short pipe in his mouth through the distant shrubbery He
asks very queer questions though He wanted to know my mothers maiden
name

He is an honest fellow said Islington gravely

You are very much subdued You dont thank me I dare say for keeping
you and your friend here but you couldnt go you know until father
returned

Islington smiled but not very gayly

And then I think it much better for us to part here under these
frescos dont you Good by

She extended her long slim hand

Out in the sunlight there when my eyes were red you were very anxious
to look at me she added in a dangerous voice

Islington raised his sad eyes to hers Something glittering upon her own
sweet lashes trembled and fell

Blanche

She was rosy enough now and would have withdrawn her hand but
Islington detained it She was not quite certain but that her waist
was also in jeopardy Yet she could not help saying Are you sure that
there isnt anything in the way of a young woman that would keep you

Blanche said Islington in reproachful horror

If gentlemen will roar out their secrets before an open window with
a young woman lying on a sofa on the veranda reading a stupid French
novel they must not be surprised if she gives more attention to them
than her book

Then you know all Blanche

I know said Blanche lets seeI know the partiklar style
ofahemfool you was and expected no better Good by And gliding
like a lovely and innocent milk snake out of his grasp she slipped
away


To the pleasant ripple of waves the sound of music and light voices
the yellow midsummer moon again rose over Greyport It looked upon
formless masses of rock and shrubbery wide spaces of lawn and beach
and a shimmering expanse of water It singled out particular objectsa
white sail in shore a crystal globe upon the lawn and flashed upon
something held between the teeth of a crouching figure scaling the low
wall of Cliffwood Lodge Then as a man and woman passed out from under
the shadows of the foliage into the open moonlight of the garden path
the figure leaped from the wall and stood erect and waiting in the
shadow

It was the figure of an old man with rolling eyes his trembling hand
grasping a long keen knifea figure more pitiable than pitiless more
pathetic than terrible But the next moment the knife was stricken from
his hand and he struggled in the firm grasp of another figure that
apparently sprang from the wall beside him

Dn you Masterman cried the old man hoarsely give me fair play
and Ill kill you yet

Which my name is Yuba Bill said Bill quietly and its time this
dn fooling was stopped

The old man glared in Bills face savagely I know you Youre one
of Mastermans friendsdn youlet me go till I cut his heart
outlet me go Where is my Marywhere is my wifethere she is
theretherethere Mary He would have screamed but Bill placed
his powerful hand upon his mouth as he turned in the direction of the
old mans glance Distinct in the moonlight the figures of Islington and
Blanche arm in arm stood out upon the garden path

Give me my wife muttered the old man hoarsely between Bills
fingers Where is she

A sudden fury passed over Yuba Bills face Where is your wife he
echoed pressing the old man back against the garden wall and holding
him there as in a vice Where is your wife he repeated thrusting his
grim sardonic jaw and savage eyes into the old mans frightened face
Where is Jack Adams wife Where is MY wife Where is the shedevil
that drove one man mad that sent another to hell by his own hand that
eternally broke and ruined me Where Where Do you ask where In
jail in Sacramentoin jail do you hearin jail for murder
Johnsonmurder

The old man gasped stiffened and then relaxing suddenly slipped
a mere inanimate mass at Yuba Bills feet With a sudden revulsion of
feeling Yuba Bill dropped at his side and lifting him tenderly in
his arms whispered Look up old man Johnson look up for
Gods sakeits meYuba Bill and yonder is your daughter
andTommydont you knowTommy little Tommy Islington

Johnsons eyes slowly opened He whispered Tommy yes Tommy Sit by
me Tommy But dont sit so near the bank Dont you see how the river
is rising and beckoning to mehissing and boilin over the rocks
Its gittin higherhold me Tommyhold me and dont let me go yet
Well live to cut his heart out Tommywell livewell His head
sank and the rushing river invisible to all eyes save his leaped
toward him out of the darkness and bore him away no longer to the
darkness but through it to the distant peaceful shining sea




HOW SANTA CLAUS CAME TO SIMPSONS BAR


It had been raining in the valley of the Sacramento The North Fork
had overflowed its banks and Rattlesnake Creek was impassable The few
boulders that had marked the summer ford at Simpsons Crossing were
obliterated by a vast sheet of water stretching to the foothills The up
stage was stopped at Grangers the last mail had been abandoned in the
tules the rider swimming for his life An area remarked the
Sierra Avalanche with pensive local pride as large as the State of
Massachusetts is now under water

Nor was the weather any better in the foothills The mud lay deep on the
mountain road wagons that neither physical force nor moral objurgation
could move from the evil ways into which they had fallen encumbered the
track and the way to Simpsons Bar was indicated by brokendown teams
and hard swearing And farther on cut off and inaccessible rained
upon and bedraggled smitten by high winds and threatened by high water
Simpsons Bar on the eve of Christmas day 1862 clung like a swallows
nest to the rocky entablature and splintered capitals of Table Mountain
and shook in the blast

As night shut down on the settlement a few lights gleamed through
the mist from the windows of cabins on either side of the highway now
crossed and gullied by lawless streams and swept by marauding winds
Happily most of the population were gathered at Thompsons store
clustered around a redhot stove at which they silently spat in some
accepted sense of social communion that perhaps rendered conversation
unnecessary Indeed most methods of diversion had long since been
exhausted on Simpsons Bar high water had suspended the regular
occupations on gulch and on river and a consequent lack of money and
whiskey had taken the zest from most illegitimate recreation Even Mr
Hamlin was fain to leave the Bar with fifty dollars in his pocketthe
only amount actually realized of the large sums won by him in the
successful exercise of his arduous profession Ef I was asked he
remarked somewhat lateref I was asked to pint out a purty little
village where a retired sport as didnt care for money could exercise
hisself frequent and lively Id say Simpsons Bar but for a young man
with a large family depending on his exertions it dont pay As Mr
Hamlins family consisted mainly of female adults this remark is quoted
rather to show the breadth of his humor than the exact extent of his
responsibilities

Howbeit the unconscious objects of this satire sat that evening in the
listless apathy begotten of idleness and lack of excitement Even the
sudden splashing of hoofs before the door did not arouse them Dick
Bullen alone paused in the act of scraping out his pipe and lifted
his head but no other one of the group indicated any interest in or
recognition of the man who entered

It was a figure familiar enough to the company and known in Simpsons
Bar as The Old Man A man of perhaps fifty years grizzled and scant
of hair but still fresh and youthful of complexion A face full of
ready but not very powerful sympathy with a chameleonlike aptitude
for taking on the shade and color of contiguous moods and feelings He
had evidently just left some hilarious companions and did not at first
notice the gravity of the group but clapped the shoulder of the nearest
man jocularly and threw himself into a vacant chair

Jest heard the best thing out boys Ye know Smiley over yarJim
Smileyfunniest man in the Bar Well Jim was jest telling the richest
yarn about

Smileys a  fool interrupted a gloomy voice

A particular  skunk added another in sepulchral accents

A silence followed these positive statements The Old Man glanced
quickly around the group Then his face slowly changed Thats so
he said reflectively after a pause certingly a sort of a skunk and
suthin of a fool In course He was silent for a moment as in painful
contemplation of the unsavoriness and folly of the unpopular Smiley
Dismal weather aint it he added now fully embarked on the current
of prevailing sentiment Mighty rough papers on the boys and no show
for money this season And tomorrows Christmas

There was a movement among the men at this announcement but whether of
satisfaction or disgust was not plain Yes continued the Old Man in
the lugubrious tone he had within the last few moments unconsciously
adoptedyes Christmas and tonights Christmas eve Ye see boys
I kinder thoughtthat is I sorter had an idee jest passin like you
knowthat may be yed all like to come over to my house tonight and
have a sort of tear round But I suppose now you wouldnt Dont feel
like it may be he added with anxious sympathy peering into the faces
of his companions

Well I dont know responded Tom Flynn with some cheerfulness
Praps we may But how about your wife Old Man What does SHE say to
it

The Old Man hesitated His conjugal experience had not been a happy one
and the fact was known to Simpsons Bar His first wife a delicate
pretty little woman had suffered keenly and secretly from the jealous
suspicions of her husband until one day he invited the whole Bar to his
house to expose her infidelity On arriving the party found the shy
petite creature quietly engaged in her household duties and retired
abashed and discomfited But the sensitive woman did not easily recover
from the shock of this extraordinary outrage It was with difficulty
she regained her equanimity sufficiently to release her lover from the
closet in which he was concealed and escape with him She left a boy of
three years to comfort her bereaved husband The Old Mans present wife
had been his cook She was large loyal and aggressive

Before he could reply Joe Dimmick suggested with great directness that
it was the Old Mans house and that invoking the Divine Power if
the case were his own he would invite whom he pleased even if in
so doing he imperilled his salvation The Powers of Evil he further
remarked should contend against him vainly All this delivered with a
terseness and vigor lost in this necessary translation

In course Certainly Thets it said the Old Man with a sympathetic
frown Thars no trouble about THET Its my own house built every
stick on it myself Dont you be afeard o her boys She MAY cut up a
trifle roughez wimmin dobut shell come round Secretly the Old
Man trusted to the exaltation of liquor and the power of courageous
example to sustain him in such an emergency

As yet Dick Bullen the oracle and leader of Simpsons Bar had not
spoken He now took his pipe from his lips Old Man hows that yer
Johnny gettin on Seems to me he didnt look so peart last time I seed
him on the bluff heavin rocks at Chinamen Didnt seem to take much
interest in it Thar was a gang of em by yar yesterdaydrownded out
up the riverand I kinder thought o Johnny and how hed miss em
May be now wed be in the way ef he wus sick

The father evidently touched not only by this pathetic picture of
Johnnys deprivation but by the considerate delicacy of the speaker
hastened to assure him that Johnny was better and that a little fun
might liven him up Whereupon Dick arose shook himself and saying
Im ready Lead the way Old Man here goes himself led the way with
a leap a characteristic howl and darted out into the night As he
passed through the outer room he caught up a blazing brand from the
hearth The action was repeated by the rest of the party closely
following and elbowing each other and before the astonished proprietor
of Thompsons grocery was aware of the intention of his guests the room
was deserted

The night was pitchy dark In the first gust of wind their temporary
torches were extinguished and only the red brands dancing and flitting
in the gloom like drunken willothewisps indicated their whereabouts
Their way led up PineTree Canyon at the head of which a broad low
barkthatched cabin burrowed in the mountainside It was the home of
the Old Man and the entrance to the tunnel in which he worked when
he worked at all Here the crowd paused for a moment out of delicate
deference to their host who came up panting in the rear

Praps yed better hold on a second out yer whilst I go in and see
thet things is all right said the Old Man with an indifference he
was far from feeling The suggestion was graciously accepted the
door opened and closed on the host and the crowd leaning their backs
against the wall and cowering under the eaves waited and listened

For a few moments there was no sound but the dripping of water from the
eaves and the stir and rustle of wrestling boughs above them Then the
men became uneasy and whispered suggestion and suspicion passed from
the one to the other Reckon shes caved in his head the first lick
Decoyed him inter the tunnel and barred him up likely Got him down
and sittin on him Probly bilin suthin to heave on us stand clear
the door boys For just then the latch clicked the door slowly
opened and a voice said Come in out o the wet

The voice was neither that of the Old Man nor of his wife It was the
voice of a small boy its weak treble broken by that preternatural
hoarseness which only vagabondage and the habit of premature
selfassertion can give It was the face of a small boy that looked up
at theirsa face that might have been pretty and even refined but
that it was darkened by evil knowledge from within and dirt and hard
experience from without He had a blanket around his shoulders and had
evidently just risen from his bed Come in he repeated and dont
make no noise The Old Mans in there talking to mar he continued
pointing to an adjacent room which seemed to be a kitchen from which
the Old Mans voice came in deprecating accents Let me be he added
querulously to Dick Bullen who had caught him up blanket and all and
was affecting to toss him into the fire let go o me you dd old
fool dye hear

Thus adjured Dick Bullen lowered Johnny to the ground with a smothered
laugh while the men entering quietly ranged themselves around a long
table of rough boards which occupied the centre of the room Johnny then
gravely proceeded to a cupboard and brought out several articles which
he deposited on the table Thars whiskey And crackers And red
herons And cheese He took a bite of the latter on his way to the
table And sugar He scooped up a mouthful en route with a small and
very dirty hand And terbacker Thars dried appils too on the shelf
but I dont admire em Appils is swellin Thar he concluded now
wade in and dont be afeard I dont mind the old woman She dont
blong to ME Slong

He had stepped to the threshold of a small room scarcely larger than a
closet partitioned off from the main apartment and holding in its dim
recess a small bed He stood there a moment looking at the company his
bare feet peeping from the blanket and nodded

Hello Johnny You aint goin to turn in agin are ye said Dick

Yes I are responded Johnny decidedly

Why wots up old fellow

Im sick

How sick

Ive got a fevier And childblains And roomatiz returned Johnny
and vanished within After a moments pause he added in the dark
apparently from under the bedclothesAnd biles

There was an embarrassing silence The men looked at each other and at
the fire Even with the appetizing banquet before them it seemed as if
they might again fall into the despondency of Thompsons grocery when
the voice of the Old Man incautiously lifted came deprecatingly from
the kitchen

Certainly Thets so In course they is A gang o lazy drunken
loafers and that ar Dick Bullens the ornariest of all Didnt hev
no more sabe than to come round yar with sickness in the house and no
provision Thets what I said Bullen sez I its crazy drunk you
are or a fool sez I to think o such a thing Staples I sez
be you a man Staples and spect to raise hll under my roof and
invalids lyin round But they would comethey would Thets wot you
must spect o such trash as lays round the Bar

A burst of laughter from the men followed this unfortunate exposure
Whether it was overheard in the kitchen or whether the Old Mans irate
companion had just then exhausted all other modes of expressing her
contemptuous indignation I cannot say but a back door was suddenly
slammed with great violence A moment later and the Old Man reappeared
haply unconscious of the cause of the late hilarious outburst and
smiled blandly

The old woman thought shed jest run over to Mrs McFaddens for a
sociable call he explained with jaunty indifference as he took a
seat at the board

Oddly enough it needed this untoward incident to relieve the
embarrassment that was beginning to be felt by the party and their
natural audacity returned with their host I do not propose to record
the convivialities of that evening The inquisitive reader will accept
the statement that the conversation was characterized by the same
intellectual exaltation the same cautious reverence the same
fastidious delicacy the same rhetorical precision and the same logical
and coherent discourse somewhat later in the evening which distinguish
similar gatherings of the masculine sex in more civilized localities and
under more favorable auspices No glasses were broken in the absence of
any no liquor was uselessly spilt on floor or table in the scarcity of
that article

It was nearly midnight when the festivities were interrupted Hush
said Dick Bullen holding up his hand It was the querulous voice of
Johnny from his adjacent closet O dad

The Old Man arose hurriedly and disappeared in the closet Presently he
reappeared His rheumatiz is coming on agin bad he explained and
he wants rubbin He lifted the demijohn of whiskey from the table
and shook it It was empty Dick Bullen put down his tin cup with
an embarrassed laugh So did the others The Old Man examined their
contents and said hopefully I reckon thats enough he dont need
much You hold on all o you for a spell and Ill be back and
vanished in the closet with an old flannel shirt and the whiskey The
door closed but imperfectly and the following dialogue was distinctly
audible

Now Sonny whar does she ache worst

Sometimes over yar and sometimes under yer but its most powerful from
yer to yer Rub yer dad

A silence seemed to indicate a brisk rubbing Then Johnny

Hevin a good time out yer dad

Yes sonny

Tomorrers Chrismiss aint it

Yes Sonny How does she feel now

Better rub a little furder down Wots Chrismiss anyway Wots it all
about

O its a day

This exhaustive definition was apparently satisfactory for there was a
silent interval of rubbing Presently Johnny again

Mar sez that everywhere else but yer everybody gives things to
everybody Chrismiss and then she jist waded inter you She sez thars
a man they call Sandy Claws not a white man you know but a kind o
Chinemin comes down the chimbley night afore Chrismiss and gives things
to chillernboys like me Puts em in their butes Thets what she
tried to play upon me Easy now pop whar are you rubbin tothets
a mile from the place She jest made that up didnt she jest to
aggrewate me and you Dont rub thar    Why dad

In the great quiet that seemed to have fallen upon the house the sigh
of the near pines and the drip of leaves without was very distinct
Johnnys voice too was lowered as he went on Dont you take on now
fur Im gettin all right fast Wots the boys doin out thar

The Old Man partly opened the door and peered through His guests were
sitting there sociably enough and there were a few silver coins and a
lean buckskin purse on the table Bettin on suthinsome little game
or nother Theyre all right he replied to Johnny and recommenced
his rubbing

Id like to take a hand and win some money said Johnny reflectively
after a pause

The Old Man glibly repeated what was evidently a familiar formula that
if Johnny would wait until he struck it rich in the tunnel hed have
lots of money etc etc

Yes said Johnny but you dont And whether you strike it or I win
it its about the same Its all luck But its mighty curos about
Chrismissaint it Why do they call it Chrismiss

Perhaps from some instinctive deference to the overhearing of his
guests or from some vague sense of incongruity the Old Mans reply was
so low as to be inaudible beyond the room

Yes said Johnny with some slight abatement of interest Ive heerd
o HIM before Thar thatll do dad I dont ache near so bad as I did
Now wrap me tight in this yer blanket So Now he added in a muffled
whisper sit down yer by me till I go asleep To assure himself of
obedience he disengaged one hand from the blanket and grasping his
fathers sleeve again composed himself to rest

For some moments the Old Man waited patiently Then the unwonted
stillness of the house excited his curiosity and without moving from
the bed he cautiously opened the door with his disengaged hand and
looked into the main room To his infinite surprise it was dark and
deserted But even then a smouldering log on the hearth broke and by
the upspringing blaze he saw the figure of Dick Bullen sitting by the
dying embers

Hello

Dick started rose and came somewhat unsteadily toward him

Whars the boys said the Old Man

Gone up the canyon on a little pasear Theyre coming back for me in a
minit Im waitin round for em What are you starin at Old Man he
added with a forced laugh do you think Im drunk

The Old Man might have been pardoned the supposition for Dicks eyes
were humid and his face flushed He loitered and lounged back to the
chimney yawned shook himself buttoned up his coat and laughed
Liquor aint so plenty as that Old Man Now dont you git up he
continued as the Old Man made a movement to release his sleeve from
Johnnys hand Dont you mind manners Sit jest whar you be Im goin
in a jiffy Thar thats them now

There was a low tap at the door Dick Bullen opened it quickly nodded
Good night to his host and disappeared The Old Man would have
followed him but for the hand that still unconsciously grasped his
sleeve He could have easily disengaged it it was small weak and
emaciated But perhaps because it WAS small weak and emaciated he
changed his mind and drawing his chair closer to the bed rested his
head upon it In this defenceless attitude the potency of his earlier
potations surprised him The room flickered and faded before his eyes
reappeared faded again went out and left himasleep

Meantime Dick Bullen closing the door confronted his companions Are
you ready said Staples Ready said Dick whats the time Past
twelve was the reply can you make itits nigh on fifty miles the
round trip hither and yon I reckon returned Dick shortly Whars
the mare Bill and Jacks holdin her at the crossin Let em hold
on a minit longer said Dick

He turned and reentered the house softly By the light of the guttering
candle and dying fire he saw that the door of the little room was open
He stepped toward it on tiptoe and looked in The Old Man had fallen
back in his chair snoring his helpless feet thrust out in a line with
his collapsed shoulders and his hat pulled over his eyes Beside him
on a narrow wooden bedstead lay Johnny muffled tightly in a blanket
that hid all save a strip of forehead and a few curls damp with
perspiration Dick Bullen made a step forward hesitated and glanced
over his shoulder into the deserted room Everything was quiet With
a sudden resolution he parted his huge mustaches with both hands and
stooped over the sleeping boy But even as he did so a mischievous
blast lying in wait swooped down the chimney rekindled the hearth
and lit up the room with a shameless glow from which Dick fled in
bashful terror

His companions were already waiting for him at the crossing Two of them
were struggling in the darkness with some strange misshapen bulk which
as Dick came nearer took the semblance of a great yellow horse

It was the mare She was not a pretty picture From her Roman nose to
her rising haunches from her arched spine hidden by the stiff machillas
of a Mexican saddle to her thick straight bony legs there was not a
line of equine grace In her halfblind but wholly vicious white eyes
in her protruding under lip in her monstrous color there was nothing
but ugliness and vice

Now then said Staples stand clar of her heels boys and up with
you Dont miss your first holt of her mane and mind ye get your off
stirrup QUICK Ready

There was a leap a scrambling struggle a bound a wild retreat of the
crowd a circle of flying hoofs two springless leaps that jarred the
earth a rapid play and jingle of spurs a plunge and then the voice of
Dick somewhere in the darkness All right

Dont take the lower road back onless youre hard pushed for time
Dont hold her in down hill Well be at the ford at five Glang
Hoopa Mula GO

A splash a spark struck from the ledge in the road a clatter in the
rocky cut beyond and Dick was gone



Sing O Muse the ride of Richard Bullen Sing O Muse of chivalrous
men the sacred quest the doughty deeds the battery of low churls the
fearsome ride and grewsome perils of the Flower of Simpsons Bar Alack
she is dainty this Muse She will have none of this bucking brute and
swaggering ragged rider and I must fain follow him in prose afoot

It was one oclock and yet he had only gained Rattlesnake Hill For
in that time Jovita had rehearsed to him all her imperfections and
practised all her vices Thrice had she stumbled Twice had she thrown
up her Roman nose in a straight line with the reins and resisting bit
and spur struck out madly across country Twice had she reared and
rearing fallen backward and twice had the agile Dick unharmed
regained his seat before she found her vicious legs again And a mile
beyond them at the foot of a long hill was Rattlesnake Creek Dick
knew that here was the crucial test of his ability to perform his
enterprise set his teeth grimly put his knees well into her flanks
and changed his defensive tactics to brisk aggression Bullied and
maddened Jovita began the descent of the hill Here the artful Richard
pretended to hold her in with ostentatious objurgation and wellfeigned
cries of alarm It is unnecessary to add that Jovita instantly ran away
Nor need I state the time made in the descent it is written in the
chronicles of Simpsons Bar Enough that in another moment as it seemed
to Dick she was splashing on the overflowed banks of Rattlesnake Creek
As Dick expected the momentum she had acquired carried her beyond the
point of balking and holding her well together for a mighty leap they
dashed into the middle of the swiftly flowing current A few moments
of kicking wading and swimming and Dick drew a long breath on the
opposite bank

The road from Rattlesnake Creek to Red Mountain was tolerably level
Either the plunge in Rattlesnake Creek had dampened her baleful fire
or the art which led to it had shown her the superior wickedness of
her rider for Jovita no longer wasted her surplus energy in wanton
conceits Once she bucked but it was from force of habit once she
shied but it was from a new freshly painted meetinghouse at the
crossing of the county road Hollows ditches gravelly deposits
patches of freshly springing grasses flew from beneath her rattling
hoofs She began to smell unpleasantly once or twice she coughed
slightly but there was no abatement of her strength or speed By two
oclock he had passed Red Mountain and begun the descent to the plain
Ten minutes later the driver of the fast Pioneer coach was overtaken and
passed by a man on a Pinto hossan event sufficiently notable for
remark At half past two Dick rose in his stirrups with a great shout
Stars were glittering through the rifted clouds and beyond him out of
the plain rose two spires a flagstaff and a straggling line of black
objects Dick jingled his spurs and swung his riata Jovita bounded
forward and in another moment they swept into Tuttleville and drew up
before the wooden piazza of The Hotel of All Nations

What transpired that night at Tuttleville is not strictly a part of this
record Briefly I may state however that after Jovita had been
handed over to a sleepy ostler whom she at once kicked into unpleasant
consciousness Dick sallied out with the barkeeper for a tour of
the sleeping town Lights still gleamed from a few saloons and
gamblinghouses but avoiding these they stopped before several
closed shops and by persistent tapping and judicious outcry roused
the proprietors from their beds and made them unbar the doors of their
magazines and expose their wares Sometimes they were met by curses but
oftener by interest and some concern in their needs and the interview
was invariably concluded by a drink It was three oclock before
this pleasantry was given over and with a small waterproof bag of
indiarubber strapped on his shoulders Dick returned to the hotel But
here he was waylaid by BeautyBeauty opulent in charms affluent in
dress persuasive in speech and Spanish in accent In vain she repeated
the invitation in Excelsior happily scorned by all Alpineclimbing
youth and rejected by this child of the Sierrasa rejection softened
in this instance by a laugh and his last gold coin And then he sprang
to the saddle and dashed down the lonely street and out into the
lonelier plain where presently the lights the black line of houses
the spires and the flagstaff sank into the earth behind him again and
were lost in the distance

The storm had cleared away the air was brisk and cold the outlines of
adjacent landmarks were distinct but it was half past four before Dick
reached the meetinghouse and the crossing of the county road To avoid
the rising grade he had taken a longer and more circuitous road in
whose viscid mud Jovita sank fetlock deep at every bound It was a
poor preparation for a steady ascent of five miles more but Jovita
gathering her legs under her took it with her usual blind unreasoning
fury and a halfhour later reached the long level that led to
Rattlesnake Creek Another halfhour would bring him to the creek He
threw the reins lightly upon the neck of the mare chirruped to her and
began to sing

Suddenly Jovita shied with a bound that would have unseated a less
practised rider Hanging to her rein was a figure that had leaped from
the bank and at the same time from the road before her arose a
shadowy horse and rider Throw up your hands commanded this second
apparition with an oath

Dick felt the mare tremble quiver and apparently sink under him He
knew what it meant and was prepared

Stand aside Jack Simpson I know you you dd thief Let me pass
or

He did not finish the sentence Jovita rose straight in the air with a
terrific bound throwing the figure from her bit with a single shake
of her vicious head and charged with deadly malevolence down on the
impediment before her An oath a pistolshot horse and highwayman
rolled over in the road and the next moment Jovita was a hundred
yards away But the good right arm of her rider shattered by a bullet
dropped helplessly at his side

Without slacking his speed he shifted the reins to his left hand But a
few moments later he was obliged to halt and tighten the saddlegirths
that had slipped in the onset This in his crippled condition took some
time He had no fear of pursuit but looking up he saw that the eastern
stars were already paling and that the distant peaks had lost their
ghostly whiteness and now stood out blackly against a lighter sky Day
was upon him Then completely absorbed in a single idea he forgot
the pain of his wound and mounting again dashed on toward Rattlesnake
Creek But now Jovitas breath came broken by gasps Dick reeled in his
saddle and brighter and brighter grew the sky

Ride Richard run Jovita linger O day

For the last few rods there was a roaring in his ears Was it exhaustion
from loss of blood or what He was dazed and giddy as he swept down
the hill and did not recognize his surroundings Had he taken the wrong
road or was this Rattlesnake Creek

It was But the brawling creek he had swam a few hours before had risen
more than doubled its volume and now rolled a swift and resistless
river between him and Rattlesnake Hill For the first time that night
Richards heart sank within him The river the mountain the quickening
east swam before his eyes He shut them to recover his selfcontrol In
that brief interval by some fantastic mental process the little room
at Simpsons Bar and the figures of the sleeping father and son rose
upon him He opened his eyes wildly cast off his coat pistol boots
and saddle bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders grasped
the bare flanks of Jovita with his bared knees and with a shout dashed
into the yellow water A cry rose from the opposite bank as the head
of a man and horse struggled for a few moments against the battling
current and then were swept away amidst uprooted trees and whirling
driftwood



The Old Man started and woke The fire on the hearth was dead the
candle in the outer room flickering in its socket and somebody was
rapping at the door He opened it but fell back with a cry before the
dripping halfnaked figure that reeled against the doorpost

Dick

Hush Is he awake yet

Nobut Dick

Dry up you old fool Get me some whiskey QUICK The Old Man flew and
returned withan empty bottle Dick would have sworn but his strength
was not equal to the occasion He staggered caught at the handle of the
door and motioned to the Old Man

Thars suthin in my pack yer for Johnny Take it off I cant

The Old Man unstrapped the pack and laid it before the exhausted man

Open it quick

He did so with trembling fingers It contained only a few poor
toyscheap and barbaric enough goodness knows but bright with paint
and tinsel One of them was broken another I fear was irretrievably
ruined by water and on the thirdah me there was a cruel spot

It dont look like much thats a fact said Dick ruefully    
But its the best we could do    Take em Old Man and put em in
his stocking and tell himtell him you knowhold me Old Man The
Old Man caught at his sinking figure Tell him said Dick with a weak
little laughtell him Sandy Claus has come


And even so bedraggled ragged unshaven and unshorn with one arm
hanging helplessly at his side Santa Claus came to Simpsons Bar and
fell fainting on the first threshold The Christmas dawn came slowly
after touching the remoter peaks with the rosy warmth of ineffable
love And it looked so tenderly on Simpsons Bar that the whole mountain
as if caught in a generous action blushed to the skies




THE PRINCESS BOB AND HER FRIENDS


She was a Klamath Indian Her title was I think a compromise between
her claim as daughter of a chief and gratitude to her earliest white
protector whose name after the Indian fashion she had adopted Bob
Walker had taken her from the breast of her dead mother at a time when
the sincere volunteer soldiery of the California frontier were impressed
with the belief that extermination was the manifest destiny of the
Indian race He had with difficulty restrained the noble zeal of his
compatriots long enough to convince them that the exemption of one
Indian baby would not invalidate this theory And he took her to his
homea pastoral clearing on the banks of the Salmon Riverwhere she
was cared for after a frontier fashion

Before she was nine years old she had exhausted the scant kindliness of
the thin overworked Mrs Walker As a playfellow of the young Walkers
she was unreliable as a nurse for the baby she was inefficient She
lost the former in the trackless depths of a redwood forest she basely
abandoned the latter in an extemporized cradle hanging like a chrysalis
to a convenient bough She lied and she stoletwo unpardonable sins
in a frontier community where truth was a necessity and provisions were
the only property Worse than this the outskirts of the clearing
were sometimes haunted by blanketed tatterdemalions with whom she
had mysterious confidences Mr Walker more than once regretted his
indiscreet humanity but she presently relieved him of responsibility
and possibly of bloodguiltiness by disappearing entirely

When she reappeared it was at the adjacent village of Logport in
the capacity of housemaid to a traders wife who joining some little
culture to considerable conscientiousness attempted to instruct her
charge But the Princess proved an unsatisfactory pupil to even so
liberal a teacher She accepted the alphabet with great goodhumor
but always as a pleasing and recurring novelty in which all interest
expired at the completion of each lesson She found a thousand uses
for her books and writing materials other than those known to civilized
children She made a curious necklace of bits of slatepencil she
constructed a miniature canoe from the pasteboard covers of her primer
she bent her pens into fishhooks and tattooed the faces of her
younger companions with blue ink Religious instruction she received as
goodhumoredly and learned to pronounce the name of the Deity with
a cheerful familiarity that shocked her preceptress Nor could her
reverence be reached through analogy she knew nothing of the Great
Spirit and professed entire ignorance of the Happy HuntingGrounds
Yet she attended divine service regularly and as regularly asked for a
hymnbook and it was only through the discovery that she had collected
twentyfive of these volumes and had hidden them behind the woodpile
that her connection with the First Baptist Church of Logport ceased She
would occasionally abandon these civilized and Christian privileges and
disappear from her home returning after several days of absence with an
odor of bark and fish and a peaceoffering to her mistress in the shape
of venison or game

To add to her troubles she was now fourteen and according to the laws
of her race a woman I do not think the most romantic fancy would have
called her pretty Her complexion defied most of those ambiguous similes
through which poets unconsciously apologize for any deviation from the
Caucasian standard It was not wine nor amber colored if anything it
was smoky Her face was tattooed with red and white lines on one cheek
as if a duotoothed comb had been drawn from cheekbone to jaw and but
for the goodhumor that beamed from her small berrylike eyes and shone
in her white teeth would have been repulsive She was short and stout
In her scant drapery and unrestrained freedom she was hardly statuesque
and her more unstudied attitudes were marred by a simian habit of softly
scratching her left ankle with the toes of her right foot in moments of
contemplation

I think I have already shown enough to indicate the incongruity of her
existence with even the low standard of civilization that obtained
at Logport in the year 1860 It needed but one more fact to prove the
farsighted poetical sagacity and prophetic ethics of those sincere
advocates of extermination to whose virtues I have done but scant
justice in the beginning of this article This fact was
presently furnished by the Princess After one of her periodical
disappearancesthis time unusually prolongedshe astonished Logport
by returning with a halfbreed baby of a week old in her arms That
night a meeting of the hardfeatured serious matrons of Logport was held
at Mrs Browns The immediate banishment of the Princess was demanded
Softhearted Mrs Brown endeavored vainly to get a mitigation or
suspension of the sentence But as on a former occasion the Princess
took matters into her own hands A few mornings afterwards a wicker
cradle containing an Indian baby was found hanging on the handle of
the door of the First Baptist Church It was the Parthian arrow of the
flying Princess From that day Logport knew her no more


It had been a bright clear day on the upland so clear that the ramparts
of Fort Jackson and the flagstaff were plainly visible twelve miles away
from the long curving peninsula that stretched a bared white arm around
the peaceful waters of Logport Bay It had been a clear day upon the
seashore albeit the air was filled with the flying spume and shifting
sand of a straggling beach whose low dunes were dragged down by the long
surges of the Pacific and thrown up again by the tumultuous tradewinds
But the sun had gone down in a bank of fleecy fog that was beginning to
roll in upon the beach Gradually the headland at the entrance of the
harbor and the lighthouse disappeared then the willow fringe that
marked the line of Salmon River vanished and the ocean was gone A
few sails still gleamed on the waters of the bay but the advancing
fog wiped them out one by one crept across the steelblue expanse
swallowed up the white mills and single spire of Logport and joining
with reinforcements from the marshes moved solemnly upon the hills Ten
minutes more and the landscape was utterly blotted out simultaneously
the wind died away and a deathlike silence stole over sea and shore
The faint clang high overhead of unseen brent the nearer call of
invisible plover the lap and wash of undistinguishable waters and the
monotonous roll of the vanished ocean were the only sounds As night
deepened the faroff booming of the fogbell on the headland at
intervals stirred the thick air

Hard by the shore of the bay and half hidden by a drifting sandhill
stood a low nondescript structure to whose composition sea and shore
had equally contributed It was built partly of logs and partly of
driftwood and tarred canvas Joined to one end of the main buildingthe
ordinary logcabin of the settlerwas the halfround pilothouse of
some wrecked steamer while the other gable terminated in half of a
broken whaleboat Nailed against the boat were the dried skins of wild
animals and scattered about lay the flotsam and jetsam of many years
gatheringbamboo crates casks hatches blocks oars boxes part of
a whales vertebrae and the blades of swordfish Drawn up on the beach
of a little cove before the house lay a canoe As the night thickened
and the fog grew more dense these details grew imperceptible and only
the windows of the pilothouse lit up by a roaring fire within the hut
gleamed redly through the mist

By this fire beneath a ships lamp that swung from the roof two
figures were seated a man and a woman The man broadshouldered and
heavily bearded stretched his listless powerful length beyond a broken
bamboo chair with his eyes fixed on the fire The woman crouched
crosslegged upon the broad earthen hearth with her eyes blinkingly
fixed on her companion They were small black round berrylike eyes
and as the firelight shone upon her smoky face with its one striped
cheek of gorgeous brilliancy it was plainly the Princess Bob and no
other

Not a word was spoken They had been sitting thus for more than an
hour and there was about their attitude a suggestion that silence was
habitual Once or twice the man rose and walked up and down the narrow
room or gazed absently from the windows of the pilothouse but never
by look or sign betrayed the slightest consciousness of his companion
At such times the Princess from her nest by the fire followed him with
eyes of canine expectancy and wistfulness But he would as inevitably
return to his contemplation of the fire and the Princess to her
blinking watchfulness of his face

They had sat there silent and undisturbed for many an evening in fair
weather and foul They had spent many a day in sunshine and storm
gathering the unclaimed spoil of sea and shore They had kept these mute
relations varied only by the incidents of the hunt or meagre household
duties for three years ever since the man wandering moodily over the
lonely sands had fallen upon the halfstarved woman lying in the little
hollow where she had crawled to die It had seemed as if they would
never be disturbed until now when the Princess started and with the
instinct of her race bent her ear to the ground

The wind had risen and was rattling the tarred canvas But in another
moment there plainly came from without the hut the sound of voices
Then followed a rap at the door then another rap and then before they
could rise to their feet the door was flung briskly open

I beg your pardon said a pleasant but somewhat decided contralto
voice but I dont think you heard me knock Ah I see you did not May
I come in

There was no reply Had the battered figurehead of the Goddess of
Liberty which lay deeply embedded in the sand on the beach suddenly
appeared at the door demanding admittance the occupants of the cabin
could not have been more speechlessly and hopelessly astonished than at
the form which stood in the open doorway

It was that of a slim shapely elegantly dressed young woman A
scarletlined silken hood was half thrown back from the shining mass of
the black hair that covered her small head from her pretty shoulders
dropped a fur cloak only restrained by a cord and tassel in her small
gloved hand Around her full throat was a double necklace of large white
beads that by some cunning feminine trick relieved with its infantile
suggestion the strong decision of her lower face

Did you say yes Ah thank you We may come in Barker Here a shadow
in a blue army overcoat followed her into the cabin touched its cap
respectfully and then stood silent and erect against the wall Dont
disturb yourself in the least I beg What a distressingly unpleasant
night Is this your usual climate

Half graciously half absently overlooking the still embarrassed silence
of the group she went on We started from the fort over three hours
agothree hours ago wasnt it Barker the erect Barker touched his
capto go to Captain Emmonss quarters on Indian IslandI think
you call it Indian Island dont you she was appealing to the
awestricken Princessand we got into the fog and lost our way that
is Barker lost his way Barker touched his cap deprecatingly and
goodness knows where we didnt wander to until we mistook your light
for the lighthouse and pulled up here No no pray keep your seat do
Really I must insist

Nothing could exceed the languid grace of the latter part of this
speechnothing except the easy unconsciousness with which she glided
by the offered chair of her stammering embarrassed host and stood
beside the open hearth

Barker will tell you she continued warming her feet by the fire
that I am Miss Portfire daughter of Major Portfire commanding the
post Ah excuse me child She had accidentally trodden upon the bare
yellow toes of the Princess Really I did not know you were there I
am very nearsighted In confirmation of her statement she put to
her eyes a dainty double eyeglass that dangled from her neck Its a
shocking thing to be nearsighted isnt it

If the shamefaced uneasy man to whom this remark was addressed could
have found words to utter the thought that even in his confusion
struggled uppermost in his mind he would looking at the bold dark
eyes that questioned him have denied the fact But he only stammered
Yes The next moment however Miss Portfire had apparently forgotten
him and was examining the Princess through her glass

And what is your name child

The Princess beatified by the eyes and eyeglass showed all her white
teeth at once and softly scratched her leg

Bob

Bob What a singular name

Miss Portfires host here hastened to explain the origin of the
Princesss title

Then YOU are Bob Eyeglass

No my name is GreyJohn Grey And he actually achieved a bow where
awkwardness was rather the air of imperfectly recalling a forgotten
habit

Greyah let me see Yes certainly You are Mr Grey the recluse
the hermit the philosopher and all that sort of thing Why certainly
Dr Jones our surgeon has told me all about you Dear me how
interesting a rencontre Lived all alone here for sevenwas it seven
yearsyes I remember now Existed quite au naturel one might say
How odd Not that I know anything about that sort of thing you know
Ive lived always among people and am really quite a stranger I assure
you But honestly MrI beg your pardonMr Grey how do you like
it

She had quietly taken his chair and thrown her cloak and hood over its
back and was now thoughtfully removing her gloves Whatever were the
argumentsand they were doubtless many and profoundwhatever the
experienceand it was doubtless hard and satisfying enoughby which
this unfortunate man had justified his life for the last seven years
somehow they suddenly became trivial and terribly ridiculous before this
simple but practical question

Well you shall tell me all about it after you have given me something
to eat We will have time enough Barker cannot find his way back
in this fog tonight Now dont put yourselves to any trouble on my
account Barker will assist

Barker came forward Glad to escape the scrutiny of his guest the
hermit gave a few rapid directions to the Princess in her native tongue
and disappeared in the shed Left a moment alone Miss Portfire took
a quick halfaudible feminine inventory of the cabin Books guns
skins ONE chair ONE bed no pictures and no lookingglass She took
a book from the swinging shelf and resumed her seat by the fire as the
Princess reentered with fresh fuel But while kneeling on the hearth
the Princess chanced to look up and met Miss Portfires dark eyes over
the edge of her book

Bob

The Princess showed her teeth

Listen Would you like to have fine clothes rings and beads like
these to have your hair nicely combed and put up so Would you

The Princess nodded violently

Would you like to live with me and have them Answer quickly Dont
look round for HIM Speak for yourself Would you Hush never mind
now

The hermit reentered and the Princess blinking retreated into the
shadow of the whaleboat shed from which she did not emerge even when
the homely repast of cold venison ship biscuit and tea was served
Miss Portfire noticed her absence You really must not let me interfere
with your usual simple ways Do you know this is exceedingly interesting
to me so pastoral and patriarchal and all that sort of thing I must
insist upon the Princess coming back really I must

But the Princess was not to be found in the shed and Miss Portfire who
the next minute seemed to have forgotten all about her took her place
in the single chair before an extemporized table Barker stood behind
her and the hermit leaned against the fireplace Miss Portfires
appetite did not come up to her protestations For the first time in
seven years it occurred to the hermit that his ordinary victual might be
improved He stammered out something to that effect

I have eaten better and worse said Miss Portfire quietly

But I thought youthat is you said

I spent a year in the hospitals when father was on the Potomac
returned Miss Portfire composedly After a pause she continued You
remember after the second Bull RunBut dear me I beg your pardon of
course you know nothing about the war and all that sort of thing and
dont care She put up her eyeglass and quietly surveyed his broad
muscular figure against the chimney Or perhaps your prejudicesBut
then as a hermit you know you have no politics of course Please dont
let me bore you

To have been strictly consistent the hermit should have exhibited no
interest in this topic Perhaps it was owing to some quality in the
narrator but he was constrained to beg her to continue in such phrases
as his unfamiliar lips could command So that little by little Miss
Portfire yielded up incident and personal observation of the contest
then raging with the same halfabstracted halfunconcerned air that
seemed habitual to her she told the stories of privation of suffering
of endurance and of sacrifice With the same assumption of timid
deference that concealed her great selfcontrol she talked of
principles and rights Apparently without enthusiasm and without effort
of which his morbid nature would have been suspicious she sang the
great American Iliad in a way that stirred the depths of her solitary
auditor to its massive foundations Then she stopped and asked quietly
Where is Bob

The hermit started He would look for her But Bob for some reason
was not forthcoming Search was made within and without the hut but in
vain For the first time that evening Miss Portfire showed some anxiety
Go she said to Barker and find her She MUST be found stay give
me your overcoat Ill go myself She threw the overcoat over her
shoulders and stepped out into the night In the thick veil of fog that
seemed suddenly to inwrap her she stood for a moment irresolute and
then walked toward the beach guided by the low wash of waters on the
sand She had not taken many steps before she stumbled over some dark
crouching object Reaching down her hand she felt the coarse wiry mane
of the Princess

Bob

There was no reply

Bob Ive been looking for you come

Go way

Nonsense Bob I want you to stay with me tonight come

Injin squaw no good for waugee woman Go way

Listen Bob You are daughter of a chief so am I Your father had many
warriors so has mine It is good that you stay with me Come

The Princess chuckled and suffered herself to be lifted up A few
moments later and they reentered the hut hand in hand

With the first red streaks of dawn the next day the erect Barker touched
his cap at the door of the hut Beside him stood the hermit also just
risen from his blanketed nest in the sand Forth from the hut fresh
as the morning air stepped Miss Portfire leading the Princess by the
hand Hand in hand also they walked to the shore and when the Princess
had been safely bestowed in the stern sheets Miss Portfire turned and
held out her own to her late host

I shall take the best of care of her of course You will come and see
her often I should ask you to come and see me but you are a hermit
you know and all that sort of thing But if its the correct anchorite
thing and can be done my father will be glad to requite you for this
nights hospitality But dont do anything on my account that interferes
with your simple habits Good by

She handed him a card which he took mechanically

Good by

The sail was hoisted and the boat shoved off As the fresh morning
breeze caught the white canvas it seemed to bow a parting salutation
There was a rosy flash of promise on the water and as the light craft
darted forward toward the ascending sun it seemed for a moment uplifted
in its glory


Miss Portfire kept her word If thoughtful care and intelligent kindness
could regenerate the Princess her future was secure And it really
seemed as if she were for the first time inclined to heed the lessons
of civilization and profit by her new condition An agreeable change was
first noticed in her appearance Her lawless hair was caught in a net
and no longer strayed over her low forehead Her unstable bust was
stayed and upheld by French corsets her plantigrade shuffle was limited
by heeled boots Her dresses were neat and clean and she wore a double
necklace of glass beads With this physical improvement there also
seemed some moral awakening She no longer stole nor lied With the
possession of personal property came a respect for that of others With
increased dependence on the word of those about her came a thoughtful
consideration of her own Intellectually she was still feeble although
she grappled sturdily with the simple lessons which Miss Portfire set
before her But her zeal and simple vanity outran her discretion and
she would often sit for hours with an open book before her which she
could not read She was a favorite with the officers at the fort from
the Major who shared his daughters prejudices and often yielded to her
powerful selfwill to the subalterns who liked her none the less that
their natural enemies the frontier volunteers had declared war
against her helpless sisterhood The only restraint put upon her was the
limitation of her liberty to the enclosure of the fort and parade and
only once did she break this parole and was stopped by the sentry as
she stepped into a boat at the landing

The recluse did not avail himself of Miss Portfires invitation But
after the departure of the Princess he spent less of his time in the
hut and was more frequently seen in the distant marshes of Eel River
and on the upland hills A feverish restlessness quite opposed to his
usual phlegm led him into singular freaks strangely inconsistent with
his usual habits and reputation The purser of the occasional steamer
which stopped at Logport with the mails reported to have been boarded
just inside the bar by a strange bearded man who asked for a newspaper
containing the last war telegrams He tore his red shirt into narrow
strips and spent two days with his needle over the pieces and the
tattered remnant of his only white garment and a few days afterward
the fishermen on the bay were surprised to see what on nearer approach
proved to be a rude imitation of the national flag floating from a spar
above the hut

One evening as the fog began to drift over the sandhills the recluse
sat alone in his hut The fire was dying unheeded on the hearth for
he had been sitting there for a long time completely absorbed in the
blurred pages of an old newspaper Presently he arose and refolding
itan operation of great care and delicacy in its tattered
conditionplaced it under the blankets of his bed He resumed his seat
by the fire but soon began drumming with his fingers on the arm of his
chair Eventually this assumed the time and accent of some air Then
he began to whistle softly and hesitatingly as if trying to recall
a forgotten tune Finally this took shape in a rude resemblance not
unlike that which his flag bore to the national standard to Yankee
Doodle Suddenly he stopped

There was an unmistakable rapping at the door The blood which had at
first rushed to his face now forsook it and settled slowly around his
heart He tried to rise but could not Then the door was flung open
and a figure with a scarletlined hood and fur mantle stood on the
threshold With a mighty effort he took one stride to the door The next
moment he saw the wide mouth and white teeth of the Princess and was
greeted by a kiss that felt like a baptism

To tear the hood and mantle from her figure in the sudden fury that
seized him and to fiercely demand the reason of this masquerade was
his only return to her greeting Why are you here did you steal these
garments he again demanded in her guttural language as he shook her
roughly by the arm The Princess hung her head Did you he screamed
as he reached wildly for his rifle

I did

His hold relaxed and he staggered back against the wall The Princess
began to whimper Between her sobs she was trying to explain that the
Major and his daughter were going away and that they wanted to send her
to the Reservation but he cut her short Take off those things The
Princess tremblingly obeyed He rolled them up placed them in the canoe
she had just left and then leaped into the frail craft She would have
followed but with a great oath he threw her from him and with one
stroke of his paddle swept out into the fog and was gone

Jessamy said the Major a few days after as he sat at dinner with
his daughter I think I can tell you something to match the mysterious
disappearance and return of your wardrobe Your crazy friend the
recluse has enlisted this morning in the Fourth Artillery Hes a
splendidlooking animal and theres the right stuff for a soldier in
him if Im not mistaken Hes in earnest too for he enlists in the
regiment ordered back to Washington Bless me child another goblet
broken youll ruin the mess in glassware at this rate

Have you heard anything more of the Princess papa

Nothing but perhaps its as well that she has gone These cursed
settlers are at their old complaints again about what they call Indian
depredations and I have just received orders from headquarters to
keep the settlement clear of all vagabond aborigines I am afraid
my dear that a strict construction of the term would include your
protegee

The time for the departure of the Fourth Artillery had come The night
before was thick and foggy At one oclock a shot on the ramparts
called out the guard and roused the sleeping garrison The new sentry
Private Grey had challenged a dusky figure creeping on the glacis and
receiving no answer had fired The guard sent out presently returned
bearing a lifeless figure in their arms The new sentrys zeal joined
with an exfrontiersmans aim was fatal

They laid the helpless ragged form before the guardhouse door and
then saw for the first time that it was the Princess Presently she
opened her eyes They fell upon the agonized face of her innocent
slayer but haply without intelligence or reproach

Georgy she whispered

Bob

Alls same now Me get plenty well soon Me make no more fuss Me go to
Reservation

Then she stopped a tremor ran through her limbs and she lay still She
had gone to the Reservation Not that devised by the wisdom of man but
that one set apart from the foundation of the world for the wisest as
well as the meanest of His creatures




THE ILIAD OF SANDY BAR


Before nine oclock it was pretty well known all along the river that
the two partners of the Amity Claim had quarrelled and separated at
daybreak At that time the attention of their nearest neighbor had
been attracted by the sounds of altercations and two consecutive
pistolshots Running out he had seen dimly in the gray mist that
rose from the river the tall form of Scott one of the partners
descending the hill toward the canyon a moment later York the
other partner had appeared from the cabin and walked in an opposite
direction toward the river passing within a few feet of the curious
watcher Later it was discovered that a serious Chinaman cutting
wood before the cabin had witnessed part of the quarrel But John was
stolid indifferent and reticent Me choppee wood me no fightee
was his serene response to all anxious queries But what did they SAY
John John did not sabe Colonel Starbottle deftly ran over the various
popular epithets which a generous public sentiment might accept as
reasonable provocation for an assault But John did not recognize them
And this yers the cattle said the Colonel with some severity that
some thinks oughter be allowed to testify agin a White Man Gityou
heathen

Still the quarrel remained inexplicable That two men whose amiability
and grave tact had earned for them the title of The Peacemakers in
a community not greatly given to the passive virtuesthat these men
singularly devoted to each other should suddenly and violently
quarrel might well excite the curiosity of the camp A few of the more
inquisitive visited the late scene of conflict now deserted by its
former occupants There was no trace of disorder or confusion in the
neat cabin The rude table was arranged as if for breakfast the pan of
yellow biscuit still sat upon that hearth whose dead embers might have
typified the evil passions that had raged there but an hour before But
Colonel Starbottles eyealbeit somewhat bloodshot and rheumywas more
intent on practical details On examination a bullethole was found in
the doorpost and another nearly opposite in the casing of the window
The Colonel called attention to the fact that the one agreed with the
bore of Scotts revolver and the other with that of Yorks derringer
They must hev stood about yer said the Colonel taking position not
morn three feet apart andmissed There was a fine touch of pathos
in the falling inflection of the Colonels voice which was not without
effect A delicate perception of wasted opportunity thrilled his
auditors

But the Bar was destined to experience a greater disappointment The two
antagonists had not met since the quarrel and it was vaguely rumored
that on the occasion of a second meeting each had determined to kill
the other on sight There was consequently some excitementand
it is to be feared no little gratificationwhen at ten oclock York
stepped from the Magnolia Saloon into the one long straggling street of
the camp at the same moment that Scott left the blacksmiths shop at
the forks of the road It was evident at a glance that a meeting could
only be avoided by the actual retreat of one or the other

In an instant the doors and windows of the adjacent saloons were filled
with faces Heads unaccountably appeared above the riverbanks and from
behind bowlders An empty wagon at the crossroad was suddenly crowded
with people who seemed to have sprung from the earth There was much
running and confusion on the hillside On the mountainroad Mr Jack
Hamlin had reined up his horse and was standing upright on the seat of
his buggy And the two objects of this absorbing attention approached
each other

Yorks got the sun Scottll line him on that tree Hes waitin
to draw his fire came from the cart and then it was silent But
above this human breathlessness the river rushed and sang and the
wind rustled the treetops with an indifference that seemed obtrusive
Colonel Starbottle felt it and in a moment of sublime preoccupation
without looking around waved his cane behind him warningly to all
nature and said Shu

The men were now within a few feet of each other A hen ran across the
road before one of them A feathery seedvessel wafted from a wayside
tree fell at the feet of the other And unheeding this irony of
nature the two opponents came nearer erect and rigid looked in each
others eyes andpassed

Colonel Starbottle had to be lifted from the cart This yer camp is
played out he said gloomily as he affected to be supported into
the Magnolia With what further expression he might have indicated his
feelings it was impossible to say for at that moment Scott joined the
group Did you speak to me he asked of the Colonel dropping his
hand as if with accidental familiarity on that gentlemans shoulder
The Colonel recognizing some occult quality in the touch and some
unknown quantity in the glance of his questioner contented himself by
replying No sir with dignity A few rods away Yorks conduct
was as characteristic and peculiar You had a mighty fine chance why
didnt you plump him said Jack Hamlin as York drew near the buggy
Because I hate him was the reply heard only by Jack Contrary
to popular belief this reply was not hissed between the lips of the
speaker but was said in an ordinary tone But Jack Hamlin who was an
observer of mankind noticed that the speakers hands were cold and
his lips dry as he helped him into the buggy and accepted the seeming
paradox with a smile


When Sandy Bar became convinced that the quarrel between York and Scott
could not be settled after the usual local methods it gave no further
concern thereto But presently it was rumored that the Amity Claim was
in litigation and that its possession would be expensively disputed by
each of the partners As it was well known that the claim in question
was worked out and worthless and that the partners whom it had
already enriched had talked of abandoning it but a day or two before
the quarrel this proceeding could only be accounted for as gratuitous
spite Later two San Francisco lawyers made their appearance in this
guileless Arcadia and were eventually taken into the saloons andwhat
was pretty much the same thingthe confidences of the inhabitants The
results of this unhallowed intimacy were many subpoenas and indeed
when the Amity Claim came to trial all of Sandy Bar that was not in
compulsory attendance at the county seat came there from curiosity The
gulches and ditches for miles around were deserted I do not propose to
describe that already famous trial Enough that in the language of the
plaintiffs counsel it was one of no ordinary significance involving
the inherent rights of that untiring industry which had developed the
Pactolian resources of this golden land and in the homelier phrase
of Colonel Starbottle A fuss that gentlemen might hev settled in ten
minutes over a social glass ef they meant business or in ten seconds
with a revolver ef they meant fun Scott got a verdict from which
York instantly appealed It was said that he had sworn to spend his last
dollar in the struggle

In this way Sandy Bar began to accept the enmity of the former partners
as a lifelong feud and the fact that they had ever been friends was
forgotten The few who expected to learn from the trial the origin of
the quarrel were disappointed Among the various conjectures that
which ascribed some occult feminine influence as the cause was naturally
popular in a camp given to dubious compliment of the sex My word
for it gentlemen said Colonel Starbottle who had been known in
Sacramento as a Gentleman of the Old School theres some lovely
creature at the bottom of this The gallant Colonel then proceeded to
illustrate his theory by divers sprightly stories such as Gentlemen of
the Old School are in the habit of repeating but which from deference
to the prejudices of gentlemen of a more recent school I refrain from
transcribing here But it would appear that even the Colonels theory
was fallacious The only woman who personally might have exercised
any influence over the partners was the pretty daughter of old man
Folinsbee of Poverty Flat at whose hospitable housewhich exhibited
some comforts and refinements rare in that crude civilizationboth York
and Scott were frequent visitors Yet into this charming retreat York
strode one evening a month after the quarrel and beholding Scott
sitting there turned to the fair hostess with the abrupt query Do you
love this man The young woman thus addressed returned that answerat
once spirited and evasivewhich would occur to most of my fair readers
in such an exigency Without another word York left the house Miss
Jo heaved the least possible sigh as the door closed on Yorks curls
and square shoulders and then like a good girl turned to her insulted
guest But would you believe it dear she afterward related to an
intimate friend the other creature after glowering at me for a
moment got upon its hind legs took its hat and left too and thats
the last Ive seen of either

The same hard disregard of all other interests or feelings in the
gratification of their blind rancor characterized all their actions
When York purchased the land below Scotts new claim and obliged the
latter at a great expense to make a long detour to carry a tailrace
around it Scott retaliated by building a dam that overflowed Yorks
claim on the river It was Scott who in conjunction with Colonel
Starbottle first organized that active opposition to the Chinamen
which resulted in the driving off of Yorks Mongolian laborers it was
York who built the wagonroad and established the express which rendered
Scotts mules and packtrains obsolete it was Scott who called into
life the Vigilance Committee which expatriated Yorks friend
Jack Hamlin it was York who created the Sandy Bar Herald which
characterized the act as a lawless outrage and Scott as a Border
Ruffian it was Scott at the head of twenty masked men who one
moonlight night threw the offending forms into the yellow river and
scattered the types in the dusty road These proceedings were received
in the distant and more civilized outlying towns as vague indications
of progress and vitality I have before me a copy of the Poverty Flat
Pioneer for the week ending August 12 1856 in which the editor
under the head of County Improvements says The new Presbyterian
Church on C Street at Sandy Bar is completed It stands upon the lot
formerly occupied by the Magnolia Saloon which was so mysteriously
burnt last month The temple which now rises like a Phoenix from the
ashes of the Magnolia is virtually the free gift of H J York Esq
of Sandy Bar who purchased the lot and donated the lumber Other
buildings are going up in the vicinity but the most noticeable is the
Sunny South Saloon erected by Captain Mat Scott nearly opposite the
church Captain Scott has spared no expense in the furnishing of this
saloon which promises to be one of the most agreeable places of
resort in old Tuolumne He has recently imported two new firstclass
billiardtables with cork cushions Our old friend Mountain
Jimmy will dispense liquors at the bar We refer our readers to the
advertisement in another column Visitors to Sandy Bar cannot do better
than give Jimmy a call Among the local items occurred the following
H J York Esq of Sandy Bar has offered a reward of 100 for
the detection of the parties who hauled away the steps of the new
Presbyterian Church C Street Sandy Bar during divine service on
Sabbath evening last Captain Scott adds another hundred for the capture
of the miscreants who broke the magnificent plateglass windows of the
new saloon on the following evening There is some talk of reorganizing
the old Vigilance Committee at Sandy Bar

When for many months of cloudless weather the hard unwinking sun of
Sandy Bar had regularly gone down on the unpacified wrath of these
men there was some talk of mediation In particular the pastor of the
church to which I have just referreda sincere fearless but perhaps
not fully enlightened manseized gladly upon the occasion of Yorks
liberality to attempt to reunite the former partners He preached an
earnest sermon on the abstract sinfulness of discord and rancor But
the excellent sermons of the Rev Mr Daws were directed to an ideal
congregation that did not exist at Sandy Bara congregation of beings
of unmixed vices and virtues of single impulses and perfectly logical
motives of preternatural simplicity of childlike faith and grownup
responsibilities As unfortunately the people who actually attended
Mr Dawss church were mainly very human somewhat artful more
selfexcusing than selfaccusing rather goodnatured and decidedly
weak they quietly shed that portion of the sermon which referred to
themselves and accepting York and Scottwho were both in defiant
attendanceas curious examples of those ideal beings above referred
to felt a certain satisfactionwhich I fear was not altogether
Christianlikein their rakingdown If Mr Daws expected York and
Scott to shake hands after the sermon he was disappointed But he did
not relax his purpose With that quiet fearlessness and determination
which had won for him the respect of men who were too apt to regard
piety as synonymous with effeminacy he attacked Scott in his own house
What he said has not been recorded but it is to be feared that it was
part of his sermon When he had concluded Scott looked at him not
unkindly over the glasses of his bar and said less irreverently than
the words might convey Young man I rather like your style but when
you know York and me as well as you do God Almighty itll be time to
talk

And so the feud progressed and so as in more illustrious examples the
private and personal enmity of two representative men led gradually to
the evolution of some crude halfexpressed principle or belief It was
not long before it was made evident that those beliefs were identical
with certain broad principles laid down by the founders of the American
Constitution as expounded by the statesmanlike A or were the fatal
quicksands on which the ship of state might be wrecked warningly
pointed out by the eloquent B The practical result of all which was the
nomination of York and Scott to represent the opposite factions of Sandy
Bar in legislative councils

For some weeks past the voters of Sandy Bar and the adjacent camps had
been called upon in large type to RALLY In vain the great pines
at the crossroadswhose trunks were compelled to bear this and other
legendsmoaned and protested from their windy watchtowers But one
day with fife and drum and flaming transparency a procession filed
into the triangular grove at the head of the gulch The meeting
was called to order by Colonel Starbottle who having once enjoyed
legislative functions and being vaguely known as a warhorse was
considered to be a valuable partisan of York He concluded an appeal for
his friend with an enunciation of principles interspersed with one or
two anecdotes so gratuitously coarse that the very pines might have been
moved to pelt him with their castoff cones as he stood there But he
created a laugh on which his candidate rode into popular notice and
when York rose to speak he was greeted with cheers But to the general
astonishment the new speaker at once launched into bitter denunciation
of his rival He not only dwelt upon Scotts deeds and example as known
to Sandy Bar but spoke of facts connected with his previous career
hitherto unknown to his auditors To great precision of epithet and
directness of statement the speaker added the fascination of revelation
and exposure The crowd cheered yelled and were delighted but when
this astounding philippic was concluded there was a unanimous call
for Scott Colonel Starbottle would have resisted this manifest
impropriety but in vain Partly from a crude sense of justice partly
from a meaner craving for excitement the assemblage was inflexible and
Scott was dragged pushed and pulled upon the platform

As his frowsy head and unkempt beard appeared above the railing it was
evident that he was drunk But it was also evident before he opened his
lips that the orator of Sandy Barthe one man who could touch their
vagabond sympathies perhaps because he was not above appealing to
themstood before them A consciousness of this power lent a certain
dignity to his figure and I am not sure but that his very physical
condition impressed them as a kind of regal unbending and large
condescension Howbeit when this unexpected Hector arose from the
ditch Yorks myrmidons trembled

Theres naught gentlemen said Scott leaning forward on the
railingtheres naught as that man hez said as isnt true I was run
outer Cairo I did belong to the Regulators I did desert from the army
I did leave a wife in Kansas But thars one thing he didnt charge me
with and maybe hes forgotten For three years gentlemen I was
that mans pardner Whether he intended to say more I cannot tell
a burst of applause artistically rounded and enforced the climax and
virtually elected the speaker That fall he went to Sacramento York
went abroad and for the first time in many years distance and a new
atmosphere isolated the old antagonists


With little of change in the green wood gray rock and yellow river
but with much shifting of human landmarks and new faces in its
habitations three years passed over Sandy Bar The two men once so
identified with its character seemed to have been quite forgotten
You will never return to Sandy Bar said Miss Folinsbee the Lily of
Poverty Flat on meeting York in Paris for Sandy Bar is no more
They call it Riverside now and the new town is built higher up on the
riverbank By the by Jo says that Scott has won his suit about the
Amity Claim and that he lives in the old cabin and is drunk half his
time O I beg your pardon added the lively lady as a flush crossed
Yorks sallow cheek but bless me I really thought that old grudge
was made up Im sure it ought to be

It was three months after this conversation and a pleasant summer
evening that the Poverty Flat coach drew up before the veranda of the
Union Hotel at Sandy Bar Among its passengers was one apparently a
stranger in the local distinction of wellfitting clothes and closely
shaven face who demanded a private room and retired early to rest But
before sunrise next morning he arose and drawing some clothes from his
carpetbag proceeded to array himself in a pair of white duck trousers
a white duck overshirt and straw hat When his toilet was completed he
tied a red bandanna handkerchief in a loop and threw it loosely over his
shoulders The transformation was complete As he crept softly down the
stairs and stepped into the road no one would have detected in him the
elegant stranger of the previous night and but few have recognized the
face and figure of Henry York of Sandy Bar

In the uncertain light of that early hour and in the change that had
come over the settlement he had to pause for a moment to recall where
he stood The Sandy Bar of his recollection lay below him nearer the
river the buildings around him were of later date and newer fashion
As he strode toward the river he noticed here a schoolhouse and there a
church A little farther on The Sunny South came in view transformed
into a restaurant its gilding faded and its paint rubbed off He now
knew where he was and running briskly down a declivity crossed a
ditch and stood upon the lower boundary of the Amity Claim

The gray mist was rising slowly from the river clinging to the
treetops and drifting up the mountainside until it was caught among
those rocky altars and held a sacrifice to the ascending sun At his
feet the earth cruelly gashed and scarred by his forgotten engines
had since the old days put on a show of greenness here and there and
now smiled forgivingly up at him as if things were not so bad after
all A few birds were bathing in the ditch with a pleasant suggestion of
its being a new and special provision of nature and a hare ran into an
inverted sluicebox as he approached as if it were put there for that
purpose

He had not yet dared to look in a certain direction But the sun was now
high enough to paint the little eminence on which the cabin stood In
spite of his selfcontrol his heart beat faster as he raised his eyes
toward it Its window and door were closed no smoke came from its adobe
chimney but it was else unchanged When within a few yards of it he
picked up a broken shovel and shouldering it with a smile strode
toward the door and knocked There was no sound from within The smile
died upon his lips as he nervously pushed the door open

A figure started up angrily and came toward hima figure whose
bloodshot eyes suddenly fixed into a vacant stare whose arms were
at first outstretched and then thrown up in warning gesticulationa
figure that suddenly gasped choked and then fell forward in a fit

But before he touched the ground York had him out into the open air and
sunshine In the struggle both fell and rolled over on the ground But
the next moment York was sitting up holding the convulsed frame of his
former partner on his knee and wiping the foam from his inarticulate
lips Gradually the tremor became less frequent and then ceased and
the strong man lay unconscious in his arms

For some moments York held him quietly thus looking in his face Afar
the stroke of a woodmans axea mere phantom of soundwas all
that broke the stillness High up the mountain a wheeling hawk hung
breathlessly above them And then came voices and two men joined them

A fight No a fit and would they help him bring the sick man to the
hotel

And there for a week the stricken partner lay unconscious of aught
but the visions wrought by disease and fear On the eighth day at
sunrise he rallied and opening his eyes looked upon York and
pressed his hand then he spoke

And its you I thought it was only whiskey

York replied by taking both of his hands boyishly working them backward
and forward as his elbow rested on the bed with a pleasant smile

And youve been abroad How did you like Paris

So so How did YOU like Sacramento

Bully

And that was all they could think to say Presently Scott opened his
eyes again

Im mighty weak

Youll get better soon

Not much

A long silence followed in which they could hear the sounds of
woodchopping and that Sandy Bar was already astir for the coming
day Then Scott slowly and with difficulty turned his face to York and
said

I might hev killed you once

I wish you had

They pressed each others hands again but Scotts grasp was evidently
failing He seemed to summon his energies for a special effort

Old man

Old chap

Closer

York bent his head toward the slowly fading face

Do ye mind that morning

Yes

A gleam of fun slid into the corner of Scotts blue eye as he
whispered

Old man thar WAS too much saleratus in that bread

It is said that these were his last words For when the sun which had
so often gone down upon the idle wrath of these foolish men looked
again upon them reunited it saw the hand of Scott fall cold and
irresponsive from the yearning clasp of his former partner and it knew
that the feud of Sandy Bar was at an end




MR THOMPSONS PRODIGAL


We all knew that Mr Thompson was looking for his son and a pretty bad
one at that That he was coming to California for this sole object was
no secret to his fellowpassengers and the physical peculiarities as
well as the moral weaknesses of the missing prodigal were made equally
plain to us through the frank volubility of the parent You was
speaking of a young man which was hung at Red Dog for sluicerobbing
said Mr Thompson to a steerage passenger one day be you aware of
the color of his eyes Black responded the passenger Ah said
Mr Thompson referring to some mental memoranda Charless eyes was
blue He then walked away Perhaps it was from this unsympathetic mode
of inquiry perhaps it was from that Western predilection to take a
humorous view of any principle or sentiment persistently brought before
them that Mr Thompsons quest was the subject of some satire among the
passengers A gratuitous advertisement of the missing Charles addressed
to Jailers and Guardians circulated privately among them everybody
remembered to have met Charles under distressing circumstances Yet
it is but due to my countrymen to state that when it was known that
Thompson had embarked some wealth in this visionary project but little
of this satire found its way to his ears and nothing was uttered in
his hearing that might bring a pang to a fathers heart or imperil
a possible pecuniary advantage of the satirist Indeed Mr Bracy
Tibbetss jocular proposition to form a jointstock company to
prospect for the missing youth received at one time quite serious
entertainment

Perhaps to superficial criticism Mr Thompsons nature was not
picturesque nor lovable His history as imparted at dinner one day by
himself was practical even in its singularity After a hard and wilful
youth and maturityin which he had buried a brokenspirited wife and
driven his son to seahe suddenly experienced religion I got it in
New Orleans in 59 said Mr Thompson with the general suggestion
of referring to an epidemic Enter ye the narrer gate Parse me the
beans Perhaps this practical quality upheld him in his apparently
hopeless search He had no clew to the whereabouts of his runaway son
indeed scarcely a proof of his present existence From his indifferent
recollection of the boy of twelve he now expected to identify the man
of twentyfive

It would seem that he was successful How he succeeded was one of the
few things he did not tell There are I believe two versions of the
story One that Mr Thompson visiting a hospital discovered his son
by reason of a peculiar hymn chanted by the sufferer in a delirious
dream of his boyhood This version giving as it did wide range to the
finer feelings of the heart was quite popular and as told by the Rev
Mr Gushington on his return from his California tour never failed to
satisfy an audience The other was less simple and as I shall adopt it
here deserves more elaboration

It was after Mr Thompson had given up searching for his son among the
living and had taken to the examination of cemeteries and a careful
inspection of the cold hic jacets of the dead At this time he was a
frequent visitor of Lone Mountaina dreary hilltop bleak enough in
its original isolation and bleaker for the whitefaced marbles by which
San Francisco anchored her departed citizens and kept them down in
a shifting sand that refused to cover them and against a fierce and
persistent wind that strove to blow them utterly away Against this wind
the old man opposed a will quite as persistenta grizzled hard face
and a tall crapebound hat drawn tightly over his eyesand so spent
days in reading the mortuary inscriptions audibly to himself The
frequency of Scriptural quotation pleased him and he was fond of
corroborating them by a pocket Bible Thats from Psalms he said
one day to an adjacent gravedigger The man made no reply Not at all
rebuffed Mr Thompson at once slid down into the open grave with a
more practical inquiry Did you ever in your profession come across
Charles Thompson Thompson be dd said the gravedigger
with great directness Which if he hadnt religion I think he is
responded the old man as he clambered out of the grave

It was perhaps on this occasion that Mr Thompson stayed later than
usual As he turned his face toward the city lights were beginning
to twinkle ahead and a fierce wind made visible by fog drove him
forward or lying in wait charged him angrily from the corners of
deserted suburban streets It was on one of these corners that something
else quite as indistinct and malevolent leaped upon him with an oath
a presented pistol and a demand for money But it was met by a will of
iron and a grip of steel The assailant and assailed rolled together on
the ground But the next moment the old man was erect one hand grasping
the captured pistol the other clutching at arms length the throat of a
figure surly youthful and savage

Young man said Mr Thompson setting his thin lips together what
might be your name

Thompson

The old mans hand slid from the throat to the arm of his prisoner
without relaxing its firmness

Charles Thompson come with me he said presently and marched his
captive to the hotel What took place there has not transpired but it
was known the next morning that Mr Thompson had found his son


It is proper to add to the above improbable story that there was
nothing in the young mans appearance or manners to justify it Grave
reticent and handsome devoted to his newly found parent he assumed
the emoluments and responsibilities of his new condition with a certain
serious ease that more nearly approached that which San Francisco
society lacked andrejected Some chose to despise this quality as a
tendency to psalmsinging others saw in it the inherited qualities
of the parent and were ready to prophesy for the son the same hard
old age But all agreed that it was not inconsistent with the habits of
moneygetting for which father and son were respected

And yet the old man did not seem to be happy Perhaps it was that
the consummation of his wishes left him without a practical mission
perhapsand it is the more probablehe had little love for the son he
had regained The obedience he exacted was freely given the reform he
had set his heart upon was complete and yet somehow it did not
seem to please him In reclaiming his son he had fulfilled all the
requirements that his religious duty required of him and yet the act
seemed to lack sanctification In this perplexity he read again the
parable of the Prodigal Sonwhich he had long ago adopted for
his guidanceand found that he had omitted the final feast
of reconciliation This seemed to offer the proper quality of
ceremoniousness in the sacrament between himself and his son and so a
year after the appearance of Charles he set about giving him a party
Invite everybody Charles he said dryly everybody who knows that
I brought you out of the winehusks of iniquity and the company of
harlots and bid them eat drink and be merry

Perhaps the old man had another reason not yet clearly analyzed The
fine house he had built on the sandhills sometimes seemed lonely and
bare He often found himself trying to reconstruct from the grave
features of Charles the little boy whom he but dimly remembered in the
past and of whom lately he had been thinking a great deal He believed
this to be a sign of impending old age and childishness but coming one
day in his formal drawingroom upon a child of one of the servants
who had strayed therein he would have taken him in his arms but the
child fled from before his grizzled face So that it seemed eminently
proper to invite a number of people to his house and from the array
of San Francisco maidenhood to select a daughterinlaw And then there
would be a childa boy whom he could rare up from the beginning
andloveas he did not love Charles

We were all at the party The Smiths Joneses Browns and Robinsons
also came in that fine flow of animal spirits unchecked by any respect
for the entertainer which most of us are apt to find so fascinating
The proceedings would have been somewhat riotous but for the social
position of the actors In fact Mr Bracy Tibbets having naturally a
fine appreciation of a humorous situation but further impelled by the
bright eyes of the Jones girls conducted himself so remarkably as to
attract the serious regard of Mr Charles Thompson who approached him
saying quietly You look ill Mr Tibbets let me conduct you to your
carriage Resist you hound and Ill throw you through that window
This way please the room is close and distressing It is hardly
necessary to say that but a part of this speech was audible to the
company and that the rest was not divulged by Mr Tibbets who
afterward regretted the sudden illness which kept him from witnessing a
certain amusing incident which the fastest Miss Jones characterized as
the richest part of the blowout and which I hasten to record

It was at supper It was evident that Mr Thompson had overlooked
much lawlessness in the conduct of the younger people in his abstract
contemplation of some impending event When the cloth was removed he
rose to his feet and grimly tapped upon the table A titter that broke
out among the Jones girls became epidemic on one side of the board
Charles Thompson from the foot of the table looked up in tender
perplexity Hes going to sing a Doxology Hes going to pray
Silence for a speech ran round the room

Its one year today Christian brothers and sisters said Mr
Thompson with grim deliberationone year today since my son
came home from eating of winehusks and spending of his substance on
harlots The tittering suddenly ceased Look at him now Charles
Thompson stand up Charles Thompson stood up One year ago
todayand look at him now

He was certainly a handsome prodigal standing there in his cheerful
eveningdressa repentant prodigal with sad obedient eyes turned
upon the harsh and unsympathetic glance of his father The youngest
Miss Smith from the pure depths of her foolish little heart moved
unconsciously toward him

Its fifteen years ago since he left my house said Mr Thompson
a rovier and a prodigal I was myself a man of sin O Christian
friendsa man of wrath and bitterness Amen from the eldest Miss
Smithbut praise be God Ive fled the wrath to come Its five
years ago since I got the peace that passeth understanding Have you got
it friends A general subchorus of No no from the girls
and Pass the word for it from Midshipman Coxe of the U S sloop
Wethersfield Knock and it shall be opened to you

And when I found the error of my ways and the preciousness of grace
continued Mr Thompson I came to give it to my son By sea and land I
sought him far and fainted not I did not wait for him to come to me
which the same I might have done and justified myself by the Book of
books but I sought him out among his husks and the rest of the
sentence was lost in the rustling withdrawal of the ladies Works
Christian friends is my motto By their works shall ye know them and
there is mine

The particular and accepted work to which Mr Thompson was alluding had
turned quite pale and was looking fixedly toward an open door leading
to the veranda lately filled by gaping servants and now the scene of
some vague tumult As the noise continued a man shabbily dressed and
evidently in liquor broke through the opposing guardians and staggered
into the room The transition from the fog and darkness without to the
glare and heat within evidently dazzled and stupefied him He removed
his battered hat and passed it once or twice before his eyes as he
steadied himself but unsuccessfully by the back of a chair Suddenly
his wandering glance fell upon the pale face of Charles Thompson and
with a gleam of childlike recognition and a weak falsetto laugh he
darted forward caught at the table upset the glasses and literally
fell upon the prodigals breast

Shaly yo dd ol scounrel hoo rar ye

Hushsit downhush said Charles Thompson hurriedly endeavoring to
extricate himself from the embrace of his unexpected guest

Look at m continued the stranger unheeding the admonition but
suddenly holding the unfortunate Charles at arms length in loving and
undisguised admiration of his festive appearance Look at m Aint he
nasty Shals Im prow of yer

Leave the house said Mr Thompson rising with a dangerous look in
his cold gray eye Charles how dare you

Simmer down ole man Shals whos th ol bloat Eh

Hush man here take this With nervous hands Charles Thompson
filled a glass with liquor Drink it and gountil tomorrowany time
butleave usgo now But even then ere the miserable wretch could
drink the old man pale with passion was upon him Half carrying him
in his powerful arms half dragging him through the circling crowd of
frightened guests he had reached the door swung open by the waiting
servants when Charles Thompson started from a seeming stupor crying

Stop

The old man stopped Through the open door the fog and wind drove
chilly What does this mean he asked turning a baleful face on
Charles

Nothingbut stopfor Gods sake Wait till tomorrow but not
tonight Do notI implore youdo this thing

There was something in the tone of the young mans voice something
perhaps in the contact of the struggling wretch he held in his powerful
arms but a dim indefinite fear took possession of the old mans heart
Who he whispered hoarsely is this man

Charles did not answer

Stand back there all of you thundered Mr Thompson to the crowding
guests around him Charlescome here I command youIIIbeg
youtell me WHO is this man

Only two persons heard the answer that came faintly from the lips of
Charles Thompson

YOUR SON


When day broke over the bleak sandhills the guests had departed from
Mr Thompsons banquethalls The lights still burned dimly and coldly
in the deserted roomsdeserted by all but three figures that huddled
together in the chill drawingroom as if for warmth One lay in drunken
slumber on a couch at his feet sat he who had been known as Charles
Thompson and beside them haggard and shrunken to half his size bowed
the figure of Mr Thompson his gray eye fixed his elbows upon his
knees and his hands clasped over his ears as if to shut out the sad
entreating voice that seemed to fill the room

God knows I did not set about to wilfully deceive The name I gave that
night was the first that came into my thoughtthe name of one whom
I thought deadthe dissolute companion of my shame And when you
questioned further I used the knowledge that I gained from him to touch
your heart to set me free only I swear for that But when you told
me who you were and I first saw the opening of another life before
methenthenO sir if I was hungry homeless and reckless when
I would have robbed you of your gold I was heartsick helpless and
desperate when I would have robbed you of your love

The old man stirred not From his luxurious couch the newly found
prodigal snored peacefully

I had no father I could claim I never knew a home but this I was
tempted I have been happyvery happy

He rose and stood before the old man Do not fear that I shall come
between your son and his inheritance Today I leave this place never
to return The world is large sir and thanks to your kindness I now
see the way by which an honest livelihood is gained Good by You will
not take my hand Well well Good by

He turned to go But when he had reached the door he suddenly came back
and raising with both hands the grizzled head he kissed it once and
twice

Charles

There was no reply

Charles

The old man rose with a frightened air and tottered feebly to the door
It was open There came to him the awakened tumult of a great city in
which the prodigals footsteps were lost forever




THE ROMANCE OF MADRONO HOLLOW


The latch on the garden gate of the Folinsbee Ranch clicked twice
The gate itself was so much in shadow that lovely night that old man
Folinsbee sitting on his porch could distinguish nothing but a tall
white hat and beside it a few fluttering ribbons under the pines that
marked the entrance Whether because of this fact or that he considered
a sufficient time had elapsed since the clicking of the latch for more
positive disclosure I do not know but after a few moments hesitation
he quietly laid aside his pipe and walked slowly down the winding path
toward the gate At the Ceanothus hedge he stopped and listened

There was not much to hear The hat was saying to the ribbons that it
was a fine night and remarking generally upon the clear outline of the
Sierras against the blueblack sky The ribbons it so appeared had
admired this all the way home and asked the hat if it had ever seen
anything half so lovely as the moonlight on the summit The hat never
had it recalled some lovely nights in the South in Alabama in the
South in Ahlabahm was the way the old man heard it but then there
were other things that made this night seem so pleasant The ribbons
could not possibly conceive what the hat could be thinking about At
this point there was a pause of which Mr Folinsbee availed himself to
walk very grimly and craunchingly down the gravelwalk toward the
gate Then the hat was lifted and disappeared in the shadow and Mr
Folinsbee confronted only the halffoolish halfmischievous but wholly
pretty face of his daughter

It was afterward known to Madrono Hollow that sharp words passed between
Miss Jo and the old man and that the latter coupled the names of one
Culpepper Starbottle and his uncle Colonel Starbottle with certain
uncomplimentary epithets and that Miss Jo retaliated sharply Her
fathers blood before her fathers face boiled up and proved her truly
of his race quoted the blacksmith who leaned toward the noble verse
of Byron She saw the old mans bluff and raised him was the directer
comment of the collegebred Masters

Meanwhile the subject of these animadversions proceeded slowly along
the road to a point where the Folinsbee mansion came in viewa long
narrow white building unpretentious yet superior to its neighbors
and bearing some evidences of taste and refinement in the vines that
clambered over its porch in its French windows and the white muslin
curtains that kept out the fierce California sun by day and were now
touched with silver in the gracious moonlight Culpepper leaned against
the low fence and gazed long and earnestly at the building Then the
moonlight vanished ghostlike from one of the windows a material glow
took its place and a girlish figure holding a candle drew the white
curtains together To Culpepper it was a vestal virgin standing before
a hallowed shrine to the prosaic observer I fear it was only a
fairhaired young woman whose wicked black eyes still shone with
unfilial warmth Howbeit when the figure had disappeared he stepped
out briskly into the moonlight of the highroad Here he took off his
distinguishing hat to wipe his forehead and the moon shone full upon
his face

It was not an unprepossessing one albeit a trifle too thin and lank and
bilious to be altogether pleasant The cheekbones were prominent
and the black eyes sunken in their orbits Straight black hair fell
slantwise off a high but narrow forehead and swept part of a hollow
cheek A long black mustache followed the perpendicular curves of his
mouth It was on the whole a serious even Quixotic face but at
times it was relieved by a rare smile of such tender and even pathetic
sweetness that Miss Jo is reported to have said that if it would only
last through the ceremony she would have married its possessor on the
spot I once told him so added that shameless young woman but the
man instantly fell into a settled melancholy and hasnt smiled since

A halfmile below the Folinsbee Ranch the white road dipped and was
crossed by a trail that ran through Madrono hollow Perhaps because it
was a near cutoff to the settlement perhaps from some less practical
reason Culpepper took this trail and in a few moments stood among the
rarely beautiful trees that gave their name to the valley Even in that
uncertain light the weird beauty of these harlequin masqueraders was
apparent their red trunksa blush in the moonlight a deep bloodstain
in the shadowstood out against the silvery green foliage It was as
if Nature in some gracious moment had here caught and crystallized the
gypsy memories of the transplanted Spaniard to cheer him in his lonely
exile

As Culpepper entered the grove he heard loud voices As he turned toward
a clump of trees a figure so bizarre and characteristic that it might
have been a resident Daphnea figure overdressed in crimson silk
and lace with bare brown arms and shoulders and a wreath of
honeysucklestepped out of the shadow It was followed by a man
Culpepper started To come to the point briefly he recognized in the
man the features of his respected uncle Colonel Starbottle in the
female a lady who may be briefly described as one possessing absolutely
no claim to an introduction to the polite reader To hurry over equally
unpleasant details both were evidently under the influence of liquor

From the excited conversation that ensued Culpepper gathered that
some insult had been put upon the lady at a public ball which she had
attended that evening that the Colonel her escort had failed to
resent it with the sanguinary completeness that she desired I regret
that even in a liberal age I may not record the exact and even
picturesque language in which this was conveyed to her hearers Enough
that at the close of a fiery peroration with feminine inconsistency
she flew at the gallant Colonel and would have visited her delayed
vengeance upon his luckless head but for the prompt interference of
Culpepper Thwarted in this she threw herself upon the ground and then
into unpicturesque hysterics There was a fine moral lesson not only in
this grotesque performance of a sex which cannot afford to be grotesque
but in the ludicrous concern with which it inspired the two men
Culpepper to whom woman was more or less angelic was pained and
sympathetic the Colonel to whom she was more or less improper was
exceedingly terrified and embarrassed Howbeit the storm was soon over
and after Mistress Dolores had returned a little dagger to its sheath
her garter she quietly took herself out of Madrono Hollow and
happily out of these pages forever The two men left to themselves
conversed in low tones Dawn stole upon them before they separated
the Colonel quite sobered and in full possession of his usual jaunty
selfassertion Culpepper with a baleful glow in his hollow cheek and
in his dark eyes a rising fire


The next morning the general ear of Madrono Hollow was filled with
rumors of the Colonels mishap It was asserted that he had been invited
to withdraw his female companion from the floor of the Assembly Ball
at the Independence Hotel and that failing to do this both were
expelled It is to be regretted that in 1854 public opinion was divided
in regard to the propriety of this step and that there was some
discussion as to the comparative virtue of the ladies who were not
expelled but it was generally conceded that the real casus belli was
political Is this a dashed Puritan meeting had asked the
Colonel savagely Its no Pike County shindig had responded the
floormanager cheerfully Youre a Yank had screamed the Colonel
profanely qualifying the noun Get you border ruffian was the reply
Such at least was the substance of the reports As at that sincere
epoch expressions like the above were usually followed by prompt
action a fracas was confidently looked for

Nothing however occurred Colonel Starbottle made his appearance next
day upon the streets with somewhat of his usual pomposity a little
restrained by the presence of his nephew who accompanied him and who
as a universal favorite also exercised some restraint upon the curious
and impertinent But Culpeppers face wore a look of anxiety quite at
variance with his usual grave repose The Don dont seem to take
the old mans setback kindly observed the sympathizing blacksmith
Praps he was sweet on Dolores himself suggested the sceptical
expressman

It was a bright morning a week after this occurrence that Miss Jo
Folinsbee stepped from her garden into the road This time the latch did
not click as she cautiously closed the gate behind her After a moments
irresolution which would have been awkward but that it was charmingly
employed after the manner of her sex in adjusting a bow under a
dimpled but rather prominent chin and in pulling down the fingers of
a neatly fitting glove she tripped toward the settlement Small wonder
that a passing teamster drove his six mules into the wayside ditch and
imperilled his load to keep the dust from her spotless garments small
wonder that the Lightning Express withheld its speed and flash to let
her pass and that the expressman who had never been known to exchange
more than rapid monosyllables with his fellowman gazed after her with
breathless admiration For she was certainly attractive In a country
where the ornamental sex followed the example of youthful Nature and
were prone to overdress and glaring efflorescence Miss Jos simple
and tasteful raiment added much to the physical charm of if it did
not actually suggest a sentiment to her presence It is said that
Euchredeck Billy working in the gulch at the crossing never saw
Miss Folinsbee pass but that he always remarked apologetically to his
partner that he believed he MUST write a letter home Even Bill
Masters who saw her in Paris presented to the favorable criticism of
that most fastidious man the late Emperor said that she was stunning
but a big discount on what she was at Madrono Hollow

It was still early morning but the sun with California extravagance
had already begun to beat hotly on the little chip hat and blue ribbons
and Miss Jo was obliged to seek the shade of a bypath Here she
received the timid advances of a vagabond yellow dog graciously until
emboldened by his success he insisted upon accompanying her and
becoming slobberingly demonstrative threatened her spotless skirt with
his dusty paws when she drove him from her with some slight acerbity
and a stone which haply fell within fifty feet of its destined mark
Having thus proved her ability to defend herself with characteristic
inconsistency she took a small panic and gathering her white skirts in
one hand and holding the brim of her hat over her eyes with the other
she ran swiftly at least a hundred yards before she stopped Then she
began picking some ferns and a few wildflowers still spared to the
withered fields and then a sudden distrust of her small ankles seized
her and she inspected them narrowly for those burrs and bugs and snakes
which are supposed to lie in wait for helpless womanhood Then she
plucked some golden heads of wild oats and with a sudden inspiration
placed them in her black hair and then came quite unconsciously upon
the trail leading to Madrono Hollow

Here she hesitated Before her ran the little trail vanishing at last
into the bosky depths below The sun was very hot She must be very far
from home Why should she not rest awhile under the shade of a madrono

She answered these questions by going there at once After thoroughly
exploring the grove and satisfying herself that it contained no other
living human creature she sat down under one of the largest trees with
a satisfactory little sigh Miss Jo loved the madrono It was a cleanly
tree no dust ever lay upon its varnished leaves its immaculate shade
never was known to harbor grub or insect

She looked up at the rosy arms interlocked and arched above her head
She looked down at the delicate ferns and cryptogams at her feet
Something glittered at the root of the tree She picked it up it was a
bracelet She examined it carefully for cipher or inscription there was
none She could not resist a natural desire to clasp it on her arm
and to survey it from that advantageous viewpoint This absorbed her
attention for some moments and when she looked up again she beheld at a
little distance Culpepper Starbottle

He was standing where he had halted with instinctive delicacy on first
discovering her Indeed he had even deliberated whether he ought not
to go away without disturbing her But some fascination held him to the
spot Wonderful power of humanity Far beyond jutted an outlying spur of
the Sierra vast compact and silent Scarcely a hundred yards away a
leaguelong chasm dropped its sheer walls of granite a thousand feet On
every side rose up the serried ranks of pinetrees in whose closeset
files centuries of storm and change had wrought no breach Yet all this
seemed to Culpepper to have been planned by an allwise Providence as
the natural background to the figure of a pretty girl in a yellow dress

Although Miss Jo had confidently expected to meet Culpepper somewhere
in her ramble now that he came upon her suddenly she felt disappointed
and embarrassed His manner too was more than usually grave and
serious and more than ever seemed to jar upon that audacious levity
which was this giddy girls power and security in a society where all
feeling was dangerous As he approached her she rose to her feet but
almost before she knew it he had taken her hand and drawn her to a seat
beside him This was not what Miss Jo had expected but nothing is so
difficult to predicate as the exact preliminaries of a declaration of
love

What did Culpepper say Nothing I fear that will add anything to
the wisdom of the reader nothing I fear that Miss Jo had not
heard substantially from other lips before But there was a certain
conviction firespeed and fury in the manner that was deliciously
novel to the young lady It was certainly something to be courted in
the nineteenth century with all the passion and extravagance of the
sixteenth it was something to hear amid the slang of a frontier
society the language of knighterrantry poured into her ear by this
lanternjawed darkbrowed descendant of the Cavaliers

I do not know that there was anything more in it The facts however go
to show that at a certain point Miss Jo dropped her glove and that in
recovering it Culpepper possessed himself first of her hand and then her
lips When they stood up to go Culpepper had his arm around her waist
and her black hair with its sheaf of golden oats rested against the
breast pocket of his coat But even then I do not think her fancy was
entirely captive She took a certain satisfaction in this demonstration
of Culpeppers splendid height and mentally compared it with a former
flame one lieutenant McMirk an active but undersized Hector who
subsequently fell a victim to the incautiously composed and monotonous
beverages of a frontier garrison Nor was she so much preoccupied but
that her quick eyes even while absorbing Culpeppers glances were yet
able to detect at a distance the figure of a man approaching In an
instant she slipped out of Culpeppers arm and whipping her hands
behind her said Theres that horrid man

Culpepper looked up and beheld his respected uncle panting and blowing
over the hill His brow contracted as he turned to Miss Jo You dont
like my uncle

I hate him Miss Jo was recovering her ready tongue

Culpepper blushed He would have liked to enter upon some details of the
Colonels pedigree and exploits but there was not time He only smiled
sadly The smile melted Miss Jo She held out her hand quickly and said
with even more than her usual effrontery Dont let that man get you
into any trouble Take care of yourself dear and dont let anything
happen to you

Miss Jo intended this speech to be pathetic the tenure of life among
her lovers had hitherto been very uncertain Culpepper turned toward
her but she had already vanished in the thicket

The Colonel came up panting Ive looked all over town for you and be
dashed to you sir Who was that with you

A lady Culpepper never lied but he was discreet

Dm em all Look yar Culp Ive spotted the man who gave the order
to put me off the floor flo was what the Colonel said the other
night

Who was it asked Culpepper listlessly

Jack Folinsbee

Who

Why the son of that dashed niggerworshipping psalmsinging Puritan
Yankee Whats the matter now Look yar Culp you aint goin back on
your blood ar ye You aint goin back on your word Ye aint going
down at the feet of this trash like a whipped hound

Culpepper was silent He was very white Presently he looked up and said
quietly No


Culpepper Starbottle had challenged Jack Folinsbee and the challenge
was accepted The cause alleged was the expelling of Culpeppers uncle
from the floor of the Assembly Ball by the order of Folinsbee This much
Madrono Hollow knew and could swear to but there were other strange
rumors afloat of which the blacksmith was an able expounder You see
gentlemen he said to the crowd gathered around his anvil I aint
got no theory of this affair I only give a few facts as have come to
my knowledge Culpepper and Jack meets quite accidental like in Bobs
saloon Jack goes up to Culpepper and says A word with you Culpepper
bows and steps aside in this way Jack standing about HERE The
blacksmith demonstrates the position of the parties with two old
horseshoes on the anvil Jack pulls a bracelet from his pocket and
says Do you know that bracelet Culpepper says I do not quite
coollike and easy Jack says You gave it to my sister Culpepper
says still cool as you please I did not Jack says You lie Gd
dmn you and draws his derringer Culpepper jumps forward about here
reference is made to the diagram and Jack fires Nobody hit Its
a mighty curos thing gentlemen continued the blacksmith
dropping suddenly into the abstract and leaning meditatively on his
anvilits a mighty curos thing that nobody gets hit so often You
and me empties our revolvers sociably at each other over a little game
and the room full and nobody gets hit Thats what gets me

Never mind Thompson chimed in Bill Masters theres another and a
better world where we shall know all that andbecome better shots Go
on with your story

Well some grabs Culpepper and some grabs Jack and so separates them
Then Jack tells em as how he had seen his sister wear a bracelet which
he knew was one that had been given to Dolores by Colonel Starbottle
That Miss Jo wouldnt say where she got it but owned up to having seen
Culpepper that day Then the most curos thing of it yet what does
Culpepper do but rise up and takes all back that he said and allows
that he DID give her the bracelet Now my opinion gentlemen is that he
lied it aint like that man to give a gal that he respects anything off
of that piece Dolores But its all the same now and theres but one
thing to be done

The way this one thing was done belongs to the record of Madrono Hollow
The morning was bright and clear the air was slightly chill but that
was from the mist which arose along the banks of the river As early
as six oclock the designated grounda little opening in the madrono
grovewas occupied by Culpepper Starbottle Colonel Starbottle his
second and the surgeon The Colonel was exalted and excited albeit
in a rather imposing dignified way and pointed out to the surgeon the
excellence of the ground which at that hour was wholly shaded from the
sun whose steady stare is more or less discomposing to your duellist
The surgeon threw himself on the grass and smoked his cigar Culpepper
quiet and thoughtful leaned against a tree and gazed up the river
There was a strange suggestion of a picnic about the group which was
heightened when the Colonel drew a bottle from his coattails and
taking a preliminary draught offered it to the others Cocktails
sir he explained with dignified precision A gentleman sir should
never go out without em Keeps off the morning chill I remember going
out in 53 with Hank Boompirater Good ged sir the man had to put on
his overcoat and was shot in it Fact

But the noise of wheels drowned the Colonels reminiscences and a
rapidly driven buggy containing Jack Folinsbee Calhoun Bungstarter
his second and Bill Masters drew up on the ground Jack Folinsbee
leaped out gayly I had the jolliest work to get away without the
governors hearing he began addressing the group before him with the
greatest volubility Calhoun Bungstarter touched his arm and the young
man blushed It was his first duel

If you are ready gentlemen said Mr Bungstarter we had better
proceed to business I believe it is understood that no apology will be
offered or accepted We may as well settle preliminaries at once or
I fear we shall be interrupted There is a rumor in town that the
Vigilance Committee are seeking our friends the Starbottles and I
believe as their fellowcountryman I have the honor to be included in
their warrant

At this probability of interruption that gravity which had hitherto
been wanting fell upon the group The preliminaries were soon arranged
and the principals placed in position Then there was a silence

To a spectator from the hill impressed with the picnic suggestion what
might have been the popping of two champagne corks broke the stillness

Culpepper had fired in the air Colonel Starbottle uttered a low curse
Jack Folinsbee sulkily demanded another shot

Again the parties stood opposed to each other Again the word was given
and what seemed to be the simultaneous report of both pistols rose upon
the air But after an interval of a few seconds all were surprised to
see Culpepper slowly raise his unexploded weapon and fire it harmlessly
above his head Then throwing the pistol upon the ground he walked to
a tree and leaned silently against it

Jack Folinsbee flew into a paroxysm of fury Colonel Starbottle raved
and swore Mr Bungstarter was properly shocked at their conduct
Really gentlemen if Mr Culpepper Starbottle declines another shot I
do not see how we can proceed

But the Colonels blood was up and Jack Folinsbee was equally
implacable A hurried consultation ensued which ended by Colonel
Starbottle taking his nephews place as principal Bill Masters acting
as second vice Mr Bungstarter who declined all further connection
with the affair

Two distinct reports rang through the Hollow Jack Folinsbee dropped his
smoking pistol took a step forward and then dropped heavily upon his
face

In a moment the surgeon was at his side The confusion was heightened
by the trampling of hoofs and the voice of the blacksmith bidding them
flee for their lives before the coming storm A moment more and the
ground was cleared and the surgeon looking up beheld only the white
face of Culpepper bending over him

Can you save him

I cannot say Hold up his head a moment while I run to the buggy

Culpepper passed his arm tenderly around the neck of the insensible man
Presently the surgeon returned with some stimulants

There that will do Mr Starbottle thank you Now my advice is to get
away from here while you can Ill look after Folinsbee Do you hear

Culpeppers arm was still round the neck of his late foe but his head
had drooped and fallen on the wounded mans shoulder The surgeon looked
down and catching sight of his face stooped and lifted him gently
in his arms He opened his coat and waistcoat There was blood upon his
shirt and a bullethole in his breast He had been shot unto death at
the first fire




THE POET OF SIERRA FLAT


As the enterprising editor of the Sierra Flat Record stood at his case
setting type for his next weeks paper he could not help hearing the
woodpeckers who were busy on the roof above his head It occurred to
him that possibly the birds had not yet learned to recognize in the rude
structure any improvement on nature and this idea pleased him so much
that he incorporated it in the editorial article which he was then
doubly composing For the editor was also printer of the Record
and although that remarkable journal was reputed to exert a power felt
through all Calaveras and a greater part of Tuolumne County strict
economy was one of the conditions of its beneficent existence

Thus preoccupied he was startled by the sudden irruption of a small
roll of manuscript which was thrown through the open door and fell at
his feet He walked quickly to the threshold and looked down the tangled
trail which led to the highroad But there was nothing to suggest the
presence of his mysterious contributor A hare limped slowly away a
greenandgold lizard paused upon a pine stump the woodpeckers ceased
their work So complete had been his sylvan seclusion that he found
it difficult to connect any human agency with the act rather the hare
seemed to have an inexpressibly guilty look the woodpeckers to maintain
a significant silence and the lizard to be consciencestricken into
stone

An examination of the manuscript however corrected this injustice to
defenceless nature It was evidently of human originbeing verse
and of exceeding bad quality The editor laid it aside As he did so he
thought he saw a face at the window Sallying out in some indignation
he penetrated the surrounding thicket in every direction but his search
was as fruitless as before The poet if it were he was gone

A few days after this the editorial seclusion was invaded by voices of
alternate expostulation and entreaty Stepping to the door the editor
was amazed at beholding Mr Morgan McCorkle a wellknown citizen of
Angelo and a subscriber to the Record in the act of urging partly
by force and partly by argument an awkward young man toward the
building When he had finally effected his object and as it were
safely landed his prize in a chair Mr McCorkle took off his hat
carefully wiped the narrow isthmus of forehead which divided his black
brows from his stubby hair and with an explanatory wave of his hand
toward his reluctant companion said A borned poet and the cussedest
fool you ever seed

Accepting the editors smile as a recognition of the introduction Mr
McCorkle panted and went on Didnt want to come Mister Editor dont
went to see me Morg sez he Milt sez I he do a borned poet like
you and a gifted genius like he oughter come together sociable And I
fetched him Ah will yer The born poet had after exhibiting signs
of great distress started to run But Mr McCorkle was down upon him
instantly seizing him by his long linen coat and settled him back in
his chair Taint no use stampeding Yer ye are and yer ye stays For
yer a borned poetef ye are as shy as a jackass rabbit Look at im
now

He certainly was not an attractive picture There was hardly a notable
feature in his weak face except his eyes which were moist and shy and
not unlike the animal to which Mr McCorkle had compared him It was the
face that the editor had seen at the window

Knowed him for fower yearsince he war a boy continued Mr McCorkle
in a loud whisper Allers the same bless you Can jerk a rhyme as easy
as turnin jack Never had any eddication lived out in Missooray all
his life But hes chock full o poetry Ony this mornin sez I to
himhe camps along o meMilt sez I are breakfast ready and
he up and answers back quite peert and chipper The breakfast it is
ready and the birds is singing free and its risin in the dawnin
light is happiness to me When a man said Mr McCorkle dropping his
voice with deep solemnity gets off things like them without any
call to do it and handlin flapjacks over a cookstove at the same
timethat mans a borned poet

There was an awkward pause Mr McCorkle beamed patronizingly on
his protege The born poet looked as if he were meditating another
flightnot a metaphorical one The editor asked if he could do
anything for them

In course you can responded Mr McCorkle thats jest it Milt
wheres that poetry

The editors countenance fell as the poet produced from his pocket a
roll of manuscript He however took it mechanically and glanced over
it It was evidently a duplicate of the former mysterious contribution

The editor then spoke briefly but earnestly I regret that I cannot
recall his exact words but it appeared that never before in the
history of the Record had the pressure been so great upon its
columns Matters of paramount importance deeply affecting the material
progress of Sierra questions touching the absolute integrity of
Calaveras and Tuolumne as social communities were even now waiting
expression Weeks nay months must elapse before that pressure would
be removed and the Record could grapple with any but the sternest of
topics Again the editor had noticed with pain the absolute decline
of poetry in the foothills of the Sierras Even the works of Byron and
Moore attracted no attention in Dutch Flat and a prejudice seemed to
exist against Tennyson in Grass Valley But the editor was not without
hope for the future In the course of four or five years when the
country was settled

What would be the cost to print this yer interrupted Mr McCorkle
quietly

About fifty dollars as an advertisement responded the editor with
cheerful alacrity

Mr McCorkle placed the sum in the editors hand Yer see thets what
I sez to Milt Milt sez I pay as you go for you are a borned
poet Hevin no call to write but doin it free and spontaneous like in
course you pays Thets why Mr Editor never printed your poetry

What name shall I put to it asked the editor

Milton

It was the first word that the born poet had spoken during the
interview and his voice was so very sweet and musical that the editor
looked at him curiously and wondered if he had a sister

Milton is that all

Thets his furst name exclaimed Mr McCorkle

The editor here suggested that as there had been another poet of that
name

Milt might be took for him Thets bad reflected Mr McCorkle with
simple gravity Well put down his hull nameMilton Chubbuck

The editor made a note of the fact Ill set it up now he said This
was also a hint that the interview was ended The poet and patron arm
in arm drew towards the door In next weeks paper said the editor
smilingly in answer to the childlike look of inquiry in the eyes of the
poet and in another moment they were gone

The editor was as good as his word He straightway betook himself to
his case and unrolling the manuscript began his task The woodpeckers
on the roof recommenced theirs and in a few moments the former sylvan
seclusion was restored There was no sound in the barren barnlike room
but the birds above and below the click of the composingrule as the
editor marshalled the types into lines in his stick and arrayed them in
solid column on the galley Whatever might have been his opinion of the
copy before him there was no indication of it in his face which wore
the stolid indifference of his craft Perhaps this was unfortunate for
as the day wore on and the level rays of the sun began to pierce the
adjacent thicket they sought out and discovered an anxious ambushed
figure drawn up beside the editors windowa figure that had sat
there motionless for hours Within the editor worked on as steadily and
impassively as Fate And without the born poet of Sierra Flat sat and
watched him as waiting its decree


The effect of the poem on Sierra Flat was remarkable and unprecedented
The absolute vileness of its doggerel the gratuitous imbecility of its
thought and above all the crowning audacity of the fact that it was
the work of a citizen and published in the county paper brought it
instantly into popularity For many months Calaveras had languished for
a sensation since the last vigilance committee nothing had transpired
to dispel the listless ennui begotten of stagnant business and growing
civilization In more prosperous moments the office of the Record
would have been simply gutted and the editor deported at present the
paper was in such demand that the edition was speedily exhausted In
brief the poem of Mr Milton Chubbuck came like a special providence
to Sierra Flat It was read by campfires in lonely cabins in
flaring barrooms and noisy saloons and declaimed from the boxes of
stagecoaches It was sung in Poker Flat with the addition of a local
chorus and danced as an unhallowed rhythmic dance by the Pyrrhic
phalanx of One Horse Gulch known as The Festive Stags of Calaveras
Some unhappy ambiguities of expression gave rise to many new readings
notes and commentaries which I regret to state were more often
marked by ingenuity than delicacy of thought or expression

Never before did poet acquire such sudden local reputation From the
seclusion of McCorkles cabin and the obscurity of culinary labors he
was haled forth into the glowing sunshine of Fame The name of Chubbuck
was written in letters of chalk on unpainted walls and carved with a
pick on the sides of tunnels A drink known variously as The Chubbuck
Tranquillizer or The Chubbuck Exalter was dispensed at the
bars For some weeks a rude design for a Chubbuck statue made up of
illustrations from circus and melodeon posters representing the genius
of Calaveras in brief skirts on a flying steed in the act of crowning
the poet Chubbuck was visible at Keelers Ferry The poet himself was
overborne with invitations to drink and extravagant congratulations
The meeting between Colonel Starbottle of Siskyion and Chubbuck as
previously arranged by our Boston late of Roaring Camp is said to
have been indescribably affecting The Colonel embraced him unsteadily
I could not return to my constituents at Siskyion sir if this hand
which has grasped that of the gifted Prentice and the lamented Poe
should not have been honored by the touch of the godlike Chubbuck
Gentlemen American literature is looking up Thank you I will take
sugar in mine It was Boston who indited letters of congratulations
from H W Longfellow Tennyson and Browning to Mr Chubbuck
deposited them in the Sierra Flat postoffice and obligingly consented
to dictate the replies

The simple faith and unaffected delight with which these manifestations
were received by the poet and his patron might have touched the hearts
of these grim masters of irony but for the sudden and equal development
in both of the variety of weak natures Mr McCorkle basked in the
popularity of his protege and became alternately supercilious or
patronizing toward the dwellers of Sierra Flat while the poet with
hair carefully oiled and curled and bedecked with cheap jewelry and
flaunting neckhandkerchief paraded himself before the single hotel
As may be imagined this new disclosure of weakness afforded intense
satisfaction to Sierra Flat gave another lease of popularity to the
poet and suggested another idea to the facetious Boston

At that time a young lady popularly and professionally known as the
California Pet was performing to enthusiastic audiences in the
interior Her specialty lay in the personation of youthful masculine
character as a gamin of the street she was irresistible as a
negrodancer she carried the honest miners heart by storm A saucy
pretty brunette she had preserved a wonderful moral reputation even
under the Jovelike advances of showers of gold that greeted her
appearance on the stage at Sierra Flat A prominent and delighted member
of that audience was Milton Chubbuck He attended every night Every
day he lingered at the door of the Union Hotel for a glimpse of the
California Pet It was not long before he received a note
from herin Bostons most popular and approved female
handacknowledging his admiration It was not long before Boston was
called upon to indite a suitable reply At last in furtherance of his
facetious design it became necessary for Boston to call upon the
young actress herself and secure her personal participation To her
he unfolded a plan the successful carrying out of which he felt would
secure his fame to posterity as a practical humorist The California
Pets black eyes sparkled approvingly and mischievously She only
stipulated that she should see the man firsta concession to her
feminine weakness which years of dancing Juba and wearing trousers and
boots had not wholly eradicated from her wilful breast By all means it
should be done And the interview was arranged for the next week

It must not be supposed that during this interval of popularity Mr
Chubbuck had been unmindful of his poetic qualities A certain portion
of each day he was absent from towna communin with natur as Mr
McCorkle expressed itand actually wandering in the mountain trails
or lying on his back under the trees or gathering fragrant herbs and
the brightcolored berries of the Marzanita These and his company he
generally brought to the editors office late in the afternoon
often to that enterprising journalists infinite weariness Quiet and
uncommunicative he would sit there patiently watching him at his work
until the hour for closing the office arrived when he would as quietly
depart There was something so humble and unobtrusive in these visits
that the editor could not find it in his heart to deny them and
accepting them like the woodpeckers as a part of his sylvan
surroundings often forgot even his presence Once or twice moved by
some beauty of expression in the moist shy eyes he felt like seriously
admonishing his visitor of his idle folly but his glance falling upon
the oiled hair and the gorgeous necktie he invariably thought better of
it The case was evidently hopeless

The interview between Mr Chubbuck and the California Pet took place
in a private room of the Union Hotel propriety being respected by
the presence of that archhumorist Boston To this gentleman we are
indebted for the only true account of the meeting However reticent
Mr Chubbuck might have been in the presence of his own sex toward the
fairer portion of humanity he was like most poets exceedingly voluble
Accustomed as the California Pet had been to excessive compliment she
was fairly embarrassed by the extravagant praises of her visitor Her
personation of boy characters her dancing of the champion jig were
particularly dwelt upon with fervid but unmistakable admiration
At last recovering her audacity and emboldened by the presence of
Boston the California Pet electrified her hearers by demanding
half jestingly half viciously if it were as a boy or a girl that she
was the subject of his flattering admiration

That knocked him out o time said the delighted Boston in his
subsequent account of the interview But do you believe the dd
fool actually asked her to take him with her wanted to engage in the
company

The plan as briefly unfolded by Boston was to prevail upon Mr
Chubbuck to make his appearance in costume already designed and
prepared by the inventor before a Sierra Flat audience and recite
an original poem at the Hall immediately on the conclusion of the
California Pets performance At a given signal the audience were to
rise and deliver a volley of unsavory articles previously provided by
the originator of the scheme then a select few were to rush on the
stage seize the poet and after marching him in triumphal procession
through town were to deposit him beyond its uttermost limits with
strict injunctions never to enter it again To the first part of the
plan the poet was committed for the latter portion it was easy enough
to find participants

The eventful night came and with it an audience that packed the long
narrow room with one dense mass of human beings The California Pet
never had been so joyous so reckless so fascinating and audacious
before But the applause was tame and weak compared to the ironical
outburst that greeted the second rising of the curtain and the entrance
of the born poet of Sierra Flat Then there was a hush of expectancy
and the poet stepped to the footlights and stood with his manuscript in
his hand

His face was deadly pale Either there was some suggestion of his fate
in the faces of his audience or some mysterious instinct told him of
his danger He attempted to speak but faltered tottered and staggered
to the wings

Fearful of losing his prey Boston gave the signal and leaped upon
the stage But at the same moment a light figure darted from behind the
scenes and delivering a kick that sent the discomfited humorist back
among the musicians cut a pigeonwing executed a doubleshuffle
and then advancing to the footlights with that inimitable look that
audacious swagger and utter abandon which had so thrilled and fascinated
them a moment before uttered the characteristic speech Wot are you
goin to hit a man fur when hes down saay

The look the drawl the action the readiness and above all the
downright courage of the little woman had its effect A roar of
sympathetic applause followed the act Cut and run while you can she
whispered hurriedly over her one shoulder without altering the others
attitude of pert and saucy defiance toward the audience But even as she
spoke the poet tottered and sank fainting upon the stage Then she threw
a despairing whisper behind the scenes Ring down the curtain

There was a slight movement of opposition in the audience but among
them rose the burly shoulders of Yuba Bill the tall erect figure of
Henry York of Sandy Bar and the colorless determined face of John
Oakhurst The curtain came down

Behind it knelt the California Pet beside the prostrate poet Bring
me some water Run for a doctor Stop CLEAR OUT ALL OF YOU

She had unloosed the gaudy cravat and opened the shirtcollar of the
insensible figure before her Then she burst into an hysterical laugh

Manuela

Her tiringwoman a Mexican halfbreed came toward her

Help me with him to my dressingroom quick then stand outside and
wait If any one questions you tell them hes gone Do you hear HEs
gone

The old woman did as she was bade In a few moments the audience had
departed Before morning so also had the California Pet Manuela
andthe poet of Sierra Flat

But alas with them also had departed the fair fame of the California
Pet Only a few and these it is to be feared of not the best moral
character themselves still had faith in the stainless honor of their
favorite actress It was a mighty foolish thing to do but itll all
come out right yet On the other hand a majority gave her full credit
and approbation for her undoubted pluck and gallantry but deplored that
she should have thrown it away upon a worthless object To elect for
a lover the despised and ridiculed vagrant of Sierra Flat who had not
even the manliness to stand up in his own defence was not only evidence
of inherent moral depravity but was an insult to the community Colonel
Starbottle saw in it only another instance of the extreme frailty of the
sex he had known similar cases and remembered distinctly sir how a
wellknown Philadelphia heiress one of the finest women that ever rode
in her kerridge that gad sir had thrown over a Southern member of
Congress to consort with a dd nigger The Colonel had also noticed a
singular look in the dogs eye which he did not entirely fancy He would
not say anything against the lady sir but he had noticedAnd here
haply the Colonel became so mysterious and darkly confidential as to be
unintelligible and inaudible to the bystanders

A few days after the disappearance of Mr Chubbuck a singular report
reached Sierra Flat and it was noticed that Boston who since the
failure of his elaborate joke had been even more depressed in spirits
than is habitual with great humorists suddenly found that his presence
was required in San Francisco But as yet nothing but the vaguest
surmises were afloat and nothing definite was known

It was a pleasant afternoon when the editor of the Sierra Flat Record
looked up from his case and beheld the figure of Mr Morgan McCorkle
standing in the doorway There was a distressed look on the face of
that worthy gentleman that at once enlisted the editors sympathizing
attention He held an open letter in his hand as he advanced toward the
middle of the room

As a man as has allers borne a fair reputation began Mr McCorkle
slowly I should like if so be as I could Mister Editor to make a
correction in the columns of your valooable paper

Mr Editor begged him to proceed

Ye may not disremember that about a month ago I fetched here what so be
as well call a young man whose name might be as it were MiltonMilton
Chubbuck

Mr Editor remembered perfectly

Thet same party Id knowed better nor fower year two on em campin
out together Not that Id known him all the time fur he war shy and
strange at spells and had odd ways that I took war natral to a borned
poet Ye may remember that I said he was a borned poet

The editor distinctly did

I picked this same party up in St Jo takin a fancy to his face and
kinder calklating hed runnd away from homefor Im a married man
Mr Editor and hev children of my ownand thinkin belike he was a
borned poet

Well said the editor

And as I said before I should like now to make a correction in the
columns of your valooable paper

What correction asked the editor

I said ef you remember my words as how he was a borned poet

Yes

From statements in this yer letter it seems as how I war wrong

Well

She war a woman




THE CHRISTMAS GIFT THAT CAME TO RUPERT


A STORY FOR LITTLE SOLDIERS


It was the Christmas season in Californiaa season of falling rain and
springing grasses There were intervals when through driving clouds and
flying scud the sun visited the haggard hills with a miracle and death
and resurrection were as one and out of the very throes of decay a
joyous life struggled outward and upward Even the storms that swept
down the dead leaves nurtured the tender buds that took their places
There were no episodes of snowy silence over the quickening fields the
farmers ploughshare hard followed the furrows left by the latest rains
Perhaps it was for this reason that the Christmas evergreens which
decorated the drawingroom took upon themselves a foreign aspect and
offered a weird contrast to the roses seen dimly through the windows
as the southwest wind beat their soft faces against the panes


Now said the Doctor drawing his chair closer to the fire and
looking mildly but firmly at the semicircle of flaxen heads around him
I want it distinctly understood before I begin my story that I am not
to be interrupted by any ridiculous questions At the first one I shall
stop At the second I shall feel it my duty to administer a dose of
castoroil all around The boy that moves his legs or arms will be
understood to invite amputation I have brought my instruments with me
and never allow pleasure to interfere with my business Do you promise

Yes sir said six small voices simultaneously The volley was
however followed by half a dozen dropping questions

Silence Bob put your feet down and stop rattling that sword Flora
shall sit by my side like a little lady and be an example to the rest
Fung Tang shall stay too if he likes Now turn down the gas a little
there that will dojust enough to make the fire look brighter and to
show off the Christmas candles Silence everybody The boy who cracks
an almond or breathes too loud over his raisins will be put out of the
room

There was a profound silence Bob laid his sword tenderly aside and
nursed his leg thoughtfully Flora after coquettishly adjusting the
pocket of her little apron put her arm upon the Doctors shoulder and
permitted herself to be drawn beside him Fung Tang the little heathen
page who was permitted on this rare occasion to share the Christian
revels in the drawingroom surveyed the group with a smile that was at
once sweet and philosophical The light ticking of a French clock on the
mantel supported by a young shepherdess of bronze complexion and great
symmetry of limb was the only sound that disturbed the Christmaslike
peace of the apartmenta peace which held the odors of evergreens new
toys cedarboxes glue and varnish in an harmonious combination that
passed all understanding

About four years ago at this time began the Doctor I attended
a course of lectures in a certain city One of the professors
who was a sociable kindly manthough somewhat practical and
hardheadedinvited me to his house on Christmas night I was very
glad to go as I was anxious to see one of his sons who though only
twelve years old was said to be very clever I dare not tell you how
many Latin verses this little fellow could recite or how many English
ones he had composed In the first place youd want me to repeat them
secondly Im not a judge of poetry Latin or English But there were
judges who said they were wonderful for a boy and everybody predicted
a splendid future for him Everybody but his father He shook his head
doubtingly whenever it was mentioned for as I have told you he was a
practical matteroffact man

There was a pleasant party at the Professors that night All the
children of the neighborhood were there and among them the Professors
clever son Rupert as they called hima thin little chap about as
tall as Bobby there and as fair and delicate as Flora by my side His
health was feeble his father said he seldom ran about and played with
other boys preferring to stay at home and brood over his books and
compose what he called his verses

Well we had a Christmastree just like this and we had been laughing
and talking calling off the names of the children who had presents
on the tree and everybody was very happy and joyous when one of the
children suddenly uttered a cry of mingled surprise and hilarity and
said Heres something for Rupert and what do you think it is

We all guessed A desk A copy of Milton A gold pen A rhyming
dictionary No what then

A drum

A what asked everybody

A drum with Ruperts name on it

Sure enough there it was A goodsized bright new brassbound drum
with a slip of paper on it with the inscription FOR RUPERT

Of course we all laughed and thought it a good joke You see youre
to make a noise in the world Rupert said one Heres parchment for
the poet said another Ruperts last work in sheepskin covers said
a third Give us a classical tune Rupert said a fourth and so on
But Rupert seemed too mortified to speak he changed color bit his
lips and finally burst into a passionate fit of crying and left the
room Then those who had joked him felt ashamed and everybody began
to ask who had put the drum there But no one knew or if they did the
unexpected sympathy awakened for the sensitive boy kept them silent
Even the servants were called up and questioned but no one could
give any idea where it came from And what was still more singular
everybody declared that up to the moment it was produced no one had
seen it hanging on the tree What do I think Well I have my own
opinion But no questions Enough for you to know that Rupert did not
come down stairs again that night and the party soon after broke up

I had almost forgotten those things for the war of the Rebellion
broke out the next spring and I was appointed surgeon in one of the
new regiments and was on my way to the seat of war But I had to pass
through the city where the Professor lived and there I met him My
first question was about Rupert The Professor shook his head sadly
Hes not so well he said he has been declining since last
Christmas when you saw him A very strange case he added giving it
a long Latin namea very singular case But go and see him yourself
he urged it may distract his mind and do him good

I went accordingly to the Professors house and found Rupert lying on
a sofa propped up with pillows Around him were scattered his books
and what seemed in singular contrast that drum I told you about was
hanging on a nail just above his head His face was thin and wasted
there was a red spot on either cheek and his eyes were very bright and
widely opened He was glad to see me and when I told him where I was
going he asked a thousand questions about the war I thought I had
thoroughly diverted his mind from its sick and languid fancies when he
suddenly grasped my hand and drew me toward him

Doctor said he in a low whisper you wont laugh at me if I tell
you something

No certainly not I said

You remember that drum he said pointing to the glittering toy that
hung against the wall You know too how it came to me A few weeks
after Christmas I was lying half asleep here and the drum was hanging
on the wall when suddenly I heard it beaten at first low and slowly
then faster and louder until its rolling filled the house In the
middle of the night I heard it again I did not dare to tell anybody
about it but I have heard it every night ever since

He paused and looked anxiously in my face Sometimes he continued
it is played softly sometimes loudly but always quickening to a
longroll so loud and alarming that I have looked to see people coming
into my room to ask what was the matter But I think DoctorI think
he repeated slowly looking up with painful interest into my face that
no one hears it but myself

I thought so too but I asked him if he had heard it at any other
time

Once or twice in the daytime he replied when I have been reading
or writing then very loudly as though it were angry and tried in that
way to attract my attention away from my books

I looked into his face and placed my hand upon his pulse His eyes
were very bright and his pulse a little flurried and quick I then
tried to explain to him that he was very weak and that his senses were
very acute as most weak peoples are and how that when he read
or grew interested and excited or when he was tired at night the
throbbing of a big artery made the beating sound he heard He listened
to me with a sad smile of unbelief but thanked me and in a little
while I went away But as I was going down stairs I met the Professor
I gave him my opinion of the casewell no matter what it was

He wants fresh air and exercise said the Professor and some
practical experience of life sir The Professor was not a bad man but
he was a little worried and impatient and thoughtas clever people are
apt to thinkthat things which he didnt understand were either silly
or improper

I left the city that very day and in the excitement of battlefields
and hospitals I forgot all about little Rupert nor did I hear of him
again until one day meeting an old classmate in the army who had
known the Professor he told me that Rupert had become quite insane and
that in one of his paroxysms he had escaped from the house and as he
had never been found it was feared that he had fallen in the river and
was drowned I was terribly shocked for the moment as you may imagine
but dear me I was living just then among scenes as terrible and
shocking and I had little time to spare to mourn over poor Rupert

It was not long after receiving this intelligence that we had a
terrible battle in which a portion of our army was surprised and driven
back with great slaughter I was detached from my brigade to ride over
to the battlefield and assist the surgeons of the beaten division who
had more on their hands than they could attend to When I reached the
barn that served for a temporary hospital I went at once to work Ah
Bob said the Doctor thoughtfully taking the bright sword from the
hands of the halffrightened Bob and holding it gravely before him
these pretty playthings are symbols of cruel ugly realities

I turned to a tall stout Vermonter he continued very slowly tracing
a pattern on the rug with the point of the scabbard who was badly
wounded in both thighs but he held up his hands and begged me to help
others first who needed it more than he I did not at first heed his
request for this kind of unselfishness was very common in the army
but he went on For Gods sake Doctor leave me here there is a
drummerboy of our regimenta mere childdying if he isnt dead now
Go and see him first He lies over there He saved more than one life
He was at his post in the panic this morning and saved the honor of the
regiment I was so much more impressed by the mans manner than by the
substance of his speech which was however corroborated by the other
poor fellows stretched around me that I passed over to where the
drummer lay with his drum beside him I gave one glance at his
faceandyes Bobyes my childrenit WAS Rupert

Well well it needed not the chalked cross which my brothersurgeons
had left upon the rough board whereon he lay to show how urgent was the
relief he sought it needed not the prophetic words of the Vermonter
nor the damp that mingled with the brown curls that clung to his pale
forehead to show how hopeless it was now I called him by name He
opened his eyeslarger I thought in the new vision that was beginning
to dawn upon himand recognized me He whispered Im glad you are
come but I dont think you can do me any good

I could not tell him a lie I could not say anything I only pressed
his hand in mine as he went on

But you will see father and ask him to forgive me Nobody is to blame
but myself It was a long time before I understood why the drum came to
me that Christmas night and why it kept calling to me every night and
what it said I know it now The work is done and I am content Tell
father it is better as it is I should have lived only to worry and
perplex him and something in me tells me this is right

He lay still for a moment and then grasping my hand said

Hark

I listened but heard nothing but the suppressed moans of the wounded
men around me The drum he said faintly dont you hear it The drum
is calling me

He reached out his arm to where it lay as though he would embrace it

Listen he went on its the reveille There are the ranks drawn
up in review Dont you see the sunlight flash down the long line of
bayonets Their faces are shiningthey present armsthere comes the
General but his face I cannot look at for the glory round his head He
sees me he smiles it is And with a name upon his lips that he had
learned long ago he stretched himself wearily upon the planks and lay
quite still


Thats all No questions now never mind what became of the drum Whos
that snivelling Bless my soul wheres my pillbox
