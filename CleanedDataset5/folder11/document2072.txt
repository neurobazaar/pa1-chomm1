MICHAEL

by E F Benson




CHAPTER I


Though there was nothing visibly graceful about Michael Comber he
apparently had the art of giving gracefully He had already told his
cousin Francis who sat on the arm of the sofa by his table that there
was no earthly excuse for his having run into debt but now when the
moment came for giving he wrote the cheque quickly and eagerly as if
thoroughly enjoying it and passed it over to him with a smile that was
extraordinarily pleasant

There you are then Francis he said and I take it from you that
that will put you perfectly square again Youve got to write to me
remember in two days time saying that you have paid those bills And
for the rest Im delighted that you told me about it In fact I should
have been rather hurt if you hadnt

Francis apparently had the art of accepting gracefully which is more
difficult than the feat which Michael had so successfully accomplished

Mike youre a brick he said But then you always are a brick
Thanks awfully

Michael got up and shuffled rather than walked across the room to the
bell by the fireplace As long as he was sitting down his big arms and
broad shoulders gave the impression of strength and you would have
expected to find when he got up that he was tall and largely made But
when he rose the extreme shortness of his legs manifested itself and
he appeared almost deformed His hands hung nearly to his knees he was
heavy short lumpish

But its more blessed to give than to receive Francis he said I
have the best of you there

Well its pretty blessed to receive when you are in a tight place as
I was he said laughing And I am so grateful

Yes I know you are And its that which makes me feel rather cheap
because I dont miss what Ive given you But thats distinctly not a
reason for your doing it again Youll have tea wont you

Why yes said Francis getting up also and leaning his elbow on
the chimneypiece which was nearly on a level with the top of Michaels
head And if Michael had gracefulness only in the art of giving
Franciss gracefulness in receiving was clearly of a piece with the rest
of him He was tall slim and alert with the quick soft movements of
some wild animal His face brown with sunburn and pink with briskgoing
blood was exceedingly handsome in a boyish and almost effeminate
manner and though he was only eighteen months younger than his cousin
he looked as if nine or ten years might have divided their ages

But you are a brick Mike he said again laying his long brown hand
on his cousins shoulder I cant help saying it twice

Twice more than was necessary said Michael finally dismissing the
subject

The room where they sat was in Michaels flat in Half Moon Street and
high up in one of those tall discreetlooking houses The windows were
wide open on this hot July afternoon and the bourdon hum of London
where Piccadilly poured by at the street end came in blended and
blunted by distance but with the suggestion of heat of movement of
hurrying affairs The room was very empty of furniture there was a rug
or two on the parquet floor a long low bookcase taking up the end near
the door a table a sofa three or four chairs and a piano Everything
was plain but equally obviously everything was expensive and the
general impression given was that the owner had no desire to be
surrounded by things he did not want but insisted on the superlative
quality of the things he did The rugs for instance happened to be of
silk the bookcase happened to be Hepplewhite the piano bore the most
eminent of makers names There were three mezzotints on the walls a
dragonsblood vase on the high carved chimneypiece the whole bore
the unmistakable stamp of a fine individual taste

But theres something else I want to talk to you about Francis said
Michael as presently afterwards they sat over their tea I cant say
that I exactly want your advice but I should like your opinion Ive
done something in fact without asking anybody but now that its done
I should like to know what you think about it

Francis laughed

Thats you all over Michael he said You always do a thing first
if you really mean to do itwhich I suppose is moral courageand then
you go anxiously round afterwards to see if other people approve
which I am afraid looks like moral cowardice I go on a different
plan altogether I ascertain the opinion of so many people before I do
anything that I end by forgetting what I wanted to do At least
that seems a reasonable explanation for the fact that I so seldom do
anything

Michael looked affectionately at the handsome boy who lounged
longlegged in the chair opposite him Like many very shy persons he
had one friend with whom he was completely unreserved and that was
this cousin of his for whose charm and insouciant brilliance he had so
adoring an admiration

He pointed a broad big finger at him

Yes but when you are like that he said you can just float along
Other people float you But I should sink heavily if I did nothing Ive
got to swim all the time

Well you are in the army said Francis Thats as much swimming as
anyone expects of a fellow who has expectations In fact its I who
have to swim all the time if you come to think of it You are somebody
Im not

Michael sat up and took a cigarette

But Im not in the army any longer he said Thats just what I am
wanting to tell you

Francis laughed

What do you mean he asked Have you been cashiered or shot or
something

I mean that I wrote and resigned my commission yesterday said
Michael If you had dined with me last nightas by the way you
promised to doI should have told you then

Francis got up and leaned against the chimneypiece He was conscious of
not thinking this abrupt news as important as he felt he ought to think
it That was characteristic of him he floated as Michael had lately
told him finding the world an extremely pleasant place full of warm
currents that took you gently forward without entailing the slightest
exertion But Michaels grave and expectant facethat Michael who had
been so eagerly kind about meeting his debts for himwarned him that
however gossamerlike his own emotions were he must attempt to ballast
himself over this

Are you speaking seriously he asked

Quite seriously I never did anything that was so serious

And that is what you want my opinion about he asked If so you
must tell me more Mike I cant have an opinion unless you give me the
reasons why you did it The thing itselfwell the thing itself doesnt
seem to matter so immensely The significance of it is why you did it

Michaels big heavybrowed face lightened a moment For a fellow who
never thinks he said you think uncommonly well But the reasons are
obvious enough You can guess sufficient reasons to account for it

Lets hear them anyhow said Francis

Michael clouded again

Surely they are obvious he said No one knows better than me unless
it is you that Im not like the rest of you My mind isnt the build of
a guardsmans mind any more than my unfortunate body is Half our work
as you know quite well consists in being pleasant and in liking it
Well Im not pleasant Im not breezy and cordial I cant do it
I make a task of what is a pastime to all of you and I only shuffle
through my task Im not popular Im not liked Its no earthly use
saying I am I dont like the life it seems to me senseless And those
who live it dont like me They think me heavyjust heavy And I have
enough sensitiveness to know it

Michael need not have stated his reasons for his cousin could certainly
have guessed them he could too have confessed to the truth of them
Michael had not the light hand which is so necessary when young men
work together in a companionship of which the cordiality is an essential
part of the work neither had he in the social side of life that
particular and inimitable sort of easy selfconfidence which as he had
said just now enables its owner to float Except in years he was not
young he could not manage to be clubable he was serious and awkward
at a supper party he was altogether without the effervescence which is
necessary in order to avoid flatness He did his work also in the same
conscientious but leaden way officers and men alike felt it All this
Francis knew perfectly well but instead of acknowledging it he tried
quite fruitlessly to smooth it over

Arent you exaggerating he asked

Michael shook his head

Oh dont tone it down Francis he said Even if I was
exaggeratingwhich I dont for a moment admitthe effect on my general
efficiency would be the same I think what I say is true

Francis became more practical

But youve only been in the regiment three years he said It wont
be very popular resigning after only three years

I have nothing much to lose on the score of popularity remarked
Michael

There was nothing pertinent that could be consoling here

And have you told your father asked Francis Does Uncle Robert
know

Yes I wrote to father this morning and Im going down to Ashbridge
tomorrow I shall be very sorry if he disapproves

Then youll be sorry said Francis

I know but it wont make any difference to my action After all Im
twentyfive if I cant begin to manage my life now you may be sure I
never shall But I know Im right I would bet on my infallibility At
present Ive only told you half my reasons for resigning and already
you agree with me

Francis did not contradict this

Lets hear the rest then he said

You shall The rest is far more important and rather resembles a
sermon

Francis appropriately sat down again

Well its this said Michael Im twentyfive and it is time that
I began trying to be what perhaps I may be able to be instead of not
trying very muchbecause its hopelessto be what I cant be Im
going to study music I believe that I could perhaps do something there
and in any case I love it more than anything else And if you love a
thing you have certainly a better chance of succeeding in it than in
something that you dont love at all I was stuck into the army for no
reason except that soldiering is among the few employments which it is
considered proper for fellows in my positiongood Lord how awful it
soundsproper for me to adopt The other things that were open were
that I should be a sailor or a member of Parliament But the soldier was
what father chose I looked round the picture gallery at home the other
day there are twelve Lord Ashbridges in uniform So as I shall be
Lord Ashbridge when father dies I was stuck into uniform too to be the
illstarred thirteenth But what has it all come to If you think of it
when did the majority of them wear their smart uniforms Chiefly when
they went on peaceful parades or to court balls or to the Sir Joshua
Reynolds of the period to be painted Theyve been tin soldiers
Francis Youre a tin soldier and Ive just ceased to be a tin soldier
If there was the smallest chance of being useful in the army by which
I mean standing up and being shot at because I am English I would not
dream of throwing it up But theres no such chance

Michael paused a moment in his sermon and beat out the ashes from his
pipe against the grate

Anyhow the chance is too remote he said All the nations with armies
and navies are too much afraid of each other to do more than growl Also
I happen to want to do something different with my life and you cant
do anything unless you believe in what you are doing I want to leave
behind me something more than the portrait of a tin soldier in the
diningroom at Ashbridge After all isnt an artistic profession
the greatest there is For what counts what is of value in the
world today Greek statues the Italian pictures the symphonies of
Beethoven the plays of Shakespeare The people who have made beautiful
things are they who are the benefactors of mankind At least so the
people who love beautiful things think

Francis glanced at his cousin He knew this interesting vital side of
Michael he was aware too that had anybody except himself been in the
room Michael could not have shown it Perhaps there might be people
to whom he could show it but certainly they were not those among whom
Michaels life was passed

Go on he said encouragingly Youre ripping Mike

Well the nuisance of it is that the things I am ripping about appear
to father to be a sort of indoor game Its all right to play the piano
if its too wet to play golf You can amuse yourself with painting if
there arent any pheasants to shoot In fact he will think that my
wanting to become a musician is much the same thing as if I wanted to
become a billiardmarker And if he and I talked about it till we were a
hundred years old he could never possibly appreciate my point of view

Michael got up and began walking up and down the room with his slow
ponderous movement

Francis its a thousand pities that you and I cant change places he
said You are exactly the son father would like to have and I should
so much prefer being his nephew However you come next thats one
comfort

He paused a moment

You see the fact is that he doesnt like me he said He has no
sympathy whatever with my tastes nor with what I am Im an awful trial
to him and I dont see how to help it Its pure waste of time my
going on in the Guards I do it badly and I hate it Now youre made
for it youre that sort and that sort is my fathers sort But Im
not no one knows that better than myself Then theres the question of
marriage too

Michael gave a mirthless laugh

Im twentyfive you see he said and its the family custom for the
eldest son to marry at twentyfive just as hes baptised when hes a
certain number of weeks old and confirmed when he is fifteen Its part
of the family plan and the Medes and Persians arent in it when the
family plan is in question Then again the lucky young woman has to be
suitable that is to say she must be what my father calls one of us
How I loathe that phrase So my mother has a list of the suitable and
they come down to Ashbridge in gloomy succession and she and I are
sent out to play golf together or go on the river And when to our
unutterable relief that is over we hurry back to the house and I
escape to my piano and she goes and flirts with you if you are there
Dont deny it And then another one comes and she is drearier than the
lastat least I am

Francis lay back and laughed at this dismal picture of the rejection of
the fittest

But youre so confoundedly hard to please Mike he said There was
an awfully nice girl down at Ashbridge at Easter when I was there who
was simply pining to take you Ive forgotten her name

Michael clicked his fingers in a summary manner

There you are he said You and she flirted all the time and three
months afterwards you dont even remember her name If you had only been
me you would have married her As it was she and I bored each other
stiff Theres an irony for you But as for pining I ask you whether
any girl in her senses could pine for me Look at me and tell me Or
rather dont look at me I cant bear to be looked at

Here was one of Michaels morbid sensitivenesses He seldom forgot his
own physical appearance the fact of which was to him appalling His
stumpy figure with its big body his broad bluntfeatured face his
long arms his large hands and feet his clumsiness in movement were to
him of the nature of a constant nightmare and it was only with Francis
and the ease that his solitary presence gave or when he was occupied
with music that he wholly lost his selfconsciousness in this respect
It seemed to him that he must be as repulsive to others as he was to
himself which was a distorted view of the case Plain without doubt he
was and of heavy and ungainly build but his belief in the finality of
his uncouthness was morbid and imaginary and half his inability to get
on with his fellows no less than with the maidens who were brought
down in single file to Ashbridge was due to this He knew very well
how lightheartedly they escaped to the geniality and attractiveness of
Francis and in the clutch of his own introspective temperament he could
not free himself from the handicap of his own sensitiveness and like
others take himself for granted He crushed his own power to please by
the weight of his judgments on himself

So theres another reason to complain of the irony of fate he said
I dont want to marry anybody and God knows nobody wants to marry me
But then its my duty to become the father of another Lord Ashbridge
as if there had not been enough of them already and his mother must
be a certain kind of girl with whom I have nothing in common So I
say that if only we could have changed places you would have filled
my niche so perfectly and I should have been free to bury myself in
Leipzig or Munich and lived like the grub I certainly am and have
drowned myself in a sea of music As it is goodness knows what my
father will say to the letter I wrote him yesterday which he will have
received this morning However that will soon be patent for I go down
there tomorrow I wish you were coming with me Cant you manage to for
a day or two and help things along Aunt Barbara will be there

Francis consulted a small green morocco pocketbook

Cant tomorrow he said nor yet the day after But perhaps I could
get a few days leave next week

Next weeks no use I go to Baireuth next week

Baireuth Whos Baireuth asked Francis

Oh a man I know His other name was Wagner and he wrote some tunes

Francis nodded

Oh but Ive heard of him he said Theyre rather long tunes arent
they At least I found them so when I went to the opera the other night
Go on with your plans Mike What do you mean to do after that

Go on to Munich and hear the same tunes over again After that I shall
come back and settle down in town and study

Play the piano asked Francis amiably trying to enter into his
cousins schemes

Michael laughed

No doubt that will come into it he said But its rather as if
you told somebody you were a soldier and he said Oh is that quick
march

So it is Soldiering largely consists of quick march especially when
its more than usually hot

Well I shall learn to play the piano said Michael

But you play so rippingly already said Francis cordially You played
all those songs the other night which you had never seen before If you
can do that there is nothing more you want to learn with the piano is
there

You are talking rather as father will talk observed Michael

Am I Well I seem to be talking sense

You werent doing what you seemed then Ive got absolutely everything
to learn about the piano

Francis rose

Then it is clear I dont understand anything about it he said Nor
I suppose does Uncle Robert But really I rather envy you Mike
Anyhow you want to do and be something so much that you are gaily going
to face unpleasantnesses with Uncle Robert about it Now I wouldnt
face unpleasantnesses with anybody about anything I wanted to do and I
suppose the reason must be that I dont want to do anything enough

The malady of not wanting quoted Michael

Yes Ive got that malady The ordinary things that one naturally does
are all so pleasant and take all the time there is that I dont want
anything particular especially now that youve been such a brick

Stop it said Michael

Right I got it in rather cleverly I was saying that it must be rather
nice to want a thing so much that youll go through a lot to get it
Most fellows arent like that

A good many fellows are jellyfish observed Michael

I suppose so Im one you know I drift and float But I dont think I
sting What are you doing tonight by the way

Playing the piano I hope Why

Only that two fellows are dining with me and I thought perhaps you
would come Aunt Barbara sent me the ticket for a box at the Gaiety
too and we might look in there Then theres a dance somewhere

Thanks very much but I think I wont said Michael Im rather
looking forward to an evening alone

And thats an odd thing to look forward to remarked Francis

Not when you want to play the piano I shall have a chop here at eight
and probably thump away till midnight

Francis looked round for his hat and stick

I must go he said I ought to have gone long ago but I didnt want
to The malady came in again Most of the world have got it you know
Michael

Michael rose and stood by his tall cousin

I think we English have got it he said At least the English you
and I know have got it But I dont believe the Germans for instance
have Theyre in deadly earnest about all sorts of thingsmusic among
them which is the point that concerns me The music of the world is
German you know

Francis demurred to this

Oh I dont think so he said This thing at the Gaiety is ripping I
believe Do come and see


Michael resisted this chance of revising his opinion about the German
origin of music and Francis drifted out into Piccadilly It was already
getting on for seven oclock and the roadway and pavements were full of
people who seemed rather to contradict Michaels theory that the nation
generally suffered from the malady of not wanting so eagerly and
numerously were they on the quest for amusement Already the street was
a mass of taxicabs and private motors containing each one of them men
and women in evening dress hurrying out to dine before the theatre
or the opera Bright eager faces peered out with sheen of silk and
glitter of gems they all seemed alert and prosperous and keen for the
daily hours of evening entertainment A crowd similar in spirit pervaded
the pavements whiteshirted men with coat on arm stepped in and out
of swinging club doors and the example set by the leisured class seemed
copiously copied by those whom desks and shops had made prisoners
all day The air of the whole town swarming with the nation that is
supposed to make so grave an affair of its amusements was indescribably
gay and lighthearted the whole city seemed set on enjoying itself
The buses that boomed along were packed inside and out and each
was placarded with advertisement of some popular piece at theatre or
musichall Inside the Green Park the grass was populous with lounging
figures who unable to pay for indoor entertainment were making the
most of what the coolness of sunset and grass supplied them with gratis
the newsboards of itinerant sellers contained nothing of more serious
import than the result of cricket matches and as the dusk began to
fall street lamps and signs were lit like early rising stars so that
no hint of the gathering night should be permitted to intrude on the
perpetually illuminated city All that was sordid and sad all that was
busy except on these gay errands of pleasure was shuffled away out of
sight so that the pleasure seekers might be excused for believing that
there was nothing in the world that could demand their attention except
the need of amusing themselves successfully The workers toiled in order
that when the working day was over the fruits of their labour might
yield a harvest of a few hours enjoyment silkworms had spun so that
from carriage windows might glimmer the wrappings made from their
cocoons divers had been imperilled in deep seas so that the pearls they
had won might embellish the necks of these fair wearers

To Francis this all seemed very natural and proper part of the
recognised order of things that made up the series of sensations known
to him as life He did not as he had said very particularly care
about anything and it was undoubtedly true that there was no motive
or conscious purpose in his life for which he would voluntarily have
undergone any important stress of discomfort or annoyance It was true
that in pursuance of his profession there was a certain amount of quick
marching and drill to be done in the heat but that was incidental to
the fact that he was in the Guards and more than compensated for by the
pleasures that were also naturally incidental to it He would have been
quite unable to think of anything that he would sooner do than what
he did and he had sufficient of the ingrained human tendency to do
something of the sort which was a matter of routine rather than effort
than have nothing whatever except the gratification of momentary
whims to fill his day Besides it was one of the conventions or even
conditions of life that every boy on leaving school did something for
a certain number of years Some went into business in order to acquire
the wealth that should procure them leisure some like himself became
soldiers or sailors not because they liked guns and ships but because
to boys of a certain class these professions supplied honourable
employment and a pleasant time Without being in any way slack in his
regimental duties he performed them as many others did without the
smallest grain of passion and without any imaginative forecast as to
what fruit if any there might be to these hours spent in drill and
discipline He was but one of a very large number who do their work
without seriously bothering their heads about its possible meaning or
application His particular job gave a young man a pleasant position
and an easy path to general popularity given that he was willing to be
sociable and amused He was extremely ready to be both the one and the
other and there his philosophy of life stopped

And indeed it seemed on this hot July evening that the streets were
populated by philosophers like unto himself Never had England generally
been more prosperous more secure more comfortable The heavens of
international politics were as serene as the evening sky not yet was
the stormcloud that hung over Ireland bigger than a mans hand east
west north and south there brooded the peace of the close of a halcyon
day and the amazing doings of the Suffragettes but added a slight
incentive to the perusal of the morning paper The arts flourished
harvests prospered the world like a newlywound clock seemed to be in
for a spell of serene and orderly ticking with an occasional chime just
to show how the hours were passing

London was an extraordinarily pleasant place people were friendly
amusements beckoned on all sides and for Francis as for so many
others but a very moderate amount of work was necessary to win him
an approved place in the scheme of things a seat in the slowwheeling
sunshine It really was not necessary to want above all to undergo
annoyances for the sake of what you wanted since so many pleasurable
distractions enough to fill day and night twice over were so richly
spread around

Some day he supposed he would marry settle down and become in time one
of those men who presented a bald head in a club window to the gaze
of passersby It was difficult perhaps to see how you could enjoy
yourself or lead a life that paid its own way in pleasure at the age of
forty but that he trusted that he would learn in time At present it
was sufficient to know that in half an hour two excellent friends would
come to dinner and that they would proceed in a spirit of amiable
content to the Gaiety After that there was a ball somewhere he had
forgotten where but one of the others would be sure to know and
tomorrow and tomorrow would be like unto today It was idle to
ask questions of oneself when all went so well the time for asking
questions was when there was matter for complaint and with him
assuredly there was none The advantages of being twentythree years
old gay and goodlooking without a care in the world now that he had
Michaels cheque in his pocket needed no comment still less complaint
He like the crowd who had sufficient to pay for a sixpenny seat at a
musichall was perfectly content with life in general tomorrow
would be time enough to do a little more work and glean a little more
pleasure

It was indeed an admirable England where it was not necessary even
to desire for there were so many things bright cheerful things to
distract the mind from desire It was a day of dozing in the sun like
the submerged scattered units or duets on the grass of the Green Park
of behaving like the lilies of the field    Francis found he was
rather late and proceeded hastily to his mothers house in Savile
Row to array himself if not like one of these like an exceedingly
welldressed young man who demanded of his tailor the utmost of his
art with the prospect owing to Michaels generosity of being paid
tomorrow


Michael when his cousin had left him did not at once proceed to his
evening by himself with his piano though an hour before he had longed
to be alone with it and a pianoforte arrangement of the Meistersingers
of which he had promised himself a complete perusal that evening
But Franciss visit had already distracted him and he found now
that Franciss departure took him even farther away from his designed
evening Francis with his good looks and his gay spirits his easy
friendships and perfect content except when a small matter of deficit
and dunning letters obscured the sunlight for a moment was exactly all
that he would have wished to be himself But the moment he formulated
that wish in his mind he knew that he would not voluntarily have parted
with one atom of his own individuality in order to be Francis or anybody
else He was aware how easy and pleasant life would become if he could
look on it with Franciss eyes and if the world would look on him as it
looked on his cousin There would be no more bother    In a
moment he would by this exchange have parted with his own unhappy
temperament his own deplorable body and have stepped into an amiable
and prosperous little neutral kingdom that had no desires and no
regrets He would have been free from all wants except such as could
be gratified so easily by a little work and a great capacity for being
amused he would have found himself excellently fitting the niche into
which the rulers of birth and death had placed him an eldest son of
a great territorial magnate who had what was called a stake in the
country and desired nothing better

Willingly as he had said would he have changed circumstances with
Francis but he knew that he would not for any bait the world could
draw in front of him have changed natures with him even when to
all appearance the gain would so vastly have been on his side It was
better to want and to miss than to be content Even at this moment
when Francis had taken the sunshine out of the room with his departure
Michael clung to his own gloom and his own uncouthness if by getting
rid of them he would also have been obliged to get rid of his own
temperament unhappy as it was but yet capable of strong desire He did
not want to be content he wanted to see always ahead of him a golden
mist through which the shadows of unconjecturable shapes appeared He
was willing and eager to get lost if only he might go wandering on
groping with his big hands stumbling with his clumsy feet
desiring   

There are the indications of a path visible to all who desire Michael
knew that his path the way that seemed to lead in the direction of
the ultimate goal was music There somehow in that direction lay his
destiny that was the route He was not like the majority of his sex
and years who weave their physical and mental dreams in the loom of a
girls face in her glance in the curves of her mouth Deliberately
owing chiefly to his morbid consciousness of his own physical defects
he had long been accustomed to check the instincts natural to a young
man in this regard He had seen too often the facility with which
others more fortunate than he get delightedly lost in that golden
haze he had experienced too often the absence of attractiveness in
himself How could any girl of the London ballroom he had so frequently
asked himself tolerate dancing or sitting out with him when there was
Francis and a hundred others like him so pleased to take his place
Nor so he told himself was his mind one whit more apt than his body
It did not move lightly and agreeably with unconscious smiles and easy
laughter By nature he was monkish he was celibate He could but cease
to burn incense at such ineffectual altars and help as he had helped
this afternoon to replenish the censers of more fortunate acolytes

This was all familiar to him it passed through his head unbidden
when Francis had left him like the refrain of some wellknown song
occurring spontaneously without need of an effort of memory It was
a possession of his known by heart and it no longer except for
momentary twinges had any bitterness for him This afternoon it is
true there had been one such when Francis gleeful with his cheque
had gone out to his dinner and his theatre and his dance inviting him
cheerfully to all of them In just that had been the bitternessnamely
that Francis had so overflowing a wellspring of content that he
could be cordial in bidding him cast a certain gloom over these
entertainments Michael knew quite unerringly that Francis and his
friends would not enjoy themselves quite so much if he was with them
there would be the restraint of polite conversation at dinner instead of
completely idle babble there would be less outspoken normality at the
Gaiety a little more decorum about the whole of the boyish proceedings
He knew all that so well so terribly well   

His servant had come in with the evening paper and the implied
suggestion of the propriety of going to dress before he roused himself
He decided not to dress as he was going to spend the evening alone
and instead he seated himself at the piano with his copy of the
Meistersingers and mechanically at first with the ragged cloudfleeces
of his reverie hanging about his brain banged away at the overture
He had extraordinary dexterity of finger for one who had had so little
training and his hands with their great stretch made light work of
octaves and even tenths His knowledge of the music enabled him to wake
the singing bird of memory in his head and before long flute and horn
and string and woodwind began to make themselves heard in his inner ear
Twice his servant came in to tell him that his dinner was ready but
Michael had no heed for anything but the sounds which his flying fingers
suggested to him Francis his father his own failure in the life
that had been thrust on him were all gone he was with the singers of
Nuremberg


CHAPTER II


The River Ashe after a drowsy and meandering childhood passed
peacefully among the sedges and marigolds of its water meadows suddenly
and somewhat disconcertingly grows up and without any period of
transition and adolescence becomes from being a mere girl of a
rivulet a male and fullblooded estuary of the sea At Coton for
instance the tips of the sculls of a sauntering pleasureboat will
almost span its entire width while but a mile farther down you will
see stoneladen barges and tall redwinged sailing craft coming up with
the tide and making fast to the grey wooden quay wall of Ashbridge
rough with barnacles For the reeds and meadowsweet of its margin are
exchanged the brown and green growths of the sea with their sharp
acrid odour instead of the damp fresh smell of meadow flowers and at
low tide the podded bladders of brown weed and long strings of marine
macaroni among which peevish crabs scuttle sideways take the place
of the grass and spires of loosestrife and over the water instead of
singing larks hang white companies of chiding seagulls Here at high
tide extends a sheet of water large enough when the wind blows up the
estuary to breed waves that break in foam and spray against the barges
while at the ebb acres of mud flats are disclosed on which the boats
lean slanting till the flood lifts them again and makes them strain at
the wheezing ropes that tie them to the quay

A year before the flame of war went roaring through Europe in
unquenchable conflagration it would have seemed that nothing could
possibly rouse Ashbridge from its redbrick Georgian repose There was
never a town so inimitably drowsy or so sternly uncompetitive A hundred
years ago it must have presented almost precisely the same appearance as
it did in the summer of 1913 if we leave out of reckoning a few
dozen of modern upstart villas that line its outskirts and the very
inconspicuous railway station that hides itself behind the warehouses
near the rivers bank Most of the trains too quite ignore its
existence and pass through it on their way to more rewarding
stoppingplaces hardly recognising it even by a spurt of steam from
their whistles and it is only if you travel by those that require
the most frequent pauses in their progress that you will be enabled to
alight at its thin and depopulated platform

Just outside the station there perennially waits a lowroofed and
sanguine omnibus that under daily discouragement continues to hope that
in the longdelayed fulness of time somebody will want to be driven
somewhere This nobody ever does since the distance to any house is so
small and a porter follows with luggage on a barrow It carries on its
floor a quantity of fresh straw in the manner of the stage coaches in
which the problematic passenger should he ever appear will no doubt
bury his feet On its side just below the window that is not made to
open it carries the legend that shows that it belongs to the Comber
Arms a hostelry so selfeffacing that it is discoverable only by the
sharpesteyed of pilgrims Narrow roadways flanked by proportionately
narrower pavements lie ribbonlike between huddled shops and
squarelyspacious Georgian houses and an air of leisure and content
amounting almost to stupefaction is the moral atmosphere of the place

On the outskirts of the town crowning the gentle hills that lie to the
north and west villas in acre plots belonging to business men in the
county town some ten miles distant prick their Cockney ears and are
strangely at variance with the sober gravity of the indigenous houses
So too are the manners and customs of their owners who go to
Stoneborough every morning to their work and return by the train that
brings them home in time for dinner They do other exotic and unsuitable
things also like driving swiftly about in motors in playing golf on
the other side of the river at Coton and in having parties at each
others houses But apart from them nobody ever seems to leave Ashbridge
though a stroll to the station about the time that the evening train
arrives is a recognised diversion or in consequence ever to come
back Ashbridge in fact is selfcontained and desires neither to
meddle with others nor to be meddled with

The estuary opposite the town is some quarter of a mile broad at high
tide and in order to cross to the other side where lie the woods and
park of Ashbridge House it is necessary to shout and make staccato
prancings in order to attract the attention of the antique ferryman who
is invariably at the other side of the river and generally asleep at the
bottom of his boat If you are stronglunged and can prance and shout
for a long time he may eventually stagger to his feet come across
for you and row you over Otherwise you will stand but little chance of
arousing him from his slumbers and you will stop where you are unless
you choose to walk round by the bridge at Coton a mile above

Periodical attempts are made by the brisker inhabitants of Ashbridge
who do not understand its spirit to substitute for this aged and
ineffectual Charon someone who is occasionally awake but nothing ever
results from these revolutionary moves and the requests addressed to
the town council on the subject are never heard of again Old George
was ferryman there before any members of the town council were born and
he seems to have established a right to go to sleep on the other side of
the river which is now inalienable from him Besides asleep or awake
he is always perfectly sober which after all is really one of the
first requirements for a suitable ferryman Even the representations of
Lord Ashbridge himself who when in residence frequently has occasion
to use the ferry when crossing from his house to the town failed to
produce the smallest effect and he was compelled to build a boathouse
of his own on the farther bank and be paddled across by himself or
one of the servants Often he rowed himself for he used to be a fine
oarsman and it was good for the lounger on the quay to see the foaming
prow of his vigorous progress and the dignity of physical toil

In all other respects except in this case of Old George Lord
Ashbridges wishes were law to the local authorities for in this
tranquil Eastcoast district the spirit of the feudal system with
a beneficent lord and contented tenants strongly survived It had
triumphed even over such modern innovations as railroads for Lord
Ashbridge had the undoubted right to stop any train he pleased by signal
at Ashbridge station This he certainly enjoyed doing it fed his sense
of the fitness of things to progress along the platform with his genial
important tiptoe walk and elbows squarely stuck out to the carriage
that was at once reserved for him to touch the brim of his grey tophat
if travelling up to town to the obsequious guard and to observe the
heads of passengers who wondered why their express was arrested thrust
out of carriage windows to look at him A livened footman as well as a
valet followed him bearing a coat and a rug and a morning or evening
paper and a dispatchbox with a large gilt coronet on it and bestowed
these solaces to a railway journey on the empty seats near him And
not only his sense of fitness was hereby fed but that also of the
stationmaster and the solitary porter and the newsboy and such
inhabitants of Ashbridge as happened to have strolled on to the
platform For he was THEIR Earl of Ashbridge kind courteous and
dominant a local king it was all very pleasant

But this arrest of express trains was a strictly personal privilege
when Lady Ashbridge or Michael travelled they always went in the slow
train to Stoneborough changed there and abided their time on the
platform like ordinary mortals Though he could undoubtedly have
extended his rights to the stopping of a train for his wife or son he
wisely reserved this for himself lest it should lose prestige There
was sufficient glory already to probe his mind to the bottom for Lady
Ashbridge in being his wife it was sufficient also for Michael that he
was his son

It may be inferred that there was a touch of pomposity about this
admirable gentleman who was so excellent a landlord and so hard working
a member of the British aristocracy But pomposity would be far too
superficial a word to apply to him it would not adequately connote
his deepabiding and essential conviction that on one of the days of
Creation that probably on which the decree was made that there should
be Light there leaped into being the great landowners of England

But Lord Ashbridge though himself a peer by no means accepted the
peerage en bloc as representing the English aristocracy to be in
his phrase one of us implied that you belonged to certain
wellascertained families where brewers and distinguished soldiers
had no place unless it was theirs already He was ready to pay all
reasonable homage to those who were distinguished by their abilities
their riches their exalted positions in Church and State but his
homage to such was transfused with a courteous condescension and he
only treated as his equals and really revered those who belonged to the
families that were one of us

His wife of course was one of us since he would never have
permitted himself to be allied to a woman who was not though for beauty
and wisdom she might have been Aphrodite and Athene rolled compactly
into one peerless identity As a matter of fact Lady Ashbridge had
not the faintest resemblance to either of these effulgent goddesses In
person she resembled a camel long and lean with a drooping mouth and
tired patient eyes while in mind she was stunned No idea other than
an obvious one ever had birth behind her high smooth forehead and she
habitually brought conversation to a close by the dry enunciation of
something indubitably true which had no direct relation to the point
under discussion But she had faint ineradicable prejudices and
instincts not quite dormant There was a large quantity of mild
affection in her nature the quality of which may be illustrated by
the fact that when her father died she cried a little every day after
breakfast for about six weeks Then she did not cry any more It was
impossible not to like what there was of her but there was really very
little to like for she belonged heart and soul to the generation and
the breeding among which it is enough for a woman to be a lady and
visit the keepers wife when she has a baby

But though there was so little of her the balance was made up for
by the fact that there was so much of her husband His large rather
flamboyant person his big white face and curling brown beard his loud
voice and his falsetto laugh his absolutely certain opinions above all
the fervency of his consciousness of being Lord Ashbridge and all which
that implied completely filled any place he happened to be in so
that a room empty except for him gave the impression of being almost
uncomfortably crowded This keen consciousness of his identity was
naturally sufficient to make him very good humoured since he was
himself a fine example of the type that he admired most Probably only
two persons in the world had the power of causing him annoyance but
both of these by an irony of fate that it seemed scarcely possible to
consider accidental were closely connected with him for one was his
sister the other his only son

The grounds of their potentiality in this respect can be easily
stated Barbara Comber his sister and so one of us had married an
extremely wealthy American who in Lord Ashbridges view could not be
considered one of anybody at all in other words his imagination failed
to picture a whole class of people who resembled Anthony Jerome He had
hoped when his sister announced her intention of taking this deplorable
step that his future brotherinlaw would at any rate prove to be a
snobhe had a vague notion that all Americans were snobsand that thus
Mr Jerome would have the saving grace to admire and toady him But Mr
Jerome showed no signs of doing anything of the sort he treated him
with an austere and distant politeness that Lord Ashbridge could
not construe as being founded on admiration and a sense of his own
inferiority for it was so clearly founded on dislike That however
did not annoy Lord Ashbridge for it was easy to suppose that poor Mr
Jerome knew no better But Barbara annoyed him for not only had she
shown herself a renegade in marrying a man who was not one of us but
with all the advantages she had enjoyed since birth of knowing what
we were she gloried in her new relations saying without any proper
reticence about the matter that they were Real People whose character
and wits vastly transcended anything that Combers had to show

Michael was an even more vexatious case and in moments of depression
his father thought that he would really turn in his grave at the dismal
idea of Michael having stepped into his honourable shoes Physically he
was utterly unlike a Comber and his mind his general attitude
towards life seemed to have diverged even farther from that healthy and
unreflective pattern Only this morning his father had received a letter
from him that summed Michael up that fulfilled all the doubts and fears
that had hung about him for after three years in the Guards he had
without consultation with anybody resigned his commission on the
inexplicable grounds that he wanted to do something with his life To
begin with that was rankly heretical if you were a Comber there was no
need to do anything with your life life did everything for you   
And what this unComberish young man wanted to do with his life was to
be a musician That musicians artists actors had a right to exist
Lord Ashbridge did not question They were no doubt or might be
very excellent people in their way and as a matter of fact he often
recognised their existence by going to the opera to the private view
of the Academy or to the play and he took a very considerable pride of
proprietorship in his own admirable collection of family portraits But
then those were pictures of Combers Reynolds and Romney and the rest of
them had enjoyed the privilege of perpetuating on their canvases these
big fine men and charming women But that a Comberand that one
positively the next Lord Ashbridgeshould intend to devote his energies
to an artistic calling and allude to that scheme as doing something
with his life was a thing as unthinkable as if the butler had developed
a fixed idea that he was one of us

The blow was a recent one Michaels letter had only reached his father
this morning and at the present moment Lord Ashbridge was attempting
over a cup of tea on the long south terrace overlooking the estuary to
conveynot very successfullyto his wife something of his feelings
on the subject She according to her custom was drinking a little hot
water herself and providing her Chinese pug with a mixture of cream
and crumbled rusks Though the dog was of undoubtedly high lineage Lord
Ashbridge rather detested her

A musical career he exclaimed referring to Michaels letter What
sort of a career for a Comber is a musical career I shall tell Michael
pretty roundly when he arrives this evening what I think of it all We
shall have Francis next saying that he wants to resign too and become
a dentist

Lady Ashbridge considered this for a moment in her stunned mind

Dear me Robert I hope not she said I do not think it the least
likely that Francis would do anything of the kind Look Petsy is
better she has drunk her cream and rusks quite up I think it was only
the heat

He gave a little goodhumoured giggle of falsetto laughter

I wish Marion he said that you could manage to take your mind off
your dog for a moment and attend to me And I must really ask you not to
give your Petsy any more cream or she will certainly be sick

Lady Ashbridge gave a little sigh

All gone Petsy she said

I am glad it has all gone said he and we will hope it wont return
But about Michael now

Lady Ashbridge pulled herself together

Yes poor Michael she said He is coming tonight is he not But
just now you were speaking of Francis and the fear of his wanting to be
a dentist

Well I am now speaking of Michaels wanting to be a musician Of
course that is utterly out of the question If as he says he has sent
in his resignation he will just have to beg them to cancel it Michael
seems not to have the slightest idea of the duties which his birth and
position entail on him Unfitted for the life he now leads    waste
of time    Instead he proposes to go to Baireuth in August and then
to settle down in London to study

Lady Ashbridge recollected the almanac

That will be in September then she said I do not think I was ever
in London in September I did not know that anybody was

The point my dear is not how or where you have been accustomed to
spend your Septembers said her husband What we are talking about
is

Yes dear I know quite well what we are talking about said she We
are talking about Michael not studying music all September

Lord Ashbridge got up and began walking across the terrace opposite the
teatable with his elbows stuck out and his feet lifted rather high

Michael doesnt seem to realise that he is not Tom or Dick or Harry
said he Music indeed Im musical myself all we Combers are musical
But Michael is my only son and it really distresses me to see how
little sense he has of his responsibilities Amusements are all very
well it is not that I want to cut him off his amusements but when it
comes to a career

Lady Ashbridge was surreptitiously engaged in pouring out a little more
cream for Petsy and her husband turning rather sooner than she had
expected caught her in the act

Do not give Petsy any more cream he said with some asperity I
absolutely forbid it

Lady Ashbridge quite composedly replaced the creamjug

Poor Petsy she observed

I ask you to attend to me Marion he said

But I am attending to you very well Robert said she and I
understand you perfectly You do not want Michael to be a musician in
September and wear long hair and perhaps play at concerts I am sure
I quite agree with you for such a thing would be as unheard of in my
family as in yours But how do you propose to stop it

I shall use my authority he said stepping a little higher

Yes dear I am sure you will But what will happen if Michael doesnt
pay any attention to your authority You will be worse off than ever
Poor Michael is very obedient when he is told to do anything he intends
to do but when he doesnt agree it is difficult to do anything with
him And you see he is quite independent of you with my mother having
left him so much money Poor mamma

Lord Ashbridge felt strongly about this

It was a most extraordinary disposition of her property for your mother
to make he observed It has given Michael an independence which I
much deplore And she did it in direct opposition to my wishes

This touched on one of the questions about which Lady Ashbridge had her
convictions She had a mild but unalterable opinion that when anybody
died all that they had previously done became absolutely flawless and
laudable

Mamma did as she thought right with her property she said and it
is not for us to question it She was conscientiousness itself You will
have to excuse my listening to any criticism you may feel inclined to
make about her Robert

Certainly my dear I only want you to listen to me about Michael You
agree with me on the impossibility of his adopting a musical career I
cannot at present think so ill of Michael as to suppose that he will
defy our joint authority

Michael has a great will of his own she remarked He gets that from
you Robert though he gets his money from his grandmother

The futility of further discussion with his wife began to dawn on Lord
Ashbridge as it dawned on everybody who had the privilege of conversing
with her Her mind was a blind alley that led nowhere it was clear that
she had no idea to contribute to the subject except slightly pessimistic
forebodings with which unfortunately he found himself secretly
disposed to agree He had always felt that Michael was an uncomfortable
sort of boy in other words that he had the inconvenient habit of
thinking things out for himself instead of blindly accepting the
conclusions of other people

Much as Lord Ashbridge valued the sturdy independence of character which
he himself enjoyed displaying he appreciated it rather less highly when
it was manifested by people who were not sensible enough to agree
with him He looked forward to Michaels arrival that evening with the
feeling that there was a rebellious standard hoisted against the calm
blue of the evening sky and remembering the advent of his sister he
wondered whether she would not join the insurgent Barbara Jerome as
has been remarked often annoyed her brother she also genially laughed
at him but Lord Ashbridge partly from affection partly from a
loyal family sense of clanship always expected his sister to spend
a fortnight with him in August and would have been much hurt had she
refused to do so Her husband however so far from spending a fortnight
with his brotherinlaw never spent a minute in his presence if it
could possibly be avoided an arrangement which everybody concerned
considered to be wise and in the interests of cordiality

And Barbara comes this evening as well as Michael does she not he
said I hope she will not take Michaels part in his absurd scheme

I have given Barbara the blue room said Lady Ashbridge after a
little thought I am afraid she may bring her great dog with her I
hope he will not quarrel with Petsy Petsy does not like other dogs


The day had been very hot and Lord Ashbridge not having taken any
exercise went off to have a round of golf with the professional of the
links that lay not half a mile from the house He considered exercise
an essential part of the true Englishmans daily curriculum and as
necessary a contribution to the traditional mode of life which made them
all what they wereor should beas a bath in the morning or attendance
at church on Sunday He did not care so much about playing golf with
a casual friend because the casual friend as a rule casually beat
himthus putting him in an unEnglish positionand preferred a game
with this firstclass professional whose duty it wasin complete
violation of his capacitiesto play just badly enough to be beaten
towards the end of the round after an exciting match It required a
good deal of cleverness and selfcontrol to accomplish this for Lord
Ashbridge was a notably puerile performer but he generally managed it
with tact and success by dint of missing absurdly easy putts and here
his skill came in by pulling and slicing his ball into fardistant
bunkers Throughout the game it was his business to keep up a running
fire of admiring ejaculations such as Well driven my lord or A
fine putt my lord Ah dear me I wish I could putt like that though
occasionally his chorus of praise betrayed him into error and from
habit he found himself saying Good shot my lord when my lord had
just made an egregious mess of things But on the whole he devised so
pleasantly sycophantic an atmosphere as to procure a substantial tip for
himself and to make Lord Ashbridge conscious of being a very superior
performer Whether at the bottom of his heart he knew he could not play
at all he probably did not inquire the result of his matches and his
opponents skilfullyshowered praise was sufficient for him So now he
left the discouraging companionship of his wife and Petsy and walked
swingingly across the garden and the park to the links there to seek
in Macphersons applause the selfconfidence that would enable him to
encounter his republican sister and his musical son with an unyielding
front

His spirits mounted rapidly as he went It pleased him to go jauntily
across the lawn and reflect that all this smooth turf was his to look
at the wealth of welltended flowers in his garden and know that all
this polychromatic loveliness was bred in Lord Ashbridges borders and
was graciously thrown open to the gaze of the admiring public on Sunday
afternoon when they were begged to keep off the grass and that Lord
Ashbridge was himself He liked reminding himself that the towering elms
drew their leafy verdure from Lord Ashbridges soil that the rows of
hencoops in the park populous and cheeping with infant pheasants
belonged to the same fortunate gentleman who in November would so
unerringly shoot them down as they rocketted swiftly over the highest
of his treetops that to him also appertained the longfronted Jacobean
house which stood so commandingly upon the hilltop and glowed with
all the mellowness of its threehundredyearsold bricks And his
satisfaction was not wholly fatuous nor entirely personal all these
spacious dignities were insignia temporarily conferred on him like
some order and permanently conferred on his family of the splendid
political constitution under which England had made herself mistress
of an empire and the seas that guarded it Probably he would have been
proud of belonging to that even if he had not been one of us as it
was the high position which he occupied in it caused that pride to be
slightly mixed with the pride that was concerned with the notion of the
Empire belonging to him and his peers

But though he was the most profound of Tories he would truthfully have
professed as indeed he practised in the management of his estates the
most Liberal opinions as to schemes for the amelioration of the lower
classes Only just as the music he was good enough to listen to had to
be played for him so the tenants and farmers had to be his dependents
He looked after them very well indeed conceiving this to be the
prime duty of a great landlord but his interest in them was really
proprietary It was of his bounty and of his complete knowledge of
what his duties as one of us were that he did so and any legislation
which compelled him to part with one pennyworth of his property for the
sake of others less fortunate he resisted to the best of his ability as
a theft of what was his The country in fact if it went to the dogs
and certain recent legislation distinctly seemed to point kennelwards
would go to the dogs because ignorant politicians who were most
emphatically not of us forced him and others like him to recognise
the rights of dependents instead of trusting to their instinctive
fitness to dispense benefits not as rights but as acts of grace If
England trusted to her aristocracy to put the matter in a nutshell all
would be well with her in the future even as it had been in the past
but any attempt to curtail their splendours must inevitably detract
from the prestige and magnificence of the Empire    And he responded
suitably to the obsequious salute of the professional and remembered
that the entire golf links were his property and that the Club paid a
merely nominal rental to him just the tribute money of a penny which
was due to Caesar


For the next hour or two after her husband had left her Lady Ashbridge
occupied herself in the thoroughly ladylike pursuit of doing nothing
whatever she just existed in her comfortable chair since Barbara
might come any moment and she would have to entertain her which she
frequently did unawares But as Barbara continued not to come she took
up her perennial piece of needlework feeling rather busy and pressed
and had hardly done so when her sisterinlaw arrived

She was preceded by an enormous staghound who having been shut up in
her motor all the way from London bounded delightedly with the sense
of young limbs released on to the terrace and made wild leaps in
a circle round the horrified Petsy who had just received a second
saucerful of cream Once he dashed in close and with a single lick of
his tongue swept the saucer dry of nutriment and with hoarse barkings
proceeded again to dance corybantically about while Lady Ashbridge
with faint cries of dismay waved her embroidery at him Then seeing
his mistress coming out of the French window from the drawingroom he
bounded calflike towards her and Petsy nearly sick with cream and
horror was gathered to Lady Ashbridges bosom

My dear Barbara she said how upsetting your dog is Poor Petsys
heart is beating terribly she does not like dogs But I am very pleased
to see you and I have given you the blue room

It was clearly suitable that Barbara Jerome should have a large dog
for both in mind and body she was on the large scale herself She had a
pleasant highcoloured face was very tall enormously stout and moved
with great briskness and vigour She had something to say on any subject
that came on the board and what was less usual in these days of
universal knowledge there was invariably some point in what she said
She had in the ordinary sense of the word no manners at all
but essentially made up for this lack by her sincere and humourous
kindliness She saw with acute vividness the ludicrous side of
everybody herself included and to her mind the archhumourist of
all was her brother whom she was quite unable to take seriously She
dressed as if she had looted a milliners shop and had put on in a great
hurry anything that came to hand She towered over her sisterinlaw as
she kissed her and Petsy safe in her citadel barked shrilly

My dear which is the blue room she said I hope it is big enough
for Og and me Yes that is Og which is short for dog He takes two
muttonchops for dinner and a little something during the night if he
feels disposed because he is still growing Tony drove down with me
and is in the car now He would not come in for fear of seeing Robert
so I ventured to tell them to take him a cup of tea there which he will
drink with the blinds down and then drive back to town again He has
been made American ambassador by the way and will go in to dinner
before Robert My dear I can think of few things which Robert is less
fitted to bear than that However we all have our crosses even those
of us who have our coronets also

Lady Ashbridges hospitable instincts asserted themselves But your
husband must come in she said I will go and tell him And Robert has
gone to play golf

Barbara laughed

I am quite sure Tony wont come in she said I promised him he
shouldnt and he only drove down with me on the express stipulation
that no risks were to be run about his seeing Robert We must take no
chances so let him have his tea quietly in the motor and then drive
away again And who else is there Anybody Michael

Michael comes this evening

I am glad I am particularly fond of Michael Also he will play to us
after dinner and though I dont know one note from another it will
relieve me of sitting in a stately circle watching Robert cheat at
patience I always find the evenings here rather trying they remind me
of being in church I feel as if I were part of a corporate body which
leads to misplaced decorum Ah there is the sound of Tonys retreating
motor his strategic movement has come off And now give me some news
if you can get in a word Dear me there is Robert coming back across
the lawn What a mercy that Tony did not leave the motor Robert always
walks as if he was dancing a minuet Look there is Og imitating him Or
is he stalking him thinking he is an enemy Og come here

She whistled shrilly on her fingers and rose to greet her brother whom
Og was still menacing as he advanced towards her with staccato steps
Barbara however got between Og and his prey and threw her parasol at
him

My dear how are you she said And how did the golf go And did you
beat the professional

He suspected flippancy here and became markedly dignified

An excellent match he said and Macpherson tells me I played a very
sound game I am delighted to see you Barbara And did Michael come
down with you

No I drove from town It saves time but not expense with your awful
trains

And you are well and Mr Jerome he asked He always called his
brotherinlaw Mr Jerome to indicate the gulf between them Barbara
gave a little spurt of laughter

Yes his excellency is quite well she said You must call him
excellency now my dear

Indeed That is a great step

Considering that Tony began as an officeboy How richly rewarding you
are my dear And shant I make an odd ambassadress I havent been to a
Court since the dark ages when I went to those beloved States We will
practise after dinner dear and you and Marion shall be the King and
Queen and I will try to walk backwards without tumbling on my head You
will like being the King Robert And then we will be ourselves again
all except Og who shall be Tony and shall go out of the room before
you

He gave his treble little giggle for on the whole it answered better
not to be dignified with Barbara whenever he could remember not to
be and Lady Ashbridge still nursing Petsy threw a bombshell of the
obvious to explode the conversation

Og has two muttonchops for his dinner she said and he is growing
still Fancy

Lord Ashbridge took a refreshing glance at the broad stretch of country
that all belonged to him

I am rather glad to have this opportunity of talking to you my dear
Barbara he said before Michael comes

His train gets in half an hour before dinner said Lady Ashbridge He
has to change at Stoneborough

Quite so I heard from Michael this morning saying that he has
resigned his commission in the Guards and is going to take up music
seriously

Barbara gave a delighted exclamation

But how perfectly splendid she said Fancy a Comber doing anything
original Michael and I are the only Combers who ever have since
Combers arose from out the azure main in the year one I married an
American thats something though its not up to Michael

That is not quite my view of it said he As for its being original
it would be original enough if Marion eloped with a Patagonian

Lady Ashbridge let fall her embroidery at this monstrous suggestion

You are talking very wildly Robert she said in a pained voice

My dear get on with your sacred carpet said he I am talking to
Barbara I have already ascertained youryour lack of views on the
subject I was saying Barbara that mere originality is not a merit

No you never said that remarked Lady Ashbridge

I should have if you had allowed me to And as for your saying that he
has done it Barbara that is very wide of the mark and I intend shall
continue to be so

Dear great Bashaw that is just what you said to me when I told you
I was going to marry his Excellency But I did And I think it is a
glorious move on Michaels part It requires brain to find out what you
like and character to go and do it Combers havent got brains as
a rule you see If they ever had any they have degenerated into
conservative instincts

He again refreshed himself with the landscape The roofs of Ashbridge
were visible in the clear sunset    Ashbridge paid its rents with
remarkable regularity

That may or may not be so he said forgetting for a moment the danger
of being dignified But Combers have position

Barbara controlled herself admirably A slight tremor shook her which
he did not notice

Yes dear she said I allow that Combers have had for many
generations a sort of acquisitive cunning for all we possess has
come to us by exceedingly prudent marriages They have alsoI am an
exception herethe gift of not saying very much which certainly has an
impressive effect even when it arises from not having very much to say
They are sticky they attract wealth and they have the force called vis
inertiae which means that they invest their money prudently You should
hear Tonywell perhaps you had better not hear Tony But now here
is Michael showing that he has got tastes Can you wonder that Im
delighted And not only has he got tastes but he has the strength of
character to back them Michael in the Guards too It was a perfect
farce and hes had the sense to see it He hated his duties and he
hated his diversions Now Francis

I am afraid Michael has always been a little jealous of Francis
remarked his father

This roused Barbara she spoke quite seriously

If you really think that my dear she said you have the distinction
of being the worst possible judge of character that the world has ever
known Michael might be jealous of anybody else for the poor boy feels
his physical awkwardness most sensitively but Francis is just the one
person he really worships He would do anything in the world for him

The discussion with Barbara was being even more fruitless than that with
his wife and Lord Ashbridge rose

All I can do then is to ask you not to back Michael up he said

My dear he wont need backing up Hes a match for you by himself But
if Michael after thoroughly worsting you asks me my opinion I shall
certainly give it him But he wont ask my opinion first He will strew
your limbs Robert over this delightful terrace

Michaels train is late said Lady Ashbridge hearing the stable clock
strike He should have been here before this

Barbara had still a word to say and disregarded this quencher

But dont think Robert she said that because Michael resists your
wishes and authority he will be enjoying himself He will hate doing
it but that will not stop him

Lord Ashbridge was not a bully he had merely a profound sense of his
own importance

We will see about resistance he said

Barbara was not so successful on this occasion and exploded loudly

You will dear indeed she said


Michael meantime had been travelling down from London without perturbing
himself over the scene with his father which he knew lay before him
This was quite characteristic of him he had a singular command over his
imagination when he had made up his mind to anything and never indulged
in the gratuitous pain of anticipation Today he had an additional
bulwark against such selfinflicted worries for he had spent his last
two hours in town at the vocal recital of a singer who a month before
had stirred the critics into rhapsody over her gift of lyric song
Up till now he had had no opportunity of hearing her and with the
panegyrics that had been showered on her in his mind he had gone with
the expectation of disappointment But now an hour afterwards the
wheels of the train sang her songs and in the inward ear he could
recapture with the vividness of an hallucination the timbre of
that wonderful voice and also the sweet harmonies of the pianist who
accompanied her

The hall had been packed from end to end and he had barely got to his
seat the only one vacant in the whole room when Miss Sylvia Falbe
appeared followed at once by her accompanist whose name occurred
nowhere on the programme Two neighbours however who chatted shrilly
during the applause that greeted them informed him that this was
Hermann dear Hermann there is no one like him But it occurred to
Michael that the singer was like him though she was fair and he dark
But his perception of either of them visually was but vague he had come
to hear and not to see Neither she nor Hermann had any music with them
and Hermann just glanced at the programme which he put down on the top
of the piano which again unusually was open Then without pause they
began the set of German songsBrahms Schubert Schumannwith which
the recital opened And for one moment before he lost himself in the
ecstasy of hearing Michael found himself registering the fact that
Sylvia Falbe had one of the most charming faces he had ever seen The
next he was swallowed up in melody

She had the ease of the consummate artist and each note like the gates
of the New Jerusalem was a pearl round and smooth and luminous almost
so that it was as if manycoloured light came from her lips Nor was
that all it seemed as if the accompaniment was made by the song itself
coming into life with the freshness of the dawn of its creation it was
impossible to believe that one mind directed the singer and another the
pianist and if the voice was an example of art in excelsis not less
exalted was the perfection of the player Not for a moment through the
song did he take his eyes off her he looked at her with an intensity of
gaze that seemed to be reading the emotion with which the lovely melody
filled her For herself she looked straight out over the hall with
grey eyes halfclosed and mouth that in the pauses of her song was
large and fulllipped generously curving and face that seemed lit with
the light of the morning she sang of She was the song Michael thought
of her as just that and the pianist who watched and understood her so
unerringly was the song too They had for him no identity of their own
they were as remote from everyday life as the mind of Schumann which
they made so vivid It was then that they existed

The last song of the group she sang in English for it was Who is
Sylvia There was a buzz of smiles and whispers among the front row in
the pause before it and regaining her own identity for a moment she
smiled at a group of her friends among whom clearly it was a cliche
species of joke that she should ask who Sylvia was and enumerate her
merits when all the time she was Sylvia Michael felt rather impatient
at this she was not anybody just now but a singer And then came the
divine inevitable simplicity of perfect words and the melody preordained
for them The singer as he knew was German but she had no trace of
foreign accent It seemed to him that this was just one miracle the
more she had become English because she was singing what Shakespeare
wrote

The next group consisting of modern French songs appeared to Michael
utterly unworthy of the singer and the echoing piano If you had it in
you to give reality to great and simple things it was surely a waste
to concern yourself with these little morbid melancholy manikins these
marionettes But his emotions being unoccupied he attended more to the
manner of the performance and in especial to the marvellous technique
not so much of the singer but of the pianist who caused the rain to
fall and the waters reflect the toneless grey skies He had never even
when listening to the great masters heard so flawless a comprehension
as this anonymous player incidentally known as Hermann exhibited As
far as mere manipulation went it was as might perhaps be expected
entirely effortless but effortless no less was the understanding of the
music It happened    It was like that

All of this so filled Michaels mind as he travelled down that evening
to Ashbridge that he scarcely remembered the errand on which he went
and when it occurred to him it instantly sank out of sight again lost
in the recollection of the music which he had heard today and which
belonged to the art that claimed the allegiance of his soul The rattle
of the wheels was alchemised into song and as with halfclosed eyes he
listened to it there swam across it now the full face of the singer
now the profile of the pianist that had stood out white and intent
against the dark panelling behind his head He had gleaned one fact at
the boxoffice as he hurried out to catch his train this Hermann was
the singers brother a teacher of the piano in London and apparently
highly thought of


CHAPTER III


Michaels train as his mother had so infallibly pronounced was late
and he had arrived only just in time to hurry to his room and dress
quickly in order not to add to his crimes the additional one of
unpunctuality for unpunctuality so Lord Ashbridge held was the
politeness not only of kings but of all who had any pretence to decent
breeding His father gave him a carefullyiced welcome his mother
the tip of her long camellike lips and they waited solemnly for the
appearance of Aunt Barbara who it would seem had forfeited her claims
to family by her marriage A manservant and a half looked after each
of them at dinner and the twelve Lord Ashbridges in uniform looked down
from their illuminated frames on their degenerate descendant

The only bright spot in this portentous banquet was Aunt Barbara who
had chosen that evening with what intention may possibly be guessed to
put on an immense diamond tiara and a breastplate of rubies while Og
after one futile attempt to play with the footmen yielded himself up to
the chilling atmosphere of good breeding and ate his muttonchops
with great composure But Aunt Barbara fortified by her gems ate an
excellent dinner and talked all the time with occasional bursts of
unexplained laughter

Afterwards when Michael was left alone with his father he found that
his best efforts at conversation elicited only monosyllabic replies and
at last in the despairing desire to bring things to a head he asked
him if he had received his letter An affirmative monosyllable followed
by the hissing of Lord Ashbridges cigarette end as he dropped it into
his coffee cup answered him and he perceived that the approaching
storm was to be rendered duly impressive by the thundery stillness that
preceded it Then his father rose and as he passed Michael who held
the door open for him said

If you can spare the time Michael I would like to have a talk with
you when your mother and aunt have gone to bed

That was not very long delayed Michael imagined that Aunt Barbara must
have had a hint for before halfpast ten she announced with a skilfully
suppressed laugh that she was about to retire and kissed Michael
affectionately Both her laugh and her salute were encouraging he felt
that he was being backed up Then a procession of footmen came into the
room bearing lemonade and soda water and whiskey and a plate of plain
biscuits and the moment after he was alone with his father

Lord Ashbridge rose and walked very tall and majestic to the
fireplace where he stood for a moment with his back to his son Then he
turned round

Now about this nonsense of your resigning your commission Michael
he said I dont propose to argue about it and I am just going to tell
you If as you have informed me you have actually sent it in you will
write tomorrow with due apologies and ask that it may be withdrawn I
will see your letter before you send it

Michael had intended to be as quiet and respectful as possible
consistent with firmness but a sentence here gave him a spasm of anger

I dont know what you mean sir he said by saying if I have sent
it in You have received my letter in which I tell you that I have done
so

Already even at the first words there was bad blood between them
Michaels face had clouded with that gloom which his father would
certainly call sulky and for himself he resented the tone of Michaels
reply To make matters worse he gave his little falsetto cackle which
no doubt was intended to convey the impression of confident good humour
But there was it must be confessed very little good humour about
it though he still felt no serious doubt about the result of this
interview

Im afraid perhaps then that I did not take your letter quite
seriously my dear Michael he said in the bantering tone that froze
Michaels cordiality completely up I glanced through it I saw a lot
of nonsenseor so it struck meabout your resigning your commission
and studying music I think you mentioned Baireuth and settling down in
London afterwards

Yes I said all that said Michael But you make a mistake if you do
not see that it was written seriously

His father glanced across at him where he sat with his heavy plain
face his long arms and short legs and the sight merely irritated
him With his passion for convention and one of the most important
conventions was that Combers should be fine strapping normal people
he hated the thought that it was his son who presented that appearance
And his sons mind seemed to him at this moment as ungainly as his
person Again very unwisely he laughed still thinking to carry this
off by the high hand

Yes but I cant take that rubbish seriously he said I am asking
your permission now to inquire without any nonsense into what you
mean

Michael frowned He felt the insincerity of his fathers laugh and
rebelled against the unfairness of it The question he knew well was
sarcastically asked the flavour of irony in the permission to inquire
was not there by accident To speak like that implied contempt of his
opposition he felt that he was being treated like a child over some
nursery rebellion in which subsequently there is no real possibility
of disobedience He felt his anger rising in spite of himself

If you refer to it as rubbish sir there is the end of the matter

Ah I thought we should soon agree said Lord Ashbridge chuckling

You mistake me said Michael There is the end of the matter because
I wont discuss it any more if you treat me like this I will say good
night if you intend to persist in the idea that you can just brush my
resolves away like that

This clearly took his father aback it was a perfectly dignified and
proper attitude to take in the face of ridicule and Lord Ashbridge
though somewhat an adept at the art of selfdeceptionas for instance
when he habitually beat the golf professionalcould not disguise from
himself that his policy had been to laugh and blow away Michaels absurd
ideas But it was abundantly clear at this moment that this apparently
easy operation was out of his reach

He got up with more amenity in his manner than he had yet shown
and laid his hand on Michaels shoulder as he stood in front of him
evidently quite prepared to go away

Come my dear Michael This wont do he said I thought it best
to treat your absurd schemes with a certain lightness and I have only
succeeded in irritating you

Michael was perfectly aware that he had scored And as his object was to
score he made another criticism

When you say absurd schemes sir he said with quiet respect are
you not still laughing at them

Lord Ashbridge again retreated strategically

Very well I withdraw absurd he said Now sit down again and we
will talk Tell me what is in your mind

Michael made a great effort with himself He desired in the secret
real Michael to be reasonable and cordial to behave filially while
all the time his nerves were on edge with his fathers ridicule and
with his instinctive knowledge of his fathers distaste for him

Well its like this father he said Im doing no good as I am I
went into the Guards as you know because it was the right thing to do
A business mans son is put into business for the same reason And Im
not good at it

Michael paused a moment

My heart isnt in it he said and I dislike it It seems to me
useless Were for show And my heart is quite entirely in music Its
the thing I care for more than anything else

Again he paused all that came so easily to his tongue when he was
speaking to Francis was congealed now when he felt the contempt with
which though unexpressed he knew he inspired his father

Lord Ashbridge waited with careful politeness his eyes fixed on the
ceiling his large person completely filling his chair just as his
atmosphere filled the room He said nothing at all until the silence
rang in Michaels ears

That is all I can tell you he said at length

Lord Ashbridge carefully conveyed the ash from his cigarette to the
fireplace before he spoke He felt that the time had come for his most
impressive effort

Very well then listen to me he said What you suffer from
Michael is a mere want of selfconfidence and from modesty You dont
seem to graspI have often noticed thiswho you are and what your
importance isan importance which everybody is willing to recognise if
you will only assume it You have the privileges of your position which
you dont sufficiently value but you have also the responsibilities
of it which I am afraid you are inclined to shirk You havent got the
large view you havent the sense of patriotism There are a great many
things in my positionthe position into which you will stepwhich I
would much sooner be without But we have received a tradition and we
are bound to hand it on intact You may think that this has nothing
to do with your being in the Guards but it has Weand he seemed to
swell a littlewe are bound in honour to take the lead in the service
of our country and we must do it whether we like it or not We have to
till with our own efforts our goodly heritage You have to learn the
meaning of such words as patriotism and caste and duty

Lord Ashbridge thought that he was really putting this very well indeed
and he had the sustaining consciousness of sincerity He entirely
believed what he said and felt that it must carry conviction to anyone
who listened to it with anything like an open mind The only thing that
he did not allow for was that he personally immensely enjoyed his social
and dominant position thinking it indeed the only position which was
really worth having This naturally gave an aid to comprehension and
he did not take into account that Michael was not so blessed as he and
indeed lacked this very superior individual enlightenment But his own
words kindled the flame of this illumination and without noticing the
blank stolidity of Michaels face he went on with gathering confidence

I am sure you are highminded my dear Michael he said And it is to
your highmindedness that Iyes I dont mind saying itthat I appeal
In a moment of unreflectiveness you have thrown overboard what I am sure
is real to you the sense broadly speaking that you are English and of
the highest English class and have intended to devote yourself to more
selfish and pleasureloving aims and to dwell in a tinkle of pleasant
sounds that please your ear and Im sure I dont wonder because as
your mother and I both know you play charmingly But I feel confident
that your better mind does not really confuse the mere diversions of
life with its serious issues

Michael suddenly rose to his feet

Father Im afraid this is no use at all he said All that I feel
and all that I cant say I know is unintelligible to you You have
called it rubbish once and you think it is rubbish still

Lord Ashbridges eloquence was suddenly arrested He had been cantering
gleefully along and had the very distinct impression of having run up
against a stone wall He dismounted hurt but in no way broken

I am anxious to understand you Michael he said

Yes father but you dont said he You have been explaining me all
wrong For instance I dont regard music as a diversion That is the
only explanation there is of me

And as regards my wishes and my authority asked his father

Michael squared his shoulders and his mind

I am exceedingly sorry to disappoint you in the matter of your wishes
he said but in the matter of your authority I cant recognise it when
the question of my whole life is at stake I know that I am your son
and I want to be dutiful but I have my own individuality as well That
only recognises the authority of my own conscience

That seemed to Lord Ashbridge both tragic and ludicrous Completely
subservient himself to the conventions which he so much enjoyed it was
like the defiance of a child to say such things He only just checked
himself from laughing again

I refuse to take that answer from you he said

I have no other to give you said Michael But I should like to say
once more that I am sorry to disobey your wishes

The repetition took away his desire to laugh In fact he could not have
laughed

I dont want to threaten you Michael he said But you may know that
I have a very free hand in the disposal of my property

Is that a threat asked Michael

It is a hint

Then father I can only say that I should be perfectly satisfied with
anything you may do said Michael I wish you could leave everything
you have to Francis I tell you in all sincerity that I wish he had been
my elder brother You would have been far better pleased with him

Lord Ashbridges anger rose He was naturally so selfcomplacent as to
be seldom disposed to anger but its rarity was not due to kindliness of
nature

I have before now noticed your jealousy of your cousin he observed

Michaels face went white

That is infamous and untrue father he said

Lord Ashbridge turned on him

Apologise for that he said

Michael looked up at his high towering without a tremor

I wait for the withdrawal of your accusation that I am jealous of
Francis he replied

There was a dead silence Lord Ashbridge stood there in swollen and
speechless indignation and Michael faced him undismayed    And then
suddenly to the boy there came an impulse of pure pity for his fathers
disappointment in having a son like himself He saw with the candour
which was so real a part of him how hopeless it must be to a man of his
fathers mind to have a millstone like himself unalterably bound round
his neck fit to choke and drown him

Indeed I am not jealous of Francis father he said and I speak
quite truthfully when I say how I sympathise with you in having a son
like me I dont want to vex you I want to make the best of myself

Lord Ashbridge stood looking exactly like his statue in the marketplace
at Ashbridge

If that is the case Michael he said it is within your power You
will write the letter I spoke about

Michael paused a moment as if waiting for more It did not seem to him
possible that his appeal should bear no further fruit than that But it
was soon clear that there was no more to come

I will wish you good night father he said


Sunday was a day on which Lord Ashbridge was almost more himself than
during the week so shining and public an example did he become of
the British nobleman Instead of having breakfast according to the
middleclass custom rather later than usual that solid sausagy meal
was half an hour earlier so that all the servants except those whose
presence in the house was imperatively necessary for purposes of lunch
should go to church Thus Old George and Lord Ashbridges private boat
were exceedingly busy for the halfhour preceding church time the last
boatload holding the family whose arrival was the signal for service
to begin Lady Ashbridge however always went on earlier for she
presided at the organ with the long camellike back turned towards the
congregation and started playing a slow melancholy voluntary when the
boy who blew the bellows said to her in an ecclesiastical whisper His
lordship has arrived my lady Those of the household who could sing
singing being construed in the sense of making a loud and cheerful
noise in the throat clustered in the choirpews near the organ while
the family sat in a large square box with a stove in the centre amply
supplied with prayerbooks of the time when even Protestants might pray
for Queen Caroline Behind them separated from the rest of the church
by an ornamental ironwork grille was the Comber chapel in which
antiquarians took nearly as much pleasure as Lord Ashbridge himself
Here reclined a glorious company of sixteenth century knights with
their honourable ladies at their sides unyielding marble bolsters at
their heads and grotesque dogs at their feet Later when their peerage
was conferred they lost a little of their yeoman simplicity and became
peruked and robed and breeched one indeed in the age of George III
who was blessed with poetical aspirations appeared in bare feet and a
Roman toga with a scroll of manuscript in his hand while later again
mere tablets on the walls commemorated their almost uncanny virtues

And just on the other side of the grille but a step away sat the
presentday representatives of the line while Lady Ashbridge finished
the last bars of her voluntary Lord Ashbridge himself and his sister
large and smart and comely and Michael beside them short and heavy
with his soul full of the aspirations his father neither could nor cared
to understand According to his invariable custom Lord Ashbridge read
the lessons in a loud sonorous voice his large white hands grasping
the wingfeathers of the brass eagle and a great carnation in his
buttonhole and when the time came for the offertory he put a sovereign
in the open plate himself and proceeded with his minuetlike step to go
round the church and collect the gifts of the encouraged congregation
He followed all the prayers in his book he made the responses in a
voice nearly as loud as that in which he read the lessons he sang the
hymns with a curious buzzing sound and never for a moment did he lose
sight of the fact that he was the head of the Comber family doing his
duty as the custom of the Combers was and setting an example of godly
piety Afterwards as usual he would change his black coat eat a good
lunch stroll round the gardens for he had nothing to say to golf on
Sunday and in the evening the clergyman would dine with him and
would be requested to say grace both before and after the meal He knew
exactly the proper mode of passing the Sunday for the landlord on his
country estate and when Lord Ashbridge knew that a thing was proper he
did it with invariable precision

Michael of course was in disgrace his father pending some further
course of action neither spoke to him nor looked at him indeed it
seemed doubtful whether he would hand him the offertory plate and
it was perhaps a pity that he unbent even to this extent for Michael
happened to have none of the symbols of thankfulness about his person
and he saw a slight quiver pass through Aunt Barbaras hymnbook After
a rather portentous lunch however there came some relief for his
father did not ask his company on the usual Sunday afternoon stroll and
Aunt Barbara never walked at all unless she was obliged In consequence
when the thunderstorm had stepped airily away across the park Michael
joined her on the terrace with the intention of talking the situation
over with her

Aunt Barbara was perfectly willing to do this and she opened the
discussion very pleasantly with peals of laughter

My dear I delight in you she said and altogether this is the most
entertaining day I have ever spent here Combers are supposed to be very
serious solid people but for unconscious humour there isnt a family
in England or even in the States to compare with them Our lunch just
now if you could put it into a satirical comedy called The Aristocracy
it would make the fortune of any theatre

A dawning smile began to break through Michaels tragedy face

I suppose it was rather funny he said But really Im wretched about
it Aunt Barbara

My dear what is there to be wretched about You might have been
wretched if you had found you couldnt stand up to your father but I
gather though I know nothing directly that you did At least your
mother has said to me three times twice on the way to church and once
coming back Michael has vexed his father very much And the offertory
plate my dear and as I was saying lunch I am in disgrace too
because I said perfectly plainly yesterday that I was on your side and
there we were at lunch with your father apparently unable to see either
you or me and unconscious of our presence Fancy pretending not to see
me You cant help seeing me a large bright object like me And what
will happen next Thats what tickles me to death as they say on my
side of the Atlantic Will he gradually begin to perceive us again like
objects looming through a fog or shall we come into view suddenly as
if going round a corner And you are just as funny my dear with your
long face and air of depressed determination Why be heavy Michael So
many people are heavy and none of them can tell you why

It was impossible not to feel the unfreezing effect of this Michael
thawed to it as he would have thawed to Francis

Perhaps they cant help it Aunt Barbara he said At least I know I
cant I really wish I could learn how to II dont see the funny side
of things till it is pointed out I thought lunch a sort of hell you
know Of course it was funny his appearing not to see either of
us But it stands for more than that it stands for his complete
misunderstanding of me

Aunt Barbara had the sense to see that the real Michael was speaking
When people were being unreal when they were pompous or adopting
attitudes she could attend to nothing but their absurdity which
engrossed her altogether But she never laughed at real things real
things were not funny but were facts

He quite misunderstands went on Michael with the eagerness with
which the shy welcome comprehension He thinks I can make my mind
like his if I choose and if I dont choose or rather cant choose he
thinks that his wishes his authority should be sufficient to make
me act as if it was Well I wont do that He may go onand that
pleasant smile lit up Michaels plain facehe may go on being unaware
of my presence as long as he pleases I am very sorry it should be so
but I cant help it And the worst of it is that opposition of that
sorthis sortmakes me more determined than ever

Aunt Barbara nodded

And your friends she asked What will they think

Michael looked at her quite simply and directly

Friends he said I havent got any

Ah my dear thats nonsense she said

I wish it was Oh Francis is a friend I know He thinks me an odd
old thing but he likes me Other people dont And I cant see why they
should Im sure its my fault Its because Im heavy You said I was
yourself

Then I was a great ass remarked Aunt Barbara You wouldnt be heavy
with people who understood you You arent heavy with me for instance
but my dear lead isnt in it when you are with your father

But what am I to do if Im like that asked the boy

She held up her large fat hand and marked the points off on her
fingers

Three things she said Firstly get away from people who dont
understand you and whom incidentally you dont understand Secondly
try to see how ridiculous you and everybody else always are and
thirdly which is much the most important dont think about yourself
If I thought about myself I should consider how old and fat and ugly
I am Im not ugly really you neednt be foolish and tell me so I
should spoil my life by trying to be young and only eating devilled
codfish and drinking hot plumjuice or whatever is the accepted remedy
for what we call obesity Were all odd old things as you say We can
only get away from that depressing fact by doing something and not
thinking about ourselves We can all try not to be egoists Egoism is
the really heavy quality in the world

She paused a moment in this inspired discourse and whistled to Og
who had stretched his weary limbs across a bed of particularly fine
geraniums

There she said pointing if your dog had done that you would be
submerged in depression at the thought of how vexed your father would
be That would be because you are thinking of the effect on yourself As
its my dog that has done itdear me they do look squashed now he has
got upyou dont really mind about your fathers vexation because you
wont have to think about yourself That is wise of you if you were a
little wiser still you would picture to yourself how ridiculous I shall
look apologising for Og Kindly kick him Michael he will understand
Naughty And as for your not having any friends that would be
exceedingly sad if you had gone the right way to get them and failed
But you havent You havent even gone among the people who could be
your friends Your friends broadly speaking must like the same sort of
things as you There must be a common basis You cant even argue with
somebody or disagree with somebody unless you have a common ground to
start from If I say that black is white and you think it is blue we
cant get on It leads nowhere And finally

She turned round and faced him directly

Finally dont be so cross my dear she said

But am I asked he

Yes You dont know it or else probably since you are a very decent
fellow you wouldnt be You expect not to be liked and that is cross
of you A goodhumoured person expects to be liked and almost always
is You expect not to be understood and thats dreadfully cross You
think your father doesnt understand you no more he does but dont go
on thinking about it You think it is a great bore to be your fathers
only son and wish Francis was instead Thats cross you may think its
fine but it isnt and it is also ungrateful You can have great fun if
you will only be goodtempered

How did you know thatabout Francis I mean asked Michael

Does it happen to be true Of course it does Every cross young man
wishes he was somebody else

No not quite that began Michael

Dont interrupt It is sufficiently accurate And you think about
your appearance my dear It will do quite well You might have had two
noses or only one eye whereas you have two rather jolly ones And do
try to see the joke in other people Michael You didnt see the joke
in your interview last night with your father It must have been
excruciatingly funny I dont say it wasnt sad and serious as well But
it was funny too there were points

Michael shook his head

I didnt see them he said

But I should have and I should have been right All dignity is funny
simply because it is sham When dignity is real you dont know its
dignity But your father knew he was being dignified and you knew you
were being dignified My dear what a pair of you

Michael frowned

But is nothing serious then he asked Surely it was serious enough
last night There was I in rank rebellion to my father and it vexed him
horribly it did more it grieved him

She laid her hand on Michaels knee

As if I didnt know that she said Were all sorry for that though
I should have been much sorrier if you had given in and ceased to vex
him But there it is Accept that and then my dear swiftly apply
yourself to perceive the humour of it And now about your plans

I shall go to Baireuth on Wednesday and then on to Munich began
Michael

That of course Perhaps you may find the humour of a Channel crossing
I look for it in vain Yet I dont know    The man who puts on a
yachtingcap and asks if theres a bit of a sea on It proves to be the
case and he is excessively unwell I must look out for him next time I
cross And then

Then I shall settle in town and study Oh heres my father coming
home

Lord Ashbridge approached down the terrace He stopped for a moment at
the desecrated geranium bed saw the two sitting together and turned at
right angles and went into the house Almost immediately a footman
came out with a long doglead and advanced hesitatingly to Og Og was
convinced that he had come to play with him and crouched and growled
and retreated and advanced with engaging affability Out of the windows
of the library looked Lord Ashbridges baleful face    Aunt
Barbara swayed out of her chair and laid a trembling hand on Michaels
shoulder

I shall go and apologise for Og she said I shall do it quite
sincerely my dear But there are points


CHAPTER IV


Michael practised a certain mature and rather elderly precision in the
ordinary affairs of daily life His habits were almost unduly tidy and
punctual he answered letters by return of post he never mislaid things
nor tore up documents which he particularly desired should be preserved
he kept his gold in a purse and his change in a trouserspocket and in
matters of travelling he always arrived at stations with plenty of time
to spare and had such creature comforts as he desired for his journey
in a neat Gladstone bag above his head He never travelled firstclass
for the very simple and adequate reason that though very well off
he preferred to spend his money in ways that were more productive of
usefulness or pleasure and thus when he took his place in the corner
of a secondclass compartment of the DoverOstend express on the
Wednesday morning following he was the only occupant of it

Probably he had never felt so fully at liberty nor enjoyed a keener
zest for life and the future For the first time he had asserted his own
indisputable right to stand on his own feet and though he was genuinely
sorry for his fathers chagrin at not being able to tuck him up in
the family coach his own sense of independence could not but wave its
banners There had been a second interview no less fruitless than the
first and Lord Ashbridge had told him that when next his presence was
desired at home he would be informed of the fact His mother had cried
in a mild trickling fashion but it was quite obvious that in her
heart of hearts she was more concerned with a bilious attack of peculiar
intensity that had assailed Petsy She wished Michael would not be so
disobedient and vex his father but she was quite sure that before
long some formula in diplomatic phrase would be found on which
reconciliation could be based whereas it was highly uncertain whether
any formula could be found that would produce the desired effect on
Petsy whose illness she attributed to the shock of Ogs sudden and
disconcerting appearance on Saturday when all Petsys nervous force
was required to digest the copious cream Consequently though she threw
reproachful glances at Michael those directed at Barbara who was the
cause of the acuter tragedy were pointed with more penetrating blame
Indeed it is questionable whether Lady Ashbridge would have cried at
all over Michaels affairs had not Petsys also been in so lamentable
and critical a state

Just as the train began to move out of the station a young man rushed
across the platform eluded the embrace of the guard who attempted to
stop him with amazing agility and jumped into Michaels compartment
He slammed the door after him and leaned out apparently looking for
someone whom he soon saw

Just caught it Sylvia he shouted Send on my luggage will you
Its in the taxi still I think and I havent paid the man Goodbye
darling

He waved to her till the curving line took the platform out of sight
and then sat down with a laugh and eyes of friendly interest for
Michael

Narrow squeak wasnt it he said gleefully I thought the guard had
collared me And I should have missed Parsifal

Michael had recognised him at once as he rushed across the platform his
shouting to Sylvia had but confirmed the recognition and here on the
day of his entering into his new kingdom of liberty was one of its
citizens almost thrown into his arms But for the moment his old
invincible habit of shyness and sensitiveness forbade any responsive
lightness of welcome and he was merely formal merely courteous

And all your luggage left behind he said Wont you be dreadfully
uncomfortable

Uncomfortable Why asked Falbe I shall buy a handkerchief and a
collar every day and a shirt and a pair of socks every other day till
it arrives

Michael felt a sudden daring impulse He remembered Aunt Barbaras
salutary remarks about crossness being the equivalent of thinking about
oneself And the effort that it cost him may be taken as the measure of
his solitary disposition

But you neednt do that he said ifif you will be good enough to
borrow of me till your things come

He blurted it out awkwardly almost brusquely and Falbe looked slightly
amused at this wholly surprising offer of hospitality

But thats awfully good of you he said laughing and saying nothing
direct about his acceptance It implies too that you are going
to Baireuth We travel together then I hope for it is dismal work
travelling alone isnt it My sister tells me that half my friends were
picked up in railway carriages Been there before

Michael felt himself lured from the ordinary aloofness of attitude and
demeanour which had been somewhat accustomed to view all strangers with
suspicion And yet though till this moment he had never spoken to him
he could hardly regard Falbe as a stranger for he had heard him say
on the piano what his sister understood by the songs of Brahms and
Schubert He could not help glancing at Falbes hands as they busied
themselves with the filling and lighting of a pipe and felt that he
knew something of those long broadtipped fingers smooth and white and
strong The man himself he found to be quite different to what he had
expected he had seen him before eager and intent and anxiousfaced
absorbed in the task of following another mind now he looked much
younger much more boyish

No its my first visit to Baireuth he said and I cant tell you
how excited I am about it Ive been looking forward to it so much that
I almost expect to be disappointed

Falbe blew out a cloud of smoke and laughter

Oh youre safe enough he said Baireuth never disappoints Its
one of the factsa reliable fact And Munich Do you go to Munich
afterwards

Yes I hope so

Falbe clicked with his tongue

Lucky fellow he said How I wish I was But Ive got to get back
again after my week Youll spend the mornings in the galleries and the
afternoons and evenings at the opera O Lord Munich

He came across from the other side of the carriage and sat next Michael
putting his feet up on the seat opposite

Talk of Munich he said I was born in Munich and I happen to know
that its the heavenly Jerusalem neither more nor less

Well the heavenly Jerusalem is practically next door to Baireuth
said Michael

I know but it cant be managed However theres a week of unalloyed
bliss between me now and the desolation of London in August What is
so maddening is to think of all the people who could go to Munich and
dont

Michael held debate within himself He felt that he ought to tell his
new acquaintance that he knew who he was that however trivial their
conversation might be it somehow resembled eavesdropping to talk to
a chance fellowpassenger as if he were a complete stranger But it
required again a certain effort to make the announcement

I think I had better tell you he said at length that I know you
that Ive listened to you at least at your sisters recital a few days
ago

Falbe turned to him with the friendliest pleasure

Ah were you there he asked I hope you listened to her then not
to me She sang well didnt she

But divinely At the same time I did listen to you especially in the
French songs There was less song you know

Falbe laughed

And more accompaniment he said Perhaps you play

Michael was seized with a fit of shyness at the idea of talking to Falbe
about himself

Oh I just strum he said


Throughout the journey their acquaintanceship ripened and casually
in dropped remarks the two began to learn something about each other
Falbes command of English as well as his sisters which was so
complete that it was impossible to believe that a foreigner was
speaking was explained for it came out that his mother was
English and that from infancy they had spoken German and English
indiscriminately His father who had died some dozen years before had
been a singer of some note in his native land but was distinguished
more for his teaching than his practice and it was he who had taught
his daughter Hermann Falbe himself had always intended to be a pianist
but the poverty in which they were left at his fathers death had
obliged him to give lessons rather than devote himself to his own
career but now at the age of thirty he found himself within sight of
the competence that would allow him to cut down his pupils and begin to
be a pupil again himself

His sister moreover for whom he had slaved for years in order that she
might continue her own singing education unchecked was now more than
able especially after these last three months in London where she had
suddenly leaped into eminence to support herself and contributed to the
expenses of their common home But there was still so Michael gathered
no great superabundance of money and he guessed that Falbes inability
to go to Munich was due to the question of expense

All this came out by inference and allusion rather than by direct
information while Michael naturally reticent and feeling that his
own uneventful affairs could have no interest for anybody was
less communicative And indeed while shunning the appearance
of inquisitiveness he was far too eager to get hold of his new
acquaintance to think of volunteering much himself Here to him was this
citizen of the new country who all his life had lived in the palace of
art and that in no dilettante fashion but with set aim and serious
purpose And Falbe abounded in such topics he knew the singers and
the musicians of the world and which was much more than that he was
himself of them humble no doubt in circumstances and achievement as
yet but clearly to Michael of the blood royal of artistry That was
the essential thing about him as regards his relations with his
fellowtraveller though when next morning the spires of Cologne and
the swift river of his Fatherland came into sight he burst out into a
sort of rhapsody of patriotism that mockingly covered a great sincerity

Ah beloved land he cried Soil of heaven and of divine harmony
Hail to thee Hail to thee Rhine Rhine deep and true and steadfast
   And he waved his hat and sang the greeting of Brunnhilde Then he
turned laughingly to Michael

I am sufficiently English to know how ridiculous that must seem to
you he said for I love England also and the passengers on the boat
would merely think me mad if I apostrophised the cliffs of Dover and
the mud of the English roads But here I am a German again and I would
willingly kiss the soil You Englishwe English I may say for I am as
much English as GermanI believe have got the same feeling somewhere in
our hearts but we lock it up and hide it away Pray God I shall never
have to choose to which nation I belong though for that matter there in
no choice in it at all for I am certainly a German subject Guten Tag
Koln let us instantly have our coffee There is no coffee like German
coffee though the French coffee is undeniably pleasanter to the mere
superficial palate But it doesnt touch the heart as everything German
touches my heart when I come back to the Fatherland

He chattered on in tremendous high spirits

And to think that tonight we shall sleep in true German beds he
said I allow that the duvet is not so convenient as blankets and that
there is a watershed always up the middle of your bed so that during
the night your person descends to one side while the duvet rolls
down the other but it is German which makes up for any trifling
inconvenience Baireuth too perhaps it will strike you as a dull and
stinking little town and so I dare say it is But after lunch we shall
go up the hillside to where the theatre stands at the edge of the
pinewoods and from the porch the trumpets will give out the motif of
the Grail and we shall pass out of the heat into the cool darkness of
the theatre Arent you thrilled Comber Doesnt a holy awe pervade
you Are you worthy do you think

All this youthful unrestrained enthusiasm was a revelation to Michael
Intentionally absurd as Falbes rhapsody on the Fatherland had been
Michael knew that it sprang from a solid sincerity which was not ashamed
of expressing itself Living as he had always done in the rather
formal and reticent atmosphere of his class and environment he would
have thought this fervour of patriotism in an English mouth ridiculous
or if persevered in merely bad form Yet when Falbe hailed the Rhine
and the spires of Cologne it was clear that there was no bad form about
it at all He felt like that and indeed as Michael was beginning to
perceive he felt with a similar intensity on all subjects about which
he felt at all There was something of the same vivid quality about Aunt
Barbara but Aunt Barbaras vividness was chiefly devoted to the hunt
of the absurdities of her friends and it was always the concretely
ridiculous that she pursued But this handsome vital young man with
his eagerness and his welcome for the world who had fallen with
so delightful a cordiality into Michaels company had already an
attraction for him of a sort he had never felt before

Dimly as the days went by he began to conjecture that he who had never
had a friend was being hailed and halloed to was being ordered if
not by precept at any rate by example to come out of the shell of his
reserve and let himself feel and let himself express He could see how
utterly different was Falbes general conception and practice of
life from his own to Michael it had always been a congregation of
strangersFrancis exceptedwho moved about busy with each other and
with affairs that had no allure for him and were though not uncivil
wholly alien to him He was willing to grant that this alienation this
absence of comradeship which he had missed all his life was of his own
making in so far as his shyness and sensitiveness were the cause of it
but in effect he had never yet had a friend because he had never yet
taken his shutters down so to speak or thrown his front door open He
had peeped out through chinks and felt how lonely he was but he had
not given anyone a chance to get in

Falbe on the other hand lived at his window ready to hail the
passerby even as he had hailed Michael with cheerful words There
he lounged in his shirtsleeves you might say with elbows on the
windowsill and not from politeness but from good fellowship from the
fact that he liked people was at home to everybody He liked people
there was the key to it And Michael however much he might be capable
of liking people had up till now given them no sign of it It really
was not their fault if they had not guessed it

Two days passed on the first of which Parsifal was given and on the
second Meistersinger On the third there was no performance and the two
young men had agreed to meet in the morning and drive out of the town to
a neighbouring village among the hills and spend the day there in
the woods Michael had looked forward to this day with extraordinary
pleasure but there was mingled with it a sort of agony of apprehension
that Falbe would find him a very boring companion But the precepts of
Aunt Barbara came to his mind and he reflected that the certain and
sure way of proving a bore was to be taken up with the idea that he
might be And anyhow Falbe had proposed the plan himself

They lunched in a little restaurant near a forestenclosed lake and
since the day was very hot did no more than stroll up the hill for a
hundred yards where they would get some hint of breeze and disposed
themselves at length on the carpet of pineneedles Through the thick
boughs overhead the sunlight reached them only in specks and flakes the
wind was but as a distant sea in the branches and Falbe rolled over
on to his face and sniffed at the aromatic leaves with the gusto with
which he enjoyed all that was to him enjoyable

Ah thats good thats good he said How I love smellsclean
sharp smells like this But theyve got to be wild you cant tame a
smell and put it on your handkerchief it takes the life out of it Do
you like smells Comber

II really never thought about it said Michael

Think now then and tell me said Falbe If you consider you know
such a lot about me and as a matter of fact I know nothing whatever
about you I know you like musicI know you like blue trout because
you ate so many of them at lunch today But what else do I know about
you I dont even know what you thought of Parsifal No perhaps Im
wrong there because the fact that youve never mentioned it probably
shows that you couldnt The symptom of not understanding anything about
Parsifal is to talk about it and say what a tremendous impression it
has made on you

Ah youve guessed right there said Michael I couldnt talk about
it theres nothing to say about it except that it is Parsifal

Thats true It becomes part of you and you cant talk of it any more
than you can talk about your elbows and your knees Its one of the
things that makes you   

He turned over on to his back and laid his hands palm uppermost over
his eyes

Thats part of the glory of it all he said that art and its
emotions become part of you like the food you eat and the wine you
drink Art is always making us it enters into our character and
destiny As long as you go on growing you assimilate and thank God
ones mind or soul or whatever you like to call it goes on growing for
a long time I suppose the moment comes to most people when they cease
to grow when they become fixed and hard and that is what we mean by
being old But till then you weave your destiny or rather people and
beauty weave it for you as youll see the Norns weaving and yet you
never know what you are making You make what you are and you never
are because you are always becoming You must excuse me but Germans are
always metaphysicians and they cant help it

Go on be German said Michael

Lieber Gott As if I could be anything else said Falbe laughing
We are the only nation which makes a science of experimentalism we try
everything just as a puppy tries everything It tries mutton bones and
matchboxes and soap and boots it tries to find out what its tail is
for and bites it till it hurts on which it draws the conclusion that
it is not meant to eat Like all metaphysicians too and dealers in the
abstract we are intensely practical Our passion for experimentalism
is dictated by the firm object of using the knowledge we acquire We
are tremendously thorough we waste nothing not even time whereas
the English have an absolute genius for wasting time Look at all your
games your sports your athleticsI am being quite German now and
forgetting my mother bless herthey are merely devices for getting
rid of the hours and so not having to think You hate thought as
a nation and we live for it Music is thought all art is thought
commercial prosperity is thought soldiering is thought

And we are a nation of idiots asked Michael

No I didnt say that I should say you are a nation of sensualists
You value sensation above everything you pursue the enjoyable You are
a nation of children who are always having a perpetual holiday You go
straying all over the world for fun and annex it generally so that
you can have tigershooting in India and lots of gold to pay for your
tigershooting in Africa and fur from Canada for your coats But
its all a game not one man in a thousand in England has any idea of
Empire

Oh I think you are wrong there said Michael You believe that only
because we dont talk about it Itsits like what we agreed about
Parsifal We dont talk about it because it is so much part of us

Falbe sat up

I deny it I deny it flatly he said I know where I get my power of
foolish unthinking enjoyment from and its from my English blood I
rejoice in my English blood because you are the happiest people on the
face of the earth But you are happy because you dont think whereas
the joy of being German is that you do think England is lying in the
shade like us with a cigarette and a drinkI wish I had oneand a
golf ball or the world with which she has been playing her game But
Germany is sitting up all night thinking and every morning she gives an
order or two

Michael supplied the cigarette

Do you mean she is thinking about Englands golf ball asked Michael

Why of course she is What else is there to think about

Oh its impossible that there should be a European war said Michael
for that is what it will mean

And why is a European war impossible demanded Falbe lighting his
cigarette

Its simply unthinkable

Because you dont think he interrupted I can tell you that the
thought of war is never absent for a single day from the average German
mind We are all soldiers you see We start with that You start by
being golfers and cricketers But der Tag is never quite absent
from the German mind I dont say that all you golfers and cricketers
wouldnt make good soldiers but youve got to be made You cant be a
golfer one day and a soldier the next

Michael laughed

As for that he said I made an uncommonly bad soldier But I am an
even worse golfer As for cricket

Falbe again interrupted

Ah then at last I know two things about you he said You were a
soldier and you cant play golf I have never known so little about
anybody after threefour days However what is our proverb Live and
learn But it takes longer to learn than to live Eh what nonsense I
talk

He spoke with a sudden irritation and the laugh at the end of his
speech was not one of amusement but rather of mockery To Michael this
mood was quite inexplicable but characteristically he looked about in
himself for the possible explanation of it

But whats the matter he asked Have I annoyed you somehow Im
awfully sorry

Falbe did not reply for a moment

No youve not annoyed me he said Ive annoyed myself But thats
the worst of living on ones nerves which is the penalty of Baireuth
There is no charge so to speak except for your ticket but a
collection is made as happens at meetings and you pay with your
nerves You must cancel my annoyance please If I showed it I did not
mean to

Michael pondered over this

But I cant leave it like that he said at length Was it about the
possibility of war which I said was unthinkable

Falbe laughed and turned on his elbow towards Michael

No my dear chap he said You may believe it to be unthinkable and
I may believe it to be inevitable but what does it matter what either
of us believes Che sara sara It was quite another thing that caused me
to annoy myself It does not matter

Michael lay back on the soft slope

Yet I insist on knowing he said That is I mean if it is not
private

Falbe lay quietly with his long fingers in the sediment of pineneedles

Well then as it is not private and as you insist he said I will
certainly tell you Does it not strike you that you are behaving like an
absolute stranger to me We have talked of me and my home and my
plans all the time since we met at Victoria Station and you have kept
complete silence about yourself I know nothing of you not who you are
or what you are or what your flag is You fly no flag you proclaim no
identity You may be a crossingsweeper or a grocer or a marquis for
all I know Of course that matters very little but what does matter is
that never for a moment have you shown me not what you happen to be
but what you are Ive got the impression that you are something that
theres a real you in your inside But you dont let me see it You
send a polite servant to the door when I knock Probably this sounds
very weird and unEnglish to you But to my mind it is much more weird
to behave as you are behaving Come out cant you Lets look at you

It was exactly thatthat brusque unsentimental appealthat Michael
needed He saw himself at that moment as Falbe saw him a shelled and
muffled figure intangible and withdrawn but observing as it were
through eyeholes and giving nothing in exchange for what he saw

Im sorry he said Its quite true what you tell me Im like that
But it really has never struck me that anybody cared to know

Falbe ceased digging his excavation in the pineneedles and looked up on
Michael

Good Lord man he said people care if youll only allow them to
The indifference of other people is a false term for the secretiveness
of oneself How can they care unless you let them know what there is to
care for

But Im completely uninteresting said Michael

Yes Ill judge of that said Falbe


Slowly and with diffident pauses Michael began to speak of himself
feeling at first as if he was undressing in public But as he went on
he became conscious of the welcome that his story received though that
welcome only expressed itself in perfectly unemotional monosyllables He
might be undressing but he was undressing in front of a fire He knew
that he uncovered himself to no icy blast or contemptuous rain as he
had felt when so few days before he had spoken of himself and what
he was to his father There was here the common land of music to build
upon whereas to Lord Ashbridge that same soil had been so to speak
the territory of the enemy And even more than that there was the
instinct the certain conviction that he was telling his tale to
sympathetic ears to which the mere fact that he was speaking of himself
presupposed a friendly hearing Falbe he felt wanted to know about
him regardless of the nature of his confessions Had he said that he
was an undetected kleptomaniac Falbe would have liked to know have
been pleased at any tidings provided only they were authentic This
seemed to reveal itself to him even as he spoke it had been there
waiting for him to claim it lying there as in a poste restante only
ready for its owner

At the end Falbe gave a long sigh

And why the devil didnt you give me any hint of it before he asked

I didnt think it mattered said Michael

Well then you are amazingly wrong Good Lord its about the most
interesting thing Ive ever heard I didnt know anybody could escape
from that awful sort of prisonhouse in which ourIm English nowin
which our upper class immures itself Yet youve done it I take it that
the thing is done now

Im not going back into the prisonhouse again if you mean that said
Michael

And will your father cut you off asked he

Oh I havent the least idea said Michael

Arent you going to inquire

Michael hesitated

No Im sure Im not he said I cant do that Its his business
I couldnt ask about what he had done or meant to do Its a sort
of pride I suppose He will do as he thinks proper and when he has
thought perhaps he will tell me what he intends

But then how will you live asked Falbe

Oh I forgot to tell you that Ive got some money quite a lot I
mean from my grandmother In some ways I rather wish I hadnt It would
have been a proof of sincerity to have become poor That wouldnt have
made the smallest difference to my resolution

Falbe laughed

And so you are rich and yet go secondclass he said If I were rich
I would make myself exceedingly comfortable I like things that are
good to eat and soft to touch But Im bound to say that I get on
quite excellently without them Being poor does not make the smallest
difference to ones happiness but only to the number of ones
pleasures

Michael paused a moment and then found courage to say what for the last
two days he had been longing to give utterance to

I know but pleasures are very nice things he said And doesnt it
seem obvious now that you are coming to Munich with me Its a purely
selfish suggestion on my part After being with you it will be very
stupid to be alone there But it would be so delightful if you would
come

Falbe looked at him a moment without speaking but Michael saw the light
in his eyes

And what if I have my pride too he said Then I shall apologise for
having made the proposal said Michael simply

For just a second more Falbe hesitated Then he held out his hand

I thank you most awfully he said I accept with the greatest
pleasure

Michael drew a long breath of relief

I am glad he said So thats settled Its really nice of you

The heat of the day was passing off and over the sunbleached plain the
coolness of evening was beginning to steal Overhead the wind stirred
more resonantly in the pines and in the bushes birds called to each
other Presently after they rose from where they had lain all the
afternoon and strolled along the needled slope to where through a vista
in the trees they looked down on the lake and the hamlet that clustered
near it Down the road that wound through the trees towards it passed
labourers going homeward from their work with cheerful guttural cries
to each other and a herd of cows sauntered by with bells melodiously
chiming taking leisurely mouthfuls from the herbage of the wayside
In the village lying low in the clear dusk scattered lights began to
appear the smoke of evening fires to ascend and the aromatic odour of
the burning wood strayed towards them up the wind

Falbe whose hand lay in the crook of Michaels arm pointed downwards
to the village that lay there sequestered and rural

Thats Germany he said its that which lies at the back of every
German heart There lie the springs of the Rhine Its out of that
originally that there came all that Germany stands for its music its
poetry its philosophy its kultur All flowed from these quiet uplands
It was here that the nation began to think and to dream To dreamt Its
out of dreams that all has sprung

He laughed

And then next week when we go to Munich you will find me saying that
this this Athens of a town with its museums and its galleries and its
music is Germany I shall be right too Out of much dreaming comes
the need to make It is when the artists head and heart are full of
his dreams that his hands itch for the palette or the piano Nuremberg
Cannot we stop a few hours at least in Nuremberg and see the meadow
by the Pegnitz where the Meistersingers held their contest of song and
the wooden gabled house where Albrecht Durer lived That will teach you
Germany too The bud of their dream was opening then and what flower
even in the magnificence of its fullblowing is so lovely Albrecht
Durer with his deep patient eyes and his patient hands with their
unerring stroke or Bach with the fugue flowing from his brain through
his quick fingers making starsstars fixed forever in the heaven
of harmony Dont tell me that there is anything in the world more
wonderful We may have invented a few more instruments we may have
experimented with a few more combinations of notes but in the B minor
Mass or in the music of the Passion all is said And all that came
from the woods and the country and the quiet life in little towns when
the artist did his work because he loved it and cared not one jot about
what anybody else thought about it We are a nation of thinkers and
dreamers

Michael hesitated a moment

But you said not long ago that you were also the most practical
nation he said You are a nation of soldiers also

And who would not willingly give himself for such a Fatherland said
Falbe If need be we will lay our lives down for that and die more
willingly than we have lived God grant that the need comes not But
should it come we are ready We are bound to be ready it would be a
crime not to be readya crime against the Fatherland We love peace
but the peacelovers are just those who in war are most terrible For
who are the backbone of war when war comes The women of the country
my friend not the ministers not the generals and the admirals I
dont say they make war but when war is made they are the spirit of it
because more than men they love their homes There is not a woman
in Germany who will not send forth brother and husband and father and
child should the day come But it will not come from our seeking

He turned to Michael his face illuminated by the red glow of the
sinking sun

Germany will rise as one man if shes told to he said for that is
what her unity and her discipline mean She is patient and peaceful but
she is obedient

He pointed northwards

It is from there from Prussia from Berlin he said that the word
will come if they who rule and govern us and in whose hands are all
organisation and equipment tell us that our national existence compels
us to fight They rule The Prussians rule there is no doubt of that
From Germany have come the arts the sciences the philosophies of the
world and not from there But they guard our national life It is they
who watch by the Rhine for us patient and awake Should they beckon us
one night on some peaceful August night like this when all seems so
tranquil so secure we shall go The silent beckoning finger will be
obeyed from one end of the land to the other from Poland on the east to
France on the west

He turned away quickly

It does not bear thinking of he said and yet there are many oh so
many who night and day concern themselves with nothing else Let us be
English again and not think of anything serious or unpleasant Already
as you know I am half English there is something to build upon Ah
and this is the sentimental hour just when the sun begins to touch the
horizon line of the stale weary old earth and turns it into rosy gold
and heals its troubles and its weariness Schon Schon

He stood for a moment bareheaded to the breeze and made a great florid
salutation to the sun now only halfdisk above the horizon

There I have said my evensong he remarked like a good German who
always and always is ridiculous to the whole world except those who are
German also Oh I can see how we look to the rest of the world so well
Beer mug in one hand and mouth full of sausage and song and with the
other hand perhaps fingering a revolver How unreal it must seem to
you how affected and yet how in truth you miss it all Scratch a
Russian they say and you find a Tartar but scratch a German and you
find two thingsa sentimentalist and a soldier Lieber Gott No I will
say Good God I am English again and if you scratch me you will find a
golf ball

He took Michaels arm again

Well weve spent one day together he said and now we know
something of who we are I put this day in the bank its mine or yours
or both of ours I wont tell you how Ive enjoyed it or you will say
that I have enjoyed it because I have talked almost all the time But
since its the sentimental hour I will tell you that you mistake I have
enjoyed it because I believe I have found a friend


CHAPTER V


Hermann Falbe had just gone back to his lodgings at the end of the
Richard Wagner Strasse late on the night of their last day at Baireuth
and Michael who had leaned out of his window to remind him of the hour
of their trains departure the next morning turned back into the room
to begin his packing That was not an affair that would take much time
but since on this sweltering August night it would certainly be a
process that involved the production of much heat he made ready for bed
first and went about his preparations in pyjamas The work of dropping
things into a bag was soon over and finding it impossible to entertain
the idea of sleep he drew one of the stiff plushcovered armchairs to
the window and slipped the rein from his thoughts letting them gallop
where they pleased

In all his life he had never experienced so much sheer emotion as the
last week had held for him He had enjoyed his first taste of liberty
he had stripped himself naked to music he had found a friend Any one
of these would have been sufficient to saturate him and they had all
in the decrees of Fate come together His life hitherto had been like
some dry sponge dusty and crackling now it was plunged in the waters
of three seas all incomparably sweet

He had gained his liberty and in that process he had forgotten about
himself the self which up till now had been so intolerable a burden At
school and even before when first the age of selfconsciousness dawned
upon him he had seen himself as he believed others saw hima queer
awkward illmade boy slow at his work shy with his fellows incapable
at games Walled up in this fortress of himself this gloomy and
forbidding fastness he had altogether failed to find the means of
access to others both to the normal English boys among whom his path
lay and also to his teachers who not unnaturally found him sullen
and unresponsive There was no key among the rather limited bunches at
their command which unlocked him nor at home had anything been found
which could fit his wards It had been the business of school to turn
out boys of certain received types There was the clever boy the
athletic boy the merely pleasant boy these and the combinations
arrived at from these types were the output There was no use for
others

Then had succeeded those three nightmare years in the Guards where
with his more mature power of observation he had become more actively
conscious of his inability to take his place on any of the recognised
platforms And all the time like an owl on his solitary perch he had
gazed out lonelily while the other birds of day too polite to mock
him had merely passed him by One such it is truehis cousinhad sat
by him and the poor owls heart had gone out to him But even Francis
so he saw now had not understood He had but accepted the fact of him
without repugnance had been fond of him as a queer sort of kind elder
cousin

Then there was Aunt Barbara Aunt Barbara Michael allowed had
understood a good deal she had pointed out with her unerringly
humourous finger the obstacles he had made for himself

But could Aunt Barbara understand the rapture of living which this
one week of liberty had given him That Michael doubted She had only
pointed out the disabilities he made for himself She did not know
what he was capable of in the way of happiness But he thought though
without selfconsciousness how delightful it would be to show himself
the new unshelled self to Aunt Barbara again

A laughing couple went tapping down the street below his window boy and
girl with arms and waists interlaced They were laughing at nothing at
all except that they were boy and girl together and it was all glorious
fun But the sight of them gave Michael a sudden spasm of envy With all
this enlightenment that had come to him during this last week there had
come no gleam of what that simplest and commonest aspect of human nature
meant He had never felt towards a girl what that roundfaced German
boy felt He was not sure but he thought he disliked girls they meant
nothing to him anyhow and the mere thought of his arm round a girls
waist only suggested a very embarrassing attitude He had nothing to
say to them and the knowledge of his inability filled him with
an uncomfortable sense of his want of normality just as did the
consciousness of his long arms and stumpy legs

There was a night he remembered when Francis had insisted that he should
go with him to a discreet little supper party after an evening at
the musichall There were just four of themhe Francis and two
companionsand he played the role of sour gooseberry to his cousin
who with the utmost gaiety had proved himself completely equal to the
inauspicious occasion and had drank indiscriminately out of both the
girls glasses and lit cigarettes for them and after seeing them both
home had looked in on Michael and gone into fits of laughter at his
general incompatibility

The steps and conversation passed round the corner and Michael
stretching his bare toes on to the cool balcony resumed his
researchesthose joyful unegoistic researches into himself His
liberty was bound up with his music the first gave the key to the
second Often as he had rested so to speak in oases of music in
London they were but a pause from the desert of his uncongenial life
into the desert again But now the desert was vanished and the oasis
stretched illimitable to the horizon in front of him That was where
for the future his life was to be passed not idly sitting under
trees but in the eager pursuit of its unnumbered paths It was that
aspect of it which as he knew so well his father for instance would
never be able to understand To Lord Ashbridges mind music was
vaguely connected with white waistcoats and opera glasses and large pink
carnations he was congenitally incapable of viewing it in any other
light than a diversion something that took place between nine and
eleven oclock in the evening and in smaller quantities at church on
Sunday morning He would undoubtedly have said that Handels Messiah was
the noblest example of music in the world because of its subject music
did not exist for him as a separate definite and infinite factor of
life and since it did not so exist for himself he could not imagine
it existing for anybody else That Michael correctly knew to be his
fathers general demeanour towards life he wanted everybody in their
respective spheres to be like what he was in his They must take their
part as he undoubtedly did in the Creationscheme when the British
aristocracy came into being

A fresh factor had come into Michaels conception of music during these
last seven days He had become aware that Germany was music He had
naturally known before that the vast proportion of music came from
Germany that almost all of that which meant music to him was of
German origin but that was a very different affair from the conviction
now borne in on his mind that there was not only no music apart from
Germany but that there was no Germany apart from music

But every moment he spent in this wayside puddle of a town for so
Baireuth seemed to an unbiased view he became more and more aware that
music beat in the German blood even as sport beat in the blood of his
own people During this festival week Baireuth existed only because of
that at other times Baireuth was probably as nonexistent as any dull
and minor town in the English Midlands But owing to the fact of music
being for these weeks resident in Baireuth the sordid little townlet
became the capital of the huge patient Empire It existed just now
simply for that reason tonight with the curtain of the last act of
Parsifal it had ceased to exist again It was not that a patriotic
desire to honour one of the national heroes in the home where he had
been established by the mad genius of a Bavarian king that moved them
it was because for the moment that Baireuth to Germans meant Germany
From Berlin from Dresden from Frankfurt from Luxemburg from a
hundred towns those who were most typically German whether high or
low rich or poor made their joyous pilgrimage Joy and solemnity
exultation and the yearning that could never be satisfied drew them
here And even as music was in Michaels heart so Germany was there
also They were the people who understood they did not go to the opera
as a bediamonded interlude between a dinner and a dance they came
to this dreadful little town the discomforts of which the utter
provinciality of which was transformed into the air of the heavenly
Jerusalem as Hermann Falbe had said because their souls were fed here
with wine and manna He would find the same thing at Munich so Falbe
had told him the next week

The loves and the tragedies of the great titanic forces that saw
the making of the world the dreams and the deeds of the masters of
Nuremberg above all sacrifice and enlightenment and redemption of the
soul how except by music could these be made manifest It was the
first and only and final alchemy that could by its magic transformation
give an answer to the tremendous riddles of consciousness that could
lift you though tearing and making mincemeat of you to the serenity
of the Pisgahtop whence was seen the promised land It in itself was
reality and the doorkeeper who admitted you into that enchanted
realm was the spirit of Germany Not France with its little morbid
shiverings and its meatmarket called love not Italy with its
melodious declamations and tawdry tunes not Russia even with the wind
of its impenetrable winters its sense of joys snatched from its eternal
frosts gave admittance there but Germany deep patient Germany that
sprang from upland hamlets and flowed down with everbroadening stream
into the illimitable ocean

Here then were two of the initiations that had come with the
swiftness of the spate in Alpine valleys at the melting of the snow
upon Michael his own liberty namely and this new sense of music He
had groped he felt now like a blind man in that direction guided only
by his instinct and on a sudden the scales had fallen from his eyes
and he knew that his instinct had guided him right But not less
epochmaking had been the dawn of friendship Throughout the week his
intimacy with Hermann Falbe had developed shooting up like an
aloe flower and rising into sunlight above the mists of his own
selfoccupied shyness which had so darkly beset him all life long He
had given the best that he knew of himself to his cousin but all
the time there had never quite been absent from his mind his sense
of inferiority a sort of aching wonder why he could not be more like
Francis more careless more capable of enjoyment more of a normal
type But with Falbe he was able for the first time to forget himself
altogether he had met a man who did not recall him to himself but
took him clean out of that tedious dwelling which he knew so well and
indeed disliked so much He was rid for the first time of his morbid
selfconsciousness his anchor had been taken up from its dragging in
the sand and he rode free buoyed on waters and taken by tides It
did not occur to him to wonder whether Falbe thought him uncouth and
awkward it did not occur to him to try to be pleasant a job over which
poor Michael had so often found himself dishearteningly incapable he
let himself be himself in the consciousness that this was sufficient

They had spent the morning together before this second performance of
Parsifal that closed their series in the woods above the theatre and
Michael no longer blurting out his speeches but speaking in the quiet
orderly manner in which he thought discussed his plans

I shall come back to London with you after Munich he said and
settle down to study I do know a certain amount about harmony already
I have been mugging it up for the last three years But I must do
something as well as learn something and as I told you Im going to
take up the piano seriously

Falbe was not attending particularly

A fine instrument the piano he remarked There is certainly
something to be done with a piano if you know how to do it I can strum
a bit myself Some keys are harder than othersthe black notes

Yes what of the black notes asked Michael

Oh theyre black The rest are white I beg your pardon

Michael laughed

When you have finished drivelling he said you might let me know

I have finished drivelling Michael I was thinking about something
else

Not really

Really

Then it was impolite of you but you havent any manners I was talking
about my career I want to do something and these large hands are
really rather nimble But I must be taught The question is whether you
will teach me

Falbe hesitated

I cant tell you he said till I have heard you play Its like
this I cant teach you to play unless you know how and I cant tell
if you know how until I have heard you If you have got that particular
sort of temperament that can put itself into the notes out of the ends
of your fingers I can teach you and I will But if you havent I
shall feel bound to advise you to try the Jews harp and see if you can
get it out of your teeth Im not mocking you I fancy you know that
But some people however keenly and rightly they feel cannot bring
their feelings out through their fingers Others can it is a special
gift If you havent got it I cant teach you anything and there is
no use in wasting your time and mine You can teach yourself to be
frightfully nimble with your fingers and all the people who dont
know will say How divinely Lord Comber plays That sweet thing is it
Brahms or Mendelssohn But I cant really help you towards that you
can do that for yourself But if youve got the other I can and will
teach you all that you really know already

Go on said Michael

Thats just the devil with the piano said Falbe Its the easiest
instrument of all to make a show on and it is the rarest sort of person
who can play on it Thats why all those years I have hated giving
lessons If one has to as I have had to one must take any awful miss
with a pigtail and make a sham pianist of her One can always do that
But it would be waste of time for you and me you wouldnt want to be
made a sham pianist and simply I wouldnt make you one

Michael turned round

Good Lord he said the suspense is worse than I can bear Isnt
there a piano in your room Cant we go down there and have it over

Yes if you wish I can tell at once if you are capable of playingat
least whether I think you are capable of playingwhether I can teach
you

But I havent touched a piano for a week said Michael

It doesnt matter whether youve touched a piano for a year

Michael had not been prevented by the economy that made him travel
secondclass from engaging a carriage by the day at Baireuth since
that clearly was worth while and they found it waiting for them by
the theatre There was still time to drive to Falbes lodging and get
through this crucial ordeal before the opera and they went straight
there A very venerable instrument which Falbe had not yet opened
stood against the wall and he struck a few notes on it

Completely out of tune he said but that doesnt matter Now then

But what am I to play asked Michael

Anything you like

He sat down at the far end of the room put his long legs up on to
another chair and waited Michael sent a despairing glance at that
gay face suddenly grown grim and took his seat He felt a paralysing
conviction that Falbes judgment whatever that might turn out to be
would be right and the knowledge turned his fingers stiff From the few
notes that Falbe had struck he guessed on what sort of instrument his
ordeal was to take place and yet he knew that Falbe himself would have
been able to convey to him the sense that he could play though the
piano was all out of tune and there might be dumb disconcerting notes
in it There was justice in Falbes dictum about the temperament that
lay behind the player which would assert itself through any faultiness
of instrument and through so he suspected any faultiness of
execution

He struck a chord and heard it jangle dissonantly

Oh its not fair he said

Get on said Falbe

In spite of Germany there occurred to Michael a Chopin prelude at which
he had worked a little during the last two months in London The notes
he knew perfectly he had believed also that he had found a certain
conception of it as a whole so that he could make something coherent
out of it not merely adding bar to correct bar And he began the soft
repetition of chordquavers with which it opened

Then after stumbling wretchedly through two lines of it he suddenly
forgot himself and Falbe and the squealing unresponsive notes He heard
them no more absorbed in the knowledge of what he meant by them of the
mood which they produced in him His great ungainly hands had all the
gentleness and selfcontrol that strength gives and the fingerfilling
chords were as light and as fine as the settling of some poised bird on
a bough In the last few lines of the prelude a deep bass note had to be
struck at the beginning of each bar this Michael found was completely
dumb but so clear and vivid was the effect of it in his mind that he
scarcely noticed that it returned no answer to his finger    At the
end he sat without moving his hands dropped on to his knees

Falbe got up and coming over to the piano struck the bass note
himself

Yes I knew it was dumb he said but you made me think it wasnt
   You got quite a good tone out of it

He paused a moment again striking the dumb note as if to make sure
that it was soundless

Yes Ill teach you he said All the technique you have got you
know is wrong from beginning to end and you mustnt mind unlearning
all that But youve got the thing that matters


All this stewed and seethed in Michaels mind as he sat that night by
the window looking out on to the silent and empty street His thoughts
flowed without check or guide from his will wandering wherever their
course happened to take them now lingering like the water of a river
in some deep still pool when he thought of the friendship that
had come into his life now excitedly plunging down the foam of
swiftflowing rapids in the exhilaration of his newlyfound liberty
now proceeding with steady current at the thought of the weeks of
unremitting industry at a beloved task that lay in front of him He
could form no definite image out of these which should represent his
ordinary day it was all lost in a bright haze through which its shape
was but faintly discernible but life lay in front of him with promise
a thing to be embraced and greeted with welcome and eager hands instead
of being a mere marsh through which he had to plod with labouring steps
a business to be gone about without joy and without conviction in its
being worth while

He wondered for a moment as he rose to go to bed what his feelings
would have been if at the end of his performance on the sorethroated
and voiceless piano Falbe had said Im sorry but I cant do anything
with you As he knew Falbe intended for the future only to take a few
pupils and chiefly devote himself to his own practice with a view to
emerging as a concertgiver the next winter and as Michael had sat
down he remembered telling himself that there was really not the
slightest chance of his friend accepting him as a pupil He did not
intend that this rejection should make the smallest difference to his
aim but he knew that he would start his work under the tremendous
handicap of Falbe not believing that he had it in him to play and under
the disappointment of not enjoying the added intimacy which work with
and for Falbe would give him Then he had engaged in this tussle with
refractory notes till he quite lost himself in what he was playing
and thought no more either of Falbe or the piano but only of what the
melody meant to him But at the end when he came to himself again and
sat with dropped hands waiting for Falbes verdict he remembered how
his heart seemed to hang poised until it came He had rehearsed again
to himself his fixed determination that he would play and could play
whatever his friend might think about it but there was no doubt that he
waited with a greater suspense than he had ever known in his life before
for that verdict to be made known to him

Next day came their journey to Munich and the installation in the
best hotel in Europe Here Michael was host and the economy which he
practised when he had only himself to provide for and which made him
go secondclass when travelling was as usual completely abandoned now
that the pleasure of hospitality was his He engaged at once the best
double suite of rooms that the hotel contained two bedrooms with
bathrooms and an admirable sittingroom looking spaciously out on
to the square and with brusque decision silenced Falbes attempted
remonstrance Dont interfere with my show please he had said and
proceeded to inquire about a piano to be sent in for the week Then he
turned to his friend again Oh we are going to enjoy ourselves he
said with an irresistible sincerity

Tristan und Isolde was given on the third day of their stay there and
Falbe reading the morning German paper found news

The Kaiser has arrived he said Theres a truce in the army
manoeuvres for a couple of days and he has come to be present at
Tristan this evening Hes travelled three hundred miles to get here
and will go back tomorrow The ReiseKaiser you know

Michael looked up with some slight anxiety

Ought I to write my name or anything he asked He has stayed several
times with my father

Has he But I dont suppose it matters The visit is a
widelyadvertised incognito Thats his way God be with the
Allhighest he added

Well I shant said Michael But it would shock my father dreadfully
if he knew The Kaiser looks on him as the type and model of the English
nobleman

Michael crunched one of the inimitable breakfast rusks in his teeth

Lord what a day we had when he was at Ashbridge last year he said
We began at eight with a review of the Suffolk Yeomanry then we had a
pheasant shoot from eleven till three then the Emperor had out a steam
launch and careered up and down the river till six asking a thousand
questions about the tides and the currents and the navigable channels
Then he lectured us on the family portraits till dinner after dinner
there was a concert at which he conducted the Song to Aegir and then
there was a torchlight fandango by the tenants on the lawn He was on
his holiday you must remember

I heard the Song to Aegir once remarked Falbe with a perfectly
level intonation

I waserluckier said Michael politely because on that occasion I
heard it twice It was encored

And what did it sound like the second time asked Falbe

Much as before said Michael

The advent of the Emperor had put the whole town in a ferment Though
the visit was quite incognito an enormous military staff which had
been poured into the town might have led the thoughtful to suspect the
Kaisers presence even if it had not been announced in the largest type
in the papers and marchings and countermarchings of troops and sudden
bursts of national airs proclaimed the august presence He held an
informal review of certain Bavarian troops not out for manoeuvres in the
morning visited the sculpture gallery and pinacothek in the afternoon
and when Hermann and Michael went up to the theatre they found rows
of soldiers drawn up and inside unusual decorations over a section of
stalls which had been removed and was converted into an enormous box
This was in the centre of the first tier nearly at right angles to
where they sat in the front row of the same tier and when with
military punctuality the procession of uniforms headed by the Emperor
filed in the whole of the crowded house stood up and broke into a roar
of recognition and loyalty

For a minute or perhaps more the Emperor stood facing the house with
his hand raised in salute a figure the uprightness of which made him
look tall His brilliant uniform was ablaze with decorations he seemed
every inch a soldier and a leader of men For that minute he stood
looking neither to the right nor left stern and almost frowning with
no shadow of a smile playing on the tightlydrawn lips above which his
moustache was brushed upwards in two stiff protuberances towards his
eyes He was there just then not to see but to be seen his incognito
was momentarily in abeyance and he stood forth the supreme head of his
people the Allhighest War Lord who had come that day from the
field to which he would return across half Germany tomorrow It was an
impressive and dignified moment and Michael heard Falbe say to himself
Kaiserlich Kaiserlich

Then it was over The Emperor sat down beckoned to two of his officers
who had stood in a group far at the back of the box to join him and
with one on each side he looked about the house and chatted to them He
had taken out his operaglass which he adjusted using his right hand
only and looked this way and that as if incognito again he was
looking for friends in the house Once Michael thought that he looked
rather long and fixedly in his direction and then putting down his
glass he said something to one of the officers this time clearly
pointing towards Michael Then he gave some signal just raising his
hand towards the orchestra and immediately the lights were put down
the whole house plunged in darkness except where the lamps in the sunk
orchestra faintly illuminated the base of the curtain and the first
longing unsatisfied notes of the prelude began

The next hour passed for Michael in one unbroken mood of absorption The
supreme moment of knowing the music intimately and of never having seen
the opera before was his and all that he had dreamed of or imagined
as to the possibilities of music was flooded and drowned in the thing
itself You could not say that it was more gigantic than The Ring more
human than the Meistersingers more emotional than Parsifal but it
was utterly and wholly different to anything else he had ever seen or
conjectured Falbe he himself the thronged and silent theatre the
Emperor Munich Germany were all blotted out of his consciousness
He just watched as if discarnate the unrolling of the decrees of Fate
which were to bring so simple and overpowering a tragedy on the two who
drained the lovepotion together And at the end he fell back in his
seat feeling thrilled and tired exhilarated and exhausted

Oh Hermann he said what years Ive wasted

Falbe laughed

Youve wasted more than you know yet he said Hallo

A very resplendent officer had come clanking down the gangway next them
He put his heels together and bowed

Lord Comber I think he said in excellent English

Michael roused himself

Yes he said

His Imperial Majesty has done me the honour to desire you to come and
speak to him he said

Now said Michael

If you will be so good and he stood aside for Michael to pass up the
stairs in front of him

In the wide corridor behind he joined him again

Allow me to introduce myself as Count von Bergmann he said and
one of His Majestys aidesdecamp The Kaiser always speaks with
great pleasure of the visits he has paid to your father and he saw you
immediately he came into the theatre If you will permit me I would
advise you to bow but not very low respecting His Majestys incognito
to seat yourself as soon as he desires it and to remain till he gives
you some speech of dismissal Forgive me for going in front of you here
I have to introduce you to His Majestys presence

Michael followed him down the steps to the front of the box

Lord Comber Allhighest he said and instantly stood back

The Emperor rose and held out his hand and Michael bowing over it as
he took it felt himself seized in the famous grip of steel of which
its owner as well as its recipient was so conscious

I am much pleased to see you Lord Comber said he I could not
resist the pleasure of a little chat with you about our beloved England
And your excellent father how is he

He indicated a chair to Michael who as advised instantly took it
though the Emperor remained a moment longer standing

I left him in very good health Your Majesty said Michael

Ah I am glad to hear it I desire you to convey to him my friendliest
greetings and to your mother also I well remember my last visit to
his house above the tidal estuary at Ashbridge and I hope it may not be
very long before I have the opportunity to be in England again

He spoke in a voice that seemed rather hoarse and tired but his manner
expressed the most courteous cordiality His face which had been as
still as a statues when he showed himself to the house was now never
in repose for a moment He kept turning his head which he carried very
upright this way and that as he spoke now he would catch sight of
someone in the audience to whom he directed his glance now he would
peer over the edge of the low balustrade now look at the group of
officers who stood apart at the back of the box

His whole demeanour suggested a nervous highlystrung condition the
restlessness of it was that of a man overstrained who had lost the
capability of being tranquil Now he frowned now he smiled but never
for a moment was he quiet Then he launched a perfect hailstorm of
questions at Michael to the answers to which there was scarcely time
for more than a monosyllable in reply he listened with an eager and
a suspicious attention They were concerned at first with all sorts of
subjects inquired if Michael had been at Baireuth what he was going to
do after the Munich festival was over if he had English friends
here He inquired Falbes name looked at him for a moment through his
glasses and desired to know more about him Then learning he was a
teacher of the piano in England and had a sister who sang he expressed
great satisfaction

I like to see my subjects when there is no need for their services at
home he said learning about other lands and bringing also to other
lands the culture of the Fatherland even as it always gives me pleasure
to see the English here strengthening by the study of the arts the
bonds that bind our two great nations together You English must
learn to understand us and our great mission just as we must learn to
understand you

Then the questions became more specialised and concerned the state
of things in England He laughed over the disturbances created by the
Suffragettes was eager to hear what politicians thought about the state
of things in Ireland made specific inquiries about the Territorial
Force asked about the Navy the state of the drama in London the coal
strike which was threatened in Yorkshire Then suddenly he put a series
of personal questions

And you you are in the Guards I think he said

No sir I have just resigned my commission said Michael

Why Why is that Have many of your officers been resigning

I am studying music Your Majesty said Michael

I am glad to see you came to Germany to do it Berlin You ought to
spend a couple of months in Berlin Perhaps you are thinking of doing
so

He turned round quickly to one of his staff who had approached him

Well what is it he said

Count von Bergmann bowed low

The HerrDirector he said humbly craves to know whether it is Your
Majestys pleasure that the opera shall proceed

The Kaiser laughed

There Lord Comber he said you see how I am ordered about They
wish to cut short my conversation with you Yes Bergmann we will go
on You will remain with me Lord Comber for this act

Immediately after the lights were lowered again the curtain rose and
a most distracting hour began for Michael His neighbour was never still
for a single moment Now he would shift in his chair now with his hand
he would beat time on the red velvet balustrade in front of him and a
stream of whispered appreciation and criticism flowed from him

They are taking the opening scene a little too slow he said I shall
call the directors attention to that But that crescendo is well done
yes that is most effective The shawlobserve the beautiful lines
into which the shawl falls as she waves it That is wonderfula very
impressive entry Ah but they should not cross the stage yet it is
more effective if they remain longer there Brangane sings finely she
warns them that the doom is near

He gave a little giggle which reminded Michael of his father

Brangane is playing gooseberry as you say in England he said A big
gooseberry is she not Ah bravo bravo Wunderschon Yes enter King
Mark from his hunting Very fine Say I was particularly pleased with
the entry of King Mark Bergmann A wonderful act Wagner never touched
greater heights

At the end the Emperor rose and again held out his hand

I am pleased to have seen you Lord Comber he said Do not forget
my message to your father and take my advice and come to Berlin in the
winter We are always pleased to see the English in Germany

As Michael left the box he ran into the HerrDirector who had been
summoned to get a few hints

He went back to join Falbe in a state of republican irritation which
the honour that had been done him did not at all assuage There was an
hours interval before the third act and the two drove back to their
hotel to dine there But Michael found his friend wholly unsympathetic
with his chagrin To him it was quite clear the disappointment of not
having been able to attend very closely to the second act of Tristan was
negligible compared to the cause that had occasioned it It was possible
for the ordinary mortal to see Tristan over and over again but to
converse with the Kaiser was a thing outside the range of the average
man And again in this interval as during the act itself Michael
was bombarded with questions What did the Kaiser say Did he remember
Ashbridge Did Michael twice receive the iron grip Did the Allhighest
say anything about the manoeuvres Did he look tired or was it only the
light above his head that made him appear so haggard Even his opinion
about the opera was of interest Did he express approval

This was too much for Michael

My dear Hermann he said we alluded very cautiously to the Song to
Aegir this morning and delicately remarked that you had heard it once
and I twice How can you care what his opinion of this opera is

Falbe shook his handsome head and gesticulated with his fine hands

You dont understand he said You have just been talking to him
himself I long to hear his every word and intonation There is the
personality which to us means so much in which is summed up all
Germany It is as if I had spoken to Rule Britannia herself Would you
not be interested There is no one in the world who is to his country
what the Kaiser is to us When you told me he had stayed at Ashbridge I
was thrilled but I was ashamed lest you should think me snobbish which
indeed I am not But now I am past being ashamed

He poured out a glass of wine and drank it with a Hoch

In his hand lies peace and war he said It is as he pleases The
Emperor and his Chancellor can make Germany do exactly what they choose
and if the Chancellor does not agree with the Emperor the Emperor can
appoint one who does That is what it comes to that is why he is as
vast as Germany itself The Reichstag but advises where he is concerned
Have you no imagination Michael Europe lies in the hand that shook
yours

Michael laughed

I suppose I must have no imagination he said I dont picture it
even now when you point it out

Falbe pointed an impressive forefinger

But for him he said England and Germany would have been at each
others throats over the business at Agadir He held the warhounds in
leashhe their master who made them

Oh he made them anyhow said Michael

Naturally It is his business to be ready for any attack on the part of
those who are jealous at our power The whole Fatherland is a sword
in his hand which he sheathes It would long ago have leaped from the
scabbard but for him

Against whom asked Michael Who is the enemy

Falbe hesitated

There is no enemy at present he said but the enemy potentially is
any who tries to thwart our peaceful expansion

Suddenly the whole subject tasted bitter to Michael He recalled
instinctively the Emperors great curiosity to be informed on English
topics by the ordinary Englishman with whom he had acquaintance

Oh lets drop it he said I really didnt come to Munich to talk
politics of which I know nothing whatever

Falbe nodded

That is what I have said to you before he remarked You are the most
happygolucky of the nations Did he speak of England

Yes of his beloved England said Michael He was extremely cordial
about our relations

Good I like that said Falbe briskly

And he recommended me to spend two months in Berlin in the winter
added Michael sliding off on to other topics

Falbe smiled

I like that less he said since that will mean you will not be in
London

But I didnt commit myself said Michael smiling back though I can
say beloved Germany with equal sincerity

Falbe got up

I would wish thatthat you were Kaiser of England he said

God forbid said Michael I should not have time to play the piano

During the next day or two Michael often found himself chipping at
the bedrock so to speak of this conversation and Falbes revealed
attitude towards his country and in particular towards its supreme
head It seemed to him a wonderful and an enviable thing that anyone
could be so thoroughly English as Falbe certainly was in his ordinary
everyday life and that yet at the back of this there should lie
so profound a patriotism towards another country and so profound a
reverence to its ruler In his general outlook on life his friend
appeared to be entirely of one blood with himself yet now on two or
three occasions a chance spark had lit up this Teutonic beacon To
Michael this mixture of nationalities seemed to be a wonderful gift
it implied a widening of ones sympathies and outlook a larger
comprehension of life than was possible to any of undiluted blood

For himself like most young Englishmen of his day he was not conscious
of any tremendous sense of patriotism like this Somewhere deep down
in him he supposed there might be a source a well of English waters
which some explosion in his nature might cause to flood him entirely
but such an idea was purely hypothetical he did not in fact look
forward to such a bouleversement as being a possible contingency But
with Falbe it was different quite a small cause like the sight of
the Rhine at Cologne or a Bavarian village at sunset or the fact of a
friend having talked with the Emperor was sufficient to make his
innate patriotism find outlet in impassioned speech He wondered vaguely
whether Falbes explanation of thisnamely that nationally the English
were prosperous comfortable and insouciantwas perhaps sound It
seemed that the notion was not wholly foundationless


CHAPTER VI


Michael had been practising all the morning of a dark November day had
eaten a couple of sandwiches standing in front of his fire and observed
with some secret satisfaction that the fog which had lifted for an
hour had come down on the town again in earnest and that it was only
reasonable to dismiss the possibility of going out and spend the
afternoon as he had spent the morning But he permitted himself a few
minutes relaxation as he smoked his cigarette and sat down by the
window looking out in Lucretian mood on to the very dispiriting
conditions that prevailed in the street

Though it was still only between one and two in the afternoon the
densest gloom prevailed so that it was impossible to see the outlines
even of the houses across the street and the only evidence that he
was not in some desert spot lay in the fact of a few twinkling lights
looking incredibly remote from the windows opposite and the gaslamps
below Traffic seemed to be at a standstill the accustomed roar from
Piccadilly was dumb and he looked out on to a silent and vapourswathed
world This isolation from all his fellows and from the chances of being
disturbed it may be added gave him a sense of extreme satisfaction He
wanted his piano but no intrusive presence He liked the sensation of
being shut up in his own industrious citadel secure from interruption

During the last two months and a half since his return from Munich he
had experienced greater happiness had burned with a stronger zest for
life than during the whole of his previous existence Not only had he
been working at that which he believed he was fitted for and which gave
him the stimulus which one way or another is essential to all good
work but he had been thrown among people who were similarly employed
with whom he had this great common ground of kinship in ambition and
aim No more were the days too long from being but halffilled with work
with which he had no sympathy and diversions that gave him no pleasure
none held sufficient hours for all that he wanted to put into it And in
this busy atmosphere where his own studies took so much of his time
and energy and where everybody else was in some way similarly employed
that dismal selfconsciousness which so drearily looked on himself
shuffling along through fruitless uncongenial days was cracking off him
as the chestnut husk cracks when the kernel within swells and ripens

Apart from his work the centre of his life was certainly the household
of the Falbes where the brother and sister lived with their mother She
turned out to be in a rather remote manner one of us and had about
her very faint and dim like an antique lavender bag the odour of
Ashbridge She lived like the lilies of the field without toiling or
spinning either literally or with the more figurative work of the mind
indeed she can scarcely be said to have had any mind at all for as
with drugs she had sapped it away by a practically unremitting perusal
of all the fiction that makes the average reader wonder why it was
written In fact she supplied the answer to that perplexing question
since it was clearly written for her She was not in the least excited
by these tales any more than the human race are excited by the oxygen
in the air but she could not live without them She subscribed to three
lending libraries which by this time had probably learned her tastes
for if she ever by illchance embarked on a volume which ever so faintly
adumbrated the realities of life she instantly returned it as she
found it painful and naturally she did not wish to be pained This
did not however prevent her reading those that dealt with amiable
young men who fell in love with amiable young women and were for
the moment sundered by redhaired adventuresses or blackhaired
moneylenders for those she found not painful but powerful and could
often remember where she had got to in them which otherwise was not
usually the case She wore a good deal of lace spoke in a tired voice
and must certainly have been of the type called sweetly pretty some
quarter of a century ago She drank hot water with her meals and
continually reminded Michael of his own mother

Sylvia and Hermann certainly did all that could be done for her in
other words they invariably saw that her water was hot and her stock
of novels replenished But when that was accomplished there really
appeared to be little more that could be done for her Her presence in a
room counted for about as much as a rather powerful shadow on the wall
unexplained by any solid object which could have made it appear there
But most of the day she spent in her own room which was furnished
exactly in accordance with her twilight existence There was a
writingtable there which she never used several low armchairs one
of which she was always using by each of which was a small table on
to which she could put the book that she was at the moment engaged on
Lace hangings of the sort that prevent anybody either seeing in or out
obscured the windows and for decoration there were china figures on the
chimneypiece plushrimmed plates on the walls and a couple of easels
draped with chiffon on which stood enlarged photographs of her husband
and her children

There was it may be added nothing in the least pathetic about her
for as far as could be ascertained she had everything she wanted In
fact from the standpoint of commonsense hers was the most successful
existence for knowing what she liked she passed her entire life
in its accomplishment The only thing that caused her emotion was the
energy and vitality of her two children and even then that emotion was
but a mild surprise when she recollected how tremendous a worker and
boisterous a gourmand of life was her late husband on the anniversary
of whose death she always sat all day without reading any novels at all
but devoted what was left of her mind to the contemplation of nothing
at all She had married him because for some inscrutable reason he
insisted on it and she had been resigned to his death as to everything
else that had ever happened to her

All her life in fact she had been of that unchangeable drab quality
in emotional affairs which is characteristic of advanced middleage
when there are no great joys or sorrows to look back on and no
expectation for the future She had always had something of the
indestructible quality of frail things like thistledown or cottonwool
violence and explosion that would blow strong and distinct organisms
to atoms only puffed her a yard or two away where she alighted again
without shock instead of injuring or annihilating her    Yet in
the inexplicable ways of love Sylvia and her brother not only did what
could be done for her but regarded her with the tenderest affection
What that love lived on what was its daily food would be hard to guess
were it not that love lives on itself

The rest of the house apart from the vacuum of Mrs Falbes rooms
conducted itself so it seemed to Michael at the highest possible
pressure Sylvia and her brother were both far too busy to be restless
and if on the one hand Mrs Falbes remote impenetrable life was
inexplicable not less inexplicable was the rage for living that
possessed the other two From morning till night and on Sundays from
night till morning life proceeded at top speed

As regards household arrangements which were all in Sylvias hands
there were three fixed points in the day That is to say that there
was lunch for Mrs Falbe and anybody else who happened to be there at
halfpast one tea in Mrs Falbes wellliked sittingroom at five
and dinner at eight These mealsMrs Falbe always breakfasted in her
bedroomwere served with quiet decorum Apart from them anybody who
required anything consulted the cook personally Hermann for instance
would have spent the morning at his piano in the vast studio at the back
of their house in Maidstone Crescent and not arrived at the fact that
it was lunch time till perhaps three in the afternoon Unless then he
settled to do without lunch altogether he must forage for himself or
Sylvia having to sing at a concert at eight would return famished and
exultant about ten she would then proceed to provide herself unless
she supped elsewhere with a plate of eggs and bacon or anything
else that was easily accessible It was not from preference that these
haphazard methods were adopted but since they only kept two servants
it was clear that a couple of women however willing could not possibly
cope with so irregular a commissariat in addition to the series of fixed
hours and the rest of the household work As it was two splendidly
efficient persons one German the other English had filled the
posts of parlourmaid and cook for the last eight years and regarded
themselves and were regarded as members of the family Lucas
the parlourmaid indeed from the intense interest she took in the
conversation at table could not always resist joining in it and was
apt to correct Hermann or his sister if she detected an inaccuracy in
their statements No Miss Sylvia she would say it was on Thursday
not Wednesday and then recollecting herself would add Beg your
pardon miss

In this milieu as new to Michael as some suddenly discovered country
he found himself at once plunged and treated with instant friendly
intimacy Hermann so he supposed must have given him a good character
for he was made welcome before he could have had time to make any
impression for himself as Hermanns friend On the first occasion of
his visiting the house for the purpose of his music lesson he had
stopped to lunch afterwards where he met Sylvia and was in the
presence of you could hardly call it more than that their mother

Mrs Falbe had faded away in some mistlike fashion soon after but it
was evident that he was intended to do no such thing and they had gone
into the studio already comrades and Michael had chiefly listened
while the other two had violent and friendly discussions on every
subject under the sun Then Hermann happened to sit down at the piano
and played a Chopin etude pianissimo prestissimo with fingertips that
just made the notes to sound and no more and Sylvia told him that he
was getting it better and then Sylvia sang Who is Sylvia and Hermann
told her that she shouldnt have eaten so much lunch or shouldnt have
sung and then by transitions that Michael could not recollect they
played the Hailstone Chorus out of Israel in Egypt or at any rate
reproduced the spirit of it and both sang at the top of their voices
Then as usually happened in the afternoon two or three friends dropped
in and though these were all intimate with their hosts Michael had no
impression of being out in the cold or among strangers And when he left
he felt as if he had been stretching out chilly hands to the fire and
that the fire was always burning there ready for him to heat himself
at with its welcoming flames and core of sincere warmth whenever he
felt so disposed

At first he had let himself do this much less often than he would have
liked for the shyness of years his oversensitive modesty at his own
want of charm and lightness was a selferected barrier in his way He
was in spite of his intimacy with Hermann desperately afraid of being
tiresome of checking by his presence as he had so often felt himself
do before the ease and high spirits of others But by degrees this
broke down he realised that he was now among those with whom he had
that kinship of the mind and of tastes which makes the foundation on
which friendship and whatever friendship may ripen into is securely
built Never did the simplicity and sincerity of their welcome fail
the cordiality which greeted him was always his he felt that it was
intended that he should be at home there just as much as he cared to be

The six working days of the week however were as a rule too full both
for the Falbes and for Michael to do more than have apart from the
music lessons flying glimpses of each other for the day was taken up
with work concerts and opera occurred often in the evening and the
shuttles of London took their threads in divergent directions But on
Sunday the house at Maidstone Crescent ceased as Hermann said to be a
junction and became a temporary terminus

We burst from our chrysalis in fact he said If you find it
clearer to understand this way we burst from our chrysalis and become
a caterpillar Do chrysalides become caterpillars We do anyhow If
you come about eight you will find food if you come later you will also
find food of a sketchier kind People have a habit of dropping in on
Sunday evening Theres music if anyone feels inclined to make any and
if they dont they are made to Some people come early others late
and they stop to breakfast if they wish Its a gaudeamus you know a
jolly a jamboree One has to relax sometimes

Michael felt all his old unfitness for dreadful crowds return to him

Oh Im so bad at that sort of thing he said I am a frightful
killjoy Hermann

Hermann sat down on the treble part of his piano

Thats the most conceited thing Ive heard you say yet he remarked
Nobody will pay any attention to you you wont kill anybodys joy
Also its rather rude of you

I didnt mean to be rude said Michael

Then we must suppose you were rude by accident That is the worst sort
of rudeness

Im sorry Ill come said Michael

Thats right You might even find yourself enjoying it by accident you
know If you dont you can go away Theres music Sylvia sings quite
seriously sometimes and other people sing or bring violins and those
who dont like it talkand then we get less serious Have a try
Michael See if you cant be less serious too

Michael slipped despairingly from his seat

If only I knew how he said I believe my nurse never taught me to
play only to remember that I was a little gentleman All the same when
I am with you or with my cousin Francis I can manage it to a certain
extent

Falbe looked at him encouragingly

Oh youre getting on he said You take yourself more for granted
than you used to I remember you when you used to be polite on purpose
Its doing things on purpose that makes one serious If you ever play
the fool on purpose you instantly cease playing the fool

Is that it said Michael

Yes of course So come on Sunday and forget all about it except
coming And now do you mind going away I want to put in a couple of
hours before lunch You know what to practise till Tuesday dont you

That was the first Sunday evening that Michael had spent with his
friends after that up till this present date in November he had not
missed a single one of those gatherings They consisted almost entirely
of men and of the men there were many types and many ages Actors and
artists musicians and authors were indiscriminately mingled it was the
strangest conglomeration of diverse interests But one interest so it
seemed to Michael bound them all together they were all doing in their
different lives the things they most delighted in doing There was the
key that unlocked all the locksnamely the enjoyment that inspired
their work The freemasonry of art and the freemasonry of the eager mind
that looks out without verdict but with only expectation and delight in
experiment passed like an open secret among them secret because none
spoke of it open because it was so transparently obvious And since
this was so every member of that heterogeneous community had a respect
for his companions the fact that they were there together showed that
they had all passed this initiation and knew what for them life meant

Very soon after dinner all sitting accommodation other than the floor
was occupied but then the floor held the later comers and the
smoke from many cigarettes and the babble of many voices made a
constantlyascending incense before the altar dedicated to the gods that
inspire all enjoyable endeavour Then Sylvia sang and both those who
cared to hear exquisite singing and those who did not were alike silent
for this was a prayer to the gods they all worshipped and Falbe played
and there was a quartet of strings

After that less serious affairs held the rooms an eminent actor was
pleased to parody another eminent actor who was also present This led
to a scene in which each caricatured the other and a French poet did
gymnastic feats on the floor and upset a tray of sodawater and a
German conductor fluffed out his hair and died like Marguerite And when
in the earlier hours of the morning part of the guests had gone away
and part were broiling ham in the kitchen Sylvia sang again quite
seriously and Michael in Hermanns absence volunteered to play her
accompaniment for her She stood behind him and by a finger on his
shoulder directed him in the way she would have him go Michael found
himself suddenly and inexplicably understanding this her finger by its
pressure or its light tapping seemed to him to speak in a language that
he found himself familiar with and he slowed down stroking the notes
or quickened with staccato touch as she wordlessly directed him

Out of all these things which were but trivialities pleasant
unthinking hours for all else concerned several points stood out for
Michael points new and illuminating The first was the simplicity of it
all the spontaneousness with which pleasure was born if only you took
off your clothes so to speak and left them on the bank while you
jumped in All his life he had buttoned his jacket and crammed his hat
on to his head The second was the sense indefinable but certain that
Hermann and Sylvia between them were the high priests of this memorable
orgie

He himself had met at dreadful solemn evenings when Lady Ashbridge and
his father stood at the head of the stairs the two eminent actors who
had romped tonight and found them exceedingly stately personages just
as no doubt they had found him an icy and awkward young man But they
like him had taken their note on those different occasions from their
environment Perhaps if his father and mother came here    but
Michaels imagination quailed before such a supposition

The third point which gradually through these weeks began to haunt him
more and more was the personality of Sylvia He had never come across
a girl who in the least resembled her probably because he had not
attempted even to find in a girl or to display in himself the signals
winked across from one to the other of human companionship Always
he had found a difficulty in talking to a girl because he had in his
selfconsciousness thought about what he should say There had been the
cabalistic question of sex ever in front of him a thing that troubled
and deterred him But Sylvia with her hand on his shoulder absorbed in
her singing and directing him only as she would have pressed the pedal
of the piano if she had been playing to herself was no more agitating
than if she had been a man she was just singing just using him to help
her singing And even while Michael registered to himself this charming
annihilation of sex which allowed her to be to him no more than her
brother wasless in fact but on the same planeshe had come to
the end of her song patted him on the back as she would have patted
anybody else with a word of thanks and for him suddenly leaped into
significance It was not only a singer who had sung but an individual
one called Sylvia Falbe She took her place at present a most
inconspicuous one on the backcloth before which Michaels life was
acted towards which when no action so to speak was taking place
his eyes naturally turned themselves His father and mother were there
Francis also and Aunt Barbara and of course larger than the rest
Hermann Now Sylvia was discernible and as the days went by and
their meetings multiplied she became bigger walked into a nearer
perspective It did not occur to Michael rightly to imagine himself at
all in love with her for he was not Only she had asserted herself on
his consciousness

Not yet had she begun to trouble him and there was no sign either
external or intimate in his mind that he was sickening with the
splendid malady Indeed the significance she held for him was rather
that though she was a girl she presented none of the embarrassments
which that sex had always held for him She grew in comradeship he
found himself as much at ease with her as with her brother and her
charm was just that which had so quickly and strongly attracted Michael
to Hermann She was vivid in the same way as he was she had the same
warm welcoming kindlinessthe same complete absence of pose You knew
where you were with her and hitherto when Michael was with one of the
young ladies brought down to Ashbridge to be looked at he only wished
that wherever he was he was somewhere else But with Sylvia he had none
of this selfconsciousness she was bonne camarade for him in exactly
the same way as she was bonne camarade to the rest of the multitude
which thronged the Sunday evenings perfectly at ease with them as they
with her in relationship entirely unsentimental

But through these weeks up to this foggy November afternoon Michaels
most conscious preoccupation was his music Falbes principles in
teaching were entirely heretical according to the traditional school
he gave Michael no scale to play no dismal fingerexercise to fill the
hours

What is the good of them he asked They can only give you nimbleness
and strength Well you shall acquire your nimbleness and strength by
playing what is worth playing Take good music take Chopin or Bach or
Beethoven and practise one particular etude or fugue or sonata you may
choose anything you like and learn your nimbleness and strength that
way Read too read for a couple of hours every day The written
language of music must become so familiar to you that it is to you
precisely what a book or a newspaper is so that whether you read it
aloudwhich is playingor sit in your armchair with your feet on the
fender reading it not aloud on the piano but to yourself it conveys
its definite meaning to you At your lessons you will have to read aloud
to me But when you are reading to yourself never pass over a bar that
you dont understand It has got to sound in your head just as the
words you read in a printed book really sound in your head if you read
carefully and listen for them You know exactly what they would be like
if you said them aloud Can you read by the way Have a try

Falbe got down a volume of Bach and opened it at random

There he said begin at the top of the page

But I cant said Michael I shall have to spell it out

Thats just what you mustnt do Go ahead and dont pause till you get
to the bottom of the page Count start each bar when it comes to its
turn and play as many notes as you can in it

This was a dismal experience Michael hitherto had gone on the
painstaking and thorough plan of spelling out his notes with laborious
care Now Falbes inexorable voice counted for him until it was lost in
inextinguishable laughter

Go on go on he shouted I thought it was Bach and it is clearly
Strausss Don Quixote

Michael flushed and determined with grave set mouth ploughed his way
through amazing dissonances and at the end joined Falbes laughter

Oh dear he said Very funny But dont laugh so at me Hermann

Falbe dried his eyes

And what was it he said I declare it was the fourth fugue An
entirely different conception of it A thoroughly original view Now
what youve got to do is to repeat thatnot the same murder I mean
but other murdersfor a couple of hours a day    By degreesyou
wont believe ityou will find you are not murdering any longer but
only mortally wounding After six months I dare say you wont even be
hurting your victims All the same you can begin with less muscular
ones

In this way Michaels musical horizons were infinitely extended Not
only did this system of Falbes of flying at new music and going
recklessly and regardlessly on give quickness to his brain and finger
make his wits alert to pick up the new language he was learning but
it gloriously extended his vision and his range of country He ran
joyfully though with a thousand falls and tumbles through these new
and wonderful vistas he worshipped at the grave Gothic sanctuaries of
Beethoven he roamed through the enchanted garden of Chopin he felt the
icy and eternal frosts of Russia and saw in the northern sky the great
auroras spread themselves in spear and sword of fire he listened to the
wisdom of Brahms and passed through the noble and smiling country
of Bach All this so to speak was holiday travel and between his
journeys he applied himself with the same eager industry to the learning
of his art so that he might reproduce for himself and others true
pictures of the scenes through which he scampered Here Falbe was not so
easily moved to laughter he was as severe with Michael as he was with
himself when it was the question of learning some piece with a view
to really playing it There was no lighthearted hurrying on through
blurred runs and false notes slurred phrases and incomplete chords
Among these pieces which had to be properly learned was the 17th Prelude
of Chopin on hearing which at Baireuth on the tuneless and catarrhed
piano Falbe had agreed to take Michael as a pupil But when it was
played again on Falbes great Steinway as a professed performance a
very different standard was required

Falbe stopped him at the end of the first two lines

This wont do Michael he said You played it before for me to see
whether you could play You can But it wont do to sketch it Every
note has got to be there Chopin didnt write them by accident He knew
quite well what he was about Begin again please

This time Michael got not quite so far when he was stopped again He
was playing without notes and Falbe got up from his chair where he had
the book open and put it on the piano

Do you find difficulty in memorising he asked

This was discouraging Michael believed that he remembered easily he
also believed that he had long known this by heart

No I thought I knew it he said

Try again

This time Falbe stood by him and suddenly put his finger down into the
middle of Michaels hands striking a note

You left out that F sharp he said Go on    Now you are leaving
out that E natural Try to get it better by Thursday and remember this
that playing and all that differentiates playing from strumming only
begins when you can play all the notes that are put down for you to
play without fail Youre beginning at the wrong end you have admirable
feeling about that prelude but you neednt think about feeling till
youve got all the notes at your fingers ends Then and not till then
you may begin to remember that you want to be a pianist Now whats the
next thing

Michael felt somewhat squashed and discouraged He had thought he had
really worked successfully at the thing he knew so well by sight His
heavy eyebrows drew together

You told me to harmonise that Christmas carol he remarked rather
shortly

Falbe put his hand on his shoulder

Look here Michael he said youre vexed with me Now theres
nothing to be vexed at You know quite well you were leaving out lots of
notes from those jolly fat chords and that you werent playing cleanly
Now Im taking you seriously and I wont have from you anything but
the best you can do Youre not doing your best when you dont even play
what is written You cant begin to work at this till you do that

Michael had a moments severe tussle with his temper He felt vexed and
disappointed that Hermann should have sent him back like a schoolboy
with his exercise torn over Not immediately did he confess to himself
that he was completely in the wrong

Im doing the best I can he said Its rather discouraging

He moved his big shoulders slightly as if to indicate that Hermanns
hand was not wanted there Hermann kept it there

It might be discouraging he said if you were doing your best

Michaels illtemper oozed from him

Im wrong he said turning round with the smile that made his ugly
face so pleasant And Im sorry both that I have been slack and that
Ive been sulky Will that do

Falbe laughed

Very well indeed he said Now for Good King Wenceslas Wasnt
it

Yes I got awfully interested over it Hermann I thought I would try
and work it up into a few variations

Lets hear said Falbe

This was a vastly different affair Michael had shown both ingenuity and
a great sense of harmonic beauty in the arrangement of the very simple
little tune that Falbe had made him exercise his ear over and the
halfdozen variations that followed showed a wonderfully mature
handling The air which he dealt with haunted them as a sort of unseen
presence It moved in a tiny gavotte or looked on at a minuet measure
it wailed yet without being positively heard in a little dirge of
itself it broadened into a march it shouted in a bravura of rapid
octaves and finally asserted itself heard once more over a great
scale base of bells

Falbe as was his habit when interested sat absolutely still but
receptive and alert instead of jerking and fidgeting as he had done
over Michaels fiasco in the Chopin prelude and at the end he jumped up
with a certain excitement

Do you know what youve done he said Youve done something thats
really good Faults Yes millions but theres a firstrate imagination
at the bottom of it How did it happen

Michael flushed with pleasure

Oh they sang themselves he said and I learned them But will it
really do Is there anything in it

Yes old boy theres King Wenceslas in it and youve dressed him up
well Play that last one again

The last one was taxing to the fingers but Michaels big hands banged
out the octave scale in the bass with wonderful ease and Falbe gave a
great guffaw of pleasure at the rollicking conclusion

Write them all down he said and try if you can hear it singing half
a dozen more If you can write them down also and give me leave to
play the lot at my concert in January

Michael gasped

You dont mean that he said

Certainly I do Its a fine bit of stuff

It was with these variations now on the point of completion that
Michael meant to spend his solitary and rapturous evening The spirits
of the airwhatever those melodious sprites may behad for the last
month made themselves very audible to him and the halfdozen further
variations that Hermann had demanded had rung all day in his head Now
as they neared completion he found that they ceased their singing
their work of dictation was done he had to this extent expressed
himself and they haunted him no longer At present he had but jotted
down the skeleton of bars that could be filled in afterwards and it
gave him enormous pleasure to see the roles reversed and himself out of
his own brain setting Falbe his task

But he felt much more than this He had done something Michael the
dumb awkward Michael was somehow revealed on those eight pages of
music All his twentyfive years he had stood wistfully inarticulate
unable so it had seemed to him to show himself to let himself out
And not till now when he had found this means of access did he know
how passionately he had desired it nor how immensely in the process
of so doing his desire had grown He must find out more ways other
channels of projecting himself The need for that as of a diver
throwing himself into the empty air and the laughing waters below him
suddenly took hold of him

He took a clean sheet of music paper into which he placed his pages
and with a pleasurable sense of pomp wrote in the centre of it

 VARIATIONS ON AN AIR

Dedicated to Sylvia Falbe he wrote at the top


CHAPTER VII


Michael had been so engrossingly employed since his return to London in
the autumn that the existence of other ties and other people apart from
those immediately connected with his work had worn a very shadowlike
aspect He had it is true written with some regularity to his mother
finding somewhat to his dismay how very slight the common ground
between them was for purposes of correspondence He could outline the
facts that he had been to several concerts that he had seen much of
his musicmaster that he had been diligent at his work but he realised
that there was nothing in detail about those things that could possibly
interest her and that nothing except them really interested him She
on her side had little to say except to record the welfare of Petsy to
remark on the beauty of October and tell him how many shooting parties
they had had

His correspondence with his father had been less frequent and
absolutely onesided since Lord Ashbridge took no notice at all of his
letters Michael regretted this as showing that he was still outcast
but it cannot be said to have come between him and the sunshine for he
had begun to manufacture the sunshine within that internal happiness
which his environment and way of life produced which seemed to be
independent of all that was not directly connected with it But a letter
which he received next morning from his mother stated in addition to
the fact that Petsy had another of her tiresome bilious attacks poor
lamb that his father and she thought it right that he should come down
to Ashbridge for Christmas It conveyed the sense that at this joyful
season a truce probably limited in duration and even while it lasted
of the nature of a stronglyarmed neutrality was proclaimed but the
prospect was not wholly encouraging for Lady Ashbridge added that
she hoped Michael would not go on vexing his father What precisely
Michael was expected to do in order to fulfil that wish was not further
stated but he wrote dutifully enough to say that he would come down at
Christmas

But the letter rekindled his dormant sense of there being other people
in the world beside his immediate circle also indefinably it gave
him the sense that his mother wanted him That should be so then and
sequentially he remembered with a pang of selfreproach that he had not
as much as indicated his presence in London to Aunt Barbara or set eyes
on her since their meeting in August He knew she was in London since
he had seen her name in some paragraph in the papers not long before
and instantly wrote to ask her to dine with him at a near date Her
answer was characteristic

Of course Ill dine with you my dear she wrote it will be
delightful And what has happened to you Your letter actually conveyed
a sense of cordiality You never used to be cordial And I wish to meet
some of your nice friends Ask one or two pleasea prima donna of some
kind and a pianist I think I want them weird and originalthe prima
donna with short hair and the pianist with long In Tonys new station
in life I never see anybody except the sort of people whom your father
likes Are you forgiven yet by the way

Michael found himself on the grin at the thought of Aunt Barbara
suddenly encountering the two magnificent Falbes prima donna and
pianist exactly as she had desired as representing the weird sort of
people whom she pictured his living among and the result quite came
up to his expectations As usual Aunt Barbara was late and came in
talking rapidly about the various causes that had detained her which
her fruitful imagination had suggested to her as she dressed In order
perhaps to suit herself to the circle in which she would pass the
evening she had put on or rather it looked as if her maid had thrown
at her a very awful sort of teagown brown and pricklylooking and
adapted to Bohemian circles She with the same lively imagination had
pictured Michael in a velveteen coat and soft shirt the pianist as very
small with spectacles and long hair and the prima donna a fullblown
kind of barmaid with Roman pearls   

Yes my dear I know I am late she began before she was inside the
door but Og had so much to say and there was a block at Hyde Park
Corner My dear Michael how smart you look

She came round the corner of the screen and the Falbes burst upon her
Hermann and Sylvia standing by the fire For the short spectacled
pianist there was this very tall Englishlooking young man upright and
soldierly with his handsome boyish face and wellfitting clothes That
was bad enough but infinitely worse was she who was to have been the
fullblown barmaid Instead was this magnificent girl nearly as tall as
her brother with her small oval face crowning the column of her neck
her eyes merry her mouth laughing at some brotherly retort that Hermann
had just made Aunt Barbara took her in with one seconds surveyher
face her neck her beautiful dress her whole air of ease and
goodbreeding and gave a despairing glance at her own prickly teagown
For the moment amiably accustomed as she was to laugh at herself she
did not find it humourous

Miss Sylvia Falbe Aunt Barbara said Michael with a little tremor
in his voice and Mr Hermann Falbe Lady Barbara Jerome he added
rather as if he expected nobody to believe it

Aunt Barbara made the best of it shook hands in her jolly manner and
burst into laughter

Michael I could slay you she said but before I do that I must tell
your friends all about it This horrible nephew of mine Miss Falbe
promised me two weird musicians and I expectedI really cant tell you
what I expectedbut there were to be spectacles and velveteen coats and
the general air of an afternoon concert at Clapham Junction But it is
nice to be made such a fool of I feel precisely like an elderly and
sour governess who has been ordered to come down to dinner so that
there shant be thirteen Give me your arm Mr Falbe and take me in
to dinner at once where I may drown my embarrassment in soup Or does
Michael go in first Go on wretch

Presently they were seated at dinner and Aunt Barbara could not help
enlarging a little on her own discomfiture

It is all your fault Michael she said You have been in London all
these weeks without letting me know anything about you or your friends
or what you were doing so naturally I supposed you were leading some
obscure kind of existence Instead of which I find this sort of thing
My dear what good soup I shall see if I cant induce your cook to
leave you But bachelors always have the best of everything Now tell
me about your visit to Germany Which was the point where we
partedBaireuth wasnt it I would not go to Baireuth with anybody

I went with Mr Falbe said Michael

Ah Mr Falbe has not asked me yet I may have to revise what I say
said Aunt Barbara daringly

I didnt ask Michael said Hermann I got into his carriage as the
train was moving and my luggage was left behind

I was left behind said Sylvia which was worse But I sent Hermanns
luggage

So expeditiously that it arrived the day before we left for Munich
remarked Hermann

And thats all the gratitude I get But in the interval you lived upon
Lord Comber

I do still in the money I earn by giving him music lessons Mike have
you finished the Variations yet

Variationswhat are Variations asked Aunt Barbara

Yes two days ago Variations are all the things you think about on the
piano Aunt Barbara when you are playing a tune made by somebody else

Should I like them Will Mr Falbe play them to me asked she

I daresay he will if he can But I thought you loathed music

It certainly depends on who makes it said Aunt Barbara I dont like
ordinary music because the person who made it doesnt matter to me
But if so to speak it sounds like somebody I know it is a different
matter

Michael turned to Sylvia

I want to ask your leave for something I have already done he said

And if I dont give it you

Then I shant tell you what it is

Sylvia looked at him with her candid friendly eyes Her brother always
told her that she never looked at anybody except her friends if she was
engaged in conversation with a man she did not like she looked at his
shirtstud or at a point slightly above his head

Then of course I give in she said I must give you leave if
otherwise I shant know what you have done But its a mean trick Tell
me at once

Ive dedicated the Variations to you he said

Sylvia flushed with pleasure

Oh but thats absolutely darling of you she said Have you really
Do you mean it

If youll allow me

Allow you Hermann the Variations are mine Isnt it too lovely

It was at this moment that Aunt Barbara happened to glance at Michael
and it suddenly struck her that it was a perfectly new Michael whom she
looked at She knew and was secretly amused at the fiasco that always
attended the introduction of amiable young ladies to Ashbridge and had
warned her sisterinlaw that Michael when he chose the girl he wanted
would certainly do it on his own initiative Now she felt sure that
Michael though he might not be aware of it himself was even if he had
not chosen beginning to choose There was that in his eyes which
none of the importations to Ashbridge had ever seen there that eager
deferential attention which shows that a young man is interested
because it is a girl he is talking to That she knew had never been
characteristic of Michael indeed it would not have been far from the
truth to say that the fact that he was talking to a girl was sufficient
to make his countenance wear an expression of polite boredom Then for a
while as dinner progressed she doubted the validity of her conclusion
for the Michael who was entertaining her tonight was wholly different
from the Michael she had known and liked and pitied She felt that she
did not know this new one yet but she was certain that she liked him
and equally sure that she did not pity him at all He had found his
place he had found his work he evidently fitted into his life which
after all is the surest ground of happiness and it might be that it
was only general joy so to speak that kindled that pleasant fire in
his face And then once more she went back to her first conclusion for
talking to Michael herself she saw as a woman so infallibly sees that
he gave her but the most superficial attentionsufficient indeed to
allow him to answer intelligently and laugh at the proper places but
his mind was not in the least occupied with her If Sylvia moved his
glance flickered across in her direction it was she who gave him his
alertness Aunt Barbara felt that she could have told him truthfully
that he was in love with her and she rather thought that it would be
news to him probably he did not know it yet himself And she wondered
what his father would say when he knew it

And then Munich she said violently recalling Michaels attention
towards her Munich I could have borne better than Baireuth and when
Mr Falbe asks me there I shall probably go Your Uncle Tony was in
Germany then by the way he went over at the invitation of the Emperor
to the manoeuvres

Did he The Emperor came to Munich for a day during them He was at the
opera said Michael

You didnt speak to him I suppose she asked

Yes he sent for me and talked a lot In fact he talked too much
because I didnt hear a note of the second act

Aunt Barbara became infinitely more interested

Tell me all about it Michael she said What did he talk about

Everything as far as I can remember England Ashbridge armies
navies music Hermann says he cast pearls before swine

And his tone his attitude she asked

Towards ustowards England Immensely friendly and most inquisitive
I was never asked so many questions in so short a time

Aunt Barbara suddenly turned to Falbe

And you she asked Were you with Michael

No Lady Barbara I had no pearls

And are you naturalised English she asked

No I am German

She slid swiftly off the topic

Do you wonder I ask with your talking English so perfectly she said
You should hear me talking French when we are entertaining Ambassadors
and that sort of persons I talk it so fast that nobody can understand a
word I say That is a defensive measure you must observe because even
if I talked it quite slowly they would understand just as little But
they think it is the pace that stupefies them and they leave me in a
curious dazed condition And now Miss Falbe and I are going to leave
you two Be rather a long time dear Michael so that Mr Falbe can tell
you what he thinks of me and his sister shall tell me what she thinks
of you Afterwards you and I will tell each other if it is not too
fearful

This did not express quite accurately Lady Barbaras intentions for she
chiefly wanted to find out what she thought of Sylvia

And you are great friends you three she said as they settled
themselves for the prolonged absence of the two men

Sylvia smiled she smiled Aunt Barbara noticed almost entirely with
her eyes using her mouth only when it came to laughing but her eyes
smiled quite charmingly

Thats always rather a rash thing to pronounce on she said I can
tell you for certain that Hermann and I are both very fond of him but
it is presumptuous for us to say that he is equally devoted to us

My dear there is no call for modesty about it said Barbara Between
youfor I imagine it is you who have done itbetween you you have made
a perfectly different creature of the boy Youve made him flower

Sylvia became quite grave

Oh I do hope he likes us she said He is so likable himself

Barbara nodded

And youve had the good sense to find that out she said Its
astonishing how few people knew it But then as I said Michael hadnt
flowered No one understood him or was interested Then he suddenly
made up his mind last summer what he wanted to do and be and
immediately did and was it

I think he told Hermann said she His father didnt approve did
he

Approve My dear if you knew my brother you would know that the only
things he approves of are those which Michael isnt

Sylvia spread her fine hands out to the blaze warming them and shading
her face

Michael always seems to us she began Ah I called him Michael by
mistake

Then do it on purpose next time remarked Barbara What does Michael
seem

Ah but dont let him know I called him Michael said Sylvia in some
horror There is nothing so awful as to speak of people formally to
their faces and intimately behind their backs But Hermann is always
talking of him as Michael

And Michael always seems

Oh yes he always seems to me to have been part of us of Hermann and
me for years Hes THERE if you know what I mean and so few people
are there They walk about your life and go in and out so to speak
but Michael stops I suppose its because he is so natural

Aunt Barbara had been a diplomatist long before her husband and fearful
of appearing inquisitive about Sylvias impression of Michael which she
really wanted to inquire into instantly changed the subject

Ah everybody who has got definite things to do is natural she said
It is only the idle people who have leisure to look at themselves in
the glass and pose And I feel sure that you have definite things to do
and plenty of them my dear What are they

Oh I sing a little said Sylvia

That is the first unnatural thing you have said I somehow feel that
you sing a great deal

Aunt Barbara suddenly got up

My dear you are not THE Miss Falbe are you who drove London crazy
with delight last summer Dont tell me you are THE Miss Falbe

Sylvia laughed

Do you know Im afraid I must be she said Isnt it dreadful to
have to say that after your description

Aunt Barbara sat down again in a sort of calm despair

If there are any more shocks coming for me tonight she said I
think I had better go home I have encountered a perfectly new nephew
Michael I have dressed myself like a suburban housekeeper to meet a
Poiret so dont deny it and having humourously told Michael I wished
to see a prima donna and a pianist he takes me at my word and produces
THE Miss Falbe Im glad I knew that in time I should infallibly have
asked you to sing and if you had done soyou are probably goodnatured
enough to have done even thatI should have given the drawingroom
gasp at the end and told your brother that I thought you sang very
prettily

Sylvia laughed

But really it wasnt my fault Lady Barbara she said When we met I
couldnt have said Beware I am THE Miss Falbe

No my dear but I think you ought somehow to have conveyed the
impression that you were a tremendous swell You didnt I have been
thinking of you as a charming girl and nothing more

But thats quite good enough for me said Sylvia

The two young men joined them after this and Hermann speedily became
engrossed in reading the finished Variations Some of these pleased him
mightily one he altogether demurred to

Its just a crib Mike he said The critics would say I had
forgotten it and put in instead what I could remember of a variation
out of the Handel theme That next ones oh great fun But I wish
you would remember that we all havent got great orangoutang paws like
you

Aunt Barbara stopped in the middle of her sentence she knew Michaels
old sensitiveness about these physical disabilities and she had a
moments cold horror at the thought of Falbe having said so miserably
tactless a thing to him But the horror was of infinitesimal duration
for she heard Michaels laugh as they leaned over the top of the piano
together

I wish you had Hermann he said I know youll bungle those tenths

Falbe moved to the pianoseat

Oh lets have a shot at it he said If Lady Barbara wont mind
play that one through to me first Mike

Oh presently Hermann he said It makes such an infernal row that
you cant hear anything else afterwards Do sing Miss Sylvia my aunt
wont really mindwill you Aunt Barbara

Michael I have just learned that this is THE Miss Falbe she said I
am suffering from shock Do let me suffer from coals of fire too

Michael gently edged Hermann away from the musicstool Much as he
enjoyed his masters accompaniment he was perfectly sure that he
preferred if possible to play for Sylvia himself than have the
pleasure of listening to anybody else

And may I play for you Miss Sylvia he asked

Yes will you Thanks Lord Comber

Hermann moved away

And so Mr Hermann sits down by Lady Barbara while Lord Comber plays
for Miss Sylvia he observed with emphasis on the titles

A sudden amazing boldness seized Michael

Sylvia then he said

All right Michael answered the girl laughing

She came and stood on the left of the piano slightly behind him

And what are we going to have asked Michael

It must be something we both know for Ive brought no music said
she

Michael began playing the introduction to the Hugo Wolff song which
he had accompanied for her one Sunday night at their house He knew it
perfectly by heart but stumbled a little over the difficult syncopated
time This was not done without purpose for the next moment he felt her
hand on his shoulder marking it for him

Yes thats right she said Now youve got it And Michael smiled
sweetly at his own amazing ingenuity

Hermann put down the Variations which he still had in his hand when
Sylvias voice began Unaccustomed as she was to her accompanist his
trained ear told him that she was singing perfectly at ease and was
completely at home with her player Occasionally she gave Michael some
little indication as she had done before but for the most part her
fingers rested immobile on his shoulder and he seemed to understand
her perfectly Somehow this was a surprise to him he had not known that
Michael possessed that sort of secondsight that unerringly feels and
translates into the keys the singers mood For himself he always had to
attend most closely when he was playing for his sister but familiar as
he was with her singing he felt that Michael divined her certainly as
well as himself and he listened to the piano more than to the voice

You extraordinary creature he said when the song was over Where did
you learn to accompany

Suddenly Michael felt an access of shyness as if he had been surprised
when he thought himself private

Oh Ive played it before for MissI mean for Sylvia he said

Then he turned to the girl

Thanks awfully he said And Im greedy May we have one more

He slid into the opening bars of Who is Sylvia That song since
he had heard her sing it at her recital in the summer had grown in
significance to him even as she had It had seemed part of her then
but then she was a stranger Tonight it was even more intimately part
of her and she was a friend

Hermann strolled across to the fireplace at the end of this and lit a
cigarette

My sisters a blatant egoist Lady Barbara he said She loves
singing about herself And she lays it on pretty thick too doesnt
she Now Sylvia if youve finishedquite finished I meando come
and sit down and let me try these Variations

Shall we surrender Michael asked the girl Or shall we stick to the
piano now weve got it If Hermann once sits down you know we shant
get him away for the rest of the evening I cant sing any more but we
might play a duet to keep him out

Hermann rushed to the piano took his sister by the shoulders and
pushed her into a chair

You sit there he said and listen to something not about yourself
Michael if you dont come away from that piano I shall take Sylvia
home at once Now you may all talk as much as you like you wont
interrupt me one atombut youll have to talk loud in certain parts

Then a feat of marvellous execution began Michael had taken an evil
pleasure in giving his master for whom he slaved with so unwearied a
diligence something that should tax his powers and he gave a great
crash of laughter when for a moment Hermann was brought to a complete
standstill in an octave passage of triplets against quavers and the
performer exultantly joined in it as he pushed his hair back from his
forehead and made a second attempt

It isnt decent to ask a fellow to read that he shouted Its a
crime its a scandal

My dear nobody asked you to read it said Sylvia

Silence you chit Mike come here a minute Sit down one second and
play that Promise to get up again though immediately Just these
three barsyes I see An orangoutang apparently can do it so why
not I Am I not much better than they Go away please or rather stop
there and turn over Why couldnt you have finished the page with the
last act and started this one fresh instead of making this Godforsaken
arrangement Now

A very simple little minuet measure followed this outrageous passage
and Hermanns exquisite lightness of touch made it sound strangely
remote as if from a mile away or a hundred years ago some graceful
echo was evoked again Then the little dirge wept for the memories
of something that had never happened and leaving out the number he
disapproved of as reminiscent of the Handel theme Hermann gathered
himself up again for the assertion of the original tune with its bars
of scale octaves The contagious jollity of it all seized the others
and Sylvia with full voice and Aunt Barbara in a strange hooting
sang to it

Then Hermann banged out the last chord and jumped up from his seat
rolling up the music

I go straight home he said and have a peaceful hour with it
Michael old boy how did you do it Youve been studying seriously for
a few months only and so this must all have been in you before And
youve come to the age you are without letting any of it out I suppose
thats why it has come with a rush You knew it all along while you
were wasting your time over drilling your toy soldiers Come on Sylvia
or I shall go without you Good night Lady Barbara Halfpast ten
tomorrow Michael

Protest was clearly useless and having seen the two off Michael came
upstairs again to Aunt Barbara who had no intention of going away just
yet

And so these are the people you have been living with she said No
wonder you had not time to come and see me Do they always go that sort
of paceit is quicker than when I talk French

Michael sank into a chair

Oh yes thats Hermann all over he said Butbut just think what
it means to me Hes going to play my tunes at his concert Michael
Comber Op 1 O Lord O Lord

And you just met him in the train said Aunt Barbara

Yes second class Victoria Station with Sylvia on the platform I
didnt much notice Sylvia then

This and the inference that naturally followed was as much as could be
expected and Aunt Barbara did not appear to wait for anything more on
the subject of Sylvia She had seen sufficient of the situation to
know where Michael was most certainly bound for Yet the very fact of
Sylvias outspoken friendliness with him made her wonder a little as to
what his reception would be She would hardly have said so plainly that
she and her brother were devoted to him if she had been devoted to him
with that secret tenderness which in its essentials is reticent about
itself Her halfhours conversation with the girl had given her a
certain insight into her still more had her attitude when she stood by
Michael as he played for her and put her hand on his shoulder precisely
as she would have done if it had been another girl who was seated at the
piano Without doubt Michael had a real existence for her but there
was no sign whatever that she hailed it as a girl so unmistakably does
when she sees it as part of herself

More about them she said What are they Who are they

He outlined for her giving the halfEnglish halfGerman parentage the
shadowlike mother the Bavarian father Sylvias sudden and cometlike
rising in the musical heaven while her brother seven years her senior
had spent his time in earning in order to give her the chance which she
had so brilliantly taken Now it was to be his turn the shackles of his
drudgery no longer impeded him and he so Michael radiantly prophesied
was to have his rocketlike leap to the zenith also

And hes German she asked

Yes Wasnt he rude about my being a toy soldier But thats the
natural German point of view I suppose

Michael strolled to the fireplace

Hermanns so funny he said For days and weeks together you would
think he was entirely English and then a word slips from him like that
which shows he is entirely German He was like that in Munich when the
Emperor appeared and sent for me

Aunt Barbara drew her chair a little nearer the fire and sat up

I want to hear about that she said

But Ive told you he was tremendously friendly in a national manner

And that seemed to you real she asked

Michael considered

I dont know that it did he said It all seemed to me rather
feverish I think

And he asked quantities of questions I think you said

Hundreds He was just like what he was when he came to Ashbridge He
reviewed the Yeomanry and shot pheasants and spent the afternoon in a
steam launch apparently studying the deepwater channel of the river
where it goes underneath my fathers place and then in the evening
there was a concert

Aunt Barbara did not heed the concert

Do you mean the channel up from Harwich she asked of which the
Admiralty have the secret chart

I fancy they have said Michael And then after the concert there was
the torchlight procession with the bonfire on the top of the hill

I wasnt there What else

I think thats all said Michael But what are you driving at Aunt
Barbara

She was silent a moment

Im driving at this she said The Germans are accumulating a vast
quantity of knowledge about England Tony for instance has a German
valet and when he went down to Portsmouth the other day to see the
American ship that was there he took him with him And the man took a
camera and was found photographing where no photography is allowed Did
you see anything of a camera when the Emperor came to Ashbridge

Michael thought

Yes one of his staff was clicking away all day he said He sent a
lot of them to my mother

And we may presume kept some copies himself remarked Aunt Barbara
drily Really for childish simplicity the English are the biggest
fools in creation

But do you mean

I mean that the Germans are a very knowledgeseeking people and that
we gratify their desires in a very simple fashion Do you think they are
so friendly Michael Do you know for instance what is a very common
toast in German regimental messes They do not drink it when there are
foreigners there but one night during the manoeuvres an officer in
a mess where Tony was dining got slightly on as you may say and
suddenly drank to Der Tag

That means The Day said Michael confidently

It does and what day The day when Germany thinks that all is ripe
for a war with us Der Tag will dawn suddenly from a quiet peaceful
night when they think we are all asleep and when they have got all the
information they think is accessible War my dear

Michael had never in his life seen his aunt so serious and he was
amazed at her gravity

There are hundreds and hundreds of their spies all over England she
said and hundreds of their agents all over America Deep patient
Germany as Carlyle said Shes as patient as God and as deep as the
sea They are working working while our toy soldiers play golf I
agree with that adorable pianist and whats more I believe they think
that Der Tag is near to dawn Tony says that their manoeuvres this
year were like nothing that has ever been seen before Germany is a
fighting machine without parallel in the history of the world

She got up and stood with Michael near the fireplace

And they think their opportunity is at hand she said though not
for a moment do they relax their preparations We are their real enemy
dont you see They can fight France with one hand and Russia with the
other and in a few months time now they expect we shall be in the
throes of an internal revolution over this Irish business They may be
right but there is just the possibility that they may be astoundingly
wrong The fact of the great foreign perilthis nightmare this
Armageddon of European warmay be exactly that which will pull us
together But their diplomatists anyhow are studying the Irish
question very closely and German gold without any doubt at all is
helping the Home Rule party As a nation we are fast asleep I wonder
what we shall be like when we wake Shall we find ourselves already
fettered when we wake or will there be one moment just one moment in
which we can spring up At any rate hitherto the English have always
been at their best not their worst in desperate positions They hate
exciting themselves and refuse to do it until the crisis is actually on
them But then they become disconcertingly serious and coolheaded

And you think the Emperor began Michael

I think the Emperor is the hardest worker in all Germany said
Barbara I believe he is trying and admirably succeeding to make us
trust his professions of friendship He has a great eye for detail too
it seemed to him worth while to assure you even my dear Michael of his
regard and affection for England He was always impressing on Tony the
same thing though to him of course he said that if there was any
country nearer to his heart than England it was America Stuff and
nonsense my dear

All this though struck in a more serious key than was usual with Aunt
Barbara was quite characteristic of her She had the quality of mind
which when occupied with one idea is occupied with it to the exclusion
of all others she worked at full power over anything she took up But
now she dismissed it altogether

You see what a diplomatist I have become she said It is a
fascinating business one lives in an atmosphere that is charged with
secret affairs and it infects one like the influenza You catch it
somehow and have a feverish cold of your own And I am quite useful to
him You see I am such a chatterbox that people think I let out things
by accident which I never do I let out what I want to let out on
purpose and they think they are pumping me I had a long conversation
the other day with one of the German Embassy all about Irish affairs
They are hugely interested about Irish affairs and I just make a note
of that but they can make as many notes as they please about what
I say and no one will be any the wiser In fact they will be the
foolisher And now I suppose I had better take myself away

Dont do anything of the kind said Michael

But I must And if when you are down at Ashbridge at Christmas you
find strangers hanging about the deepwater reach you might just let me
know Its no use telling your father because he will certainly think
they have come to get a glimpse of him as he plays golf But I expect
youll be too busy thinking about that new friend of yours and perhaps
his sister What did she tell me we had got to do To her garlands let
us bring was it not You and I will both send wreaths Michael though
not for her funeral Now dont be a hermit any more but come and see
me You shall take your garland girl into dinner if she will come
too and her brother shall certainly sit next me I am so glad you have
become yourself at last Go on being yourself more and more my dear it
suits you


CHAPTER VIII


Some fortnight later and not long before Michael was leaving town for
his Christmas visit to Ashbridge Sylvia and her brother were lingering
in the big studio from which the last of their Sunday evening guests had
just departed The usual joyous chaos consequent on those entertainments
reigned the top of the piano was covered with the plates and glasses of
those who had made an alfresco supper or breakfast of fried bacon and
beer before leaving a circle of cushions were ranged on the floor round
the fire for it was a bitterly cold night and since for some reason
a series of charades had been spontaneously generated there was lying
about an astonishing collection of pillowcases rugs and tablecloths
and such articles of domestic and household use as could be converted
into clothes for this purpose But the event of the evening had
undoubtedly been Hermanns performance of the Wenceslas Variations
these he had now learned and as he had promised Michael was going
to play them at his concert in the Steinway Hall in January Tonight
a good many musician friends had attended the Sunday evening gathering
and there had been no two opinions about the success of them

I was talking to Arthur Lagden about them said Falbe naming a
prominent critic of the day and he would hardly believe that they were
an Opus I or that Michael had not been studying music technically for
years instead of six months But thats the odd thing about Mike hes
so mature

It was not unusual for the brother and sister to sit up like this till
any hour after their guests had gone and Sylvia collected a bundle
of cushions and lay full length on the floor with her feet towards the
fire For both of them the week was too busy on six days for them to
indulge that companionship sometimes full of talk sometimes consisting
of those dropped words and long silences on which intimacy lives
and they both enjoyed above all hours in the week this time that lay
between the friendly riot of Sunday evening and the starting of work
again on Monday There was between them that bond which can scarcely
exist between husband and wife since it almost necessarily implies the
close consanguinity of brother and sister and postulates a certain sort
of essential community of nature founded not on tastes nor even on
affection but on the fact that the same blood beats in the two Here
an intense affection too strong to be ever demonstrative fortified
it and both brother and sister talked to each other as if they were
speaking to some physically independent piece of themselves

Sylvia had nothing apparently to add on the subject of Michaels
maturity Instead she just raised her head which was not quite high
enough

Stuff another cushion under my head Hermann she said Thanks now
Im completely comfortable you will be relieved to hear

Hermann gazed at the fire in silence

Thats a weight off my mind he said About Michael now Hes been
suppressed all his life you know and instead of being dwarfed he has
just gone on growing inside Good Lord I wish somebody would suppress
me for a year or two What a lot there would be when I took the cork out
again We dissipate too much Sylvia both you and I

She gave a little grunt which from his knowledge of her inarticulate
expressions he took to mean dissent

I suppose you mean we dont he remarked

Yes How much one dissipates is determined for one just as is the shape
of your nose or the colour of your eyes By the way I fell madly in
love with that cousin of Michaels who came with him tonight Hes
the most attractive creature I ever saw in my life Of course hes too
beautiful no boy ought to be as beautiful as that

You flirted with him remarked Hermann Mike will probably murder him
on the way home

Sylvia moved her feet a little farther from the blaze

Funny she asked

Instantly Falbe knew that her mind was occupied with exactly the same
question as his

No not funny at all he said Quite serious Do you want to talk
about it or not

She gave a little groan

No I dont want to but Ive got to she said Aunt Barbarawe
became Sylvia and Aunt Barbara an hour or two ago and shes a
dearAunt Barbara has been talking to me about it already

And what did Aunt Barbara say

Just what you are going to said Sylvia namely that I had better
make up my mind what I mean to say when Michael says what he means to
say

She shifted round so as to face her brother as he stood in front of the
fire and pulled his trouserleg more neatly over the top of his shoe

But whats to happen if I cant make up my mind she said I neednt
tell you how much I like Michael I believe I like him as much as I
possibly can But I dont know if that is enough Hermann is it enough
You ought to know Theres no use in you unless you know about me

She put out her arm and clasped his two legs in the crook of her
elbow That expressed their attitude what they were to each other as
absolutely as any physical demonstration allowed Had there not been the
difference of sex which severed them she could never have got the sense
of support that this physical contact gave her had there not been her
sisterhood to chaperon her so to speak she could never have been so
at ease with a man The two were loverlike without the physical
apexes and limitations that physical love must always bring with it
The complement of sex that brought them so close annihilated the very
existence of sex They loved as only brother and sister can love
without trouble

The closer contact of his firewarmed trousers to the calf of his leg
made Hermann step out of her encircling arm without any question of
hurting her feelings

I wont be burned he said Sorry but I wont be burned It seems
to me Sylvia that you ought to like Michael a little more and a little
less

Its no use saying what I ought to do she said The idea of what I
ought doesnt come in I like him just as much as I like him neither
more nor less

He clawed some more cushions together and sat down on the floor by
her She raised herself a little and rested her body against his folded
knees

Whats the trouble Sylvia he said

Just what Ive been trying to tell you

Be more concrete then Youre definite enough when you sing

She sighed and gave a little melancholy laugh

Thats just it she said People like you and me and Michael too
for that matter are most entirely ourselves when we are at our music
When Michael plays for me I can sing my soul at him While he and I are
in music if you understandand of course you dowe belong to each
other Do you know Hermann he finds me when Im singing without the
slightest effort and even you as you have so often told me have
to search and be on the lookout And then the song is over and as
somebody says When the feast is finished and the lamps expire
thenwell the lamps expire and he isnt me any longer but Michael
with thethe ugly face andoh isnt it horrible of methe long arms
and the little stumpy legsif only he was rather different in things
that dont matter that CANT matter Butbut Hermann if only Michael
was rather like you and you like Michael I should love you exactly as
much as ever and I should love Michael too

She was leaning forward and with both hands was very carefully tying
and untying one of Hermanns shoelaces

Oh thank goodness there is somebody in the world to whom I can say
just whatever I feel and know he understands she said And I know
this tooand follow me here HermannI know that all that doesnt
really matter I am sure it doesnt I like Michael far too well to let
it matter But there are other things which I dont see my way through
and they are much more real

She was silent again so long that Hermann reached out for a cigarette
lit it and threw away the match before she spoke

There is Michaels position she said When Michael asks me if I
will have him as we both know he is going to do I shall have to make
conditions I wont give up my career I must go on workingin other
words singingwhether I marry him or not I dont call it singing in
my sense of the word to sing The Banks of Allan Water to Michael
and his father and mother at Ashbridge any more than it is being a
politician to read the morning papers and argue about the Irish question
with you To have a career in politics means that you must be a member
of ParliamentI daresay the House of Lords would doand make speeches
and stand the racket In the same way to be a singer doesnt mean to
sing after dinner or to go squawking anyhow in a workhouse but it means
to get up on a platform before critical people and if you dont do your
very best be damned by them If I marry Michael I must go on singing
as a professional singer and not become an amateurthe Viscountess
Comber who sings so charmingly I refuse to sing charmingly I will
either sing properly or not at all And I couldnt not sing I shall
have to continue being Miss Falbe so to speak

You say you insist on it said Hermann but whether you did or not
there is nothing more certain than that Michael would

I am sure he would But by so doing he would certainly quarrel
irrevocably with his people Even Aunt Barbara who after all is very
liberally minded sees that They can none of them not even she who
are born to a certain tradition imagine that there are other traditions
quite as stiffnecked Michael it is true was born to one tradition
but he has got the other as he has shown very clearly by refusing to
disobey it He will certainly as you say insist on my endorsing the
resolution he has made for himself What it comes to is this that I
cant marry him without his fathers complete consent to all that I have
told you I cant have my career disregarded covered up with awkward
silences alluded to as a painful subject and as I say even Aunt
Barbara seemed to take it for granted that if I became Lady Comber I
should cease to be Miss Falbe Well there shes wrong my dear I shall
continue to be Miss Falbe whether Im Lady Comber or Lady Ashbridge
or the Duchess of anything you please Andhere the difficulty really
comes inthey must all see how right I am Difficulty did I say Its
more like an impossibility

Hermann threw the end of his cigarette into the ashes of the dying fire

Its clear then he said you have made up your mind not to marry
him

She shook her head

Oh Hermann you fail me she said If I had made up my mind not to I
shouldnt have kept you up an hour talking about it

He stretched his hands out towards the embers already coated with grey
ash

Then its like that with you he said pointing If there is the fire
in you it is covered up with ashes

She did not reply for a moment

I think youve hit it there she said I believe there is the fire
when as I said he plays for me I know there is But the ashes What
are they And who shall disperse them for me

She stood up swiftly drawing herself to her full height and stretching
her arms out

Theres something bigger than we know coming she said Whether its
storm or sunshine I have no idea But there will be something that shall
utterly sever Michael and me or utterly unite us

Do you care which it is he asked

Yes I care said she

He held out his hands to her and she pulled him up to his feet

What are you going to say then when he asks you he said

Tell him he must wait

He went round the room putting out the electric lamps and opening the
big skylight in the roof There was a curtain in front of this which he
pulled aside and from the frosty cloudless heavens the starshine of a
thousand constellations filtered down

Thats a lot to ask of any man he said If you care you care

And if you were a girl you would know exactly what I mean she said
They may know they care but unless they are marrying for perfectly
different reasons they have to feel to the end of their fingers that
they care before they can say Yes

He opened the door for her to pass out and they walked up the passage
together arminarm

Well perhaps Michael wont ask you he said in which case all
bother will be saved and we shall have sat up talking tillSylvia did
you know it is nearly threesat up talking for nothing

Sylvia considered this

Fiddlesticks she said

And Hermann was inclined to agree with her


This view of the case found confirmation next day for Michael after
his music lesson lingered so firmly and determinedly when the three
chatted together over the fire that in the end Hermann found nothing
to do but to leave them together Sylvia had given him no sign as to
whether she wished him to absent himself or not and he concluded
since she did not put an end to things by going away herself that she
intended Michael to have his say

The latter rose as the door closed behind Hermann and came and stood
in front of her And at the moment Sylvia could notice nothing of him
except his heaviness his plainness all the things that she had told
herself before did not really matter Now her sensation contradicted
that she was conscious that the ash somehow had vastly accumulated
over her fire that all her affection and regard for him were suddenly
eclipsed This was a complete surprise to her for the moment she found
Michaels presence and his proximity to her simply distasteful

I thought Hermann was never going he said

For a second or two she did not reply it was clearly no use to continue
the ordinary banter of conversation to suggest that as the room was
Hermanns he might conceivably be conceded the right to stop there if he
chose There was no transition possible between the affairs of every day
and the affair for which Michael had stopped to speak She gave up all
attempt to make one instead she just helped him

What is it Michael she asked

Then to her at any rate Michaels face completely changed There
burned in it all of a sudden the full glow of that of which she had only
seen glimpses

You know he said

His shyness his awkwardness had all vanished the time had come for
him to offer to her all that he had to offer and he did it with the
charm of perfect manliness and simplicity

Whether you can accept me or not he said I have just to tell you
that I am entirely yours Is there any chance for me Sylvia

He stood quite still making no movement towards her She on her side
found all her distaste of him suddenly vanished in the mere solemnity of
the occasion His very quietness told her better than any protestations
could have done of the quality of what he offered and that quality
vastly transcended all that she had known or guessed of him

I dont know Michael she said at length

She came a step forward and without any sense of embarrassment
found that she without conscious intention had put her hands on his
shoulders The moment that was done she was conscious of the impulse
that made her do it It expressed what she felt

Yes I feel like that to you she said Youre a dear I expect you
know how fond I am of you and if you dont I assure you of it now But
I have got to give you more than that

Michael looked up at her

Yes Sylvia he said much more than that

A few minutes ago only she had not liked him at all now she liked him
immensely

But how Michael she asked How can I find it

Oh its I who have got to find it for you he said That is to say
if you want it to be found Do you

She looked at him gravely without the tremor of a smile in her eyes

What does that mean exactly she said

It is very simple Do you want to love me

She did not move her hands they still rested on his shoulders like
things at ease like things at home

Yes I suppose I want to she said

And is that the most you can do for me at present he asked

That reached her again all the time the plain words the plain face
the quiet of him stabbed her with daggers of which he had no idea
She was dismayed at the recollection of her talk with her brother the
evening before of the ease and certitude with which she had laid down
her conditions of not giving up her career of remaining the famous
Miss Falbe of refusing to take a dishonoured place in the sacred
circle of the Combers Now when she was face to face with his love so
ineloquently expressed so radically a part of him she knew that there
was nothing in the world external to him and her that could enter into
their reckonings but into their reckonings there had not entered the
one thing essential She gave him sympathy liking friendliness but
she did not want him with her blood And though it was not humanly
possible that she could want him with more than that it was not
possible that she could take him with less

Yes that is the most I can do for you at present she said

Still quite quietly he moved away from her so that he stood free of her
hands

I have been constantly here all these last months he said Now that
you know what I have told you do you want not to see me

That stabbed her again

Have I implied that she asked

Not directly But I can easily understand its being a bore to you I
dont want to bore you That would be a very stupid way of trying to
make you care for me As I said that is my job I havent accomplished
it as yet But I mean to I only ask you for a hint

She understood her own feeling better than he She understood at least
that she was dealing with things that were necessarily incalculable

I cant give you a hint she said I cant make any plans about it
If you were a woman perhaps you would understand Love is or it isnt
That is all I know about it

But Michael persisted

I only know what you have taught me he said But you must know
that

In a flash she became aware that it would be impossible for her to
behave to Michael as she had behaved to him for several months past
She could not any longer put a hand on his shoulder beat time with her
fingers on his arm knowing that the physical contact meant nothing to
her and allall to him The rejection of him as a lover rendered the
sisterly attitude impossible And not only must she revise her conduct
but she must revise the mental attitude of which it was the physical
counterpart Up till this moment she had looked at the situation from
her own side only had felt that no plans could be made that the
natural thing was to go on as before with the intimacy that she liked
and the familiarity that was the obvious expression of it But now she
began to see the question from his side she could not go on doing
that which meant nothing particular to her if that insouciance meant
something so very particular to him She realised that if she had loved
him the touch of his hand the proximity of his face would have had
significance for her a significance that would have been intolerable
unless there was something mutual and secret between them It had seemed
so easy in anticipation to tell him that he must wait so simple
for him justwell just to wait until she could make up her mind She
believed as she had told her brother that she cared for Michael or
as she had told him that she wanted tothe two were to the girls
mind identical though expressed to each in the only terms that were
possiblebut until she came face to face with the picture of the
future that to her wore the same outline and colour as the past she
had not known the impossibility of such a presentment The desire of the
lover on Michaels part rendered unthinkable the sisterly attitude on
hers That her instinct told her but her reason revolted against it

Cant we go on as we were Michael she said

He looked at her incredulously

Oh no of course not that he said

She moved a step towards him

I cant think of you in any other way she said as if making an
appeal

He stood absolutely unresponsive Something within him longed that she
should advance a step more that he should again have the touch of her
hands on his shoulders but another instinct stronger than that made him
revoke his desire and if she had moved again he would certainly have
fallen back before her

It may seem ridiculous to you he said since you do not care But I
cant do that Does that seem absurd to you I I am afraid it does but
that is because you dont understand By all means let us be what they
call excellent friends But there are certain little things which seem
nothing to you and they mean so much to me I cant explain its just
the brotherly relation which I cant stand Its no use suggesting that
we should be as we were before

She understood well enough for his purposes

I see she said

Michael paused for a moment

I think Ill be going now he said I am off to Ashbridge in two
days Give Hermann my love and a jolly Christmas to you both Ill let
you know when I am back in town

She had no reply to this she saw its justice and acquiesced

Goodbye then said Michael


He walked home from Chelsea in that utterly blank and unfeeling
consciousness which almost invariably is the sequel of any event that
brings with it a change of attitude towards life generally Not for a
moment did he tell himself that he had been awakened from a dream or
abandon his conviction that his dream was to be made real The rare
quiet determination that had made him give up his stereotyped mode of
life in the summer and take to music was still completely his and if
anything it had been reinforced by Sylvias emphatic statement that
she wanted to care Only her imagining that their old relations could
go on showed him how far she was from knowing what to care meant At
first without knowing it but with a gradually increasing keenness of
consciousness he had become aware that this sisterly attitude of hers
towards him had meant so infinitely much because he had taken it to be
the prelude to something more Now he saw that it was so to speak a
piece complete in itself It bore no relation to what he had imagined
it would lead into No curtain went up when the prelude was over the
curtain remained inexorably hanging there not acknowledging the prelude
at all Not for a moment did he accuse her of encouraging him to have
thought so she had but given him a frankness of comradeship that meant
to her exactly what it expressed But he had thought otherwise he had
imagined that it would grow towards a culmination All that and here
was the change that made his mind blank and unfeeling had to be cut
away and with it all the budding branches that his imagination had
pictured as springing from it He could not be comrade to her as he was
to her brotherthe inexorable demands of sex forbade it

He went briskly enough through the clean dry streets The frost of last
night had held throughout the morning and the sunlight sparkled with
a rare and seasonable brightness of a traditional Christmas weather
Hecatombs of turkeys hung in the poulterers windows among sprigs of
holly and shops were bright with childrens toys The briskness of
the day had flushed the colour into the faces of the passengers in the
street and the festive air of the imminent holiday was abroad All this
Michael noticed with a sense of detachment what had happened had caused
a veil to fall between himself and external things it was as if he was
sealed into some glass cage and had no contact with what passed round
him This lasted throughout his walk and when he let himself into his
flat it was with the same sense of alienation that he found his cousin
Francis gracefully reclining on the sofa that he had pulled up in front
of the fire

Francis was inclined to be querulous

I was just wondering whether I should give you up he said The hour
that you named for lunch was halfpast one And I have almost forgotten
what your clock sounded like when it struck two

This also seemed to matter very little

Did I ask you to lunch he said I really quite forgot I cant even
remember doing it now

But there will be lunch asked Francis rather anxiously

Of course Itll be ready in ten minutes

Michael came and stood in front of the fire and looked with a sudden
spasm of envy on the handsome boy who lay there If he himself had been
anything like that

I was distinctly chippy this morning remarked Francis and so I
didnt so much mind waiting for lunch I attribute it to too much beer
and bacon last night at your friends house I enjoyed itI mean the
evening and for that matter the baconat the time It really was
extremely pleasant

He yawned largely and openly

I had no idea you could frolic like that Mike he said It was quite
a new light on your character How did you learn to do it Its quite a
new accomplishment

Here again the veil was drawn Was it last night only that Falbe
had played the Variations and that they had acted charades Francis
proceeded in bland unconsciousness

I didnt know Germans could be so jolly he continued As a rule
I dont like Germans When they try to be jolly they generally only
succeed in being topheavy But of course your friend is halfEnglish
Cant he play too And to think of your having written those ripping
tunes His sister toono wonder we havent seen much of you Mike if
thats where youve been spending your time Shes rather like the new
girl at the Gaiety but handsomer I like big girls dont you Oh I
forgot you dont like girls much anyhow But are you learning your
mistake Mike You looked last night as if you were getting more
sensible

Michael moved away impatiently

Oh shut it Francis he observed

Francis raised himself on his elbow

Why whats up he asked Wont she turn a favourable eye

Michael wheeled round savagely

Please remember you are talking about a lady and not a Gaiety lady
he remarked

This brought Francis to his feet

Sorry he said I was only indulging in badinage until lunch was
ready

Michael could not make up his mind to tell his cousin what had happened
but he was aware of having spoken more strongly than the situation as
Francis knew of it justified

Lets have lunch then he said We shall be better after lunch as
ones nurse used to say And are you coming to Ashbridge Francis

Yes Ive been talking to Aunt Bar about it this morning Were both
coming the family is going to rally round you Mike and defend you
from Uncle Robert Theres sure to be some duck shooting too isnt
there

This was a considerable relief to Michael

Oh thats ripping he said You and Aunt Barbara always make me feel
that theres a good deal of amusement to be extracted from the world

To be sure there is Isnt that what the world is for Lunch and
amusement and dinner and amusement Aunt Bar told me she dined with you
the other night and had a quantity of amusement as well as an excellent
dinner She hinted

Oh Aunt Barbaras always hinting said Michael

I know After all everything that isnt hints is obvious and so
theres nothing to say about it Tell me more about the Falbes Mike
Will they let me go there again do you think Was I popular Dont tell
me if I wasnt

Michael smiled at this egoism that could not help being charming

Would you care if you werent he asked

Very much One naturally wants to please delightful people And I think
they are both delightful Especially the girl but then she starts with
the tremendous advantage of beingof being a girl I believe you are in
love with her Mike just as I am Its that which makes you so grumpy
But then you never do fall in love Its a pity you miss a lot of jolly
trouble

Michael felt a sudden overwhelming desire to make Francis stop this
maddening twaddle also the events of the morning were beginning to take
on an air of reality and as this grew he felt the need of sympathy of
some kind Francis might not be able to give him anything that was
of any use but it would do no harm to see if his cousins buoyant
unconscious philosophy which made life so exciting and pleasant a thing
to him would in any way help Besides he must stop this light banter
which was like drawing plaster off a sore and unhealed wound

Youre quite right he said I am in love with her Furthermore I
asked her to marry me this morning

This certainly had an effect

Good Lord said Francis And do you mean to say she refused you

She didnt accept me said Michael Wewe adjourned

But why on earth didnt she take you asked Francis

All Michaels old sensitiveness his selfconsciousness of his
plainness his awkwardness his big hands his short legs came back to
him

I should think you could see well enough if you look at me he said
without my telling you

Oh that silly old rot said Francis cheerfully I thought you had
forgotten all about it

I almost hadin fact I quite had until this morning said Michael
If I had remembered it I shouldnt have asked her

He corrected himself

No I dont think thats true he said I should have asked her
anyhow but I should have been prepared for her not to take me As a
matter of fact I wasnt

Francis turned sideways to the table throwing one leg over the other

Thats nonsense he said It doesnt matter whether a mans ugly or
not

It doesnt as long as he is not remarked Michael grimly

It doesnt matter much in any case Were all ugly compared to girls
and why ever they should consent to marry any of us awful hairy things
smelling of smoke and drink is more than I can make out but as a
matter of fact they do They dont mind what we look like what they
care about is whether we want them Of course there are exceptions

You see one said Michael

No I dont Good Lord youve only asked her once Youve got to make
yourself felt Youre not intending to give up are you

I couldnt give up

Well then just hold on She likes you doesnt she

Certainly said Michael without hesitation But thats a long way
from the other thing

Its on the same road

Michael got up

It may be he said but it strikes me its round the corner You
cant even see one from the other

Possibly not But you never know how near the corner really is Go for
her Mike full speed ahead

But how

Oh there are hundreds of ways Im not sure that one of the best isnt
to keep away for a bit Even if she doesnt want you just now when
you are there she may get to want you when you arent I dont think I
should go on the mournful Byronic plan if I were you I dont think it
would suit your style youre too heavily built to stand leaning against
the chimneypiece gazing at her and dishevelling your hair

Michael could not help laughing

Oh for Gods sake dont make a joke of it he said

Why not It isnt a tragedy yet It wont be a tragedy till she marries
somebody else or definitely says no And until a thing is proved to be
tragic the best way to deal with it is to treat it like a comedy
which is going to end well Its only the second act now you see when
everything gets into a mess By the merciful decrees of Providence you
see girls on the whole want us as much as we want them Thats what
makes it all so jolly


Michael went down next day to Ashbridge where Aunt Barbara and Francis
were to follow the day after and found after the freedom and
interests of the last six months that the pompous formal life was more
intolerable than ever He was clearly in disgrace still as was made
quite clear to him by his fathers icy and awful politeness when it
was necessary to speak to him and by his utter unconsciousness of his
presence when it was not This he had expected Christmas had ushered
in a truce in which no guns were discharged but remained sighted and
pointed ready to fire

But though there was no change in his father his mother seemed to
Michael to be curiously altered her mind which as has been already
noticed was usually in a stunned condition seemed to have awakened
like a child from its sleep and to have begun vaguely crying in an
inarticulate discomfort It was true that Petsy was no more having
succumbed to a bilious attack of unusual severity but a second Petsy
had already taken her place and Lady Ashbridge sat with himit was a
gentleman Petsy this timein her lap as before and occasionally shed
a tear or two over Petsy II in memory of Petsy I But this did not seem
to account for the wakening up of her mind and emotions into this
state of depression and anxiety It was as if all her life she had been
quietly dozing in the sun and that the place where she sat had passed
into the shade and she had awoke cold and shivering from a bitter
wind She had become far more talkative and though she had by no
means abandoned her habit of upsetting any conversation by the extreme
obviousness of her remarks she asked many more questions and as
Michael noticed often repeated a question to which she had received an
answer only a few minutes before During dinner Michael constantly found
her looking at him in a shy and eager manner removing her gaze when she
found it was observed and when later after a silent cigarette with
his father in the smokingroom during which Lord Ashbridge with some
ostentation studied an Army List Michael went to his bedroom he was
utterly astonished when he gave a Come in to a tapping at his door
to see his mother enter Her maid was standing behind her holding the
inevitable Petsy and she herself hovered hesitatingly in the doorway

I heard you come up Michael she said and I wondered if it would
annoy you if I came in to have a little talk with you But I wont come
in if it would annoy you I only thought I should like a little chat
with you quietly secure from interruptions

Michael instantly got up from the chair in front of his fire in which
he had already begun to see images of Sylvia This intrusion of his
mothers was a thing utterly unprecedented and somehow he at once
connected its innovation with the strange manner he had remarked
already But there was complete cordiality in his welcome and he
wheeled up a chair for her

But by all means come in mother he said I was not going to bed
yet

Lady Ashbridge looked round for her maid

And will Petsy not annoy you if he sits quietly on my knee she asked

Of course not

Lady Ashbridge took the dog

There that is nice she said I told them to see you had a good fire
on this cold night Has it been very cold in London

This question had already been asked and answered twice now for the
third time Michael admitted the severity of the weather

I hope you wrap up well she said I should be sorry if you caught
cold and so I am sure your father would be I wish you could make up
your mind not to vex him any more but go back into the Guards

Im afraid thats impossible mother he said

Well if its impossible there is no use in saying anything more about
it But it vexed him very much He is still vexed with you I wish he
was not vexed It is a sad thing when father and son fall out But you
do wrap up I hope in the cold weather

Michael felt a sudden pang of anxiety and alarm Each separate thing
that his mother said was sensible enough but in the sum they were
nonsense

You have been in London since September she went on That is a long
time to be in London Tell me about your life there Do you work hard
Not too hard I hope

No hard enough to keep me busy he said

Tell me about it all I am afraid I have not been a very good mother to
you I have not entered into your life enough I want to do so now
But I dont think you ever wanted to confide in me It is sad when sons
dont confide in their mothers But I daresay it was my fault and now I
know so little about you

She paused a moment stroking her dogs ears which twitched under her
touch

I hope you are happy Michael she said I dont think I am so happy
as I used to be But dont tell your father I feel sure he does not
notice it and it would vex him But I want you to be happy you used
not to be when you were little you were always sensitive and queer But
you do seem happier now and thats a good thing

Here again this was all sensible when taken in bits but its aspect was
different when considered together She looked at Michael anxiously a
moment and then drew her chair closer to him laying her thin veined
hand sparkling with many rings on his knee

But it wasnt I who made you happier she said and thats so
dreadful I never made anybody happy Your father always made himself
happy and he liked being himself but I suspect you havent liked being
yourself poor Michael But now that youre living the life you chose
which vexes your father is it better with you

The shyness had gone from the gaze that he had seen her direct at him
at dinner which fugitively fluttered away when she saw that it was
observed and now that it was bent so unwaveringly on him he saw shining
through it what he had never seen before namely the motherlove
which he had missed all his life Now for the first time he saw it
recognising it as by divination when with ray serene and untroubled
it burst through the mists that seemed to hang about his mothers mind
Before noticing her change of manner her restless questions he had
been vaguely alarmed and as they went on the alarm had become
more pronounced but at this moment when there shone forth the
motherinstinct which had never come out or blossomed in her life but
had been overlaid completely with routine and conventionality rendering
it too indolent to put forth petals Michael had no thought but for that
which she had never given him yet and which now it began to expand
before him he knew he had missed all his life

She took up his big hand that lay on his knee and began timidly stroking
it

Since you have been away she said and since your father has been
vexed with you I have begun to see how lonely you must have been What
taught me that I am afraid was only that I have begun to feel lonely
too Nobody wants me even Petsy when she died didnt want me to be
near her and then it began to strike me that perhaps you might want me
There was no one else and who should want me if my son did not I never
gave you the chance before God forgive me and now perhaps it is too
late You have learned to do without me

That was bitterly true the truth of it stabbed Michael On his side
as he knew he had made no effort either or if he had they had been but
childish efforts easily repulsed He had not troubled about it and if
she was to blame the blame was his also She had been slow to show the
motherinstinct but he had been just as wanting in the tenderness of
the son

He was profoundly touched by this humble timidity by the sincerity
vague but unquestionable that lay behind it

Its never too late is it he said bending down and kissing the thin
white hands that held his We are in time after all arent we

She gave a little shiver

Oh dont kiss my hands Michael she said It hurts me that you
should do that But it is sweet of you to say that I am not too late
after all Michael may I just take you in my armsmay I

He half rose

Oh mother how can you ask he said

Then let me do it No my darling dont move Just sit still as you
are and let me just get my arms about you and put my head on your
shoulder and hold me close like that for a moment so that I can
realise that I am not too late

She got up and leaning over him held him so for a moment pressing
her cheek close to his and kissing him on the eyes and on the mouth

Ah that is nice she said It makes my loneliness fall away from me
I am not quite alone any more And now if you are not tired will you
let me talk to you a little more and learn a little more about you

She pulled her chair again nearer him so that sitting there she could
clasp his arm

I want your happiness dear she said but there is so little now
that I can do to secure it I must put that into other hands You are
twentyfive Michael you are old enough to get married All Combers
marry when they are twentyfive dont they Isnt there some girl you
would like to be yours But you must love her you know you must want
her you mustnt be able to do without her It wont do to marry just
because you are twentyfive

It would no more have entered into Michaels head this morning to tell
to his mother about Sylvia than to have discussed counterpoint with her
But then this morning he had not been really aware that he had a mother
But to tell her now was not unthinkable but inevitable

Yes there is a girl whom I cant do without he said

Lady Ashbridges face lit up

Ah tell me about hertell me about her she said You want her you
cant do without her that is the right wife for you

Michael caught at his mothers hand as it stroked his sleeve

But she is not sure that she can do with me he said

Her face was not dimmed at this

Oh you may be sure she doesnt know her own mind she said Girls so
often dont You must not be downhearted about it Who is she Tell me
about her

Shes the sister of my great friend Hermann Falbe he said who
teaches me music

This time the gladness faded from her

Oh my dear it will vex your father again she said that you should
want to marry the sister of a musicteacher It will never do to vex him
again Is she not a lady

Michael laughed

But certainly she is he said Her father was German her mother was
a Tracy just as wellborn as you or I

How odd then that her brother should have taken to giving music
lessons That does not sound good Perhaps they are poor and certainly
there is no disgrace in being poor And what is her name

Sylvia said Michael You have probably heard of her she is the Miss
Falbe who made such a sensation in London last season by her singing

The old outlook the old traditions were beginning to come to the
surface again in poor Lady Ashbridges mind

Oh my dear she said A singer That would vex your father terribly
Fancy the daughter of a Miss Tracy becoming a singer And yet you want
herthat seems to me to matter most of all

Then came a step at the door it opened an inch or two and Michael
heard his fathers voice

Is your mother with you Michael he asked

At that Lady Ashbridge got up For one second she clung to her son and
then disengaging herself froze up like the sudden congealment of a
spring

Yes Robert she said I was having a little talk to Michael

May I come in

Its our secret she whispered to Michael

Yes come in father he said

Lord Ashbridge stood towering in the doorway

Come my dear he said not unkindly its time for you to go to
bed

She had become the mask of herself again

Yes Robert she said I suppose it must be late I will come Oh
theres Petsy Will you ring Michael then Fedden will come and take
him to bed He sleeps with Fedden


CHAPTER IX


Michael in desperate conversational efforts next morning at breakfast
mentioned the fact that the German Emperor had engaged him in a
substantial talk at Munich and had recommended him to pass the winter
at Berlin It was immediately obvious that he rose in his fathers
estimation for though no doubt primarily the fact that Michael was
his son was the cause of this interest it gave Michael a sort of
testimonial also to his respectability If the Emperor had thought
that his taking up a musical career was indelibly disgracefulas Lord
Ashbridge himself had donehe would certainly not have made himself
so agreeable On anyone of Lord Ashbridges essential and deeprooted
snobbishness this could not fail to make a certain effect his chilly
politeness to Michael sensibly thawed you might almost have detected
a certain cordiality in his desire to learn as much as possible of this
gratifying occurrence

And you mean to go to Berlin he asked

Im afraid I shant be able to said Michael my master is in
London

I should be inclined to reconsider that Michael said the father
The Emperor knows what he is talking about on the subject of music

Lady Ashbridge looked up from the breakfast she was giving Petsy II
His dietary was rather less rich than that of the defunct and she was
afraid sometimes that his food was not nourishing enough

I remember the concert we had here she said We had the Song to
Aegir twice

Lord Ashbridge gave her a quick glance Michael felt he would not have
noticed it the evening before

Your memory is very good my dear he said with encouragement

And then we had a torchlight procession she remarked

Quite so You remember it perfectly And about his visit here Michael
Did he talk about that

Yes very warmly also about our international relations

Lord Ashbridge gave a little giggle

I must tell Barbara that he said She has become a sort of
Cassandra since she became a diplomatist and sits on her tripod and
prophesies woe

She asked me about it said Michael I dont think she believes in
his sincerity

He giggled again

Thats because I didnt ask her down for his visit he said

He rose

And what are you going to do my dear he said to his wife

She looked across to Michael

Perhaps Michael will come for a stroll with me she said

No doubt he will I shall have a round of golf I think on this fine
morning I should like to have a word with you Michael when youve
finished your breakfast

The moment he had gone her whole manner changed it was suffused with
the glow that had lit her last night

And we shall have another talk dear she said It was tiresome being
interrupted last night But your father was better pleased with you this
morning


Michaels understanding of the situation grew clearer Whatever was the
change in his mother whatever perhaps it portended it was certainly
accompanied by two symptoms the one the late dawning of motherlove for
himself the other a certain fear of her husband for all her married
life she had been completely dominated by him and had lived but in a
twilight of her own now into that twilight was beginning to steal
a dread of him His pleasure or his vexation had begun to affect her
emotionally instead of being as before merely recorded in her mind
as she might have recorded an object quite exterior to herself and seen
out of the window Now it was in the room with her Even as Michael
left her to speak with him the consciousness of him rose again in her
making her face anxious

And youll try not to vex him wont you she said

His father was in the smokingroom standing enormously in front of the
fire and for the first time the sense of his colossal fatuity struck
Michael

There are several things I want to tell you about he said Your
career first of all I take it that you have no intention of deferring
to my wishes on the subject

No father I am afraid not said Michael

I want you to understand then that though I shall not speak to
you again about it my wishes are no less strong than they were It is
something to me to know that a man whom I respect so much as the Emperor
doesnt feel as I do about it but that doesnt alter my view

I understand said Michael

The next is about your mother he said Do you notice any change in
her

Yes said Michael

Can you describe it at all

Michael hesitated

She shows quite a new affection for myself he said She came and
talked to me last night in a way she had never done before

The irritation which Michaels mere presence produced on his father
was beginning to make itself felt The fact that Michael was squat and
longarmed and ugly had always a sideblow to deal at Lord Ashbridge
in the reminder that he was his father He tried to disregard thishe
tried to bring his mind into an impartial attitude without seeing for
a moment the bitter irony of considering impartiality the ideal
quality when dealing with his son He tried to be fair and Michael was
perfectly conscious of the effort it cost him

I had noticed something of the sort he said Your mother was always
asking after you You have not been writing very regularly Michael We
know little about your life

I have written to my mother every week said Michael

The magical effects of the Emperors interest were dying out Lord
Ashbridge became more keenly aware of the disappointment that Michael
was to him

I have not been so fortunate then he said

Michael remembered his mothers anxious face but he could not let this
pass

No sir he said but you never answered any of my letters I thought
it quite probable that it displeased you to hear from me

I should have expressed my displeasure if I had felt it said his
father with all the pomposity that was natural to him

That had not occurred to me said Michael I am afraid I took your
silence to mean that my letters didnt interest you

He paused a moment and his rebellion against the whole of his fathers
attitude flared up

Besides I had nothing particular to say he said My life is passed
in the pursuit of which you entirely disapprove

He felt himself back in boyhood again with this stifling and leaden
atmosphere of authority and disapproval to breathe He knew that Francis
in his place would have done somehow differently he could almost
hear Aunt Barbara laughing at the pomposity of the situation that had
suddenly erected itself monstrously in front of him The fact that he
was Michael Comber vexed his fatherthere was no statement of the case
so succinctly true

Lord Ashbridge moved away towards the window turning his back
on Michael Even his back his homespun Norfolk jacket his loose
knickerbockers his stalwart calves expressed disapproval but when his
father spoke again he realised that he had moved away like that and
obscured his face for a different reason

Have you noticed anything else about your mother he asked

That made Michael understand

Yes father he said I daresay I am wrong about it

Naturally I may not agree with you but I should like to know what it
is

Shes afraid of you said Michael

Lord Ashbridge continued looking out of the window a little longer
letting his eyes dwell on his own garden and his own fields where
towered the leafless elms and the red roofs of the little town which
had given him his own name and continued to give him so satisfactory an
income There presented itself to his mind his own picture painted and
framed and glazed and hung up by himself the beneficent nobleman the
conscientious landlord the essential vertebra of Englands backbone It
was really impossible to impute blame to such a fine fellow He turned
round into the room again braced and refreshed and saw Michael thus

It is quite true what you say he said with a certain pride in his
own impartiality She has developed an extraordinary timidity towards
me I have continually noticed that she is nervous and agitated in my
presenceI am quite unable to account for it In fact there is no
accounting for it But I am thinking of going up to London before long
and making her see some good doctor A little tonic I daresay though I
dont suppose she has taken a dozen doses of medicine in as many years
I expect she will be glad to go up for she will be near you The one
delusionfor it is no less than thatis as strange as the other

He drew himself up to his full magnificent height

I do not mean that it is not very natural she should be devoted to her
son he said with a tremendous air

What he did mean was therefore uncertain and again he changed the
subject

There is a third thing he said This concerns you You are of the
age when we Combers usually marry I should wish you to marry Michael
During this last year your mother has asked half a dozen girls down
here all of whom she and I consider perfectly suitable and no doubt
you have met more in London I should like to know definitely if you
have considered the question and if you have not I ask you to set
about it at once

Michael was suddenly aware that never for a moment had Sylvia been away
from his mind Even when his mother was talking to him last night Sylvia
had sat at the back in the inmost place throned and secure And now
she stepped forward Apart from the impossibility of not acknowledging
her he wished to do it He wanted to wear her publicly though she was
not his he wanted to take his allegiance oath though his sovereign
heeded not

I have considered the question he said and I have quite made up my
mind whom I want to marry She is Miss Falbe Miss Sylvia Falbe of whom
you may have heard as a singer She is the sister of my musicmaster
and I can certainly marry nobody else

It was not merely defiance of the dreadful old tradition which Lord
Ashbridge had announced in the manner of Moses stepping down from Sinai
that prompted this appalling statement of the case it was the joy
in the profession of his love It had to be flung out like that Lord
Ashbridge looked at him a moment in dead silence

I have not the honour of knowing MissMiss Falbe is it he said
nor shall I have that honour

Michael got up there was that in his fathers tone that stung him to
fury

It is very likely that you will not he said since when I proposed
to her yesterday she did not accept me

Somehow Lord Ashbridge felt that as an insult to himself Indeed it was
a double insult Michael had proposed to this singer and this singer
had not instantly clutched him He gave his dreadful little treble
giggle

And I am to bind up your broken heart he asked

Michael drew himself up to his full height This was an indiscretion
for it but made his father recognise how short he was It brought farce
into the tragic situation

Oh by no means he said My heart is not going to break yet I dont
give up hope

Then in a flash he thought of his mothers pale anxious face her
desire that he should not vex his father

I am sorry he said but that is the case I wishI wish you would
try to understand me

I find you incomprehensible said Lord Ashbridge and left the room
with his high walk and his swinging elbows

Well it was done now and Michael felt that there were no new vexations
to be sprung on his father It was bound to happen he supposed sooner
or later and he was not sorry that it had happened sooner than he
expected or intended Sylvia so held sway in him that he could not help
acknowledging her His announcement had broken from him irresistibly
in spite of his mothers whispered word to him last night This is our
secret It could not be secret when his father spoke like that   
And then with a flare of illumination he perceived how intensely his
father disliked him Nothing but sheer basic antipathy could have been
responsible for that miserable retort Am I to bind up your broken
heart Anger no doubt was the immediate cause but so utterly
ungenerous a rejoinder to Michaels announcement could not have been
conceived except in a heart that thoroughly and rootedly disliked him
That he was a continual monument of disappointment to his father he knew
well but never before had it been quite plainly shown him how essential
an object of dislike he was And the grounds of the dislike were now
equally plainhis father disliked him exactly because he was his
father On the other hand the last twentyfour hours had shown him that
his mother loved him exactly because he was her son When these two new
and undeniable facts were put side by side Michael felt that he was an
infinite gainer

He went rather drearily to the window Far off across the field below
the garden he could see Lord Ashbridge walking airily along on his way
to the links with his head held high his stick swinging in his
hand his two retrievers at his heels No doubt already the soothing
influences of Nature were at workNature of course standing for the
portion of trees and earth and houses that belonged to himand were
expunging the depressing reflection that his wife and only son inspired
in him And indeed such was actually the case Lord Ashbridge in his
amazing fatuity could not long continue being himself without being
cheered and invigorated by that fact and though when he set out his
big white hands were positively trembling with passion he carried
his balsam always with him But he had registered to himself even
as Michael had registered the fact that he found his son a most
intolerable person And what vexed him most of all what made him clang
the gate at the end of the field so violently that it hit one of his
retrievers shrewdly on the nose was the sense of his own impotence He
knew perfectly well that in point of view of determination that quality
which in himself was firmness and in those who opposed him obstinacy
Michael was his match And the annoying thing was that as his wife had
once told him Michael undoubtedly inherited that quality from him It
was as inalienable as the estates of which he had threatened to deprive
his son and which as he knew quite well were absolutely entailed
Michael in this regard seemed no better than a common but successful
thief He had annexed his fathers firmness and at his death would
certainly annex all his pictures and trees and acres and the red roofs
of Ashbridge

Michael saw the gate so imperially slammed he heard the despairing howl
of Robin and though he was sorry for Robin he could not help laughing
He remembered also a ludicrous sight he had seen at the Zoological
Gardens a few days ago two seals sitting bolt upright quarrelling
with each other and making the most absurd grimaces and noises They
neither of them quite dared to attack the other and so sat with their
faces close together saying the rudest things Aunt Barbara would
certainly have seen how inimitably his father and he had in their
interview just now resembled the two seals

And then he became aware that all the time au fond he had thought
about nothing but Sylvia and of Sylvia not as the subject of quarrel
but as just Sylvia the singing Sylvia with a hand on his shoulder

The winter sun was warm on the south terrace of the house when an hour
later he strolled out according to arrangement with his mother It
had melted the rime of the night before that lay now on the grass in
threads of minute diamonds though below the terrace wall and on the
sunk rims of the empty garden beds it still persisted in outline of
white heraldry A few monthly roses weak pink blossoms weary with
the toil of keeping hope alive till the coming of spring hung dejected
heads in the sunk garden where the hornbeam hedge that carried its
russet leaves unfallen shaded them from the wind Here too a few
bulbs had pricked their way above ground and stood with stout erect
horns daintily capped with rime All these things which for years
had been presented to Lady Ashbridges notice without attracting her
attention now filled her with minute childlike pleasure they were
discoveries as entrancing and as magical as the first finding of
the oval pieces of blue sky that a child sees one morning in a
hedgesparrows nest Now that she was alone with her son all her
secret restlessness and anxiety had vanished and she remarked almost
with glee that her husband had telephoned from the golf links to say
that he would not be back for lunch then remembering that Michael
had gone to talk to his father after breakfast she asked him about the
interview

Michael had already made up his mind as to what to say here Knowing
that his father was anxious about her he felt it highly unlikely that
he would tell her anything to distress her and so he represented the
interview as having gone off in perfect amity Later in the day on
his fathers return he had made up his mind to propose a truce between
them as far as his mother was concerned Whether that would be accepted
or not he could not certainly tell but in the interval there was
nothing to be gained by grieving her

A great weight was lifted off her mind

Ah my dear that is good she said I was anxious So now perhaps we
shall have a peaceful Christmas I am glad your Aunt Barbara and Francis
are coming for though your aunt always laughs at your father she does
it kindly does she not And as for Francismy dear if God had given
me two sons I should have liked the other to be like Francis And shall
we walk a little farther this way and see poor Petsys grave

Petsys grave proved rather agitating There were doleful little stories
of the last days to be related and Petsy II was tiresome and insisted
on defying the world generally with shrill barkings from the top of
the small mound conscious perhaps that his helpless predecessor slept
below Then their walk brought them to the band of trees that separated
the links from the house from which Lady Ashbridge retreated fearful
as she vaguely phrased it of being seen and by whom there was no
need for her to explain Then across the field came a group of children
scampering home from school They ceased their shouting and their games
as the others came near and demurely curtsied and took off their caps
to Lady Ashbridge

Nice wellbehaved children said she A merry Christmas to you all
I hope you are all good children to your mothers as my son is to me

She pressed his arm nodded and smiled at the children and walked on
with him And Michael felt the lump in his throat

The arrival of Aunt Barbara and Francis that afternoon did something by
the mere addition of numbers to the party to relieve the tension of the
situation Lord Ashbridge said little but ate largely and during the
intervals of empty plates directed an impartial gaze at the portraits of
his ancestors while wholly ignoring his descendant But Michael was too
wise to put himself into places where he could be pointedly ignored and
the resplendent dinner with its six footmen and its silver service
was not really more joyless than usual But his fathers majestic
displeasure was more apparent when the three men sat alone afterwards
and it was in dead silence that port was pushed round and cigarettes
handed Francis it is true made a couple of efforts to enliven things
but his remarks produced no response whatever from his uncle and he
subsided into himself thinking with regret of what an amusing evening
he would have had if he had only stopped in town But when they rose
Michael signed to his cousin to go on and planted himself firmly in the
path to the door It was evident that his father did not mean to speak
to him but he could not push by him or walk over him

There is one thing I want to say to you father said he I have told
my mother that our interview this morning was quite amicable I do not
see why she should be distressed by knowing that it was not

His fathers face softened a moment

Yes I agree to that he said


As far as that went the compact was observed and whenever Lady
Ashbridge was present her husband made a point of addressing a few
remarks to Michael but there their intercourse ended Michael found
opportunity to explain to Aunt Barbara what had happened suggesting
as a consolatory simile the domestic difficulties of the seals at the
Zoological Gardens and was pleased to find her recognise the aptness of
this description But heaviest of all on the spirits of the whole party
sat the anxiety about Lady Ashbridge There could be no doubt that
some cerebral degeneration was occurring and Lady Barbaras urgent
representation to her brother had the effect of making him promise
to take her up to London without delay after Christmas and let a
specialist see her For the present the pious fraud practised on her
that Michael and his father had had a good talk together and were
excellent friends sufficed to render her happy and cheerful She
had long dim talks full of repetition with Michael whose presence
appeared to make her completely content and when he was out or away
from her she would sit eagerly waiting for his return Petsy to the
great benefit of his health got somewhat neglected by her her whole
nature and instincts were alight with the motherlove that had burnt
so late into flame with this tragic accompaniment of derangement She
seemed to be groping her way back to the days when Michael was a little
boy and she was a young woman often she would seat herself at her
piano if Michael was not there to play to her and in a thin quavering
voice sing the songs of twenty years ago She would listen to his
playing beating time to his music and most of all she loved the hour
when the day was drawing in and the first shadow and flame of dusk and
firelight then with her hand in his sitting in her room where
they would not be interrupted she would whisper fresh inquiries about
Sylvia offering to go herself to the girl and tell her how lovable
her suitor was She lived in a dim subaqueous sort of consciousness
physically quite well and mentally serene in the knowledge that Michael
was in the house and would presently come and talk to her

For the others it was dismal enough this shadow that was to her a
watery sunlight lay over them allthis and the further quarrel
unknown to her between Michael and his father When they all met as
at meal times there was the miserable pretence of friendliness and
comfortable ease kept up for fear of distressing Lady Ashbridge It
was dreary work for all concerned but luckily not difficult of
accomplishment A little chatter about the weather the merest small
change of conversation especially if that conversation was held between
Michael and his father was sufficient to wreathe her in smiles and
she would according to habit break in with some wrecking remark that
entailed starting this talk all afresh But when she left the room a
glowering silence would fall Lord Ashbridge would pick up a book or
leave the room with his highstepping walk and erect head the picture
of insulted dignity

Of the three he was far most to be pitied although the situation
was the direct result of his own arrogance and selfimportance but
arrogance and selfimportance were as essential ingredients of his
character as was humour of Aunt Barbaras They were very awkward and
tiresome qualities but this particular Lord Ashbridge would have
no existence without them He was deeply and mortally offended with
Michael that alone was sufficient to make a sultry and stifling
atmosphere and in addition to that he had the burden of his anxiety
about his wife Here came an extra sting for in common humanity he had
by appearing to be friends with Michael to secure her serenity and
this could only be done by the continued profanation of his own highly
proper and necessary attitude towards his son He had to address
friendly words to Michael that really almost choked him he had to
practise cordiality with this wretch who wanted to marry the sister of
a musicmaster Michael had pulled up all the old traditions that
carefullytended and pompous flowergarden as if they had been weeds
and thrown them in his fathers face It was indeed no wonder that in
his wifes absence he almost burst with indignation over the desecrated
beds More than that his own selfesteem was hurt by his wifes fear of
him just as if he had been a hard and unkind husband to her which he
had not been but merely a very selfabsorbed and dominant one while
the one person who could make her quite happy was his despised son
Michaels person Michaels tastes Michaels whole presence and
character were repugnant to him and yet Michael had the power which to
do Lord Ashbridge justice he would have given much to be possessed of
himself of bringing comfort and serenity to his wife

On the afternoon of the day following Christmas the two cousins had been
across the estuary to Ashbridge together Francis who in spite of his
habitual easiness of disposition and general good temper had found the
conditions of anger and anxiety quite intolerable had settled to leave
next day instead of stopping till the end of the week and Michael
acquiesced in this without any sense of desertion he had really only
wondered why Francis had stopped three nights instead of finding urgent
private business in town after one He realised also somewhat with
surprise that Francis was no good when there was trouble about there
was no one so delightful when there was so to speak a contest of who
should enjoy himself the most and Francis invariably won But if
the subject of the contest was changed and the prize given for the
individual who under depressing circumstances should contrive to show
the greatest serenity of aspect Francis would have lost with an even
greater margin Michael in fact was rather relieved than otherwise
at his cousins immediate departure for it helped nobody to see the
martyred St Sebastian and it was merely odious for St Sebastian
himself In fact at this moment when Michael was rowing them back
across the fullflooded estuary Francis was explaining this with his
customary lucidity

I dont do any good here Mike he said Uncle Robert doesnt speak
to me any more than he does to you except when Aunt Marion is there
And theres nothing going on is there I practically asked if I might
go duckshooting today and Uncle Robert merely looked out of the
window But if anybody specially you wanted me to stop why of course
I would

But I dont said Michael

Thanks awfully Gosh look at those ducks Theyre just wanting to be
shot But there it is then Certainly Uncle Robert doesnt want me nor
Aunt Marion I say what do they think is the matter with her

Michael looked round then took rather too late another pull on his
oars and the boat gently grated on the pebbly mud at the side of the
landingplace Franciss question the goodhumoured insouciance of it
grated on his mind in rather similar fashion

We dont know yet he said I expect we shall all go back to town in
a couple of days so that she may see somebody

Francis jumped out briskly and gracefully and stood with his hands in
his pockets while Michael pushed off again and brought the boat into
its shed

I do hope its nothing serious he said She looks quite well
doesnt she I daresay its nothing but shes been alone hasnt she
with Uncle Robert all these weeks That would give her the hump too

Michael felt a sudden spasm of impatience at these elegant and consoling
reflections But now in the light of his own increasing maturity he
saw how hopeless it was to feel Franciss deficiencies his entire lack
of deep feeling He was made like that and if you were fond of anybody
the only possible way of living up to your affection was to attach
yourself to their qualities

They strolled a little way in silence

And why did you tell Uncle Robert about Sylvia Falbe asked Francis
I cant understand that For the present anyhow she had refused you
There was nothing to tell him about If I was fond of a girl like that I
should say nothing about it if I knew my people would disapprove until
I had got her

Michael laughed

Oh yes you would he said if you were to use your own words
fond of her like that You couldnt help it At least I couldnt
Itsits such a glory to be fond like that

He stopped

We wont talk about it he saidor rather I cant talk about it
if you dont understand

But she had refused you said the sensible Francis

That makes no difference She shines through everything through the
infernal awfulness of these days through my fathers anger and my
mothers illness whatever it proves to beI think about them really
with all my might and at the end I find Ive been thinking about
Sylvia Everything is shethe woods the tideoh I cant explain

They had walked across the marshy land at the edge of the estuary and
now in front of them was the steep and direct path up to the house
and the longer way through the woods At this point the estuary made
a sudden turn to the left sweeping directly seawards and round the
corner immediately in front of them was the long reach of deep water
up which even when the tide was at its lowest an oceangoing steamer
could penetrate if it knew the windings of the channel Today in the
windless cold calm of midwinter though the sun was brilliant in a
blue sky overhead an opaque mist thick as cottonwool lay over the
surface of the water and taking the winding road through the woods
which following the estuary turned the point they presently found
themselves as they mounted quite clear of the mist that lay below them
on the river Their steps were noiseless on the mossy path and almost
immediately after they had turned the corner as Francis paused to light
a cigarette they heard from just below them the creaking of oars in
their rowlocks It caught the ears of them both and without conscious
curiosity they listened On the moment the sound of rowing ceased and
from the dense mist just below them there came a sound which was quite
unmistakable namely the plop of something heavy dropped into the
water That sound by some remote form of association suddenly recalled
to Michaels mind certain questions Aunt Barbara had asked him about the
Emperors stay at Ashbridge and his own recollection of his having gone
up and down the river in a launch There was something further which he
did not immediately recollect Yes it was the request that if when he
was here at Christmas he found strangers hanging about the deepwater
reach of which the chart was known only to the Admiralty he should
let her know Here at this moment they were overlooking the mistswathed
water and here at this moment unseen was a boat rowing stealthily
stopping and perhaps making soundings

He laid his hand on Franciss arm with a gesture for silence then
invisible below someone said Fifteen fathoms and again the oars
creaked audibly in the rowlocks

Michael took a step towards his cousin so that he could whisper to him

Come back to the boat he said I want to row round and see who that
is Wait a moment though

The oars below made some halfdozen strokes and then were still again
Once more there came the sound of something heavy dropped into the
water

Someone is making soundings in the channel there he said Come

They went very quietly till they were round the point then quickened
their steps and Michael spoke

Thats the uncharted channel he said at least only the Admiralty
have the soundings The waters deep enough right across for a ship
of moderate draught to come up but there is a channel up which any
manofwar can pass Of course it may be an Admiralty boat making fresh
soundings but not likely on Boxing Day

What are you going to do asked Francis striding easily along by
Michaels short steps

Just see if we can find out who it is Aunt Barbara asked me about it
Ill tell you afterwards Now the tides going out we can drop down
with it and we shant be heard Ill row just enough to keep her head
straight Sit in the bow Francis and keep a sharp lookout

Foot by foot they dropped down the river and soon came into the thick
mist that lay beyond the point It was impossible to see more than
a yard or two ahead but the same dense obscurity would prevent any
further range of vision from the other boat and if it was still at its
work the sound of its oars or of voices Michael reflected might guide
him to it From the lisp of little wavelets lapping on the shore below
the woods he knew he was quite close in to the bank and close also to
the place where the invisible boat had been ten minutes before Then
in the bewildering unlocalised manner in which sound without the
corrective guidance of sight comes to the ears he heard as before the
creaking of invisible oars somewhere quite close at hand Next moment
the dark prow of a rowingboat suddenly loomed into sight on their
starboard and he took a rapid stroke with his righthand scull to bring
them up to it But at the same moment while yet the occupants of the
other boat were but shadows in the mist they saw him and a quick word
of command rang out

Rowrow hard it cried and with a frenzied churning of oars in the
water the other boat shot by them making down the estuary Next moment
it had quite vanished in the mist leaving behind it knots of swirling
water from its oarblades

Michael started in vain pursuit his craft was heavy and clumsy and
from the retreating and faintgrowing sound of the other it was clear
that he could get no pace to match still less to overtake them Soon he
pantingly desisted

But an Admiralty boat wouldnt have run away he said Theyd have
asked us who the devil we were

But who else was it asked Francis

Michael mopped his forehead

Aunt Barbara would tell you he said She would tell you that they
were German spies

Francis laughed

Or Timbuctoo niggers he remarked

And that would be an odd thing too said Michael

But at that moment he felt the first chill of the shadow that
menaced if by chance Aunt Barbara was right and if already the clear
tranquillity of the sky was growing dim as with the mist that lay
that afternoon on the waters of the deep reach and covered mysterious
movements which were going on below it England and Germanythere was
so much of his life and his heart there Music and song and Sylvia


CHAPTER X


Michael had heard the verdict of the brain specialist who yesterday had
seen his mother and was sitting in his room beside his unopened
piano quietly assimilating it and without making plans of his own
initiative contemplating the forms into which the future was beginning
to fall mapping itself out below him outlining itself as when objects
in a room as the light of morning steals in take shape again And even
as they take the familiar shapes so already he felt that he had guessed
all this in that week down at Ashbridge from which he had returned with
his father and mother a couple of days before

She was suffering without doubt from some softening of the brain
nothing of remedial nature could possibly be done to arrest or cure the
progress of the disease and all that lay in human power was to secure
for her as much content and serenity as possible In her present
condition there was no question of putting her under restraint nor
indeed could she be certified by any doctor as insane She would have
to have a trained attendant she would live a secluded life from which
must be kept as far as possible anything that could agitate or distress
her and after that there was nothing more that could be done except
to wait for the inevitable development of her malady This might come
quickly or slowly there was no means of forecasting that though the
rapid deterioration of her brain which had taken place during those
last two months made it on the whole likely that the progress of the
disease would be swift It was quite possible on the other hand that
it might remain stationary for months    And in answer to a question
of Michaels Sir James had looked at him a moment in silence Then he
answered

Both for her sake and for the sake of all of you he had said one
hopes that it will be swift


Lord Ashbridge had just telephoned that he was coming round to see
Michael a message that considerably astonished him since it would have
been more in his manner in the unlikely event of his wishing to see his
son to have summoned him to the house in Curzon Street However he had
announced his advent and thus waiting for him and not much concerning
himself about that Michael let the future map itself Already it was
sharply defined its boundaries and limits were clear and though it was
yet untravelled it presented to him a familiar aspect and he felt that
he could find his allotted road without fail though he had never yet
traversed it It was strongly marked there could be no difficulty or
question about it Indeed a week ago when first the recognition of his
mothers condition with the symptoms attached to it was known to him
he had seen the signpost that directed him into the future

Lord Ashbridge made his usual flamboyant entry prancing and swinging
his elbows Whatever happened he would still be Lord Ashbridge with his
grey tophat and his large carnation and his enviable position

You will have heard what Sir Jamess opinion is about your poor
mother he said It was in consequence of what he recommended when he
talked over the future with me that I came to see you

Michael guessed very well what this recommendation was but with a
certain stubbornness and sense of what was due to himself he let his
father proceed with the not very welcome task of telling him

In fact Michael he said I have a favour to ask of you

The fact of his being Lord Ashbridge and the fact of Michael being his
unsatisfactory son stiffened him and he had to qualify the favour

Perhaps I should not say I am about to ask you a favour he corrected
himself but rather to point out to you what is your obvious duty

Suddenly it struck Michael that his father was not thinking about Lady
Ashbridge at all nor about him but in the main about himself All
had to be done from the dominant standpoint he owed it to himself to
alleviate the conditions under which his wife must live he owed it to
himself that his son should do his part as a Comber There was no longer
any possible doubt as to what this favour or this direction of duty
must be but still Michael chose that his father should state it He
pushed a chair forward for him

Wont you sit down he said

Thank you I would rather stand Yes it is not so much a favour as the
indication of your duty I do not know if you will see it in the same
light as I you have shown me before now that we do not take the same
view

Michael felt himself bristling His father certainly had the effect of
drawing out in him all the feelings that were better suppressed

I think we need not talk of that now sir he remarked

Certainly it is not the subject of my interview with you now The fact
is this In some way your presence gives a certain serenity and content
to your mother I noticed that at Ashbridge and indeed there has been
some trouble with her this morning because I could not take her to come
to see you with me I ask you therefore for her sake to be with us as
much as you can in short to come and live with us

Michael nodded saluting so to speak the signpost into the future as
he passed it

I had already determined to do that he said I had determined at
any rate to ask your permission to do so It is clear that my mother
wants me and no other consideration can weigh with that

Lord Ashbridge still remained completely selfsufficient

I am glad you take that view of it he said I think that is all I
have to say

Now Michael was an adept at giving as indicated before when he
gave he gave nobly and he could not only outwardly disregard but
he inwardly cancelled the wonderful ungenerosity with which his father
received That did not concern him

I will make arrangements to come at once he said if you can receive
me today

That will hardly be worth while will it I am taking your mother back
to Ashbridge tomorrow

Michael got up in silence After all this gift of himself of his time
of his liberty of all that constituted life to him was made not to
his father but to his mother It was made as his heart knew not
ungrudgingly only but eagerly and if it had been recommended by
the doctor that she should go to Ashbridge he would have entirely
disregarded the large additional sacrifice on himself which it entailed
Thus it was not owing to any retraction of his gift or reconsideration
of it that he demurred

I hope you willwill meet me halfway about this sir he said You
must remember that all my work lies in London I want naturally to
continue that as far as I can If you go to Ashbridge it is completely
interrupted My friends are here too everything I have is here

His father seemed to swell a little he appeared to fill the room

And all my duties lie at Ashbridge he said As you know I am not
of the type of absentee landlords It is quite impossible that I should
spend these months in idleness in town I have never done such a thing
yet nor I may say would our class hold the position they do if we
did We shall come up to town after Easter should your mothers health
permit it but till then I could not dream of neglecting my duties in
the country

Now Michael knew perfectly well what his fathers duties on that
excellently managed estate were They consisted of a biweekly interview
in the businessroom an abode of files and stags heads in which
Lord Ashbridge received various reports of building schemes and
repairs of a round of golf every afternoon and of reading the
lessons and handing the offertorybox on Sunday That at least was
the sumtotal as it presented itself to him and on which he framed
his conclusions But he left out altogether the moral effect of the
big landlord living on his own land and being surrounded by his
own dependents which his father on the other hand so vastly
overestimated It was clear that there was not likely to be much accord
between them on this subject

But could you not go down there perhaps once or twice a week and get
Bailey to come and consult you here he asked

Lord Ashbridge held his head very high

That would be completely out of the question he said

All this Michael felt had nothing to do with the problem of his
mother and himself It was outside it altogether and concerned only
his fathers convenience He was willing to press this point as far as
possible

I had imagined you would stop in London he said Supposing under
these circumstances I refuse to live with you

I should draw my own conclusion as to the sincerity of your profession
of duty towards your mother

And practically what would you do asked Michael

Your mother and I would go to Ashbridge tomorrow all the same

Another alternative suddenly suggested itself to Michael which he was
almost ashamed of proposing for it implied that his father put his own
convenience as outweighing any other consideration But he saw that if
only Lord Ashbridge was selfish enough to consent to it it had manifest
merits His mother would be alone with him free of the presence that so
disconcerted her

I propose then he said that she and I should remain in town as
you want to be at Ashbridge

He had been almost ashamed of suggesting it but no such shame was
reflected in his fathers mind This would relieve him of the perpetual
embarrassment of his wifes presence and the perpetual irritation of
Michaels He had persuaded himself that he was making a tremendous
personal sacrifice in proposing that Michael should live with them and
this relieved him of the necessity

Upon my word Michael he said with the first hint of cordiality that
he had displayed that is very well thought of Let us consider it is
certainly the case that this derangement in your poor mothers mind has
caused her to take what I might almost call a dislike to me I mentioned
that to Sir James though it was very painful for me to do so and he
said that it was a common and most distressing symptom of brain disease
that the sufferer often turned against those he loved best Your plan
would have the effect of removing that

He paused a moment and became even more sublimely fatuous

You too he said it would obviate the interruption of your work
about which you feel so keenly You would be able to go on with it Of
myself I dont think at all I shall be lonely no doubt at Ashbridge
but my own personal feelings must not be taken into account Yes it
seems to me a very sensible notion We shall have to see what your
mother says to it She might not like me to be away from her in spite
of her apparenterdislike of me It must all depend on her attitude
But for my part I think very well of your scheme Thank you Michael
for suggesting it

He left immediately after this to ascertain Lady Ashbridges feelings
about it and walked home with a complete resumption of his usual
exuberance It indeed seemed an admirable plan It relieved him from
the nightmare of his wifes continual presence and this he expressed
to himself by thinking that it relieved her from his It was not that
he was deficient in sympathy for her for in his selfcentred way he was
fond of her but he could sympathise with her just as well at Ashbridge
He could do no good to her and he had not for her that instinct of love
which would make it impossible for him to leave her He would also be
spared the constant irritation of having Michael in the house and this
he expressed to himself by saying that Michael disliked him and would
be far more at his ease without him Furthermore Michael would be able
to continue his studies    of this too in spite of the fact that he
had always done his best to discourage them he made a selflaudatory
translation by telling himself that he was very glad not to have
to cause Michael to discontinue them In fine he persuaded himself
without any difficulty that he was a very fine fellow in consenting to
a plan that suited him so admirably and only wondered that he had not
thought of it himself There was nothing after his wife had expressed
her joyful acceptance of it to detain him in town and he left for
Ashbridge that afternoon while Michael moved into the house in Curzon
Street

Michael entered upon his new life without the smallest sense of having
done anything exceptional or even creditable It was so perfectly
obvious to him that he had to be with his mother that he had no
inclination to regard himself at all in the matter the thing was
as simple as it had been to him to help Francis out of financial
difficulties with a gift of money There was no effort of will no
sense of sacrifice about it it was merely the assertion of a paramount
instinct The life limited his freedom for for a great part of the day
he was with his mother and between his music and his attendance on her
he had but little leisure Occasionally he went out to see his friends
but any prolonged absence on his part always made her uneasy and he
would often find her on his return sitting in the hall waiting
for him so as to enjoy his presence from the first moment that he
reentered the house But though he found no food for reflection in
himself Aunt Barbara who came to see them some few days after Michael
had been installed here found a good deal

They had all had tea together and afterwards Lady Ashbridges nurse had
come down to fetch her upstairs to rest And then Aunt Barbara surprised
Michael for she came across the room to him with her kind eyes full of
tears and kissed him

My dear I must say it once she said and then you will know that it
is always in my mind You have behaved nobly Michael its a big word
but I know no other As for your father

Michael interrupted her

Oh I dont understand him he said At least thats the best way to
look at it Lets leave him out

He paused a moment

After all it is a much better plan than our living all three of us at
Ashbridge Its better for my mother and for me and for him

I know but how he could consent to the better plan she said Well
let us leave him out Poor Robert He and his golf My dear your father
is a very ludicrous person you know But about you Michael do you
think you can stand it

He smiled at her

Why of course I can he said Indeed I dont think Ill accept that
statement of it Itsits such a score to be able to be of use you
know I can make my mother happy Nobody else can I think Im getting
rather conceited about it

Yes dear I find you insufferable remarked Aunt Barbara
parenthetically

Then you must just bear it The thing isMichael took a moment to
find the words he searched forthe thing is I want to be wanted Well
its no light thing to be wanted by your mother even if

He sat down on the sofa by his aunt

Aunt Barbara how ironically gifts come he said This was rather a
sinister way of giving that my mother should want me like this just as
her brain was failing And yet that failure doesnt affect the quality
of her love Is it something that shines through the poor tattered
fabric Anyhow it has nothing to do with her brain It is she herself
somehow not anything of hers that wants me And you ask if I can stand
it

Michael with his ugly face and his kind eyes and his simple heart seemed
extraordinarily charming just then to Aunt Barbara She wished that
Sylvia could have seen him then in all the unconsciousness of what he
was doing so unquestioningly or that she could have seen him as she
had with his mother during the last hour Lady Ashbridge had insisted
on sitting close to him and holding his hand whenever she could possess
herself of it of plying him with a hundred repeated questions and
never once had she made Michael either ridiculous or selfconscious And
this she reflected went on most of the day and for how many days it
would go on none knew Yet Michael could not consider even whether he
could stand it he rejected the expression as meaningless

And your friends she said Do you manage to see them

Oh yes occasionally said Michael They dont come here for the
presence of strangers makes my mother agitated She thinks they have
some design of taking her or me away But she wants to see Sylvia She
knows aboutabout her and me and I cant make up my mind what to do
about it She is always asking if I cant take her to see Sylvia or get
her to come here

And why not Sylvia knows about your mother I suppose

I expect so I told Hermann But I am afraid my mother willwell you
cant call it arguingbut will try to persuade her to have me I cant
let Sylvia in for that Nor if it comes to that can I let myself in
for that

Cant you impress on your mother that she mustnt

Michael leaned forward to the fire pondering this and stretching out
his big hands to the blaze

Yes I might he said I should love to see Sylvia again just
see her you know We settled that the old terms we were on couldnt
continue At least I settled that and she understood

Sylvia is a gaby remarked Aunt Barbara

Im rather glad you think so

Oh get her to come said she Im sure your mother will do as you
tell her Ill be here too if you like if that will do any good By
the way I see your Hermanns piano recital comes off tomorrow

I know My mother wants to go to that and I think I shall take her
Will you come too Aunt Barbara and sit on the other side of her My
Variations are going to be played If they are a success Hermann
tells me I shall be dragged screaming on to the platform and have to
bow Lord And if theyre not well Lord also

Yes my dear of course Ill come Let me see I shall have to lie as
I have another engagement but a little thing like that doesnt bother
me

Suddenly she clapped her hands together

My dear I quite forgot she said Michael such excitement You
remember the boat you heard taking soundings on the deepwater reach Of
course you do Well I sent that information to the proper quarter and
since then watch has been kept in the woods just above it Last night
only the coastguard police caught four men at itall Germans They
tried to escape as they did before by rowing down the river but there
was a steam launch below which intercepted them They had on them a
chart of the reach with soundings nearly complete and when they
searched their housesthey are all tenants of your astute father who
merely laughed at usthey found a very decent map of certain private
areas at Harwich Oh Im not such a fool as I look They thanked me my
dear for my information and I very gracefully said that my information
was chiefly got by you

But did those men live in Ashbridge asked Michael

Yes and your father will have four decorous houses on his hands I am
glad he should not have laughed at us It will teach him I hope And
now my dear I must go

She stood up and put her hand on Michaels arm

And you know what I think of you she said Tomorrow evening then
I hate music usually but then I adore Mr Hermann I only wish he
wasnt a German Cant you get him to naturalise himself and his
sister

You wouldnt ask that if you had seen him in Munich said Michael

I suppose not Patriotism is such a degrading emotion when it is not
English


Michaels Variations came some halfway down the programme next
evening and as the moment for them approached Lady Ashbridge got more
and more excited

I hope he knows them by heart properly dear she whispered to
Michael I shall be so nervous for fear hell forget them in the
middle which is so liable to happen if you play without your notes

Michael laid his hand on his mothers

Hush mother he said you mustnt talk while hes playing

Well I was only whispering But if you tell me I mustnt

The hall was crammed from end to end for not only was Hermann a person
of innumerable friends but he had already a considerable reputation
and being a German all musical England went to hear him And tonight
he was playing superbly after a couple of days of miserable nervousness
over his debut as a pianist but his temperament was one of those
that are strung up to their highest pitch by such nervous agonies he
required just that to make him do full justice to his own personality
and long before he came to the Variations Michael felt quite at ease
about his success There was no question about it any more the
whole audience knew that they were listening to a master In the row
immediately behind Michaels party were sitting Sylvia and her mother
who had not quite been torn away from her novels since she had sought
The Love of Hermione Hogarth underneath her cloak and read it
furtively in pauses They had come in after Michael and until the
interval between the classical and the modern section of the concert he
was unaware of their presence then idly turning round to look at the
crowded hall he found himself face to face with the girl

I had no idea you were there he said Hermann will do wont he I
think

And then suddenly the words of commonplace failed him and he looked at
her in silence

I knew you were back she said Hermann told me abouteverything

Michael glanced sideways indicating his mother who sat next him and
was talking to Barbara

I wondered whether perhaps you would come and see my mother and me he
said May I write

She looked at him with the friendliness of her smiling eyes and her
grave mouth

Is it necessary to ask she said

Michael turned back to his seat for his mother had had quite enough of
her sisterinlaw and wanted him again She looked over her shoulder
for a moment to see whom Michael was talking to

Im enjoying my concert dear she said And who is that nice young
lady Is she a friend of yours

The interval was over and Hermann returned to the platform and waiting
for a moment for the buzz of conversation to die down gave out
without any preliminary excursion on the keys the text of Michaels
Variations Then he began to tell them with light and flying fingers
what that simple tune had suggested to Michael how he imagined himself
looking on at an oldfashioned dance and while the dancers moved to
the graceful measure of a minuet or daintily in a gavotte the tune of
Good King Wenceslas still rang in his head or how in the joy of
the sunlight of a spring morning it still haunted him It lay behind
a cascade of foaming waters that leaping roared into a ravine it
marched with flying banners on some day of victorious entry it watched
a funeral procession wind by with tapers and the smell of incense it
heard as it got nearer back to itself again the peals of Christmas
bells and stood forth again in its own person decorated and
emblazoned

Hermann had already captured his audience now he held them tame in the
hollow of his hand Twice he bowed and then in answer to the demand
just beckoned with his finger to Michael who rose For a moment his
mother wished to detain him

Youre not going to leave me my dear are you she asked anxiously

He waited to explain to her quietly left her and feeling rather
dazed made his way round to the back and saw the open door on to the
platform confronting him He felt that no power on earth could make him
step into the naked publicity there but at the moment Hermann appeared
in the doorway

Come on Mike he said laughing Thank the pretty ladies and
gentlemen Lord isnt it all a lark

Michael advanced with him stared and hoped he smiled properly though
he felt that he was nailing some hideous grimace to his face and then
just below him he saw his mother eagerly pointing him out to a total
stranger with gesticulation and just behind her Sylvia looking at her
and not at him with such tenderness such kindly pity There were the
two most intimately bound into his life the mother who wanted him the
girl whom he wanted and by his side was Hermann who as Michael always
knew had thrown open the gates of life to him All the rest even
including Aunt Barbara seemed of no significance in that moment
Afterwards no doubt he would be glad they were pleased be proud of
having pleased them but just now even when for the first time in his
life that intoxicating wine of appreciation was given him he stood
with it bubbling and yellow in his hand not drinking of it


Michael had prepared the way of Sylvias coming by telling his mother
the identity of the nice young lady at the concert he had also
impressed on her the paramount importance of not saying anything with
regard to him that could possibly embarrass the nice young lady and
when Sylvia came to tea a few days later he was quite without any
uneasiness while for himself he was only conscious of that thirst for
her physical presence the desire as he had said to Aunt Barbara just
to see her Nor was there the slightest embarrassment in their meeting
it was clear that there was not the least difficulty either for him
or her in being natural which as usually happens was the complete
solution

That is good of you to come he said meeting her almost at the door
My mother has been looking forward to your visit Mother dear here is
Miss Falbe

Lady Ashbridge was pathetically eager to be what she called good
Michael had made it clear to her that it was his wish that Miss Falbe
should not be embarrassed and any wish just now expressed by Michael
was of the nature of a divine command to her

Well this is a pleasure she said looking across to Michael with the
eyes of a dog on a beloved master And we are not strangers quite are
we Miss Falbe We sat so near each other to listen to your brother who
I am sure plays beautifully and the music which Michael made Havent I
got a clever son and such a good one

Sylvia was unerring Michael had known she would be

Indeed you have she said sitting down by her And Michael mustnt
hear what we say about him must he or hell be getting conceited

Lady Ashbridge laughed

And that would never do would it she said still retaining Sylvias
hand Then a little dim ripple of compunction broke in her mind
Michael she said we are only joking about your getting conceited
Miss Falbe and I are only joking Andand wont you take off your hat
Miss Falbe for you are not going to hurry away are you You are going
to pay us a long visit

Michael had not time to remind his mother that ladies who come to tea
do not usually take their hats off for on the word Sylvias hands were
busy with her hatpins

Im so glad you suggested that she said I always want to take my
hat off I dont know who invented hats but I wish he hadnt

Lady Ashbridge looked at her masses of bright hair and could not help
telegraphing a note of admiration as it were to Michael

Now thats more comfortable she said You look as if you werent
going away next minute When I like to see people I hate their going
away Im afraid sometimes that Michael will go away but he tells me he
wont And you liked Michaels music Miss Falbe Was it not clever of
him to think of all that out of one simple little tune And he tells me
you sing so nicely Perhaps you would sing to us when weve had tea Oh
and here is my sisterinlaw Do you know herLady Barbara My dear
what is your husbands name

Seeing Sylvia uncovered Lady Barbara with a tact that was creditable
to her but strangely unsuccessful also began taking off her hat Her
sisterinlaw was too polite to interfere but as a matter of fact she
did not take much pleasure in the notion that Barbara was going to stay
a very long time too She was fond of her but it was not Barbara whom
Michael wanted She turned her attention to the girl again

My husbands away she said confidentially he is very busy down at
Ashbridge and I daresay he wont find time to come up to town for many
weeks yet But you know Michael and I do very well without him
very well indeed and it would never do to take him away from his
dutieswould it Michael

Here was a shoal to be avoided

No you mustnt think of tempting him to come up to town said
Michael Give me some tea for Aunt Barbara

This answer entranced Lady Ashbridge she had to nudge Michael several
times to show that she understood the brilliance of it and put lump
after lump of sugar into Barbaras cup in her rapt appreciation of it
But very soon she turned to Sylvia again

And your brother is a friend of Michaels too isnt he she said
Some day perhaps he will come to see me We dont see many people
Michael and I for we find ourselves very well content alone But
perhaps some day he will come and play his concert over again to us and
then perhaps if you ask me I will sing to you I used to sing a great
deal when I was younger Michaelwhere has Michael gone

Michael had just left the room to bring some cigarettes in from next
door and Lady Ashbridge ran after him calling him She found him in
the hall and brought him back triumphantly

Now we will all sit and talk for a long time she said You one side
of me Miss Falbe and Michael the other Or would you be so kind as to
sing for us Michael will play for you and would it annoy you if I came
and turned over the pages It would give me a great deal of pleasure to
turn over for you if you will just nod each time when you are ready

Sylvia got up

Why of course she said What have you got Michael I havent
anything with me

Michael found a volume of Schubert and once again as on the first time
he had seen her she sang Who is Sylvia while he played and Lady
Ashbridge had her eyes fixed now on one and now on the other of them
waiting for their nod to do her part and then she wanted to sing
herself and with some faroff remembrance of the airs and graces of
twentyfive years ago she put her handkerchief and her rings on the
top of the piano and playing for herself emitted faint treble sounds
which they knew to be The Soldiers Farewell

Then presently her nurse came for her to lie down before dinner and she
was inclined to be tearful and refuse to go till Michael made it clear
that it was his express and sovereign will that she should do so Then
very audibly she whispered to him May I ask her to give me a kiss
she said She looks so kind Michael I dont think she would mind


Sylvia went back home with a little heartache for Michael wondering
if she was in his place if her mother instead of being absorbed in her
novels demanded such incessant attentions whether she had sufficient
love in her heart to render them with the exquisite simplicity the
tender patience that Michael showed Well as she knew him greatly as
she liked him she had not imagined that he or indeed any man could
have behaved quite like that There seemed no effort at all about it
he was not trying to be patient he had the sense of patiences perfect
work natural to him he did not seem to have to remind himself that his
mother was ill and thus he must be gentle with her He was gentle with
her because he was in himself gentle And yet though his behaviour was
no effort to him she guessed how wearying must be the continual strain
of the situation itself She felt that she would get cross from mere
fatigue however excellent her intentions might be however willing
the spirit And no one so she had understood from Barbara could take
Michaels place In his occasional absences his mother was fretful and
miserable and day by day Michael left her less She would sit close to
him when he was practisinga thing that to her or to Hermann would have
rendered practice impossibleand if he wrestled with one hand over a
difficult bar she would take the other into hers would ask him if he
was not getting tired would recommend him to rest for a little and yet
Michael who last summer had so stubbornly insisted on leading his own
life and had put his determination into effect in the teeth of all
domestic opposition now with more than cheerfulness laid his own life
aside in order to look after his mother Sylvia felt that the real
heroisms of life were not so much the fine heady deeds which are so
obviously admirable as such serene steadfastness such unvarying
patience as that which she had just seen

Her whole soul applauded Michael and yet below her applause was this
heartache for him the desire to be able to help him to bear the burden
which must be so heavy though he bore it so blithely But in the very
nature of things there was but one way in which she could help him and
in that she was powerless She could not give him what he wanted But
she longed to be able to


CHAPTER XI


It was a morning of early March and Michael looking out from the
diningroom window at the house in Curzon Street where he had just
breakfasted alone was smitten with wonder and a secret ecstasy for he
suddenly saw and felt that it was winter no longer but that spring had
come For the last week the skies had screamed with outrageous winds
and had been populous with flocks of sullen clouds that discharged
themselves in sleet and snowy rain and half last night for he had
slept very badly he had heard the dashing of showers as of winddriven
spray against the windowpanes and had listened to the fierce rattling
of the frames Towards morning he had slept and during those hours it
seemed that a new heaven and a new earth had come into being vitally
and essentially the world was a different affair altogether

At the back of the house on to which these windows looked was a garden
of some half acre a square of somewhat sooty grass bounded by high
walls with a few trees at the further end Into it too had the
message that thrilled through his bones penetrated and this little
oasis of doubtful grass and blackened shrubs had a totally different
aspect today from that which it had worn all those weeks The sparrows
that had sat with fluffedup feathers in corners sheltered from the
gales were suddenly busy and shrilly vocal chirruping and dragging
about straws and flying from limb to limb of the trees with twigs in
their beaks For the first time he noticed that little verdant cabochons
of folded leaf had globed themselves on the lilac bushes below the
window crocuses had budded and in the garden beds had shot up the
pushing spikes of bulbs while in the sooty grass he could see specks
and patches of vivid green the first growth of the year

He opened the window and strolled out The whole taste and savour of the
air was changed and borne on the primrosecoloured sunshine came the
smell of damp earth no longer dead and reeking of the decay of autumn
but redolent with some new element something fertile and fecund
something daintily indefinably laden with the secret of life and
restoration The grey lumpy clouds were gone and instead chariots of
dazzling white bowled along the infinite blue expanse harnessed to the
southwest wind But above all the sparrows dragged straws to and fro
loudly chirruping All spring was indexed there

For a moment Michael was entranced with the exquisite moment and stood
sunning his soul in spring But then he felt the fetters of his own
individual winter heavy on him again and he could only see what was
happening without feeling it For that moment he had felt the leap in
his blood but the next he was conscious again of the immense
fatigue that for weeks had been growing on him The task which he had
voluntarily taken on himself had become no lighter with habit the
incessant attendance on his mother and the strain of it got heavier day
by day For some time now her childlike content in his presence had
been clouded and instead she was constantly depressed and constantly
querulous with him finding fault with his words and his silences and
in her confused and muffled manner blaming him and affixing sinister
motives to his most innocent actions But she was still entirely
dependent on him and if he left her for an hour or two she would wait
in an agony of anxiety for his return and when he came back overwhelmed
him with tearful caresses and the exaction of promises not to go away
again Then feeling certain of him once more she would start again on
complaints and reproaches Her doctor had warned him that it looked
as if some new phase of her illness was approaching which might
necessitate the complete curtailment of her liberty but day had
succeeded to day and she still remained in the same condition neither
better nor worse but making every moment a burden to Michael

It had been necessary that Sylvia should discontinue her visits for
some weeks ago Lady Ashbridge had suddenly taken a dislike to her and
when she came would sit in silent and lofty displeasure speaking to
her as little as possible and treating her with a chilling and awful
politeness Michael had enough influence with his mother to prevent her
telling the girl what her crime had been which was her refusal to
marry him but when he was alone with his mother he had to listen to
torrents of these complaints Lady Ashbridge with a wealth of language
that had lain dormant in her all her life sarcastically supposed that
Miss Falbe was a princess in disguise very impenetrable disguise for
Im sure she reminds me of a barmaid more than a princess and thought
that such a marriage would be beneath her Or another time she hinted
that Miss Falbe might be already married indeed this seemed a very
plausible explanation of her attitude She desired in fact that Sylvia
should not come to see her any more and now when she did not there
was scarcely a day in which Lady Ashbridge would not talk in a pointed
manner about pretended friends who leave you alone and wont even take
the trouble to take a twopenny bus if they are so poor as all that
to come from Chelsea to Curzon Street

Michael knew that his mothers steps were getting nearer and nearer to
that border line which separates the sane from the insane and with all
the wearing strain of the days as they passed had but the one desire
in his heart namely to keep her on the right side for as long as was
humanly possible But something might happen some new symptom develop
which would make it impossible for her to go on living with him as she
did now and the dread of that moment haunted his waking hours and his
dreams Two months ago her doctor had told him that for the sake of
everyone concerned it was to be hoped that the progress of her disease
would be swift but for his part Michael passionately disclaimed such
a wish In spite of her constant complaints and strictures she was
still possessed of her love for him and wearing though every day was
he grudged the passing of the hours that brought her nearer to the awful
boundary line Had a deed been presented to him for his signature which
bound him indefinitely to his mothers service on the condition that
she got no worse his pen would have spluttered with his eagerness to
sign

In consequence of his mothers dislike to Sylvia Michael had hardly
seen her during this last month Once when owing to some small physical
disturbance Lady Ashbridge had gone to bed early on a Sunday evening
he had gone to one of the Falbes weekly parties and had tried to fling
himself with enjoyment into the friendly welcoming atmosphere But for
the present he felt himself detached from it all for this life with
his mother was close round him with a sort of nightmare obsession
through which outside influence and desire could only faintly trickle
He knew that the other life was there he knew that in his heart he
longed for Sylvia as much as ever but in his present detachment his
desire for her was a drowsy ache a remote emptiness and the veil that
lay over his mother seemed to lie over him also Once indeed during
the evening when he had played for her the veil had lifted and for the
drowsy ache he had the sunlit stabbing pang but as he left the veil
dropped again and he let himself into the big mute house sorry that
he had left it In the same way too his music was in abeyance he
could not concentrate himself or find it worth while to make the effort
to absorb himself in it and he knew that short of that there was
neither profit nor pleasure for him in his piano Everything seemed
remote compared with the immediate foreground there was a gap a gulf
between it and all the rest of the world

His father wrote to him from time to time laying stress on the extreme
importance of all he was doing in the country and giving no hint of his
coming up to town at present But he faintly adumbrated the time when
in the natural course of events he would have to attend to his national
duties in the House of Lords and wondered whether it would not about
then be good for his wife to have a change and enjoy the country
when the weather became more propitious Michael with an excusable
unfilialness did not answer these amazing epistles but having basked
in their unconscious humour sent them on to Aunt Barbara Weekly
reports were sent by Lady Ashbridges nurse to his father and Michael
had nothing whatever to add to these His fear of him had given place
to a quiet contempt which he did not care to think about and certainly
did not care to express

Every now and then Lady Ashbridge had what Michael thought of as a good
hour or two when she went back to her content and childlike joy in his
presence and it was clear when presently she came downstairs as he
still lingered in the garden reading the daily paper in the sun that
one of these better intervals had visited her She too it appeared
felt the waving of the magic wand of spring and she noted the signs of
it with a joy that was infinitely pathetic

My dear she said what a beautiful morning Is it wise to sit out
of doors without your hat Michael Shall not I go and fetch it for you
No Then let us sit here and talk It is spring is it not Look how the
birds are collecting twigs for their nests I wonder how they know that
the time has come round again Sweet little birds How bold and merry
they are

She edged her way a little nearer him so that her shoulder leaned on
his arm

My dear I wish you were going to nest too she said I wonderdo
you think I have been illnatured and unkind to your Sylvia and that
makes her not come to see me now I do remember being vexed at her for
not wanting to marry you and perhaps I talked unkindly about her I am
sorry for my being cross to her will do no good it will only make
her more unwilling than ever to marry a man who has such an unpleasant
mamma Will she come to see me again do you think if I ask her

These good hours were too rare in their appearances and swift in their
vanishings to warrant the certainty that she would feel the same this
afternoon and Michael tried to turn the subject

Ah we shall have to think about that mother he said Look there
is a quarrel going on between those two sparrows They both want the
same straw

She followed his pointing finger easily diverted

Oh I wish they would not quarrel she said It is so sad and stupid
to quarrel instead of being agreeable and pleasant I do not like them
to do that There one has flown away And see the crocuses are coming
up Indeed it is spring I should like to see the country today If you
are not busy Michael would you take me out into the country We might
go to Richmond Park perhaps for that is in the opposite direction from
Ashbridge and look at the deer and the budding trees Oh Michael
might we take lunch with us and eat it out of doors I want to enjoy as
much as I can of this spring day

She clung closer to Michael

Everything seems so fragile dear she whispered Everything may
break    Sometimes I am frightened

The little expedition was soon moving after a slight altercation
between Lady Ashbridge and her nurse whom she wished to leave behind
in order to enjoy Michaels undiluted society But Miss Baker who had
already spoken to Michael telling him she was not quite happy in her
mind about her patient was firm about accompanying them though she
obligingly effaced herself as far as possible by taking the boxseat by
the chauffeur as they drove down and when they arrived and Michael
and his mother strolled about in the warm sunshine before lunch keeping
carefully in the background just ready to come if she was wanted But
indeed it seemed as if no such precautions were necessary for never had
Lady Ashbridge been more amenable more blissfully content in her sons
companionship The vernal hour that first smell of the rejuvenated
earth as it stirred and awoke from its winter sleep had reached her
no less than it had reached the springing grass and the heart of buried
bulbs and never perhaps in all her life had she been happier than on
that balmy morning of early March Here the stir of spring that had
crept across miles of smoky houses to the gardens behind Curzon Street
was more actively effervescent and the bare leafless choirs of the
trees which had been empty of song all winter were once more resonant
with feathered worshippers Through the tussocks of the grey grass of
last year were pricking the vivid shoots of green and over the grove
of young birches and hazel the dim purple veil of spring hung mistlike
Down by the wateredge of the Penn ponds they strayed where moorhens
scuttled out of rhododendron bushes that overhung the lake and hurried
across the surface of the water half swimming half flying for the
shelter of some securer retreat There too they found a plantation of
willows already in bud with soft moleskin buttons and a tortoiseshell
butterfly evoked by the sun from its hibernation settled on one of the
twigs opening and shutting its diapered wings and spreading them to
the warmth to thaw out the stiffness and inaction of winter Blackbirds
fluted in the busy thickets a lark shot up near them soaring and
singing till it became invisible in the luminous air a suspended
carol in the blue and bold male chaffinches seeking their mates with
twittered songs fluttered with burr of throbbing wings All the promise
of spring was theredim fragile but sure on this day of days
this pearl that emerged from the darkness and the stress of winter
iridescent with the tender colours of the dawning year

They lunched in the open motor Miss Baker again obligingly removing
herself to the box seat and spreading rugs on the grass sat in the
sunshine while Lady Ashbridge talked or silently watched Michael as he
smoked but always with a smile The one little note of sadness which
she had sounded when she said she was frightened lest everything should
break had not rung again and yet all day Michael heard it echoing
somewhere dimly behind the song of the wind and the birds and the
shoots of growing trees It lurked in the thickets just eluding him
and not presenting itself to his direct gaze but he felt that he saw it
out of the corner of his eye only to lose it when he looked at it And
yet for weeks his mother had never seemed so well the cloud had lifted
off her this morning and but for some vague presage of trouble that
somehow haunted his mind refusing to be disentangled he could have
believed that after all medical opinion might be at fault and that
instead of her passing more deeply into the shadows as he had been
warned was inevitable she might at least maintain the level to which
she had returned today All day she had been as she was before the
darkness and discontent of those last weeks had come upon her he
who knew her now so well could certainly have affirmed that she had
recovered the serenity of a month ago It was so much so tremendously
much that she should do this and if only she could remain as she had
been all day she would at any rate be happy happier perhaps than she
had consciously been in all the stifled years which had preceded this
Nothing else at the moment seemed to matter except the preservation to
her of such content and how eagerly would he have given all the service
that his young manhood had to offer if by that he could keep her
from going further into the bewildering darkness that he had been told
awaited her

There was some little trouble though no more than the shadow of a
passing cloud when at last he said that they must be getting back to
town for the afternoon was beginning to wane She besought him for five
minutes more of sitting here in the sunshine that was still warm and
when those minutes were over she begged for yet another postponement
But then the quiet imposition of his will suddenly conquered her and
she got up

My dear you shall do what you like with me she said for you have
given me such a happy day Will you remember that Michael It has been
a nice day And might we do you think ask Miss Falbe to come to tea
with us when we get back She can but say no and if she comes I will
be very good and not vex her

As she got back into the motor she stood up for a moment her vague blue
eyes scanning the sky the trees the stretch of sunlit park

Goodbye lake happy lake and moorhens she said Goodbye trees
and grass that are growing green again Goodbye all pretty peaceful
things


Michael had no hesitation in telephoning to Sylvia when they got back to
town asking her if she could come and have tea with his mother for the
gentle affectionate mood of the morning still lasted and her eagerness
to see Sylvia was only equalled by her eagerness to be agreeable to her
He was greedy whenever it could be done to secure a pleasure for his
mother and this one seemed in her present mood a perfectly safe one
Added to that impulse in itself sufficient there was his own longing
to see her again that thirst that never left him and soon after they
had got back to Curzon Street Sylvia was with them and as before
in preparation for a long visit she had taken off her hat Today she
divested herself of it without any suggestion on Lady Ashbridges part
and this immensely pleased her

Look Michael she said Miss Falbe means to stop a long time That
is sweet of her is it not She is not in such a hurry to get away
today Sugar Miss Falbe Yes I remember you take sugar and milk but
no cream Well I do think this is nice

Sylvia had seen neither mother nor son for a couple of weeks and her
eyes coming fresh to them noticed much change in them both In Lady
Ashbridge this change though marked was indefinable enough she seemed
to the girl to have somehow gone much further off than she had been
before she had faded become indistinct It was evident that she found
except when she was talking to Michael a far greater difficulty in
expressing herself the channels of communication as it were were
getting choked    With Michael the change was easily stated he
looked terribly tired and it was evident that the strain of these weeks
was telling heavily on him And yet as Sylvia noticed with a sudden
sense of personal pride in him not one jot of his patient tenderness
for his mother was abated Tired as he was nervous on edge whenever
he dealt with her either talking to her or watching for any little
attention she might need his face was alert with love But she noticed
that when the footman brought in tea and in arranging the cups let a
spoon slip jangling from its saucer Michael jumped as if a bomb had
gone off and under his breath said to the man You clumsy fool
Little as the incident was she knowing Michaels courtesy and
politeness found it significant as bearing on the evidence of his
tired face Then next moment his mother said something to him and
instantly his love transformed and irradiated it

Today more than ever before Lady Ashbridge seemed to exist only
through him As Sylvia knew she had been for the last few weeks
constantly disagreeable to him but she wondered whether this exacting
meticulous affection was not harder to bear Yet Michael in spite of
the nervous strain which now showed itself so clearly seemed to find no
difficulty at all in responding to it It might have worn his nerves to
tatters but the tenderness and love of him passed unhampered through
the frayed communications for it was he himself who was brought into
play It was of that Michael now more and more triumphantly revealed
that Sylvia felt so proud as if he had been a possession an
achievement wholly personal to her He was her Michaelit was just that
which was becoming evident since nothing else would account for her
claim of him unconsciously whispered by herself to herself

It was not long before Lady Ashbridges nurse appeared to take her
upstairs to rest At that her patient became suddenly and unaccountably
agitated all the happy content of the day was wiped off her mind She
clung to Michael

No no Michael she said they mustnt take me away I know they are
going to take me away from you altogether You mustnt leave me

Nurse Baker came towards her

Now my lady you mustnt behave like that she said You know you
are only going upstairs to rest as usual before dinner You will see
Lord Comber again then

She shrank from her shielding herself behind Michaels shoulder

No Michael no she repeated Im going to be taken away from you
And look Missah my dear I have forgotten your namelook she has
got no hat on She was going to stop with me a long time Michael must
I go

Michael saw the nurse looking at her watching her with that quiet eye
of the trained attendant

Then she spoke to Michael

Well if Lord Comber will just step outside with me she said well
see if we can arrange for you to stop a little longer

And youll come back Michael said she

Michael saw that the nurse wanted to say something to him and with
infinite gentleness disentangled the clinging of Lady Ashbridges hand

Why of course I will he said And wont you give Miss Falbe another
cup of tea

Lady Ashbridge hesitated a moment

Yes Ill do that she said And by the time Ive done that you will
be back again wont you

Michael followed the nurse from the room who closed the door without
shutting it

Theres something I dont like about her this evening she said All
day I have been rather anxious She must be watched very carefully Now
I want you to get her to come upstairs and Ill try to make her go to
bed

Michael felt his mouth go suddenly dry

What do you expect he said

I dont expect anything but we must be prepared A change comes very
quickly

Michael nodded and they went back together

Now mother darling he said up you go with Nurse Baker Youve been
out all day and you must have a good rest before dinner Shall I come
up and see you soon

A curious sly look came into Lady Ashbridges face

Yes but where am I going to she said How do I know Nurse Baker
will take me to my own room

Because I promise you she will said Michael

That instantly reassured her Mood after mood as Michael saw were
passing like shadows over her mind

Ah thats enough she said Goodbye Missthere the names gone
again But wont you sit here and have a talk to Michael and let him
show you over the house to see if you like it against the timeOh
Michael said I mustnt worry you about that And wont you stop and have
dinner with us and afterwards we can sing

Michael put his arm around her

Well talk about that while youre resting he said Dont keep Nurse
Baker waiting any longer mother

She nodded and smiled

No no mustnt keep anybody waiting she said Your father taught me
to be punctual

When they had left the room together Sylvia turned to Michael

Michael my dear she said I think you arewell I think you are
Michael

She saw that at the moment he was not thinking of her at all and her
heart honoured him for that

Im anxious about my mother tonight he said She has been soI
suppose you must call itwell all day but the nurse isnt easy about
her

Suddenly all his fears and his fatigue and his trouble looked out of his
eyes

Im frightened he said and its so unutterably feeble of me And
Im tired you dont know how tired and try as I may I feel that all
the time it is no use My mother is slipping slipping away

But my dear no wonder you are tired she said Michael cant
anybody help It isnt right you should do everything

He shook his head smiling

They cant help he said Im the only person who can help her And
I

He stood up bracing mind and body

And Im so brutally proud of it he said She wants me Well thats
a lot for a son to be able to say Sylvia I would give anything to keep
her

Still he was not thinking of her and knowing that she came close
to him and put her arm in his She longed to give him some feeling of
comradeship She could be sisterly to him over this without suggesting
to him what she could not be to him Her instinct had divined right
and she felt the answering pressure of his elbow that acknowledged her
sympathy welcomed it and thought no more about it

You are giving everything to keep her she said You are giving
yourself What further gift is there Michael

He kept her arm close pressed by him and she knew by the frankness of
that holding caress he was thinking of her still either not at all or
she hoped as a comrade who could perhaps be of assistance to courage
and clearsightedness in difficult hours She wanted to be no more than
that to him just now it was the most she could do for him but with
a desire the most acute she had ever felt for him she wanted him to
accept thatto take her comradeship as he would have surely taken her
brothers Once in the last intimate moments they had had together he
had refused to accept that attitude from herhad felt it a relationship
altogether impossible She had seen his point of view and recognised
the justice of the embarrassment Now very simply but very eagerly
she hoped as with some tugging strain that he would not reject it She
knew she had missed this brother who had refused to be brother to her
But he had been about his own business and he had been doing his own
business with a quiet splendour that drew her eyes to him and as they
stood there thus linked she wondered if her heart was following   
She had seen last December how reasonable it was of him to refuse this
domestic sort of intimacy with her now she found herself intensely
longing that he would not persist in his refusal

Suddenly Michael awoke to the fact of her presence and abruptly he
moved away from her

Thanks Sylvia he said I know I have youryour good wishes
Butwell I am sure you understand

She understood perfectly well And the understanding of it cut her to
the quick

Have you got any right to behave like that to me Michael she asked
What have I done that you should treat me quite like that

He looked at her completely recalled in mind to her alone All the
hopes and desires of the autumn smote him with encompassing blows

Yes every right he said I wasnt heeding you I only thought of my
mother and the fact that there was a very dear friend by me And then I
came to myself I remembered who the friend was

They stood there in silence apart for a moment Then Michael came
closer The desire for human sympathy and that the sympathy he most
longed for gripped him again

Im a brute he said It was awfully nice of you toto offer me
that I accept it so gladly Im wretchedly anxious

He looked up at her

Take my arm again he said

She felt the crook of his elbow tighten again on her wrist She had not
known before how much she prized that

But are you sure you are right in being anxious Mike she asked
Isnt it perhaps your own tired nerves that make you anxious

I dont think so he said Ive been tired a long time you see
and I never felt about my mother like this She has been so bright and
content all day and yet there were little lapses if you understand
It was as if she knew she said goodbye to the lake and the jolly
moorhens and the grass And her nurse thinks so too She called me out
of the room just now to tell me that    I dont know why I should
tell you these depressing things

Dont you she asked But I do Its because you know I care
Otherwise you wouldnt tell me you couldnt

For a moment the balance quavered in his mind between Sylvia the beloved
and Sylvia the friend It inclined to the friend

Yes thats why he said And I reproach myself you know All these
years I might if I had tried harder have been something to my mother
I might have managed it I thoughtat least I feltthat she didnt
encourage me But I was a beast to have been discouraged And now her
wanting me has come just when it isnt her unclouded self that wants me
Its as ifas if it had been raining all day and just on sunset there
comes a gleam in the west And so soon after its night

You made the gleam said Sylvia

But so late so awfully late

Suddenly he stood stiff listening to some sound which at present
she did not hear It sounded a little louder and her ears caught the
running of footsteps on the stairs outside Next moment the door opened
and Lady Ashbridges maid put in a pale face

Will you go to her ladyship my lord she said Her nurse wants you
She told me to telephone to Sir James

Sylvia moved with him not disengaging her arm towards the door

Michael may I wait she said You might want me you know Please
let me wait


Lady Ashbridges room was on the floor above and Michael ran up the
intervening stairs three at a time He knocked and entered and wondered
why he had been sent for for she was sitting quietly on her sofa near
the window But he noticed that Nurse Baker stood very close to her
Otherwise there was nothing that was in any way out of the ordinary

And here he is said the nurse reassuringly as he entered

Lady Ashbridge turned towards the door as Michael came in and when he
met her eyes he knew why he had been sent for why at this moment Sir
James was being summoned For she looked at him not with the clouded
eyes of affection not with the motherspirit striving to break
through the shrouding trouble of her brain but with eyes of blank
nonrecognition She saw him with the bodily organs of her vision
but the picture of him was conveyed no further there was a blank wall
behind her eyes

Michael did not hesitate It was possible that he still might be
something to her that he his presence might penetrate

But you are not resting mother he said Why are you sitting up I
came to talk to you as I said I would while you rested

Suddenly into those blank irresponsive eyes there leaped recognition
He saw the pupils contract as they focused themselves on him and hand
in hand with recognition there leaped into them hate Instantly that
was veiled again But it had been there and now it was not banished it
lurked behind in the shadows crouching and waiting

She answered him at once but in a voice that was quite toneless It
seemed like that of a child repeating a lesson which it had learned by
heart and could be pronounced while it was thinking of something quite
different

I was waiting till you came my dear she said Now I will lie down
Come and sit by me Michael

She watched him narrowly while she spoke then gave a quick glance at
her nurse as if to see that they were not making signals to each other
There was an easy chair just behind her head and as Michael wheeled it
up near her sofa he looked at the nurse She moved her hand slightly
towards the left and interpreting this he moved the chair a little to
the left so that he would not sit as he had intended quite close to
the sofa

And you enjoyed your day in the country mother asked Michael

She looked at him sideways and slowly Then again as if recollecting a
task she had committed to memory she answered

Yes so much she said All the trees and the birds and the sunshine
I enjoyed them so much

She paused a moment

Bring your chair a little closer my darling she said You are so
far off And why do you wait nurse I will call you if I want you

Michael felt one moment of sickening spiritual terror He understood
quite plainly why Nurse Baker did not want him to go near to his mother
and the reason of it gave him this pang not of nervousness but of black
horror that the sane and the sensitive must always feel when they are
brought intimately in contact with some blind derangement of instinct in
those most nearly allied to them Physically on the material plane he
had no fear at all

He made a movement grasping the arm of his chair as if to wheel it
closer but he came actually no nearer her

Why dont you go away nurse said Lady Ashbridge and leave my son
and me to talk about our nice day in the country

Nurse Baker answered quite naturally

I want to talk too my lady she said I went with you and Lord
Comber We all enjoyed it together

It seemed to Michael that his mother made some violent effort towards
selfcontrol He saw one of her hands that were lying on her knee clench
itself so that the knuckles stood out white

Yes we will all talk together then she said Orershall I have
a little doze first I am rather sleepy with so much pleasant air And
you are sleepy too are you not Michael Yes I see you look sleepy
Shall we have a little nap as I often do after tea Then when I am
fresh again you shall come back nurse and we will talk over our
pleasant day

When he entered the room Michael had not quite closed the door and
now as half an hour before he heard steps on the stairs A moment
afterwards his mother heard them too

What is that she said Who is coming now to disturb me just when I
wanted to have a nap

There came a knock at the door Nurse Baker did not move her head but
continued watching her patient with hands ready to act

Come in she said not looking round

Lady Ashbridges face was towards the door As Sir James entered she
suddenly sprang up and in her right hand that lay beside her was a
knife which she had no doubt taken from the teatable when she came
upstairs She turned swiftly towards Michael and stabbed at him with
it

Its a trap she cried Youve led me into a trap They are going to
take me away

Michael had thrown up his arm to shield his head The blow fell between
shoulder and elbow and he felt the edge of the knife grate on his bone

And from deep in his heart sprang the leaping fountains of compassion
and love and yearning pity


CHAPTER XII


Michael was sitting in the big studio at the Falbes house late
one afternoon at the end of June and the warmth and murmur of the
fullblown summer filled the air The day had so far declined that the
rays of the sun level in its setting poured slantingly in through
the big window to the north and shining through the foliage of the
planetrees outside made a diaper of rosy illuminated spots and angled
shadows on the whitewashed wall As the leaves stirred in the evening
breeze this pattern shifted and twinkled now as the wind blew aside a
bunch of foliage a lake of rosy gold would spring up on the wall then
as the breath of movement died the green shadows grew thicker again
faintly stirring Through the window to the south which Hermann had
caused to be cut there since the studio was not used for painting
purposes Michael could see into the patch of highwalled garden where
Mrs Falbe was sitting in a low basket chair completely absorbed in a
book of highborn and ludicrous adventures She had made a mild attempt
when she found that Michael intended to wait for Sylvias return to
entertain him till she came but with a little oblique encouragement
remarking on the beauty and warmth of the evening and the pleasure of
sitting out of doors Michael had induced her to go out again and leave
him alone in the studio free to live over again that which twentyfour
hours ago had changed life for him

He reconstructed it as he sat on the sofa and dwelt on the pearlmoments
of it Just this time yesterday he had come in and found Sylvia alone
She had got up he remembered to give him greeting and just opposite
the fireplace they had come face to face She held in her hand a small
white rose which she had plucked in the tiny garden here in the middle
of London It was not a very fine specimen but it was a rose and she
had said in answer to his depreciatory glance But you must see it when
I have washed it One has to wash London flowers

Then    the miracle happened Michael with the hand that had just
taken hers stroked a petal of this prized vegetable with no thought in
his mind stronger than the thoughts that had been indigenous there since
Christmas As his finger first touched the rim of the townbred petals
undersized yet not quite lacking in rosequality he had intended
nothing more than to salute the flower as Sylvia made her apology for
it One has to wash London flowers But as he touched it he looked
up at her and the quiet usual song of his thoughts towards her grew
suddenly loud and stupefyingly sweet It was as if from the vacant
hivedoor the bees swarmed In her eyes as they met his he thought
he saw an expectancy a welcome and his hand instead of stroking the
rosepetals closed on the rose and on the hand that held it and kept
them close imprisoned and strongly gripped He could not remember if he
had spoken any word but he had seen that in her face which rendered all
speech unnecessary and knowing in the bones and the blood of him that
he was right he kissed her And then she had said Yes Michael

His hand still was tight on hers that held the crumpled rose and when
he opened it loverlike to stroke and kiss it there was a spot of
blood in the palm of it where a rosethorn had pricked her just one
drop of Sylvias blood As he kissed it he had wiped it away with
the tip of his tongue between his lips and she smiling had said Oh
Michael how silly

They had sat together on the sofa where this afternoon he sat alone
waiting for her Every moment of that half hour was as distinct as the
outline of trees and hills just before a storm and yet it was still
entirely dreamlike He knew it had happened for nothing but the
happening of it would account now for the fact of himself but though
there was nothing in the world so true there was nothing so incredible
Yet it was all as cleancut in his mind as etched lines and round
each line sprang flowers and singing birds For a long space there was
silence after they had sat down and then she said I think I always
loved you Michael only I didnt know it    Thereafter foolish
love talk he had claimed a superiority there for he had always loved
her and had always known it Much time had been wasted owing to her
ignorance    she ought to have known But all the time that existed
was theirs now In all the world there was no more time than what they
had The crumpled rose had its petals rehabilitated the thorn that had
pricked her was peeled off They wondered if Hermann had come in yet
Then by some vague process of locomotion they found themselves at
the piano and with her arm around his neck Sylvia has whispered half a
verse of the song of herself   

They became a little more definite over loverconfessions Michael had
so to speak nothing to confess he had loved all alonghe had wanted
her all along there never had been the least pretence or nonsense about
it Her path was a little more difficult to trace but once it had been
traversed it was clear enough She had liked him always she had felt
sisterlike from the moment when Hermann brought him to the house and
sisterlike she had continued to feel even when Michael had definitely
declared there was no thoroughfare there She had missed that
relationship when it stopped she did not mind telling him that now
since it was abandoned by them both but not for the world would she
have confessed before that she had missed it She had loved being asked
to come and see his mother and it was during those visits that she had
helped to pile the barricade across the sisterthoroughfare with her
own hands She began to share Michaels sense of the impossibility of
that road They could not walk down it together for they had to be
either more or less to each other than that And during these visits
she had begun to understand and her face a little hid itself what
Michaels love meant She saw it manifested towards his mother she was
taught by it she learned it and she supposed she loved it Anyhow
having seen it she could not want Michael as a brother any longer and
if he still wanted anything else she supposed so she supposed that
some time he would mention that fact Yes she began to hope that he
would not be very long about it   


Michael went over this very deliberately as he sat waiting for her
twentyfour hours later He rehearsed this moment and that over and over
again in mind he followed himself and Sylvia across to the piano not
hurrying their steps and going through the verse of the song she
sang at the pace at which she actually sang it And as he dreamed and
recollected he heard a little stir in the quiet house and Sylvia came

They met just as they met yesterday in front of the fireplace

Oh Michael have you been waiting long she said

Yes hours or perhaps a couple of minutes I dont know

Ah but which If hours I shall apologise and then excuse myself by
saying that you must have come earlier than you intended If minutes I
shall praise myself for being so exceedingly punctual

Minutes then said he Ill praise you instead Praise is more
convincing if somebody else does it

Yes but you arent somebody else Now be sensible Have you done all
the things you told me you were going to do

Yes

Sylvia released her hands from his

Tell me then she said Youve seen your father

There was no cloud on Michaels face There was such sunlight where his
soul sat that no shadow could fall across it

Oh yes I saw him he said

He captured Sylvias hand again

And what is more he saw me so to speak he said He realised that I
had an existence independent of him I used to be aa sort of clock to
him he could put its hands to point to any hour he chose Well he has
realisedhe has reallythat I am ticking along on my own account
He was quite respectful not only to me which doesnt matter but to
youwhich does Michael laughed as he plaited his fingers in with
hers

My father is so comic he said and unlike most great humourists his
humour is absolutely unconscious He was perfectly well aware that I
meant to marry you for I told him that last Christmas adding that you
did not mean to marry me So since then I think hes got used to you
Used to youfancy getting used to you

Especially since he had never seen me said the girl

That makes it less odd Getting used to you after seeing you would be
much more incredible I was saying that in a way he had got used to
you just as hes got used to my being a person and not a clock on his
chimneypiece and what seems to have made so much difference is what
Aunt Barbara told him last night namely that your mother was a Tracy
Sylvia dont let it be too much for you but in a certain faraway
manner he realises that you are one of us Isnt he a comic Hes
going to make the best of you it appears To make the best of you You
cant beat that you know In fact he told me to ask if he might come
and pay his respects to your mother tomorrow

And what about my singing my career she asked

Michael laughed again

He was funny about that also he said My father took it absolutely
for granted that having made this tremendous social advance you
would bury your past all but the Tracy part of it as if it had
been something disgraceful which the exalted Comber family agreed to
overlook

And what did you say

I Oh I told him that of course you would do as you pleased about
that but that for my part I should urge you most strongly to do nothing
of the kind

And he

He got four inches taller What is so odd is that as long as I never
opposed my fathers wishes as long as I was the clock on the chimney
piece I was terrified at him The thought of opposing myself to him
made my knees quake But the moment I began doing so I found there was
nothing to be frightened at

Sylvia got up and began walking up and down the long room

But what am I to do about it Michael she asked Oh I blush when
I think of a conversation I had with Hermann about you just before
Christmas when I knew you were going to propose to me I said that I
could never give up my singing Can you picture the selfimportance of
that Why it doesnt seem to me to matter two straws whether I do
or not Naturally I dont want to earn my living by it any more but
whether I sing or not doesnt matter And even as the words are in my
mouth I try to imagine myself not singing any more and I cant Its
become part of me and while I blush to think of what I said to Hermann
I wonder whether its not true

She came and sat down by him again

I believe you have got enough artistic instinct to understand that
Michael she said and to know what a tremendous help it is to ones
art to be a professional and to be judged seriously I suppose that
ideally if one loves music as I do one ought to be able to do ones
very best whether one is singing professionally or not but it
is hardly possible Why the whole difference between amateurs and
professionals is that amateurs sing charmingly and professionals just
sing Only they sing as well as they possibly can not only because they
love it but because if they dont they will be dropped on to and if
they continue not singing their best will lose their place which they
have so hardly won I can see myself perhaps not singing at all
literally never opening my lips in song again but I cant see myself
coming down to the Drill Hall at Brixton extremely beautifully
dressed with rows of pearls and arriving rather late and just singing
charmingly Its such a spur to know that serious musicians judge ones
performance by the highest possible standard Its so relaxing to think
that one can easily sing well enough that one can delight ninetynine
hundredths of the audience without any real effort I could sing The
Lost Chord and move the whole Drill Hall at Brixton to tears But there
might be one man there who knew you or Hermann or some other and at
the end he would just shrug his shoulders ever so slightly and I would
wish I had never been born

She paused a moment

Ill not sing any more at all ever she said or I must sing to
those who will take me seriously and judge me ruthlessly To sing just
well enough to please isnt possible Ill do either you like

Mrs Falbe strayed in at this moment with her finger in her book but
otherwise as purposeless as a wandering mist

I was afraid it might be going to get chilly she remarked After a
hot day there is often a cool evening Will you stop and dine LordI
mean Michael

Please certainly said Michael

Then I hope there will be something for you to eat Sylvia is there
something to eat No doubt you will see to that darling I shall just
rest upstairs for a little before dinner and perhaps finish my book So
pleased you are stopping

She drifted towards the studio door in thistledown fashion catching at
corners a little and then moving smoothly on again talking gently half
to herself half to the others

And Hermanns not in yet but if LordI mean Michael is going to
stop here till dinnertime it wont matter whether Hermann comes in in
time to dress or not as Michael is not dressed either Oh there is the
postmans knock What a noise I am not expecting any letters

The knock in question however proved to be Hermann who as was
generally the case had forgotten his latchkey He ran into his mother
at the studio door and came and sat down regardless of whether he was
wanted or not between the two on the sofa and took an arm of each

I probably intrude he said but such is my intention Ive just seen
Lady Barbara who says that the shock has not been too much for Mikes
father That is a good thing she says he is taking nourishment much as
usual I suppose I oughtnt to jest on so serious a subject but I
took my cue from Lady Barbara It appears that we have blue blood too
Sylvia and we must behave more like aristocrats A Tracy in the time
of King John flirted if no more with a Comber And what about your
career Sylvia Are you going to continue to urge your wild career
or not I ask with a purpose as Blackiston proposes we should give a
concert together in the third week in July The Queens Hall is vacant
one afternoon and he thinks we might sing and play to them Im on if
you are It will be about the last concert of the season too so we
shall have to do our best Otherwise we or I anyhow will start again
in the autumn with a black mark By the way are you going to start
again in the autumn It wouldnt surprise me one bit to hear that you
and Mike had been talking about just that

Dont be too clever to live Hermann said Sylvia

I dont propose to die if you mean that Oh Blackiston had another
suggestion also He wanted to know if we would consider making a short
tour in Germany in the autumn He says that the beloved Fatherland is
rather disposed to be interested in us He thinks we should have
good audiences at Leipzig and so on Theres a tendency he says to
recognise poor England a cordial intention anyhow I said that in your
case there might be domestic considerations whichBut I think I shall
go in any case Lord fancy playing in Germany to Germans again Fancy
being listened to by a German audience fancy if they approved

Michael leaned forward putting his elbow into Hermanns chest Early
December had already been mentioned as a date for their marriage and as
a prenuptial journey this seemed to him a plan ecstatically ideal

Yes Sylvia he said The answer is yes I shall come with you you
know I can see it a triumphal procession you two making noises and
me listening A months tour Hermann Middle of October till middle of
November Yes yes

All his tremendous pride in her singing dormant for the moment under
the wonder of his love rose to the surface He knew what her singing
meant to her and from their conversation together just now how keen
was her eagerness for the strict judgment of those who knew how she
loved that austere pinnacle of daylight Here was an ideal opportunity
never yet since she had won her place as a singer had she sung in
Germany that Mecca of the musical artist and in her case the land
from which she sprung Had the scheme implied a postponement of their
marriage he would still have declared himself for it for he unerringly
felt for her in this he knew intuitively what delicious beckoning this
held for her

Yes yes he repeated I must have you do that Sylvia I dont care
what Hermann wants or what you want I want it

Yes but whos to do the playing and the singing asked Hermann
Isnt it a question perhaps for

Michael felt quite secure about the feelings of the other two and
rudely interrupted

No he said Its a question for me When the Fatherland hears that
I am there it will no doubt ask me to play and sing instead of you two
Lord Fancy marrying into such a distinguished family I burst with
pride

It required then little debate since all three were agreed before
Hermann was empowered with authority to make arrangements and they
remained simultaneously talking till Mrs Falbe again drifting in
announced that the bell for dinner had sounded some minutes before She
had her finger in the last chapter of Lady Ursulas Ordeal and laid
it face downwards on the table to resume again at the earliest possible
moment This opportunity was granted her when at the close of dinner
coffee and the evening paper came in together This Hermann opened at
the middle page

Hallo he said Thats horrible The Heir Apparent of the Austrian
Emperor has been murdered at Serajevo Servian plot apparently

Oh what a dreadful thing said Mrs Falbe opening her book Poor
man what had he done

Hermann took a cigarette frowning

It may be a match he began

Mrs Falbe diverted her attention from Lady Ursula for a moment

They are on the chimneypiece dear she said thinking he spoke of
material matches

Michael felt that Hermann saw something or conjectured something
ominous in this news for he sat with knitted brow reading and letting
the match burn down

Yes it seems that Servian officers are implicated he said And
there are materials enough already for a row between Austria and Servia
without this

Those tiresome Balkan States said Mrs Falbe slowly immersing
herself like a diving submarine in her book They are always
quarrelling Why doesnt Austria conquer them all and have done with
it

This simple and striking solution of the whole Balkan question was
her final contribution to the topic for at this moment she became
completely submerged and cut off so to speak from the outer world in
the lucent depths of Lady Ursula

Hermann glanced through the other pages and let the paper slide to the
floor

What will Austria do he said Supposing she threatens Servia in some
outrageous way and Russia says she wont stand it What then

Michael looked across to Sylvia he was much more interested in the way
she dabbled the tips of her hands in the cool water of her finger bowl
than in what Hermann was saying Her fingers had an extraordinary life
of their own just now they were like a group of maidens by a fountain
   But Hermann repeated the question to him personally

Oh I suppose there will be a lot of telegraphing he said and
perhaps a board of arbitration After all one expected a European
conflagration over the war in the Balkan States and again over their
row with Turkey I dont believe in European conflagrations We are all
too much afraid of each other We walk round each other like collie dogs
on the tips of their toes gently growling and then quietly get back to
our own territories and lie down again

Hermann laughed

Thank God theres that wonderful fireengine in Germany ready to turn
the hose on conflagrations

What fireengine asked Michael

The Emperor of course We should have been at war ten times over but
for him

Sylvia dried her fingertips one by one

Lady Barbara doesnt quite take that view of him does she Mike she
asked

Michael suddenly remembered how one night in the flat Aunt Barbara had
suddenly turned the conversation from the discussion of cognate topics
on hearing that the Falbes were Germans only to resume it again when
they had gone

I dont fancy she does he said But then as you know Aunt Barbara
has original views on every subject

Hermann did not take the possible hint here conveyed to drop the matter

Well then what do you think about him he asked

Michael laughed

My dear Hermann he said how often have you told me that we English
dont pay the smallest attention to international politics I am aware
that I dont I know nothing whatever about them

Hermann shook off the cloud of preoccupation that so unaccountably
to Michaels thinking had descended on him and walked across to the
window

Well long may ignorance be bliss he said Lord what a divine
evening Uber allen gipfeln ist Ruhe At least there is peace on the
only summits visible which are house roofs Theres not a breath of
wind in the trees and chimneypots and its hot its really hot

I was afraid there was going to be a chill at sunset remarked Mrs
Falbe subaqueously

Then you were afraid even where no fear was mother darling said he
and if you would like to sit out in the garden Ill take a chair out
for you and a table and candles Lets all sit out its a divine hour
this hour after sunset There are but a score of days in the whole year
when the hour after sunset is warm like this Its such a pity to
waste one indoors The young peopleand he pointed to Sylvia and
Michaelwill gaze into each others hearts and Mammas will beat in
unison with Lady Ursulas and I will sit and look at the sky and become
profoundly sentimental like a good German

Hermann and Michael bestirred themselves and presently the whole little
party had encamped on chairs placed in an oasis of rugs this was done
at the special request of Mrs Falbe since Lady Ursula had caught a
chill that developed into consumption in the small highwalled garden
Beyond at the bottom lay the road along the embankment and the greyblue
Thames and the dim woods of Battersea Park across the river When they
came out sparrows were still chirping in the ivy on the studio wall
and in the tall angleleaved planes at the bottom of the little plot
discussing no doubt the domestic arrangements for their comfort
during the night But presently a sudden hush fell upon them and their
shrillness was sharp no more against the drowsy hum of the city The
sky overhead was of veiled blue growing gradually more toneless as the
light faded and was unflecked by any cloud except where high in the
zenith a fleece of rosy vapour still caught the light of the sunken
sun and flamed with the soft radiance of some snowsummit Near it
there burned a molten planet growing momentarily brighter as the night
gathered and presently beginning to be dimmed again as a tawny moon
three days past the full rose in the east above the low river horizon
Occasionally a steamer hooted from the Thames and the noise of churned
waters sounded or the crunch of a motors wheels or the tapping of
the heels of a foot passenger on the pavement below the garden wall But
such evidence of outside seemed but to accentuate the perfect peace of
this secluded little garden where the four sat the hour and the place
were cut off from all turmoil and activities for a moment the stream
of all their lives had flowed into a backwater where it rested immobile
before the travel that was yet to come So it seemed to Michael then
and so years afterwards it seemed to him as vividly as on this evening
when the tawny moon grew golden as it climbed the empty heavens dimming
the stars around it

What they talked of even though it was Sylvia who spoke seemed
external to the spirit of the hour They seemed to have reached a point
some momentary haltingplace where speech and thought even lay outside
and the need of the spirit was merely to exist and be conscious of
its existence Sometimes for a moment his past life with its
selfrepression its mute yearnings its chrysalis stirrings formed a
mist that dispersed again sometimes for a moment in wonder at what
the future held what joys and troubles what achings perhaps and
anguishes the unknown knocked stealthily at the door of his mind but
then stole away unanswered and unwelcome and for that hour while Mrs
Falbe finished with Lady Ursula while Hermann smoked and sighed like a
sentimental German and while he and Sylvia sat speaking occasionally
but more often silent he was in some kind of Nirvana for which its own
existence was everything Movement had ceased he held his breath while
that divine pause lasted

When it was broken there was no shattering of it it simply died away
like a longdrawn chord as Mrs Falbe closed her book

She died she said I knew she would

Hermann gave a great shout of laughter

Darling mother Im ever so much obliged he said We had to return
to earth somehow Where has everybody else been

Michael stirred in his chair

Ive been here he said

How dull Oh I suppose thats not polite to Sylvia Ive been in
Leipzig and in Frankfort and in Munich You and Sylvia have been there
too I may tell you But Ive also been here its jolly here

His sentimentalism had apparently not quite passed from him

Ah weve stolen this hour he said Weve taken it out of the
hurlyburly and had it to ourselves Its been ripping But Im back
from the rim of the world Oh Ive been there too and looked out over
the immortal sea Lieber Gott what a sea where we all come from and
where we all go to Were just playing on the sand where the waves have
cast us up for one little hour Oh the pleasant warm sand and the play
How I love it

He got out of his chair stretching himself as Mrs Falbe passed into
the house and gave a hand on each side to Michael and Sylvia

Ah it was a good thing I just caught that train at Victoria nearly
a year ago he said If I had been five seconds later I should have
missed it and so I should have missed my friend and Sylvia would have
missed hers and Mike would have missed his As it is here we all are
Behold the last remnant of my German sentimentality evaporates but I am
filled with a German desire for beer Let us come into the studio liebe
Kinder and have beer and music and laughter We cannot recapture this
hour or prolong it But it was good oh so good I thank God for this
hour

Sylvia put her hand on her brothers arm looking at him with just a
shade of anxiety

Nothing wrong Hermann she asked

Wrong There is nothing wrong unless it is wrong to be happy But we
have to go forward my only quarrel with life is that I would stop it
now if I could so that time should not run on and we should stay just
as we are Ah what does the future hold I am glad I do not know

Sylvia laughed

The immediate future holds beer apparently she said It also hold
a great deal of work for you and me if it is to hold Leipzig and
Frankfort and Munich Oh Hermann what glorious days

They walked together into the studio and as they entered Hermann looked
back over her into the dim garden Then he pulled down the blind with a
rattle

Move on there said the policeman he remarked And so they moved
on


The news about the murder of the Austrian Grand Duke which for that
moment at dinner had caused Hermann to peer with apprehension into the
veil of the future was taken quietly enough by the public in general in
England It was a nasty incident no doubt and the murder having been
committed on Servian soil the pundits of the Press gave themselves
an opportunity for subsequently saying that they were right by
conjecturing that Austria might insist on a strict inquiry into the
circumstances and the due punishment of not only the actual culprits
but of those also who perhaps were privy to the plot But three days
afterwards there was but little uneasiness the Stock Exchanges of
the European capitalsthose highly sensitive barometers of coming
stormwere but slightly affected for the moment and within a week
had steadied themselves again From Austria there came no sign of any
unreasonable demand which might lead to trouble with Servia and so with
Slavonic feeling generally and by degrees that threatening of storm
that sudden lightning on the horizon passed out of the mind of the
public There had been that one flash no more and even that had not
been answered by any growl of thunder the storm did not at once move
up and the heavens above were still clear and sunny by day and
starrykirtled at night But here and there were those who like Hermann
on the first announcement of the catastrophe scented trouble and
Michael going to see Aunt Barbara one afternoon early in the second
week of July found that she was one of them

I distrust it all my dear she said to him I am full of uneasiness
And what makes me more uneasy is that they are taking it so quietly
at the Austrian Embassy and at the German I dined at one Embassy
last night and at the other only a few nights ago and I cant get
anybodynot even the most indiscreet of the Secretariesto say a word
about it

But perhaps there isnt a word to be said suggested Michael

I cant believe that Austria cannot possibly let an incident of that
sort pass There is mischief brewing If she was merely intending to
insistas she has every right to doon an inquiry being held that
should satisfy reasonable demands for justice she would have insisted
on that long ago But a fortnight has passed now and still she makes
no sign I feel sure that something is being arranged Dear me I quite
forgot Tony asked me not to talk about it But it doesnt matter with
you

But what do you mean by something being arranged asked Michael

She looked round as if to assure herself that she and Michael were
alone

I mean this that Austria is being persuaded to make some outrageous
demand some demand that no independent country could possibly grant

But who is persuading her asked Michael

My dear youlike all the rest of Englandare fast asleep Who but
Germany and that dangerous monomaniac who rules Germany She has long
been wanting war and she has only been delaying the dawning of Der Tag
till all her preparations were complete and she was ready to hurl her
armies and her fleet too east and west and north Mark my words She
is about ready now and I believe she is going to take advantage of her
opportunity

She leaned forward in her chair

It is such an opportunity as has never occurred before she said and
in a hundred years none so fit may occur again Here are weEnglandon
the brink of civil war with Ireland and the Home Rulers our hands are
tied or rather are occupied with our own troubles Anyhow Germany
thinks so that I know for a fact among so much that is only conjecture
And perhaps she is right Who knows whether she may not be right and
that if she forces on war whether we shall range ourselves with our
allies

Michael laughed

But arent you piling up a European conflagration rather in a hurry
Aunt Barbara he asked

There will be hurry enough for us for France and Russia and perhaps
England but not for Germany She is never in a hurry she waits till
she is ready

A servant brought in tea and Lady Barbara waited till he had left the
room again

It is as simple as an addition sum she said if you grant the first
step that Austria is going to make some outrageous demand of
Servia What follows Servia refuses that demand and Austria begins
mobilisation in order to enforce it Servia appeals to Russia
invokes the bond of blood and Russia remonstrates with Austria Her
representations will be of no use you may stake all you have on that
and eventually since she will be unable to draw back she too will
begin in her slow cumbrous manner hampered by those immense distances
and her imperfect railway system to mobilise also Then will Germany
already quite prepared show her hand She will demand that Russia shall
cease mobilisation and again will Russia refuse That will set the
military machinery of France going All the time the governments of
Europe will be working for peace all that is except one which is
situated at Berlin

Michael felt inclined to laugh at this rapid and disastrous sequence of
ominous forebodings it was so completely characteristic of Aunt Barbara
to take the most violent possible view of the situation which no doubt
had its dangers And what Michael felt was felt by the enormous majority
of English people

Dear Aunt Barbara you do get on quick he said

It will happen quickly she said There is that little cloud in the
east like a mans hand today and rather like that mailed fist which
our sweet peaceful friend in Germany is so fond of talking about But it
will spread over the sky I tell you like some tropical storm France
is unready Russia is unready only Germany and her marionette Austria
the strings of which she pulls is ready

Go on prophesying said Michael

I wish I could Ever since that Sarajevo murder I have thought of
nothing else day and night But how events will develop then I cant
imagine What will England do Who knows I only know what Germany
thinks she will do and that is stand aside because she cant stir
with this Irish millstone round her neck If Germany thought otherwise
she is perfectly capable of sending a dozen submarines over to our naval
manoeuvres and torpedoing our battleships right and left

Michael laughed outright at this

While a fleet of Zeppelins hovers over London and drops bombs on the
War Office and the Admiralty he suggested

But Aunt Barbara was not in the least diverted by this

And if England stands aside she said Der Tag will only dawn a
little later when Germany has settled with France and Russia We shall
live to see Der Tag Michael unless we are run over by motorbuses and
pray God we shall see it soon for the sooner the better Your adorable
Falbes now Sylvia and Hermann What do they think of it

Hermann was certainly ratherrather upset when he read of the Sarajevo
murders he said But he pins his faith on the German Emperor whom he
alluded to as a fireengine which would put out any conflagration

Aunt Barbara rose in violent incredulity

Pish and bosh she remarked If he had alluded to him as an
incendiary bomb there would have been more sense in his simile

Anyhow he and Sylvia are planning a musical tour in Germany in the
autumn said Michael

Its a long long way to Tipperary remarked Aunt Barbara
enigmatically

Why Tipperary asked Michael

Oh its just a song I heard at a musichall the other night Theres
a jolly catchy tune to it which has rung in my head ever since Thats
the sort of music I like something you can carry away with you And
your music Michael

Rather in abeyance There areother things to think about

Aunt Barbara got up

Ah tell me more about them she said I want to get this nightmare
out of my head Sylvia now Sylvia is a good cure for the nightmare Is
she kind as she is fair Michael

Michael was silent for a moment Then he turned a quiet radiant face to
her

I cant talk about it he said I cant get accustomed to the wonder
of it

That will do Thats a completely satisfactory account But go on

Michael laughed

How can I he asked Theres no end and no beginning I cant go on
as you order me about a thing like that There is Sylvia there is me

I must be content with that then she said smiling

We are said Michael

Lady Barbara waited a moment without speaking

And your mother she asked

He shook his head

She still refuses to see me he said She still thinks it was I who
made the plot to take her away and shut her up She is often angry with
me poor darling butbut you see it isnt she who is angry its just
her malady

Yes my dear said Lady Barbara I am so glad you see it like that

How else could I see it It was my real mother whom I began to know
last Christmas and whom I was with in town for the three months that
followed Thats how I think of her I cant think of her as anything
else

And how is she otherwise

Again he shook his head

She is wretched though they say that all she feels is dim and veiled
that we mustnt think of her as actually unhappy Sometimes there are
good days when she takes a certain pleasure in her walks and in looking
after a little plot of ground where she gardens And thank God that
sudden outburst when she tried to kill me seems to have entirely passed
from her mind They dont think she remembers it at all But then the
good days are rare and are growing rarer and often now she sits doing
nothing at all but crying

Aunt Barbara laid her hand on him

Oh my dear she said

Michael paused for a moment his brown eyes shining

If only she could come back just for a little to what she was in
January he said She was happier then I think than she ever was
before I cant help wondering if anyhow I could have prolonged those
days by giving myself up to her more completely

My dear you neednt wonder about that said Aunt Barbara Sir James
told me that it was your love and nothing else at all that gave her
those days

Michaels lips quivered

I cant tell you what they were to me he said for she and I found
each other then and we both felt we had missed each other so much and
so long She was happy then and I too And now everything has
been taken from her and still in spite of that my cup is full to
overflowing

Thats how she would have it Michael said Barbara

Yes I know that I remind myself of that

Again he paused

They dont think she will live very long he said She is getting
physically much weaker But during this last week or two she has been
less unhappy they think They say some new change may come any time
it may be only the great changeI mean her death but it is possible
before that that her mind will clear again Sir James told me that
occasionally happened likelike a ray of sunlight after a stormy day
It would be good if that happened I would give almost anything to feel
that she and I were together again as we were

Barbara childless felt something of motherhood Michaels simplicity
and his sincerity were already known to her but she had never yet
known the strength of him You could lean on Michael In his quiet
undemonstrative way he supported you completely as a son should there
was no possibility of insecurity   

God bless you my dear she said


CHAPTER XIII


One close thundery morning about a week later Michael was sitting at
his piano in his shirtsleeves busy practising He was aware that at the
other end of the room the telephone was calling for him but it seemed
to be of far greater importance at the minute to finish the last page of
one of the Bach fugues than to attend to what anybody else might have
to say to him Then it suddenly flashed across him that it might be
Sylvia who wanted to speak to him or that there might be news about his
mother and his fingers leaped from the piano in the middle of a bar
and he ran and slid across the parquet floor

But it was neither of these and compared to them it was a case of
only Hermann who wanted to see him But Hermann it appeared wanted
to see him urgently and if he was in which he was would be with him
in ten minutes

But the Bach thread was broken and Michael since it was not worth
while trying to mend it for the sake of these few minutes sat down by
the open window and idly took up the morning paper which as yet he had
not opened since he had hurried over breakfast in order to get to his
piano The music announcements on the outside page first detained him
and seeing that the concert by the Falbes which was to take place in
five or six days was advertised he wondered vaguely whether it was
about that that Hermann wanted to see him and if so why he could not
have said whatever he had to say on the telephone instead of cutting
things short with the curt statement that he wished to see him urgently
and would come round at once Then remembering that Francis had been
playing cricket for the Guards yesterday he turned briskly over to the
last page of sporting news and found that his cousin had distinguished
himself by making no runs at all but by missing two expensive catches
in the deep field From there after a slight inspection of a couple
of advertisement columns he worked back to the middle leaf where were
leaders and the news of nations and the movements of kings All this
last week he had scanned such items with a growing sense of amusement
in the recollection of Hermanns disquiet over the Sarajevo murders
and Aunt Barbaras more detailed and vivid prognostications of coming
danger for nothing more had happened and he supposedvaguely only
since the affair had begun to fade from his mindthat Austria had
made inquiries and that since she was satisfied there was no public
pronouncement to be made

The hot breeze from the window made the paper a little unmanageable for
a moment but presently he got it satisfactorily folded and a big black
headline met his eye A halfcolumn below it contained the demands which
Austria had made in the Note addressed to the Servian Government
A glance was sufficient to show that they were framed in the most
truculent and threatening manner possible to imagine They were not
the reasonable proposals that one State had a perfect right to make
of another on whose soil and with the connivance of whose subjects the
murders had been committed they were a piece of arbitrary dictation a
threat levelled against a dependent and an inferior

Michael had read them through twice with a growing sense of uneasiness
at the thought of how Lady Barbaras first anticipations had been
fulfilled when Hermann came in He pointed to the paper Michael held

Ah you have seen it he said Perhaps you can guess what I wanted to
see you about

Connected with the Austrian Note asked Michael

Yes

I have not the vaguest idea

Hermann sat down on the arm of his chair

Mike Im going back to Germany today he said Now do you
understand Im German

You mean that Germany is at the back of this

It is obvious isnt it Those demands couldnt have been made without
the consent of Austrias ally And they wont be granted Servia will
appeal to Russia And    and then God knows what may happen In the
event of that happening I must be in my Fatherland ready to serve if
necessary

You mean you think it possible you will go to war with Russia asked
Michael

Yes I think it possible and if I am right if there is that
possibility I cant be away from my country

But the Emperor the fireengine whom you said would quench any
conflagration

He is away yachting He went off after the visit of the British fleet
to Kiel Who knows whether before he gets back things may have gone
too far Cant you see that I must go Wouldnt you go if you were me
Suppose you were in Germany now wouldnt you hurry home

Michael was silent and Hermann spoke again

And if there is trouble with Russia France I take it is bound to
join her And if France joins her what will England do

The great shadow of the approaching storm fell over Michael even as
outside the sultry stillness of the morning grew darker

Ah you think that asked Michael

Hermann put his hand on Michaels shoulder

Mike youre the best friend I have he said and soon please God
you are going to marry the girl who is everything else in the world to
me You two make up my world reallyyou two and my mother anyhow
No other individual counts or is in the same class You know that
I expect But there is one other thing and thats my nationality It
counts first Nothing nobody not even Sylvia or my mother or you can
stand between me and that I expect you know that also for you saw
nearly a year ago what Germany is to me Perhaps I may be quite wrong
about it allabout the gravity I mean of the situation and perhaps
in a few days I may come racing home again Yes I said home didnt
I Well that shows you just how I am torn in two But I cant help
going

Hermanns hand remained on his shoulder gently patting it To Michael
the world life the whole spirit of things had suddenly grown sinister
of the quality of nightmare It was true that all the ground of this
ominous depression which had darkened round him was conjectural and
speculative that diplomacy backed by the horror of war which surely
all civilised nations and responsible govermnents must share had so
far from saying its last not yet said its first word that the wits of
all the Cabinets of Europe were at this moment only just beginning to
stir themselves so as to secure a peaceful solution but in spite
of this the darkness and the nightmare grew in intensity But as to
Hermanns determination to go to Germany which made this so terribly
real since it was beginning to enter into practical everyday life
he had neither means nor indeed desire to combat it He saw perfectly
clearly that Hermann must go

I dont want to dissuade you he said not only because it would be
useless but because I am with you You couldnt do otherwise Hermann

I dont see that I could Sylvia agrees too

A terrible conjecture flashed through Michaels mind

And she he asked

She cant leave my mother of course said Hermann and after all
I may be on a wild goose chase But I cant risk being unable to get to
Germany ifif the worst happens

The ghost of a smile played round his mouth for a moment

And Im not sure that she could leave you Mike he added

Somehow this though it gave Michael a moment of intensest relief to
know that Sylvia remained made the shadow grow deeper accentuated the
lines of the storm which had begun to spread over the sky He began
to see as nightmare no longer but as stern and possible realities
something of the unutterable woe the divisions the heartbreaks which
menaced

Hermann what do you think will happen he said It is incredible
unfaceable

The gentle patting on his shoulder that suddenly and poignantly
reminded him of when Sylvias hand was there ceased for a moment and
then was resumed

Mike old boy said Hermann weve got to face the unfaceable and
believe that the incredible is possible I may be all wrong about it
and as I say in a few days time I may come racing back But on
the other hand this may be our last talk together for I go off this
afternoon So lets face it

He paused a moment

It may be that before long I shall be fighting for my Fatherland
he said And if there is to be fighting it may be that Germany will
before long be fighting England There I shall be on one side and
since naturally you will go back into the Guards you will be fighting
on the other I shall be doing my best to kill Englishmen whom I love
and they will be doing their best to kill me and those of my blood
Theres the horror of it and its that we must face If we met in a
bayonet charge Mike I should have to do my best to run you through
and yet I shouldnt love you one bit the less and you must know that
Or if you ran me through I shall have to die loving you just the same
as before and hoping you would live happy for ever and ever as the
storybooks say with Sylvia

Hermann dont go said Michael suddenly

Mike you didnt mean that he said

Michael looked at him for a moment in silence

No it is unsaid he replied

Hermann looked round as the clock on the chimneypiece chimed

I must be going he said I neednt say anything to you about Sylvia
because all I could say is in your heart already Well weve met in
this jolly world Mike and weve been great friends Neither you nor I
could find a greater friend than weve been to each other I bless God
for this last year Its been the happiest in my life Now what else is
there Your music dont ever be lazy about your music Its worth while
taking all the pains you can about it Lord do you remember the evening
when I first tried your Variations    Let me play the last one now
I want something jubilant Lets see how does it go

He held his hands those long slimfingered hands poised for a moment
above the keys then plunged into the glorious riot of the full chords
and scales till the room rang with it The last chord he held for a
moment and then sprang up

Ah thats good he said And now Im going to say goodbye and go
without looking round

But might I see you off this afternoon asked Michael

No please dont Station partings are fussy and disagreeable I want
to say goodbye to you here in your quiet room just as I shall say
goodbye to Sylvia at home Ah Mike yes both hands and smiling May
God give us other meetings and talks and companionship and years of
love my best of friends Goodbye

Then as he had said he walked to the door without looking round and
next moment it had closed behind him


Throughout the next week the tension of the situation grew ever greater
strained towards the snappingpoint while the little cloud the mans
hand which had arisen above the eastern horizon grew and overspread the
heavens in a pall that became ever more black and threatening For a few
days yet it seemed that perhaps even now the cataclysm might be averted
but gradually in spite of all the efforts of diplomacy to loosen the
knot it became clear that the ends of the cord were held in hands that
did not mean to release their hold till it was pulled tight Servia
yielded to such demands as it was possible for her to grant as an
independent State but the inflexible fingers never abated one jot
of their strangling pressure She appealed to Russia and Russias
remonstrance fell on deaf ears or rather on ears that had determined
not to hear From London and Paris came proposals for conference for
arbitration with welcome for any suggestion from the other side which
might lead to a peaceful solution of the disputed demands already
recognised by Europe as a firebrand wantonly flung into the midst
of dangerous and inflammable material Over that burning firebrand
preventing and warding off all the eager hands that were stretched to
put it out stood the figure of the nation at whose bidding it had been
flung there

Gradually out of the thunderclouds and gathering darkness vaguely at
first and then in definite and menacing outline emerged the inexorable
flintlike face of Germany whose figure was clad in the shining armour
so well known in the flamboyant utterances of her War Lord which had
been treated hitherto as mere irresponsible utterances to be greeted
with a laugh and a shrugged shoulder Deep and patient she had always
been and now she believed that the time had come for her patience to
do its perfect work She had bided long for the time when she could
best fling that lighted brand into the midst of civilisation and she
believed she had calculated well She cared nothing for Servia nor for
her ally On both her frontiers she was ready and now on the East
she heeded not the remonstrance of Russia nor her sincere and cordial
invitation to friendly discussion She but waited for the step that she
had made inevitable and on the first sign of Russian mobilisation she
with her mobilisation ready to be completed in a few days peremptorily
demanded that it should cease On the Western frontier behind the
Rhine she was ready also her armies were prepared cannon fodder in
uncountable store of shells and cartridges was prepared and in endless
battalions of men waiting to be discharged in one bulllike rush to
overrun France and holding the French armies shattered and dispersed
with a mere handful of her troops to hurl the rest at Russia

The whole campaign was mathematically thought out In a few months at
the outside France would be lying trampled down and bleeding Russia
would be overrun already she would be mistress of Europe and prepared
to attack the only country that stood between her and worldwide
dominion whose allies she would already have reduced to impotence
Here she staked on an uncertainty she could not absolutely tell what
Englands attitude would be but she had the strongest reason for hoping
that distracted by the imminence of civil strife she would be unable
to come to the help of her allies until the allies were past helping

For a moment only were seen those set stern features mad for war
then with a snap Germany shut down her visor and stood with sword
unsheathed waiting for the horror of the stupendous bloodshed which
she had made inevitable Her legions gathered on the Eastern front
threatening war on Russia and thus pulling France into the spreading
conflagration and into the midst of the flame she stood ready to cast
the tornup fragments of the treaty that bound her to respect the
neutrality of Belgium

All this week while the flames of the flung firebrand began to spread
the English public waited incredulous of the inevitable Michael among
them found himself unable to believe even then that the bugles were
already sounding and that the piles of shells in their wickerbaskets
were being loaded on to the military ammunition trains But all the
ordinary interests in life all the things that busily and contentedly
occupied his day one only excepted had become without savour A dozen
times in the morning he would sit down to his piano only to find
that he could not think it worth while to make his hands produce these
meaningless tinkling sounds and he would jump up to read the paper
over again or watch for fresh headlines to appear on the boards of
newsvendors in the street and send out for any fresh edition Or he
would walk round to his club and spend an hour reading the tape news and
waiting for fresh slips to be pinned up But through all the nightmare
of suspense and slowlydying hope Sylvia remained real and after he
had received his daily report from the establishment where his mother
was with the invariable message that there was no marked change of any
kind and that it was useless for him to think of coming to see her he
would go off to Maidstone Crescent and spend the greater part of the day
with the girl

Once during this week he had received a note from Hermann written at
Munich and on the same day she also had heard from him He had gone
back to his regiment which was mobilised as a private and was very
busy with drill and duties Feeling in Germany he said was elated and
triumphant it was considered certain that England would stand aside as
the quarrel was none of hers and the nation generally looked forward to
a short and brilliant campaign with the occupation of Paris to be made
in September at the latest But as a postscript in his note to Sylvia he
had added


You dont think there is the faintest chance of England coming in do
you Please write to me fully and get Mike to write I have heard from
neither of you and as I am sure you must have written I conclude
that letters are stopped I went to the theatre last night there was a
tremendous scene of patriotism The people are warmad


Since then nothing had been heard from him and today as Michael drove
down to see Sylvia he saw on the newsboards that Belgium had appealed
to England against the violation of her territory by the German armies
en route for France Overtures had been made asking for leave to pass
through the neutral territory these Belgium had rejected This was
given as official news There came also the report that the Belgian
remonstrances would be disregarded Should she refuse passage to the
German battalions that could make no difference since it was a matter
of life and death to invade France by that route

Sylvia was out in the garden where hardly a month ago they had spent
that evening of silent peace and she got up quickly as Michael came
out

Ah my dear she said I am glad you have come I have got the
horrors You saw the latest news Yes And have you heard again from
Hermann No I have not had a word

He kissed her and sat down

No I have not heard either he said I expect he is right Letters
have been stopped

And what do you think will be the result of Belgiums appeal she
asked

Who can tell The Prime Minister is going to make a statement on
Monday There have been Cabinet meetings going on all day

She looked at him in silence

And what do you think she asked

Quite suddenly at her question Michael found himself facing it even
as when the final catastrophe was more remote he had faced it with
Falbe All this week he knew he had been looking away from it telling
himself that it was incredible Now he discovered that the one thing
he dreaded more than that England should go to war was that she
should not The consciousness of national honour the thing which with
religion Englishmen are most shy of speaking about suddenly asserted
itself and he found on the moment that it was bigger than anything else
in the world

I think we shall go to war he said I dont see personally how we
can exist any more as a nation if we dont Wewe shall be damned if we
dont damned for ever and ever Its moral extinction not to

She kindled at that

Yes I know she said thats what I have been telling myself but
oh Mike theres some dreadful cowardly part of me that wont listen
when I think of Hermann and   

She broke off a moment

Michael she said what will you do if there is war

He took up her hand that lay on the arm of his chair

My darling how can you ask he said Of course I shall go back to
the army

For one moment she gave way

No no she said You mustnt do that

And then suddenly she stopped

My dear I ask your pardon she said Of course you will I know
that really Its only this stupid cowardly part of me thatthat
interrupted I am ashamed of it Im not as bad as that all through
I dont make excuses for myself but ah Mike when I think of what
Germany is to me and what Hermann is and when I think what England is
to me and what you are It shant appear again or if it does you
will make allowance wont you At least I can agree with you utterly
utterly Its the flesh thats weak or rather that is so strong But
Ive got it under

She sat there in silence a little mopping her eyes

How I hate girls who cry she said It is so dreadfully feeble Look
Mike there are some roses on that tree from which I plucked the one you
didnt think much of Do you remember You crushed it up in my hand and
made it bleed

He smiled

I have got some faint recollection of it he said

Sylvia had got hold of her courage again

Have you she asked What a wonderful memory And that quiet evening
out here next day Perhaps you remember that too That was real that
was a possession that we shant ever part with

She pointed with her finger

You and I sat there and Hermann there she said And mother
satwhy there she is Mother darling lets have tea out here shall
we I will go and tell them

Mrs Falbe had drifted out in her usual thistledown style and shook
hands with Michael

What an upset it all is she said with all these dreadful rumours
going about that we shall be at war I fell asleep I think a little
after lunch when I could not attend to my book for thinking about war

Isnt the book interesting asked Michael

No not very It is rather painful I do not know why people write
about painful things when there are so many pleasant and interesting
things to write about It seems to me very morbid

Michael heard something cried in the streets and at the same moment he
heard Sylvias step quickly crossing the studio to the side door that
opened on to it In a minute she returned with a fresh edition of an
evening paper

They are preparing to cross the Rhine she said

Mrs Falbe gave a little sigh

I dont know I am sure she said what you are in such a state
about Sylvia Of course the Germans want to get into France the easiest
and quickest way at least Im sure I should It is very foolish of
Belgium not to give them leave as they are so much the strongest

Mother darling you dont understand one syllable about it said
Sylvia

Very likely not dear but I am very glad we are an island and that
nobody can come marching here But it is all a dreadful upset LordI
mean Michael what with Hermann in Germany and the concert tour
abandoned Still if everything is quiet again by the middle of October
as I daresay it will be it might come off after all He will be on the
spot and you and Michael can join him though Im not quite sure if
that would be proper But we might arrange something he might meet you
at Ostend

Im afraid it doesnt look very likely remarked Michael mildly

Oh and are you pessimistic too like Sylvia Pray dont be
pessimistic There is a dreadful pessimist in my book who always thinks
the worst is going to happen

And does it asked Michael

As far as I have got it does which makes it all the worse Of course
I am very anxious about Hermann but I feel sure he will come back
safe to us I daresay France will give in when she sees Germany is in
earnest

Mrs Falbe pulled the shattered remnants of her mind together In her
heart of hearts she knew she did not care one atom what might happen to
armies and navies and nations provided only that she had a quantity
of novels to read and meals at regular hours The fact of being on an
island was an immense consolation to her since it was quite certain
that whatever happened German armies or French or Soudanese for that
matter could not march here and enter her sittingroom and take her
books away from her For years past she had asked nothing more of the
world than that she should be comfortable in it and it really seemed
not an unreasonable request considering at how small an outlay of money
all the comfort she wanted could be secured to her The thought of war
had upset her a good deal already she had been unable to attend to her
book when she awoke from her afterlunch nap and now when she hoped to
have her tea in peace and find her attention restored by it she found
the general atmosphere of her two companions vaguely disquieting She
became a little more loquacious than usual with the idea of talking
herself back into a tranquil frame of mind and reassuring to herself
the promise of a peaceful future

Such a blessing we have a good fleet she said That will make us
safe wont it I declare I almost hate the Germans though my dear
husband was one himself for making such a disturbance The papers all
say it is Germanys fault so I suppose it must be The papers
know better than anybody dont they because they have foreign
correspondents That must be a great expense

Sylvia felt she could not endure this any longer It was like having a
raw wound stroked   

Mother you dont understand she said You dont appreciate what is
happening In a day or two England will be at war with Germany

Mrs Falbes book had slipped from her knee She picked it up and
flapped the cover once or twice to get rid of dust that might have
settled there

But what then she said It is very dreadful no doubt to think
of dear Hermann being with the German army but we are getting used to
that are we not Besides he told me it was his duty to go I do not
think for a moment that France will be able to stand against Germany
Germany will be in Paris in no time and I daresay Hermanns next letter
will be to say that he has been walking down the boulevards Of course
war is very dreadful I know that And then Germany will be at war with
Russia too but she will have Austria to help her And as for Germany
being at war with England that does not make me nervous Think of our
fleet and how safe we feel with that I see that we have twice as many
boats as the Germans With two to one we must win and they wont be
able to send any of their armies here I feel quite comfortable again
now that I have talked it over

Sylvia caught Michaels eye for a moment over the teaurn She felt he
acquiesced in what she was intending to say

That is good then she said I am glad you feel comfortable about
it mother dear Now will you read your book out here Why not if I
fetch you a shawl in case you feel cold

Mrs Falbe turned a questioning eye to the motionless trees and the
unclouded sky

I dont think I shall even want a shawl dear she said Listen how
the newsboys are calling is it something fresh do you think

A moments listening attention was sufficient to make it known that
the news shouted outside was concerned only with the result of a county
cricket match and Michael as well as Sylvia was conscious of a
certain relief to know that at the immediate present there was no fresh
clang of the bell that was beating out the seconds of peace that still
remained Just for now for this hour on Saturday afternoon there was
a respite no new link was forged in the intolerable sequence of
events But even as he drew breath in that knowledge there came
the counterstroke in the sense that those whose business it was to
disseminate the news that would cause their papers to sell had just a
cricket match to advertise their wares Now when the country and
when Europe were on the brink of a bloodier war than all the annals of
history contained they who presumably knew what the public desired
to be informed on thought that the news which would sell best was that
concerned with wooden bats and leather balls and strong young men
in flannels Michael had heard with a sort of tender incredulity Mrs
Falbes optimistic reflections and had been more than content to let
her rest secure in them but was the country the heart of England like
her Did it care more for cricket matches as she for her book than for
the maintenance of the nations honour whatever that championship might
cost    And the cry went on past the gardenwalk Fine innings by
Horsfield Result of the Oval match

And yet he had just had his tea as usual and eaten a slice of cake and
was now smoking a cigarette It was natural to do that not to make a
fuss and refuse food and drink and it was natural that people should
still be interested in cricket And at the moment his attitude towards
Mrs Falbe changed Instead of pity and irritation at her normality he
was suddenly taken with a sense of gratitude to her It was restful to
suspense and jangled nerves to see someone who went on as usual The sun
shone the leaves of the planetrees did not wither Mrs Falbe read
her book the evening paper was full of cricket news    And then the
reaction from that seized him again Supposing all the nation was like
that Supposing nobody cared    And the tension of suspense strained
more tightly than ever

For the next fortyeight hours while day and night the telegraph wires
of Europe tingled with momentous questions and grave replies while
Ministers and Ambassadors met and parted and met again rumours
flew this way and that like flocks of wildfowl driven backwards and
forwards settling for a moment with a stir and splash and then with
rush of wings speeding back and on again A huge coal strike in the
northern counties fostered and financed by German gold was supposed to
be imminent and this would put out of the countrys power the ability
to interfere The Irish Home Rule party under the same suasion was
said to have refused to call a truce A letter had been received in
high quarters from the German Emperor avowing his fixed determination to
preserve peace and this was honey to Lord Ashbridge Then in turn each
of these was contradicted All thought of the coal strike in this crisis
of national affairs was abandoned the Irish party as well as the
Conservatives were of one mind in backing up the Government no matter
what postponement of questions that were vital a month ago their
cohesion entailed the Emperor had written no letter at all But through
the nebulous mists of hearsay there fell solid the first drops of the
imminent storm Even before Michael had left Sylvia that afternoon
Germany had declared war on Russia on Sunday Belgium received a Note
from Berlin definitely stating that should their Government not grant
the passage to the German battalions a way should be forced for them
On Monday finally Germany declared war on France also

The country held its breath in suspense at what the decision of the
Government which should be announced that afternoon should be One
fact only was publicly known and that was that the English fleet only
lately dismissed from its manoeuvres and naval review had vanished
There were guard ships old cruisers and what not at certain ports
torpedoboats roamed the horizons of Deal and Portsmouth but the great
fleet the swift forts of seapower had gone disappearing no one knew
where into the fine weather haze that brooded over the midsummer sea
There perhaps was an indication of what the decision would be yet there
was no certainty At home there was official silence and from abroad
apart from the three vital facts came but the quacking of rumour
report after report each contradicting the other

Then suddenly came certainty a rainbow set in the intolerable cloud On
Monday afternoon when the House of Commons met all parties were known
to have sunk their private differences and to be agreed on one point
that should take precedence of all other questions Germany should not
with Englands consent violate the neutrality of Belgium As far as
England was concerned all negotiations were at an end diplomacy had
said its last word and Germany was given twentyfour hours in which to
reply Should a satisfactory answer not be forthcoming England would
uphold the neutrality she with others had sworn to respect by force
of arms And at that one immense sigh of relief went up from the whole
country Whatever now might happen in whatever horrors of longdrawn
and bloody war the nation might be involved the nightmare of possible
neutrality of Englands repudiating the debt of honour was removed
The one thing worse than war need no longer be dreaded and for the
moment the future hideous and heartrending though it would surely be
smiled like a land of promise


Michael woke on the morning of Tuesday the fourth of August with the
feeling of something having suddenly roused him and in a few seconds he
knew that this was so for the telephone bell in the room next door sent
out another summons He got straight out of bed and went to it with a
hundred vague shadows of expectation crossing his mind Then he learned
that his mother was gravely ill and that he was wanted at once And in
less than half an hour he was on his way driving swiftly through the
serene warmth of the early morning to the private asylum where she had
been removed after her sudden homicidal outburst in March


CHAPTER XIV


Michael was sitting that same afternoon by his mothers bedside He
had learned the little there was to be told him on his arrival in the
morning how that half an hour before he had been summoned she had had
an attack of heart failure and since then after recovering from the
acute and immediate danger she had lain there all day with closed eyes
in a state of but semiconscious exhaustion Once or twice only and
that but for a moment she had shown signs of increasing vitality and
then sank back into this stupor again But in those rare short intervals
she had opened her eyes and had seemed to see and recognise him and
Michael thought that once she had smiled at him But at present she had
spoken no word All the morning Lord Ashbridge had waited there too but
since there was no change he had gone away saying that he would return
again later and asking to be telephoned for if his wife regained
consciousness So but for the nurse and the occasional visits of the
doctor Michael was alone with his mother

In this long period of inactive waiting when there was nothing to be
done Michael did not seem to himself to be feeling very vividly and
but for one desire namely that before the end his mother would come
back to him even if only for a moment his mind felt drugged and
stupefied Sometimes for a little it would sluggishly turn over thoughts
about his father wondering with a sort of blunt remote contempt how it
was possible for him not to be here too but except for the one great
longing that his mother should cleave to him once more in conscious
mind he observed rather than felt The thought of Sylvia even was dim
He knew that she was somewhere in the world but she had become for the
present like some picture painted in his mind without reality Dim
too was the tension of those last days Somewhere in Europe was a
country called Germany where was his best friend drilling in the ranks
to which he had returned or perhaps already on his way to bloodier
battlefields than the world had ever dreamed of and somewhere set in
the seas was Germanys archfoe who already stood in her path with open
cannon mouths pointing But all this had no real connection with him
From the moment when he had come into this quiet orderly room and saw
his mother lying on the bed nothing beyond those four walls really
concerned him

But though the emotional side of his mind lay drugged and insensitive
to anything outside he found himself observing the details of the room
where he waited with a curious vividness There was a big window opening
down to the ground in the manner of a door on to the garden outside
where a smooth lawn set with croquet hoops and edged with bright
flowerbeds dozed in the haze of the August heat Beyond was a row
of tall elms against which a copper beech glowed metallically and
somewhere out of sight a mowingmachine was being used for Michael
heard the click of its cropping journey growing fainter as it receded
followed by the pause as it turned and its gradual crescendo as it
approached again Otherwise everything outside was strangely silent as
the hot hours of midday and early afternoon went by there was no note of
birdmusic nor any sound of wind in the elmtops Just a little breeze
stirred from time to time enough to make the slats of the halfdrawn
Venetian blind rattle faintly Earlier in the day there had come in from
the window the smell of dewdamp earth but now that had been sucked up
by the sun

Close beside the window with her back to the light and facing the bed
which projected from one of the side walls out into the room sat Lady
Ashbridges nurse She was reading and the rustle of the turned page
was regular but regular and constant also were her glances towards the
bed where her patient lay At intervals she put down her book marking
the place with a slip of paper and came to watch by the bed for a
moment looking at Lady Ashbridges face and listening to her breathing
Her eye met Michaels always as she did this and in answer to his
mute question each time she gave him a little headshake or perhaps a
whispered word or two that told him there was no change Opposite the
bed was the empty fireplace and at the foot of it a table on which
stood a vase of roses Michael was conscious of the scent of these every
now and then and at intervals of the faint rather sickly smell of
ether A Japan screen ornamented with storks in gold thread stood
near the door and halfconcealed the washingstand There was a chest
of drawers on one side of the fireplace a wardrobe with a lookingglass
door on the other a dressingtable to one side of the window a few
prints on the plain blue walls and a dark blue drugget carpet on
the floor and all these ordinary appurtenances of a bedroom etched
themselves into Michaels mind biting their way into it by the acid of
his own suspense

Finally there was the bed where his mother lay The coverlet of blue
silk upon it he knew was somehow familiar to him and after fitful
gropings in his mind to establish the association he remembered that it
had been on the bed in her room in Curzon Street and supposed that it
had been brought here with others of her personal belongings A little
core of light focused on one of the brass balls at the head of the bed
caught his eye and he saw that the sun beginning to decline came in
under the Venetian blind The nurse sitting in the window noticed
this also and lowered it The thought of Sylvia crossed his brain for
a moment then he thought of his father but every train of reflection
dissolved almost as soon as it was formed and he came back again and
again to his mothers face

It was perfectly peaceful and strangely younglooking as if the cool
soothing hand of death which presently would quiet all trouble for
her had been already at work there erasing the marks that the years had
graven upon it And yet it was not so much young as ageless it seemed
to have passed beyond the register and limitations of time Sometimes
for a moment it was like the face of a stranger and then suddenly it
would become beloved and familiar again It was just so she had looked
when she came so timidly into his room one night at Ashbridge asking
him if it would be troublesome to him if she sat and talked with him for
a little The mouth was a little parted for her slow even breathing
the corners of it smiled and yet he was not sure if they smiled It
was hard to tell for she lay there quite flat without pillows and he
looked at her from an unusual angle Sometimes he felt as if he had been
sitting there watching for uncounted years and then again the hours
that he had been here appeared to have lasted but for a moment as if he
had but looked once at her

As the day declined the breeze of evening awoke rattling the blind By
now the sun had swung farther west and the nurse pulled the blind up
Outside in the bushes in the garden the call of birds to each other had
begun and a thrush came close to the window and sang a liquid
phrase and then repeated it Michael glanced there and saw the bird
specklebreasted with throat that throbbed with the notes and then
looking back to the bed he saw that his mothers eyes were open

She looked vaguely about the room for a moment as if she had awoke from
some deep sleep and found herself in an unfamiliar place Then turning
her head slightly she saw him and there was no longer any question
as to whether her mouth smiled for all her face was flooded with deep
serene joy

He bent towards her and her lips parted

Michael my dear she said gently

Michael heard the rustle of the nurses dress as she got up and came to
the bedside He slipped from his chair on to his knees so that his face
was near his mothers He felt in his heart that the moment he had so
longed for was to be granted him that she had come back to him not
only as he had known her during the weeks that they had lived alone
together when his presence made her so content but in a manner
infinitely more real and more embracing

Have you been sitting here all the time while I slept dear she
asked Have you been waiting for me to come back to you

Yes and you have come he said

She looked at him and the motherlove which before had been veiled and
clouded came out with all the tender radiance of evening sun with the
clear shining after rain

I knew you wouldnt fail me my darling she said You were so
patient with me in the trouble I have been through It was a nightmare
but it has gone

Michael bent forward and kissed her

Yes mother he said it has all gone

She was silent a moment

Is your father here she said

No but he will come at once if you would like to see him

Yes send for him dear if it would not vex him to come she said
or get somebody else to send I dont want you to leave me

Im not going to said he

The nurse went to the door gave some message and presently returned to
the other side of the bed Then Lady Ashbridge spoke again

Is this death she asked

Michael raised his eyes to the figure standing by the bed She nodded to
him

He bent forward again

Yes dear mother he said

For a moment her eyes dilated then grew quiet again and the smile
returned to her mouth

Im not frightened Michael she said with you there It isnt
lonely or terrible

She raised her head

My son she said in a voice loud and triumphant Then her head fell
back again and she lay with face close to his and her eyelids quivered
and shut Her breath came slow and regular as if she slept Then he
heard that she missed a breath and soon after another Then without
struggle at all her breathing ceased    And outside on the lawn
close by the open window the thrush still sang


It was an hour later when Michael left having waited for his fathers
arrival and drove to town through the clear falling dusk He was
conscious of no feeling of grief at all only of a complete pervading
happiness He could not have imagined so perfect a close nor could he
have desired anything different from that imperishable moment when his
mother all trouble past had come back to him in the serene calm of
love   

As he entered London he saw the newsboards all placarded with one fact
England had declared war on Germany


He went not to his own flat but straight to Maidstone Crescent With
those few minutes in which his mother had known him the stupor that had
beset his emotions all day passed off and he felt himself longing as
he had never longed before for Sylvias presence Long ago he had given
her all that he knew of as himself now there was a fresh gift He had
to give her all that those moments had taught him Even as already they
were knitted into him made part of him so must they be to her   
And when they had shared that when like water gushing from a spring
she flooded him there was that other news which he had seen on the
newsboards that they had to share together

Sylvia had been alone all day with her mother but before Michael
arrived Mrs Falbe after a few more encouraging remarks about war in
general to the effect that Germany would soon beat France and what a
blessing it was that England was an island had taken her book up to her
room and Sylvia was sitting alone in the deep dusk of the evening She
did not even trouble to turn on the light for she felt unable to apply
herself to any practical task and she could think and take hold of
herself better in the dark All day she had longed for Michael to come
to her though she had not cared to see anybody else and several times
she had rung him up only to find that he was still out supposedly
with his mother for he had been summoned to her early that morning and
since then no news had come of him Just before dinner had arrived the
announcement of the declaration of war and Sylvia sat now trying to
find some escape from the encompassing nightmare She felt confused
and distracted with it she could not think consecutively but
only contemplate shudderingly the series of pictures that presented
themselves to her mind Somewhere now in the hosts of the Fatherland
which was hers also was Hermann the brother who was part of herself
When she thought of him she seemed to be with him to see the glint
of his rifle to feel her heart on his heart big with passionate
patriotism She had no doubt that patriotism formed the essence of his
consciousness and yet by now probably he knew that the land beloved by
him where he had made his home was at war with his own She could not
but know how often his thoughts dwelled here in the dark quiet studio
where she sat and where so many days of happiness had been passed She
knew what she was to him she and her mother and Michael and the hosts
of friends in this land which had become his foe Would he have gone
she asked herself if he had guessed that there would be war between the
two She thought he would though she knew that for herself she would
have made it as hard as possible for him to do so She would have used
every argument she could think of to dissuade him and yet she felt that
her entreaties would have beaten in vain against the granite of his and
her nationality Dimly she had foreseen this contingency when a few
days ago she had asked Michael what he would do if England went to war
and now that contingency was realised and Hermann was even now perhaps
on his way to violate the neutrality of the country for the sake of
which England had gone to war On the other side was Michael into whose
keeping she had given herself and her love and on which side was she
It was then that the nightmare came close to her she could not tell
she was utterly unable to decide Her heart was Michaels her heart
was her brothers also The one personified Germany for her the other
England It was as if she saw Hermann and Michael with bayonet and rifle
stalking each other across some land of sanddunes and hollows creeping
closer to each other always closer She felt as if she would have
gladly given herself over to an eternity of torment if only they could
have had one hour more all three of them together here as on that
night of stars and peace when first there came the news which for the
moment had disquieted Hermann

She longed as with thirst for Michael to come and as her solitude
became more and more intolerable a hundred hideous fancies obsessed
her What if some accident had happened to Michael or what if in this
tremendous breaking of ties that the war entailed he felt that he could
not see her She knew that was an impossibility but the whole world had
become impossible And there was no escape Somehow she had to adjust
herself to the unthinkable somehow her relations both with Hermann and
Michael had to remain absolutely unshaken Even that was not enough
they had to be strengthened made impregnable

Then came a knock on the side door of the studio that led into the
street Michael often came that way without passing through the house
and with a sense of relief she ran to it and unlocked it And even as
he stepped in before any word of greeting had been exchanged she flung
herself on him with fingers eager for the touch of his solidity   

Oh my dear she said I have longed for you just longed for you
I never wanted you so much I have been sitting in the dark
desolatedesolate And oh my darling what a beast I am to think of
nothing but myself I am ashamed What of your mother Michael

She turned on the light as they walked back across the studio and
Michael saw that her eyes which were a little dazzled by the change
from the dark into the light were dim with unshed tears and her hands
clung to him as never before had they clung She needed him now with
that imperative need which in trouble can only turn to love for comfort
She wanted that only the fact of him with her in this land in which
she had suddenly become an alien an enemy though all her friends
except Hermann were here And instantaneously as a baby at the breast
she found that all his strength and serenity were hers

They sat down on the sofa by the piano side by side with hands
intertwined before Michael answered He looked up at her as he spoke
and in his eyes was the quiet of love and death

My mother died an hour ago he said I was with her and as I had
longed might happen she came back to me before she died For two or
three minutes she was herself And then she said to me My son and
soon she ceased breathing

Oh Michael she said and for a little while there was silence and
in turn it was her presence that he clung to Presently he spoke again

Sylvia Im so frightfully hungry he said I dont think Ive eaten
anything since breakfast May we go and forage

Oh you poor thing she cried Yes lets go and see what there is

Instantly she busied herself

Hermann left the cellar key on the chimneypiece Michael she said
Get some wine out dear Mother and I dont drink any And theres some
ham I know While you are getting wine Ill broil some And there
were some strawberries I shall have some supper with you What a good
thought And you must be famished

As they ate they talked perfectly simply and naturally of the hundred
associations which this studio meal at the end of the evening called
up concerning the Sunday night parties There was an occasion on which
Hermann tried to recollect how to mull beer with results that smelled
like a brickfield there was another when a poached egg had fallen
exploding softly as it fell into the piano There was the occasion
the first on which Michael had been present when two eminent actors
imitated each other another when Francis came and made himself so
immensely agreeable It was after that one that Sylvia and Hermann had
sat and talked in front of the stove discussing as Sylvia laughed to
remember what she would say when Michael proposed to her Then had come
the break in Michaels attendances and as Sylvia allowed a certain
fallingoff in gaiety

But it was really Hermann and I who made you gay originally she said
We take a wonderful deal of credit for that

All this was as completely natural for them as was the impromptu meal
and soon without effort Michael spoke of his mother again and presently
afterwards of the news of war But with him by her side Sylvia found
her courage come back to her the news itself all that it certainly
implied and all the horror that it held no longer filled her with
the sense that it was impossibly terrible Michael did not diminish the
awfulness of it but he gave her the power of looking out bravely at it
Nor did he shrink from speaking of all that had been to her so grim a
nightmare

You havent heard from Hermann he asked

No And I suppose we cant hear now He is with his regiment thats
all nor shall we hear of him till there is peace again

She came a little closer to him

Michael I have to face it that I may never see Hermann again she
said Mother doesnt fear it you know Shethe darlingshe lives
in a sort of dream I dont want her to wake from it But how can I get
accustomed to the thought that perhaps I shant see Hermann again I
must get accustomed to it Ive got to live with it and not quarrel
with it

He took up her hand enclosing it in his

But one doesnt quarrel with the big things of life he said Isnt
it so We havent any quarrel with things like death and duty Dear me
Im afraid Im preaching

Preach then she said

Well its just that We dont quarrel with them they manage
themselves Hermanns going managed itself It had to be

Her voice quivered as she spoke now

Are you going she asked Will that have to be

Michael looked at her a moment with infinite tenderness

Oh my dear of course it will he said Of course one doesnt know
yet what the War Office will do about the Army I suppose its possible
that they will send troops to France All that concerns me is that I
shall rejoin again if they call up the Reserves

And they will

Yes I should think that is inevitable And you know theres something
big about it Im not warlike you know but I could not fail to be a
soldier under these new conditions any more than I could continue being
a soldier when all it meant was to be ornamental Hermann in bursts of
pride and patriotism used to call us toysoldiers But hes wrong now
were not going to be toysoldiers any more

She did not answer him but he felt her hand press close in the palm of
his

I cant tell you how I dreaded we shouldnt go to war he said That
has been a nightmare if you like It would have been the end of us if
we had stood aside and seen Germany violate a solemn treaty

Even with Michael close to her the call of her blood made itself
audible to Sylvia Instinctively she withdrew her hand from his

Ah you dont understand Germany at all she said Hermann always
felt that too He told me he felt he was talking gibberish to you when
he spoke of it It is clearly life and death to Germany to move against
France as quickly as possible

But theres a direct frontier between the two said he

No doubt but an impossible one

Michael frowned drawing his big eyebrows together

But nothing can justify the violation of a national oath he said
Thats the basis of civilisation a thing like that

But if its a necessity If a nations existence depends on it she
asked Oh Michael I dont know I dont know For a little I am
entirely English and then something calls to me from beyond the Rhine
Theres the hopelessness of it for me and such as me You are English
theres no question about it for you But for us I love England I
neednt tell you that But can one ever forget the land of ones birth
Can I help feeling the necessity Germany is under I cant believe that
she has wantonly provoked war with you

But consider said he

She got up suddenly

I cant argue about it she said I am English and I am German You
must make the best of me as I am But do be sorry for me and never
never forget that I love you entirely Thats the root fact between us
I cant go deeper than that because that reaches to the very bottom of
my soul Shall we leave it so Michael and not ever talk of it again
Wouldnt that be best

There was no question of choice for Michael in accepting that appeal
He knew with the inmost fibre of his being that Sylvia being Sylvia
nothing that she could say or do or feel could possibly part him from
her When he looked at it directly and simply like that there was
nothing that could blur the verity of it But the truth of what she
said the reality of that call of the blood seemed to cast a shadow
over it He knew beyond all other knowledge that it was there only it
looked out at him with a shadow faint but unmistakable fallen
across it But the sense of that made him the more eagerly accept her
suggestion

Yes darling well never speak of it again he said That would be
much wisest


Lady Ashbridges funeral took place three days afterwards down in
Suffolk and those hours detached themselves in Michaels mind from all
that had gone before and all that might follow like a little piece
of blue sky in the midst of storm clouds The limitations of mans
consciousness which forbid him to think poignantly about two things at
once hedged that day in with an impenetrable barrier so that while it
lasted and afterwards for ever in memory it was unflecked by trouble
or anxiety and hung between heaven and earth in a serenity of its own

The coffin lay that night in his mothers bedroom which was next to
Michaels and when he went up to bed he found himself listening for
any sound that came from there It seemed but yesterday when he had gone
rather early upstairs and after sitting a minute or two in front of
his fire had heard that timid knock on the door which had meant the
opening of a mothers heart to him He felt it would scarcely be strange
if that knock came again and if she entered once more to be with him
From the moment he came upstairs the rest of the world was shut down
to him he entered his bedroom as if he entered a sanctuary that was
scented with the incense of her love He knew exactly how her knock had
sounded when she came in here that night when first it burned for him
his ears were alert for it to come again Once his blind tapped against
the frame of his open window and though knowing it was that he heard
himself whisperfor she could hear his whisperCome in mother and
sat up in his deep chair looking towards the door But only the blind
tapped again and outside in the moonlit dusk an owl hooted

He remembered she liked owls Once when they lived alone in Curzon
Street some noise outside reminded her of the owls that hooted at
Ashbridgeshe had imitated their note saying it sounded like sleep
   She had sat in a chintzcovered chair close to him when at
Christmas she paid him that visit and now he again drew it close to his
own and laid his hand on its arm Petsy II had come in with her and
she had hoped that he would not annoy Michael

There were steps in the passage outside his room and he heard a little
shrill bark He opened his door and found his mothers maid there
trying to entice Petsy away from the room next to his The little dog
was curled up against it and now and then he turned round scratching at
it asking to enter He wont come away my lord said the maid hes
gone back a dozen times to the door

Michael bent down

Come Petsy he said come to bed in my room

The dog looked at him for a moment as if weighing his trustworthiness
Then he got up and with grotesque Chinese highstepping walk came to
him

Hell be all right with me he said to the maid

He took Petsy into his room next door and laid him on the chair in
which his mother had sat The dog moved round in a circle once or twice
and then settled himself down to sleep Michael went to bed also and
lay awake about a couple of minutes not thinking but only being while
the owls hooted outside

He awoke into complete consciousness knowing that something had aroused
him even as three days ago when the telephone rang to summon him to his
mothers deathbed Then he did not know what had awakened him but now
he was sure that there had been a tapping on his door And after he had
sat up in bed completely awake he heard Petsy give a little welcoming
bark Then came the noise of his small soft tail beating against the
cushion in the chair

Michael had no feeling of fright at all only of longing for something
that physically could not be And longing only longing once more he
said

Come in mother

He believed he heard the door whisper on the carpet but he saw nothing
Only the room was full of his mothers presence It seemed to him that
in obedience to her he lay down completely satisfied    He felt no
curiosity to see or hear more She was there and that was enough

He woke again a little after dawn Petsy between the window and the door
had jumped on to his bed to get out of the draught of the morning wind
For the door was opened


That morning the coffin was carried down the long winding path above the
deepwater reach where Michael and Francis at Christmas had heard the
sound of stealthy rowing and on to the boat that awaited it to ferry it
across to the church There was high tide and as they passed over the
estuary the stillness of supreme noon bore to them the tolling of the
bell The mourners from the house followed just three of them Lord
Ashbridge Michael and Aunt Barbara for the rest were to assemble at
the church But of all that one moment stood out for Michael above all
others when as they entered the graveyard someone whom he could not
see said I am the Resurrection and the Life and he heard that his
father by whom he walked suddenly caught his breath in a sob

All that day there persisted that sense of complete detachment from all
but her whose body they had laid to rest on the windy hill overlooking
the broad water His father Aunt Barbara the cousins and relations who
thronged the church were no more than inanimate shadows compared with
her whose presence had come last night into his room and had not left
him since The affairs of the world drums and the torch of war had
passed for those hours from his knowledge as at the centre of a cyclone
there was a windless calm Tomorrow he knew he would pass out into
the tumult again and the minutes slipped like pearls from a string
dropping into the dim gulf where the tempest raged   

He went back to town next morning after a short interview with his
father who was coming up later in the day when he told him that he
intended to go back to his regiment as soon as possible But knowing
that he meant to go by the slow midday train his father proposed to
stop the express for him that went through a few minutes before Michael
could hardly believe his ears   


CHAPTER XV


It was but a day or two after the outbreak of the war that it was
believed that an expeditionary force was to be sent to France to help
in arresting the Teutonic tide that was now breaking over Belgium but
no public and authoritative news came till after the first draft of the
force had actually set foot on French soil From the regiment of the
Guards which Michael had rejoined Francis was among the first batch of
officers to go and that evening Michael took down the news to Sylvia
Already stories of German barbarity were rife of women violated of
defenceless civilians being shot down for no object except to terrorise
and to bring home to the Belgians the unwisdom of presuming to cross the
will of the sovereign people Tonight in the evening papers there had
been a fresh batch of these revolting stories and when Michael entered
the studio where Sylvia and her mother were sitting he saw the girl let
drop behind the sofa the paper she had been reading He guessed what she
must have found there for he had already seen the paper himself and
her silence her distraction and the misery of her face confirmed his
conjecture

Ive brought you a little news tonight he said The first draft
from the regiment went off today

Mrs Falbe put down her book marking the place

Well that does look like business then she said though I must say
I should feel safer if they didnt send our soldiers away Where have
they gone to

Destination unknown said Michael But its France My cousin has
gone

Francis asked Sylvia Oh how wicked to send boys like that

Michael saw that her nerves were sharply on edge She had given him no
greeting and now as he sat down she moved a little away from him She
seemed utterly unlike herself

Mother has been told that every Englishman is as brave as two Germans
she said She likes that

Yes dear observed Mrs Falbe placidly It makes one feel safer I
saw it in the paper though I read it

Sylvia turned on Michael

Have you seen the evening paper she asked

Michael knew what was in her mind

I just looked at it he said There didnt seem to be much news

No only reports rumours lies said Sylvia

Mrs Falbe got up It was her habit to leave the two alone together
since she was sure they preferred that incidentally also she got on
better with her book for she found conversation rather distracting But
tonight Sylvia stopped her

Oh dont go yet mother she said It is very early

It was clear that for some reason she did not want to be left alone with
Michael for never had she done this before Nor did it avail anything
now for Mrs Falbe who was quite determined to pursue her reading
without delay moved towards the door

But I am sure Michael wants to talk to you dear she said and you
have not seen him all day I think I shall go up to bed

Sylvia made no further effort to detain her but when she had gone the
silence in which they had so often sat together had taken on a perfectly
different quality

And what have you been doing she said Tell me about your day No
dont I know it has all been concerned with war and I dont want to
hear about it

I dined with Aunt Barbara said Michael She sent you her love She
also wondered why you hadnt been to see her for so long

Sylvia gave a short laugh which had no touch of merriment in it

Did she really she asked I should have thought she could have
guessed She set every nerve in my body jangling last time I saw her by
the way she talked about Germans And then suddenly she pulled herself
up and apologised saying she had forgotten That made it worse
Michael when you are unhappy kindness is even more intolerable than
unkindness I would sooner have Lady Barbara abusing my people than
saying how sorry she is for me Dont lets talk about it Lets do
something Will you play or shall I sing Lets employ ourselves

Michael followed her lead

Ah do sing he said Its weeks since I have heard you sing

She went quickly over to the bookcase of music by the piano

Come then lets sing and forget she said Hermann always said the
artist was of no nationality Lets begin quick These are all German
songs dont lets have those Ah and these too Whats to be done
All our songs seem to be German

Michael laughed

But weve just settled that artists have no nationality so I suppose
art hasnt either he said

Sylvia pulled herself together conscious of a want of control and laid
her hand on Michaels shoulder

Oh Michael what should I do without you she said And yetwell
let me sing

She had placed a volume of Schubert on the musicstand and opening it
at random he found Du Bist die Ruhe She sang the first verse but in
the middle of the second she stopped

I cant she said Its no use

He turned round to her

Oh Im so sorry he said But you know that

She moved away from him and walked down to the empty fireplace

I cant keep silence she said though I know we settled not to talk
of those things when necessarily we cannot feel absolutely at one But
just before you came in I was reading the evening paper Michael how
can the English be so wicked as to print and I suppose to believe
those awful things I find there You told me you had glanced at it
Well did you glance at the lies they tell about German atrocities

Yes I saw them said Michael But its no use talking about them

But arent you indignant she said Doesnt your blood boil to read
of such infamous falsehoods You dont know Germans but I do and it is
impossible that such things can have happened

Michael felt profoundly uncomfortable Some of these stories which
Sylvia called lies were vouched for apparently by respectable
testimony

Why talk about them he said Im sure we were wise when we settled
not to

She shook her head

Well I cant live up to that wisdom she said When I think of this
war day and night and night and day how can I prevent talking to
you about it And those lies Germans couldnt do such things Its a
campaign of hate against us set up by the English Press

I daresay the German Press is no better said Michael

If that is so I should be just as indignant about the German Press
said she But it is only your guess that it is so

Suddenly she stopped and came a couple of steps nearer him

Michael it isnt possible that you believe those things of us she
said

He got up

Ah do leave it alone Sylvia he said I know no more of the truth
or falsity of it than you I have seen just what you have seen in the
papers

You dont feel the impossibility of it then she asked

No I dont There seems to have been sworn testimony War is a cruel
thing I hate it as much as you When men are maddened with war you
cant tell what they would do They are not the Germans you know nor
the Germans I know who did such thingsnot the people I saw when I
was with Hermann in Baireuth and Munich a year ago They are no more the
same than a drunken man is the same as that man when he is sober They
are two different people drink has made them different And war has
done the same for Germany

He held out his hand to her She moved a step back from him

Then you think I suppose that Hermann may be concerned in those
atrocities she said

Michael looked at her in amazement

You are talking sheer nonsense Sylvia he said

Not at all It is a logical inference just an application of the
principle you have stated

Michaels instinct was just to take her in his arms and make the
final appeal saying We love each other thats all but his reason
prevented him Sylvia had said a monstrous thing in cold blood when she
suggested that he thought Hermann might be concerned in these deeds and
in cold blood not by appealing to her emotions must she withdraw that

Im not going to argue about it he said I want you to tell me at
once that I am right that it was sheer nonsense to put no other name
to it when you suggested that I thought that of Hermann

Oh pray put another name to it she said

Very well It was a wanton falsehood said Michael and you know it

Truly this hellish nightmare of war and hate which had arisen brought
with it a brood not less terrible A day ago an hour ago he would have
merely laughed at the possibility of such a situation between Sylvia and
himself Yet here it was they were in the middle of it now

She looked up at him flashing with indignation and a retort as stinging
as his rose to her lips And then quite suddenly all her anger went
from her as her heart told her in a voice that would not be silenced
the complete justice of what he had said and the appeal that Michael
refrained from making was made by her to herself Remorse held her on
its spikes for her abominable suggestion and with it came a sense
of utter desolation and misery of hatred for herself in having thus
quietly and deliberately said what she had said She could not account
for it nor excuse herself on the plea that she had spoken in passion
for she had spoken as he felt in cold blood Hence came the misery in
the knowledge that she must have wounded Michael intolerably

Her lips so quivered that when she first tried to speak no words would
come That she was truly ashamed brought no relief no ease to her
surrender for she knew that it was her real self who had spoken thus
incredibly But she could at least disown that part of her

I beg your pardon Michael she said I was atrocious Will you
forgive me Because I am so miserable

He had nothing but love for her love and its kinsman pity

Oh my dear fancy you asking that he said

Just for the moment of their reconciliation it seemed to both that they
came closer to each other than they had ever been before and the chance
of the need of any such another reconciliation was impossible to the
verge of laughableness so that before five minutes were past he could
make the smile break through her tears at the absurdity of the moment
that now seemed quite unreal Yet that which was at the root of their
temporary antagonism was not removed by the reconciliation at most
they had succeeded in cutting off the poisonous shoot that had suddenly
sprouted from it The truth of this in the days that followed was
horribly demonstrated

It was not that they ever again came to the spoken bitterness of words
for the sharpness of them once experienced was shunned by each of
them but times without number they had to sheer off and not approach
the ground where these poisoned tendrils trailed And in that sense of
having to take care to be watchful lest a chance word should bring the
peril close to them the atmosphere of complete ease and confidence
in which alone love can flourish was tainted Love was there but its
flowers could not expand it could not grow in the midst of this bitter
air And what made the situation more and increasingly difficult was
the fact that next to their love for each other the emotion that
most filled the mind of each was this sense of raceantagonism It was
impossible that the news of the war should not be mentioned for that
would have created an intolerable unreality and all that was in their
power was to avoid all discussion to suppress from speech all the
feelings with which the news filled them Every day too there came
fresh stories of German abominations committed on the Belgians and each
knew that the other had seen them and yet neither could mention them
For while Sylvia could not believe them Michael could not help doing
so and thus there was no common ground on which they could speak of
them Often Mrs Falbe in whose blood it would seem no sense of
race beat at all would add to the embarrassment by childlike comments
saying at one time in reference to such things that she made a point of
not believing all she saw in the newspapers or at another ejaculating
Well the Germans do seem to have behaved very cruelly again But no
emotion appeared to colour these speeches while all the emotion of the
world surged and bubbled behind the silence of the other two

Then followed the darkest days that England perhaps had ever known when
the German armies having overcome the resistance of Belgium suddenly
swept forward again across France pushing before them like the jetsam
and flotsam on the rim of the advancing tide the allied armies Often in
these appalling weeks Michael would hesitate as to whether he should go
to see Sylvia or not so unbearable seemed the fact that she did not and
could not feel or understand what England was going through So far
from blaming her for it he knew that it could not be otherwise for her
blood called to her even as his to him while somewhere in the onrush
of those advancing and devouring waves was her brother with whom so it
had often seemed to him she was one soul Thus while in that his whole
sympathy and whole comprehension of her love was with him there was as
well all that deep silent English patriotism of which till now he had
scarcely been conscious praying with mute entreaty that disaster and
destruction and defeat might overwhelm those advancing hordes Once
when the anxiety and peril were at their height he made up his mind not
to see her that day and spent the evening by himself But later when
he was actually on his way to bed he knew he could not keep away from
her and though it was already midnight he drove down to Chelsea and
found her sitting up waiting for the chance of his coming

For a moment as she greeted him and he kissed her silently they
escaped from the encompassing horror

Ah you have come she said I thought perhaps you might I have
wanted you dreadfully

The roar of artillery the internecine strife were still Just for a
few seconds there was nothing in the world for him but her nor for her
anything but him

I couldnt go to bed without just seeing you he said I wont keep
you up

They stood with hands clasped

But if you hadnt come Michael she said I should have understood

And then the roar and the horror began again Her words were the
simplest the most directly spoken to him yet could not but evoke the
spectres that for the moment had vanished She had meant to let her
love for him speak it had spoken and instantly through the momentary
sunlight of it there loomed the fierce and enormous shadow It could
not be banished from their most secret hearts even when the doors
were shut and they were alone together thus it made its entrance
ghostlike terrible and all loves bolts and bars could not keep it
out Here was the tragedy of it that they could not stand embraced with
clasped hands and look at it together and so rob it of its terrors for
at the sight of it their hands were loosened from each others and in
its presence they were forced to stand apart In his heart as surely
as he knew her love Michael knew that this great shadow under which
England lay was shot with sunlight for Sylvia that the anxiety the
awful suspense that made his fingers cold as he opened the daily papers
brought into it to her an echo of victorious music that beat to the
tramp of advancing feet that marched ever forward leaving the glittering
Rhine leagues upon leagues in their rear The Bavarian corps in which
Hermann served was known to be somewhere on the Western front for
the Emperor had addressed them ten days before on their departure from
Munich and Sylvia and Michael were both aware of that But they
who loved Hermann best could not speak of it to each other and the
knowledge of it had to be hidden in silence as if it had been some
guilty secret in which they were the terrified accomplices instead of
its being a bond of love which bound them both to Hermann

In addition to the national anxiety there was the suspense of those
whose sons and husbands and fathers were in the fighting line Columns
of casualty lists were published and each name appearing there was a
sword that pierced a home One such list published early in September
was seen by Michael as he drove down on Sunday morning to spend the rest
of the day with Sylvia and the first name that he read there was that
of Francis For a moment as he remembered afterwards the print had
danced before his eyes as if seen through the quiver of hot air Then
it settled down and he saw it clearly

He turned and drove back to his rooms in Half Moon Street feeling that
strange craving for loneliness that shuns any companionship He must
for a little sit alone with the fact face it adjust himself to it
Till that moment when the dancing print grew still again he had not in
all the anxiety and suspense of those days thought of Franciss death
as a possibility even He had heard from him only two mornings before
in a letter thoroughly characteristic that saw as Francis always saw
the pleasant and agreeable side of things Washing he had announced
was a delusion after a week without it you began to wonder why you had
ever made a habit of it    They had had a lot of marching always
in the wrong direction but everyone knew that would soon be over   
Wasnt London very beastly in August    Would Michael see if he
could get some proper cigarettes out to him Here there was nothing but
little black French affairs and not many of them which tied a knot in
the throat of the smoker    And now Francis with all his gaiety
and his affection and his light pleasant dealings with life lay dead
somewhere on the sunny plains of France killed in action by shell
or bullet in the midst of his youth and strength and joy in life to
gratify the damned dreams of the man who had been the honoured guest
at Ashbridge and those who had advised and flattered and at the end
perhaps just used him as their dupe To their insensate greed and
swollenheaded lust for worldpower was this hecatomb of sweet and
pleasant lives offered and in their onward course through the vines
and corn of France they waded through the blood of the slain whose only
crime was that they had dared to oppose the will of Germany as voiced
by the War Lord And as milestones along the way they had come were set
the records of their infamy in rapine and ruthless slaughter of the
innocent Just at first as he sat alone in his room Michael but
contemplated images that seemed to form in his mind without his
volition and emotionnumb from the shock they seemed external to
him Sometimes he had a vision of Francis lying without mark or wound or
violence on him in some vineyard on the hillside with face as quiet
as in sleep turned towards a moonlit sky Then came another picture and
Francis was walking across the terrace at Ashbridge with his gun
over his shoulder towards Lord Ashbridge and the Emperor who stood
together just as Michael had seen the three of them when they came
in from the shootingparty As Francis came near the Emperor put a
cartridge into his gun and shot him    Yes that was it that was
what had happened The marvellous peacemaker of Europe the fireengine
who as Hermann had said was ready to put out all conflagrations
the fatuous mountebank who pretended to be a friend to England who
conducted his own balderdash which he called music had changed his role
and shown his black heart and was out to kill

Wild panoramas like these streamed through Michaels head as if
projected there by some magic lantern and while they lasted he was
conscious of no grief at all but only of a devouring hate for the mad
lawless butchers who had caused Franciss death and willingly at that
moment if he could have gone out into the night and killed a German and
met his death himself in the doing of it he would have gone to his
doom as to a bridalbed But by degrees as the stress of these unsought
imaginings abated his thoughts turned to Francis himself again who
through all his boyhood and early manhood had been to him a sort of
ideal and inspiration How he had loved and admired him yet never with
a touch of jealousy And Francis whose letter lay open by him on the
table lay dead on the battlefields of France There was the envelope
with the red square mark of the censor upon it and the sheet with its
gay scrawl in pencil asking for proper cigarettes And with a pang
of remorse all the more vivid because it concerned so trivial a thing
Michael recollected that he had not sent them He had meant to do so
yesterday afternoon but something had put it out of his head Never
again would Francis ask him to send out cigarettes Michael laid his
head on his arms so that his face was close to that pencilled note and
the relief of tears came to him

Soon he raised himself again not ashamed of his sorrow but somehow
ashamed of the black hate that before had filled him That was gone for
the present anyhow and Michael was glad to find it vanished Instead
there was an aching pity not for Francis alone nor for himself but for
all those concerned in this hideous business A hundred and a thousand
homes thrown suddenly today into mourning were there no doubt there
were houses in that Bavarian village in the pine woods above which he
and Hermann had spent the day when there was no opera at Baireuth where
a son or a brother or a father were mourned and in the kinship of
sorrow he found himself at peace with all who had suffered loss with
all who were living through days of deadly suspense There was nothing
effeminate or sentimental about it he had never been manlier than in
this moment when he claimed his right to be one with them It was right
to pause like this with his hand clasped in the hands of friends and
foes alike But without disowning that he knew that Franciss death
which had brought that home to him had made him eager also for his own
turn to come when he would go out to help in the grim work that lay in
front of him He was perfectly ready to die if necessary and if not to
kill as many Germans as possible And somehow the two aspects of it
all the pity and the desire to kill existed side by side neither
overlapping nor contradicting one another


His servant came into the room with a pencilled note which he opened
It was from Sylvia

Oh Michael I have just called and am waiting to know if you will see
me I have seen the news and I want to tell you how sorry I am But if
you dont care to see me I know you will say so wont you

Though an hour before he had turned back on his way to go to Sylvia he
did not hesitate now

Yes ask Miss Falbe to come up he said

She came up immediately and once again as they met the world and the
war stood apart from them

I did not expect you to come Michael she said when I saw the news
I did not mean to come here myself Butbut I had to I had just to
find out whether you wouldnt see me and let me tell you how sorry I
am

He smiled at her as they stood facing each other

Thank you for coming he said Im so glad you came But I had to be
alone just a little

I didnt do wrong she asked

Indeed you didnt I did wrong not to come to you I loved Francis you
see

Already the shadow threatened again It was just the fact that he loved
Francis that had made it impossible for him to go to her and he could
not explain that And as the shadow began to fall she gave a little
shudder

Oh Michael I know you did she said Its just that which concerns
us that and my sympathy for you He was such a dear I only saw him
I know once or twice but from that I can guess what he was to you He
was a brother to youaaHermann

Michael felt with Sylvias hand in his they were both running
desperately away from the shadow that pursued them Desperately he tried
with her to evade it But every word spoken between them seemed but to
bring it nearer to them

I only came to say that she said I had to tell you myself to see
you as I told you so that you could know how sincere how heartfelt

She stopped suddenly

Thats all my dearest she added I will go away again now

Across that shadow that had again fallen between them they looked and
yearned for each other

No dont godont go he said I want you more than ever We are
here here and now you and I and what else matters in comparison of
that I loved Francis as you know and I love Hermann but there is our
love the greatest thing of all Weve got itits here Oh Sylvia we
must be wise and simple we must separate things sort them out not let
them get mixed with one another We can do it I know we can Theres
nothing outside us nothing mattersnothing matters

There was just that ray of sun peering over the black cloud that
illumined their faces to each other while already the sharp peaked
shadow of it had come between them For that second while he spoke it
seemed possible that in the middle of welter and chaos and death and
enmity these two souls could stand apart in the passionate serene of
love and the moment lasted for just as long as she flung herself into
his arms And then even while her face was pressed to his and while
the riotous blood of their pressed lips sang to them the shadow fell
across them Even as he asserted the inviolability of the sanctuary in
which they stood he knew it to be an impossible Utopiathat he should
find with her the peace that should secure them from the raging storm
the cold shadowand the loosening of her arms about his neck but
endorsed the message of his own heart For such heavenly security cannot
come except to those who have been through the ultimate bitterness that
the world can bring it is not arrived at but through complete surrender
to the trial of fire and as yet in spite of their opposed patriotism
in spite of her sincerest sympathy with Michaels loss the assault
on the most intimate lines of the fortress had not yet been delivered
Before they could reach the peace that passed understanding a fiercer
attack had to be repulsed they had to stand and look at each other
unembittered across waves and billows of a salter Marah than this

But still they clung while in their eyes there passed backwards and
forwards the message that said It is not yet it is not thus They
had been like two children springing together at the report of some
thunderclap not knowing in the presence of what elemental outpouring
of force they hid their faces together As yet it but boomed on the
horizon though messages of its havoc reached them and the test would
come when it roared and lightened overhead Already the tension of the
approaching tempest had so wrought on them that for a month past they
had been unreal to each other wanting ease wanting confidence and
now when the first real shock had come though for a moment it threw
them into each others arms this was not as they knew the real the
final reconciliation the touchstone that proved the gold Franciss
death the cousin whom Michael loved at the hands of one of the nation
to whom Sylvia belonged had momentarily made them feel that all else
but their love was but external circumstance and even in the moment
of their feeling this the shadow fell again and left them chilly and
shivering

For a moment they still held each other round the neck and shoulder
then the hold slipped to the elbow and soon their hands parted As yet
no word had been said since Michael asserted that nothing else mattered
and in the silence of their gradual estrangement the sanguine falsity of
that grew and grew and grew

I know what you feel she said at length and I feel it also

Her voice broke and her hands felt for his again

Michael where are you she cried No dont touch me I didnt mean
that Lets face it For all we know Hermann might have killed Francis
   Whether he did or not doesnt matter It might have been Its
like that

A minute before Michael in soul and blood and mind and bones had said
that nothing but Sylvia and himself had any real existence He had clung
to her even as she to him hoping that this individual love would
prove itself capable of overriding all else that existed But it had not
needed that she should speak to show him how pathetically he had erred
Before she had made a concrete instance he knew how hopeless his wish
had been the silence the loosening of hands had told him that And
when she spoke there was a brutality in what she said and worse than
the brutality there was a plain unvarnished truth

There was no question now of her going away at once as she had
proposed any more than a boat in the rapids roared round by breakers
can propose to start again They were in the middle of it and so
short a way ahead was the cataract that ran with blood On each side
at present were fine green landingplaces he at the oar she at the
tiller could if they were of one mind still put ashore could run
their boat in declining the passage of the cataract with all its risks
its river of blood There was but a stroke of the oar to be made a pull
on a rope of the rudder and a step ashore Here was a way out of the
storm and the rapids

A moment before when by their physical parting they had realised
the strength of the bonds that held them apart this solution had not
occurred to Sylvia Now critically and forlornly hopeful it flashed
on her She felt she almost feltfor the ultimate decision rested with
himthat with him she would throw everything else aside and escape
just escape if so he willed it into some haven of neutrality where
he and she would be together leaving the rest of the world her country
and his to fight over these irreconcilable quarrels It did not seem to
matter what happened to anybody else provided only she and Michael were
together out of risk out of harm Other lives might be precious other
ideals and patriotisms might be at stake but she wanted to be with him
and nothing else at all No tie counted compared to that there was but
one life given to man and woman and now that her individual happiness
the individual joy of her love was at stake she felt even as Michael
had said that nothing else mattered that they would be right to
realise themselves at any cost

She took his hands again

Listen to me Michael she said I cant bear any longer that these
horrors should keep rising up between us and while we are here in the
middle of it all it cant be otherwise I ask you then to come away
with me to leave it all behind It is not our quarrel Already Hermann
has gone I cant lose you too

She looked up at him for a moment and then quickly away again for she
felt her case which seemed to her just now so imperative slipping away
from her in that glance she got of his eyes that for all the love that
burned there were blank with astonishment She must convince him but
her own convictions were weak when she looked at him

Dont answer me yet she said Hear what I have to say Dont you
see that while we are like this we are lost to each other And as you
yourself said just now nothing matters in comparison to our love I
want you to take me away out of it all so that we can find each other
again These horrors thwart and warp us they spoil the best thing that
the world holds for us My patriotism is just as sound as yours but
I throw it away to get you Do the same then You can get out of your
service somehow   

And then her voice began to falter

If you loved me you would do it she said If

And then suddenly she found she could say no more at all She had hoped
that when she stated these things she would convince him and behold
all she had done was to shake her own convictions so that they fell
clattering round her like an unstable cardhouse Desperately she looked
again at him wondering if she had convinced him at all and then again
she looked wondering if she should see contempt in his eyes After that
she stood still and silent and her face flamed

Do you despise me Michael she said

He gave a little sigh of utter content

Oh my dear how I love you for suggesting such a sweet impossibility
he said But how you would despise me if I consented

She did not answer

Wouldnt you he repeated

She gave a sorrowful semblance of a laugh

I suppose I should she said

And I know you would You would contrast me in your mind whether
you wished to or not with Hermann with poor Francis sorely to my
disadvantage

They sat silent a little but there was another question Sylvia had to
ask for which she had to collect her courage At last it came

Have they told you yet when you are going she said

Not for certain Butit will be before many days are passed And the
question ariseswill you marry me before I go

She hid her face on his shoulder

I will do what you wish she said

But I want to know your wish

She clung closer to him

Michael I dont think I could bear to part with you if we were
married she said It would be worse I think than its going to be
But I intend to do exactly what you wish You must tell me Im going to
obey you before I am your wife as well as after

Michael had long debated this in his mind It seemed to him that if
he came back as might easily happen hopelessly crippled incurably
invalid it would be placing Sylvia in an unfairly difficult position
if she was already his wife He might be hideously disfigured she would
be bound to but a wreck of a man he might be utterly unfit to be her
husband and yet she would be tied to him He had already talked the
question over with his father who with that curious posthumous anxiety
to have a further direct heir had urged that the marriage should take
place at once but with his own feeling on the subject as well as
Sylvias he at once made up his mind

I agree with you he said We will settle it so then

She smiled at him

How dreadfully businesslike she said with an attempt at lightness

I know Its rather a good thing one has got to be businesslike
when

That failed also and he drew her to him and kissed her


CHAPTER XVI


Michael was sitting in the kitchen of a French farmhouse just outside
the village of Laires some three miles behind the English front The
kitchen door was open and on the flagged floor was cast an oblong of
primrosecoloured November sunshine warm and pleasant so that the
bluebottle flies buzzed hopefully about it settling occasionally on
the cracked green door where they cleaned their wings and generally
furbished themselves up as if the warmth was that of a spring day that
promised summer to follow They were there in considerable numbers
for just outside in the cobbled yard was a heap of manure where they
hungrily congregated Against the whitewashed wall of the house there
lay a fat sow basking contentedly and snorting in her dreams The
yard bounded on two sides by the house walls was shut in on the third
by a row of farmsheds and the fourth was open Just outside it stood
a small copse half flooded with the brimming water of a sluggish stream
that meandered by the side of the farmroad leading out of the yard
which turned to the left and soon joined the highway This farmroad
was partly under water though not deeply so that by skirting along its
raised banks it was possible to go dryshod to the highway underneath
which the stream passed in a brick culvert

Through the kitchen window set opposite the door could be seen a broad
stretch of country of the fenland type flat and bare and intersected
with dykes where sedges stirred slightly in the southerly breeze Here
and there were pools of overflowed rivulets and here and there were
plantations of stunted hornbeam the russet leaves of which still
clung thickly to them But in the main it was a bare and empty land
featureless and stolid

Just below the kitchen window there was a plot of cultivated ground
thriftily and economically used for the growing of vegetables
Concession however was made to the sense of brightness and beauty for
on each side of the path leading up to the door ran a row of Michaelmas
daisies rather battered by the fortnight of rain which had preceded
this day of still warm sun but struggling bravely to shake off the
effect of the adverse conditions under which they had laboured

The kitchen itself was extremely clean and orderly Its flagged floor
was still damp and brown in patches from the washing it had received two
hours before but the draught between open window and open door was fast
drying it Down the centre of the room was a deal table without a cloth
on which were laid some halfdozen places each marked with a knife and
fork and spoon and a thick glass ready for the serving of the midday
meal On the whitewashed walls hung two photographs of family groups
in one of which appeared the father and mother and three little
children in the other the same personages some ten years later and a
lithograph of the Blessed Virgin On each side of the table was a
deal bench at the head and foot two wooden armchairs A dresser stood
against the wall on the floor by the oven was a frayed rug and most
important of all to Michaels mind was a big stewpot that stood on
the top of the oven From time to time a fat comfortable Frenchwoman
bustled in and took off the lid of this to stir it or placed on the
dresser a plate of cheese or a loaf of freshly cooked brown bread Two
or three of Michaels brotherofficers were there one sitting in the
patch of sunlight with his back against the green door another on the
step outside The post had come in not long before and all of them
Michael included were occupied with letters and papers

Today there happened to be no letters for Michael and the paper which
he glanced at seemed a very feeble effort in the way of entertainment
There was no news in it except news about the war which here out at
the front did not interest him in the least Perhaps in England people
liked to know that a hundred yards of trenches had been taken at one
place and that three German attacks had failed at another but when
you were actually engaged or had been or would soon again be in taking
part in those things it seemed a waste of paper and compositors
time to record them There was a column of letters also from indignant
Britons using violent language about the crimes and treachery of
Germany That also was uninteresting and farfetched Nothing that
Germany had done mattered the least There was no use in arguing and
slinging wild expressions about it was a stale subject altogether
when you were within earshot of that incessant booming of guns All the
morning that had gone on without break and no doubt they would get news
of what had happened before they set out again that evening for another
spell in the trenches But in all probability nothing particular had
happened Probably the London papers would record it next day a further
tediousness on their part It would be much more interesting to hear
what was going on there whether there were any new plays whether there
had been any fresh concerts what the weather was like or even who had
been lunching at Princes or dining at the Carlton

He put down his uninteresting paper and strolled out into the farmyard
stepping over the legs of the junior officer who blocked the doorway
and did not attempt to move On the doorstep was sitting a major of his
regiment who more politely shifted his place a little so that Michael
should pass Outside the smell of manure was acrid but not unpleasant
the old sow grunted in her sleep and one of the green shutters outside
the upper windows slowly blew to There was someone inside the room
apparently for the moment after a hand and arm bare to the elbow were
protruded and fastened the latch of the shutter so that it should not
move again

A little further on was a rail that separated the copse from the
roadway and here out of the wind Michael sat down and lit a cigarette
to stop his yearning for the bubbling stewpot which would not be
broached for half an hour yet The day he believed was Wednesday
but the whole quiet of the place apart from that drowsy booming on
the eastern horizon made it feel like Sunday Nobody but the fat
Frenchwoman who bustled about had anything to do there was a Sabbath
leisure about everything about the dozing sow the buzzing flies the
lounging figures that read letters and papers When last they were here
it is true there were rather more of them Eight officers had been
billeted here last week before they had been in the trenches and now
there were but six This evening they would set out again for another
fortyeight hours in that hellish inferno but tomorrow a fresh draft
was arriving so that when next they foregathered here whatever had
happened in the interval there would probably be at least six of them

It did not seem to matter much what six there would be or whether there
would be more than six or less All that mattered at this moment as he
inhaled the first incense of his cigarette was that the rain was
over for the present that the sun shone from a blue sky that he felt
extraordinarily well and tranquil and that dinner would soon be
ready But of all these agreeable things what pleased him most was the
tranquillity to be alive here with the manure heap steaming in the
sun and the sow asleep by the house wall and swallows settling on the
eaves was Paradise enow Somewhere deep down in him were streams of
yearning and of horror flowing like an underground river in the dark
He yearned for Sylvia he thought with horror of the two days in the
trenches that had preceded this rest in the whitewashed farmhouse and
with horror he thought of the days and nights that would succeed it But
both horror and yearnings were stupefied by the content that flooded the
present moment No doubt it was reaction from what had gone before but
the reaction was complete Just now he asked for nothing but to sit in
the sun and smoke his cigarette and wait for dinner As far as he knew
he did not think of anything particular he just existed in the sun

The wind must have shifted a little for before long it came round
the corner of the house and slightly spoiled the mellow warmth of the
sunshine This would never do The Epicurean in him revolted at the idea
of losing a moment of this complete wellbeing and arguing that if the
wind blew here it must be dead calm below the kitchen window on the
other side of the house he got off his rail and walked along the
slippery bank at the edge of the flooded road in order to go there It
was hard to keep his footing here and his progress was slow but he
felt he would take any amount of trouble to avoid getting his feet wet
in the flooded road Then there was a patch of kitchengarden to cross
where the mud clung rather annoyingly to his instep and having gained
the garden path he very carefully wiped his boots and with a fallen
twig dug away the clots of soil that stuck to the instep

He found that he had been quite right in supposing that the air would
be windless here and full of great content he sat down with his back
to the house wall A tortoiseshell butterfly encouraged by the warmth
was flitting about among the Michaelmas daisies that bordered the path
and settling on them opening its wings to the genial sun Two or three
bees buzzed there also the summerlike tranquillity inserted into the
middle of November squalls and rain deluded them as well as Michael
into living completely in the present hour Gnats hovered about One
settled on Michaels hand where he instantly killed it and was sorry
he had done so For the time the booming of guns which had sounded
incessantly all the morning to the east stopped altogether and
absolute quiet reigned Had he not been so hungry and so unable to get
the idea of the stewpot out of his head Michael would have been content
to sit with his back to the sunwarmed wall for ever

The highroad raised and embanked above the lowlying fields ran
eastwards in an undeviating straight line Just opposite the farm were
the last outlying huts of the village and from there onwards it lay
untenanted But before many minutes were passed the quiet of the autumn
noon began to be overscored by distant humming faint at first and then
quickly growing louder and he saw far away a little brown speck coming
swiftly towards him It turned out to be a dispatchrider mounted on a
motorbicycle who with a hoot of his horn roared westward through
the village Immediately afterwards another humming steadier and
more sonorous grew louder and Michael recognising it looked up
instinctively into the blue sky overhead as an English aeroplane
flying low came from somewhere behind and passed directly over him
going eastwards Before long it stopped its direct course and began to
mount in spirals and when at a sufficient height it resumed its onward
journey towards the German lines Then three or four privates billeted
in the village and now resting after duty in the trenches strolled
along the road laughing and talking They sat down not a hundred yards
from Michael and one began to whistle Tipperary Another and another
took it up until all four were engaged on it It was not precisely
in tune nor were the performers in unison but it produced a vaguely
pleasant effect and if not in tune with the notes as the composer wrote
them the sight and sound of those four whistling and idle soldiers was
in tune with the air of security of Sunday morning

Something far down the road caught Michaels eye some moving line
of brown wagons As they came nearer he saw that they were the
motorambulances of the Red Cross moving slowly along the ruts and
holes which the traffic had worn so that the occupants should suffer
as little jolting as was possible They carried no doubt the wounded who
had been taken from the trenches last night and now after calling
for them at the first dressing station in the rear of the lines were
removing them to hospital As they passed the four men sitting by the
roadside one of them shouted Cheer oh mates and then they fell
to whistling Tipperary again Then oh blessed moment the fat
Frenchwoman looked out of the kitchen window just above his head

Diner msieu she said and Michael without another thought of
ambulance or aeroplane scrambled to his feet Somewhere in the middle
distance of his mind he was sorry that this tranquil morning was over
just as below in the darkness of it there ran those streams of yearning
and of horror but all his ordinary workaday self was occupied with
the immediate prospect of the stewpot It was some sort of a ragout he
knew and he lusted for it Red wine of the country would be there
and cheese and new brown bread    It surprised him to find how
completely his bodily needs and the pleasure of their gratification had
possession of him

They were under orders to go back to the trenches shortly after sunset
and when their meal was over there remained but an hour or two before
they had to start The warmth and glory of the day was already gone
and streamers of cloud were beginning to form over the open sky
All afternoon these thickened till a dull layer of grey had thickly
overspread the heavens and below that arch of vapour that cut off
the sun the wind was blowing chilly With that change in the weather
Michaels mood changed also and the horror of the return to the
trenches began to come to the surface He was not as yet aware of any
physical fear of death or of wound rather the feeling was one of some
mental and spiritual shrinking from the whole of this vast business of
murder where hundreds and thousands of men along the battle front that
stretched halfway across Europe were employed day and night without
having any quarrel with each other in the unsleeping vigilant work of
killing Most of them in all probability were quite decent fellows
like those four who had whistled Tipperary together and yet they were
spending months of young sweet life up to the knees in water in foul
and illsmelling trenches in order to kill others whom they had never
seen except as specks on the sights of their rifles Somewhere behind
that gruesome business as he knew there stood the Cause calm and
serene like some great statue which made this insensate murdering
necessary but just for an hour today as he waited till they had to be
on the move again he found himself unable to make real to his own mind
the existence of that cause and could not see beyond the bloody and
hideous things that resulted from it

Then in this inaction of waiting an attack of mere physical cowardice
seized him and he found himself imagining the mutilation and torture
that perhaps awaited him personally in those deathly ditches He tried
to busy himself with the preparation of the few things that he would
take with him he tried to encourage himself by remembering that in his
previous experiences there he had not been conscious of any fear by
telling himself that these were only the unreal anticipations that were
always ready to pounce on one even before such mildly alarming affairs
as a visit to the dentist but in spite of his efforts he found his
hands growing clammy and cold at the thoughts which beset his brain
What if there happened to him what had happened to another junior
officer who was close to him at the moment when a fragment of shell
turned him from a big gay boy into a writhing bundle at the bottom of
the trench He had lived for a couple of hours like that moaning and
crying out For Gods sake kill me What if more mercifully he was
killed outright so that he would lie there in peace till next night
they removed his body or perhaps had to bury him in the trench itself
with a dozen handfuls of soil cast over him At that he suddenly
realised how passionately he wanted to live to escape from this
infernal butchery to be safe again gloriously or ingloriously it
mattered not which to be with Sylvia once more He told himself that
he had been an utter fool ever to reenter the army again like this
He could certainly have got some appointment as dispatchcarrier or had
himself attached to the headquarters staff or even have shuffled out of
it altogether    But above all he wanted Sylvia he wanted to be
allowed to lead the ordinary human life safely and securely with the
girl he loved and with the musical pursuits that were his passion
He had hated soldiering in times of peace he found now that he was
terrified of it in times of war He felt physically sick as with cold
hands and trembling knees he stood and waited lighting cigarettes and
throwing them away in front of the kitchen fire where the stewpot
was already bubbling again for those lucky devils who would return here
tonight

The Major of his company was sitting in the window watching him though
Michael was unaware of it Suddenly he got up and came across to the
fire and put his hand on his shoulder

Dont mind it Comber he said quietly We all get a touch of it
sometimes But youll find it will pass all right Its the waiting
doing nothing that does it

That touched Michael absolutely in the right place

Thanks awfully sir he said

Not a bit But its damned beastly while it lasts Youll be all right
when we move Dont forget to take your fur coat up if youve got one
We shall have a cold night

Just after sunset they set out marching in the gathering dusk down the
road eastwards where in a mile or two they would strike the huge rabbit
warren of trenches that joined the French line to the north and south
Once or twice they had to open out and go by the margin of the road to
let ambulances or commissariat wagon go by but there was but little
traffic here as the main lines of communication lay on other roads
High above them scarcely visible in the dusk an English aeroplane
droned back from its reconnaissance and once there was the order given
to scatter over the fields as a German Taube passed across them This
caused much laughter and chaff among the men and Michael heard one
say Dove they call it do they Id like to make a pigeonpie of
them doves Soon they scrambled back on to the road again and the
interminable Tipperary was resumed in whistle and song Michael
remembered how Aunt Barbara had heard it at a musichall and had spoken
of it as a new and catchy tune which you could carry away with you
Nowadays it carried you away It had become the audible soul of the
British army

The trench which Michaels company were to occupy for the next
fortyeight hours was in the first firingline and to reach it they had
to pass in single file up a mile of communication trenches from
which on all sides like a vast rabbit warren there opened out other
galleries and passages that led to different parts of this network
of the lines It ran not in a straight line but in short sections with
angles intervening so under no circumstances could any considerable
length of it be enfiladed and was lit here and there by little oil
lamps placed in embrasures in one or other wall of it or for some
distance at a time it was dark except for the vague twilight of the
cloudy sky overhead Then again as they approached the firingline it
would suddenly become intensely bright when from the English lines or
from those of the Germans which lay not more than two hundred yards
in front of them a fireball or starshell was sent up that caused
everything it shone upon to leap into vivid illumination Usually when
this happened there came from one side or the other a volley of rifle
shots that sounded like the crack of stockwhips and once or twice a
bullet passed over their heads with the buzz as of some vicious stinging
insect Here and there where the bottom lay in soft and clayey soil
they walked through mud that came halfway up to the knee and each foot
had to be lifted with an effort and was set free with a smacking suck
Elsewhere if the ground was gravelly the rain which for two days
previously had been incessant had drained off and the going was easy
But whether the path lay over dry or soft places the air was sick with
some stale odour which the breeze that swept across the lines from the
southeast could not carry away There was a perpetual pervading reek
that flowed along from the entrance of trenches to right and left that
reminded Michael of the smell of a football scrimmage on a wet day
laden with the odours of sweat and dripping clothes and something
deadlier and more acrid Sometimes they passed under a section covered
in with boards over which the earth and clods of turf had been
replaced so that reconnoitring aeroplanes should not so easily spy it
out and here from dark excavations the smell hung overpoweringly Now
and then the ground over which they passed yielded uneasily to the foot
where lay only lightly covered over some corpse which it had been
impossible to remove and from time to time they passed a huddled bundle
of khaki not yet taken away But except for the artillery duel that
day they had heard going on that morning the last day or two had been
quiet and the wounded had all been got out and for the most part the
dead also

After a long tramp in this communication trench they made a sharp turn
to the right and entered that which they were going to hold for
the next fortyeight hours Here they relieved the regiment that
had occupied it till now who filed out as they came in Along it at
intervals were excavations dug out in the side some propped up with
boards and posts others where the ground was of sufficiently holding
character just scooped out In front towards the German lines ran a
parapet of excavated earth with occasional peepholes bored in it so
that the sentry going his rounds could look out and see if there was
any sign of movement from opposite without showing his head above the
entrenchment But even this was a matter of some risk since the enemy
had located these peepholes and from time to time fired a shot from a
fixed rifle that came straight through them and buried its bullet in the
hinder wall of the trench Other spyholes were therefore being made
but these were not yet finished and for the present till they were dug
it was necessary to use the old ones The trench like all the others
was excavated in short zigzag lengths so that no point either to
right or left commanded more than a score of yards of it

In front from just outside the parapet to a depth of some twenty yards
stretched the spiderweb of wire entanglements and a little farther
down on the right there had been a copse of hornbeam saplings An
attempt had been made by the enemy during the morning to capture and
entrench this thus advancing their lines but the movement had been
seen and the artillery fire which had been so incessant all the
morning denoted the searching of this and the rendering of it
untenable How thorough that searching had been was clear for that
which had been an acre of wood was now but a heap of timber fit only for
faggots Scarcely a tree was left standing and Michael looking out
of one of the peepholes by the light of a starshell saw that the wire
entanglements were thick with leaves that the wind and the firing had
detached from the broken branches In turn the wire entanglements had
come in for some shelling by the enemy and a squad of men were out now
under cover of the darkness repairing these There was a slight dip in
the ground here and by crouching and lying they were out of sight of
the trenches opposite but there were some snipers in that which had
been a wood from whom there came occasional shots Then from lower
down to the right there came a fusillade from the English lines
suddenly breaking out and after a few minutes as suddenly stopping
again But the sniping from the wood had ceased

Michael did not come on duty till six in the morning and for the
present he had nothing to do except eat his rations and sleep as well as
he could in his dugout He had plenty of room to stretch his legs if he
sat half upright and having taken his Majors advice in the matter of
bringing his fur coat with him he found himself warm enough in spite
of the rather bitter wind that striking an angle in the trench wall
eddied sharply into his retreat to sleep But not less justified than
the advice to bring his fur coat was his Majors assurance that the
attack of the horrors which had seized him after dinner that day would
pass off when the waiting was over Throughout the evening his
nerves had been perfectly steady and when in their progress up the
communication trench they had passed a man half disembowelled by a
fragment of a shell and screaming or when as he trod on one of the
uneasy places an arm had stirred and jerked up suddenly through the
handful of earth that covered it he had no firsthand sense of horror
he felt rather as if those things were happening not to him but to
someone else and that at the most they were strange and odd but no
longer horrible But now when reinforced by food again and comfortable
beneath his fur cloak he let his mind do what it would not checking
it but allowing it its natural internal activity he found that a mood
transcending any he had known yet was his So far from these experiences
being terrifying so far from their being strange and unreal they
suddenly became intensely real and shone with a splendour that he had
never suspected Originally he had been pitchforked by his father into
the army and had left it to seek music Sense of duty had made it easy
for him to return to it at a time of national peril but during all the
bitter anxiety of that he had never as in the light of the perception
that came to him now as the wind whistled round him in the dim lit
darkness had a glimpse of the glory of service to his country Here
out in this small evilsmelling cavern with the whole grim business of
war going on round him he for the first time fully realised the reality
of it all He had been in the trenches before but until now that had
seemed some vague evil dream of which he was incredulous Now in the
darkness the darkness cleared and the knowledge that this was the very
thing itself that a couple of hundred yards away were the lines of the
enemy whose power for the honour of England and for the freedom of
Europe had to be broken utterly filled him with a sense of firm
indescribable joy The minor problems which had worried him the fact
of millions of treasure that might have fed the poor and needy over all
Britain for a score of years being outpoured in fire and steel the
fact of thousands of useful and happy lives being sacrificed of widows
and orphans and childless mothers growing ever a greater companyall
these things terrible to look at if you looked at them alone sank
quietly into their sad appointed places when you looked at the thing
entire His own case sank there too music and life and love for which
he would so rapturously have lived were covered up now and at this
moment he would as rapturously have died if by his death he could
have served in his own infinitesimal degree the cause he fought for

The hours went on whether swiftly or slowly he did not consider
The wind fell and for some minutes a heavy shower of rain plumped
vertically into the trench Once during it a sudden illumination blazed
in the sky and he saw the pebbles in the wall opposite shining with
the freshfalling drops There were a dozen rifleshots and he saw
the sentry who had just passed brushing the edge of his coat against
Michaels hand pause and look out through the spyhole close by and
say something to himself Occasionally he dozed for a little and woke
again from dreaming of Sylvia into complete consciousness of where he
was and of that superb joy that pervaded him By and by these dozings
grew longer and the intervals of wakefulness less and for a couple of
hours before he was roused he slept solidly and dreamlessly

His spell of duty began before dawn and he got up to go his rounds
rather stiff and numb and his sleep seemed to have wearied rather
than refreshed him In that hour of early morning when vitality burns
lowest and the dying part their hold on life the thrill that had
possessed him during the earlier hours of the night had died down He
knew having once felt it that it was there and believed that it would
come when called upon but it had drowsed as he slept and was overlaid
by the sense of the grim inexorable side of the whole business A
disconcerting bullet was plugged through a spyhole the second after
he had passed it it sounded not angry but merely businesslike and
Michael found himself thinking that shots fired in anger as the
phrase went were much more likely to go wide than shots fired calmly
   That in his sleepy brain did not sound nonsense it seemed to
contain some great truth if he could bother to think it out

But for that all was quiet again and he had returned to his dugout
just noticing that the dawn was beginning to break for the clouds
overhead were becoming visible in outline with the light that filtered
through them and on their thinner margin turning rosegrey when the
alarm of an attack came down the line Instantly the huddled sleeping
bodies that lay at the side of the trench started into being and in the
moments pause that followed Michael found himself fumbling at the butt
of his revolver which he had drawn out of its case For that one moment
he heard his heart thumping in his throat and felt his mouth grow
dry with some sudden panic fear that came from he knew not where and
invaded him A qualm of sickness took him something gurgled in his
throat and he spat on the floor of the trench All this passed in one
second for at once he was master of himself again though not master of
a savage joy that thrilled himthe joy of this chance of killing those
who fought against the peace and prosperity of the world There was an
attack coming out of the dark and thank God he was among those who had
to meet it

He gave the order that had been passed to him and on the word this
section of the trench was lined with men ready to pour a volley over the
low parapet He was there too wildly excited close to the spyhole
that now showed as a luminous disc against the blackness of the trench
He looked out of this and in the breaking dawn he saw nothing but
the dark ground of the dip in front and the level lines of the German
trenches opposite Then suddenly the grey emptiness was peopled there
sprang from the earth the advance line of the surprise who began hewing
a way through the entanglements while behind the silhouette of the
trenches was broken into a huddled heaving line of men Then came the
order to fire and he saw men dropping and falling out of sight and
others coming on and yet again others These again fell but others
and now he could see the gleam of bayonets came nearer bursting and
cutting their way through the wires Then from opposite to right and
left sounded the crack of rifles and the man next to Michael gave one
grunt and fell back into the trench moving no more

Just immediately opposite were the few dozen men whose part it was to
cut through the entanglements They kept falling and passing out of
sight while others took their places And then for some reason
Michael found himself singling out just one of these much in advance of
the others who was now close to the parapet He was coming straight on
him and with a leap he cleared the last line of wire and towered above
him Michael shot him with his revolver as he stood but three yards from
him and he fell right across the parapet with head and shoulders inside
the trench And as he dropped Michael shouted Got him and then he
looked It was Hermann

Next moment he had scaled the side of the trench and exerting all
his strength was dragging him over into safety The advance of this
section who were to rush the trench had been stopped and again from
right and left the riflefire poured out on the heads that appeared
above the parapet That did not seem to concern him all he had to do
that moment was to get Hermann out of fire and just as he dragged his
legs over the parapet so that his weight fell firm and solid on to
him he felt what seemed a sharp tap on his right arm and could not
understand why it had become suddenly powerless It dangled loosely from
somewhere above the elbow and when he tried to move his hand he found
he could not

Then came a stab of hideous pain which was over almost as soon as he
had felt it and he heard a man close to him say Are you hit sir

It was evident that this surprise attack had failed for five minutes
afterwards all was quiet again Out of the grey of dawn it had come and
before dawn was rosy it was over and Michael with his right arm numb
but for an occasional twinge of violent agony that seemed to him more
like a scream or a colour than pain was leaning over Hermann who lay
on his back quite still while on his tunic a splash of blood slowly
grew larger Dawn was already rosy when he moved slightly and opened his
eyes

Lieber Gott Michael he whispered his breath whistling in his
throat Good morning old boy


CHAPTER XVII


Three weeks later Michael was sitting in his rooms in Half Moon Street
where he had arrived last night expecting Sylvia Since that attack at
dawn in the trenches he had been in hospital in France while his arm
was mending The bone had not been broken but the muscles had been so
badly torn that it was doubtful whether he would ever recover more than
a very feeble power in it again In any case it would take many months
before he recovered even the most elementary use of it

Those weeks had been a longdrawn continuous nightmare not from the
effect of the injury he had undergone nor from any nervous breakdown
but from the sense of that which inevitably hung over him For he knew
by an inward compulsion of his mind that admitted of no argument that
he had to tell Sylvia all that had happened in those ten minutes while
the grey morning grew rosy This sense of compulsion was deaf to all
reasoning however plausible He knew perfectly well that unless he told
Sylvia who it was whom he had shot at pointblank range as he leaped
the last wire entanglement no one else ever could Hermann was buried
now in the same grave as others who had fallen that morning his name
would be given out as missing from the Bavarian corps to which he
belonged and in time after the war was over she would grow to believe
that she would never see him again

But the sheer impossibility of letting this happen though it entailed
nothing on him except the mere abstention from speech took away the
slightest temptation that silence offered He knew that again and again
Sylvia would refer to Hermann wondering where he was praying for his
safety hoping perhaps even that like Michael he would be wounded and
thus escape from the inferno at the front and it was so absolutely
out of the question that he should listen to this try to offer little
encouragements wonder with her whether he was not safe that even
in his most depressed and shrinking hours he never for a moment
contemplated silence Certainly he had to tell her that Hermann was
dead and to account for the fact that he knew him to be dead And
in the long watches of the wakeful night when his mind moved in the
twilight of drowsiness and fever and pain it was here that a certain
temptation entered For it was easy to say and no one could ever
contradict him that some man near him that one perhaps who had fallen
back with a grunt had killed Hermann on the edge of the trench Humanly
speaking there was no chance at all of that innocent falsehood being
disproved In the scurry and wild confusion of the attack none but he
would remember exactly what had happened and as he thought of that
tossing and turning it seemed to one part of his mind that the
innocence of that falsehood would even be laudable be heroic It would
save Sylvia the horrible shock of knowing that her lover had killed her
brother it would save her all that piercing of the iron into her soul
that must inevitably be suffered by her if she knew the truth And who
could tell what effect the knowledge of the truth would have on her
Michael felt that it was at the least possible that she could never bear
to see him again still less sleep in the arms of the one who had killed
her brother That knowledge even if she could put it out of mind in
pity and sorrow for Michael would surely return and return again
and tear her from him sobbing and trembling There was all to risk
in telling her the truth sorrow and bitterness for her and for him
separation and a lifelong regret were piled up in the balance against
the unknown weight of her love Indeed there was love on both sides of
that balance Who could tell how the gold weighed against the gold

Yet after those drowsy painstreaked nights when the sober light of
dawn crept in at the windows then morning after morning Michael knew
that the inward compulsion was in no way weakened by all the reasons
that he had urged It remained ruthless and tender a still small voice
that was heard after the whirlwind and the fire For the very reason why
he longed to spare Sylvia this knowledge namely that they loved each
other was precisely the reason why he could not spare her Yet it
seemed so wanton so useless so unreasonable to tell her so laden with
a risk both for him and her that no standard could measure But he no
more contemplatedexcept in vain imaginationmaking up some ingenious
story of this kind which would account for his knowledge of Hermanns
death than he contemplated keeping silence altogether It was not
possible for him not to tell her everything though when he pictured
himself doing so he found himself faced by what seemed an inevitable
impossibility Though he did not see how his lips could frame the words
he knew they had to Yet he could not but remember how mere reports in
the paper stories of German cruelty and what not had overclouded the
serenity of their love What would happen when this news no report or
hearsay came to her

He had not heard her foot on the stairs nor did she wait for his
servant to announce her but a little before her appointed time she
burst in upon him midway between smiles and tears all tenderness

Michael my dear my dear she cried what a morning for me For the
first time today when I woke I forgot about the war And your poor
arm How goes it Oh I will take care but I must and will have you in
my arms

He had risen to greet her and softly and gently she put her arms round
his neck drawing his head to her

Oh my Michael she whispered Youve come back to me Lieber Gott
how I have longed for you

Lieber Gott When last had he heard those words He had to tell her
He would tell her in a minute or two Perhaps she would never hold him
like that again He could not part with her at the very moment he had
got her

You look ever so well Michael she said in spite of your wound
Youre so brown and lean and strong And oh how I have wanted you I
never knew how much till you went away

Looking at her feeling her arms round him Michael felt that what he
had to say was beyond the power of his lips to utter And yet here in
her presence the absolute necessity of telling her climbed like some
peak into the ample sunrise far above the darkness and the mists that
hung low about it

And what lots you must have to tell me she said I want to hear
allall

Suddenly Michael put up his left hand and took away from his neck the
arm that encircled it But he did not let go of it He held it in his
hand

I have to tell you one thing at once he said She looked at him and
the smile that burned in her eyes was extinguished From his gesture
from his tone she knew that he spoke of something as serious as their
love

What is it she said Tell me then

He did not falter but looked her full in the face There was no
breaking it to her or letting her go through the gathering suspense of
guessing

It concerns Hermann he said It concerns Hermann and me The last
morning that I was in the trenches there was an attack at dawn from
the German lines They tried to rush our trench in the dark Hermann
led them He got right up to the trench And I shot him I did not know
thank God

Suddenly Michael could not bear to look at her any more He put his arm
on the table by him and leaning his head on it covering his eyes he
went on But his voice up till now quite steady faltered and failed
as the sobs gathered in his throat

He fell across the parapet close to me he said    I lifted him
somehow into our trench    I was wounded then    He lay at the
bottom of the trench Sylvia    And I would to God it had been I who
lay there    Because I loved him    Just at the end he opened
his eyes and saw me and knew me And he saidoh Sylvia Sylviahe
said Lieber Gott Michael Good morning old boy And then he
died    I have told you

And at that Michael broke down utterly and completely for the first time
since the morning of which he spoke and sobbed his heart out while
unseen to him Sylvia sat with hands clasped together and stretched
towards him Just for a little she let him weep his fill but her
yearning for him would not be withstood She knew why he had told her
her whole heart spoke of the hugeness of it

Then once more she laid her arm on his neck

Michael my heart she said

States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
