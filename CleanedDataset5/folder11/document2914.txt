ACT I

 It is halfpast nine of a July evening In a diningroom
 lighted by sconces and apparelled in wallpaper carpet and
 curtains of deep vivid blue the large French windows between
 two columns are open on to a wide terrace beyond which are seen
 trees in darkness and distant shapes of lighted houses On one
 side is a bay window over which curtains are partly drawn
 Opposite to this window is a door leading into the hall At an
 oval rosewood table set with silver flowers fruit and wine
 six people are seated after dinner Back to the bay window is
 STEPHEN MORE the host a man of forty with a finecut face a
 rather charming smile and the eyes of an idealist to his
 right SIR JOHN JULIAN an old soldier with thin brown
 features and grey moustaches to SIR JOHNs right his brother
 the DEAN OF STOUR a tall dark asceticlooking Churchman to
 his right KATHERINE is leaning forward her elbows on the table
 and her chin on her hands staring across at her husband to her
 right sits EDWARD MENDIP a pale man of fortyfive very bald
 with a fine forehead and on his clearcut lips a smile that
 shows his teeth between him and MORE is HELEN JULIAN a pretty
 darkhaired young woman absorbed in thoughts of her own The
 voices are tuned to the pitch of heated discussion as the
 curtain rises


THE DEAN I disagree with you Stephen absolutely entirely
disagree

MORE I cant help it

MENDIP Remember a certain war Stephen Were your chivalrous
notions any good then And what was winked at in an obscure young
Member is anathema for an Under Secretary of State You cant
afford

MORE To follow my conscience Thats new Mendip

MENDIP Idealism can be out of place my friend

THE DEAN The Government is dealing here with a wild lawless race
on whom I must say I think sentiment is rather wasted

MORE God made them Dean

MENDIP I have my doubts

THE DEAN They have proved themselves faithless We have the right
to chastise

MORE If I hit a little man in the eye and he hits me back have I
the right to chastise him

SIR JOHN We didnt begin this business

MORE What With our missionaries and our trading

THE DEAN It is news indeed that the work of civilization may be
justifiably met by murder Have you forgotten Glaive and Morlinson

SIR JOHN Yes And that poor fellow Groome and his wife

MORE They went into a wild country against the feeling of the
tribes on their own business What has the nation to do with the
mishaps of gamblers

SIR JOHN We cant stand by and see our own flesh and blood
illtreated

THE DEAN Does our rule bring blessingor does it not Stephen

MORE Sometimes but with all my soul I deny the fantastic
superstition that our rule can benefit a people like this a nation
of one race as different from ourselves as dark from lightin
colour religion every mortal thing We can only pervert their
natural instincts

THE DEAN That to me is an unintelligible point of view

MENDIP Go into that philosophy of yours a little deeper Stephen
it spells stagnation There are no fixed stars on this earth
Nations cant let each other alone

MORE Big ones could let little ones alone

MENDIP If they could thered be no big ones My dear fellow we
know little nations are your hobby but surely office should have
toned you down

SIR JOHN Ive served my country fifty years and I say she is not
in the wrong

MORE I hope to serve her fifty Sir John and I say she is

MENDIP There are moments when such things cant be said More

MORE Theyll be said by me tonight Mendip

MENDIP In the House

 MORE nods

KATHERINE Stephen

MENDIP Mrs More you mustnt let him Its madness

MORE Rising You can tell people that tomorrow Mendip Give it
a leader in The Parthenon

MENDIP Political lunacy No man in your position has a right to
fly out like this at the eleventh hour

MORE Ive made no secret of my feelings all along Im against
this war and against the annexation we all know it will lead to

MENDIP My dear fellow Dont be so Quixotic We shall have war
within the next twentyfour hours and nothing you can do will stop
it

HELEN Oh No

MENDIP Im afraid so Mrs Hubert

SIR JOHN Not a doubt of it Helen

MENDIP TO MORE And you mean to charge the windmill

 MORE nods

MENDIP Cest magnifique

MORE Im not out for advertisement

MENDIP You will get it

MORE Must speak the truth sometimes even at that risk

SIR JOHN It is not the truth

MENDIP The greater the truth the greater the libel and the greater
the resentment of the person libelled

THE DEAN Trying to bring matters to a blander level My dear
Stephen even if you were rightwhich I denyabout the initial
merits there surely comes a point where the individual conscience
must resign it self to the countrys feeling This has become a
question of national honour

SIR JOHN Well said James

MORE Nations are bad judges of their honour Dean

THE DEAN I shall not follow you there

MORE No Its an awkward word

KATHERINE Stopping THE DEAN Uncle James Please

 MORE looks at her intently

SIR JOHN So youre going to put yourself at the head of the cranks
ruin your career and make me ashamed that youre my soninlaw

MORE Is a man only to hold beliefs when theyre popular Youve
stood up to be shot at often enough Sir John

SIR JOHN Never by my country Your speech will be in all the
foreign presstrust em for seizing on anything against us A
showup before other countries

MORE You admit the showup

SIR JOHN I do not sir

THE DEAN The position has become impossible The state of things
out there must be put an end to once for all Come Katherine back
us up

MORE My country right or wrong Guiltystill my country

MENDIP That begs the question

 KATHERINE rises THE DEAN too stands up

THE DEAN In a low voice Quem Deus volt perdere

SIR JOHN Unpatriotic

MORE Ill have no truck with tyranny

KATHERINE Father doesnt admit tyranny Nor do any of us Stephen

HUBERT JULIAN a tall Soldierlike man has come in

HELEN Hubert

 She gets up and goes to him and they talk together near the
 door

SIR JOHN What in Gods name is your idea Weve forborne long
enough in all conscience

MORE Sir John we great Powers have got to change our ways in
dealing with weaker nations The very dogs can give us lessons
watch a big dog with a little one

MENDIP No no these things are not so simple as all that

MORE Theres no reason in the world Mendip why the rules of
chivalry should not apply to nations at least as well as todogs

MENDIP My dear friend are you to become that hapless kind of
outcast a champion of lost causes

MORE This cause is not lost

MENDIP Right or wrong as lost as ever was cause in all this world
There was never a time when the word patriotism stirred mob
sentiment as it does now Ware Mob Stephenware Mob

MORE Because general sentiments against me Ia public manam to
deny my faith The point is not whether Im right or wrong Mendip
but whether Im to sneak out of my conviction because its unpopular

THE DEAN Im afraid I must go To KATHERINE Goodnight my
dear Ah Hubert He greets HUBERT Mr Mendip I go your way
Can I drop you

MENDIP Thank you Goodnight Mrs More Stop him Its
perdition

 He and THE DEAN go out KATHERINE puts her arm in HELENS and
 takes her out of the room HUBERT remains standing by the door

SIR JOHN I knew your views were extreme in many ways Stephen
but I never thought the husband of my daughter would be a
Peaceatanyprice man

MORE I am not But I prefer to fight some one my own size

SIR JOHN Well I can only hope to God youll come to your senses
before you commit the folly of this speech I must get back to the
War Office Goodnight Hubert

HUBERT Goodnight Father

 SIR JOHN goes out HUBERT stands motionless dejected

HUBERT Weve got our orders

MORE What When dyou sail

HUBERT At once

MORE Poor Helen

HUBERT Not married a year pretty bad luck MORE touches his arm
in sympathy Well Weve got to put feelings in our pockets Look
here Stephendont make that speech Think of Katherinewith the
Dad at the War Office and me going out and Ralph and old George out
there already You cant trust your tongue when youre hot about a
thing

MORE I must speak Hubert

HUBERT No no Bottle yourself up for tonight The next few
hours ll see it begin MORE turns from him If you dont care
whether you mess up your own careerdont tear Katherine in two

MORE Youre not shirking your duty because of your wife

HUBERT Well Youre riding for a fall and a godless mucker itll
be Thisll be no picnic We shall get some nasty knocks out there
Wait and see the feeling here when weve had a force or two cut up in
those mountains Its awful country Those fellows have got modern
arms and are jolly good fighters Do drop it Stephen

MORE Must risk something sometimes Huberteven in my profession

 As he speaks KATHERINE comes in

HUBERT But its hopeless my dear chapabsolutely

 MORE turns to the window HUBERT to his sisterthen with a
 gesture towards MORE as though to leave the matter to her he
 goes out

KATHERINE Stephen Are you really going to speak He nods I ask
you not

MORE You know my feeling

KATHERINE But its our own country We cant stand apart from it
You wont stop anythingonly make people hate you I cant bear
that

MORE I tell you Kit some one must raise a voice Two or three
reversescertain to comeand the whole country will go wild And
one more little nation will cease to live

KATHERINE If you believe in your country you must believe that the
more land and power she has the better for the world

MORE Is that your faith

KATHERINE Yes

MORE I respect it I even understand it butI cant hold it

KATHERINE But Stephen your speech will be a rallying cry to all
the cranks and every one who has a spite against the country
Theyll make you their figurehead MORE smiles They will Your
chance of the Cabinet will goyou may even have to resign your seat

MORE Dogs will bark These things soon blow over

KATHERINE No no If you once begin a thing you always go on and
what earthly good

MORE History wont say And this they did without a single protest
from their public men

KATHERINE There are plenty who

MORE Poets

KATHERINE Do you remember that day on our honeymoon going up Ben
Lawers You were lying on your face in the heather you said it was
like kissing a loved woman There was a lark singingyou said that
was the voice of ones worship The hills were very blue thats why
we had blue here because it was the best dress of our country You
do love her

MORE Love her

KATHERINE Youd have done this for methen

MORE Would you have asked methen Kit

KATHERINE Yes The countrys our country Oh Stephen think
what itll be like for mewith Hubert and the other boys out there
And poor Helen and Father I beg you not to make this speech

MORE Kit This isnt fair Do you want me to feel myself a cur

KATHERINE Breathless IIalmost feel youll be a cur to do it
She looks at him frightened by her own words Then as the footman
HENRY has come in to clear the tablevery low I ask you not

 He does not answer and she goes out

MORE To the servant Later please Henry later

 The servant retires MORE still stands looking down at the
 diningtable then putting his hand to his throat as if to free
 it from the grip of his collar he pours out a glass of water
 and drinks it of In the street outside the bay window two
 street musicians a harp and a violin have taken up their
 stand and after some twangs and scrapes break into music
 MORE goes towards the sound and draws aside one curtain After
 a moment he returns to the table and takes up the notes of the
 speech He is in an agony of indecision

MORE A cur

 He seems about to tear his notes across Then changing his
 mind turns them over and over muttering His voice gradually
 grows louder till he is declaiming to the empty room the
 peroration of his speech

MORE We have arrogated to our land the title Champion of
Freedom Foe of Oppression Is that indeed a bygone glory Is it
not worth some sacrifice of our pettier dignity to avoid laying
another stone upon its grave to avoid placing before the searchlight
eyes of History the spectacle of yet one more piece of national
cynicism We are about to force our will and our dominion on a race
that has always been free that loves its country and its
independence as much as ever we love ours I cannot sit silent
tonight and see this begin As we are tender of our own land so we
should be of the lands of others I love my country It is because
I love my country that I raise my voice Warlike in spirit these
people may bebut they have no chance against ourselves And war on
such however agreeable to the blind moment is odious to the future
The great heart of mankind ever beats in sense and sympathy with the
weaker It is against this great heart of mankind that we are going
In the name of Justice and Civilization we pursue this policy but by
Justice we shall hereafter be judged and by Civilizationcondemned

 While he is speaking a little figure has flown along the
 terrace outside in the direction of the music but has stopped
 at the sound of his voice and stands in the open window
 listeninga darkhaired darkeyed child in a blue
 dressinggown caught up in her hand The street musicians
 having reached the end of a tune are silent

 In the intensity of MORES feeling a wineglass gripped too
 strongly breaks and falls in pieces onto a fingerbowl The
 child starts forward into the room

MORE Olive

OLIVE Who were you speaking to Daddy

MORE Staring at her The wind sweetheart

OLIVE There isnt any

MORE What blew you down then

OLIVE Mysteriously The music Did the wind break the
wineglass or did it come in two in your hand

MORE Now my sprite Upstairs again before Nurse catches you
Fly Fly

OLIVE Oh no Daddy With confidential fervour It feels like
things tonight

MORE Youre right there

OLIVE Pulling him down to her and whispering I must get back
again in secret Hsh

 She suddenly runs and wraps herself into one of the curtains of
 the bay window A young man enters with a note in his hand

MORE Hello Steel

 The street musicians have again begun to play

STEEL From Sir Johnby special messenger from the War Office

MORE Reading the note The ball is opened

 He stands brooding over the note and STEEL looks at him
 anxiously He is a dark sallow thinfaced young man with the
 eyes of one who can attach himself to people and suffer with
 them

STEEL Im glad its begun sir It would have been an awful pity
to have made that speech

MORE You too Steel

STEEL I mean if its actually started

MORE Tearing tie note across Yes Keep that to yourself

STEEL Do you want me any more

 MORE takes from his breast pocket some papers and pitches them
 down on the bureau

MORE Answer these

STEEL Going to the bureau Fetherby was simply sickening He
begins to write Struggle has begun again in MORE Not the faintest
recognition that there are two sides to it

 MORE gives him a quick look goes quietly to the diningtable
 and picks up his sheaf of notes Hiding them with his sleeve
 he goes back to the window where he again stands hesitating

STEEL Chief gem Imitating We must show Impudence at last that
Dignity is not asleep

MORE Moving out on to the terrace Nice quiet night

STEEL This to the Cottage Hospitalshall I say you will preside

MORE No

 STEEL writes then looking up and seeing that MORE is no longer
 there he goes to the window looks to right and left returns
 to the bureau and is about to sit down again when a thought
 seems to strike him with consternation He goes again to the
 window Then snatching up his hat he passes hurriedly out
 along the terrace As he vanishes KATHERINE comes in from the
 hall After looking out on to the terrace she goes to the bay
 window stands there listening then comes restlessly back into
 the room OLIVE creeping quietly from behind the curtain
 clasps her round the waist

KATHERINE O my darling How you startled me What are you doing
down here you wicked little sinner

OLIVE I explained all that to Daddy We neednt go into it again
need we

KATHERINE Where is Daddy

OLIVE Gone

KATHERINE When

OLIVE Oh only just and Mr Steel went after him like a rabbit
The music stops They havent been paid you know

KATHERINE Now go up at once I cant think how you got down here

OLIVE I can Wheedling If you pay them Mummy theyre sure to
play another

KATHERINE Well give them that One more only

 She gives OLIVE a coin who runs with it to the bay window
 opens the aide casement and calls to the musicians

OLIVE Catch please And would you play just one more

 She returns from the window and seeing her mother lost in
 thought rubs herself against her

OLIVE Have you got an ache

KATHARINE Right through me darling

OLIVE Oh

 The musicians strike up a dance

OLIVE Oh Mummy I must just dance

 She kicks off her lisle blue shoes and begins dancing While
 she is capering HUBERT comes in from the hall He stands
 watching his little niece for a minute and KATHERINE looks at
 him

HUBERT Stephen gone

KATHERINE Yesstop Olive

OLIVE Are you good at my sort of dancing Uncle

HUBERT Yes chickawfully

KATHERINE Now Olive

 The musicians have suddenly broken off in the middle of a bar
 From the street comes the noise of distant shouting

OLIVE Listen Uncle Isnt it a particular noise

 HUBERT and KATHERINE listen with all their might and OLIVE
 stares at their faces HUBERT goes to the window The sound
 comes nearer The shouted words are faintly heard Pyper
 warour force crosses frontiersharp fightinpyper

KATHERINE Breathless Yes It is

 The street cry is heard again in two distant voices coming from
 different directions Warpypersharp fightin on the
 frontierpyper

KATHERINE Shut out those ghouls

 As HUBERT closes the window NURSE WREFORD comes in from the
 hall She is an elderly woman endowed with a motherly grimness
 She fixes OLIVE with her eye then suddenly becomes conscious of
 the street cry

NURSE Oh dont say its begun

 HUBERT comes from the window

NURSE Is the regiment to go Mr Hubert

HUBERT Yes Nanny

NURSE Oh dear My boy

KATHERINE Signing to where OLIVE stands with wide eyes Nurse

HUBERT Ill look after him Nurse

NURSE And him keepin company And you not married a year Ah
Mr Hubert now do ee take care you and hims both so rash

HUBERT Not I Nurse

 NURSE looks long into his face then lifts her finger and
 beckons OLIVE

OLIVE Perceiving new sensations before her goes quietly
Goodnight Uncle Nanny dyou know why I was obliged to come down
In a fervent whisper Its a secret

 As she passes with NURSE out into the hall her voice is heard
 saying Do tell me all about the war

HUBERT Smothering emotion under a blunt manner We sail on
Friday Kit Be good to Helen old girl

KATHERINE Oh I wish Whycantwomenfight

HUBERT Yes its bad for you with Stephen taking it like this
But hell come round now its once begun

 KATHERINE shakes her head then goes suddenly up to him and
 throws her arms round his neck It is as if all the feeling
 pent up in her were finding vent in this hug

 The door from the hall is opened and SIR JOHNS voice is heard
 outside All right Ill find her

KATHERINE Father

 SIR JOHN comes in

SIR JOHN Stephen get my note I sent it over the moment I got to
the War Office

KATHERINE I expect so Seeing the torn note on the table Yes

SIR JOHN Theyre shouting the news now Thank God I stopped that
crazy speech of his in time

KATHERINE Have you stopped it

SIR JOHN What He wouldnt be such a sublime donkey

KATHERINE I think that is just what he might be Going to the
window We shall know soon

 SIR JOHN after staring at her goes up to HUBERT

SIR JOHN Keep a good heart my boy The countrys first They
exchange a handsqueeze

 KATHERINE backs away from the window STEEL has appeared there
 from the terrace breathless from running

STEEL Mr More back

KATHERINE No Has he spoken

STEEL Yes

KATHERINE Against

STEEL Yes

SIR JOHN What After

 SIR JOHN stands rigid then turns and marches straight out into
 the hall At a sign from KATHERINE HUBERT follows him

KATHERINE Yes Mr Steel

STEEL Still breathless and agitated We were herehe slipped
away from me somehow He must have gone straight down to the House
I ran over but when I got in under the Gallery he was speaking
already They expected somethingI never heard it so still there
He gripped them from the first worddeadlyevery syllable It got
some of those fellows But all the time under the silence you could
feel asort ofofcurrent going round And then SherrattI think
it wasbegan it and you saw the anger rising in them but he kept
them downhis quietness The feeling Ive never seen anything
like it there

Then there was a whisper all over the House that fighting had begun
And the whole thing broke outregular riotas if they could have
killed him Some one tried to drag him down by the coattails but
he shook him off and went on Then he stopped dead and walked out
and the noise dropped like a stone The whole thing didnt last five
minutes It was fine Mrs More likelike lava he was the only
cool person there I wouldnt have missed it for anythingit was
grand

 MORE has appeared on the terrace behind STEEL

KATHERINE Goodnight Mr Steel

STEEL Startled OhGoodnight

 He goes out into the hall KATHERINE picks up OLIVES shoes
 and stands clasping them to her breast MORE comes in

KATHERINE Youve cleared your conscience then I didnt think
youd hurt me so

 MORE does not answer still living in the scene he has gone
 through and KATHERINE goes a little nearer to him

KATHERINE Im with the country heart and soul Stephen I warn
you

 While they stand in silence facing each other the footman
 HENRY enters from the hall

FOOTMAN These notes sir from the House of Commons

KATHERINE Taking them You can have the room directly

 The FOOTMAN goes out

MORE Open them

 KATHERINE opens one after the other and lets them fall on the
 table

MORE Well

KATHERINE What you might expect Three of your best friends Its
begun

MORE Ware Mob He gives a laugh I must write to the Chief

 KATHERINE makes an impulsive movement towards him then quietly
 goes to the bureau sits down and takes up a pen

KATHERINE Let me make the rough draft She waits Yes

MORE Dictating

July 15th

DEAR SIR CHARLES After my speech tonight embodying my most
unalterable convictions KATHERINE turns and looks up at him but he
is staring straight before him and with a little movement of despair
she goes on writing I have no alternative but to place the
resignation of my UnderSecretaryship in your hands My view my
faith in this matter may be wrongbut I am surely right to keep the
flag of my faith flying I imagine I need not enlarge on the
reasons


 THE CURTAIN FALLS





ACT II

 Before noon a few days later The open windows of the
 diningroom let in the sunlight On the table a number of
 newspapers are littered HELEN is sitting there staring
 straight before her A newspaper boy runs by outside calling out
 his wares At the sound she gets up anti goes out on to the
 terrace HUBERT enters from the hall He goes at once to the
 terrace and draws HELEN into the room

HELEN Is it truewhat theyre shouting

HUBERT Yes Worse than we thought They got our men all crumpled
up in the Passguns helpless Ghastly beginning

HELEN Oh Hubert

HUBERT My dearest girl

 HELEN puts her face up to his He kisses her Then she turns
 quickly into the bay window The door from the hall has been
 opened and the footman HENRY comes in preceding WREFORD and
 his sweetheart

Catching sight of HUBERT Beg pardon sir

HUBERT All right Henry Offhand Ah Wreford The FOOTMAN

 WREFORD and the girl standing there so awkwardly

HELEN Quietly Take care of him Wreford

HUBERT Well take care of each other wont we Wreford

sobs suddenly

 they were strange and awkward she muffling her sobs

WREFORD Dont ee go on like that Nance Ill ave to take you

 She regains control of herself as the door is opened and
 KATHERINE appears accompanied by OLIVE who regards WREFORD
 with awe and curiosity and by NURSE whose eyes are red but
 whose manner is composed

KATHERINE My brother told me so glad youve brought her

WREFORD Yeas M She feels me goin a bit

WREFORD Yeas M

 He then looks rather wretchedly at his girl as if the interview
 had not done so much for him as he had hoped She drops a
 little curtsey WREFORD salutes

OLIVE Who has taken from the bureau a packet places it in his
hand Its very nourishing

WREFORD Thank you miss

 Then nudging each other and entangled in their feelings and
 the conventions they pass out shepherded by NURSE

KATHERINE Poor things

OLIVE Then we shall have to be extra nice to him

KATHERINE If we can

OLIVE I can I feel like it

 HELEN and HUBERT have returned along the terrace Seeing
 KATHERINE and the child HELEN passes on but HUBERT comes in at
 the French window

OLIVE Catching sight of himsoftly Is Uncle Hubert going to the
front today KATHERINE nods But not grandfather

KATHERINE No dear

OLIVE Thats lucky for them isnt it

 HUBERT comes in The presence of the child give him selfcontrol

HUBERT Well old girl its goodbye To OLIVE What shall I

OLIVE Are there shops at the front I thought it was dangerous

HUBERT Not a bit

OLIVE Disillusioned Oh

KATHERINE Now darling give Uncle a good hug

 Under cover of OLIVEs hug KATHERINE repairs her courage

KATHERINE The Dad and Ill be with you all in spirit Goodbye
old boy

 They do not dare to kiss and HUBERT goes out very stiff and
 straight in the doorway passing STEEL of whom he takes no
 notice STEEL hesitates and would go away

KATHERINE Come in Mr Steel

STEEL The deputation from Toulmin ought to be here Mrs More
Its twelve

OLIVE Having made a little ball of newspaperslyly Mr Steel
catch

 She throws and STEEL catches it in silence

KATHERINE Go upstairs wont you darling

OLIVE Maynt I read in the window Mummy Then I shall see if any
soldiers pass

KATHERINE No You can go out on the terrace a little and then you
must go up

 OLIVE goes reluctantly out on to the terrace

STEEL Awful news this morning of that Pass And have you seen
these Reading from the newspaper We will have no truck with the
jargon of the degenerate who vilifies his country at such a moment
The Member for Toulmin has earned for himself the contempt of all
virile patriots He takes up a second journal There is a
certain type of public man who even at his own expense cannot
resist the itch to advertise himself We would at moments of
national crisis muzzle such persons as we muzzle dogs that we
suspect of incipient rabies Theyre in full cry after
him

KATHERINE I mind much more all the creatures who are always
flinging mud at the country making him their hero suddenly You know
whats in his mind

STEEL Oh We must get him to give up that idea of lecturing
everywhere against the war Mrs More we simply must

KATHERINE Listening The deputations come Go and fetch him
Mr Steel Hell be in his room at the House

 STEEL goes out and KATHERINE Stands at bay In a moment he
 opens the door again to usher in the deputation then retires
 The four gentlemen have entered as if conscious of grave issues
 The first and most picturesque is JAMES HOME a thin tall
 greybearded man with plentiful hair contradictious eyebrows
 and the halfshy halfbold manners alternately rude and over
 polite of one not accustomed to Society yet secretly much
 taken with himself He is dressed in rough tweeds with a red
 silk tie slung through a ring and is closely followed by MARK
 WACE a waxy roundfaced man of middleage with sleek dark
 hair traces of whisker and a smooth way of continually rubbing
 his hands together as if selling something to an esteemed
 customer He is rather stout wears dark clothes with a large
 gold chain Following him comes CHARLES SHELDER a lawyer of
 fifty with a bald eggshaped head and gold pincenez He has
 little side whiskers a leathery yellowish skin a rather kind
 but watchful and dubious face and when he speaks seems to have
 a plum in his mouth which arises from the preponderance of his
 shaven upper lip Last of the deputation comes WILLIAM BANNING
 an energeticlooking squareshouldered selfmade countryman
 between fifty and sixty with grey moustaches ruddy face and
 lively brown eyes

KATHERINE How do you do Mr Home

HOME Bowing rather extravagantly over her hand as if to show his
independence of womens influence Mrs More We hardly expected
This is an honour

WACE How do you do Maam

KATHERINE And you Mr Wace

WACE Thank you Maam well indeed

SHELDER How dyou do Mrs More

KATHERINE Very well thank you Mr Shelder

BANNING Speaking with a rather broad country accent This is but
a poor occasion Maam

KATHERINE Yes Mr Banning Do sit down gentlemen

 Seeing that they will not settle down while she is standing she
 sits at the table They gradually take their seats Each
 member of the deputation in his own way is severely hanging back
 from any mention of the subject in hand and KATHERINE as intent
 on drawing them to it

KATHERINE My husband will be here in two minutes Hes only over
at the House

SHELDER Who is of higher standing and education than the others
Charming positionthis Mrs More So near theerCentre of
Gravity um

KATHERINE I read the account of your second meeting at Toulmin

BANNING Its bad Mrs Morebad Theres no disguising it That
speech was moonsummer madnessAh it was Take a lot of explaining
away Why did you let him now Why did you Not your views Im
sure

 He looks at her but for answer she only compresses her lips

BANNING I tell you what hit mewhats hit the whole constituency
and thats his knowing we were over the frontier fighting already
when he made it

KATHERINE What difference does it make if he did know

HOME Hitting below the beltI should have thoughtyoull pardon
me

BANNING Till wars begun Mrs More youre entitled to say what
you like no doubtbut after Thats going against your country
Ah his speech was strong you knowhis speech was strong

KATHERINE He had made up his mind to speak It was just an
accident the news coming then

 A silence

BANNING Well thats true I suppose What we really want is to
make sure he wont break out again

HOME Very highminded his views of coursebut some consideration
for the common herd Youll pardon me

SHELDER Weve come with the friendliest feelings Mrs Morebut
you know it wont do this sort of thing

WACE We shall be able to smooth him down Oh surely

BANNING Wed be best perhaps not to mention about his knowing that
fighting had begun

 As he speaks MORE enters through the French windows They all
 rise

MORE Goodmorning gentlemen

 He comes down to the table but does not offer to shake hands

BANNING Well Mr More Youve made a woeful mistake sir I tell
you to your face

MORE As everybody else does Banning Sit down again please

 They gradually resume their seats and MORE sits in KATHERINEs
 chair She alone remains standing leaning against the corner of
 the bay window watching their faces

BANNING Youve seen the mornings telegrams I tell you Mr
Moreanother reverse like that and the flood will sweep you clean
away And Ill not blame it Its only flesh and blood

MORE Allow for the flesh and blood in me too please When I spoke
the other night it was not without a certain feeling here He
touches his heart

BANNING But your attitudes so suddenyoud not been going that
length when you were down with us in May

MORE Do me the justice to remember that even then I was against our
policy It cost me three weeks hard struggle to make up my mind to
that speech One comes slowly to these things Banning

SHELDER Case of conscience

MORE Such things have happened Shelder even in politics

SHELDER You see our ideals are naturally lowhow different from
yours

 MORE smiles

 KATHERINE who has drawn near her husband moves back again as
 if relieved at this gleam of geniality WACE rubs his hands

BANNING Theres one thing you forget sir We send you to
Parliament representing us but you couldnt find six men in the
whole constituency that would have bidden you to make that speech

MORE Im sorry but I cant help my convictions Banning

SHELDER What was it the prophet was without in his own country

BANNING Ah but were not funning Mr More Ive never known
feeling run so high The sentiment of both meetings was dead against
you Weve had showers of letters to headquarters Some from very
good menvery warm friends of yours

SHELDER Come now Its not too late Lets go back and tell them
you wont do it again

MORE Muzzling order

BANNING Bluntly Thats about it

MORE Give up my principles to save my Parliamentary skin Then
indeed they might call me a degenerate He touches the newspapers
on the table

 KATHERINE makes an abrupt and painful movement then remains as
 still as before leaning against the corner of the windowseat

BANNING Well Well I know But we dont ask you to take your
words backwe only want discretion in the future

MORE Conspiracy of silence And have it said that a mob of
newspapers have hounded me to it

BANNING They wont say that of you

SHELDER My dear More arent you rather dropping to our level
With your principles you ought not to care two straws what people
say

MORE But I do I cant betray the dignity and courage of public
men If popular opinion is to control the utterances of her
politicians then goodbye indeed to this country

BANNING Come now I wont say that your views werent sound enough
before the fighting began Ive never liked our policy out there
But our bloods being spilled and that makes all the difference
I dont suppose theyd want me exactly but Id be ready to go
myself Wed all of us be ready And we cant have the man that
represents us talking wild until weve licked these fellows Thats
it in a nutshell

MORE I understand your feeling Banning I tender you my
resignation I cant and wont hold on where Im not wanted

BANNING No no no Dont do that His accent broader and
broader Youve ad your say and there it is Coom now Youve
been our Member nine years in rain and shine

SHELDER We want to keep you More Come Give us your promise
thats a good man

MORE I dont make cheap promises You ask too much

 There is silence and they all look at MORE

SHELDER There are very excellent reasons for the Governments
policy

MORE There are always excellent reasons for having your way with
the weak

SHELDER My dear More how can you get up any enthusiasm for those
cattlelifting ruffians

MORE Better lift cattle than lift freedom

SHELDER Well all well ask is that you shouldnt go about the
country saying so

MORE But that is just what I must do

 Again they all look at MORE in consternation

HOME Not down our way youll pardon me

WACE Reallyreally sir

SHELDER The time of crusades is past More

MORE Is it

BANNING Ah no but we dont want to part with you Mr More
Its a bitter thing this after three elections Look at the uman
side of it To speak ill of your country when theres been a
disaster like this terrible business in the Pass Theres your own
wife I see her brothers regiments to start this very afternoon
Come nowhow must she feel

 MORE breaks away to the bay window The DEPUTATION exchange
 glances

MORE Turning To try to muzzle me like thisis going too far

BANNING We just want to put you out of temptation

MORE Ive held my seat with you in all weathers for nine years
Youve all been bricks to me My hearts in my work Banning Im
not eager to undergo political eclipse at forty

SHELDER Just sowe dont want to see you in that quandary

BANNING Itd be no friendliness to give you a wrong impression of
the state of feeling Silencetill the bitterness is overpast
theres naught else for it Mr More while you feel as you do That
tongue of yours Come You owe us something Youre a big man
its the big view you ought to take

MORE I am trying to

HOME And what precisely is your viewyoull pardon my asking

MORE Turning on him Mr Home a great country such as oursis
trustee for the highest sentiments of mankind Do these few outrages
justify us in stealing the freedom of this little people

BANNING Stealtheir freedom Thats rather running before the
hounds

MORE Ah Banning now we come to it In your hearts youre none of
you for thatneither by force nor fraud And yet you all know that
weve gone in there to stay as weve gone into other landsas all
we big Powers go into other lands when theyre little and weak The
Prime Ministers words the other night were these If we are forced
to spend this blood and money now we must never again be forced
What does that mean but swallowing this country

SHELDER Well and quite frankly itd be no bad thing

HOME We dont want their wretched countrywere forced

MORE We are not forced

SHELDER My dear More what is civilization but the logical
inevitable swallowing up of the lower by the higher types of man
And what else will it be here

MORE We shall not agree there Shelder and we might argue it all
day But the point is not whether you or I are rightthe point is
What is a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do Please
tell me

 There is a silence

BANNING Simply I was just thinkin of those poor fellows in the
Pass

MORE I can see them as well as you Banning But imagine Up in
our own countrythe Black Valleytwelve hundred foreign devils dead
and dyingthe crows busy over themin our own country our own
valleyoursoursviolated Would you care about the poor
fellows in that PassInvading stealing dogs Kill themkill
them You would and I would too

 The passion of those words touches and grips as no arguments
 could and they are silent

MORE Well Whats the difference out there Im not so inhuman as
not to want to see this disaster in the Pass wiped out But once
thats done in spite of my affection for you my ambitions and
theyre not few Very low in spite of my own wifes feeling I
must be free to raise my voice against this war

BANNING Speaking slowly consulting the others as it were with
his eyes Mr More theres no man I respect more than yourself I
cant tell what theyll say down there when we go back but I for
one dont feel it in me to take a hand in pressing you farther
against your faith

SHELDER We dont deny thatthat you have a case of sorts

WACE Nosurely

SHELDER Aman should be free I suppose to hold his own opinions

MORE Thank you Shelder

BANNING Well well We must take you as you are but its a rare
pity therell be a lot of trouble

 His eyes light on Honk who is leaning forward with hand raised
 to his ear listening Very faint from far in the distance
 there is heard a skirling sound All become conscious of it
 all listen

HOME Suddenly Bagpipes

 The figure of OLIVE flies past the window out on the terrace
 KATHERINE turns as if to follow her

SHELDER Highlanders

 He rises KATHERINE goes quickly out on to the terrace One
 by one they all follow to the window One by one go out on to
 the terrace till MORE is left alone He turns to the bay
 window The music is swelling coming nearer MORE leaves the
 windowhis face distorted by the strafe of his emotions He
 paces the room taking in some sort the rhythm of the march

 Slowly the music dies away in the distance to a drumtap and the
 tramp of a company MORE stops at the table covering his eyes
 with his hands

 The DEPUTATION troop back across the terrace and come in at the
 French windows Their faces and manners have quite changed
 KATHERINE follows them as far as the window

HOME In a strange almost threatening voice It wont do Mr
More Give us your word to hold your peace

SHELDER Come More

WACE Yes indeedindeed

BANNING We must have it

MORE Without lifting his head II

 The drumtap of a regiment marching is heard

BANNING Can you hear that go by manwhen your countrys just been
struck

 Now comes the scale and mutter of a following crowd

MORE I give you

 Then sharp and clear above all other sounds the words Give
 the beggars hell boys Wipe your feet on their dirty
 country Dont leave em a gory acre And a burst of hoarse
 cheering

MORE Flinging up his head Thats reality By Heaven No

KATHERINE Oh

SHELDER In that case well go

BANNING You mean it You lose us then

 MORE bows

HOME Good riddance Venomouslyhis eyes darting between MORE and
KATHERINE Go and stump the country Find out what they think of
you Youll pardon me

 One by one without a word only BANNING looking back they pass
 out into the hall MORE sits down at the table before the pile
 of newspapers KATHERINE in the window never moves OLIVE
 comes along the terrace to her mother

OLIVE They were nice ones Such a lot of dirty people following
and some quite clean Mummy Conscious from her mothers face that
something is very wrong she looks at her father and then steals up
to his side Uncle Huberts gone Daddy and Auntie Helens crying
Andlook at Mummy

 MORE raises his head and looks

OLIVE Do be on our side Do

 She rubs her cheek against his Feeling that he does not rub
 his cheek against hers OLIVE stands away and looks from him to
 her mother in wonder


 THE CURTAIN FALLS





ACT III

SCENE I

 A cobblestoned alley without pavement behind a suburban
 theatre The tall blind dingyyellowish wall of the building
 is plastered with the tattered remnants of old entertainment
 bills and the words To Let and with several torn and one
 still virgin placard containing this announcement Stopthe
 War Meeting October 1st Addresses by STEPHEN MORE Esq and
 others The alley is plentifully strewn with refuse and scraps
 of paper Three stone steps inset lead to the stage door It
 is a dark night and a street lamp close to the wall throws all
 the light there is A faint confused murmur as of distant
 hooting is heard Suddenly a boy comes running then two rough
 girls hurry past in the direction of the sound and the alley is
 again deserted The stage door opens and a doorkeeper poking
 his head out looks up and down He withdraws but in a second
 reappears preceding three blackcoated gentlemen

DOORKEEPER Its all clear You can get away down here gentlemen
Keep to the left then sharp to the right round the corner

THE THREE Dusting themselves and settling their ties Thanks

 MORE stands hesitating on the steps then turns as if to go
 back

STEEL Come along sir come

MORE It sticks in my gizzard Steel

STEEL Running his arm through MORES and almost dragging him down
the steps You owe it to the theatre people MORE still hesitates
We might be penned in there another hour you told Mrs More

MORE All right dont dislocate my arm

 They move down the steps and away to the left as a boy comes
 running down the alley Sighting MORE he stops dead spins
 round and crying shrilly Ere e is Thats im Ere e
 is he bolts back in the direction whence he came

STEEL Quick Sir quick

MORE That is the end of the limit as the foreign ambassador
remarked

STEEL Pulling him back towards the door Well come inside again
anyway

 A number of men and boys and a few young girls are trooping
 quickly from the left A motley crew out for excitement
 loafers artisans navvies girls rough or dubious All in
 the mood of hunters and having tasted blood They gather round
 the steps displaying the momentary irresolution and curiosity
 that follows on a new development of any chase MORE on the
 bottom step turns and eyes them

A GIRL At the edge Which is im The old un or the young

 MORE turns and mounts the remaining steps

TALL YOUTH With lank black hair under a bowler hat You blasted
traitor

 MORE faces round at the volley of jeering that follows the
 chorus of booing swells then gradually dies as if they
 realized that they were spoiling their own sport

A ROUGH GIRL Dont frighten the poor feller

 A girl beside her utters a shrill laugh

STEEL Tugging at MOREs arm Come along sir

MORE Shaking his arm freeto the crowd Well what do you want

A VOICE Speech

 silence

MORE Go home and think If foreigners invaded us wouldnt you be
fighting tooth and nail like those tribesmen out there

TALL YOUTH Treacherous dogs Why dont they come out in the open

MORE They fight the best way they can

 A burst of hooting is led by a soldier in khaki on the
 outskirt

MORE My friend there in khaki led that hooting Ive never said a
word against our soldiers Its the Government I condemn for putting
them to this and the Press for hounding on the Government and all
of you for being led by the nose to do what none of you would do
left to yourselves

 The TALL YOUTH leads a somewhat unspontaneous burst of
 execration

MORE I say not one of you would go for a weaker man

VOICES IN THE CROWD

 ROUGH VOICE Tork sense

ROUGH Shut it or well do you in

MORE Recovering his coolness Ah Do me in by all means Youd
deal such a blow at cowardly mobs as wouldnt be forgotten in your
time

STEEL For Gods sake sir

MORE Shaking off his touch Well

 There is an ugly rush checked by the fall of the foremost
 figures thrown too suddenly against the bottom step The crowd
 recoils

 There is a momentary lull and MORE stares steadily down at
 them

COCKNEY VOICE Dont e speak well What eloquence

 Two or three nutshells and a piece of orangepeel strike MORE
 across the face He takes no notice

ROUGH VOICE Thats it Give im some encouragement

 The jeering laughter is changed to anger by the contemptuous
 smile on MORES face

A TALL YOUTH Traitor

A VOICE Dont stand there like a stuck pig

A ROUGH Lets ave im dahn off that

 Under cover of the applause that greets this he strikes MORE
 across the legs with a belt STEEL starts forward MORE
 flinging out his arm turns him back and resumes his tranquil
 staring at the crowd in whom the sense of being foiled by this
 silence is fast turning to rage

THE CROWD Speak up or get down Get off Get away thereor
well make you Go on

 MORE remains immovable

A YOUTH In a lull of disconcertion Ill make im speak See

 He darts forward and spits defiling MORES hand MORE jerks it
 up as if it had been stung then stands as still as ever A
 spurt of laughter dies into a shiver of repugnance at the
 action The shame is fanned again to fury by the sight of MORES
 scornful face

TALL YOUTH Out of murmuring Shift or youll get it

A VOICE Enough of your ugly mug

A ROUGH Give im one

 Two flung stones strike MORE He staggers and nearly falls
 then rights himself

A GIRLS VOICE Shame

FRIENDLY VOICE Bravo More Stick to it

A ROUGH Give im another

A VOICE No

A GIRLS VOICE Let im alone Come on Billy this aint no fun

 Still looking up at MORE the whole crowd falls into an uneasy
 silence broken only by the shuffling of feet Then the BIG
 NAVVY in the front rank turns and elbows his way out to the edge
 of the crowd

THE NAVVY Let im be

 With halfsullen and halfshamefaced acquiescence the crowd
 breaks up and drifts back whence it came till the alley is
 nearly empty

MORE As if coming to out of a trancewiping his hand and dusting
his coat Well Steel

 And followed by STEEL he descends the steps and moves away
 Two policemen pass glancing up at the broken glass One of them
 stops and makes a note


 THE CURTAIN FALLS



SCENE II

The windowend of KATHERINES bedroom panelled in creamcoloured
wood The light from four candles is falling on KATHERINE who is
sitting before the silver mirror of an old oak dressingtable
brushing her hair A door on the left stands ajar An oak chair
against the wall close to a recessed window is all the other
furniture Through this window the blue night is seen where a mist
is rolled out flat amongst trees so that only dark clumps of boughs
show here and there beneath a moonlit sky As the curtain rises
KATHERINE with brush arrested is listening She begins again
brushing her hair then stops and taking a packet of letters from a
drawer of her dressingtable reads Through the just open door
behind her comes the voice of OLIVE

OLIVE Mummy Im awake

 But KATHERINE goes on reading and OLIVE steals into the room in
 her nightgown

OLIVE At KATHERINES elbowexamining her watch on its stand Its
fourteen minutes to eleven

KATHERINE Olive Olive

OLIVE I just wanted to see the time I never can go to sleep if I

KATHERINE Talking to the wind is an expression Olive

OLIVE Does Daddy often

KATHERINE Yes nowadays

OLIVE What does it mean

KATHERINE Speaking to people who wont listen

OLIVE What do they do then

KATHERINE Just a few people go to hear him and then a great crowd
comes and breaks in or they wait for him outside and throw things
and hoot

OLIVE Poor Daddy Is it people on our side who throw things

KATHERINE Yes but only rough people

OLIVE Why does he go on doing it I shouldnt

KATHERINE He thinks it is his duty

OLIVE To your neighbour or only to God

KATHERINE To both

Daddy

 KATHERINE comes back She is about to leave the door a little
 open when she hears a knock on the other door It is opened a
 few inches and NURSES voice says Can I come in Maam The
 NURSE comes in

KATHERINE Shutting OLIVEs door and going up to her What is it
Nurse

NURSE Speaking in a low voice Ive been meaning toIll never do

vengeance

NURSE Ive had another letter from my son No Miss Katherine

 She nods her head gravely goes to the door of OLIVES room
 opens it gently stands looking for amoment then with the
 words My Lamb she goes in noiselessly and closes the door

 KATHERINE turns back to her glass puts back her hair and
 smooths her lips and eyes The door from the corridor is
 opened and HELENs voice says Kit Youre not in bed

KATHERINE No

 HELEN too is in a wrapper with a piece of lace thrown over her
 head Her face is scared and miserable and she runs into
 KATHERINEs arms

KATHERINE My dear what is it

HELEN Ive seena vision

KATHERINE Hssh Youll wake Olive

HELEN Staring before her Id just fallen asleep and I saw a
plain that seemed to run into the skylikethat fog And on it
there weredark things One grew into a body without a head and a
gun by its side And one was a man sitting huddled up nursing a
wounded leg He had the face of Huberts servant Wreford And then
I sawHubert His face was all dark and thin and he hada wound
an awful wound here She touches her breast The blood was running
from it and he kept trying to stop itoh Kitby kissing it She
pauses stifled by emotion Then I heard Wreford laugh and say
vultures didnt touch live bodies And there came a voice from
somewhere calling out Oh God Im dying And Wreford began to
swear at it and I heard Hubert say Dont Wreford let the poor
fellow be But the voice went on and on moaning and crying out
Ill lie here all night dyingand then Ill die And Wreford
dragged himself along the ground his face all devilish like a man
whos going to kill

KATHERINE My dear HOW ghastly

HELEN Still that voice went on and I saw Wreford take up the dead
mans gun Then Hubert got upon his feet and went tottering along
so feebly so dreadfullybut before he could reach and stop him
Wreford fired at the man who was crying And Hubert called out You
brute and fell right down And when Wreford saw him lying there
he began to moan and sob but Hubert never stirred Then it all got
black againand I could see a dark womanthing creeping first to
the man without a head then to Wreford then to Hubert and it
touched him and sprang away And it cried out Aaiah Pointing
out at the mist Look Out there The dark things

KATHERINE Putting her arms round her Yes dear yes You must
have been looking at the mist

HELEN Strangely calm Hes dead

KATHERINE It was only a dream

HELEN You didnt hear that cry She listens Thats Stephen
Forgive me Kit I oughtnt to have upset you but I couldnt help
coming

 She goes out KATHERINE into whom her emotion seems to have
 passed turns feverishly to the window throws it open and leans
 out MORE comes in

MORE Kit

 Catching sight of her figure in the window he goes quickly to
 her

KATHERINE Ah She has mastered her emotion

MORE Let me look at you

 He draws her from the window to the candlelight and looks long
 at her

MORE What have you done to your hair

KATHERINE Nothing

MORE Its wonderful tonight

 He takes it greedily and buries his face in it

KATHERINE Drawing her hair away Well

MORE At last

KATHERINE Pointing to OLIVEs room Hssh

travellers feel when they come out of the desert towater

KATHERINE Suddenly noticing the cut on his forehead Your
forehead Its cut

MORE Its nothing

KATHERINE Oh Let me bathe it

MORE Poor child

KATHERINE Dream bad dreams and wait and hide oneselftheres

MORE Hide Because of me

 KATHERINE nods

MORE With a movement of distress I see I thought from your
letters you were coming to feel Kit You look so lovely

 Suddenly he sees that she is crying and goes quickly to her

MORE My dear dont cry God knows I dont want to make things
worse for you Ill go away

 She draws away from him a little and after looking long at her
 he sits down at the dressingtable and begins turning over the
 brushes and articles of toilet trying to find words

MORE Never look forward After the time Ive hadI thought
tonightit would be summerI thought it would be youand
everything

 While he is speaking KATHERINE has stolen closer She suddenly
 drops on her knees by his side and wraps his hand in her hair
 He turns and clasps her

MORE Kit

KATHERINE Ah yes Buttomorrow it begins again Oh Stephen
How longhow long am I to be torn in two Drawing back in his
arms I cantcant bear it

MORE Youof all peopleyou

KATHERINE Stephen

 For a moment MORE yields utterly then shrinks back

MORE A bargain Its selling my soul

 He struggles out of her arms gets up and stands without
 speaking staring at her and wiping the sweat from his
 forehead KATHERINE remains some seconds on her knees gazing
 up at him not realizing Then her head droops she too gets up
 and stands apart with her wrapper drawn close round her It is
 as if a cold and deadly shame had come to them both Quite
 suddenly MORE turns and without looking back feebly makes his
 way out of the room When he is gone KATHERINE drops on her
 knees and remains there motionless huddled in her hair

still draws back he says more sharply Give them to me Steel
STEEL hands them over Now that ends it dyou see

 They stand looking at each other then STEEL very much upset
 turns and goes out of the room MORE who has watched him with
 a sorry smile puts the papers into a dispatchcase As he is
 closing the bureau the footman HENRY enters announcing Mr
 Mendip sir MENDIP comes in and the FOOTMAN withdraws MORE
 turns to his visitor but does not hold out his hand

MENDIP Taking MORES hand Give me credit for a little philosophy
my friend Mrs More told me youd be back today Have you heard

MORE What

MENDIP Theres been a victory

MORE Thank God

MENDIP Ah So you actually are flesh and blood

MORE Yes

MENDIP Take off the martyrs shirt Stephen Youre only flouting
human nature

MORE Soeven you defend the mob

MENDIP My dear fellow youre up against the strongest common
instinct in the world What do you expect That the man in the
street should be a Quixote That his love of country should express
itself in philosophic altruism What on earth do you expect Men
are very simple creatures and Mob is just conglomerate essence of
simple men

MORE Conglomerate excrescence Mud of street and marketplace
gathered in a torrentThis blind howling patriotismwhat each man
feels in here He touches his breast No

MENDIP You think men go beyond instinctthey dont All they know
is that somethings hurting that image of themselves that they call
country They just feel something big and religious and go it
blind

MORE This used to be the country of free speech It used to be the
country where a man was expected to hold to his faith

MENDIP There are limits to human nature Stephen

MORE Let no man stand to his guns in face of popular attack Still
your advice is it

MENDIP My advice is Get out of town at once The torrent you
speak of will be let loose the moment this news is out Come my
dear fellow dont stay here

MORE Thanks Ill see that Katherine and Olive go

MENDIP Go with them If your cause is lost thats no reason why
you should be

MORE Theres the comfort of not running away AndI want comfort

MENDIP This is bad Stephen bad foolishfoolish Well Im
going to the House This way

MORE Down the steps and through the gate Goodbye

 KATHERINE has come in followed by NURSE hatted and cloaked
 with a small bag in her hand KATHERINE takes from the bureau a
 cheque which she hands to the NURSE MORE comes in from the
 terrace

MORE Youre wise to go Nurse

NURSE Youve treated my poor dear badly sir Wheres your heart

MORE In full use

NURSE On those heathens Dont your own hearth and home come
first Your wife that was born in time of war with her own father
fighting and her grandfather killed for his country A bitter
thing to have the windows of her house broken and be pointed at by
the boys in the street

 MORE stands silent under this attack looking at his wife

KATHERINE Nurse

NURSE Its unnatural sirwhat youre doing To think more of
those savages than of your own wife Look at her Did you ever see
her look like that Take care sir before its too late

MORE Enough please

 NURSE stands for a moment doubtful looks long at KATHERINE
 then goes

MORE Quietly There has been a victory

 He goes out KATHERINE is breathing fast listening to the
 distant hum and stir rising in the street She runs to the
 window as the footman HENRY entering says Sir John Julian
 Maam SIR JOHN comes in a newspaper in his hand

KATHERINE At last A victory

SIR JOHN Thank God He hands her the paper

KATHERINE Oh Dad

 She tears the paper open and feverishly reads

KATHERINE At last

 The distant hum in the street is rising steadily But SIR JOHN
 after the one exultant moment when he handed her the paper
 stares dumbly at the floor

KATHERINE Suddenly conscious of his gravity Father

SIR JOHN There is other news

KATHERINE One of the boys Hubert

 SIR JOHN bows his head

KATHERINE Killed

 SIR JOHN again bows his head

KATHERINE The dream She covers her face Poor Helen

 They stand for a few seconds silent then SIR JOHN raises his
 head and putting up a hand touches her wet cheek

SIR JOHN Huskily Whom the gods love

KATHERINE Hubert

SIR JOHN And hulks like me go on living

KATHERINE Dear Dad

SIR JOHN But we shall drive the ruffians now We shall break them
Stephen back

KATHERINE Last night

SIR JOHN Has he finished his blasphemous speechmaking at last
KATHERINE shakes her head Not

 Then seeing that KATHERINE is quivering with emotion he
 strokes her hand

SIR JOHN My dear Death is in many houses

KATHERINE I must go to Helen Tell Stephen Father I cant

SIR JOHN If you wish child

 She goes out leaving SIR JOHN to his grave puzzled grief and
 in a few seconds MORE comes in

MORE Yes Sir John You wanted me

SIR JOHN Hubert is killed

MORE Hubert

SIR JOHN By thesewhom you uphold Katherine asked me to let you
know Shes gone to Helen I understand you only came back last
night from yourNo word I can use would give what I feel about
that I dont know how things stand now between you and Katherine
but I tell you this Stephen youve tried her these last two months
beyond what any woman ought to bear

 MORE makes a gesture of pain

SIR JOHN When you chose your course

MORE Chose

SIR JOHN You placed yourself in opposition to every feeling in her
You knew this might come It may come again with another of my sons

MORE I would willingly change places with any one of them

SIR JOHN YesI can believe in your unhappiness I cannot conceive
of greater misery than to be arrayed against your country If I
could have Hubert back I would not have him at such a priceno nor
all my sons Pro patri moriMy boy at all events is happy

MORE Yes

SIR JOHN Yet you can go on doing what you are What devil of pride
has got into you Stephen

MORE Do you imagine I think myself better than the humblest private
fighting out there Not for a minute

SIR JOHN I dont understand you I always thought you devoted to
Katherine

MORE Sir John you believe that country comes before wife and
child

SIR JOHN I do

MORE So do I

SIR JOHN Bewildered Whatever my country does or leaves undone I
no more presume to judge her than I presume to judge my God With
all the exaltation of the suffering he has undergone for her My
country

MORE I would give all I havefor that creed

SIR JOHN Puzzled Stephen Ive never looked on you as a crank
I always believed you sane and honest But this isvisionary mania

MORE Vision of what might be

SIR JOHN Why cant you be content with what the grandest nation
the grandest men on earthhave found good enough for them Ive
known them Ive seen what they could suffer for our country

MORE Sir John imagine what the last two months have been to me
To see people turn away in the streetold friends pass me as if I
were a wall To dread the post To go to bed every night with the
sound of hooting in my ears To know that my name is never referred
to without contempt

SIR JOHN You have your new friends Plenty of them I understand

MORE Does that make up for being spat at as I was last night Your
battles are fools play to it

 The stir and rustle of the crowd in the street grows louder
 SIR JOHN turns his head towards it

SIR JOHN Youve heard theres been a victory Do you carry your
unnatural feeling so far as to be sorry for that MORE shakes his
head Thats something For Gods sake Stephen stop before its
gone past mending Dont ruin your life with Katherine Hubert was
her favourite brother you are backing those who killed him Think
what that means to her Drop thismad Quixotismidealismwhatever
you call it Take Katherine away Leave the country till the
things overthis country of yours that youre opposing andand
traducing Take her away Come What good are you doing What
earthly good Come my boy Before youre utterly undone

MORE Sir John Our men are dying out there for the faith thats
in them I believe my faith the higher the better for mankindAm
I to slink away Since I began this campaign Ive found hundreds
whove thanked me for taking this stand They look on me now as
their leader Am I to desert them When you led your forlorn hope
did you ask yourself what good you were doing or whether youd come
through alive Its my forlorn hope not to betray those who are
following me and not to help let die a firea fire thats sacred
not only now in this country but in all countries for all time

SIR JOHN After a long stare I give you credit for believing what
you say But let me tell you whatever that fire you talk ofIm too
oldfashioned to graspone fire you are letting dieyour wifes
love By God This crew of your new friends this crew of cranks
and jays if they can make up to you for the loss of her loveof
your career of all those who used to like and respect youso much
the better for you But if you find yourself bankrupt of affection
alone as the last man on earth if this business ends in your utter
ruin and destructionas it mustI shall not pityI cannot pity
you Goodnight

 He marches to the door opens it and goes out MORE is left
 standing perfectly still The stir and murmur of the street is
 growing all the time and slowly forces itself on his
 consciousness He goes to the bay window and looks out then
 rings the bell It is not answered and after turning up the
 lights he rings again KATHERINE comes in She is wearing a
 black hat and black outdoor coat She speaks coldly without
 looking up

KATHERINE You rang

MORE For them to shut this room up

KATHERINE The servants have gone out Theyre afraid of the house
being set on fire

KATHERINE Last night you used the wordbargain Quite right I

Stephen

MORE God knowsI never meant

 MORE as if lashed by a whip has thrown up his hands in an
 attitude of defence

KATHERINE Yes thats cruel It shows the heights you live on I

free to go and to take her

KATHERINE Very low Thank you Suddenly she turns to him and
draws his eyes on her Without a sound she puts her whole strength
into that look Stephen Give it up Come down to me

 The festive sounds from the street grow louder There can be
 heard the blowing of whistles and bladders and all the sounds
 of joy

MORE And drown inthat

KATHERINE turns swiftly to the door There she stands and again
looks at him Her face is mysterious from the conflicting currents
of her emotions

MORE Soyoure going

KATHERINE In a whisper Yes

 She bends her head opens the door and goes MORE starts
 forward as if to follow her but OLIVE has appeared in the
 doorway She has on a straight little white coat and a round
 white cap

OLIVE Arent you coming with us Daddy

 MORE shakes his head

OLIVE Why not

MORE Never mind my dicky bird

OLIVE The motorll have to go very slow There are such a lot of

OLIVE Oh love me up Daddy

 MORE takes and loves her up

OLIVE Ooo

MORE Trot my soul

 She goes looks back at him turns suddenly and vanishes

 MORE follows her to the door but stops there Then as full
 realization begins to dawn on him he runs to the bay window
 craning his head to catch sight of the front door There is the
 sound of a vehicle starting and the continual hooting of its
 horn as it makes its way among the crowd He turns from the
 window

MORE Alone as the last man on earth

 Suddenly a voice rises clear out of the hurlyburly in the
 street

VOICE There e is Thats im More Traitor More

 A shower of nutshells orangepeel and harmless missiles begins
 to rattle against the glass of the window Many voices take up
 the groaning More Traitor Blackleg More And through
 the window can be seen waving flags and lighted Chinese
 lanterns swinging high on long bamboos The din of execration
 swells MORE stands unheeding still gazing after the cab
 Then with a sharp crack a flung stone crashes through one of
 the panes It is followed by a hoarse shout of laughter and a
 hearty groan A second stone crashes through the glass MORE
 turns for a moment with a contemptuous look towards the
 street and the flare of the Chinese lanterns lights up his
 face Then as if forgetting all about the din outside he
 moves back into the room looks round him and lets his head
 droop The din rises louder and louder a third stone crashes
 through MORE raises his head again and clasping his hands
 looks straight before him The footman HENRY entering
 hastens to the French windows

MORE Ah Henry I thought youd gone

FOOTMAN I came back sir

MORE Good fellow

FOOTMAN Theyre trying to force the terrace gate sir Theyve no
business coming on to private propertyno matter what

 In the surging entrance of the mob the footman HENRY who shows
 fight is overwhelmed hustled out into the crowd on the
 terrace and no more seen The MOB is a mixed crowd of
 revellers of both sexes medical students clerks shop men and
 girls and a Boy Scout or two Many have exchanged hatsSome
 wear masks or false noses some carry feathers or tin whistles
 Some with bamboos and Chinese lanterns swing them up outside
 on the terrace The medley of noises is very great Such
 ringleaders as exist in the confusion are a GROUP OF STUDENTS
 the chief of whom conspicuous because unadorned is an
 athletic hatless young man with a projecting underjaw and
 heavy coalblack moustache who seems with the swing of his huge
 arms and shoulders to sway the currents of motion When the
 first surge of noise and movement subsides he calls out To
 him boys Chair the hero THE STUDENTS rush at the impassive
 MORE swing him roughly on to their shoulders and bear him round
 the room When they have twice circled the table to the music
 of their confused singing groans and whistling THE CHIEF OF
 THE STUDENTS calls out Put him down Obediently they set him
 down on the table which has been forced into the bay window and
 stand gaping up at him

CHIEF STUDENT Speech Speech

 The noise ebbs and MORE looks round him

CHIEF STUDENT Now then you sir

MORE In a quiet voice Very well You are here by the law that
governs the action of all mobsthe law of Force By that law you
can do what you like to this body of mine

A VOICE And we will too

MORE I dont doubt it But before that Ive a word to say

A VOICE Youve always that

 ANOTHER VOICE raises a donkeys braying

MORE YouMobare the most contemptible thing under the sun When
you walk the streetGod goes in

CHIEF STUDENT Be careful yousir

VOICES Down him Down with the beggar

MORE Above the murmurs My fine friends Im not afraid of you
Youve forced your way into my house and youve asked me to speak
Put up with the truth for once His words rush out You are the
thing that pelts the weak kicks women howls down free speech This
today and that tomorrow Brainyou have none Spiritnot the
ghost of it If youre not meanness theres no such thing If
youre not cowardice there is no cowardice Above the growing
fierceness of the hubbub Patriotismthere are two kindsthat of
our soldiers and this of mine You have neither

CHIEF STUDENT Checking a dangerous rush Hold on Hold on To
MORE Swear to utter no more blasphemy against your country Swear
it

CROWD Ah Ay Ah

MORE My country is not yours Mine is that great country which
shall never take toll from the weakness of others Above the
groaning Ah you can break my head and my windows but dont think
that you can break my faith You could never break or shake it if
you were a million to one

 A girl with dark eyes and hair all wild leaps out from the
 crowd and shakes her fist at him

GIRL Youre friends with them that killed my lad MORE smiles
down at her and she swiftly plucks the knife from the belt of a Boy
Scout beside her Smile youcur

 A violent rush and heave from behind flings MORE forward on to
 the steel He reels staggers back and falls down amongst the
 crowd A scream a sway a rush a hubbub of cries The CHIEF
 STUDENT shouts above the riot Steady Another My God
 Hes got it

CHIEF STUDENT Give him air

 The crowd falls back and two STUDENTS bending over MORE lift
 his arms and head but they fall like lead Desperately they
 test him for life

CHIEF STUDENT By the Lord its over

 Then begins a scared swaying out towards the window Some one
 turns out the lights and in the darkness the crowd fast melts
 away The body of MORE lies in the gleam from a single Chinese
 lantern Muttering the words Poor devil He kept his end up
 anyway the CHIEF STUDENT picks from the floor a little
 abandoned Union Jack and lays it on MOREs breast Then he
 too turns and rushes out

 And the body of MORE lies in the streak of light and flee
 noises in the street continue to rise


 THE CURTAIN FALLS BUT RISES AGAIN ALMOST AT ONCE




AFTERMATH

 A late Spring dawn is just breaking Against trees in leaf and
 blossom with the houses of a London Square beyond suffused by
 the spreading glow is seen a dark lifesize statue on a granite
 pedestal In front is the broad dustdim pavement The light
 grows till the central words around the pedestal can be clearly
 read

 ERECTED
 To the Memory
 of
 STEPHEN MORE
 Faithful to his ideal

High above the face of MORE looks straight before him with a faint
smile On one shoulder and on his bare head two sparrows have
perched and from the gardens behind comes the twittering and
singing of birds


THE CURTAIN FALLS

 Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
 1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit httppglaforg

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate

 International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks online payments and credit card
 donations To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


 Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
 works

 Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


 Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
 unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
