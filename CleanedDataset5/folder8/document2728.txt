HUNTER QUATERMAINS STORY

by H Rider Haggard


Sir Henry Curtis as everybody acquainted with him knows is one of the
most hospitable men on earth It was in the course of the enjoyment of
his hospitality at his place in Yorkshire the other day that I heard the
hunting story which I am now about to transcribe Many of those who read
it will no doubt have heard some of the strange rumours that are flying
about to the effect that Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good
RN recently found a vast treasure of diamonds out in the heart of
Africa supposed to have been hidden by the Egyptians or King Solomon
or some other antique people I first saw the matter alluded to in a
paragraph in one of the society papers the day before I started for
Yorkshire to pay my visit to Curtis and arrived needless to say
burning with curiosity for there is something very fascinating to the
mind in the idea of hidden treasure When I reached the Hall I at once
asked Curtis about it and he did not deny the truth of the story but
on my pressing him to tell it he would not nor would Captain Good who
was also staying in the house

You would not believe me if I did Sir Henry said with one of the
hearty laughs which seem to come right out of his great lungs You
must wait till Hunter Quatermain comes he will arrive here from Africa
tonight and I am not going to say a word about the matter or Good
either until he turns up Quatermain was with us all through he has
known about the business for years and years and if it had not been
for him we should not have been here today I am going to meet him
presently

I could not get a word more out of him nor could anybody else though
we were all dying of curiosity especially some of the ladies I shall
never forget how they looked in the drawingroom before dinner when
Captain Good produced a great rough diamond weighing fifty carats or
more and told them that he had many larger than that If ever I saw
curiosity and envy printed on fair faces I saw them then

It was just at this moment that the door was opened and Mr Allan
Quatermain announced whereupon Good put the diamond into his pocket
and sprang at a little man who limped shyly into the room convoyed by
Sir Henry Curtis himself

Here he is Good safe and sound said Sir Henry gleefully Ladies
and gentlemen let me introduce you to one of the oldest hunters and the
very best shot in Africa who has killed more elephants and lions than
any other man alive

Everybody turned and stared politely at the curiouslooking little lame
man and though his size was insignificant he was quite worth staring
at He had short grizzled hair which stood about an inch above his head
like the bristles of a brush gentle brown eyes that seemed to notice
everything and a withered face tanned to the colour of mahogany
from exposure to the weather He spoke too when he returned Goods
enthusiastic greeting with a curious little accent which made his
speech noticeable

It so happened that I sat next to Mr Allan Quatermain at dinner and
of course did my best to draw him but he was not to be drawn He
admitted that he had recently been a long journey into the interior of
Africa with Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good and that they had found
treasure and then politely turned the subject and began to ask me
questions about England where he had never been beforethat is since
he came to years of discretion Of course I did not find this very
interesting and so cast about for some means to bring the conversation
round again

Now we were dining in an oakpanelled vestibule and on the wall
opposite to me were fixed two gigantic elephant tusks and under them
a pair of buffalo horns very rough and knotted showing that they came
off an old bull and having the tip of one horn split and chipped I
noticed that Hunter Quatermains eyes kept glancing at these trophies
and took an occasion to ask him if he knew anything about them

I ought to he answered with a little laugh the elephant to which
those tusks belonged tore one of our party right in two about eighteen
months ago and as for the buffalo horns they were nearly my death and
were the end of a servant of mine to whom I was much attached I
gave them to Sir Henry when he left Natal some months ago and Mr
Quatermain sighed and turned to answer a question from the lady whom he
had taken down to dinner and who needless to say was also employed in
trying to pump him about the diamonds

Indeed all round the table there was a simmer of scarcely suppressed
excitement which when the servants had left the room could no longer
be restrained

Now Mr Quatermain said the lady next him we have been kept in an
agony of suspense by Sir Henry and Captain Good who have persistently
refused to tell us a word of this story about the hidden treasure till
you came and we simply can bear it no longer so please begin at
once

Yes said everybody go on please

Hunter Quatermain glanced round the table apprehensively he did not
seem to appreciate finding himself the object of so much curiosity

Ladies and gentlemen he said at last with a shake of his grizzled
head I am very sorry to disappoint you but I cannot do it It is this
way At the request of Sir Henry and Captain Good I have written down a
true and plain account of King Solomons Mines and how we found them
so you will soon be able to learn all about that wonderful adventure
for yourselves but until then I will say nothing about it not from
any wish to disappoint your curiosity or to make myself important but
simply because the whole story partakes so much of the marvellous that
I am afraid to tell it in a piecemeal hasty fashion for fear I should
be set down as one of those common fellows of whom there are so many in
my profession who are not ashamed to narrate things they have not seen
and even to tell wonderful stories about wild animals they have never
killed And I think that my companions in adventure Sir Henry Curtis
and Captain Good will bear me out in what I say

Yes Quatermain I think you are quite right said Sir Henry
Precisely the same considerations have forced Good and myself to hold
our tongues We did not wish to be bracketed withwell with other
famous travellers

There was a murmur of disappointment at these announcements

I believe you are all hoaxing us said the young lady next Mr
Quatermain rather sharply

Believe me answered the old hunter with a quaint courtesy and a
little bow of his grizzled head though I have lived all my life in the
wilderness and amongst savages I have neither the heart nor the want
of manners to wish to deceive one so lovely

Whereat the young lady who was pretty looked appeased

This is very dreadful I broke in We ask for bread and you give us a
stone Mr Quatermain The least that you can do is to tell us the story
of the tusks opposite and the buffalo horns underneath We wont let you
off with less

I am but a poor storyteller put in the old hunter but if you will
forgive my want of skill I shall be happy to tell you not the story
of the tusks for that is part of the history of our journey to King
Solomons Mines but that of the buffalo horns beneath them which is
now ten years old

Bravo Quatermain said Sir Henry We shall all be delighted Fire
away Fill up your glass first

The little man did as he was bid took a sip of claret and
beganAbout ten years ago I was hunting up in the far interior of
Africa at a place called Gatgarra not a great way from the Chobe
River I had with me four native servants namely a driver and
voorlooper or leader who were natives of Matabeleland a Hottentot
named Hans who had once been the slave of a Transvaal Boer and a Zulu
hunter who for five years had accompanied me upon my trips and whose
name was Mashune Now near Gatgarra I found a fine piece of healthy
parklike country where the grass was very good considering the time
of year and here I made a little camp or headquarter settlement from
whence I went expeditions on all sides in search of game especially
elephant My luck however was bad I got but little ivory I was
therefore very glad when some natives brought me news that a large herd
of elephants were feeding in a valley about thirty miles away At first
I thought of trekking down to the valley waggon and all but gave up
the idea on hearing that it was infested with the deadly tsetse fly
which is certain death to all animals except men donkeys and wild
game So I reluctantly determined to leave the waggon in the charge of
the Matabele leader and driver and to start on a trip into the thorn
country accompanied only by the Hottentot Hans and Mashune

Accordingly on the following morning we started and on the evening of
the next day reached the spot where the elephants were reported to be
But here again we were met by ill luck That the elephants had been
there was evident enough for their spoor was plentiful and so were
other traces of their presence in the shape of mimosa trees torn out
of the ground and placed topsyturvy on their flat crowns in order to
enable the great beasts to feed on their sweet roots but the elephants
themselves were conspicuous by their absence They had elected to move
on This being so there was only one thing to do and that was to move
after them which we did and a pretty hunt they led us For a fortnight
or more we dodged about after those elephants coming up with them on
two occasions and a splendid herd they wereonly however to lose
them again At length we came up with them a third time and I managed
to shoot one bull and then they started off again where it was useless
to try and follow them After this I gave it up in disgust and we made
the best of our way back to the camp not in the sweetest of tempers
carrying the tusks of the elephant I had shot

It was on the afternoon of the fifth day of our tramp that we reached
the little koppie overlooking the spot where the waggon stood and I
confess that I climbed it with a pleasurable sense of homecoming for
his waggon is the hunters home as much as his house is that of the
civilized person I reached the top of the koppie and looked in the
direction where the friendly white tent of the waggon should be but
there was no waggon only a black burnt plain stretching away as far as
the eye could reach I rubbed my eyes looked again and made out on the
spot of the camp not my waggon but some charred beams of wood Half
wild with grief and anxiety followed by Hans and Mashune I ran at full
speed down the slope of the koppie and across the space of plain below
to the spring of water where my camp had been I was soon there only
to find that my worst suspicions were confirmed

The waggon and all its contents including my spare guns and
ammunition had been destroyed by a grass fire

Now before I started I had left orders with the driver to burn off
the grass round the camp in order to guard against accidents of this
nature and here was the reward of my folly a very proper illustration
of the necessity especially where natives are concerned of doing a
thing ones self if one wants it done at all Evidently the lazy
rascals had not burnt round the waggon most probably indeed they had
themselves carelessly fired the tall and resinous tambouki grass near
by the wind had driven the flames on to the waggon tent and there was
quickly an end of the matter As for the driver and leader I know not
what became of them probably fearing my anger they bolted taking the
oxen with them I have never seen them from that hour to this

I sat down on the black veldt by the spring and gazed at the charred
axles and disselboom of my waggon and I can assure you ladies and
gentlemen I felt inclined to weep As for Mashune and Hans they cursed
away vigorously one in Zulu and the other in Dutch Ours was a pretty
position We were nearly 300 miles away from Bamangwato the capital of
Khamas country which was the nearest spot where we could get any help
and our ammunition spare guns clothing food and everything else
were all totally destroyed I had just what I stood in which was a
flannel shirt a pair of veldtschoons or shoes of raw hide my
eightbore rifle and a few cartridges Hans and Mashune had also each
a Martini rifle and some cartridges not many And it was with this
equipment that we had to undertake a journey of 300 miles through a
desolate and almost uninhabited region I can assure you that I have
rarely been in a worse position and I have been in some queer ones
However these things are the natural incidents of a hunters life and
the only thing to do was to make the best of them

Accordingly after passing a comfortless night by the remains of
my waggon we started next morning on our long journey towards
civilization Now if I were to set to work to tell you all the troubles
and incidents of that dreadful journey I should keep you listening
here till midnight so I will with your permission pass on to the
particular adventure of which the pair of buffalo horns opposite are the
melancholy memento

We had been travelling for about a month living and getting along
as best we could when one evening we camped some forty miles from
Bamangwato By this time we were indeed in a melancholy plight
footsore half starved and utterly worn out and in addition I was
suffering from a sharp attack of fever which half blinded me and made
me weak as a babe Our ammunition too was exhausted I had only one
cartridge left for my eightbore rifle and Hans and Mashune who were
armed with Martini Henrys had three between them It was about an hour
from sundown when we halted and lit a firefor luckily we had still a
few matches It was a charming spot to camp I remember Just off the
game track we were following was a little hollow fringed about with
flatcrowned mimosa trees and at the bottom of the hollow a spring
of clear water welled up out of the earth and formed a pool round the
edges of which grew an abundance of watercresses of an exactly similar
kind to those which were handed round the table just now Now we had no
food of any kind left having that morning devoured the last remains
of a little oribe antelope which I had shot two days previously
Accordingly Hans who was a better shot than Mashune took two of the
three remaining Martini cartridges and started out to see if he could
not kill a buck for supper I was too weak to go myself

Meanwhile Mashune employed himself in dragging together some dead
boughs from the mimosa trees to make a sort of skerm or shelter for
us to sleep in about forty yards from the edge of the pool of water
We had been greatly troubled with lions in the course of our long tramp
and only on the previous night have very nearly been attacked by them
which made me nervous especially in my weak state Just as we had
finished the skerm or rather something which did duty for one Mashune
and I heard a shot apparently fired about a mile away

Hark to it sung out Mashune in Zulu more I fancy by way of
keeping his spirits up than for any other reasonfor he was a sort of
black Mark Tapley and very cheerful under difficulties Hark to the
wonderful sound with which the Maboona the Boers shook our fathers
to the ground at the Battle of the Blood River We are hungry now my
father our stomachs are small and withered up like a dried oxs paunch
but they will soon be full of good meat Hans is a Hottentot and an
umfagozan that is a low fellow but he shoots straightah he
certainly shoots straight Be of a good heart my father there will
soon be meat upon the fire and we shall rise up men

And so he went on talking nonsense till I told him to stop because he
made my head ache with his empty words

Shortly after we heard the shot the sun sank in his red splendour and
there fell upon earth and sky the great hush of the African wilderness
The lions were not up as yet they would probably wait for the moon and
the birds and beasts were all at rest I cannot describe the intensity
of the quiet of the night to me in my weak state and fretting as I was
over the nonreturn of the Hottentot Hans it seemed almost ominousas
though Nature were brooding over some tragedy which was being enacted in
her sight

It was quietquiet as death and lonely as the grave

Mashune I said at last where is Hans my heart is heavy for him

Nay my father I know not mayhap he is weary and sleeps or mayhap
he has lost his way

Mashune art thou a boy to talk folly to me I answered Tell me
in all the years thou hast hunted by my side didst thou ever know a
Hottentot to lose his path or to sleep upon the way to camp

Nay Macumazahn that ladies is my native name and means the man
who gets up by night or who is always awake I know not where he
is

But though we talked thus we neither of us liked to hint at what was
in both our minds namely that misfortunate had overtaken the poor
Hottentot

Mashune I said at last go down to the water and bring me of those
green herbs that grow there I am hungered and must eat something

Nay my father surely the ghosts are there they come out of the
water at night and sit upon the banks to dry themselves An Isanusi
told it me

  _Isanusi_ witchfinder

Mashune was I think one of the bravest men I ever knew in the
daytime but he had a more than civilized dread of the supernatural

Must I go myself thou fool I said sternly

Nay Macumazahn if thy heart yearns for strange things like a sick
woman I go even if the ghosts devour me

And accordingly he went and soon returned with a large bundle of
watercresses of which I ate greedily

Art thou not hungry I asked the great Zulu presently as he sat
eyeing me eating

Never was I hungrier my father

Then eat and I pointed to the watercresses

Nay Macumazahn I cannot eat those herbs

If thou dost not eat thou wilt starve eat Mashune

He stared at the watercresses doubtfully for a while and at last
seized a handful and crammed them into his mouth crying out as he did
so Oh why was I born that I should live to feed on green weeds like
an ox Surely if my mother could have known it she would have killed me
when I was born and so he went on lamenting between each fistful of
watercresses till all were finished when he declared that he was full
indeed of stuff but it lay very cold on his stomach like snow upon
a mountain At any other time I should have laughed for it must be
admitted he had a ludicrous way of putting things Zulus do not like
green food

Just after Mashune had finished his watercress we heard the loud
woof woof of a lion who was evidently promenading much nearer to
our little skerm than was pleasant Indeed on looking into the darkness
and listening intently I could hear his snoring breath and catch the
light of his great yellow eyes We shouted loudly and Mashune threw
some sticks on the fire to frighten him which apparently had the
desired effect for we saw no more of him for a while

Just after we had had this fright from the lion the moon rose in her
fullest splendour throwing a robe of silver light over all the earth
I have rarely seen a more beautiful moonrise I remember that sitting in
the skerm I could with ease read faint pencil notes in my pocketbook
As soon as the moon was up game began to trek down to the water just
below us I could from where I sat see all sorts of them passing
along a little ridge that ran to our right on their way to the drinking
place Indeed one bucka large elandcame within twenty yards of the
skerm and stood at gaze staring at it suspiciously his beautiful
head and twisted horns standing out clearly against the sky I had I
recollect every mind to have a pull at him on the chance of providing
ourselves with a good supply of beef but remembering that we had but
two cartridges left and the extreme uncertainty of a shot by moonlight
I at length decided to refrain The eland presently moved on to the
water and a minute or two afterwards there arose a great sound of
splashing followed by the quick fall of galloping hoofs

Whats that Mashune I asked

That dam lion buck smell him replied the Zulu in English of which
he had a very superficial knowledge

Scarcely were the words out of his mouth before we heard a sort of
whine over the other side of the pool which was instantly answered by a
loud coughing roar close to us

By Jove I said there are two of them They have lost the buck we
must look out they dont catch us And again we made up the fire and
shouted with the result that the lions moved off

Mashune I said do you watch till the moon gets over that tree
when it will be the middle of the night Then wake me Watch well now
or the lions will be picking those worthless bones of yours before you
are three hours older I must rest a little or I shall die

Koos chief answered the Zulu Sleep my father sleep in peace
my eyes shall be open as the stars and like the stars watch over you

Although I was so weak I could not at once follow his advice To begin
with my head ached with fever and I was torn with anxiety as to the
fate of the Hottentot Hans and indeed as to our own fate left
with sore feet empty stomachs and two cartridges to find our way to
Bamangwato forty miles off Then the mere sensation of knowing that
there are one or more hungry lions prowling round you somewhere in the
dark is disquieting however well one may be used to it and by keeping
the attention on the stretch tends to prevent one from sleeping In
addition to all these troubles too I was I remember seized with
a dreadful longing for a pipe of tobacco whereas under the
circumstances I might as well have longed for the moon

At last however I fell into an uneasy sleep as full of bad dreams as
a prickly pear is of points one of which I recollect was that I was
setting my naked foot upon a cobra which rose upon its tail and hissed
my name Macumazahn into my ear Indeed the cobra hissed with such
persistency that at last I roused myself

_Macumazahn nanzia nanzia_ there there whispered Mashunes
voice into my drowsy ears Raising myself I opened my eyes and I saw
Mashune kneeling by my side and pointing towards the water Following
the line of his outstretched hand my eyes fell upon a sight that made
me jump old hunter as I was even in those days About twenty paces
from the little skerm was a large antheap and on the summit of the
antheap her four feet rather close together so as to find standing
space stood the massive form of a big lioness Her head was towards the
skerm and in the bright moonlight I saw her lower it and lick her paws

Mashune thrust the Martini rifle into my hands whispering that it was
loaded I lifted it and covered the lioness but found that even in that
light I could not make out the foresight of the Martini As it would be
madness to fire without doing so for the result would probably be that
I should wound the lioness if indeed I did not miss her altogether I
lowered the rifle and hastily tearing a fragment of paper from one of
the leaves of my pocketbook which I had been consulting just before I
went to sleep I proceeded to fix it on to the front sight But all this
took a little time and before the paper was satisfactorily arranged
Mashune again gripped me by the arm and pointed to a dark heap under
the shade of a small mimosa tree which grew not more than ten paces from
the skerm

Well what is it I whispered I can see nothing

It is another lion he answered

Nonsense thy heart is dead with fear thou seest double and I bent
forward over the edge of the surrounding fence and stared at the heap

Even as I said the words the dark mass rose and stalked out into the
moonlight It was a magnificent blackmaned lion one of the largest
I had ever seen When he had gone two or three steps he caught sight of
me halted and stood there gazing straight towards ushe was so close
that I could see the firelight reflected in his wicked greenish eyes

Shoot shoot said Mashune The devil is cominghe is going to
spring

I raised the rifle and got the bit of paper on the foresight straight
on to a little path of white hair just where the throat is set into
the chest and shoulders As I did so the lion glanced back over his
shoulder as according to my experience a lion nearly always does
before he springs Then he dropped his body a little and I saw his big
paws spread out upon the ground as he put his weight on them to gather
purchase In haste I pressed the trigger of the Martini and not a
moment too soon for as I did so he was in the act of springing The
report of the rifle rang out sharp and clear on the intense silence of
the night and in another second the great brute had landed on his
head within four feet of us and rolling over and over towards us
was sending the bushes which composed our little fence flying with
convulsive strokes of his great paws We sprang out of the other side of
the skerm and he rolled on to it and into it and then right through
the fire Next he raised himself and sat upon his haunches like a great
dog and began to roar Heavens how he roared I never heard anything
like it before or since He kept filling his lungs with air and then
emitting it in the most heartshaking volumes of sound Suddenly in the
middle of one of the loudest roars he rolled over on to his side and
lay still and I knew that he was dead A lion generally dies upon his
side

With a sigh of relief I looked up towards his mate upon the antheap
She was standing there apparently petrified with astonishment looking
over her shoulder and lashing her tail but to our intense joy when
the dying beast ceased roaring she turned and with one enormous
bound vanished into the night

Then we advanced cautiously towards the prostrate brute Mashune
droning an improvised Zulu song as he went about how Macumazahn the
hunter of hunters whose eyes are open by night as well as by day put
his hand down the lions stomach when it came to devour him and
pulled out his heart by the roots c c by way of expressing his
satisfaction in his hyperbolical Zulu way at the turn events had
taken

There was no need for caution the lion was as dead as though he had
already been stuffed with straw The Martini bullet had entered within
an inch of the white spot I had aimed at and travelled right through
him passing out at the right buttock near the root of the tail The
Martini has wonderful driving power though the shock it gives to the
system is comparatively speaking slight owing to the smallness of the
hole it makes But fortunately the lion is an easy beast to kill

I passed the rest of that night in a profound slumber my head reposing
upon the deceased lions flank a position that had I thought a
beautiful touch of irony about it though the smell of his singed hair
was disagreeable When I woke again the faint primrose lights of dawn
were flushing in the eastern sky For a moment I could not understand
the chill sense of anxiety that lay like a lump of ice at my heart till
the feel and smell of the skin of the dead lion beneath my head recalled
the circumstances in which we were placed I rose and eagerly looked
round to see if I could discover any signs of Hans who if he had
escaped accident would surely return to us at dawn but there were
none Then hope grew faint and I felt that it was not well with the
poor fellow Setting Mashune to build up the fire I hastily removed the
hide from the flank of the lion which was indeed a splendid beast
and cutting off some lumps of flesh we toasted and ate them greedily
Lions flesh strange as it may seem is very good eating and tastes
more like veal than anything else

By the time we had finished our muchneeded meal the sun was getting
up and after a drink of water and a wash at the pool we started to
try and find Hans leaving the dead lion to the tender mercies of the
hyaenas Both Mashune and myself were by constant practice pretty
good hands at tracking and we had not much difficulty in following
the Hottentots spoor faint as it was We had gone on in this way for
halfanhour or so and were perhaps a mile or more from the site
of our campingplace when we discovered the spoor of a solitary bull
buffalo mixed up with the spoor of Hans and were able from various
indications to make out that he had been tracking the buffalo At
length we reached a little glade in which there grew a stunted old
mimosa thorn with a peculiar and overhanging formation of root under
which a porcupine or an antbear or some such animal had hollowed
out a widelipped hole About ten or fifteen paces from this thorntree
there was a thick patch of bush

See Macumazahn see said Mashune excitedly as we drew near the
thorn the buffalo has charged him Look here he stood to fire at him
see how firmly he planted his feet upon the earth there is the mark of
his crooked toe Hans had one bent toe Look here the bull came like
a boulder down the hill his hoofs turning up the earth like a hoe Hans
had hit him he bled as he came there are the blood spots It is all
written down there my fatherthere upon the earth

Yes I said yes but _where is Hans_

Even as I said it Mashune clutched my arm and pointed to the stunted
thorn just by us Even now gentlemen it makes me feel sick when I
think of what I saw

For fixed in a stout fork of the tree some eight feet from the ground
was Hans himself or rather his dead body evidently tossed there by the
furious buffalo One leg was twisted round the fork probably in a dying
convulsion In the side just beneath the ribs was a great hole from
which the entrails protruded But this was not all The other leg hung
down to within five feet of the ground The skin and most of the flesh
were gone from it For a moment we stood aghast and gazed at this
horrifying sight Then I understood what had happened The buffalo with
that devilish cruelty which distinguishes the animal had after his
enemy was dead stood underneath his body and licked the flesh off
the pendant leg with his filelike tongue I had heard of such a thing
before but had always treated the stories as hunters yarns but I had
no doubt about it now Poor Hans skeleton foot and ankle were an ample
proof

We stood aghast under the tree and stared and stared at this awful
sight when suddenly our cogitations were interrupted in a painful
manner The thick bush about fifteen paces off burst asunder with a
crashing sound and uttering a series of ferocious piglike grunts the
bull buffalo himself came charging out straight at us Even as he came
I saw the blood mark on his side where poor Hans bullet had struck him
and also as is often the case with particularly savage buffaloes that
his flanks had recently been terribly torn in an encounter with a lion

On he came his head well up a buffalo does not generally lower his
head till he does so to strike those great black hornsas I look at
them before me gentlemen I seem to see them come charging at me as I
did ten years ago silhouetted against the green bush behindon on

With a shout Mashune bolted off sideways towards the bush I had
instinctively lifted my eightbore which I had in my hand It would
have been useless to fire at the buffalos head for the dense horns
must have turned the bullet but as Mashune bolted the bull slewed a
little with the momentary idea of following him and as this gave me
a ghost of a chance I let drive my only cartridge at his shoulder The
bullet struck the shoulderblade and smashed it up and then travelled
on under the skin into his flank but it did not stop him though for a
second he staggered

Throwing myself on to the ground with the energy of despair I rolled
under the shelter of the projecting root of the thorn crushing myself
as far into the mouth of the antbear hole as I could In a single
instant the buffalo was after me Kneeling down on his uninjured
kneefor one leg that of which I had broken the shoulder was swinging
helplessly to and frohe set to work to try and hook me out of the hole
with his crooked horn At first he struck at me furiously and it was
one of the blows against the base of the tree which splintered the tip
of the horn in the way that you see Then he grew more cunning
and pushed his head as far under the root as possible made long
semicircular sweeps at me grunting furiously and blowing saliva and
hot steamy breath all over me I was just out of reach of the horn
though every stroke by widening the hole and making more room for his
head brought it closer to me but every now and again I received heavy
blows in the ribs from his muzzle Feeling that I was being knocked
silly I made an effort and seizing his rough tongue which was hanging
from his jaws I twisted it with all my force The great brute bellowed
with pain and fury and jerked himself backwards so strongly that he
dragged me some inches further from the mouth of the hole and again
made a sweep at me catching me this time round the shoulderjoint in
the hook of his horn

I felt that it was all up now and began to holloa

He has got me I shouted in mortal terror _Gwasa Mashune gwasa_
Stab Mashune stab

One hoist of the great head and out of the hole I came like a
periwinkle out of his shell But even as I did so I caught sight of
Mashunes stalwart form advancing with his bangwan or broad stabbing
assegai raised above his head In another quarter of a second I had
fallen from the horn and heard the blow of the spear followed by
the indescribable sound of steel shearing its way through flesh I had
fallen on my back and looking up I saw that the gallant Mashune had
driven the assegai a foot or more into the carcass of the buffalo and
was turning to fly

Alas it was too late Bellowing madly and spouting blood from mouth
and nostrils the devilish brute was on him and had thrown him up like
a feather and then gored him twice as he lay I struggled up with some
wild idea of affording help but before I had gone a step the buffalo
gave one long sighing bellow and rolled over dead by the side of his
victim

Mashune was still living but a single glance at him told me that his
hour had come The buffalos horn had driven a great hole in his right
lung and inflicted other injuries

I knelt down beside him in the uttermost distress and took his hand

Is he dead Macumazahn he whispered My eyes are blind I cannot

Yes he is dead

Did the black devil hurt thee Macumazahn

No my poor fellow I am not much hurt

Ow I am glad

Then came a long silence broken only by the sound of the air whistling
through the hole in his lung as he breathed

Macumazahn art thou there I cannot feel thee

I am here Mashune

I die Macumazahnthe world flies round and round I goI go out
into the dark Surely my father at times in days to comethou wilt
think of Mashune who stood by thy sidewhen thou killest elephants as
we usedas we used

They were his last words his brave spirit passed with him I dragged
his body to the hole under the tree and pushed it in placing his broad
assegai by him according to the custom of his people that he might not
go defenceless on his long journey and then ladiesI am not ashamed
to confessI stood alone there before it and wept like a woman
