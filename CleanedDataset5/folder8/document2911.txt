ACT I

 The scene is the managing clerks room at the offices of James
 and Walter How on a July morning The room is old fashioned
 furnished with wellworn mahogany and leather and lined with
 tin boxes and estate plans It has three doors Two of them
 are close together in the centre of a wall One of these two
 doors leads to the outer office which is only divided from the
 managing clerks room by a partition of wood and clear glass
 and when the door into this outer office is opened there can be
 seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of
 the building The other of these two centre doors leads to
 the junior clerks room The third door is that leading to the
 partners room

 The managing clerk COKESON is sitting at his table adding up
 figures in a passbook and murmuring their numbers to himself
 He is a man of sixty wearing spectacles rather short with a
 bald head and an honest pugdog face He is dressed in a
 wellworn black frockcoat and pepperandsalt trousers

COKESON And fives twelve and threefifteen nineteen
twentythree thirtytwo fortyoneand carry four He ticks the
page and goes on murmuring Five seven twelve seventeen
twentyfour and nine thirtythree thirteen and carry one

 He again makes a tick The outer office door is opened and
 SWEEDLE the officeboy appears closing the door behind him
 He is a pale youth of sixteen with spiky hair

COKESON With grumpy expectation And carry one

SWEEDLE Theres a party wants to see Falder Mr Cokeson

COKESON Five nine sixteen twentyone twentynineand carry
two Send him to Morriss What name

SWEEDLE Honeywill

COKESON Whats his business

SWEEDLE Its a woman

COKESON A lady

SWEEDLE No a person

COKESON Ask her in Take this passbook to Mr James He closes
the passbook

SWEEDLE Reopening the door Will you come in please

 RUTH HONEYWILL comes in She is a tall woman twentysix years
 old unpretentiously dressed with black hair and eyes and an
 ivorywhite clearcut face She stands very still having a
 natural dignity of pose and gesture

 SWEEDLE goes out into the partners room with the passbook

COKESON Looking round at RUTH The young mans out
Suspiciously State your business please

RUTH Who speaks in a matteroffact voice and with a slight
WestCountry accent Its a personal matter sir

COKESON We dont allow private callers here Will you leave a
message

RUTH Id rather see him please

 She narrows her dark eyes and gives him a honeyed look

COKESON Expanding Its all against the rules Suppose I had my
friends here to see me Itd never do

RUTH No sir

COKESON A little taken aback Exactly And here you are wanting
to see a junior clerk

RUTH Yes sir I must see him

COKESON Turning full round to her with a sort of outraged
interest But this is a lawyers office Go to his private address

RUTH Hes not there

COKESON Uneasy Are you related to the party

RUTH No sir

COKESON In real embarrassment I dont know what to say Its no
affair of the office

RUTH But what am I to do

COKESON Dear me I cant tell you that

 SWEEDLE comes back He crosses to the outer office and passes
 through into it with a quizzical look at Cokeson carefully
 leaving the door an inch or two open

COKESON Fortified by this look This wont do you know this
wont do at all Suppose one of the partners came in

 An incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer
 door of the outer office

SWEEDLE Putting his head in Theres some children outside here

RUTH Theyre mine please

SWEEDLE Shall I hold them in check

RUTH Theyre quite small sir She takes a step towards COKESON

COKESON You mustnt take up his time in office hours were a clerk
short as it is

RUTH Its a matter of life and death

COKESON Again outraged Life and death

SWEEDLE Here is Falder

 FALDER has entered through the outer office He is a pale
 goodlooking young man with quick rather scared eyes He
 moves towards the door of the clerks office and stands there
 irresolute

COKESON Well Ill give you a minute Its not regular

 Taking up a bundle of papers he goes out into the partners
 room

RUTH In a low hurried voice Hes on the drink again Will He
tried to cut my throat last night I came out with the children
before he was awake I went round to you

FALDER Ive changed my digs

RUTH Is it all ready for tonight

FALDER Ive got the tickets Meet me 1145 at the booking office
For Gods sake dont forget were man and wife Looking at her with
tragic intensity Ruth

RUTH Youre not afraid of going are you

FALDER Have you got your things and the childrens

RUTH Had to leave them for fear of waking Honeywill all but one
bag I cant go near home again

FALDER Wincing All that money gone for nothing
How much must you have

RUTH Six poundsI could do with that I think

FALDER Dont give away where were going As if to himself When
I get out there I mean to forget it all

RUTH If youre sorry say so Id sooner he killed me than take
you against your will

FALDER With a queer smile Weve got to go I dont care Ill
have you

RUTH Youve just to say its not too late

FALDER It is too late Heres seven pounds Booking office 1145
tonight If you werent what you are to me Ruth

RUTH Kiss me

 They cling together passionately there fly apart just as
 COKESON reenters the room RUTH turns and goes out through the
 outer office COKESON advances deliberately to his chair and
 seats himself

COKESON This isnt right Falder

FALDER It shant occur again sir

COKESON Its an improper use of these premises

FALDER Yes sir

COKESON You quite understandthe party was in some distress and
having children with her I allowed my feelingsHe opens a
drawer and produces from it a tract Just take this Purity in the
Home Its a wellwritten thing

FALDER Taking it with a peculiar expression Thank you sir

COKESON And look here Falder before Mr Walter comes have you
finished up that cataloguing Davis had in hand before he left

FALDER I shall have done with it tomorrow sirfor good

COKESON Its over a week since Davis went Now it wont do
Falder Youre neglecting your work for private life I shant
mention about the party having called but

FALDER Passing into his room Thank you sir

 COKESON stares at the door through which FALDER has gone out
 then shakes his head and is just settling down to write when
 WALTER How comes in through the outer Office He is a rather
 refinedlooking man of thirtyfive with a pleasant almost
 apologetic voice

WALTER Goodmorning Cokeson

COKESON Morning Mr Walter

WALTER My father here

COKESON Always with a certain patronage as to a young man who
might be doing better Mr James has been here since eleven oclock

WALTER Ive been in to see the pictures at the Guildhall

COKESON Looking at him as though this were exactly what was to be
expected Have you nowyees This lease of Boultersam I to
send it to counsel

WALTER What does my father say

COKESON Avent bothered him

WALTER Well we cant be too careful

COKESON Its such a little thinghardly worth the fees I thought
youd do it yourself

WALTER Send it please I dont want the responsibility

COKESON With an indescribable air of compassion Just as you
like This rightofway caseweve got em on the deeds

WALTER I know but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit
of common ground

COKESON We neednt worry about that Were the right side of the
law

WALTER I dont like it

COKESON With an indulgent smile We shant want to set ourselves
up against the law Your father wouldnt waste his time doing that

 As he speaks JAMES How comes in from the partners room He is
 a shortish man with white sidewhiskers plentiful grey hair
 shrewd eyes and gold pincenez

JAMES Morning Walter

WALTER How are you father

COKESON Looking down his nose at the papers in his hand as though
deprecating their size Ill just take Boulters lease in to young
Falder to draft the instructions He goes out into FALDERS room

WALTER About that rightofway case

JAMES Oh well we must go forward there I thought you told me

JAMES Gravely Lets look at that ninety cheque He sorts the

compassion Here let me see Youve got the wrong cheque

 He takes chequebook and passbook from WALTER

WALTER Afraid not

COKESON Having seen for himself Its funny

JAMES You gave it to Davis and Davis sailed for Australia on
Monday Looks black Cokeson

COKESON Puzzled and upset why thisd be a felony No no

JAMES I hope so

COKESON Theres never been anything of that sort in the office the

JAMES Looking at cheque and counterfoil This is a very clever
bit of work a warning to you not to leave space after your figures

WALTER Really

 He goes out through the outer office JAMES paces the room He
 stops and looks at COKESON who is disconsolately rubbing the
 knees of his trousers

JAMES Well Cokeson Theres something in character isnt there

COKESON Looking at him over his spectacles I dont quite take

JAMES Your story would sound dd thin to any one who didnt

COKESON Yees He laughs Then with a sudden gravity Im sorry

JAMES A nasty business

COKESON It unsettles you All goes on regular and then a thing

JAMES I hope that fellow will hurry up

COKESON Keeping things pleasant for the cashier It isnt fifty
yards Mr James He wont be a minute

JAMES The idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard
Cokeson

 He goes towards the door of the partners room

SWEEDLE Entering quietly to COKESON in a low voice Shes popped
up again sirsomething she forgot to say to Falder

COKESON Roused from his abstraction Eh Impossible Send her

JAMES Whats that

COKESON Reely Reely I cant have it If you want him wait

RUTH Yes sir

 WALTER entering with the cashier passes RUTH as she leaves the
 outer office

COKESON To the cashier who resembles a sedentary dragoon
Goodmorning To WALTER Your fathers in there

 WALTER crosses and goes into the partners room

COKESON Its a nahsty unpleasant little matter Mr Cowley Im
quite ashamed to have to trouble you

COWLEY I remember the cheque quite well As if it were a liver
Seemed in perfect order

COKESON Sit down wont you Im not a sensitive man but a thing
like this about the placeits not nice I like people to be open
and jolly together

COWLEY Quite so

COKESON Buttonholing him and glancing toward the partners room
Of course hes a young man Ive told him about it before now
leaving space after his figures but he will do it

COWLEY I should remember the persons facequite a youth

COKESON I dont think we shall be able to show him to you as a
matter of fact

 JAMES and WALTER have come back from the partners room

JAMES Goodmorning Mr Cowley Youve seen my son and myself
youve seen Mr Cokeson and youve seen Sweedle my officeboy It
was none of us I take it

 The cashier shakes his head with a smile

JAMES Be so good as to sit there Cokeson engage Mr Cowley in
conversation will you

 He goes toward FALDERS room

COKESON Just a word Mr James

JAMES Well

COKESON You dont want to upset the young man in there do you
Hes a nervous young feller

JAMES This must be thoroughly cleared up Cokeson for the sake of
Falders name to say nothing of yours

COKESON With Some dignity Thatll look after itself sir Hes
been upset once this morning I dont want him startled again

JAMES Its a matter of form but I cant stand upon niceness over a
thing like thistoo serious Just talk to Mr Cowley

 He opens the door of FALDERS room

JAMES Bring in the papers in Boulters lease will you Falder

COKESON Bursting into voice Do you keep dogs

 The cashier with his eyes fixed on the door does not answer

COKESON You havent such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare
me I suppose

 At the look on the cashiers face his jaw drops and he turns to
 see FALDER standing in the doorway with his eyes fixed on
 COWLEY like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake

FALDER Advancing with the papers Here they are sir

JAMES Taking them Thank you

FALDER Do you want me sir

JAMES No thanks

 FALDER turns and goes back into his own room As he shuts the
 door JAMES gives the cashier an interrogative look and the
 cashier nods

JAMES Sure This isnt as we suspected

COWLEY Quite He knew me I suppose he cant slip out of that
room

COKESON Gloomily Theres only the windowa whole floor and a
basement

 The door of FALDERS room is quietly opened and FALDER with
 his hat in his hand moves towards the door of the outer office

JAMES Quietly Where are you going Falder

FALDER To have my lunch sir

JAMES Wait a few minutes would you I want to speak to you about
this lease

FALDER Yes sir He goes back into his room

COWLEY If Im wanted I can swear thats the young man who cashed
the cheque It was the last cheque I handled that morning before my
lunch These are the numbers of the notes he had He puts a slip
of paper on the table then brushing his hat round Goodmorning

JAMES Goodmorning Mr Cowley

COWLEY To COKESON Goodmorning

COKESON With Stupefaction Goodmorning

 The cashier goes out through the outer office COKESON sits down
 in his chair as though it were the only place left in the
 morass of his feelings

WALTER What are you going to do

JAMES Have him in Give me the cheque and the counterfoil

COKESON I dont understand I thought young Davis

JAMES We shall see

WALTER One moment father have you thought it out

JAMES Call him in

COKESON Rising with difficulty and opening FALDERS door
hoarsely Step in here a minute

FALDER Impassively Yes sir

JAMES Turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out You know
this cheque Falder

FALDER No sir

JADES Look at it You cashed it last Friday week

FALDER Oh yes sir that oneDavis gave it me

JAMES I know And you gave Davis the cash

FALDER Yes sir

JAMES When Davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this

FALDER Yes I think so sir

JAMES You know that Mr Walter drew that cheque for nine pounds

FALDER No sirninety

JAMES Nine Falder

FALDER Faintly I dont understand sir

JAMES The suggestion of course is that the cheque was altered
whether by you or Davis is the question

FALDER II

COKESON Take your time take your time

FALDER Regaining his impassivity Not by me sir

JAMES The cheque was handed toCokeson by Mr Walter at one
oclock we know that because Mr Cokesons lunch had just arrived

COKESON I couldnt leave it

JAMES Exactly he therefore gave the cheque to Davis It was
cashed by you at 115 We know that because the cashier recollects
it for the last cheque he handled before his lunch

FALDER Yes sir Davis gave it to me because some friends were
giving him a farewell luncheon

JAMES Puzzled You accuse Davis then

FALDER I dont know sirits very funny

 WALTER who has come close to his father says something to him
 in a low voice

JAMES Davis was not here again after that Saturday was he

COKESON Anxious to be of assistance to the young man and seeing
faint signs of their all being jolly once more No he sailed on the
Monday

JAMES Was he Falder

FALDER Very faintly No sir

JAMES Very well then how do you account for the fact that this
nought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after Tuesday

COKESON Surprised Hows that

 FALDER gives a sort of lurch he tries to pull himself together
 but he has gone all to pieces

JAMES Very grimly Out Im afraid Cokeson The chequebook
remained in Mr Walters pocket till he came back from Trenton on
Tuesday morning In the face of this Falder do you still deny that
you altered both cheque and counterfoil

FALDER No sirno Mr How I did it sir I did it

COKESON Succumbing to his feelings Dear dear what a thing to
do

FALDER I wanted the money so badly sir I didnt know what I was
doing

COKESON However such a thing could have come into your head

FALDER Grasping at the words I cant think sir really It was
just a minute of madness

JAMES A long minute Falder Tapping the counterfoil Four days
at least

FALDER Sir I swear I didnt know what Id done till afterwards
and then I hadnt the pluck Oh Sir look over it Ill pay the
money backI will I promise

JAMES Go into your room

 FALDER with a swift imploring look goes back into his room
 There is silence

JAMES About as bad a case as there could be

COKESON To break the law like thatin here

WALTER Whats to be done

JAMES Nothing for it Prosecute

WALTER Its his first offence

JAMES Shaking his head Ive grave doubts of that Too neat a
piece of swindling altogether

COKESON I shouldnt be surprised if he was tempted

JAMES Lifes one long temptation Cokeson

COKESON Yees but Im speaking of the flesh and the devil Mr
James There was a woman come to see him this morning

WALTER The woman we passed as we came in just now Is it his wife

COKESON No no relation Restraining what in jollier
circumstances would have been a wink A married person though

WALTER How do you know

COKESON Brought her children Scandalised There they were
outside the office

JAMES A real bad egg

WALTER I should like to give him a chance

JAMES I cant forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work
counting on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light
It was the merest accident the chequebook stayed in your pocket

WALTER It must have been the temptation of a moment He hadnt
time

JAMES A man doesnt succumb like that in a moment if hes a clean
mind and habits Hes rotten got the eyes of a man who cant keep
his hands off when theres money about

WALTER Dryly We hadnt noticed that before

JAMES Brushing the remark aside Ive seen lots of those fellows
in my time No doing anything with them except to keep em out of
harms way Theyve got a blind spat

WALTER Its penal servitude

COKESON Theyre nahsty placesprisons

JAMES Hesitating I dont see how its possible to spare him Out
of the question to keep him in this officehonestys the sine qua
non

COKESON Hypnotised Of course it is

JAMES Equally out of the question to send him out amongst people
whove no knowledge of his character One must think of society

WALTER But to brand him like this

JAMES If it had been a straightforward case Id give him another
chance Its far from that He has dissolute habits

COKESON I didnt say thatextenuating circumstances

JAMES Same thing Hes gone to work in the most coldblooded way
to defraud his employers and cast the blame on an innocent man If
thats not a case for the law to take its course I dont know what
is

WALTER For the sake of his future though

JAMES Sarcastically According to you no one would ever
prosecute

WALTER Nettled I hate the idea of it

COKESON Thats rather ex parte Mr Walter We must have
protection

JAMES This is degenerating into talk

 He moves towards the partners room

WALTER Put yourself in his place father

JAMES You ask too much of me

WALTER We cant possibly tell the pressure there was on him

JAMES You may depend on it my boy if a man is going to do this
sort of thing hell do it pressure or no pressure if he isnt
nothingll make him

WALTER Hell never do it again

COKESON Fatuously Spose I were to have a talk with him We
dont want to be hard on the young man

JAMES Thatll do Cokeson Ive made up my mind He passes into
the partners room

COKESON After a doubtful moment We must excuse your father I
dont want to go against your father if he thinks it right

WALTER Confound it Cokeson why dont you back me up You know
you feel

COKESON On his dignity I really cant say what I feel

WALTER We shall regret it

COKESON He must have known what he was doing

WALTER Bitterly The quality of mercy is not strained

COKESON Looking at him askance Come come Mr Walter We must
try and see it sensible

SWEEDLE Entering with a tray Your lunch sir

COKESON Put it down

 While SWEEDLE is putting it down on COKESONs table the
 detective WISTER enters the outer office and finding no one
 there comes to the inner doorway He is a square mediumsized
 man cleanshaved in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong
 boots

COKESON Hoarsely Here Here What are we doing

WISTER To WALTER From Scotland Yard sir DetectiveSergeant
Blister

WALTER Askance Very well Ill speak to my father

 He goes into the partners room JAMES enters

JAMES Morning In answer to an appealing gesture from COKESON
Im sorry Id stop short of this if I felt I could Open that door
SWEEDLE wondering and scared opens it Come here Mr Falder

 As FALDER comes shrinkingly out the detective in obedience to a
 sign from JAMES slips his hand out and grasps his arm

FALDER Recoiling Oh nooh no

WALTER Come come theres a good lad

JAMES I charge him with felony

FALTER Oh sir Theres some oneI did it for her Let me be
till tomorrow

 JAMES motions with his hand At that sign of hardness FALDER
 becomes rigid Then turning he goes out quietly in the
 detectives grip JAMES follows stiff and erect SWEEDLE
 rushing to the door with open mouth pursues them through the
 outer office into the corridor When they have all disappeared
 COKESON spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer
 office

COKESON Hoarsely Here What are we doing

 There is silence He takes out his handkerchief and mops the
 sweat from his face Going back blindly to his table sits
 down and stares blankly at his lunch


 The curtain falls





ACT II

A Court of Justice on a foggy October afternoon crowded with
barristers solicitors reporters ushers and jurymen Sitting in
the large solid dock is FALDER with a warder on either side of him
placed there for his safe custody but seemingly indifferent to and
unconscious of his presence FALDER is sitting exactly opposite to
the JUDGE who raised above the clamour of the court also seems
unconscious of and indifferent to everything HAROLD CLEAVER the
counsel for the Crown is a dried yellowish man of more than middle
age in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face HECTOR FROME
the counsel for the defence is a young tall man clean shaved in a
very white wig Among the spectators having already given their
evidence are JAMES and WALTER HOW and COWLEY the cashier WISTER
the detective is just leaving the witnessbox

CLEAVER That is the case for the Crown me lud

 Gathering his robes together he sits down

FROME Rising and bowing to the JUDGE If it please your lordship
and gentlemen of the jury I am not going to dispute the fact that
the prisoner altered this cheque but I am going to put before you
evidence as to the condition of his mind and to submit that you
would not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his
actions at the time I am going to show you in fact that he did
this in a moment of aberration amounting to temporary insanity
caused by the violent distress under which he was labouring
Gentlemen the prisoner is only twentythree years old I shall call
before you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to
this act You will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances
of her life the still more tragic infatuation with which she has
inspired the prisoner This woman gentlemen has been leading a
miserable existence with a husband who habitually illuses her from
whom she actually goes in terror of her life I am not of course
saying that its either right or desirable for a young man to fall in
love with a married woman or that its his business to rescue her
from an ogrelike husband Im not saying anything of the sort But
we all know the power of the passion of love and I would ask you to
remember gentlemen in listening to her evidence that married to a
drunken and violent husband she has no power to get rid of him for
as you know another offence besides violence is necessary to enable
a woman to obtain a divorce and of this offence it does not appear
that her husband is guilty

JUDGE Is this relevant Mr Frome

FROME My lord I submit extremelyI shall be able to show your
lordship that directly

JUDGE Very well

FROME In these circumstances what alternatives were left to her
She could either go on living with this drunkard in terror of her
life or she could apply to the Court for a separation order Well
gentlemen my experience of such cases assures me that this would
have given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such
a man and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her
either to the workhouse or the streetsfor its not easy as she is
now finding for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to
support herself and her children without resorting either to the Poor
Law orto speak quite plainlyto the sale of her body

JUDGE You are ranging rather far Mr Frome

FROME I shall fire pointblank in a minute my lord

JUDGE Let us hope so

FROME Now gentlemen markand this is what I have been leading up
tothis woman will tell you and the prisoner will confirm her
that confronted with such alternatives she set her whole hopes on
himself knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him She
saw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country where
they would both be unknown and might pass as husband and wife This
was a desperate and as my friend Mr Cleaver will no doubt call it
an immoral resolution but as a fact the minds of both of them were
constantly turned towards it One wrong is no excuse for another
and those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation
possibly have the right to hold up their handsas to that I prefer
to say nothing But whatever view you take gentlemen of this part
of the prisoners storywhatever opinion you form of the right of
these two young people under such circumstances to take the law into
their own handsthe fact remains that this young woman in her
distress and this young man little more than a boy who was so
devotedly attached to her did conceive thisif you like
reprehensible design of going away together Now for that of
course they required money andthey had none As to the actual
events of the morning of July 7th on which this cheque was altered
the events on which I rely to prove the defendants irresponsibility
I shall allow those events to speak for themselves through the
lips of my witness Robert Cokeson He turns looks round takes
up a sheet of paper and waits

 COKESON is summoned into court and goes into the witnessbox
 holding his hat before him The oath is administered to him

FROME What is your name

COKESON Robert Cokeson

FROME Are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ
the prisoner

COKESON Yees

FROME How long had the prisoner been in their employ

COKESON Two years No Im wrong thereall but seventeen days

FROME Had you him under your eye all that time

COKESON Except Sundays and holidays

FROME Quite so Let us hear please what you have to say about
his general character during those two years

COKESON Confidentially to the jury and as if a little surprised
at being asked He was a nice pleasantspoken young man Id no
fault to find with himquite the contrary It was a great surprise
to me when he did a thing like that

FROME Did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty

COKESON No To have dishonesty in our office thatd never do

FROME Im sure the jury fully appreciate that Mr Cokeson

COKESON Every man of business knows that honestys the sign qua
non

FROME Do you give him a good character all round or do you not

COKESON Turning to the JUDGE Certainly We were all very jolly
and pleasant together until this happened Quite upset me

FROME Now coming to the morning of the 7th of July the morning on
which the cheque was altered What have you to say about his
demeanour that morning

COKESON To the jury If you ask me I dont think he was quite
compos when he did it

THE JUDGE Sharply Are you suggesting that he was insane

COKESON Not compos

THE JUDGE A little more precision please

FROME Smoothly Just tell us Mr Cokeson

COKESON Somewhat outraged Well in my opinionlooking at the
JUDGEsuch as it ishe was jumpy at the time The jury will
understand my meaning

FROME Will you tell us how you came to that conclusion

COKESON Yees I will I have my lunch in from the restaurant a
chop and a potatosaves time That day it happened to come just as
Mr Walter How handed me the cheque Well I like it hot so I went
into the clerks office and I handed the cheque to Davis the other
clerk and told him to get change I noticed young Falder walking up
and down I said to him This is not the Zoological Gardens
Falder

FROME Do you remember what he answered

COKESON Yees I wish to God it were Struck me as funny

FROME Did you notice anything else peculiar

COKESON I did

FROME What was that

COKESON His collar was unbuttoned Now I like a young man to be
neat I said to him Your collars unbuttoned

FROME And what did he answer

COKESON Stared at me It wasnt nice

THE JUDGE Stared at you Isnt that a very common practice

COKESON Yees but it was the look in his eyes I cant explain my
meaningit was funny

FROME Had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before

COKESON No If I had I should have spoken to the partners We
cant have anything eccentric in our profession

THE JUDGE Did you speak to them on that occasion

COKESON Confidentially Well I didnt like to trouble them about
prime facey evidence

FROME But it made a very distinct impression on your mind

COKESON Yees The clerk Davis could have told you the same

FROME Quite so Its very unfortunate that weve not got him here
Now can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the
forgery was made That would be the 18th Did anything happen that
morning

COKESON With his hand to his ear Im a little deaf

FROME Was there anything in the course of that morningI mean
before the discoverythat caught your attention

COKESON Yeesa woman

THE JUDGE How is this relevant Mr Frome

FROME I am trying to establish the state of mind in which the
prisoner committed this act my lord

THE JUDGE I quite appreciate that But this was long after the
act

FROME Yes my lord but it contributes to my contention

THE JUDGE Well

FROME You say a woman Do you mean that she came to the office

COKESON Yees

FROME What for

COKESON Asked to see young Falder he was out at the moment

FROME Did you see her

COKESON I did

FROME Did she come alone

COKESON Confidentially Well there you put me in a difficulty
I mustnt tell you what the officeboy told me

FROME Quite so Mr Cokeson quite so

COKESON Breaking in with an air of You are youngleave it to
me But I think we can get round it In answer to a question put
to her by a third party the woman said to me Theyre mine sir

THE JUDGE What are What were

COKESON Her children They were outside

THE JUDGE HOW do you know

COKESON Your lordship mustnt ask me that or I shall have to tell
you what I was toldand thatd never do

THE JUDGE Smiling The officeboy made a statement

COKESON Eggzactly

FROME What I want to ask you Mr Cokeson is this In the course
of her appeal to see Falder did the woman say anything that you
specially remember

COKESON Looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the
sentence A leetle more sir

FROME Or did she not

COKESON She did I shouldnt like you to have led me to the
answer

FROME With an irritated smile Will you tell the jury what it
was

COKESON Its a matter of life and death

FOREMAN OF THE JURY Do you mean the woman said that

COKESON Nodding Its not the sort of thing you like to have said
to you

FROME A little impatiently Did Falder come in while she was
there COKESON nods And she saw him and went away

COKESON Ah there I cant follow you I didnt see her go

FROME Well is she there now

COKESON With an indulgent smile No

FROME Thank you Mr Cokeson He sits down

CLEAVER Rising You say that on the morning of the forgery the
prisoner was jumpy Well now sir what precisely do you mean by
that word

COKESON Indulgently I want you to understand Have you ever
seen a dog thats lost its master He was kind of everywhere at once
with his eyes

CLEAVER Thank you I was coming to his eyes You called them
funny What are we to understand by that Strange or what

COKESON Yees funny

COKESON Sharply Yes sir but what may be funny to you may not
be funny to me or to the jury Did they look frightened or shy or
fierce or what

COKESON You make it very hard for me I give you the word and you
want me to give you another

CLEAVER Rapping his desk Does funny mean mad

CLEAVER Not mad fun

CLEAVER Very well Now you say he had his collar unbuttoned Was
it a hot day

COKESON Yees I think it was

CLEAVER And did he button it when you called his attention to it

COKESON Yees I think he did

CLEAVER Would you say that that denoted insanity

 He sits downs COKESON who has opened his mouth to reply is
 left gaping

FROME Rising hastily Have you ever caught him in that dishevelled
state before

COKESON No He was always clean and quiet

FROME That will do thank you

 COKESON turns blandly to the JUDGE as though to rebuke counsel
 for not remembering that the JUDGE might wish to have a chance
 arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing
 further he turns and descends from the box and sits down next
 to JAMES and WALTER

FROME Do you still love him

RUTH With her eyes on FALDER Hes ruined himself for me

FROME Thank you

 He sits down RUTH remains stoically upright in the witnessbox

CLEAVER In a considerate voice When you left him on the morning

THE JUDGE Staring at her hard Well step down please

FROME I call the prisoner my lord

 FALDER leaves the dock goes into the witnessbox and is duly
 sworn

FROME What is your name

FALDER William Falder

FROME And age

FALDER Twentythree

FROME You are not married

 FALDER shakes his head

FROME How long have you known the last witness

FALDER Six months

FROME Is her account of the relationship between you a correct one

FALDER Yes

FROME You became devotedly attached to her however

FALDER Yes

THE JUDGE Though you knew she was a married woman

FALDER I couldnt help it your lordship

THE JUDGE Couldnt help it

FALDER I didnt seem able to

 The JUDGE slightly shrugs his shoulders

FROME How did you come to know her

FALDER Through my married sister

FROME Did you know whether she was happy with her husband

FALDER It was trouble all the time

FROME You knew her husband

FALDER Only through herhes a brute

THE JUDGE I cant allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not
present

FROME Bowing If your lordship pleases To FALDER You admit
altering this cheque

FALDER bows his head

FROME Carry your mind please to the morning of Friday July the
7th and tell the jury what happened

FALDER Turning to the jury I was having my breakfast when she
came Her dress was all torn and she was gasping and couldnt seem
to get her breath at all there were the marks of his fingers round
her throat her arm was bruised and the blood had got into her eyes
dreadfully It frightened me and then when she told me I feltI
feltwellit was too much for me Hardening suddenly If youd
seen it having the feelings for her that I had youd have felt the
same I know

FROME Yes

FALDER When she left mebecause I had to go to the officeI was
out of my senses for fear that hed do it again and thinking what I
could do I couldnt workall the morning I was like thatsimply
couldnt fix my mind on anything I couldnt think at all I seemed
to have to keep moving When Davisthe other clerkgave me the
chequehe said Itll do you good Will to have a run with this
You seem half off your chump this morning Then when I had it in my
handI dont know how it came but it just flashed across me that if
I put the ty and the nought there would be the money to get her
away It just came and wentI never thought of it again Then
Davis went out to his luncheon and I dont really remember what I
did till Id pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail
I remember his saying Gold or notes Then I suppose I knew what
Id done Anyway when I got outside I wanted to chuck myself under
a bus I wanted to throw the money away but it seemed I was in for
it so I thought at any rate Id save her Of course the tickets I
took for the passage and the little I gave hers been wasted and
all except what I was obliged to spend myself Ive restored I
keep thinking over and over however it was I came to do it and how I
cant have it all again to do differently

 FALDER is silent twisting his hands before him

FROME How far is it from your office to the bank

FALDER Not more than fifty yards sir

FROME From the time Davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed
the cheque how long do you say it must have been

FALDER It couldnt have been four minutes sir because I ran all
the way

FROME During those four minutes you say you remember nothing

FALDER No sir only that I ran

FROME Not even adding the ty and the nought

FALDER No sir I dont really

 FROME sits down and CLEAVER rises

CLEAVER But you remember running do you

FALDER I was all out of breath when I got to the bank

CLEAVER And you dont remember altering the cheque

FALDER Faintly No sir

CLEAVER Divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting
over the case is this anything but an ordinary forgery Come

FALDER I was half frantic all that morning sir

CLEAVER Now now You dont deny that the ty and the nought were
so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the
cashier

FALDER It was an accident

CLEAVER Cheerfully Queer sort of accident wasnt it On which
day did you alter the counterfoil

FALDER Hanging his head On the Wednesday morning

CLEAVER Was that an accident too

FALDER Faintly No

CLEAVER To do that you had to watch your opportunity I suppose

FALDER Almost inaudibly Yes

CLEAVER You dont suggest that you were suffering under great
excitement when you did that

FALDER I was haunted

CLEAVER With the fear of being found out

FALDER Very low Yes

THE JUDGE Didnt it occur to you that the only thing for you to do
was to confess to your employers and restore the money

FALDER I was afraid There is silence

CLEAVER You desired too no doubt to complete your design of
taking this woman away

FALDER When I found Id done a thing like that to do it for
nothing seemed so dreadful I might just as well have chucked myself
into the river

CLEAVER You knew that the clerk Davis was about to leave England
didnt it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion
would fall on him

FALDER It was all done in a moment I thought of it afterwards

CLEAVER And that didnt lead you to avow what youd done

FALDER Sullenly I meant to write when I got out thereI would
have repaid the money

THE JUDGE But in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have
been prosecuted

FALDER I knew he was a long way off your lordship I thought
thered be time I didnt think theyd find it out so soon

FROME I might remind your lordship that as Mr Walter How had the
chequebook in his pocket till after Davis had sailed if the
discovery had been made only one day later Falder himself would have
left and suspicion would have attached to him and not to Davis
from the beginning

THE JUDGE The question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion
would light on himself and not on Davis To FALDER sharply Did
you know that Mr Walter How had the chequebook till after Davis
had sailed

FALDER IIthoughthe

THE JUDGE Now speak the truthyes or no

FALDER Very low No my lord I had no means of knowing

THE JUDGE That disposes of your point Mr Frome

 FROME bows to the JUDGE

CLEAVER Has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before

FALDER Faintly No sir

CLEAVER You had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that
afternoon

FALDER Yes I had to take the money back

CLEAVER You mean the nine pounds Your wits were sufficiently keen
for you to remember that And you still persist in saying you dont
remember altering this cheque He sits down

FALDER If I hadnt been mad I should never have had the courage

FROME Rising Did you have your lunch before going back

FALDER I never ate a thing all day and at night I couldnt sleep

FROME Now as to the four minutes that elapsed between Daviss
going out and your cashing the cheque do you say that you recollect
nothing during those four minutes

FALDER After a moment I remember thinking of Mr Cokesons face

FROME Of Mr Cokesons face Had that any connection with what you
were doing

FALDER No Sir

FROME Was that in the office before you ran out

FALDER Yes and while I was running

FROME And that lasted till the cashier said Will you have gold or
notes

FALDER Yes and then I seemed to come to myselfand it was too
late

FROME Thank you That closes the evidence for the defence my
lord

 The JUDGE nods and FALDER goes back to his seat in the dock

FROME Gathering up notes If it please your lordshipGentlemen
of the JuryMy friend in crossexamination has shown a disposition
to sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case and I am
free to admit that nothing I can say will move you if the evidence
has not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in
a moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not
responsible for his actions a moment of such mental and moral
vacuity arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he
had been suffering as to amount to temporary madness My friend has
alluded to the romantic glamour with which I have sought to invest
this case Gentlemen I have done nothing of the kind I have
merely shown you the background of lifethat palpitating life
which believe mewhatever my friend may sayalways lies behind the
commission of a crime Now gentlemen we live in a highly civilized
age and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange
way even when we have no personal interest in the matter But when
we see it inflicted on a woman whom we lovewhat then Just think
of what your own feelings would have been each of you at the
prisoners age and then look at him Well he is hardly the
comfortable shall we say bucolic person likely to contemplate with
equanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was
devotedly attached Yes gentlemen look at him He has not a
strong face but neither has he a vicious face He is just the sort
of man who would easily become the prey of his emotions You have
heard the description of his eyes My friend may laugh at the word
funnyI think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of
those who are strained to breakingpoint than any other word which
could have been used I dont pretend mind you that his mental
irresponsibilitywas more than a flash of darkness in which all
sense of proportion became lost but to contend that just as a man
who destroys himself at such a moment may be and often is absolved
from the stigma attaching to the crime of selfmurder so he may and
frequently does commit other crimes while in this irresponsible
condition and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent
and treated as a patient I admit that this is a plea which might
well be abused It is a matter for discretion But here you have a
case in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt
You heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four
fatal minutes What was his answer I thought of Mr Cokesons
face Gentlemen no man could invent an answer like that it is
absolutely stamped with truth You have seen the great affection
legitimate or not existing between him and this woman who came
here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life It is
impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he
committed this act We well know what terrible havoc such distress
can make in weak and highly nervous people It was all the work of a
moment The rest has followed as death follows a stab to the heart
or water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it Believe me
gentlemen there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter
impossibility of changing what you have done Once this cheque was
altered and presented the work of four minutesfour mad minutes
the rest has been silence But in those four minutes the boy
before you has slipped through a door hardly opened into that great
cage which never again quite lets a man gothe cage of the Law His
further acts his failure to confess the alteration of the
counterfoil his preparations for flight are all evidencenot of
deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from
which these subsequent acts arose nothey are merely evidence of
the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune But is a
man to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character
Gentlemen men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law
for want of that human insight which sees them as they are patients
and not criminals If the prisoner be found guilty and treated as
though he were a criminal type he will as all experience shows in
all probability become one I beg you not to return a verdict that
may thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever Gentlemen
Justice is a machine that when some one has once given it the
starting push rolls on of itself Is this young man to be ground to
pieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of
weakness Is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man
those dark illstarred ships called prisons Is that to be his
voyagefrom which so few return Or is he to have another chance to
be still looked on as one who has gone a little astray but who will
come back I urge you gentlemen do not ruin this young man For
as a result of those four minutes ruin utter and irretrievable
stares him in the face He can be saved now Imprison him as a
criminal and I affirm to you that he will be lost He has neither
the face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal
Weigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has
undergone The latter is ten times heavier already He has lain in
prison under this charge for more than two months Is he likely ever
to forget that Imagine the anguish of his mind during that time
He has had his punishment gentlemen you may depend The rolling of
the chariotwheels of Justice over this boy began when it was decided
to prosecute him We are now already at the second stage If you
permit it to go on to the third I would not givethat for him

 He holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle drops his
 hand and sits dozen

The jury stir and consult each others faces then they turn towards
the counsel for the Crown who rises and fixing his eyes on a spot
that seems to give him satisfaction slides them every now and then
towards the jury

CLEAVER May it please your lordshipRising on his toes Gentlemen
of the JuryThe facts in this case are not disputed and the
defence if my friend will allow me to say so is so thin that I
dont propose to waste the time of the Court by taking you over the
evidence The plea is one of temporary insanity Well gentlemen I
daresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this ratherwhat
shall we call itbizarre defence has been set up The alternative
would have been to plead guilty Now gentlemen if the prisoner had
pleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to
his lordship Instead of that he has gone into the byways and
hedges and found thiserpeculiar plea which has enabled him to
show you the proverbial woman to put her in the boxto give in
fact a romantic glow to this affair I compliment my friend I
think it highly ingenious of him By these means he hasto a
certain extentgot round the Law He has brought the whole story of
motive and stress out in court at first hand in a way that he would
not otherwise have been able to do But when you have once grasped
that fact gentlemen you have grasped everything With
goodhumoured contempt For look at this plea of insanity we cant
put it lower than that You have heard the woman She has every
reason to favour the prisoner but what did she say She said that
the prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning If he
were going out of his mind through distress that was obviously the
moment when insanity would have shown itself You have heard the
managing clerk another witness for the defence With some
difficulty I elicited from him the admission that the prisoner
though jumpy a word that he seemed to think you would understand
gentlemen and Im sure I hope you do was not mad when the cheque
was handed to Davis I agree with my friend that its unfortunate
that we have not got Davis here but the prisoner has told you the
words with which Davis in turn handed him the cheque he obviously
therefore was not mad when he received it or he would not have
remembered those words The cashier has told you that he was
certainly in his senses when he cashed it We have therefore the
plea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one and sane at
fifteen minutes past may for the purposes of avoiding the
consequences of a crime call himself insane between those points of
time Really gentlemen this is so peculiar a proposition that I am
not disposed to weary you with further argument You will form your
own opinion of its value My friend has adopted this way of saying a
great deal to youand very eloquentlyon the score of youth
temptation and the like I might point out however that the
offence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious
known to our law and there are certain features in this case such
as the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellowclerk
and his relations with this married woman which will render it
difficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading I
ask you in short gentlemen for that verdict of guilty which in the
circumstances I regard you as unfortunately bound to record

 Letting his eyes travel from the JUDGE and the jury to FROME he
 sits down

THE JUDGE Bending a little towards the jury and speaking in a
businesslike voice Gentlemen you have heard the evidence and the
comments on it My only business is to make clear to you the issues
you have to try The facts are admitted so far as the alteration of
this cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner The defence set up is
that he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the
crime Well you have heard the prisoners story and the evidence
of the other witnessesso far as it bears on the point of insanity
If you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the
prisoner was insane at the time of the forgery you will find him
guilty but insane If on the other hand you conclude from what
you have seen and heard that the prisoner was saneand nothing short
of insanity will countyou will find him guilty In reviewing the
testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very
carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before
and after the act of forgerythe evidence of the prisoner himself
of the woman of the witnesserCOKESON anderof the cashier
And in regard to that I especially direct your attention to the
prisoners admission that the idea of adding the ty and the nought
did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to
him and also to the alteration of the counterfoil and to his
subsequent conduct generally The bearing of all this on the
question of premeditation and premeditation will imply sanity is
very obvious You must not allow any considerations of age or
temptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict Before
you can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and
thoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would
have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum He pauses
then seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no
adds You may retire gentlemen if you wish to do so

 The jury retire by a door behind the JUDGE The JUDGE bends
 over his notes FALDER leaning from the dock speaks excitedly
 to his solicitor pointing dawn at RUTH The solicitor in turn
 speaks to FROME

FROME Rising My lord The prisoner is very anxious that I should
ask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to
disclose the name of the woman witness in the Press reports of these
proceedings Your lordship will understand that the consequences
might be extremely serious to her

THE JUDGE Pointedlywith the suspicion of a smile well Mr
Frome you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her
here

FROME With an ironic bow If your lordship thinks I could have
brought out the full facts in any other way

THE JUDGE Hm Well

FROME There is very real danger to her your lordship

THE JUDGE You see I have to take your word for all that

FROME If your lordship would be so kind I can assure your
lordship that I am not exaggerating

THE JUDGE It goes very much against the grain with me that the name
of a witness should ever be suppressed With a glance at FALDER
who is gripping and clasping his hands before him and then at RUTH
who is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on FALDER Ill
consider your application It must depend I have to remember that
she may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoners behalf

FROME Your lordship I really

THE JUDGE Yes yesI dont suggest anything of the sort Mr
Frome Leave it at that for the moment

 As he finishes speaking the jury return and file back into the
 box

CLERK of ASSIZE Gentlemen are you agreed on your verdict

FOREMAN We are

CLERK of ASSIZE Is it Guilty or Guilty but insane

FOREMAN Guilty

 The JUDGE nods then gathering up his notes sits looking at
 FALDER who stands motionless

FROME Rising If your lordship would allow me to address you in
mitigation of sentence I dont know if your lordship thinks I can
add anything to what I have said to the jury on the score of the
prisoners youth and the great stress under which he acted

THE JUDGE I dont think you can Mr Frome

FROME If your lordship says soI do most earnestly beg your
lordship to give the utmost weight to my plea He sits down

THE JUDGE To the CLERK Call upon him

THE CLERK Prisoner at the bar you stand convicted of felony Have
you anything to say for yourself why the Court should not give you
judgment according to law FALDER shakes his head

THE JUDGE William Falder you have been given fair trial and found
guilty in my opinion rightly found guilty of forgery He pauses
then consulting his notes goes on The defence was set up that you
were not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing
this crime There is no doubt I think that this was a device to
bring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you
succumbed For throughout the trial your counsel was in reality
making an appeal for mercy The setting up of this defence of course
enabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that
direction Whether he was well advised to so is another matter He
claimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a
criminal And this plea of his which in the end amounted to a
passionate appeal he based in effect on an indictment of the march
of Justice which he practically accused of confirming and completing
the process of criminality Now in considering how far I should
allow weight to his appeal I have a number of factors to take into
account I have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your
offence the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the
counterfoil the danger you caused to an innocent manand that to
my mind is a very grave pointand finally I have to consider the
necessity of deterring others from following your example On the
other hand I have to bear in mind that you are young that you have
hitherto borne a good character that you were if I am to believe
your evidence and that of your witnesses in a state of some
emotional excitement when you committed this crime I have every
wish consistently with my dutynot only to you but to the
communityto treat you with leniency And this brings me to what
are the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your
case You are a clerk in a lawyers officethat is a very serious
element in this case there can be no possible excuse made for you on
the ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the
crime you were committing and the penalties that attach to it It
is said however that you were carried away by your emotions The
story has been told here today of your relations with thiserMrs
Honeywill on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were
in effect based Now what is that story It is that you a young
man and she a young woman unhappily married had formed an
attachment which you both saywith what truth I am unable to gauge
had not yet resulted in immoral relations but which you both admit
was about to result in such relationship Your counsel has made an
attempt to palliate this on the ground that the woman is in what he
describes I think as a hopeless position As to that I can
express no opinion She is a married woman and the fact is patent
that you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral
design Now however I might wish I am not able to justify to my
conscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality
It is vitiated ab initio and would if successful free you for
the completion of this immoral project Your counsel has made an
attempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a
defect in the marriage law he has made an attempt also to show that
to punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust I do not
follow him in these flights The Law is what it isa majestic
edifice sheltering all of us each stone of which rests on another
I am concerned only with its administration The crime you have
committed is a very serious one I cannot feel it in accordance with
my duty to Society to exercise the powers I have in your favour You
will go to penal servitude for three years

 FALDER who throughout the JUDGES speech has looked at him
 steadily lets his head fall forward on his breast RUTH starts
 up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders There is a
 bustle in court

THE JUDGE Speaking to the reporters Gentlemen of the Press I
think that the name of the female witness should not be reported

 The reporters bow their acquiescence THE JUDGE To RUTH who
 is staring in the direction in which FALDER has disappeared Do
 you understand your name will not be mentioned

COKESON Pulling her sleeve The judge is speaking to you

 RUTH turns stares at the JUDGE and turns away

THE JUDGE I shall sit rather late today Call the next case

CLERK of ASSIZE To a warder Put up John Booley

 To cries of Witnesses in the case of Booley

ACT III

SCENE I

 A prison A plainly furnished room with two large barred
 windows overlooking the prisoners exercise yard where men in
 yellow clothes marked with arrows and yellow brimless caps are
 seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other
 walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete
 floor of the yard Two warders in blue uniforms with peaked
 caps and swords are stationed amongst them The room has
 distempered walls a bookcase with numerous officiallooking
 books a cupboard between the windows a plan of the prison on
 the wall a writingtable covered with documents It is
 Christmas Eve

 The GOVERNOR a neat gravelooking man with a trim fair
 moustache the eyes of a theorist and grizzled hair receding
 from the temples is standing close to this writingtable
 looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal
 The hand in which he holds it is gloved for two fingers
 are missing The chief warder WOODER a tall thin
 militarylooking man of sixty with grey moustache and
 melancholy monkeylike eyes stands very upright two paces
 from him

THE GOVERNOR With a faint abstracted smile Queerlooking
affair Mr Wooder Where did you find it

WOODER In his mattress sir Havent come across such a thing for
two years now

THE GOVERNOR With curiosity Had he any set plan

WOODER Hed sawed his windowbar about that much He holds up his
thumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart

THE GOVERNOR Ill see him this afternoon Whats his name
Moaney An old hand I think

WOODER Yes sirfourth spell of penal Youd think an old lag like
him would have had more sense by now With pitying contempt
Occupied his mind he said Breaking in and breaking outthats all
they think about

THE GOVERNOR Whos next him

WOODER OCleary sir

THE GOVERNOR The Irishman

WOODER Next him again theres that young fellow Falderstar
classand next him old Clipton

THE GOVERNOR Ah yes The philosopher I want to see him about
his eyes

WOODER Curious thing sir they seem to know when theres one of
these tries at escape going on It makes them restivetheres a
regular wave going through them just now

THE GOVERNOR Meditatively Odd thingsthose waves Turning to
look at the prisoners exercising Seem quiet enough out here

WOODER That Irishman OCleary began banging on his door this
morning Little thing like thats quite enough to upset the whole
lot Theyre just like dumb animals at times

THE GOVERNOR Ive seen it with horses before thunderitll run
right through cavalry lines

 The prison CHAPLAIN has entered He is a darkhaired ascetic
 man in clerical undress with a peculiarly steady tightlipped
 face and slow cultured speech

THE GOVERNOR Holding up the saw Seen this Miller

THE CHAPLAIN Usefullooking specimen

THE GOVERNOR Do for the Museum eh He goes to the cupboard and
opens it displaying to view a number of quaint ropes hooks and
metal tools with labels tied on them Thatll do thanks Mr
Wooder

WOODER Saluting Thank you sir He goes out

THE GOVERNOR Account for the state of the men last day or two
Miller Seems going through the whole place

THE CHAPLAIN No I dont know of anything

THE GOVERNOR By the way will you dine with us on Christmas Day

THE CHAPLAIN Tomorrow Thanks very much

THE GOVERNOR Worries me to feel the men discontented Gazing at
the saw Have to punish this poor devil Cant help liking a man
who tries to escape He places the saw in his pocket and locks the
cupboard again

THE CHAPLAIN Extraordinary perverted willpowersome of them
Nothing to be done till its broken

THE GOVERNOR And not much afterwards Im afraid Ground too hard
for golf

 WOODER comes in again

WOODER Visitor whos been seeing Q 3007 asks to speak to you sir
I told him it wasnt usual

THE GOVERNOR What about

WOODER Shall I put him off sir

THE GOVERNOR Resignedly No no Lets see him Dont go
Miller

WOODER motions to some one without and as the visitor comes in
withdraws

 The visitor is COKESON who is attired in a thick overcoat to
 the knees woollen gloves and carries a top hat

COKESON Im sorry to trouble you Ive been talking to the young
man

THE GOVERNOR We have a good many here

COKESON Name of Falder forgery Producing a card and handing it
to the GOVERNOR Firm of James and Walter How Well known in the
law

THE GOVERNOR Receiving the cardwith a faint smile What do you
want to see me about sir

COKESON Suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise Why what a
sight

THE GOVERNOR Yes we have that privilege from here my office is
being done up Sitting down at his table Now please

COKESON Dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window I
wanted to say a word to you I shant keep you long
Confidentially Fact is I oughtnt to be here by rights His
sister came to mehes got no father and motherand she was in some
distress My husband wont let me go and see him she said says
hes disgraced the family And his other sister she said is an
invalid And she asked me to come Well I take an interest in
him He was our juniorI go to the same chapeland I didnt like
to refuse And what I wanted to tell you was he seems lonely here

THE GOVERNOR Not unnaturally

COKESON Im afraid itll prey on my mind I see a lot of them
about working together

THE GOVERNOR Those are local prisoners The convicts serve their
three months here in separate confinement sir

COKESON But we dont want to be unreasonable Hes quite
downhearted I wanted to ask you to let him run about with the
others

THE GOVERNOR With faint amusement Ring the bellwould you
Miller To COKESON Youd like to hear what the doctor says about
him perhaps

THE CHAPLAIN Ringing the bell You are not accustomed to prisons
it would seem sir

COKESON No But its a pitiful sight Hes quite a young fellow
I said to him Before a months up I said youll be out and about
with the others itll be a nice change for you A month he said
like that Come I said we mustnt exaggerate Whats a
month Why its nothing A day he said shut up in your cell
thinking and brooding as I do its longer than a year outside I
cant help it he said I trybut Im built that way Mr
COKESON And he held his hand up to his face I could see the
tears trickling through his fingers It wasnt nice

THE CHAPLAIN Hes a young man with large rather peculiar eyes
isnt he Not Church of England I think

COKESON No

THE CHAPLAIN I know

THE GOVERNOR To WOODER who has come in Ask the doctor to be
good enough to come here for a minute WOODER salutes and goes
out Lets see hes not married

COKESON No Confidentially But theres a party hes very much
attached to not altogether comilfa Its a sad story

THE CHAPLAIN If it wasnt for drink and women sir this prison
might be closed

COKESON Looking at the CHAPLAIN over his spectacles Yees but I
wanted to tell you about that special He had hopes theyd have let
her come and see him but they havent Of course he asked me
questions I did my best but I couldnt tell the poor young fellow
a lie with him in hereseemed like hitting him But Im afraid
its made him worse

THE GOVERNOR What was this news then

COKESON Like this The woman had a nahsty spiteful feller for a
husband and shed left him Fact is she was going away with our
young friend Its not nicebut Ive looked over it Well when he
was put in here she said shed earn her living apart and wait for
him to come out That was a great consolation to him But after a
month she came to meI dont know her personallyand she said
I cant earn the childrens living let alone my ownIve got no
friends Im obliged to keep out of everybodys way else my
husbandd get to know where I was Im very much reduced she said
And she has lost flesh Ill have to go in the workhouse Its a
painful story I said to her No I said not that Ive got a
wife an family but sooner than you should do that Ill spare you a
little myself Really she saidshes a nice creatureI dont
like to take it from you I think Id better go back to my husband
Well I know hes a nahsty spiteful fellerdrinksbut I didnt
like to persuade her not to

THE CHAPLAIN Surely no

COKESON Yees but Im sorry now its upset the poor young fellow
dreadfully And what I wanted to say was Hes got his three years
to serve I want things to be pleasant for him

THE CHAPLAIN With a touch of impatience The Law hardly shares
your view Im afraid

COKESON But I cant help thinking that to shut him up there by
himselfll turn him silly And nobody wants that I spose I dont
like to see a man cry

THE CHAPLAIN Its a very rare thing for them to give way like that

COKESON Looking at himin a tone of sudden dogged hostility
I keep dogs

THE CHAPLAIN Indeed

COKESON Yees And I say this I wouldnt shut one of them up all
by himself month after month not if hed bit me all over

THE CHAPLAIN Unfortunately the criminal is not a dog he has a
sense of right and wrong

COKESON But thats not the way to make him feel it

THE CHAPLAIN Ah there Im afraid we must differ

COKESON Its the same with dogs If you treat em with kindness
theyll do anything for you but to shut em up alone it only makes
em savage

THE CHAPLAIN Surely you should allow those who have had a little
more experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners

COKESON Doggedly I know this young feller Ive watched him for
years Hes euroticgot no stamina His father died of
consumption Im thinking of his future If hes to be kept there
shut up by himself without a cat to keep him company itll do him
harm I said to him Where do you feel it I cant tell you Mr
COKESON he said but sometimes I could beat my head against the
wall Its not nice

 During this speech the DOCTOR has entered He is a
 mediumSized rather goodlooking man with a quick eye
 He stands leaning against the window

THE GOVERNOR This gentleman thinks the separate is telling on
Q 3007Falder young thin fellow star class What do you say
Doctor Clements

THE DOCTOR He doesnt like it but its not doing him any harm

COKESON But hes told me

THE DOCTOR Of course hed say so but we can always tell Hes
lost no weight since hes been here

COKESON Its his state of mind Im speaking of

THE DOCTOR His minds all right so far Hes nervous rather
melancholy I dont see signs of anything more Im watching him
carefully

COKESON Nonplussed Im glad to hear you say that

THE CHAPLAIN More suavely Its just at this period that we are
able to make some impression on them sir I am speaking from my
special standpoint

COKESON Turning bewildered to the GOVERNOR I dont want to be
unpleasant but having given him this news I do feel its awkward

THE GOVERNOR Ill make a point of seeing him today

COKESON Im much obliged to you I thought perhaps seeing him
every day you wouldnt notice it

THE GOVERNOR Rather sharply If any sign of injury to his health
shows itself his case will be reported at once Thats fully
provided for He rises

COKESON Following his own thoughts Of course what you dont see
doesnt trouble you but having seen him I dont want to have him on
my mind

THE GOVERNOR I think you may safely leave it to us sir

COKESON Mollified and apologetic I thought youd understand me
Im a plain mannever set myself up against authority Expanding
to the CHAPLAIN Nothing personal meant Goodmorning

 As he goes out the three officials do not look at each other
 but their faces wear peculiar expressions

THE CHAPLAIN Our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital

COKESON Returning suddenly with an apologetic air Theres just
one little thing This womanI suppose I mustnt ask you to let him
see her Itd be a rare treat for them both Hes thinking about
her all the time Of course shes not his wife But hes quite safe
in here Theyre a pitiful couple You couldnt make an exception

THE GOVERNOR Wearily As you say my dear sir I couldnt make an
exception he wont be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes
to a convict prison

COKESON I see Rather coldly Sorry to have troubled you
He again goes out

THE CHAPLAIN Shrugging his shoulders The plain man indeed poor
fellow Come and have some lunch Clements


 He and the DOCTOR go out talking

 The GOVERNOR with a sigh sits down at his table and takes up a
 pen


 The curtain falls



SCENE II

 Part of the ground corridor of the prison The walls are
 coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green
 about the height of a mans shoulder and above this line are
 whitewashed The floor is of blackened stones Daylight is
 filtering through a heavily barred window at the end The doors
 of four cells are visible Each cell door has a little round
 peephole at the level of a mans eye covered by a little round
 disc which raised upwards affords a view o f the cell On
 the wall close to each cell door hangs a little square board
 with the prisoners name number and record

 Overhead can be seen the iron structures of the firstfloor and
 secondfloor corridors

 The WARDER INSTRUCTOR a bearded man in blue uniform with an
 apron and some dangling keys is just emerging from one of the
 cells

INSTRUCTOR Speaking from the door into the cell Ill have
another bit for you when thats finished

OCLEARY Unseenin an Irish voice Little doubt o that sirr

INSTRUCTOR Gossiping Well youd rather have it than nothing I
spose

OCLEARY An thats the blessed truth

 Sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked and of
 approaching footsteps

INSTRUCTOR In a sharp changed voice Look alive over it

 He shuts the cell door and stands at attention

 The GOVERNOR comes walking down the corridor followed by
 WOODER

THE GOVERNOR Anything to report

INSTRUCTOR Saluting Q 3007 he points to a cell is behind
with his work sir Hell lose marks today

 The GOVERNOR nods and passes on to the end cell The INSTRUCTOR
 goes away

THE GOVERNOR This is our maker of saws isnt it

 He takes the saw from his pocket as WOODER throws open the door
 of the cell The convict MOANEY is seen lying on his bed
 athwart the cell with his cap on He springs up and stands in
 the middle of the cell He is a rawboned fellow about
 fiftysix years old with outstanding bats ears and fierce
 staring steelcoloured eyes

WOODER Cap off MOANEY removes his cap Out here MOANEY Comes
to the door

THE GOVERNOR Beckoning him out into the corridor and holding up
the sawwith the manner of an officer speaking to a private
Anything to say about this my man MOANEY is silent Come

MOANEY It passed the time

THE GOVERNOR Pointing into the cell Not enough to do eh

MOANEY It dont occupy your mind

THE GOVERNOR Tapping the saw You might find a better way than
this

MOANEY Sullenly Well What way I must keep my hand in against
the time I get out Whats the good of anything else to me at my
time of life With a gradual change to civility as his tongue
warms Ye know that sir Ill be in again within a year or two
after Ive done this lot I dont want to disgrace meself when Im
out Youve got your pride keeping the prison smart well Ive got
mine Seeing that the GOVERNOR is listening with interest he goes
on pointing to the saw I must be doin a little o this Its no
harm to any one I was five weeks makin that sawa bit of all

and water You cant help it sir I know thatI quite put meself

THE GOVERNOR Now look here Moaney if I pass it over will you

cell walks to the end of it mounts the stool and tries the
windowbars

THE GOVERNOR Returning Well

MOANEY Who has been reflecting Ive got another six weeks to do
in here alone I cant do it and think o nothing I must have
something to interest me Youve made me a sporting offer sir but
I cant pass my word about it I shouldnt like to deceive a
gentleman Pointing into the cell Another four hours steady work
would have done it

THE GOVERNOR Yes and what then Caught brought back punishment
Five weeks hard work to make this and cells at the end of it while
they put anew bar to your window Is it worth it Moaney

MOANEY With a sort of fierceness Yes it is

THE GOVERNOR Putting his hand to his brow Oh well Two days
cellsbread and water

MOANEY Thank e sir

 He turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell

 The GOVERNOR looks after him and shakes his head as WOODER
 closes and locks the cell door

THE GOVERNOR Open Cliptons cell

 WOODER opens the door of CLIPTONS cell CLIPTON is sitting on
 a stool just inside the door at work on a pair of trousers He
 is a small thick oldish man with an almost shaven head and
 smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles He gets
 up and stands motionless in the doorway peering at his
 visitors

THE GOVERNOR Beckoning Come out here a minute Clipton

 CLIPTON with a sort of dreadful quietness comes into the
 corridor the needle and thread in his hand The GOVERNOR signs
 to WOODER who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully

THE GOVERNOR How are your eyes

CLIFTON I dont complain of them I dont see the sun here He
makes a stealthy movement protruding his neck a little Theres
just one thing Mr Governor as youre speaking to me I wish youd
ask the cove next door here to keep a bit quieter

THE GOVERNOR Whats the matter I dont want any tales Clipton

CLIPTON He keeps me awake I dont know who he is With
contempt One of this star class I expect Oughtnt to be here
with us

THE GOVERNOR Quietly Quite right Clipton Hell be moved when
theres a cell vacant

CLIPTON He knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning
Im not used to itstops me getting my sleep out In the evening
too Its not fair Mr Governor as youre speaking to me
Sleeps the comfort Ive got here Im entitled to take it out full

 WOODER comes out of the cell and instantly as though
 extinguished CLIPTON moves with stealthy suddenness back into
 his cell

WOODER All right sir

 THE GOVERNOR nods The door is closed and locked

THE GOVERNOR Which is the man who banged on his door this morning

WOODER Going towards OCLEARYS cell This one sir OCleary

 He lifts the disc and glances through the peephole

THE GOVERNOR Open

 WOODER throws open the door OCLEARY who is seated at a
 little table by the door as if listening springs up and stands
 at attention jest inside the doorway He is a broadfaced
 middleaged man with a wide thin flexible mouth and little
 holes under his high cheekbones

THE GOVERNOR Wheres the joke OCleary

OCLEARY The joke your honour Ive not seen one for a long time

THE GOVERNOR Banging on your door

OCLEARY Oh that

THE GOVERNOR Well then

OCLEARY But its the great conversation Id have

THE GOVERNOR With a smile Well no more conversation on your
door

OCLEARY No sirr I wud not have the little wit to repeat meself

THE GOVERNOR Turning Goodnight

OCLEARY Goodnight your honour

 He turns into his cell The GOVERNOR shuts the door

THE GOVERNOR Looking at the record card Cant help liking the
poor blackguard

WOODER Hes an amiable man sir

THE GOVERNOR Pointing down the corridor Ask the doctor to come
here Mr Wooder

 WOODER salutes and goes away down the corridor

 The GOVERNOR goes to the door of FALDERS cell He raises his
 uninjured hand to uncover the peephole but without uncovering
 it shakes his head and drops his hand then after scrutinising
 the record board he opens the cell door FALDER who is
 standing against it lurches forward

THE GOVERNOR Beckoning him out Now tell me cant you settle
down Falder

FALDER In a breathless voice Yes sir

THE GOVERNOR You know what I mean Its no good running your head
against a stone wall is it

FALDER No sir

THE GOVERNOR Well come

FALDER I try sir

THE GOVERNOR Cant you sleep

FALDER Very little Between two oclock and getting ups the worst
time

THE GOVERNOR Hows that

FALDER His lips twitch with a sort of smile I dont know sir I
was always nervous Suddenly voluble Everything seems to get such
a size then I feel Ill never get out as long as I live

THE GOVERNOR Thats morbid my lad Pull yourself together

FALDER With an equally sudden dogged resentment YesIve got to

THE GOVERNOR Think of all these other fellows

FALDER Theyre used to it

THE GOVERNOR They all had to go through it once for the first time
just as youre doing now

FALDER Yes sir I shall get to be like them in time I suppose

THE GOVERNOR Rather taken aback Hm Well That rests with
you Now come Set your mind to it like a good fellow Youre
still quite young A man can make himself what he likes

FALDER Wistfully Yes sir

THE GOVERNOR Take a good hold of yourself Do you read

FALDER I dont take the words in Hanging his head I know its
no good but I cant help thinking of whats going on outside In my
cell I cant see out at all Its thick glass sir

THE GOVERNOR Youve had a visitor Bad news

FALDER Yes

THE GOVERNOR You mustnt think about it

FALDER Looking back at his cell How can I help it sir

 He suddenly becomes motionless as WOODER and the DOCTOR
 approach The GOVERNOR motions to him to go back into his cell

FALDER Quick and low Im quite right in my head sir He goes
back into his cell

THE GOVERNOR To the DOCTOR Just go in and see him Clements

 The DOCTOR goes into the cell The GOVERNOR pushes the door to
 nearly closing it and walks towards the window

WOODER Following Sorry you should be troubled like this sir
Very contented lot of men on the whole

THE GOVERNOR Shortly You think so

WOODER Yes sir Its Christmas doing it in my opinion

THE GOVERNOR To himself Queer that

WOODER Beg pardon sir

THE GOVERNOR Christmas

 He turns towards the window leaving WOODER looking at him with
 a sort of pained anxiety

WOODER Suddenly Do you think we make show enough sir If youd
like us to have more holly

THE GOVERNOR Not at all Mr Wooder

WOODER Very good sir

 The DOCTOR has come out of FALDERs Cell and the GOVERNOR
 beckons to him

THE GOVERNOR Well

THE DOCTOR I cant make anything much of him Hes nervous of
course

THE GOVERNOR Is there any sort of case to report Quite frankly
Doctor

THE DOCTOR Well I dont think the separates doing him any good
but then I could say the same of a lot of themtheyd get on better
in the shops theres no doubt

THE GOVERNOR You mean youd have to recommend others

THE DOCTOR A dozen at least Its on his nerves Theres nothing
tangible That fellow there pointing to OCLEARYS cell for
instancefeels it just as much in his way If I once get away from
physical factsI shant know where I am Conscientiously sir I
dont know how to differentiate him He hasnt lost weight Nothing
wrong with his eyes His pulse is good Talks all right

THE GOVERNOR It doesnt amount to melancholia

THE DOCTOR Shaking his head I can report on him if you like but
if I do I ought to report on others

THE GOVERNOR I see Looking towards FALDERS cell The poor
devil must just stick it then

 As he says thin he looks absently at WOODER

WOODER Beg pardon sir

 For answer the GOVERNOR stares at him turns on his heel and
 walks away There is a sound as of beating on metal

THE GOVERNOR Stopping Mr Wooder

WOODER Banging on his door sir I thought we should have more of
that

 He hurries forward passing the GOVERNOR who follows closely


 The curtain falls



SCENE III

 FALDERs cell a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven
 deep and nine feet high with a rounded ceiling The floor is
 of shiny blackened bricks The barred window of opaque glass
 with a ventilator is high up in the middle of the end wall In
 the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door In a
 corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up two blankets two
 sheets and a coverlet Above them is a quartercircular
 wooden shelf on which is a Bible and several little devotional
 books piled in a symmetrical pyramid there are also a black
 hair brush toothbrush and a bit of soap In another corner
 is the wooden frame of a bed standing on end There is a dark
 ventilator under the window and another over the door
 FALDERS work a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes is
 hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table on which
 the novel Lorna Doone lies open Low down in the corner by
 the door is a thick glass screen about a foot square covering
 the gasjet let into the wall There is also a wooden stool and
 a pair of shoes beneath it Three bright round tins are set
 under the window

 In fastfailing daylight FALDER in his stockings is seen
 standing motionless with his head inclined towards the door
 listening He moves a little closer to the door his stockinged
 feet making no noise He stops at the door He is trying
 harder and harder to hear something any little thing that is
 going on outside He springs suddenly uprightas if at a
 soundand remains perfectly motionless Then with a heavy
 sigh he moves to his work and stands looking at it with his
 head doom he does a stitch or two having the air of a man so
 lost in sadness that each stitch is as it were a coming to
 life Then turning abruptly he begins pacing the cell moving
 his head like an animal pacing its cage He stops again at the
 door listens and placing the palms of hip hands against it
 with his fingers spread out leans his forehead against the
 iron Turning from it presently he moves slowly back towards
 the window tracing his way with his finger along the top line
 of the distemper that runs round the wall He stops under the
 window and picking up the lid of one of the tins peers into
 it It has grown very nearly dark Suddenly the lid falls out
 of his hand with a clatterthe only sound that has broken the
 silenceand he stands staring intently at the wall where the
 stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darknesshe
 seems to be seeing somebody or something there There is a
 sharp tap and click the cell light behind the glass screen has
 been turned up The cell is brightly lighted FALDER is seen
 gasping for breath

 A sound from far away as of distant dull beating on thick
 metal is suddenly audible FALDER shrinks back not able to
 bear this sudden clamour But the sound grows as though some
 great tumbril were rolling towards the cell And gradually it
 seems to hypnotise him He begins creeping inch by inch
 nearer to the door The banging sound travelling from cell to
 cell draws closer and closer FALDERS hands are seen moving as
 if his spirit had already joined in this beating and the sound
 swells till it seems to have entered the very cell He suddenly
 raises his clenched fists Panting violently he flings himself
 at his door and beats on it


 The curtain falls




ACT IV

 The scene is again COKESONS room at a few minutes to ten of a
 March morning two years later The doors are all open
 SWEEDLE now blessed with a sprouting moustache is getting the
 offices ready He arranges papers on COKESONS table then goes
 to a covered washstand raises the lid and looks at himself in
 the mirror While he is gazing his full RUTH HONEYWILL comes in
 through the outer office and stands in the doorway There seems
 a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual
 impassivity

SWEEDLE Suddenly seeing her and dropping the lid of the washstand
with a bang Hello Its you

RUTH Yes

SWEEDLE Theres only me here They dont waste their time hurrying
down in the morning Why it must be two years since we had the
pleasure of seeing you Nervously What have you been doing with
yourself

RUTH Sardonically Living

SWEEDLE Impressed If you want to see him he points to COKESONS
chair hell be here directlynever missesnot much Delicately
I hope our friends back from the country His times been up these
three months if I remember RUTH nods I was awful sorry about
that The governor made a mistakeif you ask me

RUTH He did

SWEEDLE He ought to have given him a chanst And I say the judge
ought to ha let him go after that Theyve forgot what human
natures like Whereas we know RUTH gives him a honeyed smile

SWEEDLE They come down on you like a cartload of bricks flatten
you out and when you dont swell up again they complain of it I
know emseen a lot of that sort of thing in my time He shakes
his head in the plenitude of wisdom Why only the other day the
governor

 But COKESON has come in through the outer office brisk with
 east wind and decidedly greyer

COKESON Drawing off his coat and gloves Why its you Then
motioning SWEEDLE out and closing the door Quite a stranger Must

down Family well

RUTH Yes Im not living where I was

RUTH Proudly Ive seen him againthats all over

COKESON Staring at herdisturbed Im a family manI dont want
to hear anything unpleasant Excuse meIm very busy

RUTH Id have gone home to my people in the country long ago but
theyve never got over me marrying Honeywill I never was waywise
Mr Cokeson but Im proud I was only a girl you see when I
married him I thought the world of him of course he used
to come travelling to our farm

COKESON Regretfully I did hope youd have got on better after
you saw me

RUTH He used me worse than ever He couldnt break my nerve but I
lost my health and then he began knocking the children about I
couldnt stand that I wouldnt go back now if he were dying

COKESON Who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a
stream of lava We mustnt be violent must we

RUTH Smouldering A man that cant behave better than that
There is silence

COKESON Fascinated in spite of himself Then there you were And
what did you do then

RUTH With a shrug Tried the same as when I left him before
making skirts cheap things It was the best I could get but I
never made more than ten shillings a week buying my own cotton and
working all day I hardly ever got to bed till past twelve I kept
at it for nine months Fiercely Well Im not fit for that I
wasnt made for it Id rather die

COKESON My dear woman We mustnt talk like that

RUTH It was starvation for the children tooafter what theyd
always had I soon got not to care I used to be too tired She is
silent

COKESON With fearful curiosity Why what happened then

RUTH With a laugh My employer happened thenhes happened ever
since

COKESON Dear Oh dear I never came across a thing like this

RUTH Dully Hes treated me all right But Ive done with that
Suddenly her lips begin to quiver and she hides them with the back
of her hand I never thought Id see him again you see It was just
a chance I met him by Hyde Park We went in there and sat down and
he told me all about himself Oh Mr Cokeson give him another
chance

COKESON Greatly disturbed Then youve both lost your livings
What a horrible position

RUTH If he could only get herewhere theres nothing to find out
about him

COKESON We cant have anything derogative to the firm

RUTH Ive no one else to go to

COKESON Ill speak to the partners but I dont think theyll take
him under the circumstances I dont really

RUTH He came with me hes down there in the street She points to
the window

COKESON On his dignity He shouldnt have done that until hes
sent for Then softening at the look on her face Weve got a
vacancy as it happens but I cant promise anything

RUTH It would be the saving of him

COKESON Well Ill do what I can but Im not sanguine Now tell
him that I dont want him till I see how things are Leave your
address Repeating her 83 Mullingar Street He notes it on
blottingpaper Goodmorning

RUTH Thank you

 She moves towards the door turns as if to speak but does not
 and goes away

COKESON Wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton
handkerchief What a business Then looking amongst his papers he
sounds his bell SWEEDLE answers it

COKESON Was that young Richards coming here today after the
clerks place

SWEEDLE Yes

COKESON Well keep him in the air I dont want to see him yet

SWEEDLE What shall I tell him sir

COKESON With asperity invent something Use your brains Dont
stump him off altogether

SWEEDLE Shall I tell him that weve got illness sir

COKESON No Nothing untrue Say Im not here today

SWEEDLE Yes sir Keep him hankering

COKESON Exactly And look here You remember Falder I may be
having him round to see me Now treat him like youd have him treat
you in a similar position

SWEEDLE I naturally should do

COKESON Thats right When a mans down never hit im Tisnt
necessary Give him a hand up Thats a metaphor I recommend to you
in life Its sound policy

SWEEDLE Do you think the governors will take him on again sir

COKESON Cant say anything about that At the sound of some one
having entered the outer office Whos there

SWEEDLE Going to the door and looking Its Falder sir

COKESON Vexed Dear me Thats very naughty of her Tell him to
call again I dont want

 He breaks off as FALDER comes in FALDER is thin pale older
 his eyes have grown more restless His clothes are very worn
 and loose

 SWEEDLE nodding cheerfully withdraws

COKESON Glad to see you Youre rather previous Trying to keep
things pleasant Shake hands Shes striking while the irons hot
He wipes his forehead I dont blame her Shes anxious

 FALDER timidly takes COKESONs hand and glances towards the
 partners door

COKESON Nonot yet Sit down FALDER sits in the chair at the
aide of COKESONs table on which he places his cap Now you are
here Id like you to give me a little account of yourself Looking
at him over his spectacles Hows your health

FALDER Im alive Mr Cokeson

COKESON Preoccupied Im glad to hear that About this matter
I dont like doing anything out of the ordinary its not my habit
Im a plain man and I want everything smooth and straight But I
promised your friend to speak to the partners and I always keep my
word

FALDER I just want a chance Mr Cokeson Ive paid for that job a
thousand times and more I have sir No one knows They say I
weighed more when I came out than when I went in They couldnt
weigh me here he touches his head or here he toucheshis heart
and gives a sort of laugh Till last night Id have thought there
was nothing in here at all

COKESON Concerned Youve not got heart disease

FALDER Oh they passed me sound enough

COKESON But they got you a place didnt they

FALSER Yes very good people knew all about itvery kind to me
I thought I was going to get on first rate But one day all of a
sudden the other clerks got wind of it I couldnt stick it Mr
COKESON I couldnt sir

COKESON Easy my dear fellow easy

FALDER I had one small job after that but it didnt last

COKESON How was that

FALDER Its no good deceiving you Mr Cokeson The fact is I
seem to be struggling against a thing thats all round me I cant
explain it its as if I was in a net as fast as I cut it here it
grows up there I didnt act as I ought to have about references
but what are you to do You must have them And that made me
afraid and I left In fact ImIm afraid all the time now

 He bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table

COKESON I feel for youI do really Arent your sisters going to
do anything for you

FALDER Ones in consumption And the other

COKESON Yees She told me her husband wasnt quite pleased with
you

FALDER When I went therethey were at suppermy sister wanted to
give me a kissI know But he just looked at her and said What
have you come for Well I pocketed my pride and I said Arent
you going to give me your hand Jim Cis is I know I said Look
here he said thats all very well but wed better come to an
understanding Ive been expecting you and Ive made up my mind
Ill give you fifteen pounds to go to Canada with I see I
saidgood riddance No thanks keep your fifteen pounds
Friendships a queer thing when youve been where I have

COKESON I understand Will you take the fifteen pound from me
Flustered as FALDER regards him with a queer smile Quite without
prejudice I meant it kindly

FALDER Im not allowed to leave the country

COKESON Oh yeesticketofleave You arent looking the
thing

FALDER Ive slept in the Park three nights this week The dawns
arent all poetry there But meeting herI feel a different man
this morning Ive often thought the being fond of hers the best
thing about me its sacred somehowand yet it did for me Thats
queer isnt it

COKESON Im sure were all very sorry for you

FALDER Thats what Ive found Mr Cokeson Awfully sorry for me
With quiet bitterness But it doesnt do to associate with
criminals

COKESON Come come its no use calling yourself names That never
did a man any good Put a face on it

FALDER Its easy enough to put a face on it sir when youre
independent Try it when youre down like me They talk about
giving you your deserts Well I think Ive had just a bit over

COKESON Eyeing him askance over his spectacles I hope they havent
made a Socialist of you

 FALDER is suddenly still as if brooding over his past self he
 utters a peculiar laugh

COKESON You must give them credit for the best intentions Really
you must Nobody wishes you harm Im sure

FALDER I believe that Mr Cokeson Nobody wishes you harm but
they down you all the same This feelingHe stares round him as
though at something closing in Its crushing me With sudden
impersonality I know it is

COKESON Horribly disturbed Theres nothing there We must try
and take it quiet Im sure Ive often had you in my prayers Now
leave it to me Ill use my gumption and take em when theyre
jolly As he speaks the two partners come in

COKESON Rather disconcerted but trying to put them all at ease
I didnt expect you quite so soon Ive just been having a talk with
this young man I think youll remember him

JAMES With a grave keen look Quite well How are you Falder

WALTER Holding out his hand almost timidly Very glad to see you
again Falder

FALDER Who has recovered his selfcontrol takes the hand Thank
you sir

COKESON Just a word Mr James To FALDER pointing to the
clerks office You might go in there a minute You know your way
Our junior wont be coming this morning His wifes just had a
little family

 FALDER goes uncertainly out into the clerks office

COKESON Confidentially Im bound to tell you all about it Hes
quite penitent But theres a prejudice against him And youre not
seeing him to advantage this morning hes undernourished Its
very trying to go without your dinner

JAMES Is that so COKESON

COKESON I wanted to ask you Hes had his lesson Now we know all
about him and we want a clerk There is a young fellow applying
but Im keeping him in the air

JAMES A gaolbird in the office COKESON I dont see it

WALTER The rolling of the chariotwheels of Justice Ive never
got that out of my head

JAMES Ive nothing to reproach myself with in this affair Whats
he been doing since he came out

COKESON Hes had one or two places but he hasnt kept them Hes
sensitivequite natural Seems to fancy everybodys down on him

JAMES Bad sign Dont like the fellownever did from the first
Weak characters written all over him

WALTER I think we owe him a leg up

JAMES He brought it all on himself

WALTER The doctrine of full responsibility doesnt quite hold in
these days

JAMES Rather grimly Youll find it safer to hold it for all
that my boy

WALTER For oneself yesnot for other people thanks

JAMES Well I dont want to be hard

COKESON Im glad to hear you say that He seems to see something
spreading his arms round him Tisnt healthy

JAMES What about that woman he was mixed up with I saw some one
uncommonly like her outside as we came in

COKESON That Well I cant keep anything from you He has met
her

JAMES Is she with her husband

COKESON No

JAMES Falder living with her I suppose

COKESON Desperately trying to retain the newfound jollity I
dont know that of my own knowledge Tisnt my business

JAMES Its our business if were going to engage him COKESON

COKESON Reluctantly I ought to tell you perhaps Ive had the
party here this morning

JAMES I thought so To WALTER No my dear boy it wont do Too
shady altogether

COKESON The two things together make it very awkward for youI see
that

WALTER Tentatively I dont quite know what we have to do with
his private life

JAMES No no He must make a clean sheet of it or he cant come
here

WALTER Poor devil

COKESON Will youhave him in And as JAMES nods I think I can
get him to see reason

JAMES Grimly You can leave that to me COKESON

WALTER To JAMES in a low voice while COKESON is summoning
FALDER His whole future may depend on what we do dad

FALDER comes in He has pulled himself together and presents a
steady front

JAMES Now look here Falder My son and I want to give you another
chance but there are two things I must say to you In the first
place Its no good coming here as a victim If youve any notion
that youve been unjustly treatedget rid of it You cant play
fast and loose with morality and hope to go scotfree If Society
didnt take care of itself nobody wouldthe sooner you realise that
the better

FALDER Yes sir butmay I say something

JAMES Well

FALDER I had a lot of time to think it over in prison He stops

COKESON Encouraging him Im sure you did

FALDER There were all sorts there And what I mean sir is that
if wed been treated differently the first time and put under
somebody that could look after us a bit and not put in prison not a
quarter of us would ever have got there

JAMES Shaking his head Im afraid Ive very grave doubts of that
Falder

FALDER With a gleam of malice Yes sir so I found

JAMES My good fellow dont forget that you began it

FALDER I never wanted to do wrong

JAMES Perhaps not But you did

FALDER With all the bitterness of his past suffering Its knocked
me out of time Pulling himself up That is I mean Im not what
I was

JAMES This isnt encouraging for us Falder

COKESON Hes putting it awkwardly Mr James

FALDER Throwing over his caution from the intensity of his
feeling I mean it Mr Cokeson

JAMES Now lay aside all those thoughts Falder and look to the
future

FALDER Almost eagerly Yes sir but you dont understand what
prison is Its here it gets you

 He grips his chest

COKESON In a whisper to James I told you he wanted nourishment

WALTER Yes but my dear fellow thatll pass away Times
merciful

FALDER With his face twitching I hope so sir

JAMES Much more gently Now my boy what youve got to do is to
put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady
reputation And that brings me to the second thing This woman you
were mixed up with you must give us your word you know to have done
with that Theres no chance of your keeping straight if youre
going to begin your future with such a relationship

FALDER Looking from one to the other with a hunted expression But
sir but sir its the one thing I looked forward to
all that time And she too I couldnt find her before last
night

 During this and what follows COKESON becomes more and more
 uneasy

JAMES This is painful Falder But you must see for yourself that
its impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything
Give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight and you can come
backnot otherwise

FALDER After staring at JAMES suddenly stiffens himself I
couldnt give her up I couldnt Oh sir

 Im all shes got to look to And Im sure shes all Ive got

JAMES Im very sorry Falder but I must be firm Its for the
benefit of you both in the long run No good can come of this
connection It was the cause of all your disaster

FALDER But sir it meanshaving gone through all thatgetting
broken upmy nerves are in an awful statefor nothing I did it
for her

JAMES Come If shes anything of a woman shell see it for
herself She wont want to drag you down further If there were a
prospect of your being able to marry herit might be another thing

FALDER Its not my fault sir that she couldnt get rid of him
she would have if she could Thats been the whole trouble from
the beginning Looking suddenly at WALTER If anybody
would help her Its only money wants now Im sure

COKESON Breaking in as WALTER hesitates and is about to speak I
dont think we need consider thatits rather farfetched

FALDER To WALTER appealing He must have given her full cause
since she could prove that he drove her to leave him

WALTER Im inclined to do what you say Falder if it can be
managed

FALDER Oh sir

He goes to the window and looks down into the street

COKESON Hurriedly You dont take me Mr Walter I have my
reasons

FALDER From the window Shes down there sir Will you see her
I can beckon to her from here

 WALTER hesitates and looks from COKESON to JAMES

JAMES With a sharp nod Yes let her come

FALDER beckons from the window

COKESON In a low fluster to JAMES and WALTER No Mr James
Shes not been quite what she ought to ha been while this young
mans been away Shes lost her chance We cant consult how to
swindle the Law

 FALDER has come from the window The three men look at him in a
 sort of awed silence

FALDER With instinctive apprehension of some changelooking from
one to the other Theres been nothing between us sir to prevent
it What I said at the trial was true And last night we
only just sat in the Park

SWEEDLE comes in from the outer office

COKESON What is it

SWEEDLE Mrs Honeywill There is silence

JAMES Show her in

 RUTH comes slowly in and stands stoically with FALDER on one
 side and the three men on the other No one speaks COKESON
 turns to his table bending over his papers as though the burden
 of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed
 groove

JAMES Sharply Shut the door there SWEEDLE shuts the door
Weve asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be
faced in this matter I understand you have only just met Falder
again

RUTH Yesonly yesterday

JAMES Hes told us about himself and were very sorry for him
Ive promised to take him back here if hell make a fresh start
Looking steadily at RUTH This is a matter that requires courage
maam

RUTH who is looking at FALDER begins to twist her hands in front of
her as though prescient of disaster

FALDER Mr Walter How is good enough to say that hell help us to
get you a divorce

 RUTH flashes a startled glance at JAMES and WALTER

JAMES I dont think thats practicable Falder

FALDER But Sir

JAMES Steadily Now Mrs Honeywill Youre fond of him

RUTH Yes Sir I love him

 She looks miserably at FALDER

JAMES Then you dont want to stand in his way do you

RUTH In a faint voice I could take care of him

JAMES The best way you can take care of him will be to give him up

FALDER Nothing shall make me give you up You can get a divorce
Theres been nothing between us has there

RUTH Mournfully shaking her headwithout looking at him No

FALDER Well keep apart till its over sir if youll only help
uswe promise

JAMES To RUTH You see the thing plainly dont you You see
what I mean

RUTH Just above a whisper Yes

COKESON To himself Theres a dear woman

JAMES The situation is impossible

RUTH Must I Sir

JAMES Forcing himself to look at her I put it to you maam His
future is in your hands

RUTH Miserably I want to do the best for him

JAMES A little huskily Thats right thats right

FALDER I dont understand Youre not going to give me upafter
all this Theres somethingStarting forward to JAMES Sir I
swear solemnly theres been nothing between us

JAMES I believe you Falder Come my lad be as plucky as she is

FALDER Just now you were going to help us He starts at RUTH who
is standing absolutely still his face and hands twitch and quiver as
the truth dawns on him What is it Youve not been

WALTER Father

JAMES Hurriedly There there Thatll do thatll do Ill
give you your chance Falder Dont let me know what you do with
yourselves thats all

FALDER As if he has not heard Ruth

 RUTH looks at him and FALDER covers his face with his hands
 There is silence

COKESON Suddenly Theres some one out there To RUTH Go in
here Youll feel better by yourself for a minute

 He points to the clerks room and moves towards the outer
 office FALDER does not move RUTH puts out her hand timidly
 He shrinks back from the touch She turns and goes miserably
 into the clerks room With a brusque movement he follows
 seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway COKESON
 shuts the door

JAMES Pointing to the outer office Get rid of that whoever it
is

SWEEDLE Opening the office door in a scared voice
DetectiveSergeant blister

 The detective enters and closes the door behind him

WISTER Sorry to disturb you sir A clerk you had here two years
and a half ago I arrested him in this room

JAMES What about him

WISTER I thought perhaps I might get his whereabouts from you
There is an awkward silence

COKESON Pleasantly coming to the rescue Were not responsible
for his movements you know that

JAMES What do you want with him

WISTER Hes failed to report himself this last four weeks

WALTER How dyou mean

WISTER Ticketofleave wont be up for another six months sir

WALTER Has he to keep in touch with the police till then

WISTER Were bound to know where he sleeps every night I dare say
we shouldnt interfere sir even though he hasnt reported himself
But weve just heard theres a serious matter of obtaining employment
with a forged reference What with the two things togetherwe must
have him

 Again there is silence WALTER and COKESON steal glances at
 JAMES who stands staring steadily at the detective

COKESON Expansively Were very busy at the moment If you could
make it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then

JAMES Decisively Im a servant of the Law but I dislike
peaching In fact I cant do such a thing If you want him you
must find him without us

 As he speaks his eye falls on FALDERS cap still lying on the
 table and his face contracts

WISTER Noting the gesturequietly Very good sir I ought to
warn you that having broken the terms of his licence hes still a
convict and sheltering a convict

JAMES I shelter no one But you mustnt come here and ask
questions which its not my business to answer

WISTER Dryly I wont trouble you further then gentlemen

COKESON Im sorry we couldnt give you the information You quite
understand dont you Goodmorning

 WISTER turns to go but instead of going to the door of the
 outer office he goes to the door of the clerks room

COKESON The other door the other door

 WISTER opens the clerks door RUTHSs voice is heard Oh
 do and FALDERS I cant There is a little pause then
 with sharp fright RUTH says Whos that

 WISTER has gone in

 The three men look aghast at the door

WISTER From within Keep back please

 He comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in FALDERS The
 latter gives a white staring look at the three men

WALTER Let him go this time for Gods sake

WISTER I couldnt take the responsibility sir

FALDER With a queer desperate laugh Good

 Flinging a look back at RUTH he throws up his head and goes
 out through the outer office half dragging WISTER after him

WALTER With despair That finishes him Itll go on for ever
now

 SWEEDLE can be seen staring through the outer door There are
 sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs suddenly a dull
 thud a faint My God in WISTERs voice

JAMES Whats that

 SWEEDLE dashes forward The door swings to behind him There
 is dead silence

WALTER Starting forward to the inner room The womanshes
fainting

 He and COKESON support the fainting RUTH from the doorway of the
 clerks room

COKESON Distracted Here my dear There there

WALTER Have you any brandy

COKESON Ive got sherry

WALTER Get it then Quick

 He places RUTH in a chairwhich JAMES has dragged forward

COKESON With sherry Here Its good strong sherry They try to
force the sherry between her lips

 There is the sound of feet and they stop to listen

 The outer door is reopenedWISTER and SWEEDLE are seen carrying
 some burden

JAMES Hurrying forward What is it

 They lay the burden doom in the outer office out of sight and
 all but RUTH cluster round it speaking in hushed voices

WISTER He jumpednecks broken

WALTER Good God

WISTER He must have been mad to think he could give me the slip
like that And what was itjust a few months

WALTER Bitterly Was that all

JAMES What a desperate thing Then in a voice unlike his own
Run for a doctoryou SWEEDLE rushes from the outer office An
ambulance

 WISTER goes out On RUTHs face an expression of fear and
 horror has been seen growing as if she dared not turn towards
 the voices She now rises and steals towards them

WALTER Turning suddenly Look

 The three men shrink back out of her way one by one into
 COKESONS room RUTH drops on her knees by the body

RUTH In a whisper What is it Hes not breathing She
crouches over him My dear My pretty

 In the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing

RUTH Leaping to her feet No no No no Hes dead

 The figures of the men shrink back

COKESON Stealing forward In a hoarse voice There there poor
dear woman

 At the sound behind her RUTH faces round at him

COKESON No onell touch him now Never again Hes safe with
gentle Jesus

 RUTH stands as though turned to stone in the doorway staring at
 COKESON who bending humbly before her holds out his hand as
 one would to a lost dog



The curtain falls
